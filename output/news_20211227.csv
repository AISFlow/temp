42389917,89WXKWUN1T5QFoffyf6kmK,1640647800,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Continues Its Low-Volume Rally Before Tapering Off,"(Edited by James Rubin)  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin broke $52,000 briefly, while its supply outside of exchanges reached record highs.  Technician’s take (Editor’s note): Technician’s Take is taking a holiday hiatus. In its place, First Mover Asia is publishing a column by CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $50,866 +.09%  Ether (ETH): $4,043 -0.8%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,791 +1.38%  DJIA: $36,302 +0.9%  Nasdaq: $15,871 +1.39%  Gold: $1,811 +0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, remained at the $51,000 level after it briefly broke above $52,000 during U.S. trading hours on Monday. At the time of publication, bitcoin was hovering just below $51,000. Ether was down slightly just above the $4,000 mark.  But trading activities were mostly muted, as the trading volume of the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization across major centralized exchanges was only slightly higher than it was on Sunday. Bitcoin’s low-volume rally came as stocks in the U.S. also rose in a week that’s traditionally marked by light but bullish trading.  Meanwhile, as the market enters the end of the year, the so-called sovereign supply of bitcoin – total coins held outside of exchange reserves – reached an all-time high, according to blockchain data firm Glassnode.  The growth of bitcoin’s sovereign supply came as its long-term holders saw their ownership stake increase by 4.8% to reach 74.8% of all sovereign supply over the past year, Glassnode noted in its Dec. 27 newsletter. Short-term holders’ bitcoin ownership dropped from 28% this past January to 25.2% now.  “Such on-chain behavior is more typically observed during bitcoin bear markets, which in hindsight are effectively lengthy periods of coin redistribution from weaker hands, to those with stronger, and longer-term conviction,” Glassnode wrote.  Column  5 Ways Money Was Reimagined in 2021:Michael Casey looks back at a tumultuous year for money. (By CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey)  It was the year of crypto!  For this, the first of two holiday editions of this Money Reimagined column, we frame this remarkable year in terms of how, in different ways, money was reimagined in 2021. We look at five themes, with links to past newsletters and podcasts.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In 2021, money became…  A meme  Whether it was the mania for dogecoin, the surge of interest in non-fungible tokens or the capacity for Wall Street Bets to set the price of “meme stocks” like GameStop, we witnessed a strange merging of finance and popular culture. As incredulous as people were in both traditional financial and Bitcoin circles, we at Money Reimagined felt somewhat vindicated. The trend underscored a theme we’ve explored in both the newsletter and the podcast: that monetary systems require a shared belief in their common value. This era of reimagined money is bound to see the deployment of art, iconography, stories and other cultural products to bolster the sense of belonging and belief among communities that form around these new systems.  A politicized idea  For the past century, no one really questioned the nature and structure of our systems of money. Money was issued by governments and it was run by banks. End of story. With the emergence of Bitcoin, there was suddenly a new way to think about things. But for most of its existence, the political class felt it could simply ignore it.  In 2021, that blissful ignorance suddenly became impossible. We first saw this with the debate over the infrastructure bill, most importantly in the U.S. Senate, when the impositions of a contentious tax reporting provision for cryptocurrency sales had the ironic effect of demonstrating that crypto had arrived in Washington. The fact that legislators wanted to tax crypto was a sign that it was recognized as a long-term prospect, a reliable source of tax revenue. Just as importantly, the crypto lobby, though ultimately unsuccessful in its bid to force changes to those more draconian parts of the provision, showed its clout on Capitol Hill has grown significantly. It forged a large, bipartisan coalition of lawmakers to support its preferred amendments and showed it will be a force.  Around the same time, the conversation around stablecoins as alternatives to central bank digital currencies started taking on greater appreciation in Washington. Randal Quarles, who was vice chairman of the Federal Reserve until he resigned from the post in November, even argued that stablecoins could bolster U.S. power overseas by tapping into private sector innovation that central banks inherently won’t have access to. That set the stage for an intense debate on stablecoins through the summer and fall, particularly around whether issuers of stable tokens such as USDC and PAX should be required to get banking licenses.  Finally, in December, a crypto hearing in the House of Representatives revealed something that none of us would have predicted a year ago: some very well-informed questions from lawmakers. It seems that many in Congress have finally done their crypto homework. We had Nik De, CoinDesk’s managing editor for global policy and regulation, on the podcast to discuss it.  A matter of geopolitical importance  Even if it took federal politicians some time to wake up to the political ramifications of cryptocurrencies and of the central bank-led alternatives they helped spawn, China’s rapid development of the latter had caught the attention of academics and think tanks. They recognized that Beijing’s deployment of its Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DCEP) system, which went in for heavy testing in 2021, has the potential to disrupt U.S. dominance of the global financial system.  What few saw coming was that China would also forfeit a dominance of bitcoin mining that it had for many years by launching a crackdown against such operations around the country. That led to a massive drop in the Bitcoin network’s capacity, as about half of the global hashrate, or computing power, shut down. But that hash power soon moved elsewhere, and especially to the U.S. By October, the U.S. had become the biggest mining location in the world. Already people are talking about what this increased role for the U.S. in a decentralized currency means for the U.S. as China pushes its centralized monetary solution on the world.  A speculative force for social innovation  In 2020, the speculative fervor around decentralized finance fueled such a powerful flywheel of investment capital and innovation that it helped frame our look back on the 12 months that preceded the one-year anniversary of the “Money Reimagined” podcast this past October. In 2021, the phenomenon was taken to a new level as speculation around non-fungible tokens fueled a flurry of ideas around the future of media, art and collectibles, which in turn kept attracting more and more money into the space. It all felt very much like a bubble, but it was also clear that speculation in this case was a feature, not a bug, a powerful driver of change – even if we don’t yet know where that change is ultimately taking us.  A dinner party conversation  Perhaps the biggest theme of 2021 was simply how mainstream crypto had become in terms of public awareness. With the NFT zeitgeist, soaring token prices, the fact that Washington was more interested to learn about it and the ideas that swirled around bitcoin being a bet against a failing monetary system, crypto was suddenly everywhere. Everyone wanted to understand it. Meanwhile, plenty of people who did understand it, as well as many who didn’t, formed strong views on crypto’s pros and cons.

According to the crypto pricing site CoinGecko, the UST market cap pushed past $10 billion on Sunday. As recently as the beginning of 2021, the market capitalization was under $200 million.  Earlier in December, UST overtook rival MakerDao’s decentralized stablecoin DAI, whose market capitalization sits at around $9.4 billion. And DAI has been live since 2017.  The fast growth in UST comes as the Terra blockchain has become a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, where stablecoins play a critical role in staking, liquidity management and yield-generating.  Terra’s LUNA token has been one of the top performers among all digital assets this year, jumping 15-fold in price to a reported market capitalization of $34 billion, according to the crypto data site Messari.  Last week, Terra overtook Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for second place in total value locked (TVL), a metric used to compare the DeFi activity occurring on various blockchains or for individual projects. According to data provider DeFi Llama, Terra boasts $17.9 billion in locked assets, versus $17.3 billion for BSC. The Ethereum blockchain sits comfortably in first place with over $162 billion in DeFi total value locked.  The most popular DeFi project in the Terra ecosystem is Anchor, a lending protocol with nearly $9 billion in TVL, accounting for over half of all DeFi activity on Terra.  A popular trade involves users depositing UST into the Anchor protocol, where the tokens are subsequently pooled and lent out to interest-paying borrowers. The accrued interest is then distributed pro rata to all depositors, who expect to earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of 20%.

During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap this year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (If you’re looking for today’s prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  In a recent episode of this year-in-review series, we recapped the onslaught of fear, uncertainty and doubt – “FUD,” in crypto-speak, meaning really any negative headlines – that shook crypto markets in April and May. Mood dampeners included the threat of higher U.S. capital gains taxes, China’s reinvigorated efforts to stamp out cryptocurrency trading and mining and the potential environmental harms from the Bitcoin blockchain’s extensive electricity usage.  Today, we’ll show additional reasons for widespread selling that occurred in April and May. After bitcoin’s powerful rally to start the year, fueled by fear of fast inflation, some large investors grew concerned about rampant speculation in the almost-anything-goes market and a slowdown in global money supply growth. In fact, some price chart indicators were already suggesting that bitcoin was overvalued. By June, BTC had stabilized at around $30,000, and guess what happened then? Traders bought the dip.  Funds cash out  Ruffer Investments, a U.K-based asset management company, was one of the earliest big institutional investors to bet on bitcoin – starting in November 2020.  As prices shot up during early 2021, Ruffer essentially rode the wave while other fund managers were just warming up to crypto, lured by its potential for high returns.  “Last November we gained exposure to bitcoin. We viewed it as an option on an emerging store of value with a highly skewed and attractive risk/reward profile,” Duncan MacInnes, investment director at Ruffer Investments, wrote in a blog post on July 9.  But even Ruffer was taken aback by the ferocity of bitcoin’s price rally at the start the year to a new all-time high of around $65,000. And Ruffer cashed out. The market seemed to be unsustainable.  “In 2021, the excitement is in cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. The promise is real. But so, too, is the surge in excess liquidity generated by fiscal stimulus and ongoing quantitative easing. Excess liquidity looked to us to be peaking in April,” MacInnes wrote.  The Sunday Times reported in June that Ruffer made a $1.1 billion profit in five months.  Extreme bullish sentiment  In terms of the market reversal, it sure didn’t help that several crypto-market indicators were flashing signs of excessive buying activity in the month or so leading up to bitcoin’s April price peak. For example, around March, Alternative.me’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index reached the highest level since June 2019, which had preceded a nearly 60% BTC price sell-off.  There were other warning signs in both blockchain data and price charts. (See the chart below, which looks at technical indicators on bitcoin’s “market value to realized value” ratio, a blockchain-based market metric known as MVRV.)  Crypto industry responds to ESG concerns  As nagging environmental concerns over bitcoin’s environmental footprint continued to weigh on the market, crypto-industry executives took steps to respond.  Elon Musk – the billionaire Tesla CEO whose market-moving tweets earlier in the year revealed an on-again, off-again infatuation with bitcoin – sounded a fresh openness to crypto industry dialogue over the Bitcoin blockchain’s electricity usage. Toward the end of May, Musk tweeted that he spoke with bitcoin miners about using renewable energy resources. He wasn’t turning his back on bitcoin completely, which provided some hope for discouraged bulls.  The announcement on May 24 of the Bitcoin Mining Council, which banded together miners and large investors, including MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, sent BTC immediately higher by almost 12%. At that point, market panic from the April sell-off began to fade, and some traders began to buy the dip.  BTC’s price eventually stabilized at about $30,000 in June as extreme selling pressure began to slow. The chart below shows the nearly 50% price drop between April and June. And then, over the course of July and August, bitcoin mostly traded sideways, establishing a new price range as some technical indicators suggested BTC’s price was oversold.  The question in the minds of crypto traders was whether the new market environment represented a pause on the way down or the foundation for a fresh leg up.  Price movements were far less volatile than they had been in recent months, and it seemed as though many investors still believed in bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value. Bitcoin miners claimed to be looking for ways to reduce or mitigate their environmental footprint, and most of the network’s mining power relocated away from crypto-unfriendly China.  Plus, traders weren’t using as much leverage, and market conditions seemed to calm markedly. In other words, there wasn’t much froth.  A key takeaway was that, despite what suddenly seemed to an unrelenting onslaught of negative headlines for the bitcoin market, the price was holding up remarkably well on a historical basis: The April all-time high of around $65,000 was now looking far away, but so was the 2020 low of around $3,850.  Speculation was still running high in other areas of the crypto market. In the next episode, we’ll show how some traders flocked to alternative cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT) while bitcoin traded sideways.

This may mean that a price correction could soon follow. Bitcoin Leverage Ratio Reaches New Highs, Correction Incoming? As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC leverage ratio has made a new ATH recently. This increases the possibility of a correction happening soon to flush out all the excess leverage. The &apos;all exchanges estimated leverage ratio&apos; is an indicator that estimates how much leverage is used by Bitcoin investors on derivatives exchanges, on average. There are two related metrics here. The first is the &apos;open interest,&apos; which measures the total amount of futures contracts currently open in the market. And the other is the &apos;exchange reserve&apos; that tells us how much BTC is stored in derivatives exchange wallets. The value of the leverage ratio is calculated as the open interest divided by the exchange reserve. With the help of this metric, it becomes possible to tell whether investors are currently taking low risk or high risk. When the value of the indicator rises, it means investors are taking on more leverage. High values of the metric may mean the market is currently over-leveraged, which could lead to higher volatility in Bitcoin.

The fashion program, Decentraland’s first, will take place March 24-27. The show will allow users to view fashion in a virtual environment and purchase outfits for their online avatars.  In a Sunday tweet, Decentraland called for designers, brands and fashionistas to have their virtual collections ready to present in the metaverse.  Interest in the metaverse, an environment generated by the convergence of virtual worlds, augmented reality and internet services, has exploded in recent months. By offering a collective virtual experience, it has introduced new opportunities to creators, gamers and artists.  The metaverse may represent a market opportunity of over $1 trillion in annual revenue, crypto investment giant Grayscale said in a report earlier this year. (Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  In another signal of increased interest, Facebook recently changed its corporate name to Meta and announced its metaverse will support non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  In September, UNXD worked with Italian haute couture label Dolce & Gabbana to launch its NFT collection, Collezione Genesi, which fetched approximately $5.65 million in a sale.  With the show, Decentraland is treading a path already opened by South Korean metaverse social media app Zepeto, according to a BBC report.

42375608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw9Hrb,1640610119,Indian Ruling Party-Aligned Group Takes Stance on Crypto Regulation,"An economic group allied to the ideological organization behind India’s ruling party has for the first time revealed its stance on cryptocurrencies, demanding a ban on private digital currencies.  A resolution passed at the 15th national convention of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) in the Indian city of Gwalior also “quickly” sought a law to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to be considered as legal tender and supported the exploration of blockchain technology.  While SJM includes a member of the board of directors of the Reserve Bank of India, Swaminathan Gurumurthy, among its co- founders, observers said it’s unlikely to have much influence over government policy. Even though it is considered the economic arm of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a nationalist group that provides the ideological backing for the ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), its influence over the RSS may be overestimated by some observers, political analysts said.  The SJM is anti-foreign direct investment (FDI) and anti-privatization, while the BJP is a proponent of both policies. A BJP senior leader and Ashwani Mahajan, the co-convenor of SJM, recently had a public online spat about economic policies.  “[The] SJM has in the past raised several issues on which BJP has gone in the diametrically opposite direction,” said Shivam Shankar Singh, a political analyst and the author of “How to Win an Indian Election.”  “From FDI to the sell-off of PSUs [public sector units], SJM has voiced opposition to many such governmental policies, and yet their perspective has been ignored by BJP. It’s unclear if a call by SJM for the banning of cryptocurrencies will have any effect at all on governmental policy,” he added.  It’s a view that has wider support.  ”I don’t think it influences the government,” said Desh Ratan Nigam, a political analyst who supports the RSS. “Probably the government will take note of it like they take note of the views of other organizations. Government has its own thought process on it.”  Central banker Gurumurthy made it clear that the resolution is not a message for the government.  “The RSS or SJM does not give out messages to the government,” he said in an interview. “It is not influencing the position of the government. The government has a larger role to first understand the global position. The Indian government won’t take a position on its own.”  Even so, the organization is not without influence.There was speculation SJM may have been responsible for the premature end of the career of Subhash Chandra Garg, India’s finance secretary from March to July 2019. In India, the finance secretary is critical to every economic decision.  “My departure was my decision,” Garg said. “Though there was one issue at the time around sovereign bonds, which some of them were quite agitated about, and that might have reached the PMO [Prime Minister’s Office]. But I have never felt my decision was because of them.”  That raises the question of whether the Prime Minister’s Office, touted to take the final decision about drafting the cryptocurrency regulation bill, will take note of the SJM resolution. And will the Finance Ministry, responsible for shaping the bill, pay any attention to it?  The SJM has stated that “blockchain technology should not be linked to cryptocurrencies only” but that “the use of this technology in all spheres of economic or social activities must be encouraged,” a position that aligns with the prime minister’s vision that “we must also jointly shape global norms for emerging technologies, like social media and cryptocurrencies, so that they are used to empower democracy, not to undermine it.”  The SJM resolution on cryptocurrency is also broadly in line with the reasons the government and its institutional stakeholders, such as the central bank, have for taking a stand against cryptocurrencies.  “Cryptocurrencies do not have a center of gravity and so, in my opinion, they cannot exist,” RBI’s Gurumurthy said. “The views of SJM are in line with that philosophy.”  The SJM’s reasons, as explained by the Indian Express, were that in cryptocurrencies “there is no underlying asset;” “the issuer is not identifiable;” “the recognition of cryptocurrency may lead to heavy speculation which may adversely impact financial markets;” and that “recognition may result in money laundering and terror financing.”  Reports have indicated the Indian government plans to ban private cryptocurrencies with exceptions to promote the underlying technology. However, the SJM seeks a complete ban on cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ether to avoid them becoming a “medium of exchange like currency.”  The SJM also sought an “aggressive” awareness campaign to advise people not to fall prey to “deceptive advertisements” being circulated by “so-called cryptocurrencies’ exchanges.”  The government’s bill, a draft of which has not been made public, has also reportedly evolved from prohibiting “all private cryptocurrencies” while allowing “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology,” to enabling cryptocurrency to be used as an asset, but banning its use as currency or payment.  CoinDesk has reported the bill is unlikely to become law before May. Several competing priorities ranging from the financial budget, elections in five states and time required for widespread discussions, suggest the government is unlikely to complete the draft bill in time to introduce it in Parliament. Technically, the government could bring in the law through a special-order ordinance, when Parliament is not in session.  The experts CoinDesk spoke to said the government won’t be influenced by the SJM’s position and won’t take it as a message from the RSS to the BJP.  “It is entirely possible that SJM’s call on the matter could shape the opinions of some people within the RSS and some cadres, but since [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi has absolute dominance over RSS-BJP’s combined cadres, the influence of affiliates like SJM seems to be nowhere near a critical mass required to actually influence policies,” said Shivam Shankar Singh, the political analyst.

42389914,89WXKWUN1T5QFoffyf6kgR,1640607478,"Cardano, Polkadot Jump as Bitcoin Holds Above $50K","The tokens of Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT), two rivals to the Ethereum blockchain, led gains among major cryptocurrencies amid a muted recovery in broader digital-asset markets on Monday.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, regained price levels from Friday after seeing a slight dip over an otherwise quiet Christmas weekend.  Bitcoin failed to break above the $51,000 resistance level on Saturday and fell to $49,700 on Sunday, but traders have since bought the asset back to last Friday’s $50,900 level.  ADA gained 9.5% in the past 24 hours to reach a resistance level of $1.56 during European trading hours on Monday. The move came after Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson spoke in a public broadcast of improved network enhancements in 2022 and efforts for more adoption of ADA in regions such as Africa.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a price-chart indicator, turned overbought on ADA following the move. The tool calculates market momentum for assets. An overbought level implies prices are overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective price pullback.  DOT prices rose in the past week as the Polkadot blockchain’s second batch of parachain auctions went live. The cryptocurrency saw similarly overbought levels after an 8% surge to $31.70 in the past 24 hours. Charts showed strength as dips to the $30.80 level in Asian trading hours were bought up by traders.  Parachains are distinct blockchains that run atop the main Polkadot blockchain. Polkadot, however, has a limited number of slots that can support such parachains, meaning winning slots are subject to a community-run auction that uses DOT to vote for slots, leading to increased demand for the cryptocurrency.  Among other large-cap cryptos, tokens of decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI), which relies on smart contracts instead of third parties to execute crypto-to-crypto trades, rose 12% in the past 24 hours to $19.25 on Monday.  Other “blue chip” decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens from 2020 saw similar price jumps. Tokens of lending protocol Aave (AAVE) and synthetic exchange Synthetix (SNX) were up 10% in the past 24 hours while tokens of DeFi platforms Sushi (SUSHI) and Yearn Finance (YFI) were up 7% in a comparable period.  The moves followed chatter among crypto traders on Twitter that token prices of relatively older DeFi applications on Ethereum had turned undervalued – compared to their fundamentals – and could see capital inflow.  Jay Hao, CEO of crypto exchange OKEx, said DeFi tokens would see a further rise in 2022.  “As the crypto industry evolves and investors gain more knowledge about crypto assets, we will see more investments in specific coins which belong to blockchain playing pivotal role in decentralized finance,” Hao said in an email to CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,ADA | DOT,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/27/cardano-polkadot-jump-as-bitcoin-holds-above-50k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fef55d424baca5f07de5c15881e80f6024b154d-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42389905,89WXKWUN1T5QFoffyf6kYC,1640602524,Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Lays Out 2022 Plans,"Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and IOG, its development foundation, revealed some of the plans for the network’s growth in 2022 in a 30-minute Christmas Eve talk on YouTube from his home in Boulder, Colorado.  “My goal for the second half of 2022 is to figure out how to put all the pieces together to get an end-to-end microfinance transaction on Cardano,” Hoskinson said.  The Cardano founder said a structure that oversees the creation of decentralized products on the network would be introduced.  “A formal open-source project structure is going to be formed, kind of like Hyperledger to Linux,” Hoskinson said.  Cardano, founded in 2015 and launched in 2017 as an alternative to Ethereum, is a proof-of-stake blockchain that relies on network validators to process transactions for ADA, its native currency, and maintain the network. It is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $51.18 billion at the time of this writing.  People have previously complained that Cardano hasn’t met its stated goal of being completely decentralized. In 2020, IOG published a paper explaining how it would decentralize its block production, a goal that was reached in April 2021.  The network turned fully community-governed and operated in April this year while September saw the public launch of smart contracts on Cardano, opening up the network’s capability to support decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  DeFi protocols rely on smart contracts instead of third parties to provide financial services such as lending, borrowing and trading. Such protocols lock over $260 billion over various blockchains, as per data from analytics service DeFi Llama.  Public DeFi applications are absent on Cardano in December 2021, but that’s not deterring Hoskinson from visualizing widespread activity on the network in 2022. “A real person in Kenya or somewhere with a blockchain-based identity and credit score, stablecoin on the other side, Cardano is the settlement rail,” he said.  Cardano improvement proposals  Developers are also working on Cardano Improvement Proposals, a set of community-governed network enhancements, that are slated to go live in 2022, Hoskinson said. Some of these include human-readable information for assets issued on Cardano and a native web wallet for interacting with DeFi protocols.  Hoskinson said a recent testnet rollout would improve the network. “Peer-to-peer is currently being tested with the stake pool operators on the testnet, and there’s lots of stuff happening there.”  The peer-to-peer framework aims to make the network more decentralized, with 11 operators initially serving as test subjects on a semi-public testnet. A testnet is a blockchain that runs on the same software as a “mainnet,” allowing developers to test out features and applications before they go live in the real world.  When testing is complete, network validators would be able to communicate directly with each other to process block data instead of relying partly on nodes set up by IOG – a process the development firm says could help aid in creating a more decentralized network.  “We have kicked off an important new initiative to support our ongoing drive toward full decentralization with the launch of a new peer-to-peer (P2P) testnet,” explained IOG in a December 2021 blog post.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/12/27/cardano-founder-charles-hoskinson-lays-out-2022-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5736626f2847fa2dc99de9f7c148e0667b030b19-1300x852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Year-end market wrap  (by CoinDesk Markets Analyst Damanick Dantes)  Market Wrap Year In Review: Remembering Bitcoin’s FUD-Fueled Crash: As crypto markets moved through April and May, many buyers began to cash out as fear, uncertainty and doubt (“FUD”) overwhelmed traders. Concerns included U.S. capital gains taxes on digital assets, bitcoin’s environmental footprint and an outright ban on crypto mining in China.  Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap the year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest digital-asset prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  On Wednesday, we recapped how Tesla’s bitcoin acceptance and Coinbase’s direct listing helped send bitcoin’s price to a new all-time high near $65,000, which turned out, in hindsight, to be the market peak. Today, we’ll show how some traders and investors began to cash out in April and May as concerns mounted over U.S. capital gains taxes, bitcoin’s environmental footprint and an outright crypto ban in China. It seemed like the fear, uncertainty and doubt – FUD, or crypto-speak for negative news – was coming all at once.  Tax selling  All it took was a New York Times headline in mid-April that U.S. President Joe Biden was planning to roughly double the tax on capital gains or proceeds earned from selling assets – with provisions deemed unfriendly toward cryptocurrencies – to end hopes of a rally back toward bitcoin’s all-time high of nearly $65,000. After a powerful bull run earlier in the year, bitcoin’s price decline suddenly accelerated.  “The cryptocurrency was already on the defensive,” Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk in an email at the time. “The tax news invited more profit-taking.”  “The U.S. actions were not bullish for bitcoin, as tax increases could be a thorn in the recovery and will drag down investments,” Edward Moya, an analyst at Oanda, a foreign exchange brokerage firm, wrote in an email.  Some analysts pointed to a stronger U.S. dollar as a potential headwind for bitcoin (BTC). Warmer weather was coming in the Northern Hemisphere, and more coronavirus vaccines were getting distributed around the world, leading to a sunnier economic outlook. It appeared as though the U.S. was on its way to improving the budget deficit, which widened during the pandemic stimulus program.  All that meant there might be less need for extra economic support from governments and central banks, which had bolstered bitcoin’s attractiveness among investors as a possible hedge against fast inflation.  Environmental concerns  But bitcoin had other problems. In the months ahead, many investors in traditional markets – perceived as a key target for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption – would start to question the cryptocurrency’s environmental footprint – due to the blockchain network’s heavy electricity usage.  Tesla’s billionaire CEO, Elon Musk, for example, made a U-turn from his earlier bullish stance on bitcoin and decided to no longer accept BTC as payment for his company’s electric cars, citing concerns about the use of fossil fuels in crypto mining.  Musk’s tweet triggered an immediate 6% drop in the bitcoin price. Suddenly, the environment became front and center as an impediment in the 12-year-old cryptocurrency’s path to becoming a widely acceptable asset class. And with environmental, social and governance (ESG) becoming the new buzzwords on Wall Street, it became harder to convince big money managers that energy-intensive bitcoin was a good addition to portfolios.  For example, a survey of 600 people in the fund management industry found that 96% expected their firms to increase prioritization of ESG during 2021. John Reed Stark, former chief of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Internet Enforcement, told CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma in May that the bitcoin ESG concerns would certainly damp institutional investment in crypto.  China’s crypto ban  And just when bitcoin traders thought they had seen enough of the fear, uncertainty and doubt, China officially banned all financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions.  China had been banning things related to crypto since 2013, but the fresh crackdown made it clear that crypto trading activity involved “legal risks” and that “any legal person, unincorporated organization or natural person” investing in virtual currency and related derivatives was violating “public order and good customs,” CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported.  News of the China ban sent bitcoin sharply lower, which left the price down roughly 50% from the April record of almost $65,000. By almost any definition, the bitcoin market had entered a new, bearish phase.  The China-related sell-off wiped $400 billion off the crypto market, which encouraged some “whales” – large BTC holders – to move their coins onto exchanges for sale. Crypto markets were in panic mode.  It also dawned on investors just how vulnerable cryptocurrencies were to regulatory risk. Whether it was concerns about capital gains taxes or the outright crypto ban in China, bitcoin’s euphoric rise appeared stunted by the increased scrutiny from governments and supervisors of the traditional financial system.  More work would be needed before environmentally conscious investors would start piling into bitcoin.
