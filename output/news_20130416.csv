42424826,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWkFh,1366088068,Meet the money behind bitcoin competitor OpenCoin,"At first glance, especially to a digital currency neophyte, OpenCoin might not look that different from Bitcoin. Look beyond the superficial similarities, though, and the two ventures in virtual money couldn’t be less alike.  That’s especially true in terms of the people – and money – behind the currencies.  Bitcoin, after all, was birthed in a way by a cipher … a man (or entity) who isn’t there. (Theories abound as to who or what Satoshi Nakamoto is or was.)  Nor did Bitcoin enjoy the advantages of big names and big money as it grew: its popularity grew through its appeal to a certain (often libertarian) segment of the online geek community, expanding – if you will – organically through widening appreciation of its cryptographic ingenuity.  OpenCoin, on the other hand, has the backing of some leading luminaries of the digital.  CEO Chris Larsen previously co-founded and led the online lender E-LOAN and the P2P marketplace Prosper. And CTO Jed McCaleb created both eDonkey (the largest P2P file sharing network in 2000) and Mt. Gox, which is now the leading Bitcoin exchange.  And then there are the money people. The list of investors in OpenCoin reads like an internet who’s who: Andreessen Horowitz (yes, that Andreessen), along with Ben Horowitz; Lightspeed Venture Partners; and the Founder’s Fund, whose partners include PayPal founder Peter Thiel.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/16/meet-the-money-behind-bitcoin-competitor-opencoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424813,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWjth,1366077191,OpenCoin aims to build a better digital currency,"Digital currency promises to solve some problems of the ""real money"" world, among them the difficulty of making quick, secure global payments without having to pay a middleman steep fees to exchange one currency for another.  While bitcoins have proven they can do the trick, the currency comes with its own problems. Bitcoin can take 10 minutes or more to verify a payment (or transaction of any kind) … and that's if you can find a retailer that actually accepts bitcoins. That's where OpenCoin hopes to step in with a more convenient alternative.  Launched by two veterans of the online economy – Chris Larsen, a co-founder of E-LOAN, and Jed McCaleb, who created the bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox – OpenCoin is placing its bets on a new digital currency payment network called Ripple. Similar to bitcoin in that it's math-based, Ripple is more easily exchanged with other currencies and enables transactions that can be verified in seconds rather than minutes, according to the company's execs.  OpenCoin enjoys some big-name financial backing, with investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Ventures and the Founder's Fund, whose partners include PayPal founder Peter Thiel.  Early adopters, pay attention, though: Larsen's and McCaleb's OpenCoin (dot-com) is not the same as the OpenCoin project (dot-org), which is behind an open-source form of digital cash. The Ripple (dot-com) currency also has a doppelgänger in the form of the internet-based charity venture ripple (dot-org).",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/16/opencoin-aims-to-build-a-better-digital-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
