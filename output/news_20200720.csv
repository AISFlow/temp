Its creator didn't set aside any of the tokens for himself and he insists the new token has no monetary value.      Still, that hasn't stopped it from trading as high as $2,374 a pop, according to CoinGecko.      YFI is the governance token for Yearn.Finance, a site that performs a variety of functions for DeFi users, moving their assets in and out of different liquidity pools in order to find the best yields. Its name may also be a reference to an unflattering internet acronym.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      ""Each of these systems have control mechanisms, configurable fees, maintenance controls, and rules that can be modified. Thus far, these have been managed by us,"" Yearn's creator, Andre Cronje, wrote in a Medium post. ""In further efforts to give up this control (mostly because we are lazy and don‚Äôt want to do it) we have released YFI, a completely valueless 0 supply token.""      Cronje did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.      ""Earning YFI is simple, provide liquidity to one of the platforms above, stake the output tokens in the distribution contracts (we will provide an interface for this), and you will earn a (governance controlled) amount per day,"" Cronje wrote.      Yearn was able to largely reuse the code Synthetix used to deploy a similar liquidity incentive on Curve, Cronje explained on Twitter.      Users who deposit liquidity in Yearn pools will get yTokens, accounting for their deposits. These are what DeFi‚Äôs itinerant farmhands stake to earn YFI.

42432362,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNC9Lh,1595272844,OpenEthereum Supported 50% of Ethereum Classic Nodes. Now It‚Äôs Leaving the Project,"Update (July 27, 17:45 UTC): This article's language was updated to better reflect the current and future status of Ethereum Classic's node network.    As things stand, only 30% of Ethereum Classic‚Äôs nodes would be able to support future network hard forks after a major client walked away from the project last week.      OpenEthereum has voted to stop supporting its Ethereum Classic client to focus attention on other projects. In addition, it has concerns about that blockchain‚Äôs immutability, according to a GitHub vote Thursday. It's also well known that client Multi-Geth will not support future network updates either for similar reasons.      What this means is, of the 615 current Ethereum Classic nodes listed by ETC Nodes, 425 won‚Äôt update in the future as developers make changes via hard forks (unless the nodes move over to another client or another development house picks up the project).      That leaves Besu, with three nodes, and Core Geth, with 187, to support the network if a hard fork were to occur now. OpenEthereum supports 294 nodes and Multi-Geth supports 131 nodes. The former is a project run by decentralized exchange (DEX) Gnosis that supports Ethereum and Ethereum Classic implementations written in the Solidity programming language.      OpenEthereum has chosen to shut down support for the original Ethereum mainnet to conserve developer energy for its Ethereum client, formerly known as Parity-Ethereum. Gnosis‚Äô OpenEthereum inherited the entire client codebase from Parity Technologies in December.      In a private message, Gnosis Founder Martin K√∂ppelmann told CoinDesk that Gnosis did not have the ‚Äúcapacity or the willingness to get involved into the governance (aka ‚Äúdrama‚Äù) of other chains.‚Äù      ‚ÄúWe explored various options to work with different players from ETC but in the end we felt we want to focus on the thing we know and that is Ethereum,‚Äù he said.    Immutability lost?    Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split ways in 2016 following the exploitation of a vulnerability in The DAO‚Äôs smart contract code. Ethereum developers led by co-founder Vitalik Buterin decided to roll back the Ethereum mainchain to its previous state before The DAO incident in order to recoup lost funds in the exploit.      Read more: Understanding the DAO Attack      Ethereum Classic developers disagreed with the rollback and chose to maintain the original chain in order to keep the value of ‚Äúblockchain immutability‚Äù alive.      With Ethereum Classic's latest hard fork, Phoenix, questions regarding immutability are again at the forefront of community debate.      Phoenix introduced internal changes to the tokenomics of the blockchain network, called OP-CODEs, previously implemented in December 2019 on sister network Ethereum with its Istanbul hard fork. Changing those tokennomics necessarily broke some smart contracts thereby harming the network‚Äôs image as the ‚Äúimmutable‚Äù version of Ethereum, some voiced in the GitHub.      Read more: Hard Fork Sets Stage for Ethereum Classic‚Äôs Second Major Departure From Ethereum      OpenEthereum developer Artem Vorotnikov said that it was perhaps ‚Äútime for a divorce‚Äù between OpenEthereum and Ethereum Classic. That sentiment was shared by Multi-Geth and Parity Tech cord developer Wei Tang in a June blog.      ‚ÄúIf two things are basically the same without even any principle or philosophical differences, if the original good reason that caused the disruptions and splits of ETH and ETC is no longer valid, then I think for a healthy ecosystem of Ethereum, we should follow the majority consensus of ETH, or support a merge of ETH and ETC,‚Äù he wrote.    Ethereum Classic developers respond    In a phone interview with CoinDesk, ETC Labs CEO Terry Culver acknowledged Parity Technologies has been ‚Äúextremely generous‚Äù in its developer support over the years. He suggested that Ethereum Classic developers should be mindful that they have to balance immutability with the need for innovation in Ethereum Classic (ETC Labs maintains Core Geth).      ‚ÄúDogmatism isn‚Äôt helpful,‚Äù Culver said.      In short, a dwindling number of nodes could be a problem for the network. A large and diverse set of nodes is needed to maintain a blockchain resistant to third-party attacks.      ETC Cooperative Executive Director Bob Summerwill pointed CoinDesk to his comment on GitHub urging network developers to transition over to Core Geth or Besu.    Multi-geth is dropping ETC support too, but both core-geth and Hyperledger Besu are both viable options which we will be recommending to end-users.

42432374,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNC9fh,1595272315,Last Week's Big Twitter Hack Was Years in the Making,"Brenna Smith is an open source researcher and contributor for the investigative web site Bellingcat, where she publishes a weekly newsletter about cryptocurrencies, called CryptOsint.      The great Twitter hack of 2020 (or at least so far) was a shock to everyone, most especially the social media company itself. But, it shouldn‚Äôt have been. There was a trail of signs for months leading up to the event spanning multiple social networks and other publicly available sources.      Let‚Äôs flash back to the beginning of June. Sitting on my couch mindlessly scrolling Twitter, I came across a post about a fake SpaceX Youtube account holding a livestream while also peddling an Elon Musk crypto-giveaway.      It was so obviously a scam it felt laughable. An account with 55,000 subscribers, some sort of anime character as its icon, and an ‚Äúabout page‚Äù written in Korean was claiming to be SpaceX?      ‚ÄúWho would ever fall for that?‚Äù I thought.      Hundreds of people, apparently.      By the time I checked back an hour later, the scammers had upped their game. The account now featured SpaceX‚Äôs logo, the appearance of a legitimate ‚Äúabout page,‚Äù and more than 36,000 viewers on the live stream. Ultimately, $200,000 was stolen.      They had managed to hijack a somewhat popular, but relatively dormant, Kpop fan account and turn it into a believable SpaceX dupe. And even if you may disagree if it was convincing or not, the efficacy is hard to dispute when the loot reached six figures.    As surprising as this hack seemed, hijacking a real account is the next natural step to running a fake celebrity account.    Floored, and slightly impressed, I spent the next couple of weeks learning as much as I could about cryptoscams. I discovered that scammers have evolved significantly since the days of sextortion emails (which are still very much a thing).      Essentially since Bitcoin's inception, cybercriminals and scammers have capitalized on the currency to funnel proceeds from emails scams, fake websites and propositions on chat forums.      Then, they began leveraging major social media platforms and impersonating celebrities. Mainstream social media platforms and celebrities provide two critical ingredients to a lucrative hack: a large audience and a semblance of credibility.      As with the fake SpaceX account in June, scammers also became fond of hijacking well-followed but unguarded accounts to further trick people into thinking they were legitimate celebrities. Hijacking verified accounts became a popular scam technique around February 2018. Often the only distinction between them and the legitimate account was an added number or letter to the username.      Cryptoscammers‚Äô favorite targets are usually well-known tech entrepreneurs, such as Elon Musk. According to data from user reports to BitcoinWhosWho, there have already been 225 reported instances of Elon Musk scams across Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube in 2020. Other common targets are Vitalik Buterin, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.      MyCrypto security specialist Harry Denley found that 333 Twitter users were pedaling cryptoscams in 2019. They perpetrated their ploys using random bot accounts, hijacked verified accounts, burner accounts tweeting doctored images and accounts directing users to private profiles with website links in the bio.      Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking: These numbers aren‚Äôt massive. Why should Twitter have paid attention or known there was a problem?      Well, for one thing, I‚Äôm relying on data from user reports. That is only a window into all the cryptoscams perpetrated on Twitter. But more importantly, Twitter wasn‚Äôt just fielding scams on its own social media platform. Often, users will share and post scams happening on YouTube or Facebook on Twitter to warn others, which is how I personally come across most scams.      So in many ways, Twitter was in the perfect position to keep track of and combat these scams because it had access to a fuller picture beyond just its platform.      Fast forward to last Thursday, when allegedly a rag-tag team of 20-something hackers took down Twitter one verified account at a time. As surprising as this hack seemed, hijacking a real account is the next natural step to running a fake celebrity account.      Cryptoscammers were making massive amounts of money using passable fake accounts. So what would happen if they got a hold of the real ones? (A roughly $180,000 in the case of last week‚Äôs events, which many argue was a paltry outcome considering the scale of the attack.)      To be clear, I do not think Twitter could have predicted its Slack would be infiltrated and lead to the hijacking. What it could have predicted was the appetite for cryptoscams on its platform is not only growing but becoming more sophisticated.      The bread crumbs were there. All Twitter needed to do was follow them. But unfortunately, the hackers got to them first, allowing other social media platforms to run free, albeit probably not for long.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | ETH | SPONSORED,Brenna Smith,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/20/last-weeks-big-twitter-hack-was-years-in-the-making,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdf0e12af537c336762d0c44ef05daa112afb63a-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432343,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNC4lh,1595262330,Power Struggle Inside Bitmain 'Hard Forks' Bitcoin Miner Production,"The ongoing battle between the co-founders at Bitmain has now essentially hard forked the world‚Äôs largest bitcoin miner manufacturer into two different operations and supply chains for making its flagship AntMiner equipment.      Wu Jihan, the co-founder who ousted his rival co-founder Micree Zhan Ketuan last year, registered a new entity on July 16 in Shenzhen, China. The new entity, called Guiji Yanghang, is a subsidiary of another recently incorporated company named Beijing Guiyuan Dalu, which is controlled by Wu‚Äôs side.      Wu removed Zhan from Beijing Bitmain in October, following a long-time power struggle between the two. But Zhan made his comeback in June to control the entity again after winning favor from authorities earlier this year.      One person familiar with Wu‚Äôs plan, who wasn‚Äôt authorized to speak, said the new Shenzhen entity is to build out a separate supply chain and manufacturing process for making the AntMiner product. This is a countermove to Zhan also taking over Beijing Bitmain‚Äôs long-time Shenzhen factory after his return to power last month.      Bitmain, which raised more than $700 million in 2018, was once the most-valued crypto startup in the world at a staggering $14.5 billion valuation. But its dominance in the crypto mining industry has been seriously eroded by competitors since last year amid its internal power fight for control of the company.      Wu‚Äôs move is the latest twist in a power struggle that could create greater confusion for global customers buying the firm‚Äôs equipment. It might be unclear, for example, which side would own the AntMiner brand, its shipment logistics and the post-sale services.      Read more: Leaked Transcript Details Power Struggle Inside Bitcoin Mining Giant Bitmain      In an internal letter last Friday, Wu explained to all staff at Bitmain again that he had to return last year to take the reins in order to save Bitmain from a cash flow shortage of several hundred million dollars, allegedly caused by Zhan.      Wu added in the letter that he has initiated an alternative supply chain plan to substitute the role of the existing Shenzhen factory that‚Äôs affecting the firm‚Äôs product shipment.      The official WeChat account of the AntMiner brand maintained by Wu‚Äôs side published a notice on Monday, apologizing to customers that shipments that were already due by the end of June will be delayed again, citing ‚Äúexternal disruption to the company‚Äôs management recently.‚Äù      Further, with Zhan having rehired Bill Zhu, the head of sales at Bitmain who was let go after Wu‚Äôs coup last year, the two sides now also maintain their own sales staff.      ‚ÄúThe next phase of the dispute could focus on the chip ownership [of AntMiner],‚Äù the person said.    Comeback    After being pushed out last October, Zhan, as the largest shareholder of Bitmain, made his way back on June 3 after winning favor from Chinese authorities. In early May, authorities granted him control of Beijing Bitmain Technology, the long-standing operational entity of Bitmain.      In a countermove, Wu registered the Beijing Guiyuan Dalu on May 26 and had been trying to transfer the contracts of employees on his side to the new entity.      Following his return, Zhan also took over Beijing Bitmain‚Äôs Shenzhen factory called Century Cloud Core, where his brother-in-law remains the person in charge, and withheld miner shipments for customers who paid their pre-orders to bank accounts controlled by Wu‚Äôs side.      Read more: Bitmain‚Äôs Power Struggle Takes Toll on Customers as Co-Founder Halts Shipments      A second person with knowledge of Bitmain‚Äôs internal situation said the Shenzhen factory issue caused pressure for Wu from customers whose shipment was due. As such, creating a separate new line of supply chain and production is a method attempting to resolve the supply chain situation.      But it‚Äôs unclear at this stage how soon production can begin as Wu would need to persuade technical staff with knowledge of handling the integrated circuit process to come over to his side. Most of them had been working closely with Zhan, the person added.    AntMiner trademark    Public records show that an effective AntMiner trademark has at least been registered in mainland China and Hong Kong, both filed and owned by Bitmain‚Äôs Singapore entity called Bitmaintech Pte.      Intriguingly, the same Singapore entity filed a new application for a trademark named ‚ÄúBitmain Antrack‚Äù on June 5, two days after Zhan‚Äôs return. But product details relating to this trademark aren‚Äôt clear at this stage.      Bitmaintech Pte is in parallel with Bitmain Technologies Limited, which is registered in Hong Kong. The two are both direct subsidiaries of BitMain Technologies Holding, the ultimate parent holding group incorporated in the Cayman Islands that controls all Bitmain entities.      Read more: How Was It Possible for Bitmain to Oust Its Largest Shareholder Overnight?      Zhan owns 36% of the holding group while Wu owns 20%. The Hong Kong entity further owns Beijing Bitmain as well as Beijing Guiyuan Dalu. Currently, Zhan‚Äôs side controls Beijing Bitmain and its Shenzhen factory Century Cloud Core while Wu controls Guiyuan Dalu with the new supply chain subsidiary.      But as of July 2, a corporate filing of Bitmain Technologies Limited with the Hong Kong government shows that Wu was still the sole executive director at the Hong Kong entity‚Äôs board.      The two sides have an ongoing legal battle in the Cayman Islands. The legal decision could mark an end to their internal fight as it will rule on whether Zhan still has the dominant voting power over all issues at Bitmain‚Äôs parent holding group.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BTC | MINING | REGULATION | FORKS,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/20/power-struggle-inside-bitmain-hard-forks-bitcoin-miner-production,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f399b8be91391a041f3ca37036801b351b91313-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wash Trading Canada-based crypto trading platform Coinsquare has been accused by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) of¬†inflating its trading volumes¬†in an illegal practice called wash trading. In a Statement of Allegations from the OSC, filed last Thursday, the regulator alleges Coinsquare‚Äôs executives directed staff to wash trade as much as 90% of the platform‚Äôs reported volume between July 2018 and December 2019. The alleged misconduct occurred while Coinsquare was applying to the OSC to register a subsidiary, Coinsquare Capital Markets.      Crypto Cards Mastercard is expanding its cryptocurrency program by granting Wirex, a crypto payment business, principal membership status. This status makes Wirex the¬†first native crypto company to be able to directly issue payment cards¬†to its customers.

Alex Manson, the head of SC Ventures, said as many as 20 institutions have expressed interest in the custodial solution. He added, institutional adoption has been hindered by a lack of proper custodial offerings. Initially, SC Ventures had been looking at creating a market service, but realized it had to go a couple of steps back as many wouldn‚Äôt touch the digital asset space ‚Äúwith a flagpole‚Äù until they had ready access to an institutional-grade storage solution.      Promo Oversight The U.K. government is looking to¬†increase oversight into cryptocurrency promotions¬†in order to protect investors.

John Glen, the City Minister responsible for the U.K.'s financial services sector, said any firm looking to approve the financial promotions from unauthorized firms would first need to have the consent of the Financial Conduct Authority. He added the proposals would bring crypto product promotions up to the same levels as those for other asset-classes.    Quick bites  A Welsh author memorializes the¬†ICO bubble in novel¬†form  Wanted Wirecard executive is thought to be¬†sheltered by Russia‚Äôs Secret Service  Third Centra Tech founder¬†pleaded guilty to ICO fraud  Balaji proposed a decentralized plan to exit Twitter (Decrypt)  $1.6 billion was invested in institutional-focused crypto custody services (The Block)  The big story    Elon Musk‚Äôs OpenAI opened its third-generation language processing model to private beta, and crypto is aflutter with prognostications. GPT-3, short for Generative Pre-training Transformer, is a new AI-driven tool that revolutionizes how computers process and produce language.      ‚ÄúWhen properly primed by a human, it can write creative fiction; it can generate functioning code; it can compose thoughtful business memos; and much more. Its possible use cases are limited only by our imaginations,‚Äù¬†Forbes¬†reports.      Fed with nearly all the text available on the internet (roughly 175 billion parameters, or two orders of magnitude larger than its predecessor) GPT-3 can take any chuck of language a human gives it and run wild. It‚Äôs the one of the¬†most advanced machine-learning language models to date.      Manuel Araoz, Zeppelin Solutions CTO, already used it to write a¬†746-word blog¬†about a fake experiment looking at how GPT-3 can be used to deceive Bitcointalk forum members,¬†Decrypt¬†reports. This meta-blog demonstrates how language generators could be employed to create fake news and misinformation.      Araoz wonders whether GPT-3 will be ‚Äúthe biggest thing since bitcoin.‚Äù Citing its raw processing power, and Turing Test-passing blogs and tweets, it‚Äôs likely this technical edge will have a profound effect on how we judge content ‚Äì once it's released to the wild world wide web.      There‚Äôs plenty to suggest this tool will deepen the skepticism of online content, but Gwern, a pseudonymous researcher in crypto, has already used it to find beauty.      ‚ÄúGPT-3‚Äôs samples are not just close to human level: they are creative, witty, deep, meta, and often beautiful. They demonstrate an ability to handle abstractions, like style parodies, I have not seen in GPT-2 at all,‚Äù¬†he writes,¬†after testing it for a week. ‚ÄúChatting with GPT-3 feels uncannily like chatting with a human.‚Äù      Other early testers have their doubts. Delian Asparouhov, a Principal at Founders Fund, cautioned not to ‚Äúget too excited, this isn‚Äôt some sort of general AI, and the machine doesn‚Äôt really have a way of understanding if what it is outputting is true or not.‚Äù      While GPT-3 can predict language and finish a human being‚Äôs¬†sentences, paragraphs, essays,¬†it lacks internal understanding of language. It cannot reason. It cannot create. It can only mimic.      Whether that‚Äôs enough to match the revolutionary potential of a self-sovereign financial system is an open question. But it seems like the genie is out of the bottle in both instances.    Market intel    Futures: Bleak Trading activity in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has¬†cooled notably as the leading cryptocurrency languishes¬†in the price doldrums.

HM Treasury said Monday it was looking to clamp down on ""misleading and inadequate promotions"" that endangered retail investors.  Brought forward by John Glen, the City Minister responsible for the U.K.'s financial services sector, the proposals, published Monday, call for companies to pass through a ""regulatory gateway"" before being approved to promote cryptocurrency products.  This follows a 2018 report from the government's ""Cryptoassets Taskforce,"" which said misleading advertisements and promotions for cryptocurrency products was a key investor protection issue.  Under the proposals, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) would become the body responsible for overseeing digital asset promotions.  Any firm looking to approve the financial promotions from unauthorized firms would first need to have the consent of the FCA.  In a statement, Glen said existing regulation had failed to keep up with the expanding number of products coming to market.  He added the proposals would bring crypto product promotions up to the same levels as those for other asset-classes.  The proposals are currently in the consultation phase, which will continue until Oct. 25.

The cryptocurrency will be issued in collaboration with Recruit Group, a major Japanese holding firm that operates restaurant-finding service Hot Pepper Gourmet and many more.  The news was revealed by the company's president, Hironori Kamezawa, in an interview with Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun last week.  The digital currency will be initially utilized in a smartphone payment app for member companies listed on Recruit's website, as per the report.  Recruit has around 1 million member stores, according to its own figures.  The firm is the parent company of job-seekers' site Indeed and employer review site Glassdoor.  Kamezawa said while there could be delays, it may be a good time to launch the digital currency in light of the coronavirus pandemic.  While only Recruit members will be allowed to participate initially, Kamezawa said the initiative could one day be used more widely by non-Recruit site member stores, too.  In December 2019, MUFG downplayed reports of a digital currency launch, saying that while it had entered into a joint venture agreement with Recruit, ‚Äúno other decision‚Äù had been made at the time.  MUFG is the world's fifth largest bank and second largest bank holding company, according to Wikipedia.

It Depends Who You Ask,"Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.      Is crypto fintech?      This comes across as a fairly benign question to most people. If fintech is simply a term describing a range of financial technologies, and crypto is a financial technology, among other things, then surely crypto is fintech‚Ä¶ Right?      When I posed the question to a few of my favorite crypto discussion forums across Telegram and Whatsapp, it clearly hit a nerve. The responses ranged from the philosophical:    Fintech is a sector, an industry that regroups a collection of businesses, startups, applications.Crypto is a discipline: science, philosophy and of course a community.¬†I will give an example: collectibles and crypto art are part of ""crypto"" but I don't believe they fit in ""fintech."" [F]intech is finance + technology.Crypto technology can be used to disrupt finance.    To the structural:    literally yes, culturally no. there is a subset of crypto which is fintech, but not all crypto is fintech. it's a venn diagram with a huge overlap, but neither is full inside the other. plenty of non-financial crypto and plenty of non-crypto fintech. and culturally they are way different.I'm kind of sick of fintech tbh. They wear t shirts but secretly we know they're suits    To the categorical:    Is bitcoin financial technology? I would say it's the only true financial innovation tackling the core of all finance, which is money itself. Most of ""fintech"" is lipstick on a pig. There's no real tech most of the time. And all centralized.¬†Bitcoin is the first real NEW financial technology since...i dunno, since double entry bookkeeping? And from bitcoin, the pandora's box was opened for everything else. ... It will alter society in ways we can‚Äôt even imagine just yet. A payment app by a bank won‚Äôt do that. Hehe    Based on these passionate declarations, it would seem that those who live and breathe crypto vehemently reject the fintech label. They view fintech as a mere iteration on the incumbent rails of traditional finance, while crypto is building something inherently transformational, coming from a fundamentally different place in terms of culture, identity and motivation.      Apolline Blandin, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Lead at the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF), in the U.K., believes that a crypto-asset perfectly fits its definition of alternative finance as a monetary system emerging outside the traditional one. ‚ÄúMore importantly, it is aligned with our mission to unearth data about emerging industries,‚Äù said Blandin.    They view fintech as a mere iteration on the incumbent rails of traditional finance, while crypto is building something inherently transformational.    CCAF, a research center at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, was set up in 2015 to provide accessible fintech market insights to inform decision-making by policy makers, regulators and industry. In 2016, crypto and blockchain were added to its agenda.      Right now, CCAF is undertaking a study to understand how COVID-19 has impacted the global fintech landscape. Partnered with the World Bank Group and World Economic Forum, fintechs of all shapes and sizes are being asked to fill out a survey by 31 July 2020. It only takes 30 minutes to complete and is available in 10 languages, but some crypto companies won‚Äôt even click on the link because they don‚Äôt identify as fintech.      The word fintech has become about as impactful as other overworked, misused words like disruption and innovation. So, in an effort to establish a lexicon that better portrays the true breadth, depth and complexity of the ecosystem, CCAF developed a taxonomy guide (see chart) that identifies 15 verticals, 11 subsets and 102 possible categories of financial services outside the traditional sector. These include digital lending and capital raising, mobile payments and remittance, ""WealthTech,"" ""InsureTech"" and ""RegTech,"" and of course, crypto and blockchain.      ‚ÄúI think a lot of people hear the buzzword and silo it,‚Äù said Tania Ziegler, CCAF‚Äôs Lead in Global Alternative Finance Benchmarking, about the term crypto. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôve got crypto asset exchanges, market provisioning, digital custody and consensus services ‚Äì so that‚Äôs effectively four different overarching verticles where a crypto could live.‚Äù      Even so, some in crypto are about as keen on being dumped in the fintech bucket as they are about dealing with increasing regulatory scrutiny. Crypto OGs tend to dislike this kind of encroachment because they see it as antithetical to the purpose of Bitcoin ‚Äì that is, to provide an electronic cash system based on privacy and disintermediation.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - In Fintech, Fiat and Crypto Worlds Are Converging      Ziegler recalls that digital lending platforms felt similarly irrelevant to fintech when they burst onto the scene around 2010. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs natural, as the space is evolving, to have these existential questions, especially where there are use cases that are not purely financial,‚Äù she said.      In recent years, crypto has attracted a level of mainstream attention that means the authorities can‚Äôt ignore it (especially after the 2017 run up, and less favorably, with last week‚Äôs big Twitter hack). This has pros and cons. Being recognised as a valid entity comes with certain privileges for crypto companies, such as being able to open a bank account. But it also comes with regulatory responsibilities.      And when the regulators are doing their planning for 2021, they‚Äôll be referencing aggregated sources of industry data like CCAF‚Äôs COVID-19 study (the report is due in September). Under these circumstances, as much as crypto might insist upon its uniqueness, if it refuses to participate under the common fintech banner, it risks being overlooked by the kind of decision makers who are far less emotionally invested in the definition.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/20/is-crypto-fintech-it-depends-who-you-ask,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a71eb983fe7408f2734fbe6431fc5867934974e-1700x1124.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432335,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNC4Vh,1595250009,Standard Chartered to Launch Institutional Crypto Custody Solution,"Standard Chartered's venture and innovation arm has been working on a crypto custody offering for the institutional market and the first pilot could launch later this year.      Alex Manson, the head of SC Ventures, confirmed to CoinDesk Monday the firm is building what he claimed would become one of the most secure crypto custody solutions on the market.      Details remain thin on the ground, but Manson said that as many as 20 institutions have expressed interest in the custodial solution. Although it will be based in the U.K., it will be open to clients from around the world. As well as assets such as bitcoin, SC Ventures is looking at also making the solution suitable for security tokens.      According to Manson, institutional adoption has been hindered by a lack of proper custodial offerings. Initially, SC Ventures had been looking at creating a market service, but realized it had to go a couple of steps back as many wouldn't touch the digital asset space ""with a flagpole"" until they had ready access to an institutional-grade storage solution.      Custodial offerings currently on the market, Manson said, don't have the proper security required for clients to store millions of dollars in digital assets. Many also lack function segregation, meaning the custody business isn't separated from other ventures, he added. By providing the fundamental market infrastructure, Manson said SC Ventures saw an opportunity to kick-start the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.      ""If digital assets more broadly are here to stay as an asset class, then you will need the infrastructure to keep them safe,"" Manson said.      See also: Standard Chartered Claims First Yuan-Based Letter of Credit Issued on a Blockchain      Based in Singapore, SC Ventures is the innovations platform for British bank Standard Chartered. Part of its role is to help create new businesses and revenue streams for the wider banking group. As well as the custody solution, the venture arm is working on bringing another nine (non-crypto-related) projects to market.      Just last week, SC Ventures participated in the oversubscribed Series A for market infrastructure provider, Metaco. At the time, Manson said in a statement the investment would complement its own custodial initiative, which has not yet been publicly named. Talking to CoinDesk, he elaborated, saying Metaco would be one of the key technology providers.      Standard Chartered has long expressed an interest in crypto custodial solutions. Margaret Harwood-Jones, the bank's global head of securities services, told trade publication Global Custodian that it was something the group was investigating in November 2018.

More than $1 billion of new bitcoin-mining computers will be purchased for North American bitcoin mining in the next two years, several people familiar with the industry told CoinDesk. That‚Äôs about five times the publicly traded mining-equipment maker Canaan‚Äôs revenue for all of 2019.      You‚Äôre reading¬†First Mover, CoinDesk‚Äôs daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don‚Äôt have to. You can¬†subscribe here.      ‚ÄúNorth America is not going to completely take over mining, but there is going to be growth,‚Äù Trevor Smyth, managing partner of San Francisco-based Arctos Capital, said in a phone interview. In April, Arctos funded a $1 million sale-and-leaseback transaction for Blockware Mining, a bitcoin mining and rig-hosting company,¬†according to a press release at the time.      The trend shows that entrepreneurs and investors are undaunted by the recent doldrums in the bitcoin market, where for the past month prices have remained stuck ‚Äì almost uncannily quiet for the historically volatile cryptocurrency ‚Äì in a range between roughly $9,000 and $10,000. It‚Äôs been a big disappointment for many bitcoin bulls, after a slew of predictions earlier this year that the May‚Äôs once-every-four-years ‚Äúhalving‚Äù might send prices to $90,000 or higher.      But the availability of financing for upgrades could put pressure on industry players to keep investing in new equipment, perpetuating the hardware arms race even without fresh price signals. It‚Äôs sort of like purchasing a new smartphone every year just to avoid falling behind the cutting edge.      Dave Perrill, CEO of Compute North, a Minnesota-based data center operator that offers hosting services for bitcoin miners, estimates that at least 2 million new-generation mining rigs will be produced during the current hardware cycle, with at least 400,000 units landing in North America.      ‚ÄúWe believe that upwards of 20% of the new equipment will be operated there,‚Äù Perrill said.      Blockfills, a Chicago-based cryptocurrency market maker, says it will provide equipment financing for North American bitcoin miners who can obtain power-purchase agreements and secure base facilities in the U.S. or Canada.      ‚ÄúWe expect to fund approximately $250 million ourselves in the next 12 months,‚Äù Neil Van Huis, director of sales and institutional trading at Blockfills, told First Mover in a phone interview.      Smyth, of Arctos Capital, said his firm is financing North American bitcoin mining equipment purchases in the range of $1 million to $2 million per deal.      Investors looking to gain a yield in a low-interest economic environment are investing in bitcoin mining ‚Äì more so than ever before, Smyth said. Lenders can earn an attractive return from the interest charged in the deals, known as commercial leasing, he said.      ‚ÄúWe raise capital through multiple sources,‚Äù Smyth said. ‚ÄúUltimately they find our business is able to generate attractive risk-adjusted yields that can help diversify their investment portfolios.‚Äù      The investment proposition has become even more enticing since the coronavirus-induced economic crisis led to a collapse in yields on everything from U.S. Treasury bonds to mortgages. Smyth says his investors are seeing ‚Äúnon-correlated, steady returns.‚Äù      Arctos gets debt capital from institutions like banks and securitization partners. There is also a private Regulation D fund, which has exemption from Securities and Exchange Commission registration for small firms like Arctos to raise capital, he said.      The investment push could also give North America a bigger share of the bitcoin mining industry, historically dominated by Chinese operators, many of them with ready access to cheap electricity from hydropower plants. Currently, China has 65% of the geographical mining market share.      Smyth pointed to the entry into the bitcoin market of high-profile investors like¬†Paul Tudor Jones III¬†as a sign that more institutional capital is coming to crypto, despite the lack of price action.      The debt financing deals may be easier for many investors to understand than, say, taking a flyer on bitcoin perpetual derivatives on a Seychelles-based exchange.      ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs certainly going to be hedge funds coming in and directly holding bitcoin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I actually see more opportunity for the bitcoin industry to attract institutional investors through structured debt products such as lease financing.‚Äù      Smyth says he sees a continuation of the ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest‚Äù dynamic in the industry, where only the most efficient operators can keep up with the Bitcoin blockchain‚Äôs ever-increasing computational power, known as the hash rate.      The halving, which occurred on May 12, was the latest such milestone for the bitcoin blockchain, as programmed into the network‚Äôs 11-year-old code. The number of bitcoin produced as the reward for mining a new data block ‚Äì roughly every 10 minutes ‚Äì dropped to 6.25 from 12.5.      Ahead of the event, miners scrambled to upgrade their equipment to avoid becoming obsolete. And the amount of power used in bitcoin mining subsequently declined 43% in late May, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, in what might be an indication of the efficiency gains from the new generation of machines.      The hashrate is currently around 120 million terahashes per second, close to record highs. And that has caused a self-regulating mechanism coded into the Bitcoin blockchain, a factor known as ‚Äúmining difficulty,‚Äù to¬†hit new highs¬†as new, more efficient machines are put into service.      It‚Äôs another force pushing miners to continue upgrading. More record difficulty highs are likely to accompany the deployment of new machines like the Bitmain S19 Pro and MicroBT M30S++, unveiled earlier this year.      ‚ÄúMiners that are more efficient and stay online actually earn more bitcoin,‚Äù Smyth said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs self-adjusting.‚Äù    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,160 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,235 | 24-Hr Low: $9,119      Trend:¬†Bitcoin is again sidelined near $9,160, having witnessed a trading range of just $325 last week ‚Äì the lowest since the last week of March 2019.      As a result, bitcoin‚Äôs Bollinger bands, volatility indicators placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average, are now even more compressed than they were last week. ‚ÄúSuch behavior could be considered a sign that a period of high volatility is just around the corner,‚Äù said Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at the cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO.      Indeed a prolonged period of low-volatility trading often ends up with a big move in either direction. The analyst community has been calling a spike in volatility for more than two weeks now. So far, however, both buyers and sellers have refrained from making big bets on the cryptocurrency, leaving prices directionless above $9,000.      Should the long-held psychological support of $9,000 cave in, stronger chart-driven selling pressure may likely emerge, pushing the cryptocurrency down to the 50-week moving average at $8,550.      Alternatively, a move above $9,480 would invalidate a bearish lower high created on July 8 and expose resistance at $9,800 (June 22 high) and $10,000.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Daniel Cawrey, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/20/first-mover-bitcoin-miners-find-upgrade-financing-aplenty-even-as-prices-languish,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d01c0ca67c866425f406a48d1cf1988aed122aad-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Huobi, FTX, Bitfinex, Binance, Bybit, and Bakkt, has also tanked over the past two months.      As of Sunday, aggregate daily volume was just $4.65 billion, down 87% from the $36 billion observed on May 11.      ‚ÄúContinued range trading and an inability to confidently break above $10,000 has led investors to allocate capital into other segments of the crypto market,‚Äù said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      Also read: DeFi Driving Chainlink‚Äôs Link Token to Record Highs      Indeed, alternative cryptocurrencies like the oracle network Chainlink‚Äôs LINK token, Stellar's XLM and tokens associated with the decentralized finance (DeFi) space like Compound's LEND have received greater attention from the investor community over the past week or two.      Tokens like LINK and XLM have witnessed a surge in trading volumes in the spot market this month, while bitcoin‚Äôs volume in both the spot market and futures market has declined.      LINK‚Äôs trading volume on Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange, has increased by 67%, while XLM‚Äôs volume has jumped by nearly 40% to new record highs. Meanwhile, bitcoin trading has diminished for the third straight month.      ‚ÄúWith the hype around the DeFi, this trend may continue for the short-term,‚Äù Dibb said in a direct chat with CoinDesk.    CME open interest down too    Open interest, or open positions in futures, listed on the CME (which is considered synonymous with institutional participation) has also declined along with the daily trading volume.¬†As of Friday, $364 million worth of positions were open on the CME ‚Äì down 31% from the high of $532 million observed on May 19.      However, aggregate or global open interest remains elevated near $4 billion, the highest level since early March.      Derivative analysts consider the combination of declining trading volume and elevated open interest as a sign of investors holding on to their positions. In such cases, markets usually extend the preceding move, meaning bitcoin could break above $10,000 in the near-term, marking a continuation of the uptrend from the March low of $3,867.

As reported by Reuters on Monday, the central bank is warming up to the possibility of a digital yen, given the recent rise in interest among other central banks.  While details are limited, the new team will likely follow up on the BOJ‚Äôs 2019 research into central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as well as the additional research it has been conducting with other central banks since January.  The team will form part of the central bank‚Äôs payment and settlement department.  Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya previously said that it would be hard for central banks to make negative interest rate policies more effective through the issuance of their own digital currencies.  He reasoned that it would force individuals and businesses to pay to hold a CBDC and, as such, would motivate people not to use the digital form of money.  But the BOJ is shifting its thinking on the technology as regional rival China's digital currency enters testing with commercial entities.

42432337,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNC4Zh,1595235411,Canada Crypto Exchange Coinsquare Accused of Wash Trading by Watchdog,"Canadian crypto trading platform Coinsquare has been accused by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) of inflating its trading volumes in an illegal practice called wash trading.    In a Statement of Allegations from the OSC, filed last Thursday, the regulator alleges Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond, founder Virgile Rostand and executive Felix Mazer knowingly manipulated markets via fake trading volumes and ‚Äúauthorized, permitted or acquiesced in this conduct‚Äù by the firm's staff.  Staff were directed by Diamond to engage in wash trading activity, while Rostand designed and implemented the code to carry out the activity, the statement alleges.  Mazer was Coinsquare‚Äôs chief compliance officer (CCO) from May 2018 until June 2020, but he ‚Äúfailed to take steps that a reasonable CCO would have taken,‚Äù the commission said.  The regulator said fake trades represented 90% of Coinsquare's reported volume between July 2018 and December 2019.  It also alleges that between July 17, 2018, and December 4, 2019, approximately 840,000 wash trades were conducted on the platform with an aggregate value of around 590,000 bitcoin (worth over $5.4 billion at press time).  When a Coinsquare whistleblower repeatedly sought to expose the illicit activities, the company carried out reprisals against them, the OSC claims.  The alleged misconduct also occurred while Coinsquare was applying to the OSC to register a subsidiary, Coinsquare Capital Markets Ltd. In the process, the platform concealed these activities from OSC staff.  The OSC statement came after a report by Motherboard, Vice Magazine's tech section, last month saying Coinsquare had engaged in wash trading.  It based the report on leaked emails, Slack messages and other sources of information.  The OSC Secretary will now hold a hearing to determine whether it is in the public interest to approve a settlement agreement between the OSC and Coinsquare.  The hearing will be held on July 21, 2020, at 19:30 UTC.

According to a report in German new source Handelsblatt on Sunday, Jan Marsalek is now staying in a property in the west of Moscow under the supervision of Russia's largest secret service, the military-controlled GRU.  Handelsblatt¬†cited judges, diplomats and business people as the source of the information.

Another German news source, Der Spiegel, also reported over the weekend that Marsalek had originally flown to Belarus.  Tense political relations between Russia and Belarus' leader reportedly meant the GRU felt it would be better to bring the fugitive to Russia.

It's a plum assignment for New York-based Paxos, which last week launched Paxos Crypto Brokerage and announced its first customer in Revolut US, the American division of the U.K.-based fintech firm that offers bitcoin trading. A formal announcement of the PayPal relationship could come as soon as this week, one source said.      The offering would make PayPal one of the most prominent mainstream companies to offer cryptocurrency purchases, joining fellow publicly traded payments provider Square and unicorn stock brokerage Robinhood.      It is not clear exactly which cryptocurrencies PayPal intends to offer. Paxos declined to comment for this story. PayPal did not return requests for comment by press time. CoinDesk broke the news of PayPal‚Äôs crypto plans on June 22.      Read more: PayPal, Venmo to Roll Out Crypto Buying and Selling: Sources      CoinDesk reported then that PayPal and its Venmo subsidiary would be bringing direct buying and selling of crypto to some portion of the company's 325 million users.      The new Paxos brokerage, an API-based solution for making crypto services easy for businesses to roll out, allows cryptocurrency buying, selling, holding and sending capabilities while handling all regulatory compliance aspects. Paxos, which holds a New York state trust charter, is a qualified custodian, legally permitted to hold gold and digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) on institutional investors' behalf.      San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which has a longstanding relationship with PayPal, was said to be in line to provide some kind of white-labeled crypto offering. European exchange Bitstamp (which provides crypto liquidity to Revolut in the U.K.) was also mentioned as a contender at the time. Both companies declined to comment for this story.    PayPal playing catch-up    The crypto wings of traditional fintech apps are steadily growing in stature.      Crypto is steadily moving from being a pseudo-asset with fringe appeal to becoming a must-have for fintech and challenger-bank apps looking to build revenue and customers.      In addition to Revolut entering the U.S. market with crypto trading, Square, the payments unicorn launched by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has seen its bitcoin trading revenues grow. Square rolled out bitcoin purchases in its Cash App in mid-2018 and reported $306 million in bitcoin revenue in its most recent earnings report.
