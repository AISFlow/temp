Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-rescues-usa-trumpusa-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-bonk-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37309097,https://thecoinrise.com/binance-introduces-spot-trading-of-acx-and-orca-pairs/,1733528121,Binance Introduces Spot Trading of ACX And ORCA Pairs,"Top digital asset service provider Binance has announced its intention to list Across Protocol (ACX) and Orca (ORCA). As is the tradition with the cryptocurrency exchange, a seed tag will be attached to the listing. For context, tokens with seed tags may have a different product or user base than established digital assets. Hence, Binance tries to notify its users of such tokens’ high volatility and potential trading risks. Users must pass a risk-awareness quiz every 90 days to continue trading ACX and ORCA. Also, they must periodically reaffirm their agreement with Binance’s Terms of Use. Price of ACX And ORCA Spikes by 3 Digits According to the announcement, ACX and ORCA trading will commence today, December 6, at 13:00 UTC with the spot trading pairs ACX/USDT and ORCA/USDT. A deposit for both tokens is now available in preparation for the trading session. Withdrawals will be open on December 7, 2024. The listing news has triggered some price gain for the tokens and the broader crypto market rebound . At the time of this writing, ACX had recorded a 106.84% increase in price and traded at $1.24. Its trading volume soared past $182 million and is 3,547.45% higher, at $149.2 million. Similarly, ORCA’s price has hit $8.78, corresponding with a 124.27% increase in the last 24 hours per CoinMarketCap data. Its trading volume is 2467.45% higher than its previous level. Understanding Across Protocol And Its Operations Across Protocol is an Ethereum-based optimistic insured bridge allowing seamless token transfers between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks. It utilizes a decentralized network of relayers that fund user deposits. Liquidity providers secure this in a single pool on Ethereum. Refunds are processed using UMA’s Optimistic Oracle. The aim is to balance cost efficiency, security, and user transaction speed. ORCA And its Benefits to Developers ORCA is a decentralized exchange (DEX) native to the Solana blockchain. Its core focus is on efficient token swaps within the ecosystem. It is more of a general-purpose Automated Market Maker (AMM) that is a versatile developer tool. With Orca, users can swap assets, provide liquidity, and earn yield through a user-friendly interface. In like manner, developers’ projects can integrate Orca’s swapping, farming, and on-chain data capabilities directly into their decentralized applications.

37309096,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-polygon-bandwagon-qubetics-is-your-next-big-investment/,1733527812,Missed the Polygon Bandwagon? Qubetics Is Your Next Big Investment,"The crypto market never sleeps, and neither does the FOMO it generates. Over the past few years, we’ve watched coins like Polygon (MATIC) soar, turning early adopters into overnight millionaires. If you didn’t hop on the MATIC train back in 2020, you’re not alone—it feels like most of us missed that bus. But here’s the good news: missing out on Polygon might just be your best blessing in disguise. Why? Because a new opportunity has arrived that’s making even the most seasoned investors sit up and pay attention. Meet Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary crypto project that’s shaking up the space with its bold vision for real-world asset tokenisation. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy, Qubetics is not just an option—it’s the opportunity of the season. Qubetics ($TICS): Where Web3 Meets the Real World If you’ve been in the crypto game for a while, you’ve probably heard plenty of projects making big claims about “bridging the gap” between blockchain and the real world. Most of them fall short, but Qubetics is different. It’s not just building a bridge—it’s redefining what’s possible by tokenising real-world assets. So, what exactly does that mean? At its core, Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator that’s focused on real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT). It’s taking tangible, physical assets like real estate, luxury cars, and even high-value collectibles and turning them into digital tokens. This isn’t just some abstract concept—it’s a game-changing solution that’s unlocking liquidity for individuals and businesses. Imagine this: You’re a property owner who needs quick cash but doesn’t want to sell your entire building. With Qubetics, you can tokenise a portion of your property, sell fractional ownership, and raise capital faster than a bank loan. Or let’s say you’re an art collector with a multi-million-dollar masterpiece. Instead of selling the entire painting, you could sell digital ownership fractions to buyers across the globe. That’s the kind of flexibility Qubetics brings to the table. And it’s not just for the ultra-wealthy. Small business owners can use Qubetics to unlock value from their physical assets, while individuals can invest in tokenised assets that were once out of reach. Whether you’re an entrepreneur looking to expand or a young professional wanting to diversify your portfolio, Qubetics is creating a world where you don’t need to be a millionaire to play the big leagues. Now, let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in its 11th presale stage, and the buzz is unreal. Over 275 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $4.6 million from 6,800+ holders. And those who jumped in early? They’re already seeing gains. $TICS tokens were priced at $0.025 in the 10th stage, and now they’re at $0.0282—a solid 10% increase. Analysts predict the token could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a whopping 776% ROI. But that’s just the start. Post-launch, $TICS could reach $1, $5, or even $15, turning modest investments into small fortunes. Think about it: if you invest $10,000 at today’s price of $0.0282, you’d snag 354,609 $TICS tokens. At $1, your investment grows to $354,609. And at $15? You’re looking at a life-changing $5.3 million. That’s not just a win—that’s legendary. Why did Qubetics make it to this list? Because it’s not just a token—it’s a tool for the future, solving real-world problems in a way no other project has managed to do. Polygon: The Layer-2 Powerhouse That Changed the Game Let’s switch gears and talk about Polygon. If you’ve been in crypto for any amount of time, you’ve probably heard about this Layer-2 scaling solution that’s made Ethereum’s clunky transaction fees and slow speeds a thing of the past. Polygon didn’t just improve Ethereum—it supercharged it. Back in the day, Ethereum’s high gas fees were driving users and developers away. Enter Polygon. With its ability to process thousands of transactions per second at a fraction of the cost, it became the go-to solution for developers building decentralised apps (dApps), NFT platforms, and DeFi protocols. It’s like the Robin Hood of crypto—taking from the inefficiencies of Ethereum and giving power back to the people. And the world noticed. Polygon has partnered with some of the biggest brands out there—think Starbucks, Adidas, Disney, and Reddit. These partnerships aren’t just PR stunts; they’re real-world use cases that cement Polygon’s place as a foundational piece of Web3 infrastructure. But here’s the thing: while Polygon has seen explosive growth, its days of life-changing ROI may be behind it. If you snagged MATIC back in 2020 when it was trading at under a penny, congratulations—you’re probably sitting on a fortune. Today, though, MATIC hovers around $0.85–$1. For new investors, it’s still a solid play, but the 10,000% gains? Those are in the rearview. Let’s break it down. A $10,000 investment in MATIC today might double or triple in value over time, but it’s unlikely to deliver the astronomical returns we’ve seen in the past. It’s a safer bet for those looking for stability, but for investors chasing the best crypto to buy for high-risk, high-reward gains, Polygon may not scratch that itch anymore. Why did Polygon make it to this list? Because it’s still a rock-solid project with a proven track record. It may not be the next moonshot, but it’s a cornerstone of the blockchain world. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now So, where does this leave us? If you’re looking for stability and long-term growth, Polygon remains a smart choice. But if you’re after a coin with the potential to deliver life-changing returns, Qubetics ($TICS) is where you should be focusing your attention. Qubetics isn’t just another token in a sea of thousands. It’s a visionary project that’s bringing blockchain into the real world in ways we’ve only dreamed of. With its focus on real-world asset tokenisation, Qubetics is unlocking new opportunities for businesses, investors, and everyday people alike. And the timing couldn’t be better. The presale is heating up, the price is still accessible, and the potential ROI is off the charts. Don’t wait until $TICS is trading at $1, $5, or $15 to realise you should’ve jumped in earlier. This is your chance to catch the next big wave before it’s gone. The best crypto to buy isn’t going to wait for you. Head over to Qubetics now and secure your slice of the future before the price climbs again. Don’t just watch the crypto market evolve—be a part of the revolution.

Its accompanying SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( NYSEARCA: SPY ) added 0.88% for the week. Friday’s session cemented the benchmark’s ( SP500 ) 57th record closing high in 2024, and a third-straight weekly win. The index, up +27% this year, also crossed above 6,100 for the first time on record. Another asset notched a milestone this week: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) vaulted above $100,000 for the first time. The cryptocurrency has shot up ~127% this year. “Froth [is] forming in crypto,” and in large-cap stocks, Bank of America Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett said Friday. He noted the S&P 500’s ( SP500 ) 5.3x price-to-book ratio has surpassed a March 2000 high – when the market was wrapped up in the dot-com frenzy. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) $2T valuation is around the size of the 11th largest economy in the world, Hartnett said in a note. The Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) also notched a record-high close on Friday, and while the Dow ( DJI ) slipped, the blue-chip gauge this week marked its first-ever finish above 45,000 points. Stocks found upside support this week from rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue chopping down interest rates at its December 17-18 meeting. Odds of a quarter-point rate cut climbed to 85% on Friday, a jump from 66% over the past week, according to the CME FedWatch tool . Rate-cut odds climbed further after the release of the November U.S. jobs report on Friday. Job additions of 227K exceeded the 211K consensus estimate. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from 4.1%, meeting forecasts. The “report emphasizes that the labor market remains strong and that policymakers at the Federal Reserve have room to work as we approach a soft landing,” Cory Stahle, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said. The Consumer Discretionary sector emerged as the S&P 500’s ( SP500 ) top-performing group this week. Tesla ( TSLA ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) are part of that group, and AI-related progress at the online retailer ( AMZN ) and a BofA price-target upgrade for the EV maker ( TSLA ) helped send their shares flying up +12% and +9%, respectively, for the week. Delving further into the weekly performance of S&P 500 ( SP500 ) sectors, three ended in positive territory, while eight fell. Following Consumer Discretionary at the top of the list was Communication Services. Energy was this week’s laggard.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/donalds-bitcoin-donbtc-memecoin-will-explode-over-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase Assets says it’s adding support for the meme asset Mog Coin ( MOG ), a cat-themed token that launched in July 2023. “MOG Coin is now live on http://coinbase.com and in the Coinbase iOS and Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.” News of the listing sent MOG flying as the meme asset went from low of $0.000002375 on December 5th to a peak of $0.000003418 the following day. It has since stabilized and is trading for $0.000003335 at time of writing, a 36% increase during the last 24 hours. Earlier this week, another animal-themed meme coin earned the support of Coinbase but met the opposite fate. On Monday, the crypto exchange announced that it is listing Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), a Solana ( SOL )-based, pygmy hippopotamus-themed meme token. Moo Deng – which means “bouncy pork” in Thai – first became an internet sensation when it was born at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand this summer. The animal went viral again after correctly “predicting” the 2024 US Presidential election in November. However, despite its internet fame, the meme asset did not perform well once earning support from Coinbase as it dipped from a peak of $0.596 on December 4th to a low of $0.448 about a day later, a 12% decrease. It has since stabilized and is trading for $0.468.

37308011,https://crypto.news/?p=14316976,1733526082,Exclusive: co-founder Friederike Ernst on building Gnosis and bringing cypherpunk ideals to real life,"In an exclusive interview with crypto.news, Friederike Ernst, co-founder of Gnosis, discusses the future of money and how the cypherpunk movement continues to impact crypto innovation. In the bustling crypto landscape, Friederike Ernst, co-founder and COO of Gnosis Pay and Gnosis Safe , has carved out a unique space for herself. A retired physicist with a penchant for building and cryptography, Ernst’s journey from academia to co-founding one of the most widely used decentralized payment platforms is a testament to her innovative spirit. Ernst’s fascination with cryptography began in childhood, sparked by a book gifted by her father: The Code Book (1999) by Simon Singh. “I was the 12-year-old kid who set up her own PGP server,” Ernst recounts. “No one else was using it, but I had a good time.” After completing her studies in physics and neuroscience in London and Berlin, Ernst embarked on a career in academia, conducting postdoctoral research at Columbia and Stanford before becoming a professor in Hamburg. It was in 2017 that Ernst decided to leave academia and co-found Gnosis, alongside the onchain wallet’s original co-founders Martin Köppelmann and Stefan George. Initially incubated within ConsenSys as a prediction market, Gnosis Pay and later Gnosis Safe emerged as a foundational pillar of Ethereum’s ecosystem. “We started with the goal of building a prediction market platform,” says Ernst. “Our conditional token framework became the backbone for projects like Polymarket.” Seeing the prediction market landscape as more daunting than the payment vertical, Gnosis eventually expanded its portfolio, creating tools and infrastructure critical to Web3. Gnosis Safe, the largest non-custodial smart wallet today manages over $100 billion in assets, while CowSwap, a decentralized exchange aggregator that matches buy and sell orders directly between users, is used by large and small investors alike to reduce fees and slippages. All of this is technology is led by creating safe guardrails for capital flow, the veritable architecture of crypto capital, of which Ernst has spent a considerable part of the last decade years thinking about. In recent years, Gnosis has focused on making blockchain technology more accessible to everyday users. Gnosis Pay, launched as a blockchain-native payment solution, integratea on-chain assets with real-world financial systems. In April of this year, Gnosis Chain hit over 200 million transactions , a milestone that also saw Gnosis record over 55% growth in transactions year-on-year. “One of the reasons we chose payments as a vertical is its simplicity compared to other sectors,” Ernst explained. “Payments are about balances that change according to well-understood rules.” Gnosis Pay integrates with existing financial rails such as SEPA and VISA, enabling users to spend cryptocurrencies in traditional settings. “If you walk into Aldi and say you only have USDC, they’re not going to accept it,” says Ernst. “Our goal is to make on-chain assets compatible with real-world situations.” Gnosis Pay works by taking a self custodial approach to wallets, allowing for EUR on the Gnosis Pay network that works as bridge between off chain visa transactions and on chain transactions on Gnosis Chain. However, Ernst also underscored the importance of user experience, criticizing the traditional crypto onboarding process as overly complex. “The 24-word seed phrase is terrible UX,” she asserts. “We’re leveraging cryptographic advancements like biometric logins and social recovery to make crypto as intuitive as PayPal or Gmail.” In addition, Gnosis Safe, launched in 2017, has become an indispensable tool for managing digital assets securely. Unlike traditional wallets, Gnosis Safe offers multi-signature functionality, allowing multiple parties to approve transactions. “Gnosis Safe is more than just a wallet; it’s a digital vault,” says Ernst. “It’s used by DAOs, institutions, and individuals who prioritize security and transparenc,” Multisig has become an indispensable tool for ensuring cryptographic safety. With integrations into decentralized finance ( DeFi ) and NFT ecosystems, Gnosis Safe has become a cornerstone of trust in Web3, safeguarding billions in value.

Launched in October 2020, Circles sparked a surge in grassroots adoption, with thousands across Europe forming trust connections through the network. In Berlin, Cafe Grundeinkommen accepted CRC for morning coffee, while farmers’ markets embraced Circles for weekly trade. An experiment in Bali where thousands used the system also worked well, but there were bugs. Circles faced challenges all too common among early technologies: transaction demands, group and community connections required improvement, and users needed simpler ways to integrate Circles with existing payment systems. In November, Circles 2.0 was launched at DevCon in Bangkok. Operating on Gnosis Chain, Circles 2.0 enables users to issue and exchange personalized currencies with their social network, adding features that will help Circles scale in users, groups and communities. “The idea is to create a grassroots financial system,” Ernst explains. “Circles emphasize trust and community, making UBI more sustainable and scalable.” By allowing for the creation of personal and group avatars and their currencies through the CRC token. Circles then deploys what it calls a pathfinder to find and locate the optimal path between trust connections, thereby concluding the transaction. Circles uses smart contracts based on ERC20 and ERC1155 multi-token standards for both personal avatars and group avatars, but it’s a system Ernst sees as empowering the next generation of economic actors to take economic agency. In the Circles ecosystem, a person receives 1 CRC every hour, with 24 CRC being given out in a single day. Circles undergo daily demurrage at a rate equivalent to 7% per year, and issuance for past days accounts for this demurrage, which Ernst says creates a fairer distribution over time. A flow of architecture for Circles 2.0 Protocol. Source: Gnosis “We call it the leaky memory effect,” Ernst said. “For example, things you did last week should count a lot, but things that your ancestors did 200 years ago, they should count for a lot less.” This means that within the Circles economy, “people who come later are still incentivized to join because old money gets deflated over time.” It’s an innovation that aims to empower local communities to launch complementary currencies, including organizations who may want to build internal economies, as members of a group can now mint a shared currency by locking their personal CRC as collateral in a group vault. Known as Group Circles, fungible and tradeable within the group, these can later be redeemed for any CRC in the vault, maintaining a stable supply while fostering community-driven economies. “Circles is a decentralized web of trust because you are immediately incentivized to remove all your untrustworthy connections, otherwise, they could stick you with their worthless Circles,” Ernst suggests. It is this vision of a more decentralized, autonomous, and economically equitable society that drives Ernst’s relentless dedication towards her ideas of what money is, and what it can be. An idea that is also increasingly within the crosshairs of European regulators, be it France’s recent decision to potentially tax unrealized Bitcoin gains , or the ongoing legal woes of Tornado Cash , the new frontiers of the economics of exchange remains in flux.

37307986,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658471,1733526000,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Price At $100,000 Is A ‘Dangerous Zone’, Predicts Massive Crash","The Bitcoin price recently achieved a monumental milestone, crossing the $100,000 threshold for the first time in its history. While the breakthrough is a significant achievement for the BTC price, it also raises the question of where it goes from here. The consensus among many analysts is of a continued bullish price action for Bitcoin. However, a crypto analyst on TradingView has issued a stark warning, labeling this price point as a “dangerous zone.” According to their technical outlook, reaching $100,000 could cause a massive correction in the Bitcoin price up to the $72,000 price level. Why $100,000 May Be A Turning Point For The Bitcoin Price After four failed attempts to breach the $100,000 mark, Bitcoin has finally broken through the psychological threshold and is now open to uncharted price territory. Although the Bitcoin price retraced below $100,000 in the hours after, many investors remain optimistic, viewing this retracement as a temporary setback and believing that Bitcoin’s journey above $100,000 is far from over. Related Reading: XRP Downtrend Is Only Temporary: Analyst Gives Reasons Why Price Is Headed For $3.2 The optimism, however, is met with a contrasting perspective from an analysis of the TradingView platform, which offers a more cautious and bearish outlook. The analyst highlights the $100,000 level as a “magnet” that has consistently drawn price activity over the past few weeks, serving as a critical zone of attraction and resistance. With this in mind, the analyst’s outlook is of bearish price action, essentially predicting a retest of $94,000. From here, the analyst expects the occurrence of a market structure break (MSB), which in turn would trigger a broader correction for the BTC price. Interestingly, the analyst predicted that breaking below the $94,000 price level would lead to a retest of $88,000. Should Bitcoin break below the $88,000 support, the analyst foresees further price declines that would drive the Bitcoin price toward an ideal target zone just above $72,200. Bullish Sentiment Outweighs Bearish Sentiment If the bearish scenario outlined by the analyst comes to pass, it could plunge the crypto market into another bear market, with other cryptocurrencies mirroring Bitcoin’s downward trajectory and erasing recent price gains. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Continues Trading Sideways But Bullish Pennant Says Get Ready For $1.30 However, this remains a prediction rather than an assessment of the current crypto market dynamics. Presently, the crypto market continues to bask in bullish sentiment, as evidenced by the Fear & Greed Index, which is currently at an extreme greed level of 81. A few analysts have suggested that Bitcoin’s price may still have room to climb, with some forecasting potential highs near $140,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at $98,350. Interestingly, the recent break above $100,000 led to a retest of $94,000 in the past 24 hours. However, the Bitcoin price rebounded from $94,000 instead of breaking below. Despite this rebound, the leading cryptocurrency might not be out of the woods yet.

37308082,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624100,1733525724,Elon Musk trolls Sam Altman following Sacks’ nomination as crypto and AI Czar,"There seems to be no love lost between Elon Musk and Sam Altman. The former allies turned rivals have played out their differences in the public, indicating the depth of their rift. The most recent case involves a tweet from the Open AI boss and the SpaceX chief executive’s response. Altman had taken to X to congratulate president-elect Donald Trump’s AI and crypto policy chief nominee, David Sacks. Little did he know that the post would earn him ridicule from the world’s richest man. Yet he precisely got that, with the outspoken X owner and Trump ally responding with an emoji laughing at his comment. Why is there a weariness about Musk’s growing political influence? Musk’s reaction comes hot on the heels of Altman’s recent comments at the New York Times-sponsored DealBook Summit. Then, the Open AI CEO had insisted that his erstwhile ally wouldn’t use his newfound clout around the Trump presidency to fight his competition. Altman said: I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon would hurt competitors and advantage his own businesses. ~Altman Musk, who was pivotal to President Trump’s re-election, is set to co-head the DOGE department with Vivek Ramaswamy. With his new mandate, many analysts suggest that the billionaire will be one of the men to watch in the Trump 2.0 administration. And with the nomination of Sacks, a close ally, it’s understandable that his business rivals would feel concerned. Musk has sued Open AI and its management Musk has had a testy relationship with Altman, with whom he co-founded OpenAI and other tech enthusiasts. Things came to a head in 2018 when conflicting interests saw him exiting the Chat Gpt-maker’s fold. Since then, he has been a vocal critic of the leading generative AI company and has sued it and its top brass for different reasons. For instance, he accuses the firm and its leadership of reneging on its founding principles. In court pleadings, Musk has portrayed OpenAI as a for-profit entity that went back on its non-profit foundation. He contends that in doing so, the company lied to its funders, the public, and regulators. A different suit claims that the Altman-led outfit is colluding with Microsoft, its primary financier, to prevent Musk’s xAI from making headway in the field. Altman and his co-accused deny the allegations, with the former expressing regret at the turn of events.

37307592,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624095,1733524531,Nvidia facing EU investigation over unfair business practices in promoting AI products,"Nvidia has a near-monopolistic stronghold on the AI chip market, holding about 84% of the total market share. The company’s valuation has grown exponentially since demand for generative AI peaked, and the world scrambles to deal with accelerated computing going mainstream — innovations that depend on Nvidia’s chips. However, the US chipmaker’s success has also led to increased regulatory scrutiny from regulators in the European Union, the United States, the UK, China, and South Korea. Nvidia’s chip market monopoly under scrutiny Recently, the European Commission sent out questionnaires that probed the existence of any commercial and technical links between Nvidia’s graphics processing unit (GPU) products. The EU competition enforcer is focusing on how Nvidia sells its GPU products to various customers and whether the contracts require them to buy networking equipment with GPU. Nvidia said : “We support customer choice and compete on merit across the board. Our products are best-in-class and able to stand on their own. We support open industry standards, enabling our partners and customers to use our products in a wide variety of configurations and system designs.” The watchdog is known to put out such questionnaires as part of fact-finding procedures, especially when it needs to substantiate initial concerns. If it finds Nvidia guilty of EU antitrust violations, the US chipmaker may face fines of up to 10% of its global annual turnover. Large corporations often face antitrust scrutiny Aside from Nvidia, other companies worldwide are under scrutiny because of the monopoly they seem to enjoy. Good examples are tech giants Apple and Meta. Both companies are currently involved in high-profile cases alleging unfair competition and antitrust, with some of them even having legal issues outside the United States. For example, in Apple’s DOJ antitrust case, the U.S. Department of Justice accused Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market. They allege the company limits cross-platform compatibility, restricts third-party app functionalities, and enforces the 30% “Apple Tax” for App Store transactions. The DOJ claims the listed practices hinder competition and pressure users to continue as patrons in Apple’s ecosystem. The case has similar elements to historical antitrust cases like U.S. v. Microsoft. The European Commission is also involved in legal proceedings against Apple for apparently not complying with the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA). The commission claims the company has been restricting alternative payment systems, blocking third-party app stores, and favoring its own services. The regulator believes these practices stifle competition in the European market. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Meta, formerly Facebook, enjoys a monopoly in social networking by acquiring potential competitors, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. As far as the lawsuit is concerned, the acquisitions got rid of any competition and limited consumer choice. More than 80 Spanish media companies also sued Meta on grounds of unfair competition in digital advertising. In their allegations, they stated that Meta used its dominant position to undermine competition in advertising markets between 2018 and 2023. A trial is now set for 2025. Even in free markets, regulators tend to step in when one company grows to suspicious levels within its industry. Nvidia has stepped into territories similar to Google, Meta, and Apple. If any of these companies are implicated in the lawsuits or investigations against them, there could be significant repercussions for their businesses and the industry they operate in. Not only can they face fines, there could be mandatory changes to their operations, including but not limited to forced sales, IP sharing, and regulation to prevent a future recurrence.

The regulator accuses them of running an unregistered securities exchange through the trading of BNB, Binance’s native token, and ten other cryptocurrencies. Details From the Filing The case relies on the Howey Test, a legal standard used to determine if something qualifies as a security. In simple terms, the test examines whether there was an investment of money, a common enterprise, and an expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others. The SEC claims the Binance case satisfies all three criteria. It says the exchange made users believe the value of their tokens depended on the success of Binance’s ecosystem, creating an expectation of profits. Its filing goes further by challenging Binance’s position that secondary market trades fall outside the scope of securities laws, asserting that such transactions are also governed by the Howey Test. The financial watchdog’s lawsuit, which was first filed earlier this year, faced criticism from Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who questioned some of its arguments. This led the SEC to amend its complaint. Binance and Zhao responded by lodging a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on November 4, arguing the regulator failed to provide enough evidence. However, in its newest court filing, the SEC continues to target BNB and ten other cryptocurrencies, labeling them securities. These include Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Axie Infinity (AXS), and COTI. The SEC also pushed back against criticism from the crypto industry, rejecting claims that it is overstepping its authority. In its filing, the agency stated, “The foretold vast and purported suffocating assertion of regulatory dominion over an entire industry has not occurred, but they complain about that, too.” Industry Experts Weigh In Meanwhile, not everyone agrees with the regulator’s methods. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s legal chief, criticized the agency for what he sees as inconsistent enforcement. In a tweet, he questioned why the SEC never classified Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) as securities. Ripple’s legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, also weighed in, criticizing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who is set to step down on January 20, 2025, with President-elect Donald Trump planning to replace him with Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate. Alderoty accused Gensler of rushing to file the latest 81-page brief before leaving office, describing it as recycling ‘failed arguments.’ Crypto attorney John Deaton added his voice, urging the SEC to reread the original Howey decision. He emphasized the ruling’s statement that it doesn’t matter whether an asset has intrinsic value or whether the enterprise is speculative.

37306916,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107780,1733523769,U.K. Government Holds Over $6 Billion in Bitcoin,"The U.K. Government has become one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin , with assets exceeding $6 billion , according to a report by Cointelegraph . These Bitcoin holdings stem from the 2021 seizure of funds tied to Zhimin Qian , a case that highlighted the growing intersection of cryptocurrency and legal enforcement. The Origins of the U.K.’s Bitcoin Reserve 1. Seizure from Zhimin Qian In 2021 , British authorities confiscated Bitcoin valued at billions of dollars from Zhimin Qian, who was involved in financial crimes. This marked one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in history, emphasizing the role of digital assets in illicit activities. 2. Current Valuation The holdings, now worth over $6 billion , underscore Bitcoin’s substantial appreciation in value since the time of the seizure. Implications of U.K. Government’s Bitcoin Holdings 1. A Strategic Reserve? While these Bitcoin holdings were initially the result of a legal action, their retention raises questions about whether the U.K. might consider cryptocurrency as part of its strategic financial reserves . Some speculate that the government could leverage these holdings to fund public initiatives or bolster economic stability. 2. Crypto Policy and Regulation The U.K.’s significant Bitcoin reserve may influence its cryptocurrency policies , potentially leading to more balanced regulations to foster innovation while maintaining oversight. What This Means for the Crypto Market 1. Institutional Legitimacy Governments holding Bitcoin enhance the asset’s credibility as a store of value and hedge against inflation . 2. Market Dynamics The possibility of the U.K. liquidating or utilizing its Bitcoin holdings could impact the cryptocurrency market, either stabilizing or introducing volatility. Historical Context: Seizures and Cryptocurrency 1. Notable Seizures Globally The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other governments have also conducted major cryptocurrency seizures. These incidents highlight the increasing prevalence of Bitcoin in both legitimate and illegitimate financial activities. 2. Bitcoin’s Value as a Seized Asset Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and potential for appreciation make it a unique type of confiscated property. Conclusion The U.K. Government’s $6 billion Bitcoin reserve underscores the growing role of cryptocurrency in global finance and law enforcement. While originally seized as part of a criminal investigation, these holdings could influence the U.K.’s approach to crypto regulation and its financial strategy.

Gay Musk (GAYMUSK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because GAYMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Gay Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Gay Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Gay Musk launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Gay Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Gay Musk by entering its contract address – AzwJdwbJA3YzCtot1SZ786obi9zqEQ46qxXxsevU9k4L – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like GAYMUSK.

Speaking during the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s (FSOC) annual meeting, Yellen flagged ongoing vulnerabilities tied to Bitcoin and commercial real estate, even as inflation eases and unemployment stays low. The council, established after the 2008 financial crash, focuses on monitoring systemic risks. This year, its attention has turned to emerging technological threats like artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. Yellen emphasized the need for a strong framework to govern stablecoins and other crypto assets, saying the council is pushing for federal laws to address identified risks. The growing regulatory pressure Yellen pointed to AI’s potential for misuse, particularly in areas like discriminatory lending. FSOC’s report warned that AI systems operating as “black boxes” could generate biased or inaccurate results, creating challenges for financial institutions and regulators alike. The council urged financial firms to improve their understanding of AI’s risks while embracing innovation responsibly. “The council continues to call for legislation to create a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers,” Yellen said. Despite AI’s promise of efficiency, the FSOC remains cautious. The report pointed out the risks of relying on technology for critical financial operations, especially when third-party service providers are involved. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities also ranked high on the council’s list of concerns, with Yellen calling for increased vigilance across the board. Commercial real estate and hedge fund leverage add to risks High-interest rates, a result of the Federal Reserve’s inflation-fighting policies, are squeezing the sector. FSOC has been monitoring Wall Street’s ability to handle this stress. Credit risks tied to commercial and residential real estate have been flagged as potential threats to financial stability. The council’s report also took a hard look at hedge funds. It highlighted the risks associated with leveraged trading, especially in the U.S. Treasury market. It recalled the March 2020 liquidity crisis, when leveraged hedge funds disrupted markets during a period of heightened economic uncertainty. FSOC warned that a similar scenario could unfold if fund liquidations impair market functioning. “A disorderly unwinding of leveraged funds’ cash-futures basis positions in the current economic environment could pose a risk to financial stability,” the report said. Two interagency working groups are reportedly exploring policy options to address these vulnerabilities. Yellen also touched on the challenges faced by the banking sector in 2023, a year marked by the collapse of three major financial institutions. While regulators acted quickly to prevent a broader crisis, the failures exposed weaknesses that still linger. FSOC noted that the response to these bank failures successfully prevented contagion, but Yellen believes vigilance remains critical.

Cardano (ADA), one of this quarter’s many surprises, crossed $1.2 and approached a breakout above $2. However, Solana (SOL), a DeFi giant, has been underwhelming but experts expect a bounce back soon. Amid rising sentiment, experts are bullish on DTX Exchange (DTX) . This new exchange-based cryptocurrency is at the crossroads between traditional and decentralized finance and has been tipped as a strong contender against BNB. DTX Exchange (DTX): A New BNB Contender? DTX Exchange (DTX) is a top ICO and arguably this quarter’s best presale. Over $9.3 million has been raised by the team, highlighting investor trust. Regarding its unique offering, it will be a hybrid trading platform that combines the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges. Wallet-based trading and non-custodial storage solutions will be some of its distinguishing features as it prepares to reshape the $3.2 billion global trading market. Additionally, it will be a one-stop platform to trade assets across stocks, ETFs, commodities, forex and cryptocurrencies. Given its intriguing blend of TradFi and DeFi through blockchain technology and an asset tokenization model, it is one of the new DeFi projects to watch. Meanwhile, a token is competitively priced at $0.12 in the sixth ICO round. It is projected to witness a 45x jump in value in the next 3 months, potentially outperforming Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL). Cardano (ADA) Targets a Breakout Above $2 Cardano (ADA), a top altcoin, basks in the spotlight following an impressive performance. Swinging high, the Cardano price exploded 30% in the weekly timeframe and over 250% on the weekly chart, trading above $1.2. The rising demand for the Cardano token can be linked to growing institutional appetite and retailers’ returns. Further upswings are anticipated, as highlighted by technical indicators like 20-VWMA and 9-HMA. At its current pace, Cardano (ADA) flipping $2 is a matter of time, inching toward a rally above the current ATH of $3.1 and price discovery. ADA_ONEVETCOTI, a crypto analyst, predicts an imminent rally to $3, followed by $5 and $10. Another crypto analyst, RealAllinCrypto, has $6 as their ADA price prediction for this bull cycle. Solana (SOL) Prepares for a Bounceback Solana (SOL), one of the best altcoins, faltered after registering a new peak price of $263 in late November. The Solana price tumbled 5% in the past seven days, although registering a 35% increase on the monthly chart. It retails above $220, which might be a huge discount in the coming days. Current price actions might be overwhelming but despite recent turbulence, it is on a bullish path. Technical indicators like the 100-SMA and 100-EMA are bullish signals hinting at future price gains, explaining why savvy investors have been doubling down. With plenty of room for growth at the current price, Solana (SOL) is among the best altcoins to invest in. This is echoed by Kanyewestisgoo, predicting a rally to $400 by 2025. Thecryptomist, another crypto analyst, expects the altcoin to hit $300 in the coming days. DTX Exchange (DTX): Why Savvy Investors are Betting on it Over Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) As an up-and-coming cryptocurrency, DTX Exchange’s upside potential is largely unrivaled. It has more room for growth than top crypto coins like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL), fueling demand. As it prepares to transform the global trading scene, $0.12 as the token price might be this year’s best bargain.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) investors are pivoting to Lunex Network (LNEX), a quickly growing altcoin. Table of Contents Shiba Inu sees mixed price forecasts Pepe whale activity rises but long-term holders exit Lunex Network: Redefining privacy and profitability Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (Pepe) investors are diversifying into Lunex Network , an altcoin that is growing rapidly in the crypto space. Features like 18% APY staking rewards, seamless swaps across forty blockchains, and a deflationary token model position Lunex Network as the next big thing in the crypto marketplace. With its multi-chain trading and privacy-focused features, Lunex Network seeks to provide an advantage that appeals to both experienced and new investors. Shiba Inu sees mixed price forecasts Shiba Inu has gained 6.1% within the last twenty-four hours, 23.1% in the week, and 63.5% since November. Notably, Shiba Inu’s price has risen by 249.6% since December 2023. Some experts think Shiba Inu could slip up and trade at $0.00002936 by January 29, 2025, representing a 7.61% fall from current levels. However, others believe Shiba Inu might carry on its upward trend. A pro-crypto U.S. President along with heightened interest from banks in crypto-based ETFs suggest bullish signs for the industry. In case the trend improves, Shiba Inu might rally more and possibly reach a new all-time high. Pepe whale activity rises but long-term holders exit The dynamics surrounding Pepe are shifting as whale activity intensifies while long-term investor interest declines. Recent data from IntoTheBlock shows a reversal in whale net flows, with a jump from a 534-billion-token outflow to a 580-billion-token inflow by December 3. Notably, a single whale withdrew 337 billion Pepe tokens worth $7 million from Binance over the past 20 days, sparking speculation of FOMO-driven retail buying. However, the token’s long-term holders have been dwindling, with addresses holding Pepe for over a year dropping from 91,200 in November to 89,000. Mid-term Pepe holders fell even more sharply, from 200,000 to 89,000 in the same timeframe. Meanwhile, short-term trading surged by 262%, with 72,000 new addresses joining in just 30 days. With Pepe consolidating at $0.000020 and a market cap of $8.69 billion, its heavy reliance on short-term traders and fluctuating whale activity has raised questions about its long-term stability, driving some investors to seek alternatives.

This project will utilize advanced smart contracts to offer quick swaps at lower transaction fees to its users. Unlike traditional platforms, Lunex Network prioritizes user privacy, eliminating KYC checks. This unique approach will allow fully anonymous trading, appealing to security-conscious investors seeking greater control over their data. What truly sets Lunex Network apart is its generous staking rewards. Those who hold LNEX tokens will be able to make as much as 18% APY through staking, opening the doors for a simple method to earn passive income. Additionally, the platform’s revenue-sharing model will return a percentage of its earnings to token holders so that they can benefit from Lunex Network’s growth. With a capped supply of 8 billion tokens and a deflationary mechanism, Lunex Network will produce scarcity that attracts long-term value investors. Currently priced at $0.0038 in its presale, Lunex Network has already delivered over 200% returns for early investors who bought in at $0.0012. The presale has raised more than $4 million, signaling strong momentum. Industry analysts predict that LNEX could hit $1 within months as its popularity grows, making it a promising investment.

Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas gave this inference earlier on December 6 on X. To put this in perspective, these spot Bitcoin ETFs hold as much as 1.104 million BTC, while Satoshi’s stash is only 1.1 million coins. Bitcoin ETF Products Keep Beating the Odds In Balchunas’ opinion, this milestone is mind-blowing, considering that they were launched on January 11, less than one year ago. Only two days ago, TheCoinRise reported that BTC ETFs were fast closing in on Satoshi regarding Bitcoin holding. At this time, their BTC holding had only climbed to $676 million . Out of all eleven spot BTC ETFs approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has dominated tremendously. The product has outperformed its counterparts with $50 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). Previously, Balchunas predicted that BlackRock’s IBIT would become the sole biggest holder of Bitcoin come next year. MicroStrategy Holds 402,100 BTC Binance, the US government, and business intelligence software company MicroStrategy are already ranked as the top Bitcoin holders. Michael Saylor-led MicroStrategy recently purchased 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion. This acquisition took its total Bitcoin holdings to 402,100 BTC, now surging past $40.8 billion. It is worth noting that ascertaining these firms’ and individuals’ exact Bitcoin holdings is usually challenging. According to the prominent blockchain analytics platform Chainalysis, Satoshi owns 1.124 million BTC across 36,000 wallets. If this estimate is correct, the pseudonymous creator of the flagship digital currency may still be the largest holder. Satoshi Nakamoto’s Identity Remains a Mystery On the one hand, there is a low likelihood that Satoshi will ever touch any of those wallets, considering how keen he is on remaining hidden . Speculations are that the Bitcoin creator is dead, even Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently argued the same. In October, the HBO documentary Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery tried to reveal the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Peter Todd, an early Bitcoin developer, was hand-picked by director Cullen Hoback to be Nakamoto . However, he was quick to dismiss the claim. Hence, there is still a mystery about who the real Satoshi Nakamoto is.

37306305,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624081,1733522136,Czech Republic exempts long-held Bitcoin from capital gains tax,"The Czech Republic has announced a tax policy that does not tax Bitcoin that has been held for three or more years. This amendment was approved on December 6, 2024, and will be effective from January 1, 2025. According to the new law, citizens are allowed to exclude earned income from their personal income tax if they earned up to 100,000 Czech crowns from cryptocurrencies. The exemption will also apply to Bitcoin and other digital assets that were owned for three or more years before being sold. The policy brings cryptocurrency taxation compliance in line with the current regulation of other financial instruments, including stocks. However, it does not include electronic cash tokens and takes effect only for assets that are not used in business for at least three years after cessation of self-employment. The amendment is similar to tax exemptions applicable to securities transactions, which caps the total gains from securities, business shares, and cryptocurrencies at CZK 40 million. Simplified tax framework, lingering questions At the moment, the Czech Republic levies a flat rate of 15% on Bitcoin revenues for individuals and 19% for companies. Those people who earn high wages are taxed at a rate of 23%. The new changes that are to be implemented permit pre-2025 purchased assets to be exempted based on the new provisions. However, the reform has some ambiguity in some areas. Taxpayers are also not sure how to establish the period of possession. Additionally, they are seeking to know whether all types of digital assets are exempted from tax under the law. In particular, the Income Tax Act does not offer a clear definition of digital assets, which has left many people in the dark. Experts support for tax reform This amendment has been applauded by experts in cryptocurrency. BTC Prague pointed out that the support for the law was unanimous. He further stated that the exemption could lead to long-term Bitcoin investments. KPMG noted that the framework is based on securities taxation principles that are already known.

42416800,e48883e4-f392-4947-9a03-9ff6172cdd54,1733522025,Ending the Treasury Department’s Regulatory Overreach on Crypto Mixer Tornado Cash,"Cryptocurrency users who crave privacy protections had a lot to be thankful for this past Thanksgiving.    Two days before the holiday, a unanimous three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) had acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner not supported by substantial evidence when it “overstepped its congressionally defined authority” in sanctioning “Tornado Cash’s open-source, self-executing software” instead of “the rogue persons and entities who abuse it.”    In plain English, Congress didn’t give OFAC the power to do what it did: sanction software code owned by no one.    But let’s back up. As I have explained for CoinDesk before, Tornado Cash is a crypto mixer that makes it tougher to trace cryptocurrency transactions. There are many legitimate and legal uses of such a service, but there are illegal uses too. For example, cyber criminals and hostile state actors have used Tornado Cash and other services to shield their nefarious acts.    Because of the latter actions, OFAC added many Tornado Cash addresses to its Specifically Designated National and Blocked Persons (SDN) list.    But under the relevant statutory provisions, Congress gave OFAC only the power to sanction the property, including any interest in the property, of certain people.    And here, the court, in an opinion written by Judge Don Willett, said that the immutable smart contracts at issue didn’t constitute property, so OFAC couldn’t sanction them.    The court said “because that element is dispositive, [it] need not address the other elements” at issue in the case. It said that the “district court erred in giving ‘heightened deference’ to OFAC’s definition of ‘property’ and in finding that immutable smart contracts met that definition.”    Because of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Loper Bright decision from last term doing away with Chevron deference — the requirement that courts defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory (or even regulatory!) provisions — the court said it was engaging in the “unremarkable, yet elemental proposition” of applying its own judgment to determine what a statute means.    Doing that, the court said that under both the plain meaning of property and under OFAC’s regulatory definition of property, the term means something that can be owned. And in this case, the immutable smart contracts at issue did not qualify as property because they cannot be owned.    The court went further, though, and made two points that might have implications for crypto and smart contracts more broadly.    First, the court said the immutable smart contracts at issue are not themselves contracts — despite their misleading name and contrary to what the district court held.    While the district court found the contracts to be “merely a code-enabled species of unilateral contracts,” the Fifth Circuit panel said that in “so finding, the district court ignored basic principles of black-letter contract law.” It explained that all contracts require at least two parties, but here, the immutable smart contracts “have only one party in play” because they are “just software code,” not a party who can contract with another party.    The Fifth Circuit made clear that its decision is not contrary to the “blockchain caselaw,” which indicates that some smart contracts could, in fact, function as contracts because in those other cases, at least two willing parties agreed to enter into the contract. But here, with the ownerless immutable smart contracts, “there is no party with which to contract.”    Second, the court held that the immutable smart contracts at issue are not themselves a service but are “more like a tool that is used in performing a service,” which is “not the same as being a service.”    Finally, the court ended with a note on its proper role within our constitutional system of government. It said that while it “readily recognize[s] the real-world downsides of certain uncontrollable technology falling outside of OFAC’s sanctioning authority,” courts “must uphold the statutory bargain struck (or mis-struck) by Congress, not tinker with it.” It declined to engage in “judicial lawmaking” by mending the “statute’s blind spots or smoothing out its disruptive effects.” It said to do so “falls outside of [the court’s] lane” because “Legislating is Congress’s job — and Congress’s alone.”    It's unclear whether the government will ask the full Fifth Circuit to review the decision or whether it will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review it. Notably, the Eleventh Circuit still has a similar case pending before it. If it reaches a different conclusion or uses different reasons to reach even the same, or a similar, conclusion, that could motivate the Supreme Court to review the case.    Of course, it will be interesting to see what position the incoming Trump Administration will take on this case too. It may very well be that the new administration will agree that the Biden Administration’s OFAC should not have taken this unprecedented action.    And, of course, Congress could always act too.    So, for now, it’s good news for the crypto community.

Trump announced the South African-born businessman’s appointment to the new role late Thursday, noting that Sacks will A.I. and cryptocurrency policy during the former reality television star’s second term in the Oval Office. “He will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for and can thrive in the U.S.,” Trump said in a December 5 Truth Social post announcing the news. Brad Garlinghouse’s Legal Fight Against The SEC Garlinghouse’s Ripple Labs has long been involved in a dispute with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegedly violating the country’s federal securities law. Many in the crypto community see the commission’s enforcement actions against Ripple as excessive. The federal regulator is also doling out litigation against several key players in the crypto industry, including Kraken and Coinbase. SEC chair Gary Gensler has been largely condemned for his regulation-by-enforcement approach to the blockchain sector as a whole. However, he has since announced his decision to depart the regulator ahead the former reality television star’s inauguration on January 20. In his farewell statement , Gensler acknowledged that “the Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency. It has been an honor to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans.” Trump, who previously pledged to fire the agency’s head, has since announced Gensler’s replacement as crypto-friendly former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. Atkins is widely expected to take a softer, more balanced approach to digital assets. Sacks, meanwhile, is a Silicon Valley veteran who will seemingly enact a blockchain-friendly regulatory framework . The appointment of several pro-crypto proponents will virtually ensure that Trump fulfills his promise to introduce cryptocurrency policies that benefit the sector. However, it remains to be seen exactly what those guidelines will look like.

The blueprint signals that the country’s ambition is to become a global leader while aligning its innovation goals by 2030. The report outlines strategies for applying AI across key industries while addressing challenges like inconsistent technology practices. However, the timing of the release is contentious, as China’s AI models face scrutiny for censorship. China wants to drive AI growth across industries China’s State Information Center (SIC) released a report that translates to “Reference Architecture for the Construction and Development of Artificial Intelligence Industry Applications ” on Friday . The report seems to be a guide for developing AI technologies in the region. Notably, the release comes at a controversial time when China’s AI models are in focus. While they are being applauded for their advanced capabilities, models often self-censor or avoid addressing political topics on government instructions. Cryptopolitan recently did a detailed report on how Chinese censorship could influence global perceptions of the power of AI. The SIC report says that the Chinese government places significant importance on artificial intelligence (AI). PBC has been prioritizing AI and in April, it announced the development of a global AI innovation hub by 2030. You won't believe what they're doing in China. This is the Chinese port in Guangzhou.

This means that the manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, finance, and consumer services sectors can see increased use of AI. The report also identifies challenges and opportunities for AI integration in these fields. However, the question remains how censorship will continue to impact the growth and development of China’s AI technologies, particularly in open innovation and global collaboration. Restrictions on sensitive topics and controlled narratives could potentially limit the adaptability and competitiveness of Chinese AI models in international markets. Countries will have to address censorship challenges The report also outlines a “reference architecture” for building and scaling AI applications. This framework includes six key components. Computing power infrastructure ensures the necessary hardware and processing capabilities. Data services handle the organization, storage, and accessibility of the vast datasets AI systems require. Model services focus on the algorithms and AI systems that drive intelligent decision-making. Application development provides tools and methodologies to create user-facing AI solutions, while operation and maintenance platforms ensure these systems run smoothly and securely.

China’s plan now is to place a comprehensive structure to streamline AI integration, aligning with its 2030 target of an AI innovation hub. By the looks of things, China has taken a standardized approach. The report aims to overcome challenges caused by inconsistent technologies or data practices across companies. The report also prioritizes lowering costs for developing and replicating AI applications. It also looks at fostering innovation and market activity. This will come alongside the large-scale adoption of AI in various industries.

37305343,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658519,1733520607,Trump’s Crypto Czar David Sacks Is Super Bullish For Solana: Here’s Why,"Solana (SOL) could be one of the biggest winners from the nomination of David O. Sacks as White House Director of Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency. President-elect Donald J. Trump has appointed David Sacks as “Crypto Czar” on Thursday. Trump stated that Sacks will work to develop a legal framework to provide the crypto industry with the clarity it has been seeking, allowing the industry to flourish in the United States. Sacks brings a high-profile background to the role: he was Chief Operating Officer of PayPal during its formative years and serves as an advisor to the 0x protocol. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Could See A Correction Despite Historic Monthly Close, $400 Still On Sight? Known for his long standing support of Bitcoin as a decentralized hedge against traditional finance and a proponent of decentralized finance (DeFi) for increasing transparency in the financial system, Sacks has also invested in multiple cryptocurrency projects through his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures. Why Sacks Is Super Bullish For Solana Among his most notable exposures is his early investment in the Solana blockchain, achieved through the crypto-focused investment firm Multicoin Capital. In 2023, Sacks confirmed that he maintained his Solana (SOL) position despite the FTX-related market turbulence and remained “up big.” Craft Ventures’ early involvement with Solana, via Multicoin Capital, reportedly generated substantial returns. According to Sacks’ own account on a podcast (when SOL stood at $169), this investment soared to a valuation around $1 billion. “That fund, I mean, it’s like a 100x fund, it’s just like bonkers. And so as a result of that, we are indirect beneficiaries of this huge increase in Solana. It will end up being about, you know, a billion dollars of, I think, Solana for us in terms of returns, but the MultiCoin guys determine the trading decisions on that,” Sacks revealed during a podcast. Sacks has discussed Solana in detail on the All-In Podcast with Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder and CEO of Social Capital. Their conversations have highlighted Solana’s capability to support rapid, cost-effective transactions at scale, often comparing its architecture and throughput favorably against that of Ethereum. “There’s a lot of people, I’d say smart money in Silicon Valley, who are betting on a flippening where Solana could ultimately overtake Ethereum as the preferred platform,” Sacks remarked. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ATH Sparks $309 Price Prediction Frenzy – Details Notably, a spot Solana ETF is just around the corner in the US with 5 applications already filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. With the appointment of Sacks, the likelihood of a spot SOL ETF following the departure of Gary Gensler as SEC Chairman on January 20 is likely to have increased further. Solana’s strong fundamentals and growing institutional recognition are being reflected in its price action. At press time, Solana is trading just below a new all-time high established two days ago at $264.39, having surpassed its previous record from October 2021 at $259.90. Should SOL breach this newly formed resistance level, technical analysts point to potential upside targets. These include the 1.272 Fibonacci extension at around $328 and the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at approximately $415. At press time, SOL traded at $234.

37305921,https://blockworks.co/news/pumpdotfun-restricts-uk-access,1733520600,Pump.fun restricts access for UK users,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The team behind the memecoin launchpad pump.fun began restricting UK users this morning. The move came days after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority tagged pump.fun as unauthorized. Most firms need the regulator’s approval to do finance-related business in the country. It’s apparently the platform’s first public restriction, despite facing past criticism for its fast-and-loose approach to moderation. Notably, pump.fun — which allows users to launch Solana-based tokens for around $2 — took down its livestreaming feature last week after a number of violent and disturbing streams went viral. The site’s UK block doesn’t represent a ban per se, Shardspace co-founder Avaunt said in the Lightspeed Telegram chat. Rather, pump.fun likely never properly registered and complied with the UK’s crypto guidelines, and the regulator is just now holding it accountable. Pump.fun has some apparent links to the UK. When the then-nascent platform was exploited by former contractor Jarett Dunn in May, he was arrested in London . Dunn, a notorious online troll, did make a seemingly-serious claim that pump.fun is linked to a UK-based entity called Baton Corporation. “Pump is not legally based in the UK,” the platform’s pseudonymous founder alon told me in a text, but they declined to elaborate further. Zooming out for a second though, it’s somewhat surprising a pump.fun restriction took this long in the first place. The UK is no crypto libertarian paradise — for example, prediction market favorite Polymarket is already unavailable there. The UK’s financial regulator claims to have taken down “over 900 scam crypto websites and over 50 apps” since October 2023. “Thought IP [address] restrictions were pretty common in this industry lol not quite sure why [everyone is] freaking out,” Tom, anonymous contributor to Raydium, told me in a text. Pump.fun has been the most popular app on Solana — and at times in all of crypto — for much of this year. With that popularity will inevitably come scrutiny, especially when users are beheading chickens on livestream in hopes of making a token’s price go up. If Gary Gensler’s SEC tenure were to continue past this year, it’s hard to imagine the SEC wouldn’t have taken some sort of action against pump.fun, too. How the fallout from pump.fun’s livestream snafu settles will be something to watch. Perhaps regulators will be able to do what criticism or backlash never could — slow down a startup that has already generated $283 million in revenue in its first year of existence.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-rescues-usa-trumpusa-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

XRP is currently trading between $1.60 and $2.67, showing impressive growth with a 1-week price change of 49.95% and a 1-month surge of 348.85%. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.04. If it breaks through, it could target the second resistance at $4.12. The 10-day simple moving average is $2.33, slightly below the 100-day average of $2.50, hinting at a potential upward trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 44.58, indicating that XRP is not overbought. With the crypto market anticipating an altcoin season and a global bull run, XRP could see significant gains in the near future. TRON (TRX) Ready for a Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches TRON's price is currently between $0.19 and $0.22, showing strong growth over the past six months with an increase of over 180%. The nearest resistance is at $0.23, and breaking this level could push the price toward $0.26. In the last week alone, TRX has risen nearly 60%, and over the past month, it has surged by more than 100%. The Relative Strength Index is around 43, indicating room for further growth. The low stochastic value suggests potential for an upswing. If TRX moves above the simple moving averages, which are currently higher than the price, we could see significant bullish movement as altcoin season gains momentum. Dogecoin Set to Soar as Altcoin Season Nears and Bull Run Gains Momentum Dogecoin is showing signs of upward momentum with its current price between $0.3868 and $0.4724. Over the past month, it has surged by over 155%, indicating strong investor interest. The 10-day simple moving average is slightly above the 100-day average, suggesting a positive trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 50, implying the coin is not overbought. If Dogecoin breaks the nearest resistance level at $0.5042, it could target the next resistance near $0.5898, potentially increasing by another 20%. With the anticipated altcoin season and a bullish crypto market, Dogecoin may be set for significant growth in the coming weeks. Conclusion While XRP, TRX, and DOGE show limited short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering 700% ROI in its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and triple utility through governance, rewards, and staking, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains.

Following the release of documents obtained by Coinbase through the FOIA, Coinase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, took to X (formerly Twitter) to talk about the challenges the crypto industry faced at the hands of the FDIC and the banks that acted to curb crypto-related activities under the regulator’s advisory. Paul also highlighted the extent to which regulatory bodies, especially the FDIC have gone to restrict crypto businesses from accessing essential banking services. Law abiding American businesses should be able to access banking services without government interference. The incoming administration has the opportunity to reverse so many poor crypto policy decisions, chief among them politically motivated regulatory decisions like Operation… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 6, 2024 Operation Chokepoint 2.0 cut off crypto businesses from banking services For a while, it felt like the crypto industry was under siege as it faced a constant barrage of enforcement action from US regulators. Recently discovered documents have confirmed that US regulators might have indeed taken active steps to stall the industry. Paul said the release of the heavily redacted documents proves that the crypto industry was targeted unfairly. He also said it provided vindication that “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” wasn’t just a myth in the crypto community and that there was actually a debanking campaign. He expressed frustration, saying, “Law abiding American businesses should be able to access banking services without government interference.” Paul pointed out that the FDIC continues to withhold key details through redaction. However, he applauded the effort of the team pursuing the FOIA requests, emphasizing the need for clarity and transparency from the government regarding regulation. He also noted that “The incoming administration has the opportunity to reverse so many poor crypto policy decisions, chief among them politically motivated regulatory decisions like Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” The lack of clarity in regulation has become a serious issue with far-reaching consequences for the crypto sector. Under the Biden administration, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against many crypto businesses, including Binance and Coinbase, two of the biggest crypto exchanges. The regulator alleged violations of securities laws, acting as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency without proper registration. FDIC letters affected crypto and banking services The FDIC letters, obtained by Coinbase through History Associates revealed that regulators discouraged banks from transacting with crypto-related businesses and, in some instances, “debanking” them. The debanking campaign was a government initiative to clamp down on legal but controversial industries. In a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, Nathan McCauley, the CEO of Anchorage Digital, a bank federally chartered in the US by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC) says it was surprised that it got debanked, considering that it is a national bank. Industry leaders like Paul said the regulatory spotlight on crypto was politically motivated. However, regulatory agencies would argue that their actions were necessary to protect customers and prevent financial crimes. They would also cite the crash of FTX and, more recently, the conviction of Binance’s founder and ex-CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who pleaded guilty to financial regulation violations. The former received a 25-year jail sentence, while the latter went to prison for four months and paid over $4 billion dollar in fines.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy That Can Make You Rich,"The crypto market has been buzzing non-stop, with 2024 bringing yet another wave of exciting projects and sky-high returns. From AI-based tokens to blockchain interoperability, there’s no shortage of innovation to get your pulse racing. But let’s face it: if you missed the Polkadot craze back in the day, you might still be kicking yourself. Polkadot turned heads as one of the hottest projects in blockchain, leaving latecomers wondering if they’d missed their chance at life-changing returns. Well, here’s the thing—you might’ve missed Polkadot’s early days, but that doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary project rewriting the rules of crypto. If you’re still searching for the Best Crypto to Buy this December, this one’s for you. Qubetics ($TICS): The Crypto That’s Redefining Web3 If there’s one name on every savvy investor’s radar right now, it’s Qubetics. Why? Because this project isn’t just about hype; it’s about delivering real-world utility in a way that’s shaking up the crypto world. Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, a platform that brings together decentralised finance (DeFi), marketplaces, and the groundbreaking concept of Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWAT). That last bit? It’s huge. RWAT lets you tokenise tangible assets like real estate, artwork, or even your side hustle’s inventory, transforming them into blockchain-based assets that anyone, anywhere, can invest in. Imagine this: a small coffee shop in Chicago tokenises its future earnings, letting customers (and fans) invest directly. Or a real estate developer in Dubai tokenises luxury properties, giving global investors a piece of the action without needing to jump through traditional hoops. Even individuals can get in on the action—imagine flipping tokenised sports memorabilia for profit! And it’s not just about the concept. Qubetics is delivering results. As of today, the presale is in its 11th stage, with more than 275 million $TICS tokens sold to over 6,800 holders, raising over $4.6 million. The current price? A very enticing $0.0282, up approximately 8.8% from its earlier stage price of $0.025. Those who got in early are already seeing returns, and analysts are predicting even more explosive growth ahead. So, let’s break down what those predictions look like. Say you invest $5,000 in $TICS at its current price of $0.0282. If the token reaches $0.25 by the end of the presale, your investment balloons to approximately $44,252.75. Post-presale, $1 per token would net you about $177,011. And if $TICS hits $15 after the mainnet launch? That’s approximately $2.65 million in your pocket. Talk about turning your dreams into reality! Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics made it because it’s not just another token riding the hype wave—it’s solving real-world problems with actual use cases that impact everyday lives. Its combination of cutting-edge innovation and enormous ROI potential makes it the Best Crypto to Buy if you’re looking to strike gold in 2024. Polkadot: A Steady Performer, But Does It Still Have the Wow Factor? Let’s switch gears and talk about Polkadot. Now, Polkadot’s no stranger to the spotlight. Since its launch in 2020, it’s been a major player in the blockchain world, thanks to its mission of connecting multiple blockchains into one harmonious ecosystem. Think of Polkadot as the translator that helps blockchains “talk” to each other, making it easier for developers to build and share data. Its key innovation is the “parachain” system. These parachains are like mini-blockchains that plug into Polkadot’s main network. They allow for scalability, customisation, and reduced congestion—basically solving some of the biggest issues with older blockchains like Ethereum. Developers love it, and Polkadot quickly became a darling in the crypto world. But here’s the flip side: for regular investors, Polkadot doesn’t pack the same punch it used to. Its DOT token has been stable but far from explosive in recent years. While its current price of around $8 offers decent growth potential, it’s not exactly the moonshot you’re hoping for. Even if DOT climbs to $10 by the end of December, you’re looking at a modest gain—not bad, but not enough to fuel your private jet dreams. Polkadot’s focus remains on developers, which is great for the tech side of things but less exciting for investors searching for projects that can disrupt industries and deliver massive ROI. Plus, the competitive auction system for parachain slots means that smaller projects often get sidelined, limiting the overall ecosystem’s diversity. Why did this coin make it to this list? Polkadot deserves a spot here because it’s still a strong, stable option for investors seeking consistent, long-term growth. Its innovation in blockchain interoperability laid the groundwork for the industry. But let’s be real: if you’re looking for life-changing gains, Polkadot might not be your golden ticket. Why Qubetics Takes the Crown When it comes to choosing the Best Crypto to Buy, Qubetics edges out Polkadot with its combination of innovation, accessibility, and sheer potential. While Polkadot is sticking to its developer-friendly roots, Qubetics is opening up new doors for investors, businesses, and everyday users alike. Think about it: Polkadot feels like the crypto equivalent of a seasoned pro—reliable but not necessarily exciting anymore. Qubetics, on the other hand, is the young upstart, bursting with energy and ideas that could reshape industries. Its presale momentum and future ROI projections make it the clear winner for anyone ready to dive into crypto and chase those life-changing gains. Conclusion Missed the Polkadot frenzy? No worries—you’ve got a second chance with Qubetics . This isn’t just a crypto token; it’s a revolution in the making, with innovations like Real World Asset Tokenisation poised to disrupt industries across the board. With its presale heating up and analysts predicting jaw-dropping ROI, Qubetics is hands-down the Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024. Don’t let another opportunity pass you by—because in the world of crypto, timing is everything. Ready to make your move? Get in on $TICS today and watch your investment soar.

Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) joined the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) in locking in new closing highs. The moves came after the Labor Department's November nonfarm payrolls came in at 227K, exceeding the 211K consensus estimate. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from 4.1%, in-line with forecasts. The “labor market remains in a good position,"" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Friday. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) finished Friday +0.8%, and the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) +0.3%. The Dow ( DJI ), meanwhile, -0.3%, with Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Chevron ( CVX ) among losing stocks. For the week, the Nasdaq popped up +3%, and the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) picked up 1%. The Dow ( DJI ), however, fell -0.6% . “The Nasdaq-100 ( NDX ) and the S&P 500 continue to make new highs, further irritating wrong-headed bears and providing more dopamine to addled bulls,"" Alex King, investing group leader of Cestrian Capital Research , told Seeking Alpha. November's nonfarm payrolls rebounded from October's +12K print that hit by hurricanes and a workers' strike at Boeing ( BA ). ""Looking at the three market average of ~ 160k jobs, we see a healthy, although weakening, job market,"" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said Friday. ""Despite the strong headline number this morning, the Fed is likely to note the overall slowing in the job market and cut rates by 25 bps in two weeks, unless the next CPI report is white hot,"" he said. The November Consumer Price Index inflation report is due next week. Odds for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's December 17-18 meeting jumped to ~85% on Friday, from Thursday's 71% probability, according to the CME FedWatch tool . This year's advances for large-cap stocks have been aided by the Federal Reserve starting its rate-cutting cycle that investors expect will continue this month. The S&P 500 ( SP500 ) has bulked up nearly 28% this year. ""We are very focused on remaining dead inside in order to take advantage of the coming twists and turns in the market,"" King said. ""We continue to look upwards into year-end but note a slew of important technical resistance levels coming up; we think it is time to be nimble if needed.” In the fixed-income market Friday, the 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) lost 2 basis points to 4.15%, and the 2-year yield ( US2Y ) was down 4 basis points at 4.09%. The Fed has cut interest rates by 75 basis points this year to 4.5%-4.75%. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said Friday she favors taking a slow pace in adjusting interest rates. ""Moving slowly will allow us to calibrate policy to the appropriately restrictive level over time given the underlying strength in the economy,"" she said Friday at the City Club of Cleveland, according to prepared remarks. In other economic news, consumer sentiment drifted up in December. The University of Michigan's U.S. Consumer Sentiment report came in at 74.0 versus 73.0 consensus, and 71.8 in November. Four sectors on the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) rose, paced by Consumer Discretionary +2.4%. Energy -1.6%, down with six other groups. Among active stocks, Lululemon ( LULU ) +15.9%, the best S&P 500 ( SP500 ) performer after the yoga clothing maker raised its FY24 guidance above expectations and increased its share buyback program by $1B. DocuSign ( DOCU ) +27.9% and Ulta Beauty ( ULTA ) +9% on strong quarterly results.

In the current market cycle, where many are searching for promising opportunities, $POPCAT presents itself as a noteworthy contender in the realm of digital assets.

It is building an open, permissionless, decentralized machine learning network with a crypto economy.

Jupiter's JUP Token: A Rising Star in Solana's DeFi Ecosystem Jupiter is a leading platform in Decentralised Finance on the Solana blockchain. It is known as the most popular DEX aggregator globally. Jupiter pools resources to enable efficient token swaps, futures trading, and decentralised stablecoin management.

The upcoming JUP airdrop on January 31, 2024, will distribute one billion JUP tokens to nearly 955,000 wallets, rewarding early adopters and active users. With its innovative approach and governance via the JUP token, Jupiter has significant potential for growth in Solana’s ecosystem. The coin looks attractive in the current market cycle.

AVA Token: Inspired by Ava, Thailand's Rare Golden Tiger Cub Ava is a rare golden tiger cub from Thailand, known for her unique golden coat resulting from recessive genes; fewer than 100 golden tigers exist worldwide. Her growing internet fame has led to the creation of AVA Token, a community-driven cryptocurrency project. AVA Token is currently available on decentralized exchanges and seeks to harness the momentum of Ava's popularity during the current altcoin season. The project draws parallels with the recent success of MOODENG, which experienced significant gains. With plans for future listings on centralized exchanges, AVA Token presents potential in the current market cycle for those interested in emerging digital assets linked to viral phenomena.

Offering a remarkable 700% ROI in its presale and triple utility through governance, incentives, and staking, it brings together crypto fans to combat crypto villains and achieve new heights.

In a post on social media platform X, Semler Scientific chairman and founder Eric Semler says the California-based firm just bought an additional 303 BTC for its crypto trove. The development comes as Semler Scientific sees significant gains in its BTC Yield, a metric that the company uses to track the success of its Bitcoin strategy. “Semler Scientific has acquired 303 BTC for ~$29.3 million at ~$96,779 per Bitcoin and has generated BTC Yield of 54.7% QTD and 78.7% since adopting our BTC treasury strategy in May.” Semler Scientific says it bought Bitcoin using the proceeds from the sale of shares in its at-the-market (ATM) offering. With its recent purchase, the company now holds 1,873 BTC, which was bought for $147.1 million at $78,553 per Bitcoin. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading for $96,733. Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy is still the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The company also recently bought 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion at an individual average price of $95,976. It now owns 402,100 BTC which were bought at an average price of $58,263 per Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s BTC stash now represents 1.9% of the total Bitcoin supply, which is capped at 21 million.

37305033,https://blockworks.co/news/coinbase-shares-fdic-letters,1733518800,Coinbase’s fray with the FDIC continues,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Remember when the SEC sued Coinbase last year for alleged securities violations? And then earlier this year, the crypto exchange launched suits against the SEC and FDIC after its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests were denied? Related, Coinbase on Friday shared letters from the FDIC. The documents, according to chief legal officer Paul Grewal, show that “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 wasn’t just some crypto conspiracy theory.” A March 2022 letter about a proposed “fintech product” (written by FDIC assistant regional director Eric Guyot) notes, for example, the FDIC “has not yet determined what, if any, regulatory filings will be necessary for a bank to engage in this type of activity.” Guyot then adds: “As a result, we respectfully ask that you pause all crypto asset-related activity .” The black highlighter tool (i.e., government redactions) was used plenty on that letter and others. The FDIC is “still hiding behind way overbroad redactions,” Grewal explained. History Associates, a consultancy firm Coinbase hired in 2023 to help retrieve records , said in a Friday court filing that it’s not satisfied with what the FDIC produced. First, the letters appear to redact information about the type of digital asset products or services at issue, History Associates notes. And secondly, heavy redactions in four specific letters “makes it difficult for History Associates to evaluate whether the FDIC has disclosed all non-exempt portions of those letters.” The FDIC claims, according to the court filing, that the redactions help protect the identity of the banks. An FDIC spokesperson declined to comment further. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 claims resurfaced recently when a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen said on Joe Rogan’s podcast that roughly 30 tech and crypto founders have been debanked in recent years. “Law-abiding American businesses should be able to access banking services without government interference,” Grewal added on X, noting the incoming administration can reverse course.

37304582,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624062,1733518527,OpenAI’s most recent “reasoning” model in basic errors,"OpenAI recently released a “reasoning” AI model – o1, but it is already rocked with basic errors, according to the company’s new ad. The ChatGPT maker released what it has termed its most advanced model to date for paying subscribers kicking off its “ 12 Days of OpenAI ” event, which is a series of releases to celebrate the holiday season. An OpenAI demo video suggests the model is prone to errors According to a video OpenAI released to show the model’s strengths, a user uploads an image of a wooden birdhouse and then asks the model for some advice on how to build a similar one. The “reasoning” model appears to “think” for a moment before giving out what appears to be a set of instructions. Upon a closer look , the instructions appear to be a waste of time. The model measures the required material for the task such as paint, glue, and sealant but it only provides dimensions for the front panel of the birdhouse. The model suggests cutting a piece of sandpaper to another set of dimensions that are not necessary. Additionally, the model states that it is giving “the exact dimensions” but gives no exact dimensions, contrary to its earlier claims. James Filus, the director of the Institute of Carpenters, a UK-based trade body also exposed the model’s errors, such as tools that are needed but missing from o1’s list for instance a hammer. “You would know just as much about building the birdhouse from the image as you would the text, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of the AI tool.” Filus. Additionally, Filus also revealed that the cost of building the same birdhouse would be “nowhere near” the $20 to $50 that the model estimated. The OpenAI model does the opposite of the intended use The o1 case adds to other examples of AI models’ product demos where they do the opposite of the intended purpose. In 2023, a Google advert for an AI-assisted search tool wrongfully indicated that the James Webb telescope had made a discovery it had not. This mistake resulted in the company’s stock price dropping. This was not all from the search engine giant as recently an updated version of a similar Google tool told users that it was safe to eat rocks . It also claimed that users could use glue to stick cheese to their pizza. Despite the mistakes, the o1 model, according to the public benchmarks, remains OpenAI’s most capable model to date. It also takes a different approach from ChatGPT when answering questions. According to Time, o1 is still a very advanced next-word predictor as it was trained using machine learning on billions of words of text from the internet and beyond. The model uses a technique known as “chain of thought” reasoning to “think” about an answer for a moment behind the scenes and gives its answer only after that. This is different from just giving out words in response to a prompt. This helps the model give more accurate responses as opposed to a case where it just spits out words in response to user queries.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Ki Young Ju says that by the time the top crypto asset by market cap reaches $1 million, it will have overtaken gold. According to Ju, the crypto king reaching nine figures is inevitable as investor demand shifts from gold to BTC. “In 2004, before gold ETFs were approved, gold’s market cap was $1 trillion. Today, it’s $17.8 trillion. If we assume gold’s intrinsic value as a precious metal is $1 trillion, then around $16.8 trillion represents its demand as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin’s current market cap is $2 trillion, and it could go up 750% if gold demand shifts to BTC. Considering inflation, Bitcoin reaching $1 million isn’t about if it will happen – it’s about when. People will start discussing the gold flippening within five years.” Ju goes on to note that BTC has yet to form a bubble, despite reaching the $100,000 milestone for the first time ever earlier this week. “Fresh capital is fueling Bitcoin. As the realized cap grew, the ceiling price increased from $129,000 to $146,000 in 30 days. At $102,000 it’s far from a bubble – it would need a 43% surge to hit the threshold often considered a bubble.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $99,069 at time of writing, a 1.8% decrease during the last 24 hours.

The measure, which was unanimously approved by parliament on December 6, will come into effect on January 1, 2025. The new law introduces clear rules for tax exemptions for cryptocurrency transactions. According to Czech news outlet Parlamentní Listy, individuals will be able to benefit from tax relief under two main conditions: Income Limit: Annual gross income from cryptocurrency transactions must not exceed 100,000 CZK (approximately $4,000). Holding Period: Digital assets must be held for at least three years before being sold to benefit from the exemption. Prime Minister Petr Fiala described the new law as a win for innovation and modern technologies. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he said: “If you hold cryptocurrencies for more than three years, their sale will not be taxed. We have pushed for better conditions for cryptocurrencies to make people's lives easier and support modern technologies.” The Czech Republic's reforms are in line with the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, which will come into full force on December 30, 2024. *This is not investment advice.

37305333,https://thecoinrise.com/bitget-launches-gmci-meme-index-to-celebrate-crypto-creativity/,1733517769,Bitget Launches GMCI Meme Index to Celebrate Crypto Creativity,"Bitget, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has recently introduced the GMCI Meme Index, a new addition to its futures trading platform. This index combines the top memecoins by market capitalization, reflecting the humor and creativity driving much of the cryptocurrency world. In a statement on December 6, Bitget highlighted that this initiative celebrates the vibrant culture of crypto. At the same time, it is designed to give traders a structured way to explore the fast-growing memecoin sector. What is the GMCI Meme Index? The GMCI Meme Index is a list of 25 popular meme coins, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). It also includes emerging tokens like Brett (BRETT), Mog (MOG), Popcat (POPCAT), and Dogs (DOGS). Combining these coins into one index, Bitget simplifies access to the meme coin market. This initiative will allow traders to benefit from the growth of these culturally relevant tokens. The index has already seen a 460% return this year, with Bitget using strict criteria to select tokens. The tokens must show high trading volumes, strong market capitalization, and active community participation to be listed. To keep the index relevant, Bitget rebalances it monthly, adjusting for market trends and performance. Additionally, no single coin can dominate the index; a 25% cap on weight ensures diversity and reduces risks. In other news, Bitget recently launched its UK platform, offering British traders access to over 150 cryptocurrencies . The move reflects the exchange’s commitment to providing diverse options for regional users in the crypto market. Relevance of Memecoins in the Crypto Industry Meme coins have become a defining feature of crypto culture despite originally starting as jokes or internet trends. Digital coins like Dogecoin have gained massive popularity due to their humor and the enthusiastic communities behind them. The GMCI Meme Index gives these coins a platform combining cultural importance with a legitimate trading strategy. This initiative will make them accessible to both seasoned investors and newcomers. While memecoins hold financial and cultural importance, they bring benefits and challenges to the crypto community. They create wealth and internet buzz but pose risks for investors and platforms. Binance’s CMO, Rachel Conlan, recently stressed the need to evaluate these projects carefully. Expanding on Bitget’s Innovations The GMCI Meme Index is not Bitget’s first step into offering innovative trading tools. The company launched the GMCI 30 Index, which tracks the top 30 cryptocurrencies based on circulating market capitalization. This broader index paved the way for more specialized offerings like the meme coin index. Bitget has also invested heavily in other areas of cryptocurrency development. Recently, it announced a $20 million program in partnership with Foresight Ventures to boost Telegram’s Mini App ecosystem. These apps have helped expand The Open Network (TON) blockchain, connecting decentralized applications to a growing user base.

37304000,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98464,1733517626,Is Dogecoin Set to Explode? Raoul Pal Foresees Major Bullish Move Like Ripple’s XRP,"Raoul Pal thinks Dogecoin could be ready for a big move. He sees similarities between its chart and XRP’s, which made huge gains recently. Pal’s prediction has caught the attention of many investors, who wonder if DOGE is about to take off. With market uncertainty in the air, is Dogecoin primed for the next big rally? Dogecoin’s Quiet Phase Could Be Setting Up for a Breakout Since November 12, Dogecoin has been stuck in a narrow range, trading between $0.34 and $0.48. It hasn’t made any strong moves, but that could be a good sign. Raoul Pal believes the coin is forming a pattern similar to XRP’s previous chart. Similar patterns have led to huge breakouts in the past. $DOGE is another that looks similar in potential magnitude. Insane Banana's chart. Good luck all! May Lord Fishnu bless you all with Bananas. pic.twitter.com/ciTzMz3bOC — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 2, 2024 Pal lists three major “falling wedge” patterns on Dogecoin’s chart. The first wedge formed from 2014 to 2017, leading to a big rally. The second one stretched from 2018 to 2021, pushing DOGE to its all-time high of $0.74. Now, the third wedge is being triggered from mid-2021 to 2024. In Pal’s words, this could be the beginning of another breakout. Pal believes that DOGE is primed again for a major move and that the technicals mirror what happened with XRP last year. If Dogecoin breaks through this wedge, Pal expects that it could experience a significant increase, similar to XRP. Pal is not the only one who has a positive outlook for Dogecoin. Trader Tardigrade is the other analyst and identifies a bullish pennant. This is a technical pattern usually followed by a sharp increase in price. Tardigrade has set a possible target price of $1.35 for DOGE if it breaks through now. The DOGE daily chart displays a lot of trading positivity in the right range, just below the upper Bollinger Band at $0.4519, which is a common precedent for a breakout. Nevertheless, if DOGE cannot sustain the midline (currently at $0.4076), it may be correct. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 63.37, so the coin could still increase. Another analyst, CW, is also bullish. He points out an AB=CD harmonic pattern on Dogecoin’s 4-hour chart. This pattern suggests DOGE could hit $0.69 if it breaks through resistance levels in the $0.40–$0.50 range. A Favorable Market for DOGE Rally The market has been rather unstable in recent times, but instability might work in favour of Dogecoin. Bitcoin recently experienced a flash crash, dropping $10,000 in a few hours. But despite the dip, Bitcoin’s price bounced back quickly. Pal’s predictions come as investors await the next big breakout in the crypto market. With some technical conditions and analysts supporting this coin, many are waiting to see whether it will imitate XRP . Looking at Raoul Pal’s current price prediction for Dogecoin, We have quite an outlook. He expects it to pop soon, just like XRP. Given its positive macro picture and excellent technical position, DOGE is ready to rise higher, as other analysts anticipate. Of course, the crypto market can always be volatile. However, if all Pal’s assumptions are correct, Dogecoin could be the next best thing to look out for.",POSITIVE,DOGE | XRP,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/is-dogecoin-set-to-explode-raoul-pal-foresees-major-bullish-move-like-ripples-xrp/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Following the sentiment, XRP could surge to $5 by 2025, according to some analysts. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) soars ahead with a massive presale rally, crossing over $9.5 million and over 100 million tokens sold at $0.12 per token. Market Dynamics Shift as Ripple (XRP) Awaits Regulator Decision Ripple’s anticipated stablecoin launch faced an unexpected delay on December 5, 2024, triggering a market response that reshaped cryptocurrency rankings. The company’s announcement about postponing its RLUSD stablecoin launch pending New York regulatory approval led to notable changes in XRP’s market position. Trading data revealed an immediate market reaction to the news. XRP’s price moved down from $2.59, finding temporary stability at $2.31. This price movement coincided with a broader adjustment in trading patterns across major exchanges. Market activity showed clear signs of adjustment following the announcement. Trading volume data indicated a sharp decline, dropping from previous levels above $32 billion to approximately $16 billion within a 24-hour period. The market cap rankings underwent a notable shift. XRP’s total market capitalization decreased to $131.42 billion, placing it behind Tether’s $135.8 billion. Source: CoinGecko Ripple (XRP) Regulatory Status Ripple’s regulatory journey with the New York Department of Financial Services remains ongoing. The company’s straightforward announcement on X simply stated “$RLUSD isn’t launching today,” leaving the timeline open for future updates. Market data showed varying responses across different trading pairs. While some exchanges reported increased selling pressure, others maintained more balanced order books, suggesting diverse market interpretations of the news. Price support levels emerged around key technical points. The $2.21 level proved particularly noteworthy, serving as a foundation for price action following the initial market response. Trading patterns indicated evolving market sentiment. The decrease in volume coincided with narrowing price ranges, suggesting a period of price discovery as markets processed the news. The stablecoin market context added another dimension to the story. With stablecoin trading volumes reaching $317.13 billion over 24 hours, the sector’s dynamics highlighted the potential impact of Ripple’s delayed entry. Chart analysis revealed key technical developments. Bollinger Bands showed decreasing volatility, while price action remained below the 100-hour Simple Moving Average.

The question now isn’t if XRP will reach new heights, but how far it can go. Recently, Ripple has exhibited a massive increase in its market cap. Fantom (FTM) and DTX Exchange (DTX) are poised to give tough competition to Ripple with their explosive potential and high investment appeal. Experts claim these altcoins will outperform Ripple soon. Ripple Rally Continues: XRP MarketCap Explodes In terms of market capitalization, XRP, the native token of the Ripple network, has surpassed Tether (USDT) to take the third-largest spot. Due to a 238% price surge since early November, XRP's market capitalization has increased to almost $137.83 billion. Donald Trump was re-elected, and it is expected that his administration will enact crypto-friendly legislation. This coincides with the price increase of XRP. Additionally, considering Ripple's continuing legal disputes with the SEC, investor confidence has been bolstered by the imminent resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Ripple’s strategic initiatives, including the planned launch of its USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, have further enhanced market sentiment. Approved by the New York Department of Financial Services, RLUSD positions Ripple to compete directly with established stablecoins like USDT and USDC. XRP’s recent surge solidifies its status as one of the most resilient and promising cryptocurrencies in the market. The potential for a more favorable regulatory climate under the Trump administration could open new doors for Ripple and its native token, paving the way for expanded use cases and broader acceptance. Adding to the excitement is the growing buzz around a possible XRP-focused ETF, which could attract significant institutional capital and propel mainstream adoption. This meteoric rise is not just about price gains—it’s a testament to the crypto market’s resilience and its ability to adapt and thrive despite challenges. With a shifting regulatory environment and relentless innovation, XRP appears positioned for yet another historic breakout. Fantom (FTM) Price Surges as Whale Accumulation Intensifies Fantom (FTM) is drawing significant attention as one of the day’s top gainers, with its value surging 133.04% over the past 30 days. This impressive growth is supported by a strengthening trend, as indicated by the ADX climbing sharply to 35.6, signaling strong momentum behind the uptrend. The increasing accumulation of whales, with large holders rising from 69 to 79 since November 25, further shows the growing confidence in Fantom’s (FTM) potential. The ADX for Fantom (FTM) has risen to 35.6, up from 28 the previous day, indicating a strengthening trend in the market. The increase suggests that the momentum behind Fantom’s (FTM) price action is growing, and the trend is becoming more established. This upward movement in ADX reflects heightened market participation and conviction, reinforcing the idea that Fantom (FTM) is in a decisive phase of trending activity, likely upward based on recent price behavior. The recent rise in Fantom (FTM) whales also signals an upcoming price increase. That happens because their sustained interest and buying activity may drive scarcity and higher demand, positively impacting Fantom (FTM) price. Enthusiasts Inject Millions And Go Crazy Over This $0.12 Crypto DTX Exchange (DTX) has become the new favorite crypto among the community as it prepares to enter the $10 million milestone after selling over 24% of the total circulating supply of presale stage 6. According to expert crypto analysts, DTX Exchange (DTX) is poised to sell at a higher price in its upcoming presale round, signaling a potential breakout in its price action. The early DTX investors are already enjoying massive gains in this bull run. This hybrid platform boosts the trading potential with up to 1,000x leverage on select assets.

37304208,https://blockworks.co/news/trump-picks-crypto-czar,1733517000,Podcaster David Sacks cinches top crypto job in Trump Administration,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday evening announced his pick for the new AI and crypto czar position: David Sacks. Sacks, one of Trump’s most vocal and influential supporters in Silicon Valley, is closely tied with administration insiders, including Vice President-elect JD Vance and tech billionaire Elon Musk. Vance has called Sacks one of his “closest friends in the tech world.” Sacks made a name for himself at PayPal — co-founded by Musk, Peter Thiel and others — in the early 2000s. The three are all members of the so-called “PayPal mafia,” a group of former employees and founders who went on to create and invest in major tech companies like YouTube and OpenAI. Sacks then went south for a brief stint in Hollywood, during which he produced Thank You for Smoking, a satirical comedy based on the novel by Christopher Buckley. When he returned to Northern California he founded Yammer, a workplace communications platform later acquired by Microsoft, and venture capital firm Craft Ventures. And then (in what should come as a shock to no one), he started a podcast during the Covid pandemic. “All-In” is co-hosted by fellow VCs Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis and David Friedberg. “David Sacks is the very best of America — a successful entrepreneur, a principled free speech absolutist and a brilliant technologist,” Palihapitiya wrote on X Thursday. “He will make sure the US stays at the forefront of AI and crypto — two of the most consequential technological movements in history.” So there’s his resume. As for this new job, Trump said Thursday Sacks will “guide policy for the administration in [AI] and cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness.” His objective? Make “America the clear global leader in both areas.” Sounds like a tall order. On the crypto side, Sacks is expected to be the driving force behind what the Trump Administration has promised will be a new era of digital asset regulation. Trump added on Thursday that Sacks will be working on a “legal framework” for the industry that will help provide the “ clarity ” many execs have been requesting. It’s unclear yet whether Sacks will have a staff of advisers, but we expect he will. I’d imagine stakeholders in both the crypto and AI industries are already vying for a seat at Sacks’ table. As for the AI-crypto combo, the decision to make one czar in charge of policy recommendations isn’t shocking, but I’ll be curious how it plays out. These two facets of the broader technology sector are often lumped together , especially as both continue to grow and raise new regulatory questions . But they are two distinct industries nonetheless. We’ll be watching. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

Cardano (ADA) and DTX Exchange (DTX) are the leading cryptos in this bull cycle, rising above 300%. Experts predict that further developments in Cardano (ADA) will push the price higher, while the coming launch of DTX Exchange can skyrocket its token price. Cardano (ADA) Price Rises Amid New Development Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (ADA), highlighted a major achievement during the recent Hydra Doom testing with the community. Cardano successfully processed over 134,000 transactions per second (TPS), a significant step forward in its development. Hoskinson shared his excitement on X, posting a screenshot showing 134,464 TPS. Cardano (ADA) is one of the fastest proof-of-stake (PoS) layer-1 protocols. While it already boasts strong scalability, the Input-Output Global team introduced the Hydra Head protocol to further enhance its scalability and throughput. According to DeFiLlama, Cardano (ADA)’s total value locked (TVL) has surged alongside bullish market sentiment. The blockchain added over $400 million, reaching $680 million. This marks a remarkable recovery from its 2022 low of around $50 million. These advancements have laid a solid foundation for Cardano (ADA)'s continued growth and strengthened its position as a key player in the crypto industry. DTX Exchange (DTX) Prepares For Parabolic Breakout DTX Exchange is gaining attraction as one of the best-emerging altcoins in the crypto world. This project competes with big names in the exchange industry, including Coinbase and Binance, not only crypto but because of its hybrid nature; users can trade stocks, forex, etc. DTX Exchange is the one-stop solution for all kinds of trading, whether scalpers or positional traders. It has specific tools for every trading style. With 1,000x leverage, traders' profit potential increases significantly. Security is a major concern for decentralized exchanges because of the hacks and thefts. However, DTX Exchange has been approved by SolidProof, one of the best auditing firms. This increases investors' confidence in the exchange and shows its high focus on security. DTX Exchange doesn’t require any KYC verification for registration on the platform because of the decentralization. So, those who want to trade without any trouble going through messy KYC procedures can sign up on DTX Exchange without any hassle. DTX Exchange raised $9.5 million in its presale stage just weeks before its launch. Currently, in the sixth stage, its undervalued price provides an investment opportunity that could generate great returns as the platform launches in the main exchanges. Because of the early presale phase, investors can acquire DTX tokens at an undervalued price of $0.12 per token Learn more: Buy Presale Visit DTX Website Join The DTX Community Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Avalanche (AVAX): Eco-Friendly Blockchain with High TPS and Fast Finality Avalanche is a Layer-1 blockchain known for its eco-friendly approach, low fees, and fast transactions. It can process up to 4,500 transactions per second, aiming for transaction finality in less than 2 seconds. Avalanche allows users to create customizable Subnets, which are unique blockchains tailored for specific needs. Its native token, AVAX, is used for transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and operating Subnets. AVAX has strong utility in payments, staking, and enables the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. In the current market cycle, AVAX's technology and features may make it an attractive option for users and developers seeking a scalable and efficient blockchain solution. Fantom (FTM): A High-Speed, Scalable Smart Contract Platform Fantom (FTM) is an open-source decentralized platform for digital assets and decentralized applications (DApps). It aims to overcome limitations of previous blockchains by balancing scalability, security, and decentralization. Fantom uses its own consensus mechanism called Lachesis, which enables thousands of transactions per second with settlement times of 1-2 seconds and low transaction costs. The platform supports smart contracts through its Opera layer, which is compatible with Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM). Fantom's native token, FTM, powers the ecosystem by facilitating payments, network fees, staking, and governance. The technology offers potential for decentralized finance (DeFi) and could appeal to developers and users seeking efficient blockchain solutions. JasmyCoin: Empowering Personal Data Control with IoT and Blockchain JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency from Tokyo-based IoT provider Jasmy Corporation. It integrates Internet of Things technology with blockchain to give users full control over their personal data. The platform connects service providers and data users, enabling secure, trustless data exchange between devices like computers, cars, and phones. Jasmy aims to create an environment where data becomes a personal asset, stored securely using edge computing and IPFS. By decentralizing data ownership, it allows users to benefit from their own information while service providers offer services using user-owned data. The coin's focus on data sovereignty and secure IoT integration presents potential in the current market cycle. AVA Token: Inspired by Ava, Thailand's Rare Golden Tiger Cub Ava is a rare golden tiger cub from Thailand, known for her unique golden coat resulting from recessive genes; fewer than 100 golden tigers exist worldwide. Her growing internet fame has led to the creation of AVA Token, a community-driven cryptocurrency project. AVA Token is currently available on decentralized exchanges and seeks to harness the momentum of Ava's popularity during the current altcoin season. The project draws parallels with the recent success of MOODENG, which experienced significant gains. With plans for future listings on centralized exchanges, AVA Token presents potential in the current market cycle for those interested in emerging digital assets linked to viral phenomena. Conclusion Though AVAX, FTM, JASMY, and AVA have less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering a 700% ROI in its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and with governance, incentives, and staking features, it unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers to join the fight by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens.

Amid the highly volatile crypto landscape that includes Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), the new crypto stands out with its advanced hybrid trading platform, providing an ideal blend of decentralized and centralized exchange features. Since the DeFi token is one of the best coins to invest in, market experts believe it can potentially deliver 50x profits in this bull cycle. Experienced SOL and ADA investors are diversifying into the new Ethereum DeFi coin due to its massive growth potential. Why DTX Leads the Best Crypto Coins to Invest in This Bull Market DTX Exchange is among the top altcoins in the crypto market despite being in its public presale phase. Being one of the best coins to invest in, DTX was among the major winners in the November 2024 bull market, recording over $9.4 million in presale funding. Although SOL and ADA recorded significant growth, the gains do not match DTX Exchange’s growth potential. Therefore, this new Ethereum DeFi coin will keep dominating the bull market despite the surge of established tokens. DTX Exchange exploded into the limelight by offering a unique investment concept and impressive market performance despite being in its presale phase. The project comprises a hybrid trading platform that has attracted many investors looking for the perfect CEX and DEX blend. Investors can access more than 120,000 asset classes on the platform. Additionally, this platform’s ability to create investment opportunities with a remarkable 1000x leverage and no-KYC policy attracts users who value their privacy and are looking for highly lucrative investments. On that note, a renowned YouTube analyst, Andrew, predicted that DTX will reach a price of $1 after it gets listed on the mainstream market. Also, market analysts say the new Ethereum DeFi coin will gain 50x when trading starts in the mainstream markets. The massive growth potential has attracted many SOL and ADA investors who want increased market gains. Thus, the new crypto could be one of the best crypto coins to invest in. SOL’s Resilience and Growth Highlight Its Long-Term Potential Solana has dominated the current bull run, flipping BNB along the way. SOL is among the best coins to invest in today since its long-term potential remains bullish. SOL’s price has gained almost 35% on the monthly chart, according to CoinGecko. At one point during the bullish momentum, the token hit a new ATH of $263. Additionally, the ecosystem recorded milestones as the monthly trading volumes exceeded $109 billion. The impressive growth translated to a 108% profit from October's $52.49 billion, according to DeFiLlama. Nonetheless, SOL has encountered a pullback recently as bears have dominated the market since the beginning of December 2024. Currently, Solana is trading above its 30-day EMA ($219). Moreover, the momentum indicator’s 0.83 value highlights that the bullish momentum will continue in the coming weeks. SOL was trading at $224 on December 2, 2024, down 9.74% in the past week. Analysts say SOL will rebound to trade at $252.11 this month. Despite the expected rebound, analysts say this new Ethereum DeFi coin, DTX, could deliver 50x profit. ADA’s Adoption Grows as Whales Accumulate and Price Gains Momentum IntoTheBlock’s most recent on-chain data reported a remarkable uptick in network activity, with more than 840,000 transactions recorded recently, generating cumulative fees of 279,000 ADA. The significant growth in usage mirrors levels last seen in March 2022. Hence, there is growing interest and accelerated adoption within Cardano’s ecosystem. Cardano has been one of the best crypto coins to invest in this bull market. It reclaimed the critical $1 mark. During the recent minor pullback, ADA whales bought over 130 million tokens worth nearly $130 million. Zooming out, Cardano whales holding over $10 million worth of token holdings increased their holdings by an impressive 146%. ADA’s market signals show the token is bullish, valued at $1.11 on December 2, 2024, gaining 7.23% in the past week. Market analysts say the Cardano coin will rise to $1.36 in December. Nonetheless, investors are also buying $FXG, a new Ethereum DeFi coin, DTX, that will deliver 50x profits this bull cycle. DTX Exchange: The New Ethereum DeFi Coin Poised for 50x Growth As the crypto market maintains its bullish trajectory, DTX Exchange (DTX), a new Ethereum DeFi coin, emerges as a standout project. Being one of the best crypto coins to invest in, DTX promises unparalleled growth potential. While Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) have enhanced their positions as top altcoins, DTX’s advanced hybrid trading platform and privacy-first features make it a great option for investors looking for exponential profits. DTX is available for purchase in Stage 6 of its public presale, valued at $0.12, a 400% increase from its initial price of $0.02. Furthermore, Stage 6 investors will enjoy a 100% profit after the new crypto coin completes the presale and launches on mainstream exchanges at $0.20. Its growth potential makes it one of the best coins to invest in today.

While TRX approaches significant price landmarks, market analysts are buzzing about DOGEN's potential for a faster, monumental rise from just fractions of a cent to five dollars. What’s driving these bold predictions? Discover the forces propelling these digital assets into the limelight. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. 💎 HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market 💎 This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! ⚡️ Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? ⚡️ DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! 🚀 TRON (TRX) Surges Over 190%, Eyes Breakout Beyond $0.26 Resistance TRON (TRX) has skyrocketed, gaining over 190% in the past six months. Trading between $0.19 and $0.22, it's nearing the key resistance at $0.23. A breakout above this level could push TRX toward $0.26, the next resistance point. With a one-month price increase exceeding 100%, momentum is strong. The RSI is neutral around 48, indicating potential for further gains. Although the MACD is slightly negative, the bullish trend persists. As altcoin season approaches, TRX could climb higher, possibly surpassing previous highs. The nearest support at $0.18 provides a solid base for continued upward movement. Conclusion With the 2024 bull run underway, TRX and others have less short-term potential than DOGEN. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, DOGEN expects 700% growth by presale end, with potential thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

37304145,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51511,1733516114,Win Big with the Best Meme Coins to Buy This Month: BTFD Coin Presale Hits $1.1M as Dogwifhat Targets 226% Gains and Cheems Thrives!,"What if the next meme coin boom could be your golden ticket to life-changing returns? Meme coins like Dogwifhat (WIF), Cheems (CHEEMS), and the rising star, BTFD Coin (BTFD) , are turning heads across the crypto market with their explosive potential. With Dogwifhat forecasting a jaw-dropping 226% surge and Cheems cementing its presence in the top exchanges, the spotlight now shifts to BTFD Coin—a new-generation meme token rewriting the rules of investment with its groundbreaking presale. The BTFD presale has already raised over $1.1 million in under 10 days, selling 25 billion tokens to more than 2,700 eager investors. With its presale price set at just $0.000064 and a launch price of $0.0006, this coin offers a chance to secure returns at nearly 10x once listed. BTFD is more than just a token; it’s a rallying cry for those ready to seize the dip and turn the tide. Let’s explore what makes BTFD, Dogwifhat, and Cheems the best meme coins to buy this month. BTFD Coin: The Dip-Lover’s Dream Investment Imagine this: You’re in on a project before the market surges, bagging tokens at dip prices. That’s precisely what BTFD Coin promises to early investors through its blazing presale, now in its 7th stage. The BTFD mantra—”Buy The F***ing Dip”—is more than just crypto slang; it’s a rallying cry for savvy investors who know the market rewards bold moves. Why BTFD Coin Matters Built on Ethereum, BTFD combines decentralisation, scalability, and robust security to ensure a seamless experience for its users. But what sets it apart is its vibrant community, the “Bulls Squad.” Whether it’s staking rewards, the upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, or presale perks, BTFD knows how to keep the excitement rolling. The presale has already raised over $1.1 million in under 10 days, selling more than 25 billion BTFD tokens to over 2,700 investors. At just $0.000064 per token, Stage 7 offers a golden opportunity to secure your bag before the price skyrockets to $0.0006 post-presale. Investor Scenario Let’s say you invest $1,500 in Stage 7. At $0.000064 per token, you’d bag a whopping 23.4 million tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006, your $1,500 turns into an incredible $14,040. Sounds like a no-brainer, right? With staking rewards boasting a 90% APY, the P2E game launch in Stage 5, and locked liquidity for three years, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement designed for growth. Whether you’re a newbie or a seasoned trader, this coin screams potential. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Meme Coin with Bullish Momentum Dogwifhat has quickly become a favourite on the Solana blockchain, capturing the crypto community’s imagination with its eye-popping gains. Currently trading at $3, WIF has soared by 7% in the past week and an impressive 62% over the last month. Analysts at CoinCodex predict that WIF could reach a staggering $10.77 by January 2025, marking a 226% growth. WIF’s rise is fuelled by a perfect storm of bullish sentiment and market demand. Over the past 30 days, the coin has recorded 16 out of 30 green days, with a 14.41% price volatility. Combined with an Extreme Greed rating (84) on the Fear & Greed Index, the stage is set for WIF’s continued climb. While WIF’s momentum is strong, its high volatility makes it a thrilling, albeit risky, bet for investors. For those with a taste for adventure, this coin could be the ticket to substantial short-term gains. Cheems (CHEEMS): A Meme Legacy with Real Utility Cheems isn’t just a meme—it’s an icon. Born from internet culture and immortalised as a cryptocurrency, CHEEMS has seen a surge in interest following its recent developments. This meme coin is now featured on Binance’s futures market, offering up to 75x leverage, and it recently landed on Bitget’s Innovation Zone. These moves have solidified CHEEMS as a key player in the meme coin space. Trading at $0.00071727, analysts predict the coin could rise by 220.83% to $0.00083556 by the year’s end. Cheems also honours its origins, paying tribute to Balltze, the Shiba Inu dog who inspired its creation. As a community-driven token, it continues to innovate while capturing the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. Whether you’re a fan of its nostalgic roots or its bullish future, CHEEMS has a unique charm. Why BTFD Coin Stands Out While Dogwifhat and Cheems are solid meme coin picks, BTFD Coin offers unparalleled potential for early investors. With a 173 billion token cap, staking rewards, and a vibrant community, this coin has all the ingredients to shine. Its presale structure, featuring 16 stages with escalating prices, ensures early adopters are handsomely rewarded. As the BTFD P2E game approaches its launch, excitement is building. Add in Ethereum’s scalability and locked liquidity, and it’s clear BTFD is more than a meme—it’s a movement. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Best Meme Coins to Buy This Month Meme coins aren’t just internet jokes anymore; they’re opportunities to make real money. With Dogwifhat’s 226% forecast, Cheems’ expanding utility, and BTFD Coin’s presale dominance, there’s no shortage of exciting options. But if you’re looking for the most bang for your buck, BTFD Coin is the one to watch. With its 7th-stage presale pricing at $0.000064, staking rewards, and the promise of exponential growth, this is your chance to buy the dip and ride the wave. Don’t wait—join the BTFD Coin presale today and claim your spot among the Bulls Squad!

More than 23 billion BTFD coins have already been sold, and with over 2,400 coin holders, the community surrounding this project is growing rapidly. As the presale moves forward, demand is expected to rise, potentially driving prices up significantly. Those who act now could experience substantial gains when the coin officially launches. A Thriving Community: The Heart of BTFD But what makes BTFD more than just a presale success? It’s the fact that BTFD isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a movement.

37302995,https://crypto.news/?p=14316935,1733515889,"Emerging markets, AI, and crypto: insights from Ryze Labs’ Matthew Graham","In an exclusive interview at the Emergence Conference in Prague, Matthew Graham, founder and CEO of Ryze Labs, shares his insights on the next frontier of AI and crypto adoption. In the ever-evolving landscape of crypto and artificial intelligence, few voices are as bold and influential as Matthew Graham, founder of Ryze Labs. Based in Shanghai, Graham and Ryze Labs venture to fund bleeding edge companies at the intersection of crypto and AI, operating with a mission to drive innovation in emerging markets by virtue of aligning talent with capital. The company’s portfolio is companies including alt-L1s, such as Polygon and Sui , in addition to investments in infrastructure through companies like Layer Zero and Builders Tribe, as well as several DApps and gaming/metaverse companies that lean into web3. Additionally, Ryze Labs has taken a strong position in Solana’s ecosystem by acquiring MNDE tokens through Marinade, the leading Solana staking protocol, reflecting confidence in Solana’s SVM framework, staking advancements, and PayFi applications. For the TON blockchain, Graham also made an investment into Telegram’s vast 900 million-strong user base, which serves as a foundation for building the next Web3 super app, reinforcing his fund’s commitment to backing projects with transformative potential across diverse ecosystems. On the potential of AI , Graham highlighted what he says are unique opportunities in emerging markets, as well as the next wave of potential for blockchain entrepreneurs.

Ryze Labs and a16z partner with Shaw on AI Combinator Earlier this year Ryze launched an AI Combinator together with Shaw and a16z, which Graham hopes will become a hub for AI and blockchain developers to collaborate, exchange ideas, and accelerate progress. “We’ve already made 10 to 12 investments at this intersection,” Graham said, noting that the incubator has a $5 million fund it aims to deploy across sectors. Participants in the AI Combinator receive early access to groundbreaking features in the Eliza framework, an essential tool for building interactive AI agents deployed by a16z, as well as mentorship by Graham and others. “The possibilities of AI in crypto are vast, ranging from automating tasks with varying levels of intelligence to creating AI agents that influence and inspire real-world human actions,” Graham said. “I think it’s less likely that you will have AI innovation with AI agents specific to some kind of L1, designed just for that L1.” Graham stressed. Instead, we are “likely to see a stack that includes a layer which is designed for AI agents that sits atop multiple L1s, as a middle layer.” “Our superpower,” Graham was keen to stress, “is helping our portfolio companies to enter these unique markets.” The catalyst for growth will be in emerging markets Emerging markets, he noted, are one area Graham sees as poised for growth. “These markets are where the next wave of users and builders will come from,” he said, highlighting the need for tailored support to navigate regulatory, cultural, and technological challenges in jurisdictions far from major crypto nerve centers like New York, San Francisco, Zug or London, Graham has turned to global hubs like Lagos and Bangalore to search for talent and the next AI/crypto unicorns. Drawing parallels to cultural phenomena like internet memes and lore, he noted how despite geographic barriers, internet lore and culture can synergize movements across time and space. Terminal of Truths – a ‘stop everything moment’ “Lore becomes really important to the success of these innovations,” he said, referencing projects that creatively integrate AI with cultural and historical narratives. Take for example the Terminal of Truths , an AI agent founded by Andy Ayreythat that garnered significant interest earlier this year for combining the lore of the Goatsee meme, together with an X account and a Solana wallet. That project was given $50,000 in funding from a16z’s Marc Andreessen, which flicked a switch in Graham’s thinking about the potential of AI agents to work across the crypto ecosystem. “Ultimately, our goal is to back the hell out of people building the most exciting projects at the intersection of AI and crypto,” Matthew said. “When I learned about Terminal of Truths, that was a stop-everything moment. The convergence of AI and crypto is not just a trend; it’s the next frontier.” Read more: Trump pick David Sacks as White House’s AI and crypto czar",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MATIC | SOL,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/emerging-markets-ai-and-crypto-insights-from-ryze-labs-matthew-graham/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37302995.jpeg

According to an official release , Semler Scientific bought 303 BTC between November 25 and December 4 at an average price of $96,779 per bitcoin, including fees and expenses. The company made the purchases using proceeds generated from its at-the-market shares offering. Semler Announces New BTC Purchase Following the latest purchase, Semler said it had spent $147.1 million to acquire its bitcoins at an average of $78,553 per asset. At bitcoin’s current price of $98,450, the stash is worth more than $184.39 million. When BTC rallied above $103,000 on December 5, Semler’s portfolio was valued at over $192 million. Currently, the healthcare provider has unrealized profits of up to $37.29 million. The company revealed that its BTC yield was 54.7% from October 1 to December 4, representing remarkable quarter-to-date growth. Since July 1, 2024, the quarter after Semler Scientific adopted its Bitcoin treasury strategy, the firm’s BTC yield has amounted to 78.7%. Semler’s chairman, Eric Semler, said: “We are very pleased to report BTC Yield of 78.7%. In addition, we have requested approval from the options exchanges to allow options trading in our stock as we believe we satisfy their eligibility requirements.” The 14th Largest Public BTC Holder Since Semler Scientific embraced Bitcoin seven months ago, the company has periodically purchased the leading cryptocurrency. These purchases have been funded with proceeds from the sales of its common stock. The last BTC acquisition was in mid-November, and the move added 297 BTC to Semler’s bitcoin balance sheet, bringing its stash to 1,570 BTC. With the most recent purchase having increased the company’s bitcoin portfolio to 1,873 BTC, Semler is now the 14th largest public company holding bitcoin, per data from BitBo’s Bitcoin treasuries site. Meanwhile, Semler Scientific is not the only company recently acquiring BTC rapidly. The business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, the largest publicly traded BTC holder, announced it had increased its stash to 402,100 earlier this week after acquiring 15,400 bitcoins worth roughly $1.5 billion.

The world’s largest digital currency has seen a meteoric rise since Donald Trump won the elections, and investors had been waiting for the cryptocurrency to jet past the $100K mark. BTC started the week over $95K, and traded in a narrow range till Wednesday. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) touched the long awaited milestone as Trump’s pick of crypto backer, Paul Atkins as the SEC chair on Wednesday played the catalyst in pushing it past the mark. The cryptocurrency, however, fell below the mark on Thursday. “If Donald Trump's plan to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve is implemented and other countries quickly follow suit, it would significantly increase overall demand for Bitcoin. This could make Bitcoin worth $400,000 per coin within the next 5 years,” said Seeking Alpha analyst Kennan Mell . Click here to know what other Seeking Alpha analysts are saying as Bitcoin traded above $100K. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is up a whopping 132% in a year. ""As long as Bitcoin maintains this close—over $100k—going into the end of this week, we would expect that it continues to run higher, and could easily see it between $110k and $120k this month and going into next year,"" Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin financial services firm, said. With the cryptocurrency’s rise, it is becoming one of the most prominent ""Trump trades"" in the aftermath of the 2024 election. Since the polls, Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) price has jumped ~50%, as it benefits from rise in demand, increase in ETF inflows and a positive investor sentiment fuelled by Trump’s win. Wednesday also saw robust inflows into the spot BTC ETFs with $556.8 million coming in as net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. ""As we look ahead, Bitcoin's potential for growth remains significant, especially as institutions recognize it as a reliable store of value and increasingly invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Additionally, we anticipate interest in Ethereum ETFs and the forthcoming approval of Solana and Ripple ETFs, which will further diversify institutional portfolios,"" said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. Companies such as MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) have also been on a Bitcoin purchasing spree, and more companies have been looking to join the bandwagon, leading to a rise in corporate adoption of the cryptocurrency. Institutional flows into Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) are expected to continue in 2025, which would make the cryptocurrency reach $200,000 by the end of next year, said Geoff Kendrick, head of Crypto Research at Standard Chartered Bank, in a note. ""I think the prospects for next year also look excellent, though this depends a lot more on whether we get the strategic Bitcoin reserve and other political outcomes, with some these outcomes potentially sending Bitcoin into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per coin,” Klippsten added. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) market cap now stands at $1.97 trillion. ""Technical analysis would point to about 120K as the next immediate resistance, and we would expect to see more major altcoins start to outperform in the near term as the FOMO appetite spreads out,"" said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SOFA. Notable News CleanSpark ( CLSK ) mined 622 bitcoins in November , while Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ) Wednesday said that it mined 39 Bitcoin in the month . Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) produced 495 Bitcoin in November . MARA mined 26.7% more Bitcoin in the month. MARA ( MARA ) said it will acquire a wind farm in Hansford County, Texas. The firm announced the pricing of its offering of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2031. Nano Labs ( NA ) said it plans to purchase and hold $50 million worth of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) over the next five years. The U.S. will likely approve cryptocurrency legislation ""fairly quickly"" after crypto-friendly Donald Trump becomes president, Coinbase's ( COIN ) policy chief Faryar Shirzad told CNBC. Coinbase ( COIN ) added Apple Pay ( AAPL ) for all fiat-to- crypto purchases to its Onramp product for onboarding to crypto, as it seeks to streamline what can be a cumbersome process.

37302791,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390336,1733515477,"Cardano (ADA) Poised for 30% Rally, Here’s Why","The post Cardano (ADA) Poised for 30% Rally, Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, is poised to continue its upward momentum as it has formed a bullish price action pattern. After experiencing significant gains, ADA appears to be consolidating within a tight range near the strong resistance level of $1.25 and is struggling to break through this level. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level During this ongoing consolidation, CoinPedia’s technical analyst found a bullish flag and pole price action pattern in four hours. Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks this pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $1.25 level, it could potentially soar by 30% to reach the $1.63 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View At present, the asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54, which is below the overbought zone, indicating that ADA still has room to rally in the coming days. The RSI is a technical indicator used to determine whether an asset is in an overbought or oversold zone, helping traders and investors make informed decisions. $98.4 Million of ADA Outflow From Exchanges Based on this bullish technical analysis, it appears that investors and whales have shown strong interest in the altcoin, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA’s spot inflow/outflow indicates that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $98.37 million worth of ADA. Source: Coinglass This significant outflow indicates that whales, institutions, or retail investors collectively moved substantial amounts of ADA from exchanges to their wallets. Historically, such activity on exchanges often hints at upside momentum, presents a potential buying opportunity, and reduces the likelihood of a price decline. Combining these on-chain metrics with technical analysis suggests that bulls are currently in control, which could support ADA in breaking through the $1.25 resistance level. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is currently trading near $1.22 and has registered a price gain of 1.5% in the past 24 hours. However, its trading volume has dropped by 20% during the same period, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardano-ada-poised-for-30-rally-heres-why/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Solana (SOL): A High-Performance Blockchain for Scalable Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability and speed, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. It stands out by enabling faster transactions without relying on sharding or second-layer solutions. Solana's native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, powering programs, and rewarding network participants. The platform supports development across multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. With its high-capacity network designed for hosting high-activity products and services, Solana has potential in the blockchain space. In the current market cycle, its emphasis on scalability and performance makes it a noteworthy option for developers and users interested in decentralized applications. XRP: A Fast, Decentralized Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to enable fast, low-cost, and borderless transactions. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, XRP ensures secure and irreversible transfers without the need for a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for development. Ripple uses XRP to enhance network liquidity, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP's efficient technology and potential for widespread adoption may make it an attractive option for users. Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable Blockchain with High Scalability Cardano is a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts for decentralized apps, tokens, and games. Its cryptocurrency, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH, allowing users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses a more energy-efficient method called proof-of-stake, making it more sustainable than platforms that use proof-of-work. The blockchain is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts, improving its speed and scalability. This design enables it to potentially process up to a million transactions per second. Introduced in 2021, Cardano's tokens offer secure and low-fee interactions. With these features, ADA has strong potential in the current market cycle. Conclusion While SOL, XRP, and ADA show limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out.

37302667,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373792,1733515245,First Time Since March: ETH Price Skyrockets Past $4K as ETF Demand Rises,"ETH has finally joined the bull party as its price shot up to over $4,000 for the first time since March this year. This spectacular surge comes on the heels of the growing interest and demand for the spot Ethereum ETFs, as Thursday was the best day ever in terms of net inflows. ETHUSD. Source: TradingView On the day the US presidential elections were decided – November 6 – ETH’s price struggled at around $2,500. The rest of the market was in anticipation of the results but once it became clear that Trump will be the next POTUS, BTC and most alts exploded. Ethereum also went up but remained in the shadow of bitcoin and many altcoins, such as XRP , DOGE, XLM, TRX, SOL, and even BNB at one point. Many of those charted fresh all-time highs, while others went to multi-year peaks. ETH couldn’t keep up, and its price stood within a tight range between $3,000 and $3,400 for a few weeks. However, its moment finally arrived in the past week or so as the second-largest digital asset shot up by 14% within this timeframe. Moreover, ETH is up by more than 6% in the past 24 hours alone. This helped it surpass the coveted $4,000 level for the first time since March this year. It climbed to nearly $4,100 minutes ago and now remains inches below that level. Perhaps the most probable reason behind this impressive rally is the change in dynamics around the spot Ethereum ETFs. The financial vehicles struggled for months to attract investors’ attention, especially when compared to their BTC counterparts, but the landscape is entirely different now. The Ethereum ETFs registered their best day to date on December 5, as they saw $428.5 million in net inflows. This broke the previous record from November 29 of $332.9 million. BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack, with $292.7 million, followed by Fidelity’s FETH ($113.6 million).

37302958,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624052,1733515231,Pump.fun restricts traders from the UK after FCA warning,"At the peak of its popularity, Pump.fun is facing more scrutiny and questions on its risk profile. Reports are emerging of UK users seeing a restriction screen, as a centralized protection against using the high-volatility launch and trading platform. Pump.fun access is showing a restriction screen for users in the United Kingdom. The new restriction follows the recent shutdown of the live-streaming feature, where some of the streams escaped moderation. The restriction originates with the site itself but follows a warning from the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. According to the FCA, the firm provides unauthorized financial services and users should refrain from using it. There is no outright ban on trading meme tokens, but the FCA warns traders are not covered by the UK Financial Ombudsman authority. There are currently no other sanctions against Pump.fun or token traders or creators. Around 9% of the site’s traffic comes from the UK, with more than 30% from the leading market, the USA. The token launch platform faced the restriction also in relation to its extreme risk. Reports of the ban arrived after podcaster Hailey Welch rug-pulled her own HAWK token for $50M. Whatever the final reason, Pump.fun is now posting a ‘restricted jurisdiction’ notice for anyone attempting to connect from the UK. Potential token traders found a workaround for the connection validity test, bypassing the restriction . Pump.fun itself has no stated office location or jurisdiction. The protocol is merely software communicating with the Solana network, offering a basic safeguard against rug pulls by locking up initial liquidity. Despite this, tokens remain risky, as developers can still own a share of the supply and sell it quickly, creating a big loss for all other buyers. Pump.fun has not included the UK in its restricted list For now, Pump.fun has not altered its terms and conditions, and the UK is featured as one of the regulated and permitted crypto markets. The conditions in fact take into account UK regulations for other countries and territories. Pump.fun retains a restriction risk that is shared by other crypto platforms. The official list of prohibited countries includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Russia. The restriction follows the limitation for Polymarket in France after the app became notorious for its large-scale payouts for bets on the US election results. In the case of Pump.fun, an actual ban has not been passed by UK authorities. Reddit supporters of Solana showed relief about the restriction, suggesting the site may have to be banned by state authorities. For now, the Pump.fun team has decided on self-restricting by excluding users as much as possible, though the site is not restricting VPN usage or restriction bypassing. Pump.fun is also fully a non-KYC site, with no way to check user identities. Pump.fun trading slows down The meme token season from the past three months is coming down from its stage of endless expansion. The market for new risky tokens peaked in late November. Enthusiasm for memes cooled down a notch after Pump.fun stopped its live-streaming feature, due to being unable to moderate all content. The site already peaked in its number of daily new tokens. During the most active trading days, more than 261K active wallets joined the trading, with a small fraction acting as token creators. Pump.fun daily revenues peaked at $5.3M as of November 24, the high water mark for the meme cycle. Fees have since fallen to $1.5M daily, as all other metrics are also shifting. Pump.fun token creation peaked in November, with users and fees slowing down in December. | Source: Dune Analytics The last few weeks contained multiple new trends and rug pulls, including the QUANT token trend, where a 13-year-old creator launched and rug-pulled his own tokens. Even without those dramatic events, Pump.fun tokens usually fail and remain stuck in more than 98% of all launches. However, some tokens make it big, as in the case of Moodeng (MOODENG), which gained a listing on Coinbase as one of the few shortlisted memes. Pump.fun also set the example for other similar platforms, such as SunPump on TRON, or the recently launched SpringBoard by PancakeSwap.

37302612,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658395,1733515215,Cardano Whales Keep Buying – Price Holds Above Crucial Mark,"Cardano (ADA) has demonstrated impressive resilience, holding firmly above the critical $1.15 level since Monday despite an aggressive market shakeout triggered by Bitcoin’s volatility. While many cryptocurrencies struggled under selling pressure, ADA’s ability to maintain this support showcases its strength amid uncertain market conditions. Top analyst Ali Martinez highlighted bullish signs for Cardano, sharing data that points to a significant increase in whale activity. This uptick in large transactions indicates growing interest from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, often a precursor to substantial price movements. Related Reading: Don’t Fade Dogecoin! – Analyst Says DOGE Is About To Rally As Bitcoin’s shakeout ripples across the market, ADA’s stability above $1.15 becomes a focal point for traders and investors. If Cardano can sustain this level, it could pave the way for a bullish continuation, potentially targeting new highs. Conversely, losing this support would signal increased downside risk and likely lead to a broader consolidation phase. With ADA showing relative strength against broader market turbulence, all eyes are on its next move. Will increased whale activity and bullish sentiment drive Cardano to new heights, or will market uncertainty prevail? The coming days will be crucial in determining ADA’s direction and potential to outperform in a challenging market environment. Big Players Keep Buying Cardano Cardano has consistently set new highs and retraced to hold previous highs as support. This bullish behavior signals strong market confidence in ADA’s potential to deliver significant gains in the current cycle. Whale activity has been a key driver of this momentum, with large-scale holders of ADA significantly increasing their positions. Analyst Ali Martinez shared data on X revealing that Cardano whales have accumulated over 100 million ADA in the last 24 hours alone, valued at approximately $115 million. This surge in accumulation is a highly bullish indicator, suggesting that influential investors are positioning themselves for further upside. This activity coincides with increasing chatter about the arrival of an “alt-season,” a period when altcoins typically outperform Bitcoin and experience massive price rallies. Cardano’s solid fundamentals and growing network activity position it as a prime candidate for significant gains in such a market environment. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week? The combination of whale accumulation, robust price action, and broader market trends indicates that ADA is ready to capitalize on the potential for massive gains this cycle. Cardano appears well-prepared to stand out as the market looks to altcoins for the next big moves. Whether it can sustain this momentum will be a critical question in the coming weeks. Price Holding Above Key Level Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.16 following a 15% pullback from its recent local highs of $1.32. Despite this decline, the price remains above a crucial support level at $1.15, which could determine its next move. Holding above this level is essential for ADA to maintain its bullish momentum and signal the possibility of a renewed rally. If ADA sustains support at $1.15 in the coming days, a push toward higher supply zones is expected, potentially targeting a retest of the $1.32 level and beyond. This level has become a key battleground for bulls aiming to regain control and drive higher prices. Such a move would confirm the pullback was a healthy retracement within an ongoing uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is ‘Ready To Run Again’ – Analyst Expects 60% Rally However, failing to hold the $1.15 support could signal weakness and extend ADA’s current consolidation phase. This scenario might see the price oscillating in a range, delaying any significant upward movement. Traders and investors closely monitor this level as the broader market dynamics remain uncertain. ADA’s ability to stay above $1.15 will likely shape its short-term trajectory, making this a pivotal moment for the altcoin’s price action.

Donald’s Bitcoin (DONBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald’s Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald’s Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Donald’s Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald’s Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald’s Bitcoin by entering its contract address – CwNFbrw34737MzsYKw9gEib7o23ooZV5m8qrggXwHQde – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBTC.

XRP (XRP) XRP has experienced remarkable growth recently. In the past week, its price jumped by 64.07%. Over the past month, it surged by 379.04%, and in six months, it climbed by 384.33%. The current price ranges between $1.60 and $2.67, showing strong upward momentum. The nearest resistance level for XRP is at $3.

On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.91. The 10-day simple moving average is $2.40, slightly below the 100-day average of $2.48, suggesting that the short-term trend is aligning with the longer-term trend. Technical indicators present mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 50.84, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic oscillator reads 69.81, approaching overbought levels, which may suggest a potential pullback. The MACD level sits at -0.01244, hinting at possible bearish momentum in the short term. Based on this data, XRP might face some resistance ahead, but if it overcomes these hurdles, further gains could be on the horizon. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has shown impressive growth recently. In the past week, its price increased by 22.04%. Over the last month, the rise was even more substantial at 278.83%. Looking back six months, ADA has gained 175.06%. This upward trend highlights growing interest and confidence in the cryptocurrency. Currently, ADA's price ranges between $0.96 and $1.25. The nearest resistance level is at $1.35, and the nearest support level is at $0.77. If the price moves above $1.35, it could aim for the second resistance at $1.64, which would be an increase of about 21%. On the downside, falling below $0.77 might see support at $0.48. Technical indicators suggest continued positive momentum. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are $1.22 and $1.19, respectively, indicating a bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 59.12, suggesting the asset isn't overbought yet. A Stochastic value of 82.19 points to strong momentum, and the MACD level of 0.00846 supports a potential upward movement. Based on this data, ADA may continue its upward trajectory in the near term. TRON (TRX) TRX has experienced significant price increases recently. Over the past week, its price surged by 65.16%. In the last month, it jumped by 104.19%. Looking back six months, TRX has soared by 195.12%. These impressive gains suggest growing interest and momentum in the market. Currently, TRX is trading between $0.19 and $0.22. The nearest resistance level is at $0.23. If the price breaks through this point, it might climb towards the second resistance level at $0.26. On the other hand, the nearest support level is at $0.18, with a second support at $0.15. These levels are crucial for traders watching potential price movements. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is at $0.33, and the 100-day average is at $0.28, both above the current price. This could indicate a potential for the price to rise to meet these averages. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 48.24, suggesting that TRX is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is negative at -0.0013971, which might point to bearish momentum. However, given the strong recent performance, TRX could continue its upward trend if it surpasses key resistance levels. Conclusion While XRP, ADA, and TRX hold value, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands ready to lead altseason with its unique fusion of sports enthusiasm and meme coin appeal.

Experts are predicting that truly life-changing gains will be made for investors in the newly launching web3 casino Rollblock ($RBLK). Let's find out why incredible 50x price predictions are being made! Ethereum ($ETH) Next To Run As ETF Inflows Near $1B Ethereum has been performing well in recent days, as the Ethereum dominance has risen to 12.78%. Ethereum is up 5% on the daily timeframe, bringing the Ethereum price to $3.9k. Bitcoin's rally above $100k should push Ethereum above $4k in the days to come, as altcoins will likely run hard on such bullish momentum. Ethereum spot ETFs net inflow hit an incredible $908 million after just 95 trading days recently. These funds should reach more than $1 billion in assets under management in the weeks ahead, making Ethereum one of the best-performing institutional-grade assets in the space. New Ethereum all-time highs above $4.7k are expected within the coming quarter. Solana ($SOL) Ready To Rush Back To New Highs Solana recently lost its place as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, as Ripple surged into third position this week. Solana is currently consolidating below its previous all-time high, having broken through $258 briefly last week to set a new all-time high of $265. Solana is up 0.2% today, reaching $237. Grayscale recently announced the details of its proposed spot Solana ETF, which joins three other applications already under review by the SEC. Solana has been experiencing significant adoption, with Solana’s decentralized exchange volume recently surpassing that of Ethereum and all its layer 2 chains combined. Rollblock ($RBLK) Bringing Rewards To Token Holders As Adoption Soars Rollblock ( $RBLK ) is well placed to benefit from the recent surge in Bitcoin and Ethereum, as this up-and-coming GambleFi powerhouse will see a huge spike in adoption as the crypto asset class matures. Rollblock is fully crypto-native and powered by its native token $RBLK. All of its immersive games are powered by the latest AI technology and offer provably fairer odds than competitors, thanks to Rollblock's use of innovative blockchain tech. A sports betting league has recently gone live that will entice a whole new market of sports fans, who are ready to take a flutter on their favorite international tournaments. This will add a further revenue stream to the already lucrative platform, which is now fully live with over 7,000 casino classics to explore. Holders of $RBLK will benefit hugely from the token's deflationary tokenomics, which will trend lower over time thanks to Rollblock's revenue share scheme. This will take a portion of operating profit each week and buy back $RBLK on the order books, burning 60% of these purchases and allocating the rest to community stakers. $6.8 million has so far been pledged as stage 8 tokens are currently over 95% sold out! The $RBLK price will soon rise yet again from the current bargain floor of $0.038. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

42389689,6eec884e-14a7-487a-970b-d529f850f9cb,1733514588,Proof of Operation Chokepoint 2.0,"So, now we know. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 was real.    There really was a co-ordinated federal government effort to de-bank crypto following the collapse of three mid-sized crypto-friendly lenders (Signature, Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank) in March 2023. The crypto industry, led by VC-commentator Nic Carter, has long suspected and railed against de-banking. But, until today, we didn’t have much documentary evidence.   Friday morning, internal communications at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp were released after a research firm (History Associates Inc.) hired by Coinbase sued to get them uncovered.   “The heavily-redacted documents emerged on Friday, showing the banking regulator slamming the brakes on lenders offering or considering products and services in the digital assets sector,” CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton wrote in his report today.   ""We respectfully ask that you pause all crypto asset-related activity,"" the FDIC wrote in one of 23 internal letters released by Coinbase. ""The FDIC will notify all FDIC-supervised banks at a later date when a determination has been made on the supervisory expectations for engaging in crypto asset-related activity.""  The FDIC and other regulators have long denied they pressured the three struggling banks to stop banking crypto companies, many of which were suffering following the collapse of FTX and others in late-2022.    ""The letters show that this was no conspiracy theory at all, that this was not just rank speculation or the musings of a paranoid industry,"" Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal told Hamilton. ""There was a concerted plan on the part of the FDIC that they carried out — without any reluctance — to deny banking services to a legal American industry. That should give everyone great pause.""    Debanking has been a hot issue recently, after mega-VC Marc Andreessen discussed Operation Chokepoint 2.0 on Joe Rogan’s podcast. The House Committee on Financial Services heard testimony from several crypto leaders this week attesting to difficulties gaining banking services. The heavily redacted letters show FDIC demanding onerous compliance information while being unclear as to what was actually required of the banks before they could approve the provision of financial services to the businesses. Hamilton writes that some letters show the “agency wasn't yet sure what regulatory filings would even be required before it could green-light crypto business.”    Grewal said Coinbase will petition the court to allow the documents to be released unredacted.    Aside from hurting the crypto industry, critics argue financial services are a fundamental right and that the federal government should not be able to effectively outlaw legal businesses. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is a reference to an official Obama Administration policy to restrict financial services to payday lenders, gun sellers and other “undesirable” businesses.    It’s now clear that de-banking was as much a matter for crypto as it was for porn, which says a lot about the current administration’s attitude towards it.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/06/proof-of-operation-chokepoint-2-0,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07b9d7024737d982b345ca219a15bb2ad4f3ae89-2100x1575.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company could go public as early as the second quarter of 2025, but the timing may change, according to unnamed sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports . eToro hopes to exceed the $3.5 billion valuation it achieved during a private funding round last year. Details about the IPO, including other banks that may be involved, remain under discussion. You might also like: US Bitcoin ETFs surpass Satoshi’s slumbering stack SEC vs. eToro The platform faced regulatory issues in the U.S., settling allegations in September that it had operated as an unregistered broker. As part of the settlement, eToro agreed to pay $1.5 million and restrict cryptocurrency offerings for U.S. customers. The SEC’s complaint claimed that eToro operated as an unlicensed broker and clearing agency since at least 2020. An IPO would occur amid rising interest in cryptocurrencies, partly driven by President-elect Donald Trump’s decision to appoint a crypto-friendly businessman to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This shift could pave the way for more crypto-focused companies to go public. Bitcoin ( BTC ) prices have surged past $100,000, reflecting this renewed enthusiasm. eToro’s platform allows users to trade various assets, including cryptocurrencies, and follow the trades of successful investors.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. Creators Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer wanted a fun alternative to serious cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. They chose the popular Shiba Inu meme as the logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin is plentiful. There’s no maximum supply, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. At first, people saw it as a ""memecoin."" But in 2021, Dogecoin's value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, worth over $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin's popularity showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. Dogecoin's technology is simple and easy to use. It has fast transaction times and low fees. This makes it good for small payments and tipping online. The coin's potential lies in its strong community and widespread recognition. In the current market, Dogecoin stands out for its unique story and support from influential figures. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, it may not have advanced features like smart contracts. But its simplicity can be an advantage. With the crypto market always changing, Dogecoin could still have room to grow. Its future depends on continued community support and market trends. Conclusion Coins like DOGE are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims higher, uniting sports fans in a community-driven memecoin with potential for massive growth through its unique blend of sports and memes.

37302234,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311813,1733514347,"Bitcoin (BTC) Competes With Gold, Not the US Dollar: Fed Chair Jerome Powell","U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell thinks Bitcoin ( BTC ) is more akin to gold than the US dollar. At the New York Times DealBook summit this week, Powell was asked whether the public’s interest in BTC represents a lack of faith in the US dollar. Says the Fed chair, “I don’t think that’s how people think about it. People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset, right? It’s like gold. It’s just like gold, only it’s virtual. It’s digital. People are not using it as a form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold. That’s really how I think of it.” President-elect Donald Trump reportedly has no objections to Powell serving the remainder of his term as Fed chair until May 2026. Trump nominated Powell during his first term, but the two clashed several times, leading to the then-45th US president threatening to remove the Fed chair from office. Powell ended up keeping his post, however, and he was reappointed to a second four-year term by President Joe Biden in 2022. Bitcoin is trading at $98,013 at time of writing. The top crypto asset by market cap made headlines this week after breaking the $100,000 price barrier for several hours on Wednesday and Thursday.

DOGE Holders Also Add New DeFi Token","Dogecoin (DOGE) holders could soon receive the holiday gift they’ve been waiting for. Dogecoin’s consolidation phase seems to be drawing to a close and the coveted $1 target could soon become reality. Meanwhile, many DOGE investors have started rotating a portion of their profits into undervalued meme coins that could mimic Dogecoin’s price multipliers of the past cycles. One such gem could be Cutoshi , as its viral presale has already raised $1.28 million. Hundreds of buyers are rushing to get an allocation before the $CUTO token hits the markets. Dogecoin Is Teasing A Breakout, $0.50 Incoming? After peaking at $0.47 with nearly 200% in monthly gains, Dogecoin (DOGE) has entered a cool-off phase that allowed investors to scoop up the dip. At the time of writing, Dogecoin trades at $0.41 with little to no movement in terms of intraday price action. Daily volume has recorded a 4% uptick with roughly $9 billion worth of DOGE traded on exchanges. Crypto experts believe that a Dogecoin breakout is imminent as buying pressure continues to mount. Trader and analyst Scofield has shared a chart reading on X that shows DOGE’s movements being squeezed by ascending and descending trend lines, creating a triangle formation. This pattern is expected to culminate in a break to the upside with the first major target being the $0.50 mark. Once Doge reconsolidates around this level, bullish continuation could lead to the prophesied $1 by the end of 2024. Dogecoin Whales Lead The Charge Meanwhile, whales continue to accumulate massive amounts of DOGE. According to TradingView data, large wallets have bolstered their Dogecoin positions by adding $160 million worth of DOGE over the last weekend. This show of confidence has reignited investor sentiment as Dogecoin continues to make headlines. On the other hand, it’s safe to say that Dogecoin is already past the point of diminishing returns, as it's unrealistic to expect another 100x rally from an asset with over $60 billion in market cap. This is why savvy investors are now adding low-cap meme gems to their portfolios, with Cutoshibeing one of the best examples. What Makes Cutoshi Is Different Than Other Meme Coins Projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are outliers in the meme coin landscape. Most memes fail to become staples and tend to fade into obscurity as investors hop on the next trend. The reason is simple: they lack a real use case to ensure they can thrive in the long run. With its focus on DeFi, Cutoshi is built to thrive, not just in this current cycle, but for years to come. At the heart of the Cutoshi ecosystem is CUTO DEX, this is a decentralized exchange that allows for seamless swaps across all major blockchains. With privacy and decentralization being a crucial part of Cutoshi’s values, users will not be required to compromise sensitive data or rely on middlemen when it comes to their assets. This philosophy, Cutoshi, inherits directly from Satoshi Nakamoto, who was inspired by the same ideals when creating Bitcoin. Enter Cutoshi Farming Cutoshi has a very simple goal: to bring good fortune to its community just like the Lucky Cats of Japanese folklore are said to bring prosperity to businesses. Users who engage with the ecosystem will have the chance to earn significant monetary rewards via the Cuto Farm initiative. During and after the presale, they will be tasked to complete various missions aimed at expanding Cutoshi’s presence in crypto space. For their efforts, they will receive CUTO points that can later be exchanged for $CUTO tokens. Moreover, once the option is available, they will also have the opportunity to stake their $CUTO and earn money on autopilot. The fourth stage of the $CUTO presale is now live and the token sells for just $0.031. Once Cutoshi hits the markets, it could follow Dogecoin's footsteps and lock in for a massive moonshot in 2025.

37302132,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311878,1733514097,Haliey Welch of Hawk Tuah Fame Faces Backlash Over Alleged Memecoin Pump-and-Dump: Report,"Internet personality Haliey Welch, herself of meme fame, is facing backlash and serious accusations after the implosion of her HAWK memecoin. According to a report from the BBC, the Talk Tuah host’s Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin HAWK lost more than 95% of its value within hours after launch, prompting YouTuber Coffeezilla to accuse Welch of executing a pump-and-dump scheme. A pump-and-dump scheme artificially inflates a coin’s value through hype or misinformation. Then, holders of that coin who bought the token cheap (or got it for free), sell those tokens at a high value, crashing the price. In a copy-and-pasted statement on the social media platform X, Welch has denied any allegations of wrongdoing. “Copy and pasting: Hawkanomics: Team hasn’t sold one token and not 1 KOL (key opinion leader) was given 1 free token We tried to stop snipers as best we could through high fees in the start of launch on MeteoraAG Fees have now been dropped” Source: Haliey Welch/X However, according to a blockchain investigator and self-described “on-chain demon” who goes by the pseudonym Zeus, Welch’s claims ring untrue . “The team hasn’t sold one token:” Source: Zeus/X In a conversation with Welch on The Matt Kohrs Show, Coffeezilla told the Talk Tuah host directly that her HAWK launch constituted “the worst tokenomics I have ever seen”, accusing Welch and her team of participating in insider trading, and adding his opinion that the launch was, indeed, “a scam.” The authorities have not announced any formal investigations into the situation as of writing. However, if any of the alleged charges are brought to Welch and her team, she could face serious and severe legal scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

37303955,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317878,1733514019,“Bitcoin Price Will Even Reach Seven Figures” – Bitcoin Suisse Founder,"Niklas Nikolajsen, founder of Bitcoin Suisse, one of the oldest crypto companies specializing in asset storage, predicts a continued rise in the price of Bitcoin, even suggesting it could reach “seven figures.” In an interview with the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Nikolajsen also criticized crypto regulation and politics in Switzerland and praised the US under incoming President Trump as a pioneer. US Election and Bitcoin Halving Fueling Current Bull Run According to Nikolajsen, whose fortune is estimated at 200 to 300 million Swiss francs, Bitcoin ( BTC ) price will continue to rise. “The highest Bitcoin price is in the future,” Nikolajsen said, adding: “I was one of the few who bought a lot of Bitcoin under a dollar. When it hit one dollar, my friends told me to sell. I didn’t. And I’m still saying: we are in a bull market that will last until spring. Of course there will be setbacks, but the Bitcoin price will one day even reach seven figures.” Nikolajsen explained that the US election accelerated the current bull run but pointed out that in a “halving” year, which creates scarcity in the market due to the halving of newly issued Bitcoins, a price spike towards the end of the year is typical. Nikolajsen also referred to the increasing acceptance of institutional investors and Trump’s announcement that he would buy Bitcoin as a currency reserve if re-elected. Senator Lummis Hints at U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Echoing Trump’s Crypto Promises Senator Lummis proposes a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. to acquire 1 million BTC to strengthen dollar and reduce the national debt. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 8, 2024 “If the US actually managed to buy one million Bitcoin, all players would come under pressure,” said Nikolajsen. There would be a gold rush, he predicted, not only among small investors but also among companies and governments. “The Chinese would be forced to act, as would other countries that had failed to establish their own Bitcoin reserves.” “Switzerland Is No Longer the Right Place To Start a Crypto Company” According to Nikolajsen, Switzerland should also hold Bitcoin as a currency reserve. “It is not in Switzerland’s interest to have an institution that buys all kinds of debt instruments in the EU and loses so much money over such a long period of time,” he argued with regard to the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Instead, the SNB should hold “good assets” such as Bitcoin. Switzerland has lost ground in the area of crypto regulation, Nikolajsen said, adding that “Switzerland is still better at regulation than many EU countries, but it is certainly not a global leader”. The vision of making Switzerland a leading location for the global crypto industry “died with the personnel changes in the Federal Council”. The Financial Market Supervisory Authority ( FINMA ) has lost its nerve , according to Nikolajsen, and no longer grants crypto companies banking licenses. “The authority doesn’t want crypto banks, but rather banks that “do crypto”. Unfortunately, Switzerland is no longer the right place to start a crypto company,” he added. Switzerland Still Attracts Crypto Investors Though no longer active in the industry since the end of 2021, Niklas Nikolajsen is still one of Switzerland’s most well-known crypto entrepreneurs. In November, he became president of the Bitcoin Association Switzerland, an industry group aiming to strengthen Switzerland’s position as a leading hub for Bitcoin innovation. However, not all Bitcoin investors share Nikolajsen’s pessimistic opinion. In September, Billionaire investor Christian Angermayer reportedly left the United Kingdom for Switzerland’s Bitcoin hub, Lugano. With about 1,000 stores accepting Bitcoin, Lugano – a small town in an Italian-speaking region of Switzerland – is a real-world example of crypto in action. This is partly thanks to a partnership with Tether, which makes using crypto for everyday purchases easy. Since 2022, Lugano has also hosted the Bitcoin-themed conference “Plan ₿ Forum” annually.

Pump.fun access has now been restricted to users in the United Kingdom following the warning. FCA Flags Pump.fun: Are UK Users at Risk of Losing Funds? In a statement published on December 3, the FCA said, “This firm may be providing or promoting financial services or products without our permission. You should avoid dealing with this firm and beware of scams.” BREAKING: UK RESTRICTS @pumpdotfun FROM RESIDENTS — BSCN Headlines (@BSCNheadlines) December 6, 2024 The regulator expressed concerns that the platform “may be targeting people in the UK” despite not being authorized to conduct business with customers in the country. The platform, which allows users to create and trade Solana tokens without coding experience, confirmed that UK-based users can no longer access its services. Users attempting to access Pump.fun from the UK are warned on the website about restricted access . “Restricted jurisdiction. Our systems have identified that you are in the United Kingdom,” the statement read. “In accordance with the laws and regulations of the United Kingdom, this site is currently unavailable to users in the United Kingdom.” “If you have coins deposited in the private wallet, please follow this link that will allow you to withdraw your coins,” the warning continued. As of the time of writing, Pump.fun has not issued a statement about the FCA’s warning on its official X account or Telegram channel. Under UK regulations, companies offering cryptocurrency-related services must register with the FCA if subject to the country’s money laundering laws. According to the FCA, customers using unauthorized firms like Pump.fun risk losing their funds with little to no recourse. The regulator emphasized that users would lack financial protections and might find it difficult to recover their money if problems arise. Is Pump.fun’s Success Sustainable Amid Mounting Controversies? Pump.fun has faced numerous controversies since its launch in January. In May, the platform introduced a livestreaming feature for meme coin creators after an incident where a user set themselves on fire while promoting a token. The livestreaming feature, however, sparked further outrage when it was used for disturbing stunts, including threats to animal life and a staged suicide. In October, the platform faced severe backlash after child sexual abuse material was discovered on its site, exposing flaws in its moderation system. Following these events, Pump.fun removed its live-streaming feature entirely. Despite these controversies, Pump.fun accounted for 62% of all Solana transactions in November, according to on-chain data from Dune Analytics. However, the platform’s ethical and legal issues have raised questions about its long-term viability. Pump.fun is registered in the UK under Baton Corporation Ltd., with its employees reportedly working in London during a high-profile internal scandal.

37302183,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624024,1733513426,Total world debt hits a record $323 trillion in Q3,"Global debt has hit an earth-shattering $323 trillion in the third quarter of 2024. That’s $12 trillion more than where we started the year. Over the last two decades, total global debt has tripled, putting today’s figure into perspective. Debt-to-GDP now sits at 326%, higher than pre-pandemic levels, and it’s not showing signs of slowing down. Emerging markets are carrying $105 trillion of this debt or 245% of their GDP. These are near-record levels, leaving economies with limited breathing space to prioritize anything but survival. Debt payments are eating up money that should be spent on health, education, and infrastructure. Poor countries, broken systems Multilateral institutions are becoming the only lifeline for struggling nations, according to Indermit Gill, Chief Economist at the World Bank. “In highly indebted poor countries, multilateral development banks are now acting as a lender of last resort, a role they were not designed to serve,” he said. He added that financial systems are so broken that money flows out of poor economies when they desperately need inflows to survive. The situation is grim. Previous research from the IMF highlights how fiscal policy worldwide is skewing toward higher spending. Governments are under pressure to allocate more money to aging populations, healthcare, climate adaptation, and military spending—all while debt continues to climb. Geopolitical tensions aren’t helping either, as defense and energy security demands pile on. But there’s more bad news: debt forecasts are notoriously wrong. The IMF’s historical data shows that debt-to-GDP ratios typically exceed projections by 10 percentage points within five years. So, whatever projections are being made now? Take them with a grain of salt. The situation could easily be worse than what’s on paper. It actually almost always is. The IMF’s Fiscal Monitor introduces a new “debt-at-risk” framework, aiming to provide a better picture of future debt outcomes. Spoiler alert: the risks are massive. If things go south—slower growth, fiscal policy failures, and rising uncertainty—global public debt could hit 115% of GDP within three years. That’s 20 percentage points higher than current projections. Countries are also being squeezed by global factors like spillovers from U.S. policy instability, making it even harder to manage borrowing costs. The hidden threat of unaccounted debt Unaccounted debt, or unidentified liabilities, is another problem weighing down public finances. A deep dive into over 30 countries shows that 40% of these liabilities stem from state-owned enterprises and other fiscal risks. On average, these hidden debts are between 1% and 1.5% of GDP but can spike during financial stress. This is a ticking time bomb for countries already struggling to manage their visible debts. Here’s the real kicker: current fiscal adjustments aren’t even close to what’s needed. According to the IMF, countries are targeting an average adjustment of 1% of GDP over six years. To stabilize debt, they’d need to tighten fiscal policy by 3.8% of GDP. That’s nearly four times the current plan. For economic giants like China and the U.S., the required effort is even larger. But unlike smaller countries, they have more tools and options at their disposal. The real cost of fixing debt Fixing debt won’t come cheap. Cutting public investment might seem like a quick solution, but it tanks long-term growth prospects. On the flip side, slashing social transfers leaves vulnerable populations hanging out to dry. The IMF argues for a balanced approach, where countries focus on growth-friendly measures while safeguarding social safety nets. Advanced economies are expected to reform entitlement programs and improve taxation systems. Emerging markets, meanwhile, have room to increase revenues by broadening tax bases and improving tax administration. But they also need to maintain public investments to support development goals. Timing matters, too. Gradual fiscal adjustments are less painful and limit economic fallout, while abrupt moves can cause massive output losses—up to 40% more than gradual measures. Still, countries facing high debt distress may not have the luxury of time. They’ll need to front-load their adjustments to avoid immediate crises. Governments also need to clean up their act. Stronger fiscal governance, better risk management, and transparent debt statistics are critical to rebuilding trust. Without these measures, public confidence in fiscal policy will continue to erode.

Investors are now looking at the Rexas Finance (RXS) for a potential rally of 17,500%. This altcoin could be the next market cycle star with its remarkable tokenization, powerful ecosystem, and growing market presence. Rexas Finance: Transforming RWA through tokenization Rexas Finance is at the forefront of the tokenization of physical assets such as real estate, plane tickets, fine art, and others, offering fractional ownership in markets that were once out of reach. By integrating traditional assets with blockchain solutions, RXS is creating a new era of investment opportunities for retail and institutional investors. The platform will offer an ecosystem with many advanced solutions, including Rexas Estate for tokenized real estate purchases and Rexas Treasury, a multi-chain yield farming tool. Rexas Finance is also launching components, such as Rexas Launchpad for creating decentralized projects and Rexas GenAI for building NFTs, to provide an all-in-one blockchain solution.

Presale progress and tokenomics As of now, Rexas Finance has sold 292 million tokens, raising over 21 million dollars. Currently, the project is in stage 9 of the presale with a $0.125 price for RXS, a relatively low entry point for buyers looking to take positions in this token. Notably, RXS will launch on major exchanges at a listing price of $0.20 per token. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, RXS has devised an intelligent distribution scheme that will facilitate stability while rewarding stakeholders. The scheme is divided so that 42.5% goes toward the presale, 22.5% to staking pools, and 15% to liquidity. Smaller portions are set aside for marketing, partnerships, and community giveaways without undermining growth potential. This structure encourages early involvement and enhances the project’s chances of success.

Analyst Evaluates the Possibility and Gives His Answer,"Cryptocurrency analyst Fred Krueger has weighed in on recent claims that Bitcoin is in a speculative bubble, arguing that the current state of Bitcoin adoption does not meet the conditions for a true bubble. Drawing comparisons to historical financial manias, Krueger argued that Bitcoin is still far from achieving the widespread consensus and frenzy that defines bubble dynamics. Providing a detailed explanation, Krueger noted that real bubbles occur when almost everyone adopts a “new narrative,” leading to speculative excess and unsustainable market behavior. He cited several historical examples: Japan in 1990: The belief that Japan's “Rising Sun” economy would surpass that of the United States fueled a financial engineering frenzy known as “Zai-Tech” that eventually led to its collapse. The Dot-Com Bubble (1999): A universal consensus about the transformative power of the Internet created a “Gold Rush” mentality that led people to leave stable jobs for risky technology ventures. Housing Bubble (2007): The widespread enthusiasm for home flipping and easy access to “no income, no job” (NINJA) loans resulted in a catastrophic housing market crash. Related News: JUST IN: This Altcoin Offered to Sell All of Its Own Tokens in Its Treasury and Buy Bitcoin and These Altcoins Instead! Krueger argues that these events have one thing in common: near-total involvement of investors and the public. Krueger argued that Bitcoin’s current adoption lags behind these historical precedents. Noting that prominent financial figures like Peter Schiff and Warren Buffett remain skeptical, Krueger said, “Wall Street is fascinated by this story, but 99.9% of traditional investors are still waiting on the sidelines.” While some early adopters and institutions have entered the space, Krueger believes most investors still stick to traditional strategies like 60/40 portfolio allocation, indicating that Bitcoin has yet to gain mainstream acceptance. Krueger suggested that Bitcoin could eventually reach bubble proportions, but only as it gains wider acceptance over the next 5-10 years. Kerry warned that a “world where everyone has a greater or lesser understanding of Bitcoin” could set the stage for a major bear market, adding that the ultimate precondition for such a crash would be “a world where no one expected this.” *This is not investment advice.

In a report published by The Street , Armes revealed that the state is considering stockpiling Bitcoin in the first quarter of 2025 , reflecting its progressive approach to cryptocurrency investments. Florida’s History with Cryptocurrency Investments 1. Existing Crypto Exposure Florida has already made strides in cryptocurrency through its pension fund , which includes investments in Bitcoin and crypto-related assets . This sets the stage for further exploration into BTC reserves . 2. Leading by Example By considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset, Florida signals its intent to lead in blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption among U.S. states. Why Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset? 1. Hedge Against Inflation Bitcoin’s fixed supply and deflationary nature make it an attractive hedge against inflation, especially for state-level reserves. 2. Diversification of Assets Adding Bitcoin to Florida’s reserves could diversify its portfolio and reduce reliance on traditional financial instruments. 3. Growing Institutional Adoption Major companies like MicroStrategy and governments, including El Salvador , have already adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset, showcasing its viability in long-term strategies. Potential Benefits for Florida 1. Financial Growth Bitcoin’s historical performance as a store of value offers the potential for significant returns over time. 2. Positioning as a Crypto Hub Investing in Bitcoin aligns with Florida’s reputation as a tech-friendly state , attracting blockchain companies and investors. 3. Boosting Blockchain Ecosystem Adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset could spur innovation and collaboration within Florida’s blockchain ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations 1. Volatility Concerns Bitcoin’s price fluctuations might pose risks to state reserves, requiring cautious allocation and robust risk management. 2. Regulatory Scrutiny The U.S. federal government and financial watchdogs may closely monitor Florida’s move, influencing its decision-making process. What’s Next? The decision to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset is expected in Q1 2025 , with updates likely to emerge through the Florida Blockchain Business Association. If successful, Florida could pave the way for other states to consider cryptocurrency in their financial strategies. Conclusion Florida’s potential move to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset highlights its innovative approach to finance and blockchain technology. If implemented, it could bolster the state’s position as a leader in the cryptocurrency space and inspire similar initiatives across the U.S. Stay updated with the latest developments on cryptocurrency adoption and state-level investments by exploring our article on latest news .",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/florida-bitcoin-reserve-asset/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

The shift moves the index from the “Extreme Greed” zone into the “Greed” zone , reflecting a slight cooling in market enthusiasm. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index 1. What the Index Measures The Crypto Fear & Greed Index quantifies sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 to 100 : 0–24: Extreme Fear. 25–49: Fear. 50–74: Greed. 75–100: Extreme Greed. At 72 , the market still displays optimistic sentiment but with reduced intensity compared to the Extreme Greed levels seen earlier. 2. Factors Considered The index evaluates six key factors: Volatility (25%) : Measures recent price fluctuations and their significance. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Tracks trading volume and momentum. Social Media (15%) : Analyzes trends and sentiment across platforms like Twitter. Surveys (15%) : Incorporates sentiment data from polls. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Reflects BTC’s market share relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%) : Monitors search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms. Implications of the Shift to ‘Greed’ 1. Reduced Market Euphoria The decline from Extreme Greed suggests a more measured optimism in the market. Investors may be taking profits or waiting for new catalysts to reignite momentum. 2. Cautionary Signals The “Greed” zone often signals potential overvaluation, prompting some traders to exercise caution. Historically, sharp corrections can follow periods of extended greed. Key Market Trends Amid the Drop 1. Volatility and Bitcoin Dominance Recent Bitcoin price fluctuations have contributed to the sentiment shift, with BTC consolidating near critical resistance levels. Bitcoin’s dominance remains steady, indicating limited capital flow into altcoins. 2. Social Media Buzz Social media sentiment cooled slightly, suggesting less hype-driven trading activity. Investor Strategies During ‘Greed’ Periods 1. Balancing Risks and Rewards Profit-Taking: Consider securing gains from recent price rallies. Reallocation: Explore underperforming assets with strong fundamentals. 2. Monitoring Key Metrics Keep a close eye on volatility and trading volumes , which can signal shifts in sentiment. Conclusion The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 72 indicates a moderation in market sentiment, shifting from Extreme Greed to a more tempered Greed zone. While optimism persists, the market may be entering a consolidation phase, offering both opportunities and risks for investors. Staying informed and balanced in your approach is crucial during this period of measured enthusiasm.

Despite CONL's past underperformance compared to Coinbase, the recent surge in digital assets has driven significant returns for both COIN and CONL. Bitcoin hitting $100k and capital flows into Ethereum have fueled a rally in the digital asset space, benefiting CONL. We'll assess if now is the right time to leverage products like CONL for continued gains in the crypto market. I last covered the GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily ETF ( CONL ) for Seeking Alpha in late August. For the second time this year, I rated CONL a 'sell' and made the argument that the proof was in the pudding on the fund. At that time, CONL had produced a 26% loss since my April article covering the fund. Compared with the 3% loss in Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ), CONL was clearly underperforming badly. But as has occasionally been the case in my experience writing for Seeking Alpha, my 'sell' call in August turned out to be very wrong. Data by YCharts The total return for CONL since my August 27th article is over 90%. Not too shabby. While I think it's also necessary to point out that CONL has not actually delivered two times the return of holding Coinbase Global, Inc. ((COIN)) directly, I can't argue with a 91% total return in slightly over 3 months. The proof is in the pudding again and ' fortune favors the brave ' as they say over at a competing crypto exchange. Since August, Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) has hit $100k per coin, capital flows have returned to Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ), it's a party in the digital asset space , and even celebrity meme coins are making national headlines for all the wrong reasons . Crypto is so back . In this update, we'll look at what has been driving returns in Coinbase stock and assess whether the time is right to make a leveraged bet on the crypto bull party continuing through a product like CONL. Quick Recap: CONL Details, Objective, & Key Risk The GraniteShares 2x Long COIN ETF was launched in 2022 and has one purpose; to produce double the returns of COIN shares each and every day. The fund is rebalanced on a daily basis, which ultimately leads to long-term decay in the fund. This is absolutely not a product that is intended for long-term investment. It is specifically designed for traders who want to place short-term directional bets on Coinbase stock. AUM: $1.6 billion. Expense ratio: 1.10%. Inception: August 2022. There are certainly some benefits to single-stock leveraged funds. For someone who has a strong bullish (or bearish) opinion on a stock and doesn't want to use a margin account or personally play around with options, leveraged ETF shares can work quite well as a way to express a high-conviction idea. Essentially, CONL gives a trader who believes COIN will quickly appreciate 'synthetic buy power' while only risking whatever capital has been allocated to the trade. Data by YCharts However, it is very important to remember that the daily rebalancing strategy will cut into the fund's performance over a long period of time. Consider the chart above which shows the total return of COIN and CONL since the inception of CONL. CONL's 2x leveraged strategy loses against the unleveraged stock over the long term. So, if you like Coinbase as an investment, just buy COIN. CONL is fine for short-term trading, but will not beat the underlying over a longer period of time. With all that said, is it time to buy this fund even after COIN has already produced a 10x run over these last two years and nearly doubled in just 5 weeks? This may surprise some of my readers, but I'm actually not going to totally admonish the idea. What Drives COIN Performance Data by YCharts In prior work, I've mentioned valuation as a significant risk in longing Coinbase stock. Any downward repricing risk in COIN would be doubly bad for CONL. However, it seems clear that - at least for now - valuation is not what is driving the bus on COIN. Data by YCharts Looking at the price of COIN against quarterly revenue, the stock price generally leads sales both to the upside and to the downside. For instance, when reported revenue peaked in Q4-21, the price of COIN stock had already peaked in mid-November, well before earnings were released for full year 2021. Coinbase hit a bombed-out low of $31 per share in January 2022; presumably driven down by end-of-year tax loss harvesting in December. While total quarterly revenue had already bottomed out in Q3-22, transaction revenue didn't find a sequential rebound until Q1-23: Revenue Millions Q1-22 Q2-22 Q3-22 Q4-22 Q1-23 Total Transaction Revenue $1,013.0 $655.2 $365.9 $322.1 $374.7 Total Subscription & Service Revenue $151.9 $147.4 $210.5 $282.8 $361.7 Net Revenue $1,164.9 $802.6 $576.4 $604.9 $736.4 Source: Coinbase It's a bit more difficult for the market to predict subscription and service revenue from the Coinbase platform. However, it's much easier to project the quarterly revenue from transactions. Thus, transaction volume can serve as a great indicator of top line revenue in Coinbase's quarterly reports. When exchange volume is moving, COIN stock generates positive returns. And exchange volume is absolutely on fire at the moment: Coinbase Monthly Exchange Volume (The Block) The chart above shows the monthly exchange volume for Coinbase going back to May 2017. November 2024 produced $175.8 billion in volume. That's the fourth-best month for Coinbase on record: Top 5 Months Exchange Volume May 2021 $259.1 November 2021 $208.2 October 2021 $186.1 November 2024 $175.8 September 2021 $157.5 Source: The Block The chart above the table also has a crudely drawn arrow above December 2024 as well. Through just 5 full days, Coinbase has already done $49.1 billion in exchange volume this month. If we assume this 5-day average volume pace continues through the end of the month, December would do over $304 billion in exchange volume for Coinbase. To be clear, I am not projecting that to happen and would expect a transaction volume slow down in late December. But in my opinion, transaction volume in December 2024 is likely going to challenge for Coinbase's best month ever. I suspect exchange volume is probably one of the best metrics to pay attention to if you're looking to time a long trade in CONL, or COIN for that matter. And if this rally in altcoins continues to drive exchange volume revenue for Coinbase, it's tough for me to argue against CONL as a solid way to express that thesis from now through the end of the year. Closing Thoughts Data by YCharts It is imperative to remember that funds like CONL are intended for short-term tactical trading by seasoned speculators. 2x leveraged funds are not products intended for long-term investment. One leveraged long position at a time is perfectly suitable for my own portfolio, and I've already chosen the Volatility Shares' 2x Ether ETF ( ETHU ) for that honor. But I'm going to begrudgingly upgrade CONL to a 'hold' from a 'sell' at this point in time. I have little doubt that CONL shares will ultimately trade well below the current share price of $67 at some point down the line. However, I see a very real possibility that the fund shares will go much higher from here before that happens. Good luck out there.

Aave (AAVE), a pioneer in decentralised finance, has already proven that blockchain technology can revolutionise traditional finance. With $31 billion in net deposits and an all-time high token price of $234, Aave has cemented its place as a leader in the DeFi space. But the story doesn’t end here. As Aave paves the way for decentralised lending and borrowing, a new contender is stepping into the spotlight, ready to raise the bar even higher. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a groundbreaking Layer 1 blockchain project that combines innovation, utility, and massive profit potential. With its unique decentralised VPN application and the world’s first Web3 aggregator platform, Qubetics isn’t just playing the game—it’s rewriting the rules. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, Qubetics is turning heads for all the right reasons. Aave (AAVE): The DeFi Kingpin Aave has been a game-changer in the world of decentralised finance, offering peer-to-peer lending and borrowing without the need for intermediaries. The protocol’s robust infrastructure has enabled users to earn interest on deposits, take out loans, and leverage collateral with unmatched ease. Its growth has been staggering. Aave’s net deposits hit $31 billion in December 2024, outpacing many traditional banks and underscoring its mainstream potential. In addition to its lending capabilities, Aave has introduced features like automated risk management through new oracles, solidifying its reputation as a trailblazer in DeFi. The AAVE token itself has seen massive gains, with a market cap of $3.5 billion and a price nearing its three-year high of $260. Analysts predict further upward momentum as the project continues to innovate and attract institutional interest. Why is Aave worth watching? It’s a proven performer, consistently delivering on its promise to reshape finance. But while Aave is undoubtedly impressive, its focus remains within the DeFi niche. That’s where Qubetics comes in, ready to expand the blockchain’s utility far beyond decentralised finance. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Utility While Aave revolutionised DeFi, Qubetics is taking on a much broader mission: becoming the ultimate Web3 aggregator. At the heart of its ecosystem is the Decentralised VPN (DVPN) , a game-changing application that provides secure, censorship-resistant internet access. This isn’t just about privacy—it’s about empowerment. Imagine a journalist in a restricted country accessing uncensored information or a small business owner protecting sensitive customer data. Qubetics’ DVPN offers both groups the ability to communicate and operate without fear of surveillance or interference. For freelancers working with international clients, the DVPN ensures secure cross-border communication, eliminating concerns about hacking or data breaches. For gamers, the DVPN offers a smoother online experience by bypassing geographical restrictions and latency issues. Even healthcare providers can use it to securely transfer sensitive patient data. The possibilities are endless, making Qubetics not just a blockchain project but a vital tool for the modern world. The presale numbers speak for themselves. Now in its 11th stage, Qubetics has sold over 270 million tokens to 6,500 holders, raising $4.4 million. At just $0.0282 per token, the current price is a steal compared to its projected listing price of $0.25—a potential ROI of 783%. Analysts predict even bigger gains: $1 per token post-presale (3,434% ROI), $5 after the mainnet launch (17,570% ROI), and up to $15, offering a mind-blowing 52,912% ROI. Let’s put this into perspective. If you invest $18,000 in Stage 11, you’d secure 638,297 $TICS tokens. At the presale listing price of $0.25, that investment would grow to $159,574. If $TICS reaches $1, your stake jumps to $638,297, and at $5, you’re looking at a staggering $3.19 million. Should the token hit $15, your $18,000 investment would be worth an unbelievable $9.57 million. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics offers a unique mix of utility, innovation, and profit potential, making it the best crypto to buy now for anyone looking to secure exponential gains in 2025. Conclusion: Don’t Just Watch—Act Now Aave has shown us the power of blockchain to disrupt traditional industries, and its success has set the stage for what’s possible. But the future belongs to projects that think bigger, solve real-world problems, and offer users unmatched value. That’s exactly what Qubetics is doing with its Decentralised VPN and Web3 aggregator platform. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the crypto space, Qubetics is an opportunity you don’t want to miss. The presale won’t last forever, and the clock is ticking on locking in the current price. Don’t just watch others capitalise on the next big thing—be part of it. Join the Qubetics presale today and position yourself for exponential gains in 2025. It’s not just the best crypto to buy now —it’s the future of blockchain.

Satoshi Loses Top Bitcoin Holder Crown To BTC ETFs A chart posted on X (aka Twitter) on Dec. 6 by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shows that the 11 spot Bitcoin funds now trading on U.S. stock exchanges hold as much as 1,103,965 BTC as of Dec. 5. Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator (or creators) mined the first Bitcoin back in 2009 under the moniker Satoshi Nakamoto, and their true identity has remained a mystery. Satoshi is believed to have mined roughly 22,000 of the first blocks, which, when multiplied by the 50 BTC block reward at the time, gives 1.1 million BTC. “The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total Bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1 million, more than anyone in the world, and they’re not even a year old yet, literally babies still.

The most prominent BTC ETF is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management. The IBIT recently topped 500,000 BTC (or over $50 billion) in AUM just as the price of the maiden cryptocurrency hit the $100,000 milestone for the first time on Wednesday. Notably, BlackRock boss Larry Fink conceded earlier this year that he was wrong about crypto and has changed his stance over the last five years. Spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT have played a huge role in bringing traditional institutional and retail investors into the crypto market. The data cited by Balchunas indicates that the cumulative ETF holdings now exceed those of crypto giant Binance by 41%. In addition, the ETFs hold roughly 62% more BTC than is held by software firm MicroStrategy — the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder.

DigitalCoinPrice estimates that MOBILE might surpass its previous high of $0.00779, projecting a range between $0.00287 and $0.00299 by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, Wallet Investor predicts a more conservative outlook, suggesting that MOBILE could reach a maximum price of $0.00183 by the close of December. Helium Mobile price prediction 2025 According to DigitalCoinPrice’s Helium Mobile token price prediction for 2025, MOBILE’s value could range from $0.00294 to $0.00356, with a likely average around $0.00339 by the end of the year. Wallet Investor, however, presents a more bearish outlook, forecasting that MOBILE might decline to $0.000226 by late 2025. Meanwhile, CoinCodex’s Helium Mobile price prediction suggests the token could trade between $0.001359 and $0.004061 throughout the year. Changelly anticipates a minimum price of around $0.0016 in 2025, with a potential peak of approximately $0.002 based on historical price trends and market behavior. Helium Mobile price prediction 2030 According to CoinCodex’s expectations, MOBILE is projected to trade between $0.003684 and $0.009173 by 2030. DigitalCoinPrice predicts a slightly higher range, with MOBILE potentially reaching between $0.00925 and $0.01 by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, Changelly’s projections indicate a more significant leap in value, estimating the token could trade between $0.0103 and $0.0123 in 2030. Overall, Helium Mobile looks poised for growth as more people adopt the network and benefit from its decentralized structure. That said, like any cryptocurrency, its value could still be influenced by market ups and downs and other external factors. FAQ Is Helium Mobile a good investment? Helium Mobile could be an intriguing investment, especially if you’re drawn to projects that combine blockchain with real-world applications. By decentralizing mobile connectivity and partnering with major players like T-Mobile, it offers something different from many other cryptos. While predictions suggest potential growth, with targets like $0.00339 in 2025, it’s essential to remember that the crypto market is unpredictable. Doing your own research and assessing your risk tolerance is crucial before investing. How high can Helium Mobile go? There’s no crystal ball, but analysts see room for Helium Mobile to grow. DigitalCoinPrice expects Helium Mobile to reach $0.01 by 2030, while Changelly is even more optimistic, forecasting a price around $0.0123, driven by network expansion and market movements. If Helium Mobile continues gaining traction, those numbers could be realistic — but as with all things crypto, nothing’s guaranteed. Does Helium Mobile have a future? Helium Mobile’s decentralized network, where users earn tokens for setting up hotspots, positions it well for the future of mobile connectivity. As adoption rises, it could really take off, but like all tech, it’ll need to adjust to market shifts.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/helium-mobile-price-prediction/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37301132.jpeg

37301042,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311881,1733511918,"Bitcoin Primed To Keep Appreciating Against US Dollar Forever, According to Michael Saylor – Here’s His Outlook","The executive chairman and co-founder of enterprise software firm MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) will always appreciate against the US dollar. In a new interview with Yahoo Finance, Bitcoin bull Saylor says that the flagship crypto asset is on track to eventually hit $1 million after breaking through the $100,000 resistance level earlier this week. “It’s still less than $1 million a coin. You’re getting a 90% discount from $1 million a coin. I’m sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin, probably a billion dollars a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin. And so I think it’s a very simple idea. Just keep buying Bitcoin with your spare capital. It’s going to appreciate against the dollar forever.” Saylor predicts that Bitcoin will grow in value by a decreasing annual recurring revenue (ARR) percentage in the coming years. He has said Bitcoin may hit $13 million a coin in 2045. “I don’t chart it month-by-month, but I noticed that it’s been a 60% ARR for the past four years, and even before that point, and my model is generally that it will grow at 60% ARR decelerating to 20% ARR over 21 years. So if you start to crank in 60% and 58% and 56% and 54%, and you put that on a scale, absent the cycle cyclical volatility, you get to a forecast which makes sense.” Saylor also predicts that Bitcoin will see less volatility than in the past as the market has matured and adoption increased, such as through the spot BTC exchange-traded funds, which launched earlier this year. He says he doesn’t expect anything like the “80% drawdown in the depth of the crypto winner from $66,000 to $16,000” to happen again. “The market right now is driven by the ETFs, driven by the options market, driven by companies like MicroStrategy, driven by the global adoption. So I think what you’ll see is you will still see volatility, but you won’t see the extreme drawdowns of the last cycle. You’ll see a more gentle volatility. It’ll surge up, it’ll come back.” Bitcoin is trading for $99,412 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

Some spot Solana ( SOL ) exchange-traded fund issuers were informed of upcoming roadblocks for their applications by Securities and Exchange Commission staff, Eleanor Terrett of Fox Business said on X, citing inside sources. Issuers were reportedly notified that the SEC would not consider new cryptocurrency ETF bids till Donald Trump takes office, leaving spot Solana funds in limbo until January 2025. So far, five firms, including VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and Grayscale, have submitted applications, https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1864874666445152672 You might also like: Solana ETF talks “progressing” at SEC: report The reports of delays for 19b-4 filings, otherwise known as proposals for rule changes, arrived despite supposed progress with spot Solana funds in late November. At the time, firms pointed to feedback from the SEC and dialogue with agency staffers about advancing Form S-1 documents, a formality in securities registration for ETFs. Issuers like WisdomTree have sought to expand the existing crypto product suite, encouraged by the success of spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs and strides made by spot Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs in recent weeks. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been a breakout story of the year, garnering $109 billion in assets since January and overtaking dormant holdings attributed to Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Issuers also filed paperwork to list spot ( XRP ) ETFs, as Ripple’s business looked ever stronger with stablecoin plans amid shifting policy climates and a new White House regime under pro-crypto President-elect Donald Trump. Still, Wall Street leaders like BlackRock and Fidelity have deferred from joining the race to list crypto ETFs outside Bitcoin and Ethereum.

With rock-solid tokenomics and plans for both CEX/DEX listings, XYZ is positioned for a championship run, ensuring a steady revenue flow and consistent token burns to keep the scoreboard in favor of a strong price and a thriving community. >>The XYZ presale is live – don’t miss out on this knockout 9,900% opportunity! Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. Creators Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer wanted a fun alternative to serious cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. They chose the popular Shiba Inu meme as the logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin is plentiful. There’s no maximum supply, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. At first, people saw it as a ""memecoin."" But in 2021, Dogecoin's value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, worth over $50 billion. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, helped fuel this rise. The coin's popularity showed the power of community and social media in financial markets. Dogecoin's technology is simple and easy to use. It has fast transaction times and low fees. This makes it good for small payments and tipping online. The coin's potential lies in its strong community and widespread recognition. In the current market, Dogecoin stands out for its unique story and support from influential figures. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, it may not have advanced features like smart contracts. But its simplicity can be an advantage. With the crypto market always changing, Dogecoin could still have room to grow. Its future depends on continued community support and market trends. Cardano (ADA) Cardano's ADA is turning heads in the cryptocurrency world. This blockchain platform is designed with flexibility and sustainability at its core. Unlike many of its competitors, Cardano uses a proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros. This means it consumes far less energy than traditional proof-of-work systems, making it environmentally friendly. With smart contracts, it allows developers to build decentralized finance apps, create new crypto tokens, and even develop games. What sets Cardano apart is its innovative two-layer system. The Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Computing Layer manages smart contracts. This separation enhances its ability to process transactions swiftly—potentially up to a million per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano's native tokens offer secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In a market that values efficiency and sustainability, ADA stands out. As environmental concerns grow and scalability becomes crucial, Cardano's technology positions it as an attractive option in the current crypto cycle. Comparisons to Ethereum are inevitable, but ADA's commitment to green technology gives it a unique edge. Solana (SOL) Solana is a blockchain platform that aims to be faster and more scalable than its rivals. Like Ethereum and Cardano, it supports decentralized applications, or dapps. What sets Solana apart is its design for speed. It handles transactions quickly without using add-ons like sharding. Developers can build on Solana using several programming languages, making it flexible and accessible. At the center of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's own cryptocurrency. People use SOL to make transactions, run programs, and reward those who support the network. The potential of SOL is tied to Solana's high-speed network. This makes it attractive for developers who need a platform that can handle lots of activity. For investors, SOL could be appealing in the current market cycle. While some other cryptocurrencies face issues with slow transactions and high fees, Solana offers a quicker alternative. This might lead more projects to choose Solana over others. With the crypto market always evolving, SOL stands out as a coin with promise and could be worth watching. Conclusion While Dogecoin, Cardano, and Solana are strong in the 2024 bull run, XYZVerse's fusion of sports and memes sets it apart for exceptional growth.

Solana (SOL): A High-Performance Blockchain for Scalable Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability and speed, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. It stands out by enabling faster transactions without relying on sharding or second-layer solutions. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, powering programs, and rewarding network participants. The platform supports development across multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. With its high-capacity network designed for hosting high-activity products and services, Solana has potential in the blockchain space. In the current market cycle, its emphasis on scalability and performance makes it a noteworthy option for developers and users interested in decentralized applications. Toncoin (TON): Native Cryptocurrency of The Open Network with Growth Potential Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized layer-1 blockchain. Originally developed by Telegram as ‘Gram’, the project is now led by the TON Foundation after Telegram ceased involvement due to an SEC court order. Toncoin operates on a proof-of-stake consensus, offering fast, secure transactions with low fees. The network plans to build a full ecosystem including decentralized storage, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Price predictions estimate TON could reach up to $30.30 in 2025 and $26.04 in 2030, indicating substantial growth. Given its technological potential and favorable forecasts, Toncoin seems attractive in the current market cycle. AVAX Avalanche Eco-Friendly Blockchain with Fast Transactions and Custom Subnets Avalanche, also known as AVAX, is a Layer-1 blockchain known for eco-friendly operations, low fees, and rapid transactions, capable of processing up to 4500 transactions per second. It features a hybrid consensus mechanism combining classical and Nakamoto principles, achieving transaction finality in under 2 seconds. The platform includes three interoperable chains called X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain. They handle various operations such as transactions and smart contracts. Users can launch customizable Subnets, enhancing the network’s functionality. The native token AVAX is used for transaction fees, staking for network security, and operating multiple Subnets. With its efficient technology and strong utility, AVAX holds potential in the current market cycle. Aptos (APT): A Scalable Blockchain Addressing Ethereum’s Limitations Aptos (APT) is a new layer-one blockchain designed to tackle high transaction fees and network congestion found in platforms like Ethereum. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by core contributors from Meta’s Diem project, it uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism for security and efficiency. Aptos employs the Move programming language for smart contracts, focusing on safety and flexibility. It supports a wide range of Web3 applications and emphasizes scalability. With its strong development team and innovative technology, Aptos shows significant potential in the blockchain market. Its solutions to existing blockchain challenges make it an attractive option for investors in the current market cycle. Conclusion Though SOL, TON, AVAX, and APT have potential, their short-term gains are less promising. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, anticipates 700% growth by the end of its presale, with potential for thousand-fold returns during this altcoin season. Following successful tokens like BONK, DOGEN aims for record-breaking success, building a community of leaders and offering real benefits to early adopters.

NEAR Protocol (NEAR) NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has seen significant price movement recently. Over the past month, its price surged by an impressive 119.38%. In the last week alone, it climbed another 16.24%. This upward trend shows growing interest in the coin. Currently, NEAR trades within the $6.17 to $7.46 range. It is approaching its nearest resistance level at $8.01. If it breaks through this point, the next target could be $9.30. However, if the price falls, it might find support at $5.42, with a secondary support at $4.12. Technical indicators suggest a potential continuation of the upward trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 64.50, indicating momentum but not yet overbought. The MACD level is positive at 0.1374, supporting bullish sentiment. However, the Stochastic at 88.77 suggests caution as it enters overbought territory. Investors might see potential for growth, but should watch for signs of resistance near $8.01. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen significant movement recently. Over the past week, its price increased by 22.17%. In the past month, it surged by 86.48%. However, over six months, the price change is 32.80%. The current price range is between $0.00002509 and $0.00003493. The Relative Strength Index is at 52.62, which is close to neutral territory. The Stochastic indicator stands at 23.53, suggesting the coin might be oversold. The MACD level is positive at 0.0000002951, hinting at bullish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00003166, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $0.00003011, indicating a short-term upward trend. If SHIB continues its upward trend, it may test the nearest resistance level at $0.00003897. Breaking this could lead to the second resistance at $0.00004881, which would be an increase of about 40% from the current upper price range. On the downside, if the price falls, it might find support at $0.00001929. Dropping to the second support at $0.000009456 would represent a significant decrease. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) has been on an interesting journey lately. Over the past week, its price has increased by 5.78%, showing modest growth in the short term. Looking at the monthly picture, KAS has surged by an impressive 56.58%, indicating strong upward momentum. However, when extending the timeline to six months, the price change is relatively flat, with a slight decrease of 0.47%. This suggests that recent gains may be recovering from previous declines. The current price range for KAS is between $0.15 and $0.18, aligning closely with both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.16. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 57.82, which is in the neutral zone but leaning towards bullishness. The Stochastic indicator is at a high 86.63, suggesting that the asset might be nearing overbought conditions. The MACD level of 0.0004472973 indicates subtle bullish momentum. Considering these technical indicators, KAS may continue its upward trend in the near term. The nearest resistance level is at $0.19; breaking through this could pave the way toward the second resistance at $0.22, representing a potential increase of around 22%. On the other hand, if the price faces downward pressure, the nearest support level is at $0.13, with a drop to the second support at $0.10 equating to a decrease of about 33%. Traders will be watching these levels closely as they could signal significant price movements. Avalanche (AVAX) Over the past month, Avalanche (AVAX) has seen significant growth. The price jumped by 135.44%, moving between $39.80 and $49.22. In the past week, it surged another 22.00%. This strong momentum suggests increased interest in AVAX. Over the last six months, AVAX's price increased by 59.66%, indicating steady long-term growth. The RSI is at 57.29, below the overbought level, suggesting potential for more gains. However, the Stochastic at 87.38 approaches overbought territory, hinting at possible consolidation. Resistance levels are at $53.29 and $62.70. Breaking above $53.29 could lead to a 27% rise to $62.70. Support levels are at $34.46 and $25.04. A drop to $34.46 would mean a decrease of about 30%. The 10 and 100-day SMAs are $52.81 and $50.61, so the price is below these averages. Conclusion NEAR, SHIB, KAS, and AVAX are strong options. However, XYZVerse unites sports fans, aims for 20,000% growth, and offers a unique, community-driven ecosystem with sustainable growth strategies.

A newcomer has achieved remarkable success in its presale, raising substantial funds before its official launch. Meanwhile, established cryptocurrencies are breaking key price barriers, signaling potential opportunities. This article explores these top digital assets and examines the factors driving their impressive performance. CYBRO to List Ahead of Schedule Following 450% Surge and $7 Million Presale CYBRO, the AI-driven multichain platform, is accelerating its timeline for listing on major exchanges after a standout presale performance. The platform raised $7 million and drew nearly 20,000 investors, positioning itself as a frontrunner in decentralized finance innovation. During its presale, CYBRO’s token price surged 450%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token is set to debut at $0.06, and analysts are already eyeing significant upside potential as demand intensifies. Be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum before it unlocks the full potential CYBRO aims to democratize access to decentralized finance with tools such as staking, farming, and lending. Its presale marked key milestones, including: CYBRO App Launch: Over 30 vaults offering competitive APYs, tailored to diverse investor strategies Blast Index Debut: A one-click investment feature that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols Platform Growth: Laying the groundwork for a streamlined, user-centric DeFi ecosystem. The platform’s roadmap through 2025 promises to build on its foundation with advanced features such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools. CYBRO’s listing comes amid growing interest in AI-driven financial platforms. With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning Cardano (ADA): A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a flexible and sustainable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. It enables the development of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum's ETH, allowing users to store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. Cardano stands out for its environmentally sustainable approach, using the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism for energy efficiency, unlike energy-intensive proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers—the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to 1 million transactions per second. Cardano native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, setting a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. XRP: A Decentralized Cryptocurrency for Borderless Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that runs on the XRP Ledger. It is designed as a digital, programmable currency that is open, borderless, and resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. Transactions are irreversible and secure, operating without a central authority. Settlements do not require a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion coins. Ripple, originally known as OpenCoin Inc., was gifted 80 billion XRP to enhance network liquidity and support the ecosystem. To control the supply release, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow. The name XRP comes from ""ripple credits,"" highlighting its goal to facilitate smooth payment transfers across different currencies. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like ADA and XRP may show less potential in the short term, CYBRO stands out as a remarkable opportunity. This advanced DeFi platform uses AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to help investors maximize their earnings. With features such as attractive staking rewards, special airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO offers a superior user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. By focusing on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has caught the attention of major crypto investors and influencers. As the bull run of 2024 continues, CYBRO presents a promising option for those looking to enhance their positions in the thriving crypto market.

37300605,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98468,1733510628,"Ethereum Hits $4,000, Could All-Time High Be Next? Market Indicators Suggest Major Upside","Ethereum has officially broken the $4,000 mark for the first time since March. This milestone is not just a price movement—it’s a signal. With Ethereum up 65% over the past three months, the market is buzzing. But the real question is: Could a new all-time high (ATH) be coming next? Ethereum Back to $4,000 On December 5, Ethereum’s price surged to $3,800 and briefly topped $4,000. The momentum is undeniable. Alongside the price jump, Ethereum’s Realized Cap hit a new all-time high of $243.45 billion, per Glassnode data. This increase is more than just a number—it shows that Ethereum is being priced higher, a sign of growing confidence in the market. Add to that a record $428.5 million pouring into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and it’s clear: Investors are betting big on ETH. But there’s more going on than just price action. Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Long/Short Difference has flipped positive. ETH/USDT 5 Year Chart|TradingView Currently, at 5.67%, this shift indicates that long-term holders are now in profit—another bullish sign. When this happened before, Ethereum surged past $4,000, and it could be on track to do so again. Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also mirrors the upward momentum seen earlier this year when ETH hit yearly highs. Ethereum could push past $4,200 if this momentum continues, with some analysts predicting a potential rise to $4,500. What’s Next for ETH? The big question now is how high Ethereum can go. Analysts are eyeing $4,200 as the next key target, but there’s potential for even more if buying pressure remains strong. On the other hand, if this pressure fades, Ethereum could slip back below $3,500. This delicate balance could go either way in the short term. Despite Ethereum’s recent rally, many believe ETH is still undervalued. The $428.5 million in ETF inflows indicates that institutional interest is growing , which could drive even more upward momentum. Ethereum’s Realized Cap is also a strong sign of bullish sentiment—one that could signal a sustained rise. With strong market data and increasing investor confidence, Ethereum seems poised for more growth. The $4,000 mark is impressive, but it could just be the beginning.

Some digital coins are so affordable they cost less than a cup of cocoa. Yet, their growth potential is immense. This article explores five such cryptocurrencies that could turn a small investment into a million-dollar portfolio this holiday season. $CYBRO Targets 1000% Growth Post-Listing With $7 Million Raised CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain earn marketplace, is about to hit a major milestone with its Token Generation Event (TGE). After a lightning-fast presale that raised an impressive $7 million and drew in nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is now gearing up for its listing on major exchanges — and it’s happening very soon. During the presale, $CYBRO’s price surged 450% from $0.01 to $0.055 in its final stage. Now, with the token set to list at $0.06 on major exchanges, demand is through the roof. Many are predicting a 100x price surge once it hits the open market, thanks to the strong momentum and solid fundamentals backing the project. Join CYBRO Before the Listing Frenzy Drives Prices to the Moon What’s behind the hype? CYBRO combines cutting-edge AI with a user-friendly platform, offering tools like staking, farming, and lending that make DeFi investing accessible to everyone — from cautious newcomers to bold risk-takers. During its short presale CYBRO has already gone a long way in achieving crucial milestones: CYBRO App Launched: Users can now explore around 30 vaults offering competitive annual percentage yields (APY) to match their investment strategies perfectly First One-Click Strategy Introduced: The Blast Index, available in the Vaults list and on the One-Click page, simplifies investing by integrating with lending protocols Rapid Development Progress: CYBRO’s platform has laid the groundwork for seamless DeFi experiences, setting the stage for future growth and innovation. And there’s more to come. CYBRO’s roadmap through 2025 promises features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and even smarter AI tools, cementing its place as a game-changer in decentralized finance. With the listing just around the corner, $CYBRO is about to make its mark on major exchanges with all the momentum it’s built so far, this token looks ready to take off. Seize the Chance to Get in Early Before Demand for $CYBRO Skyrockets Cardano (ADA) Shows Strong Monthly Growth, Potential for Further Gains Cardano's price has been moving between $0.96 and $1.25 recently. Over the past month, it has surged by over 257%, indicating strong momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $1.35, and if the price breaks above this, it could aim for the second resistance level at $1.64. The simple moving averages for 10 and 100 days are close, suggesting consolidation. The RSI at 49.24 and the stochastic at 53.57 show neutral signals, which may point to a potential move in either direction. If the price falls, the nearest support is at $0.77. Investors will watch to see if the upward trend continues. Kaspa (KAS) Price Climbs as It Approaches Resistance at $0.19 Kaspa (KAS) is currently trading between $0.15 and $0.18, marking a 48.96% increase over the past month. The price is nearing the nearest resistance level at $0.19, with both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $0.16, indicating steady movement. The Relative Strength Index stands at 65.11, suggesting the asset is approaching overbought territory. A high Stochastic value of 99.29 may signal a potential slowdown. Immediate support is at $0.13, with a second support level at $0.10. Recent momentum suggests the price could test the second resistance level at $0.22. Sui (SUI) Shows Strong Momentum with Over 112% Monthly Growth Sui (SUI) has been on a significant upswing, with its price fluctuating between $3.08 and $3.76 recently. Over the past month, SUI's value has increased by more than 112%, highlighting strong market momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 61, indicating the asset is nearing overbought territory but hasn't crossed that threshold yet. The nearest resistance level is at $4.05; if the price surpasses this point, it could aim for the next resistance at $4.73. On the downside, support levels at $2.69 and $2.01 may offer a safety net against potential declines. Based on current trends and technical indicators, Sui shows potential for continued growth in the near term. Stellar (XLM) Consolidates After Massive Gain: Will It Break Resistance? Stellar (XLM) is trading between $0.46 and $0.62, consolidating after a staggering 413% gain in the past month. The nearest resistance is at $0.68; surpassing this could push the price towards $0.85, a potential increase of over 30%. Technical indicators are mixed: the RSI is around 46, indicating neutral momentum, while the MACD is slightly negative, suggesting possible bearish pressure. The price is near the 100-day moving average of $0.51. A drop below the support at $0.36 could lead to further declines toward $0.19. The coming days may reveal whether Stellar continues its upward trajectory or enters a corrective phase. Conclusion In December, while coins like ADA, KAS, SUI, and XLM show some potential, their short-term prospects seem limited. On the other hand, CYBRO presents an exceptional opportunity for investors aiming for substantial gains this holiday season. As an advanced DeFi platform, CYBRO leverages AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to maximize earnings. With features such as attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, it offers a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO stands out as a promising project drawing significant interest from crypto influencers and major investors.

37300020,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311868,1733509988,Anaxi Labs and Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab Unveil a Breakthrough Proof System,"December 6th, 2024 – Pittsburgh, United States Anaxi Labs , in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab , the university’s cybersecurity and privacy institute, is announcing a compiler framework for cryptography that resolves an impasse – building scalable applications with Zero-Knowledge require fundamental trade-offs. Anaxi Labs , in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab , the university’s cybersecurity and privacy institute, is announcing a compiler framework for cryptography that resolves an impasse – building scalable applications with Zero-Knowledge requires fundamental trade-offs. The elusive trifecta of scalable, cryptographically-secured and decentralized applications have been considered impossible, and a barrier to mass adoption — until now. A Breakthrough in Cryptography with No Trade-Offs Blockchains such as Ethereum have been hailed as the future of decentralized infrastructure, with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology heralded to enhance Ethereum’s security and scalability beyond 120 TPS. According to the team, developing ZK proofs is complex and time-consuming, requiring thousands of hours across dozens of developers. Prioritizing speed in proof generation also means manually designing protocols, and with manual coding and tens of thousands of lines of code this introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This complicates the creation of security-sensitive decentralized applications and makes auditability and compliance a nightmare – all hindrances to widespread adoption in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare and AI. A team of Carnegie Mellon researchers is collaborating with Anaxi Labs to overcome this trade-off CMU’s recent paper presents a revolutionary way to directly compile high-level software and convert it into simpler forms (low-level representations) needed for underlying proof systems to work. And all this is done automatically, repeatable and auditable, getting rid of the manual work, drastically improving performance while cryptographically ensuring security of the process. The work achieves this by analyzing the high-level program, breaking the program into small, indivisible units, then creating low-level representation from each unit that can be easily inputted into varieties of proof systems. “This idea of breaking the computation into very specific chunks that take the place of a CPU in an automatic way is a new approach, and this is the first time that somebody has attempted this kind of approach where we avoid the full program representation for the compiler,” said Riad Wahby, assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon University’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering . “We’re extremely excited about it.” Unlocking New Decentralized Applications The research and the framework Anaxi Labs is building from the research are set to revolutionize industries in Web3 and beyond. In traditional and regulated finance, the performance boost while maintaining auditability enables real-time settlement of intrabank transfers like instant USD payments. In healthcare, amid challenges faced by 23andMe, secure and privacy-preserving encryption tools enabled by product being developed by Anaxi Labs, could now address critical concerns and safely utilize private genetic information by ensuring rightful ownership of one’s DNA, while enabling valuable research. Within the realm of enterprise AI and critical physical infrastructures, a decentralized solution that requires high availability and close to zero latency such as rapid fine-tuning and inference across multiple data and compute power resources becomes a reality. In the immediate term, products based on the research provide the most effective solution for Web3 companies grappling with the scalability, security and decentralization trade-offs, offering a new design paradigm for rollups and interoperability. “This research and the product we are building incorporating the research will have profound implication to many important industry applications today that need a safe solution for their massive performance overheads, such as ZK and EVM, finally bringing us to the doorstep of our vision of cryptographically-secured decentralized consensus with real-time settlement,” said Kate Shen, co-founder of Anaxi Labs. “We also like the fact that it is language and library agnostic, meaning a wide variety of projects can benefit from this without code modification. This enabled us to build an open, collaborative framework as opposed to the increasingly static, monolithic approaches today,” Shen adds. “This enables all developers to automatically choose and combine the best of the latest advancements in proof systems such as lookups, co-processors and hardware acceleration; maximizing the performance gains of each computational substrate.” Anaxi Labs and CyLab, a Game-Changing Partnership Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab has been at the center of cutting-edge research that’s served as the foundation for blockchain development – including Zero-Knowledge. Notable faculty researchers from CyLab include esteemed professor Bryan Parno, a critical contributor to the history of ZK whose lab produced the widely cited Nova paper series , and assistant professor Riad Wahby, whose findings resulted in new cryptographic technologies that realized visions of the Ethereum Foundation (and more recently, the pathbreaking Jolt zkVM implementation by Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, a16z crypto). The findings set forth in this compiler framework are the result of the second research project originating from the symbiotic partnership between Anaxi Labs and CyLab through the CMU Secure Blockchain Initiative. This partnership enables CMU academics to collaborate and learn from the insights gleaned from the commercial deployments of their blockchain research, spearheaded by Anaxi Labs, for both Web3 and Web 2.0 applications. It enables them to find commercial solutions to major existing issues with blockchain that fail to bridge the gap between the known benefits of blockchain technology, and mass adoption. And it also serves as a springboard for CMU students to launch their careers in Web3. “Anaxi Labs’ partnership with CyLab advances CMU researchers’ ability to work on projects with direct, real-world applications, ensuring that their work has practical relevance and potential for impact,” said Michael Lisanti, CyLab’s Senior Director of Partnerships.

The incoming administration has the opportunity to reverse so many poor crypto policy decisions, chief among them politically motivated regulatory decisions like Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” he underscored. Challenges Faced By Crypto Companies Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a term used by the crypto industry, suggests that the US government is pressuring banks to cut ties with crypto companies. The original initiative, from 2013 to 2017, targeted payday lenders and high-risk activities. In November, high-profile executives from crypto firms claimed that banks informed them their accounts would be closed in 2023 due to their digital assets ties. For years, crypto companies have faced challenges in U.S. banking partnerships due to unclear federal regulators’ guidance, concerns about regulatory compliance, fraud risks, and potential reputational damage, leading to reluctance from banks.

The license allows GRVT to operate within the established regulatory framework of Bermuda and sets the stage for its objective of obtaining a Class Full (F) license by mid-2025. This upgrade would pave the way for GRVT to extend operations beyond the sandbox environment. GRVT Among First Regulated DEXs “By becoming one of the first licensed exchanges, GRVT is among the pioneers of regulated DEX operations. The platform, which is striving to provide the missing link between CeFi and DeFi for a holistic ecosystem, took 15 months for the license to be approved. The same period, from the start, also witnessed heavy internal mainnet testing for the platform, whose deployment began on December 4, 2024, for institutional partners. Mainnet release, Institutional Integration and Expansion It intends to release its mainnet in two weeks, available for all users to start seeing trading volume via large data providers. Currently, GRVT has institutional collaborations with 55 partners, including 17 market makers that have promised $4.2 billion worth of trading volume every month. Furthermore, it has had more than 20,000 retail users pass through KYC procedures to show the platform’s preparedness for broad adoption. CeDeFi Bridges CeFi and DeFi GRVT CEO Hong Yea emphasizes that CeFi and DeFi ecosystems need not remain divided. By leveraging a regulatory framework, the company aims to establish universal standards and improve market trust. Yea highlights the complementary roles of regulation and decentralization, where the former protects users and ensures fairness, while the latter promotes transparency and empowerment. This vision aligns with the emerging CeDeFi concept, which merges CeFi’s structure with DeFi’s decentralization. CeDeFi Gains Momentum GRVT is one of several companies that have now embraced the CeDeFi model, a hybrid that harmonizes traditional finance’s regulatory rigor with the innovative potential of DeFi. Other companies, like SafePal, have also integrated CeDeFi principles into their work and see the growing momentum of this concept in the crypto industry. According to Yea, a collaboration of decentralized and centralized systems is about reaching mainstream adoption and placating institutional hesitations around the unregulated status of DeFi.

DOGE is currently witnessing a consolidation phase, having rallied significantly between October and early November. Dogecoin Price Still Very Bullish Despite Recent Cool Off In a recent X post, KrissPax suggested that the Dogecoin price is still very bullish despite the recent cool-off. The crypto analyst stated that Dogecoin is trading on the 2-hour chart in a classic ascending triangle pattern. He added that the pattern looks bullish with a flat top resistance line, higher lows, and even the leverage flush that happened. Related Reading: Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Ethereum Price Crash Against Bitcoin Reveals Where It’s Headed Next KrissPax isn’t the first to highlight an ascending triangle pattern on the DOGE chart, which provides a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also recently drew the community’s attention to this bullish pattern and suggested that Dogecoin could rally to $0.56 when it breaks out from this consolidation triangle. Since its parabolic rally between October and early November, the Dogecoin price has consolidated within the $0.4 range. However, crypto analysts like Master Kenobi and Kevin Capital have suggested that the meme coin’s price action is expected and still in bullish territory despite this cool-off period. According to these analysts, the Dogecoin price consolidated for around 25 days in the last bull run after its first bull phase before it enjoyed another leg to the upside. History looks to be repeating itself, seeing as the foremost meme coin has consolidated for a similar number of days this time around. This consolidation period could soon end, as the Dogecoin price has cooled off for around 25 days this time around. In line with this, Master Kenobi predicts that Dogecoin could enjoy another pump in the next few days, rally to $1, and eventually reach as high as $2.9. DOGE’s Next Leg Will Be “Violent” Crypto analyst Bluntz Capital has predicted that the next leg up for the Dogecoin price will be explosive. In an X post, he stated that Dogecoin would record a “violent upside move” when it breaks this 3-week accumulation trend. His accompanying chart showed that the foremost meme coin would reach $0.6 on this next leg up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $100,000: Road To More Gains Or Potential Bull Trap?

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reports that these ETFs now control 1,104,534 BTC, surpassing the legendary stash of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi’s wallets, untouched since Bitcoin’s creation, hold around 1.1 million BTC, placing him in second place for the first time in history. To put it in perspective, other major holders like Binance control 633,103 BTC, MicroStrategy holds 402,100 BTC, and the U.S. government manages 198,109 BTC. These ETFs are not just changing the leaderboard; they’re rewriting Bitcoin’s story in real time. Bitcoin nears $100K as Trump fuels ETF frenzy The rapid accumulation by ETFs coincides with the ongoing crypto bull run, which saw BTC surge past $100,000 for the first time ever. It followed President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to reverse Biden-era crypto crackdowns and replace regulatory hostility with policies that favor the industry. Trump has even proposed building a strategic U.S. Bitcoin reserve. November saw $6.2 billion in net inflows to U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, shattering the previous record of $6 billion set in February. The approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a turning point. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under outgoing Chair Gary Gensler, had long resisted these products. It took a court ruling in 2023 to force the agency’s hand, paving the way for their launch in January. ETFs focused on Ether were approved shortly after. Meanwhile, Gensler is stepping down the same day Trump gets sworn in. Risk-managed ETFs enter the market As Bitcoin ETFs dominate the market, a new trend is coming: risk-managed Bitcoin ETFs. These products aim to make Bitcoin accessible to cautious investors by using derivatives to limit losses. These ETFs provide a “measured” way for people to gain Bitcoin exposure without facing its notorious volatility. The push for risk-managed products follows the introduction of options contracts on existing spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month. These contracts allow fund managers to deploy buffered or covered-call strategies, reducing downside risk in exchange for capping potential gains. Many top asset managers have already filed applications for these new ETFs. Calamos Investments plans to launch four managed-floor ETFs, while First Trust Portfolios has filed for a buffer ETF that shields investors from the first 30% of losses. Innovator ETFs are taking a different approach, proposing 10% and 20% buffer products that reset every three months. Grayscale Investments plans to introduce a covered-call Bitcoin ETF, generating income by selling call options on Bitcoin holdings.

37299664,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311859,1733509356,Zircuit Welcomes Ocelex: The Newest MetaDEX Driving DeFi Growth on Zircuit,"December 6th, 2024 – Zurich, Switzerland Ocelex is positioned to launch as a MetaDEX and liquidity layer on Zircuit , a zkEVM-based Layer 2 ecosystem designed for scalability and security. With its focus on capital-efficient innovation , community-driven participation , and 100% revenue sharing among token holders , Ocelex aims to create a transparent and inclusive DeFi environment. Zircuit’s infrastructure, which includes AI-driven sequencer security, provides a strong foundation for decentralized applications. Recent developments, such as the token generation event (TGE) of the ZRC token, have increased attention on the ecosystem. Ocelex’s launch will leverage this momentum to establish itself as Zircuit’s primary decentralized exchange, prioritizing liquidity, accessibility, and growth within the DeFi sector. Ocelex as the First Lynex Expansion As the first franchise expansion of Lynex—the leading liquidity protocol on Linea—Ocelex builds on a proven foundation. Lynex has achieved over $3.5 billion in trading volume and distributed $7.5 million in revenue to token holders, positioning it as one of the top-performing ve(3,3) DEXs. Ocelex continues this legacy by introducing Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) aggregation , a feature designed to simplify liquidity management through automated strategies. This approach reduces risks like impermanent loss while ensuring consistent yield for liquidity providers (LPs). Strategic Partnerships and Pre-Launch Momentum Even before its official launch, Ocelex has established key partnerships and secured significant Total Value Locked (TVL). These partnerships include: EtherFi, Kelp, and Renzo for LRTs (liquidity restaking tokens). Lido and StakeStone for LSTs (liquid staking tokens). StakeStone and Elara , two leading money market protocols to ensure seamless, integrated liquidity flows for users. Ocelex’s strong pre-launch performance underscores its potential to play a key role in Zircuit’s ecosystem growth. With a current TVL of $4.6M and total trading volume of $13.3M, Ocelex has already secured a solid foothold in the DEX category. A Community-First Approach Ocelex follows Lynex’s community-centric strategy with an airdrop that prioritizes long-term alignment. 45% of Ocelex’s initial supply will be airdropped to Lynex veLYNX holders who have locked tokens for one year or more. This approach rewards loyal participants while fostering ecosystem stability. Locking veLYNX has historically provided some of the most consistent yields among ve(3,3) protocols, a trend Ocelex aims to replicate.

For a comprehensive overview of the public sale, refer to this article or watch the accompanying short video . Ocelex Public Sale Projections Ocelex’s Dutch auction public sale lets the market decide its valuation and launch price, starting at $0.30 and decreasing linearly to $0.06. Community airdrop recipients, who will receive 50% of the initial supply as governance tokens, also stand to benefit from higher sale prices. With interest in Ocelex as the next big ve(3,3) DEX on Zircuit, the auction is expected to be highly competitive, following in the footsteps of Lynex, Aerodrome, and Thena. Ocelex’s Growth Potential Ocelex has the potential to secure substantial TVL on Zircuit, a network with over $2.5B in total value locked (TVL). This potential is modeled on the success of other ve(3,3) protocols: Aerodrome: Secured 41.56% of Base’s $3.85B TVL ($1.6B), with an FDV of $2.5B. Ocelex could achieve $1.039B TVL with a similar share. Lynex: Commands 4.7% of Linea’s $494M TVL ($23.2M) with an FDV of $29M. Ocelex could secure $117.5M TVL with comparable performance. Thena: Captures 1.47% of BNB Chain’s $5.8B TVL ($85M) with an FDV of $565M. Ocelex could achieve $36.75M TVL with this share. Ocelex Key Metrics: Dominant Case: $1.039B TVL (41.56%). Moderate Case: $117.5M TVL (4.7%). Conservative Case: $36.75M TVL (1.47%). With an FDV range of $6M to $30M , Ocelex presents an undervalued opportunity for early participants, particularly when compared to Aerodrome’s $2.5B FDV or Thena’s $565M. The Future of DeFi with Ocelex and Zircuit Ocelex combines Lynex’s successful model with Zircuit’s technical infrastructure, aiming to serve as a cornerstone for DeFi activity. With strong pre-launch momentum, strategic partnerships, and a focus on community alignment, Ocelex is positioned to deliver value and scalability for users and the broader DeFi ecosystem. About Ocelex Ocelex is the first expansion of the Lynex brand, launching as a franchise on Zircuit, an emerging Layer-2.

37301671,https://invezz.com/?p=2376699,1733509258,Bitcoin ETF options launch spurs record inflows,"BlackRock launched options on its Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on November 19, 2024, in a landmark event that looks set to bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream for institutional and retail investors. This is a moment in crypto history. As financial markets start to feel the effects of yet another major endorsement for the industry, the financial press is reeling with the impact of one single product and what that means for the future. The Bitcoin ETF options launch Blackrock initially launched its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in January and debuted options on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on November 19th. This was the first time a spot Bitcoin ETF offering options has traded publicly in the United States, and the results were astounding. Over 354,000 contracts were traded on the record-setting first day , with a notional value of $1.9 billion. Perhaps even more impressive than the sheer volume was the sentiment, with a 4.4:1 call-to-put ratio. There’s growing support for Bitcoin on the market as investors, both large and small, realize it’s not too late to profit from the original cryptocurrency. Binance CEO Richard Teng, leader of the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, commented on the effects of options trading on crypto markets, While uncertainty always accompanies innovation, the alignment of traditional and crypto markets through tools like options suggests a maturing landscape. These developments are a response to existing demand but also a catalyst for new opportunities. It is reasonable to expect that products like BTC ETF options will play a significant role in sustaining and accelerating the momentum of digital assets. IBIT took its place in the top 20 most active non-index options on the exchange. These financial packages like ETFs give traditional investors the contracts and paperwork they’re used to while exposing them to the crypto market. It’s a short step from buying an ETF to loading a crypto wallet, so this has to be good news for the industry. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Blachunas said: “$1.9b is unheard of for day one. For context, BITO did $363 million, and that’s been around for four years. And also, this is with 25,000 contract position limits. That said, $1.9b isn’t quite a big dog level yet, [though]. GLD did $5 billion today, but give it a few more days/weeks.” Record Inflows into BTC ETFs The launch of this Bitcoin ETF spurred a general influx of capital into all Bitcoin ETFs, with $816 million in a single day. That was a 220% increase over the previous day’s levels, and institutional investors are going for more than just the BlackRock ETF. Bitcoin Future ETFs also saw a 30% boost in trading volumes, and it’s a clear sign that investors are ready to buy into these ETF funds. They want to speculate on the price movement without necessarily holding Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s response This was a big day for Bitcoin, too, as it powered past the $90,000 mark in the wake of the options launch and hit an all-time high of $99,489. There was a ripple effect through the cryptocurrency exchanges with people looking to buy in. BlackRock is about as establishment as it gets, so this launch is about something bigger. It’s the old world’s seal of endorsement for the asset class. ETFs are crypto investing lite, but they are also a regulated and accessible way to trade Bitcoin derivatives without the heavy lifting. It is easy to see the appeal. Institutional adoption snowballs This monumental hit by BlackRock has already spurred several other financial institutions into action. Greyscale Investments will soon introduce options trading for its sport Bitcoin ETFS, and others will follow. These are new products that allow people to invest in Bitcoin without any actual exposure to crypto. Crypto options trading could also become a major profit center for institutional players and old-world investment banks. Many of the same strategies apply, and this could turn into a lucrative niche in the new financial world. Options can drive liquidity Options trading has given a whole new element to Bitcoin ETFs and turned them into a much more liquid and attractive package for the institutions and the investors. Giving investors the chance to speculate on Bitcoin’s price movements essentially creates a whole new financial battleground. This increased liquidity should help stabilize the crypto market and reduce the dramatic price swings that have been issues for institutional investors in the past. Comparison to previous milestones All the way back in October 2021, Futures-based Bitcoin ETF options launched in the US. It was another great milestone, but the products didn’t live up to the hype. They faced criticism for their reliance on derivatives, which added complexity and cost. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are much simpler and a way to tap into Bitcoin’s price movements without committing fully to crypto trading and holding. Options trading adds a level of sophistication and will bring in professional investors. Challenges and risks A lot will depend on Bitcoin’s performance in the weeks and months ahead. Bitcoin is flying in the wake of the presidential election, but a major price drop could test people’s appetite for crypto. Regulation is still an absolute minefield and differs from nation to nation, as certain regulators take a tougher stance on the systemic risks crypto can pose to the existing financial system. This lack of clarity is an obstacle to institutional investment, and the World Economic Forum is attempting to solve this with international standards. There is always the novelty factor as well. Right now, these ETFs are the flavor of the month. There is always something newer and shinier around the corner, though, so it remains to be seen if Bitcoin ETFs are here for the long-haul or if this is a short-term boost for the crypto industry. Conclusion The launch of spot Bitcoin ETF options is a turning point for the industry. From BlackRock signing it off to the record-breaking response, this is a giant leap towards respectability for the crypto community. November 19th, 2024, was a landmark year for Bitcoin, BlackRock, and the financial markets, and it may have a profound impact on all of their futures.

37300310,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317843,1733509051,Czech Republic Approves Capital Gains Tax Exemption for Bitcoin Held Over Three Years,"Bitcoin held for over three years will now be exempt from capital gains tax, following an amendment approved by the Czech Republic on Friday, December 6, 2024. This new rule, which takes effect on January 1, 2025, introduces a favorable tax framework for crypto investors and marks a notable shift in the country’s approach to digital assets. No capital gains tax on bitcoin has just been passed in The Czech Republic with all members of the parliament voting for it pic.twitter.com/i7E8aZHC2W — Kristian Csepcsar (@KristianCsep) December 6, 2024 The amendment allows individuals to exclude income from personal taxation if their annual crypto earnings are below CZK 100,000 or if their Bitcoin and other digital assets are held for over three years before being sold. However, the exemption excludes electronic cash tokens and applies only to assets not part of business holdings for at least three years after self-employment ends. Hold Your Bitcoin Longer, Pay Less Tax: Czech Republic’s New Crypto Rules Explained These changes align Bitcoin taxation with traditional financial instruments like stocks. Consulting firm BDO highlighted that the amendment mirrors existing exemptions for securities transfers, imposing an aggregate limit of CZK 40 million on gains from securities, business shares, and crypto transactions. Under the current tax system, Bitcoin transactions are taxed at a flat rate of 15% for individuals and 19% for businesses. Higher-income individuals—those earning above CZK 1,935,552 (approximately $81,579)—face a steeper 23% rate. Without transitional provisions, assets acquired before 2025 may qualify for these exemptions when sold under the new rules. Despite these clarifications, questions remain about how taxpayers can confirm the duration of ownership and whether all types of digital assets fall under the scope of the exemptions. The Income Tax Act currently lacks a precise definition for digital assets, leaving room for interpretation. Experts Praise Czech Bitcoin Tax Reform but Call for Clarity Crypto experts, including KPMG, noted that the amendment builds on principles already familiar in securities taxation. BTC Prague reported unanimous support for the law, emphasizing its potential to encourage long-term Bitcoin investments. The Czech Republic actively promotes HODLing by cancelling capital gains tax on #Bitcoin held for longer than 3 years in a unanimous vote! @BraiinsMining Chief of Propaganda @KristianCsep has the details https://t.co/YXUzcDBbbn — BTC Prague (@BTCPrague) December 6, 2024 However, the lack of an explanatory memorandum creates ambiguity around its technical application. As the 2025 implementation date approaches, taxpayers, exchanges, and advisors are expected to review their record-keeping practices to comply with the three-year holding requirement and income limits. Stakeholders have also urged Czech authorities to issue further guidance to eliminate uncertainties surrounding the new framework. The legislation positions the Czech Republic as part of a growing list of nations revising their tax policies to foster crypto adoption.

37299514,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373733,1733509047,Financial Times ‘Apologizes’ to Bitcoin Supporters After Years of Criticism,"The Financial Times (FT) has issued a controversial “apology” after Bitcoin breached the $100,000 mark on December 5, 2024. The apology, published on FT Alphaville, the publication’s daily news commentary service, was perceived by many as a backhanded admission of its failure to foresee Bitcoin’s rise. FT’s ‘Apology’ The article , written by Bryce Elder, City Editor of FT Alphaville, was framed as an apology to those who had, for over a decade, taken the publication’s critical stance on Bitcoin at face value and refrained from investing in the asset. “We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up. It’s nice when your number goes up,” Elder wrote while adding a jab at traditional finance. “We’re sorry if you misunderstood our crypto cynicism to be a declaration of support for tradfi, because we hate that too.” Although the statement was meant to sound like an apology, the tone and wording made many in the crypto community skeptical. The article, published the same day Bitcoin’s price rose above $100,000, seemed more like sarcastic commentary than a genuine apology. The news agency has long been critical of Bitcoin, dating back to its first article on the cryptocurrency, published on June 6, 2011, when the asset was priced at just $15.90. The latest apology article detailed how past FT Alphaville posts had portrayed Bitcoin as a “negative-sum game,” criticizing its inefficiency as a store of value or medium of exchange. The author added that Bitcoin’s value had been viewed as disconnected from utility, and its price was described as an “arbitrary hype gauge.” The post also concluded by maintaining their original position, writing, “We stand by every single one of those posts.” Community Backlash The so-called apology did not sit well with Bitcoin enthusiasts. Many took to X to criticize the Financial Times for issuing a sarcastic “Cope-Pology” instead of a genuine admission of error. One user described it as the “saltiest, most petty apology” they had ever seen, while another person remarked that it was hard to imagine being so wrong and still lacking humility. The Financial Times has consistently maintained its anti-Bitcoin stance. In 2014, the site published a critique of Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, likening them to a “reckless” doctor. The article, written by Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve risk examiner, argued that Bitcoin’s fixed supply failed to account for economic fluctuations. He likened the creator’s approach to giving penicillin to every patient without first checking whether they are suffering from infection, depression, or mania.

37299512,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624001,1733508376,Hong Kong to introduce stablecoin bill to regulate virtual tokens,"The Hong Kong government has published a stablecoin bill in the gazette, bringing the proposed regulatory framework one step closer to becoming law. The city seeks to strike a balance between financial stability and consumer safety while pursuing its virtual asset agenda. On the other hand, China continues to prioritize digital assets that can be controlled. The Chinese authorities, then and now, regard decentralized digital currencies as more destructive than beneficial. The risk stems from crypto’s capacity to hide capital outflows, which Chinese policymakers wish to discourage rather than encourage, as well as its role in money laundering. China is, however, gradually opening up to crypto under its jurisdiction. The publication of the stablecoin bill follows a public consultation held in July by the city’s financial affairs office, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and industry players. Three stablecoin issuers were admitted in July to test its use in various settings. The HKMA will be granted the authority to supervise, investigate, and enforce the regime in order to ensure its effective implementation. The government has announced that the Stablecoins Bill will be introduced into the Legislative Council for a first reading on December 18. Stablecoin introduction in Hong Kong – Details Under the proposed regulatory system, issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins and [other] tokens that claim to maintain a stable value with the Hong Kong dollar will be required to get a license from the HKMA. According to their statement, licenses are also required to publicly sell the issuance of these tokens. Christopher Hui Ching-yu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said in a statement, “The legislative proposal is essential for Hong Kong in fulfilling our obligations as a member of the Financial Stability Board.” He added, “This risk-based proposal aims to promote a robust regulatory environment, which is in line with Hong Kong’s approach to virtual-asset development.” The draft includes information regarding the definition of stablecoins, the licensing application procedure, and transitional arrangements for current stablecoin issuers, among other things. It also prohibits certain activities, such as using misrepresentation to persuade another individual to acquire a stablecoin. According to Andrew Fei, a partner at the law firm King & Wood Mallesons, the framework provides more detail in nearly 300 pages compared to the 30-page consultation document. He explained with an example that the proposed definition of a stablecoin is “ future-proof and comprehensive .” According to him, it encompasses stablecoins that operate on a distributed ledger as well as those that operate on any comparable information repository. In order to fulfill its obligations, a licensed issuer must possess sufficient financial resources and liquid assets, in addition to comprehensive risk-management strategies. For instance, the minimum paid-up capital is the equivalent of US$3.2 million (HK$25 million). The impact of legalizing stablecoins in Hong Kong Lawrence Chu, co-founder of IDA, a Hong Kong-based Web3 digital asset company, believes that the legal framework will provide major opportunities. He said, “Stablecoins can provide cost-effective and efficient cross-border transactions, offering businesses 24/7 digital payment services.” Lawrence Chu further stated that the integration of Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoins into the financial system will enhance the city’s reputation as an international digital asset hub and facilitate cross-border trade. Their aim is that as the globe explores transactions in the Web3 ecosystem, there will be more usage and larger transactions completed or paid for with stablecoins . As a result, Hong Kong regulators are concerned about potential dangers to financial system stability. Hong Kong has also been marked as one of the first countries to regulate stablecoin issuers, following initiatives by the European Union and Japan. Singapore and the United Kingdom are amid developing regulations, whilst the United States currently has no restrictions in place.

37299113,https://crypto.news/?p=14317009,1733508223,2 reasons MSTR stock fell as Bitcoin price rallied,"MicroStrategy stock price has dropped 27% from its highest level this year, despite Bitcoin reaching a record high. MSTR shares were trading at $390 on Dec. 6, continuing a decline that began on Nov. 21, when the stock peaked at $541. Even with this pullback, MicroStrategy remains one of the best-performing stocks this year, up over 500%, with a market cap exceeding $91 billion. It is also the top gainer in the Russell 2000 index. There are two possible reasons why the stock has retreated this month. First, this decline is because of profit-taking among investors who have benefited from its climb. Second, investors are likely concerned about its valuation, which stands at about $91 billion. This is a big premium considering that MicroStrategy holds 402,100 coins valued at under $40 billion. As such, there is a $50 billion gap that cannot be filled by the struggling original data analytics business. You might also like: Bitcoin price can hit $200k in 2025, but crossing $122k will be crucial Therefore, some investors believe that the company’s valuation will ultimately drop to bring its valuation close to its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings. Still, most Wall Street analysts are optimistic that the stock has more upside left. According to Yahoo Finance , some of the most bullish analysts are from Cowen, Barclays, Benchmark, and Bernstein. The average estimate for the stock is $492, higher than the current $390. MicroStrategy’s stock has also mirrored the performance of other Bitcoin-exposed companies. Marathon Digital, the second-largest Bitcoin holder, has declined 14% from its November peak, while Coinbase, Riot Platforms, and Hut 8 Mining have also experienced pullbacks. What next for MSTR stock? MSTR stock chart | Source: TradingView MicroStrategy’s stock has pulled back but remains above the ascending trendline connecting the lowest swings since Nov. 11. It is also trading above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, suggesting potential support for further gains. It has also bottomed at the strong pivot reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Therefore, the stock will likely bounce back if Bitcoin continues rising, as analysts expect . If this happens, the stock will likely continue rising as bulls target the all-time high of $540. A break above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the extreme overshoot level at $625. Conversely, a drop below the rising trendline could see the stock have a mean reversal and drop to the 100-day moving average at $240. This price coincides with the major S&R level of the Murrey Math Lines.

Donald Trump is selling DOGE T-shirts. It's a frenetic time for crypto.  But what are my non-crypto friends texting me about?  ""Hawk Tuah"" coin. Yep, in a very unscientific sample size of the seven friends who texted me — unsolicited — about crypto this week, six essentially asked: ""What's the deal with Hawk Tuah coin?"" (The seventh asked about litecoin).  That a low-level celebrity's dalliance with memecoins would dominate the groupchat's mindshare at the same time the original cryptocurrency smashed through a historic level points to a chasm between the crypto industry's perception of itself and the general public's — or at least my friends' — perception.  When HAWK launched Wednesday, it immediately rocketed up to a market capitalization of almost $500 million. Then, just as fast, it crashed below $100 million, wiping out individual investments once worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. It now fetches less than $30 million.  Betting on memecoins is never a surefire investment strategy. But there were signs that Hawk Tuah was a worse investment than most. Its launch was marred by allegations of insider dumping (which the founders deny) and a pricey swap tax that failed to stop snipers from essentially manipulating its price.  Most of the people who reached out to me didn't know this level of detail. They'd just heard the ""hawk tuah"" woman, Haliey Welch, had launched a memecoin and it did not go very well.  ""It reinforces my previous belief that it's all nonsense,"" said one friend who bought bitcoin in 2020 but quickly sold. He acknowledged that bitcoin and Ethereum's ether may have ""certain technological advances."" And yet, ""​​the fact that essentially anyone can create a new — potentially preferred — cryptocurrency at any point in time"" boggled his mind.  To my surprise, this friend had not heard that one bitcoin was now worth $100,000, the headline story according to most everyone who works inside crypto. Most of the ""normies"" who reached out to me about HAWK didn't know this.  Instead, they wondered if Hawk Tuah would face legal blowback. ""I can't help but feel like [Haliey] Welch is gonna be unintentionally responsible for some butterfly effect that ruins people's lives,"" another friend mused.  Less interesting to him was the price of bitcoin. He wasn't interested in buying before, and certainly not now. ""I don't like crypto,"" he said.  Plenty of people don't like crypto. That may be why plenty of the people I know are so enchanted by HAWK. It reinforces all the bad, scammy notions they have for what they view as digital nonsense nickels.  Of course, that's the promise and peril of permissionless blockchains. Anyone can do anything.  Of the people who reached out to me, only one mentioned bitcoin without prompting. That friend, a gold bug, jokingly taunted me for bitcoin's failure to hold $100k for even 24 hours.  Another friend who buys cryptocurrencies through Robinhood admitted he owed no BTC. ""I don't really have a reason why I have no btc,"" he said, ""I guess im just so not mainstream.""

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world! Pepe Coin Set to Break Resistance as Altcoin Season Approaches Pepe coin is gaining momentum in the crypto market. Its price has jumped nearly 10% in the past week and an impressive 173% over the past month. Currently trading between $0.00001862 and $0.00002462, it’s approaching the nearest resistance level at $0.00002698. If it breaks through, the next target is $0.00003298, offering potential for significant gains. The 10-day moving average of $0.00002148 is above the 100-day average of $0.00002088, indicating upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index sits at 55.50, suggesting there’s room for more buying activity. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, Pepe could see substantial growth soon. XRP Soars with Massive Gains: Ready to Break New Resistance Levels XRP has surged dramatically, rising nearly 390% in the past month and over 395% in six months. Trading between roughly $1.60 and $2.67, it’s approaching the key resistance level just above $3. This upward momentum suggests potential for further gains, possibly reaching the next resistance around $4. Technical indicators like an RSI near 54 show room for growth. With altcoin season on the horizon and a bullish market, XRP could break through these levels, offering substantial returns. Watching its movement around the moving averages can signal a continued uptrend as it aligns with growing market optimism. Bonk (BONK) Poised for Growth Amid Altcoin Season Optimism Bonk (BONK) is showing signs of potential growth as it trades within its current price range of $0.0000409681 to $0.0000501064. With a significant 138.11% increase over the past month, BONK’s momentum is building. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 52.95, indicating neutral to slightly bullish sentiment. If BONK breaks above the nearest resistance level at $0.0000541223, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.0000632606, representing a possible upside of over 25%. The approaching altcoin season and a global crypto bull run could further boost BONK’s price, making it a token to watch closely. Cardano Gains Momentum: Potential Climb Towards $1.64 in Sight In the past week, Cardano (ADA) has seen a price increase of 21.44% and an impressive 276.99% over the past month. Currently trading between $0.96 and $1.25, ADA is approaching the nearest resistance at $1.35. With the Relative Strength Index at 58.42, there’s room for further upward movement. If ADA breaks through the $1.35 level, the next target could be $1.64, representing a significant potential gain. The price is above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, indicating a positive trend. As the altcoin season approaches and the crypto market heats up, Cardano may continue its upward trajectory. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run begins, PEPE, XRP, BONK, and ADA may offer smaller short-term gains. In contrast, DOGEN, crafted for those pursuing luxury and success, expects 700% growth by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Emulating successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits to early adopters.

37299568,https://blockworks.co/news/measuring-dao-grants-for-growth,1733508000,Do DAO grants really work to stimulate growth?,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . One of crypto’s biggest go-to market strengths are tokens. The ability to spin up billions of dollars worth of digital tokens with a click, then use them as lucrative grants to attract users and developers has very much become part of the standard Web3 growth playbook. It works, but the tangible benefits of this spending is hard to measure. Grant money invites extractive rent-seekers, creating a cycle of fleeting capital that rapidly shifts between projects in search of quick gains. As such, DAO grant spending has largely been bogged with inefficiencies. Since November 2023, Arbitrum has distributed 71 million ARB ($81 million) to ecosystem projects through the Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP) grant program . This was a significant expenditure at about 3-4% of Arbitrum’s entire treasury . Treasure DAO co-founder Karel Vuong, who eventually did not participate in STIP due to the grant’s misalignment with gaming applications, called the grant a “double-edged sword.” “While it led to some degree of ecosystem growth and usage as well as learnings to inform a longer-term DAO-led program for incentives, this also came at the cost of increased sell pressure of ARB, poor mitigation of sybilling and decreased value capture resulting from the lower sequencer margin post-ArbOS Atlas upgrade,” Vuong told Blockworks. As part of the Arbitrum Research & Development Committee (ARDC), Blockworks Research conducted a study of STIP’s impact on 17 Arbitrum projects across the verticals of perpetual exchanges, AMM exchanges and yield aggregators. An econometric method known as a “synthetic control” was used to compare real-world Arbitrum to a simulated version that received no grants. In terms of ROI, STIP generated $15.2 million in sequencer revenue for Arbitrum against a $85.2 million marketing spend between November 2023 to March 2024. In sum, Arbitrum’s sequencer revenues would have generated 43% less without STIP. Source: Blockworks Research A subsequent second grant program, the Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP), has to date distributed another 22.87 million ARB ($26 million) to users over 12 weeks. To better track its impact, the metric of “volume-adjusted TVL” was used to better reflect growing TVL numbers that were actually translating into real activity. Simply put, volume-adjusted TVL gives more weight to protocols only when trading volumes are growing faster than TVL. Source: Blockworks Research Based on Blockworks Research studies , LTIPP had a positive impact on sequencer revenues and Arbitrum’s DEX and lending markets, but not its perps markets: We find that, for lending, DEXs, and perps, TVL market share grew by 25%, 17%, and -5% respectively. We find that volume market share grew by 7%, 21%, and -11.38%, respectively. And finally, sequencer revenue market share grew by 6.54%. As one can see, while incentives have a positive impact on DEX, lending and sequencer revenues, they do not have a positive impact on perps.

37298950,https://crypto.news/?p=14317011,1733507940,Ripple targeting year-end RLUSD stablecoin launch: report,"Ripple is pushing to launch its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, by the end of 2024, though regulatory approvals and the holiday season could cause delays. This sentiment comes from Ripple CTO David Schwartz. Speaking at The Block’s Emergence conference in Prague, Schwartz expressed optimism despite challenges. “I’m very hopeful it will happen this year, but once you start running into Christmas and New Year’s, people are gone,” he said, according to The Block. RLUSD was initially announced in April and will operate on both the XRP ( XRP ) Ledger and Ethereum ( ETH ). Testing began in August, and Ripple has partnered with exchanges Uphold, Bitstamp, and Bitso, alongside market makers B2C2 and Keyrock, to ensure liquidity.

37300442,https://thecoinrise.com/solana-etf-heres-why-secs-new-stance-could-delay-approval/,1733507900,Solana ETF: Here’s Why SEC’s New Stance Could Delay Approval,"The excitement surrounding a potential Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) has taken a major hit. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is raising new developments. The agency revealed that the approval process for this highly anticipated product may only move forward for a while. This setback follows a flurry of optimism sparked by Grayscale’s involvement in the Solana ETF proceedings . However, it seems the hopes of the Solana community may be dashed, at least for now. SEC Puts Brakes on Solana ETF Approval According to FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, speculation has emerged that the SEC has delivered a grim update to the Solana ETF applicants . Citing an undisclosed source, Terrett reported that the SEC notified at least two applicants their Solana ETF proposals would not advance. This decision indicates that the SEC will not move forward with the Solana ETF under the current administration. Also, this development suggests that the SEC’s preliminary decision, expected in January 2025, will likely be unfavorable. The update came after weeks of mounting optimism, fueled by Grayscale’s involvement in the ETF push. This news has left the Solana community shocked. The setback leaves applicants uncertain as they await potential approval in the future under different regulatory conditions. SEC Maintains Tough Stance Against ETF Approval The root of this setback lies in a shift in the SEC’s internal consensus. Under the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC has signaled that it will not approve any new crypto ETFs during this administration. Despite approving the first-ever crypto spot ETFs, Bitcoin in January and Ethereum in July, the SEC seems hesitant to approve more. The agency appears cautious about expanding its approval of crypto-related products. This new consensus within the SEC suggests that applications for Solana, XRP , and other cryptocurrency-based ETFs will face significant hurdles. What Does This Mean for Solana’s ETF and Other Cryptocurrencies? The impact of this new SEC direction is significant for the broader crypto market. Solana, which has long been seen as a promising candidate for its own ETF, will have to wait for a more favorable regulatory environment. However, the Solana ETF is not alone in this predicament. Other cryptocurrencies with ETF applications, including XRP, will face similar delays. However, the precise timing of the next SEC decision remains uncertain. Some market analysts are cautiously optimistic that once the new administration takes office, there will be a more crypto-friendly regulatory stance. If this occurs, the timeline for the launch of Solana and other crypto ETFs could be pushed back to late 2025. The incoming administration’s potential support for digital assets and more comprehensive regulations may be the key to turning the tide for these highly anticipated products.

37298853,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311831,1733507741,USDC Becomes First Stablecoin To Gain Compliance With New Canadian Crypto Asset Requirements,"Circle announced this week that USDC became the first stablecoin to gain compliance with new Canadian digital asset regulations. Canada’s new regulations call for delisting noncompliant stablecoins after December 31st. Circle’s compliance means USDC, which aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, can trade on crypto exchanges in the Canadian market, according to a new press release . Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, says the new development underscores the stablecoin issuer’s regulatory efforts. “The Canadian Securities Administrators’ proactive approach in providing a digital asset regulatory framework reinforces the integrity of digital asset markets, while ensuring continued reliance on USDC across Canada’s burgeoning ecosystem.” The announcement comes as Circle launched a new wave of layoffs, Bloomberg reports . A company spokesperson tells the news outlet the downsizing was routine and represented less than 6% of the firm’s workforce. “Circle regularly reviews our investments and expenses. This includes investing in teams and operational infrastructure that need to grow, while marginally reducing spend and some roles in other areas of the business.” This summer, USDC and Circle’s euro-pegged stablecoin EURC also achieved compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations. MiCA is upcoming EU legislation that will provide rules covering the supervision, consumer protection and environmental safeguards of crypto assets. The law includes measures that aim to reduce financial crimes including market manipulation, money laundering and terrorist financing, and it places stablecoin issuers under the European Banking Authority while requiring them to hold sufficient liquid reserves. It’s also scheduled to take effect in December 2024.

37298784,https://finbold.com/?p=217424,1733507625,These 2 startups are using blockchain to revolutionize travel and payments,"Cryptocurrencies usually get the headlines due to price action, market movements, or scams, but the technology goes far beyond that. The blockchain has the power to revolutionize many segments of our society and life, such as travel and trivial payments. In particular, two startups – built on Algorand ( ALGO ) – are using blockchain to innovate on airline tickets and energy bill payments. These startups are TravelX and HesabPay, featured in the Algorand Foundation’s new campaign “Algorand Can” as evidence of what blockchain technology can do in the real world, especially when using ALGO’s infrastructure. Essentially, Algorand is a blockchain platform designed for speed, scalability, and security, competing with Ethereum ( ETH ) and other “layer-ones (L1s).” It uses a pure proof-of-stake consensus model and has a supply cap set at 10 billion ALGO. These characteristics can leverage startups like TravelX and HesabPay with efficient and secure solutions for their needs. Finbold looked at publicly available stats from these businesses, showing the impact they are already bringing to the real world. TravelX – Using Algorand NFTs for airplane tickets TravelX is using Algorand’s blockchain to run “NFTickets” for airline travel, aiming to solve known issues in this industry. According to its case study , “Airlines face operational cost burdens managing complex distribution networks and numerous intermediaries.” “NFTickets, governed by smart contracts, provide secure, flexible, and efficient ticket distribution while reducing customer service costs and increasing airline revenue. The use of blockchain provides enhanced security, transparency, and immutability to travel transactions.” – Algorand Foundation’s TravelX case study Notably, TravelX claims to have onboarded over 5 million passengers in 2023, being a battle-tested case of success. Since its launch, the startup has recorded over 2.2 million NFTickets and 18 million transactions on the Algorand blockchain. “This eliminates the risk of fraud and fosters trust between airlines and passengers, ensuring all parties involved have clear and verifiable records. NFTs represent unique, secure, and transferable digital ownership of airline tickets, offering passengers greater control over their travel plans.” – Algorand Foundation’s TravelX case study Besides increased security, eliminating the risk of fraud, and providing true digital ownership of the tickets, the benefits go further. TravelX also leverages a safe environment for secondary markets and more flexibility for its customers than conventional airline ticketing systems. “Unlike traditional tickets, NFTickets can be easily transferred or even resold on secondary markets, providing passengers with increased flexibility. Smart contracts automate ticket functionalities and interactions, such as managing ticket changes or cancellations. This automation leads to reduced operational costs and improved efficiency for airlines.” – Algorand Foundation’s TravelX case study HesabPay – Afghanistan energy bill payments via ALGO Meanwhile, HesabPay, in partnership with UNDP and Unicef, is using the Algorand network to foster digital payments’ accessibility in Afghanistan. According to data shared at the “Can A Blockchain Do That” website, the app has processed over $64 million worth of electricity bills and 106,000 humanitarian cash transfers in the country, resulting in over 8 million transactions confirmed by the Algorand blockchain. HesabPay stats. Source: canablockchaindothat.com On that note, Alex, an Algorand contributor, shared that HesabPay has processed $40 million in electricity monthly bills. This, according to Alex and Algorand Foundation’s CMO, Marc Vanlerberghe, equals 30% of all Afghanistan electricity bills. 30% of electricity bills are paid each month in Afghanistan using #Algorand , via @HesabPay_ ! ⚡️ We're talking about hundreds of millions of $ annually. This is a perfect example of a concrete blockchain use case, not counted in TVL, used by millions of users outside of #web3 ! pic.twitter.com/Ax62GnQbeN — Ⱥlex | france.algo 🇫🇷 (@algerstmehn) November 28, 2024 As things develop, startups continue to use blockchain technology in different chains, proving that crypto is about solving real-world problems. Finbold covered three other interesting use cases built on top of MultiversX ( EGLD ), for example. In the meantime, cryptocurrency analysts are showing growing optimism about “utility altcoins” like ALGO, EGLD, ETH, and others. Alex Becker believes “utility altcoins” are the “ easiest and surest play ” in crypto. Additionally, Alex Svanevik listed promising utility narratives in what he called an upcoming “ mother of all bull markets .” Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), urged the industry to build real-world applications as meme coins started to become “weird.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

Altcoins have embarked on another rally with established cryptos SHIB and SOL leading on the rebound list. SOL broke out of the $220s to reach $240 in the last 24 hours. SHIB’s steady growth eyes $1. Monsta Mash ($MASH) joined early with a successful presale that has dominated crypto stories. Its combined gaming and yields platform brings a confluence of captivating gameplay and crypto earnings, sparking interest in the gaming community and investors. How soon will its utility token $MASH rally to $10? SHIB’s Uninterrupted Upswing Eyeing $1 SHIB’s growing positive sentiments and increased market activity have led to a 22.00% increase in daily trading volume. After gaining 81.8% in the past month and 5.5% in the last 24 hours, SHIB is trading at $0.00003179. A recent 7418% token burn rate in one week combined with ecosystem upgrades like Shibarium Hard Fork has contributed to the meme coin’s notable positive performance. Analysts have debated over the crypto’s ability to a 1000% rally this season which if achieved could get it closer to $1. Solana Aiming for $600 SOL has shown a strong rebound signal after trading closer to $240, a first step out of its recent bearish trend. The coin pulled back after recording a $263.21 ATH on November 23rd. With increased traffic on its network as the preferred platform for dApps and new token launches, Solana’s long-term growth could be sealed. The growing demand for SOL within the blockchain could soon get its price to $600.

With its fixed supply and growing demand driven by rising investor confidence and adoption as a payments technology, Bitcoin is positioned as a unique addition to investment portfolios by offering low correlation to traditional risk assets such as stocks and bonds, according to the report. The report notes that Bitcoin’s value is driven by different factors, including its limited supply and its potential for widespread adoption. BlackRock says: “Bitcoin’s potential as a new diversifier stems from its unique value drivers: the potential to appreciate over time as its predetermined supply is met by increasing demand, and demand is driven by investors’ belief in Bitcoin’s potential for wider adoption as a payments technology.” Related News: Analyst il Capo Reveals What to Expect Next in Bitcoin Price! Is a Correction Coming? What to Expect in Altcoins? The asset manager also points to Bitcoin’s resilience as a potential buffer in an increasingly volatile market environment. As correlations between stocks and bonds weaken, traditional safe havens like gold and emerging assets like Bitcoin could fill the gap left by government bonds that have become less effective as a hedge against stock sell-offs, analysts say. Bitcoin’s historically low correlation with equity markets increases its appeal as a diversifier, but its risk-return profile could change with wider adoption, according to BlackRock. The report highlights: “The risk and return profile of Bitcoin will change if it becomes widely adopted. At that point, it may be more suitable as a tactical hedge against certain risks, like gold.” *This is not investment advice.

Important statements were made by FED members Hammack and Goolsbee, touching on interest rates, economic growth, and Bitcoin's role in the financial ecosystem. Hammack emphasized a data-driven approach to monetary policy, noting that the U.S. economy remains strong with solid growth, low unemployment and gradually decreasing inflation, adding that “the economic situation requires moderately restrictive monetary policy.” Hammack hinted that the Fed may slow the pace of rate cuts, in line with market expectations that there will be a single rate cut at the next two Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. “The time has come, or will soon come, for the Fed to slow the pace of rate cuts,” Hammack said. The member added that the outlook for financial markets was consistent with his view, suggesting a less aggressive stance as inflationary pressures ease and the labor market stabilizes. Meanwhile, Fed member Goolsbee addressed cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, arguing that its high volatility prevents it from functioning effectively as a currency. Related News: Analyst il Capo Reveals What to Expect Next in Bitcoin Price! Is a Correction Coming? What to Expect in Altcoins? “Bitcoin’s attractive volatility prevents it from being a currency because it is not a stable store of value,” Goolsbee said. Goolsbee also expressed skepticism about the broader economic impact of cryptocurrencies, describing them as speculative assets with limited real-world applications: “So far, the rise of crypto assets hasn’t had much of a macro impact, but there could be a wealth impact.” Regarding the FED's intervention in Bitcoin, Hammack explained that the FED follows developments regarding cryptocurrencies but does not have a direct relationship with Bitcoin. Both officials said that incoming data is important in shaping the Fed's decisions. Hammack took a clear stance on the December FOMC meeting, saying additional data on inflation and consumer spending would influence the final decision. *This is not investment advice.

37298633,https://finbold.com/?p=217419,1733507221,Sell signal for 2 overbought cryptocurrencies this week,"The cryptocurrency market faced significant turbulence today as Bitcoin ( BTC ) suffered a dramatic flash crash , plunging from its all-time high of $103,000 to as low as $94,000 before stabilizing around $97,000. This sharp decline triggered a wave of panic sell-offs, impacting major altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ) and XRP , which mirrored Bitcoin’s downward trajectory. The resulting liquidation frenzy has pushed market-wide liquidations to a staggering $881 million, further intensifying bearish sentiment. While the exact catalyst for this sell-off remains unclear, heightened volatility has spotlighted overbought conditions in several cryptocurrencies. According to CoinGlass’s 12-hour relative strength index ( RSI ), heatmap , multiple assets have breached overbought thresholds, presenting opportunities for short-term corrections. ‘ With the average daily RSI currently at 70.36 and the 12-hour RSI at 65.55, the broader market shows signs of overheating, increasing the likelihood of retracements in select assets. Against this backdrop, Finbold has identified two cryptocurrencies, Xai (XAI) and JasmyCoin ( JASMY ), that exhibit strong sell signals based on momentum indicators, suggesting they may be poised for imminent price corrections. Xai (XAI) XAI’s current RSI levels across multiple timeframes point to an emerging sell signal as overbought conditions dominate the higher timeframes. The 12-hour RSI has surged to 71.59, while the 24-hour RSI climbs even higher to 74.1, both breaching the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates that buying momentum is reaching its peak, with a pullback or consolidation likely on the horizon. Crypto Market RSI 12-hour Heatmap: XAI. Source: CoinGlass Adding to this, a sharp 9.75% price increase over the last 12 hours suggests the asset may be overextended, inviting selling pressure as traders begin to secure profits. While shorter timeframes, such as the 15-minute RSI at 56.88 and the one-hour RSI at 55.59, remain in neutral territory, they fail to show the strong upward momentum needed to sustain further gains. With the broader market’s average 12-hour RSI standing at 65.55, which is on the verge of overbought levels, XAI’s upward trend could face resistance, signaling a key moment for traders to take profits before a potential correction sets in. JasmyCoin (JASMY) JASMY also presents strong sell signals, with RSI levels across multiple timeframes firmly in overbought territory. The 12-hour RSI stands at 75.71, the 24-hour RSI at 76.77, and the one-week RSI at 75.55, all exceeding the overbought threshold of 70. These readings indicate that JASMY’s recent bullish momentum is unsustainable and likely to reverse soon. Crypto Market RSI 12-hour Heatmap: JASMY. Source: CoinGlass Adding to this bearish outlook, JASMY has seen an extraordinary 73.2% price surge over the past 12 hours, a sharp spike that typically triggers profit-taking. Shorter timeframes, such as the 15-minute RSI of 45.61 and one-hour RSI of 50.41, remain neutral, signaling that the upward momentum is not strong enough to sustain further gains. With the broader market’s 12-hour RSI average at 65.55, the potential for selling pressure across the market increases. These factors make JASMY a prime candidate for a short-term correction, presenting traders with an opportunity to secure gains. However, it is important to note that an overbought RSI is not a definitive predictor of an immediate downturn, as such conditions can persist in prolonged bullish markets. Therefore, while caution is warranted, traders should also consider broader market trends and additional indicators to make informed decisions. In the current backdrop, closely monitoring market dynamics will be crucial for navigating the heightened volatility.

Certik noted both the number of hacks and the crypto stolen declined for the second month in a row. Hacks and exploits have been on the decline since September. November’s result shows a total of 50 successful attacks with an estimated value of $65M. Data by Certik shows a two-month streak of declining attacks, despite the record market value of crypto assets. November was also the second-slowest month when it came to direct crypto hacks. Hacks decline in November 2024 compared to November 2023 Certik’s estimate for November is the most conservative, based on its methodology. The Web3 auditing firm tracks big exploits against DeFi, protocols, and enterprise wallets. Certik also excludes decentralized and trading attacks, including sandwich attacks, flash loan trades, and rug pulls. Other estimates that include a wider selection of hacks tally up the losses to $71M or even up to $85M. The result for November 2024 is still smaller compared to November 2023, where a total of $343M was lost, based on estimates by ImmuneFi. November 2023 was a notable month, with a $118M hack against the Poloniex exchange. In comparison, November 2024 shows a slowdown of big exploits and a turn toward small DEX and DeFi protocols. November also saw an acceleration of attacks directed at personal wallets through malicious links, supply chain attacks, or social phishing. According to ScamSniffer data, 9,208 victims were affected in small-scale exploits against personal wallets. A total of $9.3M were lost. Hacks slow down, on track to remain below 2023 levels Hacks and exploits on a year-to-date basis make up to $1.49B in a total of 209 notable incidents, with the most activity around mid-2024. For now, the year’s exploits are smaller compared to 2023 with a total of $1.7B. Peak activity for crypto exploits happened in 2022 when hackers took hold of more than $3.7B. Besides the bear market, one of the factors was a slowdown of the Lazarus Group activity, at least based on the usage of TornadoCash. The other reason is an attempt to shift exploits to the Solana ecosystem, while Ethereum is still the biggest target for exploits. Tornado Cash deposits slowed down since the sanctions verdict in 2022. | Source: Dune Analytics Activity on Tornado Cash fell off a cliff in 2022, after the OFAC sanctions verdict. Even after the verdict was overturned in 2022, the mixer did not regain its original volume . TornadoCash remains the most widely used for Ethereum-based ERC-20 assets. TornadoCash, however, remains key to mixing funds, with recent deposits from the DEXX hack getting sent in test transactions. Hacks become more detailed and creative The biggest hack for November was DEXX, which exposed thousands of Solana wallets and led to a loss of $30M. The DEXX hack exposed 8,620 Solana wallets as a result of social engineering to steal private keys. Thala Labs was the second-biggest hack in November, for a total of $25.5M. The exploit was white-hatted, later allowing the platform to recover its funds after deducting a $300K bug bounty. Gifto was a questionable hack, where new tokens were printed and sold on exchanges. Polter Finance lost $12M in an Oracle exploit, while Delta Prime erased $4.8M in a contract exploit. MetaWin was another mid-range hack, where a smart contract allowed for oversized withdrawals. The betting platform lost $4M from its permissionless withdrawal contract. The smallest hack was XT Exchange , losing between $1M and $1.7M from compromised wallets. Certik, whose main task is private contract audits, noted November arrived with multiple exploits based on flawed logic. Audits do not always guarantee a contract will not be exploited, but a total lack of audits may be an easy target for hackers. At the same time, bridge hacks and exploits have almost disappeared, as projects rarely use bridge activity and have siloed their liquidity.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $3,600; now up ~54% year-to-date. XRP has wiped out its losses this year and is currently up ~301% year-to-date. This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Bitcoin's closing price climbed toward the $100,000 level this past week. BTC is currently up ~117% year-to-date. Ether Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain platform and has the second-largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article, with its launch in July 2015. Ether's price climbed higher, ending above $3,600. ETH is now up ~54% year-to-date. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple ( XRP-USD ) and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We've included it in this article for reference. XRP has wiped out its losses this year and is currently up ~301% year-to-date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Bitcoin tops the chart. In other words, the price of a bitcoin has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies. On January 10th, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR).

Data from Coinglass shows that Ethereum witnessed total liquidation of nearly $87 million over the last 24 hours. In March 2024, the launch of the Dencun upgrade drastically cut fees for Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling solutions, resulting in a 99% decline in Ethereum layer-1 network revenues. The reduction in fees initially led to less demand for the smart contract-based cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, by September 2024, network fees began to increase again. Also read: Ethereum Breaks Through $4,000 Amid Growing Demand For ETH ETF Data from Token Terminal shows that on December 5, the Ethereum base layer collected about $11 million in fees. In contrast, during the peak of fee suppression in August 2024, Ethereum’s fees were around $500,000. The surge in Ethereum’s price is driven by rising demand for Ethereum ETFs, which saw a record daily net inflow exceeding $430 million on December 5, as reported by CoinGlass. In the last week, Ethereum ETFs have gained more than $1 billion in inflows, with BlackRock contributing $788 million of that total, as per data from Farside Investors. Significant inflows into major Ethereum ETFs are occurring amid increasing bullish analysis. In November, Plume CEO Chris Yin explained that anticipation of more favorable crypto regulations under President-elect Donald Trump is sparking “overdue excitement” for these funds, which started trading in the U.S. in July. What’s Next for ETH Price? Ethereum price is currently showing a strong buying pattern, breaking through the $4K mark. Buyers are now aiming to hold the price above that level to validate further upswings. As of writing, ETH price trades at $4,016, surging over 2.5% in the last 2 hours. The upward trending 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $3,837 and a positive relative strength index (RSI) suggest that the bulls currently have a slight upper hand. If Ethereum breaks above the upper boundary and closes there, it could trigger a rally potentially reaching above $4,400, with targets at $4,800. Conversely, if Ethereum breaks and closes below the EMA20 trend line, it would signal a shift in advantage to the bears, potentially leading to a drop towards $3,500 and possibly further to $2,700. Should these support levels fail, the next critical level could be the 50-day simple moving average at $2,200.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-proceeds-toward-new-all-time-high-amid-etf-demand-will-eth-price-succeed/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In a recent opinion piece published in Bloomberg , Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2009 to 2018, highlighted challenges with a government-backed Bitcoin reserve . Limited Benefits, Significant Drawbacks “Bitcoin has some positive attributes,” said Dudley. “It can be transferred to anyone, anywhere without relying on government-regulated banks or other traditional financial intermediaries. And adding it to a portfolio of stocks and bonds might provide some diversification benefit.” Should the US government buy 1 million Bitcoin? Absolutely not, says former New York Fed President Bill Dudley https://t.co/i2Zr7asRn6 — Bloomberg Opinion (@opinion) December 6, 2024 Despite these merits, Dudley argued that creating a federal Bitcoin reserve would likely cause prices to skyrocket, benefiting current Bitcoin holders rather than the broader economy. He emphasized Bitcoin’s capped supply and absence of income generation, describing it as a speculative and volatile asset. Dudley further explained that funding such an initiative would come at a high cost. Financing Bitcoin purchases through debt or money creation would either increase the national debt or exacerbate inflation. He compared this to monetizing debt, an approach that carries serious economic risks. He also questioned Bitcoin’s practicality as a government asset, citing its slow transaction speeds, high energy costs, and lack of guaranteed acceptance as major drawbacks. Instead of pursuing a Bitcoin reserve, Dudley urged policymakers to focus on regulatory frameworks that address issues in the cryptocurrency market. He advocated for measures to protect consumers, prevent illicit activities, and promote the safe development of blockchain technology . Florida Could Launch Bitcoin Reserve in Q1 2025 While Dudley criticized the concept of a federal Bitcoin reserve, some states appear to be moving in a different direction. According to Samuel Armes, President of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA), the State of Florida could launch its own Bitcoin reserve as early as the first quarter of 2025. @samuelarmes of the Florida Blockchain Business Association says Florida could establish a Bitcoin reserve by Q1 2025. #USCrypto #FloridaCrypto #BitcoinReserve https://t.co/P1RINJQEPK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 6, 2024 Armes suggested that Florida’s pro-crypto leadership, including Governor Ron DeSantis and lawmakers Danny Perez and Ben Albritton, may explore using the state’s pension fund and budget surplus to invest in Bitcoin.

The documents, which were obtained as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, include letters that encouraged banks to “pause all crypto asset-related activity.” The purported regulatory action resulted in delays or complete halts to plans by banks to offer cryptocurrency services, causing significant burdens on the crypto industry. Coinbase says the letters demonstrate a lack of transparency and a lack of clarity from regulators , which has led to tension between crypto companies and federal regulators. The FDIC’s instructions apparently called for banks to resolve thorny compliance issues before taking up any crypto-related business, resulting in a practical freeze on the industry. Crypto’s Rocky Relationship With Banking For years, the firms of cryptocurrency have been trying to have decent banking relationships in place within the U.S. Banks were continuing to stay away out of a lack of regulatory clarity, fraud concerns, and potential reputational risk. All that leaves many crypto businesses without the financial infrastructure to operate. The recently disclosed FDIC communications further underscore this strained relationship. By placing burdensome requirements on banks, the agency has reportedly deterred institutions from exploring partnerships with crypto businesses. The lack of formalized crypto guidelines has created an environment of uncertainty, where banks prefer to avoid the sector altogether rather than risk non-compliance. Operation Chokepoint 2.0: Fact or Fiction? Coinbase claims these moves are part of a wider effort that it refers to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” The term alludes to allegations of federal regulators surreptitiously trying to choke the crypto industry by cutting off its access to critical banking services. Critics contend such measures inappropriately insulate legitimate crypto businesses, ultimately stifling innovation and undermining growth in the industry. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, underlined the importance of these revelations: “The letters show Operation Chokepoint 2.0 wasn’t some crypto conspiracy theory. The FDIC must answer for its overreach.” Clear Crypto Guidelines: A Need Meanwhile, crypto leaders are clamoring for clear, consistent regulations to replace these vague and unofficial restrictions. He urged rulemakers to adopt guidelines that allow law-abiding cryptocurrency companies to have fair access to banking without politically driven regulatory actions that will adversely affect their businesses. In the interim, the FDIC’s actions reignited long-running debates over the role of government in or around the stifling of financial innovation, and the crypto world wants an easier onramp into legitimacy with traditional banks.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/us-government-pressured-banks-crypto-coinbase/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

37297945,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623991,1733505626,India folds on the de-dollarization agenda and could fail the BRICS currency,"Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das has announced that India is not pursuing a de-dollarization policy. He also emphasized that no concrete decisions have been made regarding the creation of a common BRICS currency. As Forbes reported , India’s central bank head has confirmed that de-dollarization is not part of the country’s objectives under the BRICS group. Das’ remarks come in the wake of sharp criticism from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose a 100% tariff on BRICS nations if they attempt to replace the dollar in international trade. India’s approach to currency use During a press briefing , Das addressed questions on India’s stance, clarifying that the country has only sought local currency trade agreements to mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single currency. “Dependence on one currency can be problematic at times because of appreciation or depreciation,” Das explained but stressed that India’s actions are aimed at diversification rather than outright de-dollarization. He noted that one of the group’s members introduced the concept of a BRICS currency, but no progress has been made. “The geographical spread of the countries has also to be kept in mind, unlike the eurozone which has geographical contiguity,” he added. India’s cautious stance on de-dollarization and the BRICS currency initiative raises questions about the bloc’s long-term unity and vision. The country’s cooperation is especially pivotal to the BRICS framework, particularly for Russia and China, as it serves as a bridge between diverse geopolitical and economic interests. India and Russia have formed strong ties in sectors like energy and defense, with $68 billion in bilateral commerce, mostly from cheaper imports of Russian petroleum. The potential for economic cooperation is evident in strategic initiatives like the Chennai-Vladivostok maritime corridor and the International North-South Transport Corridor. However, India’s pragmatic approach, balancing relationships with both the West and Russia, adds complexity, especially amid ongoing global tensions such as the Ukraine conflict. China and India, as the largest BRICS economies, also stand to benefit from their cooperation within the bloc. However, their partnership is nuanced by tension from underlying geopolitical challenges that led the countries to war in 2020 in the Ladakh region. BRICS expansion and currency debate BRICS, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, expanded last year to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE. The move was not supported by India, which believes the bloc needs time to “adjust to new members.” At its most recent summit in Kazan, Russia, BRICS leaders unveiled a symbolic banknote, signaling support for the use of local currencies in bilateral trade agreements. Still, the notion of a common trade currency remains highly contentious. Earlier this year, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva advocated for a BRICS currency to challenge the dollar’s dominance. However, critics, including RBI governor Das, have pointed to the complexity of creating such a currency across a geographically and economically diverse bloc. The debate intensified after Trump, via his Truth Social platform, warned that any move by BRICS nations to establish a common trade currency or undermine the dollar would trigger severe economic repercussions. Source: X “There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in international trade, and any country that tries should wave goodbye to America,” Trump wrote. Governor Das declined to comment on Trump’s remarks directly, stating, “Let the policy come first.” Economist says BRICS has a common currency in Gold While the BRICS bloc is not currently planning a common currency, economist and author Jim Rickards argued that they already share a de facto currency: gold. According to Rickards, BRICS countries rely on national currencies like the yuan and ruble for trade but use gold for periodic settlements to balance accounts. Rickards described Trump’s tariff threats as more of a warning than a reaction to an immediate threat. He suggested that if he were in charge of the U.S. Treasury, he would prioritize purchasing gold to complicate the efforts of BRICS nations, effectively preempting their chances of relying on a gold-based trade system.

This new Jordan Belfort-themed Pepe coin is popping champagne as its presale total raise soars past $600K in its opening 48 hours. The crypto market has a new green friend – and it has emerged at the perfect time. But WEPE isn’t just here to piggyback on the success of Pepe coin and the wider crypto market. He’s here to change things. Yes, Pepe has provided a 163% gain this month and Bitcoin 49%. But most of that liquidity has been sucked by whales. The little guys are left counting marginal sums of money when all is said and done. That’s where Wall Street Pepe comes in. It’s an army of “little guys” who are choosing rich. Equipped with a suite of market-beating tools, Wall Street Pepe enables all users to trade Pepe like a winner. To join the community and get ahead of the market, someone only needs to hold WEPE. The presale offers the perfect opportunity, potentially at the lowest price we’ll ever see. It’s currently available at $0.000202, but this will rise throughout the ICO, with the next increase in two days. Crypto prices soar, but WEPE empowers investors to get ahead Many feel left behind as the crypto market adds trillions while their portfolios fail to generate the life-changing riches they hoped for. They’re not alone. While crypto whales get stinking rich as Bitcoin, Dogecoin , and Shiba Inu rally, everyday investors are underwhelmed. It’s even the same story with Pepe. It’s up 163% this month – if someone invested in April 2023, they’d be up 115,000% today. A $10K investment would now be worth $200 million. But suppose they invested $10K in late May of 2024 – they’d be up less than 50%. It’s good, but it’s not Lambo money. Yet for a whale with tens of millions invested, a 50% gain is a lot of money. Whales have an unfair advantage. Their increased capital means they don’t need to generate multiple Xs to print big gains. But Wall Street Pepe is here to help the little guy, providing a springboard for them to choose rich and reach whale status. It’s not just a Wall Street-esque Pepe reboot – Wall Street Pepe is creating an army of hungry traders and equipping them with market-leading tools and data insights to compete with and even outmaneuver current crypto whales.

There’s also a whale insider group where users can converse and craft profit-maximizing plans. Members can create strategies, share alpha, and stay up to date on the latest WEPE news – essentially beating whales at their own game. Users can also submit their own trading ideas to the team, and if approved, they’ll get paid with free WEPE tokens. WEPE holders can also grow their portfolio by staking their tokens.

WEPE is the opportunity to catch the next 115,000% meme coin Pepe secured a 115,000% gain with little more than ‘vibes.’ But what happens when users take that energy, mix in the lore of Jordan Belfort, and use it to build an army of aspiring whales? We’re about to see exactly that – and with Bitcoin crossing $100K – all eyes are on crypto right now. Millions of new users are about to enter the industry, so those who buy WEPE today could see newcomers pump up their bags just like they did for early Pepe investors.

Solana (SOL): A High-Performance Blockchain for Scalable Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability and speed, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. It stands out by enabling faster transactions without relying on sharding or second-layer solutions. Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, powering programs, and rewarding network participants. The platform supports development across multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. With its high-capacity network designed for hosting high-activity products and services, Solana has potential in the blockchain space. In the current market cycle, its emphasis on scalability and performance makes it a noteworthy option for developers and users interested in decentralized applications. Ethereum’s Path to Scalability: Proof-of-Stake and Layer 2 Innovations Ethereum is a leading Proof-of-Stake blockchain launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. It enables smart contracts and hosts a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, including DeFi platforms. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, widely used for governance and utility across various applications. To enhance transaction efficiency, Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon are employed. The transition to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 marked a significant evolution. Upcoming implementations like sharding aim to improve scalability and reduce costs, reinforcing Ethereum’s focus on decentralization and efficiency. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Ethereum’s price is predicted to increase, which may influence its perception in the current market cycle. Conclusion Ethereum and Solana may offer less short-term potential. DOGEN, a meme token for those seeking luxury and success, is expected to grow 700% by the presale’s end, with potential thousand-fold returns. Following successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders aiming to dominate, offering real benefits and perks for early adopters.

Trading at $0.4500 as of December 5, the memecoin has surged by an impressive 450% from its annual low. This rally has brought DOGE’s market capitalization to over $65 billion, making it one of the top contenders in the crypto space. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst The query that is on everyone’s mind is straightforward: Is this simply the calm before the storm? Analysts appear to concur. Symptoms Of A Potential Breakout People are drawing parallels to earlier accumulation cycles in Dogecoin’s price action, which has been consolidating for 21 days along an important green trendline. According to market watchers, the most recent major cycle broke out following 25 days of relatively unchanged trading patterns. DOGE might be setting up for another massive spike if past events are any indication. $Doge #Doge Getting Ready For Another Bullish Wave Formed Bullish Pennant Expecting Another 20-25% After Successful Breakout https://t.co/9aTZtkzEpG pic.twitter.com/m8reCEhdyJ — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) December 5, 2024 The ongoing Bitcoin rally is further exacerbating this speculation. Bitcoin has recently surpassed the significant $100,000 threshold, which has reignited interest in the cryptocurrency market. In the past, Dogecoin has exhibited a propensity to emulate Bitcoin’s movements, frequently participating in the tidal surge of heightened institutional interest and market enthusiasm. 💫 #DOGE IMPORTANT UPDATE: I’ve overlaid the #DOGE chart from the previous cycle, when it first interacted with the green trendline, onto the current cycle for comparison. In the previous cycle, it took 25 days of consolidation before a significant breakout occurred. If history… pic.twitter.com/ZK05PgUOL8 — Master Kenobi (@btc_MasterPlan) December 4, 2024 Greed And Whales: A Recipe For Action? Whale activity also indicates that Dogecoin may not be finished yet. Based on recent data, major holders transferred more than $3 million in DOGE in a single day, suggesting that accumulation is ongoing. This is consistent with the current state of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which currently sits at 85, firmly within the “Extreme Greed” zone. The Altcoin Season Index is consistently increasing, reflecting the equally optimistic broader market sentiment. During periods of market exuberance, investors are increasingly focusing on meme coins such as Dogecoin, recognizing them as high-risk, high-reward investments. Bold Prognosis In The Face Of Cautious Optimism There is a lot of conjecture surrounding Dogecoin’s future price objective. Based on past data, seasoned traders have set ambitious profit zones between $10 and $30, while some analysts predict that it will soon approach the psychological level of $1. However, not all forecasts are overly optimistic. A mild estimate, which projects that DOGE’s price will drop by 5.76% to $0.409 by early 2025, reflects the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Despite this, Dogecoin has had 63% of the trading days in the last month that have been favorable, which helps to reinforce its position as a strong competitor in the altcoin market. Dogecoin’s capacity to transition between times of consolidation and whale-driven activity makes it a coin to keep a constant watch on. Regardless of whether it reaches new highs or falls, its ongoing story will continue to captivate cryptocurrency enthusiasts throughout the world. Related Reading: Market Expert: Not Long On XRP? You’re ‘Disrespecting’ Yourself So, How High Can DOGE Go? Now, the question is: before the year ends, how high may Dogecoin rise? Everything appears feasible given its past propensity to startle the markets and a present backdrop of great investor mood. Although $1 is the immediate psychological aim, if market conditions match bold predictions suggest profit zones between $10 and $30 are not totally out of reach. Whether Dogecoin meets resistance or reaches these high targets, its path remains among the most fascinating narratives in the cryptocurrency field.

Recent moves have seen Arbitrum (ARB) price rally by crossing the $1 mark, showing its steady price growth. At the same time, Polkadot (DOT) price gains are bringing it closer to the crucial $10 mark, a level that could spark significant action from traders. On the other side, market analysts are closely watching BlockDAG (BDAG) , a new presale hitter that has already raised $157.5 million in just a few months. With BDAG coin prices skyrocketing by 2240% and a recently launched 5-tier bonus system offering rewards on BDAG purchases starting at 150% and so on, BlockDAG emerges as the best crypto to buy now, delivering unparalleled potential for early adopters. Yet, with the ongoing presale surge, the big question remains will BDAG reach its ambitious $600 million presale target in the coming months? Let’s find out Arbitrum (ARB) Price Rally: From $0.649 to $1 – What’s Next? The recent Arbitrum (ARB) price rally has gained attention with its steady upward movement and consistent price growth. Starting its climb at $0.649, ARB recently broke past the $1 mark. The rally gained momentum on November 21, crossing resistance at $0.90 and reaching $0.905. However, the rally has been far from smooth. ARB experienced several pullbacks during this climb, with sellers briefly regaining control at various points. Volatility remains a challenge for ARB as it attempts to stabilize above $1. Polkadot (DOT) Price Gain: Can It Break the $10 Resistance? Polkadot (DOT) is edging closer to the $10 resistance level, driven by its advancements in cross-chain scalability. The integration of the Cardano chain has added to its appeal, helping DOT regain its spot among the top 15 cryptocurrencies. Its current price of just over $9 has sparked discussions about whether it can breach the $10 mark soon. Despite this progress, DOT faces significant hurdles. Heavy selling pressure at the $10 level may slow its upward momentum. Polkadot’s price has struggled to consistently gain ground, leaving some questioning its ability to sustain long-term growth. BlockDAG Presale Reaches $157.5M: A Major Step Toward Its $600M Goal! BlockDAG is emerging as the ultimate crypto to buy now for 2025, backed by its record-breaking presale success and unique blockchain technology. With its remarkable presale milestones, such as raising $5 million in one day and a staggering $20 million in just 48 hours, the presale funds have now crossed the $157.5 million mark. This unbelievable rise highlights its ambitious $600 million presale target seems well within reach in the upcoming months. Those who jumped early into the project have already seen their stakes grow by 2240%, with the BDAG coins price climbing from $0.001 to $0.0234 across 26 batches. This remarkable progress has caught the attention of top-tier exchanges, which are now actively discussing BDAG for potential listings. Once BDAG is listed on top-tier exchanges, holders will benefit from increased liquidity, making it easier to trade and access funds. Adding even more excitement, BlockDAG has unveiled a groundbreaking dashboard upgrade featuring a 5-tier bonus system. By using the BDAG250 code, buyers unlock a 150% bonus on their first purchase, with the bonus increasing to 170% on the second. Beyond these, the system keeps users engaged with “mystery bonuses” that unlock with further purchases, offering escalating rewards at every step. But here is the catch: this exclusive bonus offer ends on January 8, making this the perfect time to take advantage of these bonuses and secure a place in one of the most promising crypto projects for 2025. With the rising demand for BDAG coins and the current presale batch nearing a sellout, delaying could mean missing the opportunity to secure this crypto giant at its most affordable price. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Arbitrum (ARB) price rally pushes past $1, volatility continues to challenge its stability despite short-term gains. Similarly, Polkadot price gain has brought it near $10, but resistance at this level raises questions about sustained growth. Amid these developments, BlockDAG is making waves with its $600 million presale target. With $157.5 million raised in a few months and BDAG coins surging 2240%, it’s quickly becoming the best crypto to buy now . Moreover, its unique 5-tier bonus system, starting at 150% with the BDAG250 code, adds unmatched value for early buyers.

The trading and investment platform plans to go public in Q2, potentially seeking a valuation above the $3.5 billion it raised in a private funding round last year, although the timeline is subject to change. However, the details of the offering including timing could change and more banks may be added to the lineup, people familiar with the matter said. Founded in 2007, eToro offers a platform that lets users trade and follow top investors in assets including stocks and cryptocurrencies. It has more than 38 million registered users from 75 countries. eToro’s listing could be a response to increased enthusiasm for cryptoassets on its platform, following US President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of a crypto-friendly businessman to succeed the outgoing SEC chairman. Many believe this appointment could lead to more opportunities for cryptocurrencies, including the possibility of new crypto-related Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and other financial offerings. As a result, the price of Bitcoin has soared, even crossing the $100,000 mark for the first time. Notably, the company’s US arm, EToro USA LLC, agreed in September to pay $1.5 million and to restrict US users access to the cryptocurrencies on its platform, to settle allegations that it operated as an unregistered broker and clearing agency. The platform entered into a cease-and-desist order without admitting or denying the allegations. Last year, the firm completed a $250 million funding round that valued the company at $3.5 billion. Its investors include ION Group, SoftBank Vision Fund II and Velvet Sea Ventures. EToro previously attempted to go public through a merger at a $10.4 billion valuation with a special purpose acquisition company led by serial dealmaker Betsy Cohen.

37296625,https://crypto.news/?p=14316974,1733503672,Can Shiba Inu and Pepe prices rise to $1 in 2025?,"Shiba Inu and Pepe have become two of the largest meme coins in the crypto industry, boasting a combined market cap of nearly $30 billion. Pepe ( PEPE ) trading at $0.00002200, up by over 3,700% from its lowest level in 2023. Similarly, Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) has surged over 17,000% from its all-time low, elevating its valuation to more than $18 billion. Both coins are expected to continue performing well as the crypto bull run persists. The altcoin season index has climbed to 83, and the crypto fear and greed index has moved to 85. Their recent performance has sparked speculation about whether these meme coins could hit $1 by 2025. But how realistic is this prediction? Shiba Inu price needs to rise by 3.2 million percent to get to $1 SHIB price was trading at $0.000030 on Dec. 6, meaning it would need to increase by 3,225,805% to reach $1. While such growth is not impossible in the crypto world, it is highly unlikely to happen anytime soon. Still, technicals suggest that the Shiba Inu price has more upside in the coming months. The daily chart shows that the coin has found some resistance at the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. This price is also notable because it is at the weak, stop, & reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines. As such, this means that it has some more upside to get to the ultimate resistance point at $0.0000357. The bigger picture is that the coin has formed a cup and handle pattern. It has now moved to the upper side, which explains why it is consolidating. SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news Therefore, by measuring the depth of the cup, it means that Shiba Inu price will rise and cross the year-to-date high of $0.000045 and then hit $0.00005486.

The token is currently developing a bullish pennant pattern—a combination of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle—often associated with upward momentum. Pepe also completed a break and retest at the support level of $0.00001723, which aligns with the upper side of a cup and handle pattern. Additionally, the token formed a golden cross pattern in September, signaling potential bullish momentum.

ClostriX simplifies crypto trading with AI-driven tools, helping users identify profitable opportunities while managing risk effortlessly. Table of Contents Overview About ClostriX Benefits of using ClostriX Key features of ClostriX How Clostrix works Who is ClostriX for? Public review and verdict Conclusion ClostriX identifies crypto coins that are about to explode and alerts users to their ideal entry and exit points. It also protects users from their emotions by showing them the best and worst times to trade. Interested users can claim the special Clostrix early-adopter membership and secure a discounted price for life. Overview Service: ClostriX (Provided by Money and Mirth ) Sector: Crypto trading and analytics Business Model: Subscription-based service offering AI-driven trading tools Compatibility: Integrates with TradingView User support: Full support through ClostriX community on Discord About ClostriX ClostriX solves some of the most frustrating problems in the Crypto trading market: Thousands of different cryptos are available, making it impossible to track down all the winners The media distort reality, creating fear and greed that lead users to ruin Catching cryptos that are already pumping is extremely difficult and nerve-racking The program works on one principle: The markets are manipulated to move in cycles and timing is everything. With ClostriX loaded up on charts, users are able to: Identify coins that are about to make a move Avoid taking risky trades Get in on active trends easily When users toggle on the ClostriX indicator suite, the standard trading chart transforms into an actionable system of alerts and info points. Users can see from the image how simple the system makes trading: Expect aggressive moves up in the blue and golden areas Be very careful in the red and purple zones Follow the alerts to assist in getting the best entries and exits With platforms like ClostriX providing users with the right information and the right tools at the right time, trading becomes stress-free, simple and intuitive. Benefits of using ClostriX Many traders spend years losing while they learn the ropes and handle their emotions. ClostriX gives the user a reliable system based on predictable market behaviour, that way, they can skip expensive mistakes and focus on making money. Here are some of the top benefits of using ClostriX: Enter explosive moves with confidence: With ClostriX, users don’t have to guess which coins will pump anymore. The tool’s ‘interesting zone’ , ‘support/resistance retest’ , and ‘local bottom/top’ (or ‘buy the dip’ ) alerts guide traders to make smart entries, even on coins that are already on the move. Stop chasing trades when the odds are unfavorable: Most traders lose money because fear, greed, and FOMO take over, leaving them unsure when to start or stop. ClostriX puts an end to this chaos by guiding users to trade only when conditions are in their favor, helping them maximize profits during the best opportunities and safeguard their capital during tough market periods. Reap the full rewards from the best trends: It’s not unusual for traders to kick themselves because they closed their trade after a scary red candle, only for it to pump another 100%. ClostriX gives traders reliable trend support and trend break alerts so that they can stay on the trend and win big. Key features of ClostriX Clostrix integrates directly into TradingView without any hassle. With just a few clicks, charts will display: Long (long/buy/add) and short entries Alerts for trend break, trend support levels and other interesting zones Fully customizable notifications for the user’s favorite assets and timeframes With these, users can quickly create a trading strategy that is backed by data instead of gut feelings. Once traders have the ClostriX Indicator Suite running inside TradingView they can start to create alerts for their favorite assets and timeframes. They can filter the type of alerts they want within the indicator settings and even toggle them on/off during different time windows. That way, users can get on with their day and wait for ClostriX to let them know if it’s time to take action. ClostriX also includes a fully supportive community inside the ‘ Money and Mirth ’ Discord servers. Users can connect with other experienced traders who share insights and strategies. There’s a growing knowledge base available with education focussing on market cycles and market manipulation. How Clostrix works ClostriX does a smart job of picking out the best trading opportunities. On the higher timeframes (like daily candlesticks), traders can flip through hundreds of charts and find that the indicator suite reliably finds massive trades. But importantly, the program clearly marks out the bad trade areas to keep traders safe from losses. The system also works for non-crypto assets, as is shown in the Nvidia chart below. If users are trading the smaller time frames (scalping), they will need to add a bit more filtering to their strategy. Otherwise, they are more likely to get false alarms. This is because minute-based charts are wildly volatile. Who is ClostriX for? All of Clostrix’s features are adaptable to the users’ trading level. It doesn’t matter if they’re a beginner, swinger, or a pro. It helps: Beginners: Avoid common mistakes with a clear, easy-to-follow system Swing traders: Find perfect entries and hold confidently for big gains Experienced traders : Save time, add precision, and focus on the trades that matter Anyone can get an advantage by using ClostriX , because it’s focused on finding users great trading opportunities and protecting them from their emotions. It’s also a great tool for sanity-checking any trade ideas that traders come across on social media; take Dogecoin as one example in the image below. Public review and verdict Our experience with the product has revealed that the project upholds all of its promises. More importantly, the platform’s users in the community are thrilled with their trade results and how intuitive the system is. And it’s easy to understand their enthusiasm. At the time of writing this review, XLMUSDT recently exploded over 500% and ClostriX caught the entire move in a single 1-hour trend. Another user reported doubling his account in 30 days and shared the strategy to the community . Conclusion ClostriX is a reliable guide that gives traders the tools, insights, and community support needed to trade smarter. The platform works for all levels of experience and simplifies the trading process. For those who want to build a solid trading income in a dependable way, ClostriX offers a platform that regularly finds smart trading opportunities, helping traders gain huge wins. The platform is now, for a limited time, offering an early adopter program. This means that early adopters of ClostriX can access the full program — including the Indicator Suite, educational content, and community support — at a discounted price that they can keep ‘for life’.

37296410,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317777,1733502652,"Florida Could Launch Statewide Bitcoin Reserve by Q1 of 2025, Samuel Armes Says","Florida is preparing to potentially launch a statewide Bitcoin reserve in early 2025, according to Samuel Armes, President of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA), who shared the update earlier this week. Armes outlined his vision for the initiative, which includes leveraging both Florida’s pension fund and budget surplus to create a substantial cryptocurrency reserve. Samuel Armes Pushes for Florida Bitcoin Reserve in 2025 In a December 3 X post , Armes proposed that allocating just one percent of Florida’s $185.7 billion pension fund into Bitcoin could yield a $1.857 billion reserve. Florida is going to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and here’s how we’re going to do it Florida has a very good chance of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve this session, which starts in Q1 of 2025. Here’s what you need to know: The Speaker of the Florida House, Danny… pic.twitter.com/JJRNU1V7ZI — Samuel Armes (@samuelarmes) December 3, 2024 He clarified that Florida has already invested in cryptocurrency-related assets through its pension fund. “To be clear, Florida has already invested in Bitcoin and crypto-related assets through our pension fund,” said Armes. “The pension allocates its funds to hedge funds, and some of those hedge funds have bought various stocks in the Bitcoin space (miners, MSTR, Coinbase as examples) while also buying liquid tokens,” he added. Armes further suggested that Florida could allocate one percent of its $116.5 billion budget surplus—equivalent to $1.165 billion—toward Bitcoin investments. He expressed confidence in the state’s legislative landscape, stating, “My organization will advocate strongly for this, alongside three additional pro-Bitcoin bills in the upcoming legislative session.” Pro-Bitcoin Leadership and Market Momentum Florida currently possesses a number of key state leaders who are pro-Bitcoin and could help push a Bitcoin reserve bill into reality, including Speaker of the House Danny Perez and Senate President Bill Albritton. Governor Ron DeSantis has also been a staunch defender of Bitcoin, particularly against the prospect of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) . “Unaccountable institutions cannot impose a CBDC on Americans,” he said in an April 2023 X post. “They will tell us that CBDC won’t be abused but we are wise enough to know better.” Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a long-time advocate for a national Bitcoin reserve, appeared to endorse Florida’s potential initiative. States are the incubators of great ideas. It’s a race to the top and welcome the friendly competition. https://t.co/7eqN9JlQq8 — Cynthia Lummis (@CynthiaMLummis) December 4, 2024 “States are the incubators of great ideas,” Lummis said in a December 4 X post . “It’s a race to the top, and we welcome the friendly competition.” Bitcoin’s recent market performance has added momentum to the conversation. The cryptocurrency surpassed the $100,000 mark this week , buoyed by growing mainstream adoption and the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. President-elect Donald Trump has also contributed to Bitcoin’s rising prominence, having pledged to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile over the summer. However, states like Florida may move ahead first, setting the stage for decentralized adoption at the state level. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, Florida’s efforts to establish a cryptocurrency reserve could serve as a blueprint for other states considering similar initiatives. Whether through pension funds, budget surpluses, or legislative support, the Sunshine State is positioning itself as a key player in the growing Bitcoin economy.

37296306,https://thecoinrise.com/tether-in-spotlight-as-celsius-founder-admits-to-fraud/,1733502564,Tether In Spotlight as Celsius Founder Admits to Fraud,"Tether, the largest stablecoin in the world, may face increased scrutiny after a major claim made by Alex Mashinsky, the former founder of Celsius Network. Mashinsky, who recently admitted to fraud charges, said that his crypto lending platform was a fraudulent business. His cooperation with U.S. prosecutors could put Tether’s operations under scrutiny. Alex Mashinsky Sentence to Come Soon The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced that Mashinsky pleaded guilty to one count of committing commodities and securities fraud. Mashinsky’s guilty plea marks a turning point in the case, as he acknowledges his role in misleading investors and mishandling funds. Alex agreed to forfeit $48 million in ill-gotten funds as part of his plea. Meanwhile, according to reports, Mashinsky will be sentenced on April 8, 2025. He could face up to 30 years in prison, depending on how the district judge views Mashinsky’s honesty about his regrets. The ex-CEO has agreed to share what he knows about Tether’s operations, hoping to get a lighter sentence. While Mashinsky still faces legal challenges, his willingness to help prosecutors could change how people view Tether and its role in the crypto market. As the investigation continues, the industry prepares for possible new information that could reshape its regulations. Celsius Network Says Tether Acted Unreasonably Recall that the once-renowned digital asset platform initiated a lawsuit against Tether and its affiliated entities . Celsius had a loan agreement with Tether in 2020. In 2021, Tether lent Celsius about $1 billion at an interest rate between 5% and 6%, with Bitcoin as collateral. According to the complaint, Celsius asserted that Tether acted in bad faith by hastily liquidating some amount of BTC, violating the terms of their agreement. Celsius also sought compensation for the contract breach. It requested the court to direct Tether to return the value of the BTC or an equivalent amount as compensation. However, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino called the lawsuit a “baseless shakedown.” Paolo defended Tether’s actions and the integrity of its contractual obligations. Celsius Network Files for Bankruptcy Protection Celsius filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in July 2022. Amidst its bankruptcy proceedings, the firm sought favorable settlements for its creditors. This led to a proposal to resolve claims from customers who alleged fraud by increasing recoveries by 5%. However, in February, the bankrupt crypto lending platform officially exited bankruptcy and returned over $3 billion in crypto and fiat to its users affected by the firm’s sudden halt. As reported by TheCoinRise, Celsius’s exit from bankruptcy saw the creation of a new Bitcoin mining company managed by crypto mining firm Hut 8. The platform added that the new firm would continue delivering recoveries to creditors. Meanwhile, Alex resigned as the platform’s CEO in 2022. Alex was accused of making trade calls leading to the firm’s bankruptcy.

Satoshi Nakamoto Dropped to Second Place!,"The recent rise in Bitcoin has also had a positive impact on spot Bitcoin ETFs, and inflows to ETFs have increased in recent days. With the inflows this week, the total number of Bitcoin held in US spot Bitcoin ETFs has surpassed the BTC held by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated in a post on his X account that US spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed Satoshi Nakamoto's assets in less than a year. Balchunas said that US spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed 1.1 million BTC, marking a significant milestone for the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. Balchunas added that this significant success in Bitcoin ETFs has been achieved in less than 12 months and that this is just the beginning. “US spot ETFs have surpassed Satoshi in total Bitcoin holdings, they currently hold over 1.1 million BTC, more than anyone else in the world, and they are not even a year old, they are literally still babies and toddlers.” Balchunas also announced the institutional platforms that hold the most Bitcoin, and in his list, US spot Bitcoin ETFs came first, Satoshi Nakamoto came second, and Binance came third. Stating that spot Bitcoin ETFs currently hold 1.104 million BTC, the analyst said that Satoshi Nakamoto holds 1.1 million BTC, and Binance ranks third with 633,103 BTC. KING OF THE HILL: The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1m, more than anyone in the world, and they're not even a year old yet, literally babies still.

President-elect Trump wasted no time claiming credit for the surge, celebrating the milestone as proof of his pro-crypto policies. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is gaining investor confidence as it eyes $6,000. At the same time, a new Ethereum-based token, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), is capturing attention, with analysts predicting it could follow Bitcoin's parabolic trajectory in the coming years. Bitcoin Breaks $100K Barrier, Trump Takes All the Credit After weeks of intentionally building up its price, Bitcoin finally swept past six figures on late Wednesday. Bitcoin price was more than $103,000 on Thursday morning. This historical crossing of the Rubicon was a thunderclap through the market, with traders and analysts still excitedly discussing the long-term implications. And Trump, never one to duck the limelight, congratulated ""Bitcoiners"" on Truth Social. ""CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!"" he wrote on the site. Analysts say Trump's pro-crypto stance is the main reason for Bitcoin price surge. They believe his cabinet appointments and regulatory relaxation have given institutional investors hope in the long run. The milestone underscores Bitcoin's gradual transformation into an accepted mainstream asset and its function as a store of value. Ethereum Starts Moving While Bitcoin is in the news, Ethereum is quietly building its argument for long-term growth. Currently trading at $3,719, ETH has risen 51% in the last month. With Microsoft founder Bill Gates joining the pressure on Bitcoin, the developers are rather bullish for Ethereum. Most of them say it may hit $6,000 by mid-2025. Ethereum's move to Ethereum 2.0 has cut energy use while increasing staking incentives, winning over more investors. As it is an essential component of the decentralized finance (DeFi) network and also what underpins non-fungible tokens (NFTs), many developers and institutions prefer Ethereum. Its use and acceptance also make it a prime contender for continued growth. Yeti Ouro: The Next Parabolic Success? While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the market, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is emerging as a potential breakout star. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this new ERC-20 token offers a unique mix of meme appeal and real-world utility. At the heart of the Yeti Ouro ecosystem is Yeti Go, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game. Players use YETIO tokens to compete in races, customize vehicles, and earn rewards. The game’s high-quality graphics and engaging gameplay make it a standout in the P2E market. Yeti Ouro’s deflationary tokenomics set it apart. With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens and a burn mechanism reducing circulation, YETIO creates scarcity that could drive long-term value. The presale has already sold out 80%, raising close to $1 million. Investors are flocking to the project, drawn by its innovative ecosystem and strong growth potential.

37295922,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390305,1733502294,dYdX Hits $2.5 Amid Rising Demand from Whales: Is $3.2 the Next Resistance?,"The post dYdX Hits $2.5 Amid Rising Demand from Whales: Is $3.2 the Next Resistance? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, Bitcoin’s price experienced a significant drop from its $100K level, while the altcoin market remained strong. Among the standout performers, the price of dYdX soared over 35%, reaching the $2.5 resistance mark. Triggered by increasing demand and positive news, analysts are bullish that the dYdX price may soon surpass the $3.2 resistance level. dYdX Surges Following Trump’s Decision dYdX’s value increased by 35% in the last 24 hours, reaching a seven-month peak of $2.48 on December 6, which pushed its market capitalization to more than $1.6 billion. Data from Coinglass shows that dYdX price witnessed a total liquidation of around $3.9 million, and buyers liquidated around $2.2 million worth of positions. DYDX’s recent surge was largely triggered by news that President-elect Donald Trump has appointed David O. Sacks as the White House Director of Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency. The increasing interest comes from Sacks’ role in Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm that has heavily invested in DYDX. The link between the newly appointed cryptocurrency authority and the token sparked strong bullish sentiment among investors, driving DYDX’s latest gains. Another factor likely driving the altcoin’s rally is the increasing interest from whale investors. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that DYDX whale holder net flows changed from a net outflow of $766K worth of DYDX tokens on December 2 to a net inflow exceeding $2.2 billion worth of DYDX tokens by Wednesday, December 4. When whales start to accumulate an altcoin, it often triggers fear of missing out (FOMO) among retail investors, who rush to buy the altcoin in hopes of securing profits. Additionally, data from DeFiLlama indicates that the total value locked in the DeFi protocol has risen from approximately $226 million in November to over $388 million currently. However, as the price faced resistance around $2.5, the large transaction volume dropped from the peak of $15.7 million to the recent low of $3.2 million. This shows the continuous withdrawal from whales amid rising volatility in the price chart. What’s Next for dYdX Price? dYdX price broke above its immediate resistance channels, resulting in a push toward $2.5. However, buyers failed to hold the momentum around that level, plunging the price toward 23.6% Fib level. As of writing, dYdX price trades at $2.3, surging over 21% in the last 24 hours. The upward trend in moving averages and the RSI approaching the overbought territory indicate that the path of least resistance is upward. The DYDX/USDT pair could climb to $2.5 and potentially reach $3.2, where significant selling pressure is anticipated. This bullish scenario could be invalidated in the short term if the price declines and falls below the 20-day EMA at $1.9. Such a drop would suggest a lack of buyer interest at higher prices, possibly leading the pair to drop to the 50-day SMA at $1.3.",POSITIVE,DYDX,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | DYDX,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/dydx-hits-2-5-amid-rising-demand-from-whales-is-3-2-the-next-resistance/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

However, he emphasized its volatility, slow transaction speeds, and limited real-world utility as significant drawbacks. “Bitcoin hardly qualifies as money,” Dudley wrote, noting that its lack of widespread acceptance as payment and susceptibility to loss make it an impractical choice for a national reserve. The op-ed also outlined financial concerns. Establishing a Bitcoin reserve would require substantial government borrowing or increased money printing by the Federal Reserve, Dudley argued, potentially driving inflation and raising debt-servicing costs. He warned that the reserve could primarily inflate Bitcoin prices, benefiting existing holders while offering little value to the broader public. You might also like: Bitcoin price can hit $200k in 2025, but crossing $122k will be crucial Bitcoin’s unsustainable price surge Dudley highlighted an existing congressional proposal that would mandate government purchases of one million Bitcoin over five years. He described the plan as an unsustainable price-boosting scheme with no clear exit strategy, leaving the government holding volatile assets that generate no income. Rather than pursuing such policies, Dudley urged the Trump administration to focus on developing comprehensive regulations for the crypto industry. He suggested measures like ensuring stablecoins are fully backed by federal assets, defining the legal status of digital tokens, and setting rules to protect consumers while curbing illicit activities. “Crypto technology has the potential to improve the financial system,” Dudley concluded, but without “strong guardrails, fraud and abuse will persist.” You might also like: US voters gave a ‘pro-crypto’ mandate—what happens now? | Opinion",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/hardly-money-former-ny-fed-chief-blasts-trumps-bitcoin-reserve/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37295892.jpeg

37295723,https://finbold.com/?p=217378,1733501845,AI predicts SUI price for year-end,"Sui Network ( SUI ), a high-performance layer-1 blockchain, recently achieved a new all-time high (ATH) of $4.47, marking an impressive 80% gain over the past month. However, the token has since seen a slight pullback to $4.15, registering a 1.61% dip in daily trading. Adding to the optimism surrounding the token, SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has reached a record $1.63 billion, showing growing investor confidence. Despite its remarkable ascent, questions remain about the factors driving this surge and whether the momentum will sustain through the year. Catalysts driving SUI’s momentum Sui’s price surge is likely tied to a mix of factors rather than a single trigger. The announcement of Phantom Wallet integration with the Sui Network has undoubtedly boosted its appeal, enhancing usability with staking, token swaps, and NFT storage capabilities. However, this development might not entirely account for the recent gains, suggesting broader market dynamics and increased utility are at play. Derivatives data paints a bullish picture Derivatives data from Coinglass points to a bullish outlook for SUI as trading volume surged by 11.20% to $4.55 billion, signaling heightened market activity and growing interest in the token. While Open Interest (OI) dipped by 4.22% to $969.34 million, potentially reflecting short-sellers closing their positions, the dominance of long positions remains evident. SUI derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass On Binance , the SUI/USDT long/short ratio stands at 2.97, while OKX reports a similarly bullish 2.6, indicating strong trader confidence in further price increases. Further supporting this bullish sentiment, the OI-weighted funding rate remains consistently positive, indicating traders are willing to pay a premium to hold long positions, a hallmark of a bullish trend. Over the past 24 hours, long liquidations totaled $5.99 million, far outpacing short liquidations at $2.79 million, highlighting strong buying pressure even during price corrections. With these metrics pointing toward sustained confidence and upward momentum, SUI appears well-positioned to continue its rally in the near term. Moreover, Sui’s TVL has shown remarkable consistency, staying above $1 billion since November 6 and currently sitting at an impressive $1.66 billion, according to DefiLlama . This sustained level of capital inflows highlights the network’s robust ecosystem activity and steady user engagement, further reinforcing its bullish outlook. Technical analysis: Key levels to watch From a technical perspective, SUI continues to break through significant resistance levels, posting a daily gain of 15.02%. According to data from Rose Premium Signal , key upside targets are positioned at $5.47, $6.44, and $7.31, with these levels representing potential profit-taking zones. The $2.96 support level remains critical for maintaining the bullish outlook, serving as a possible re-entry point if a retracement occurs. A breach below this level would invalidate the upward bias, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a tight stop-loss slightly below this support. With robust technical indicators suggesting continued strength, SUI appears well-positioned to extend its rally toward $7.3, provided buying volume remains consistent. AI predicts SUI’s year-end price Finbold consulted ChatGPT-4o to analyze SUI’s prospects as the token reached new highs. The AI model projects SUI’s year-end price to range between $5.50 and $6.50, driven by robust ecosystem growth, record-high TVL figures, and strong trader sentiment. ChatGPT outlook on SUI. Source: ChatGPT /Finbold In a bullish scenario, SUI could surpass $6, reflecting sustained demand and network activity. However, under moderate market conditions, the price may consolidate around $5.00. In a bearish case, the token could retreat to the $3.50–$4.00 range. As SUI approaches the year-end, investors are encouraged to monitor broader market sentiment and ecosystem developments, which will play a pivotal role in shaping its price trajectory.

JasmyCoin ( JASMY ), popularly known as Japan’s Bitcoin ( BTC ), was trading at $0.052, up by 1,000% from its lowest level this year. The coin’s rally was largely attributed to Bitcoin’s surge, which hit a record high of $104,000 on Thursday. Other Bitcoin-related cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ravencoin also experienced significant gains.

The platform, created by former Sony executives, aims to enhance data privacy by integrating blockchain technology with IoT. Jasmy price analysis JasmyCoin chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Jasmy has performed strongly this year, driven by rising demand for cryptocurrencies. It has formed a golden cross, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossing each other. The coin has also completed a cup and handle pattern, a common continuation signal. A C&H pattern forms when an asset rises to an initial peak, creates a rounded bottom, and then retests the peak. Jasmy has now moved above the upper side of the cup, signaling potential further gains. The profit target is calculated by measuring the depth of the cup and projecting that distance above the upper side of the cup. This suggests the coin could rise to $0.075, approximately 50% above its current level. This target aligns with the ultimate resistance of the Murrey Math Lines. The bullish outlook will be invalidated if Jasmy price falls below the strong pivot and reverse level of $0.03662.

Spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds in the U.S. have become the largest holder of the cryptocurrency globally, with more than $109 billion invested by Wall Street. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, holds 1.1 million tokens worth $108 billion at current prices, with those holdings remaining dormant for years. Outpacing Satoshi’s stack is a big deal for U.S. spot BTC ETFs, an asset class that started trading on Wall Street in mid-January 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT topped the group, managing nearly half of spot Bitcoin ETF volume. Investors have allocated over $51 billion to Bitcoin through the $10 trillion asset management giant. Grayscale and Fidelity round out the top three, holding $21 billion and $19 billion, respectively.

The second-largest cryptocurrency is up 2.4% in the last 24 hours and 8.4% in the last seven days, outperforming bitcoin (BTC) in both timeframes. The move comes as spot ether exchange-traded funds saw record inflows on Thursday.  As of writing, ether is trading for $4,033, just 2% away from setting a fresh 2024 high. It's also a mere 20% away from its all-time high of $4,868. The ETH/BTC ratio, which has been getting hammered since September 2022, has reached 0.04 again — a level that marked a brief top for ether in relation to bitcoin on Nov. 10.  The Coinbase premium on ether also continues to expand — meaning that ether is trading for a higher price on the exchange than on the most liquid crypto exchange, Binance. Coinbase premiums are generally seen as a sign of demand among U.S. institutional investors as well as retail participants. TradingView data shows a slight increase in ether's price on Coinbase relative to Binance, suggesting the market is driven by activity from the U.S,., which coincided with the U.S. market opening around an hour ago.  That's not all.

These communications, brought to light by Coinbase , highlight how regulatory ambiguity has fueled tension between crypto firms and federal banking authorities. The documents , obtained through a legal challenge by Coinbase and released on Friday, include letters instructing banks to pause all activities related to cryptocurrencies. “We respectfully ask that you pause all crypto asset-related activity,” the documents read. These FDIC directives reportedly delayed or halted banks’ plans to offer crypto services until they could address unclear compliance requirements. CoinDesk was the first to report this news.

Thank you to the Coinbase legal team for doggedly pursuing these documents. https://t.co/VtLs9Uhbuj — Miller (@millercwl) December 6, 2024 Coinbase claims these communications reveal a coordinated effort to restrict banking access for legitimate crypto businesses, a practice some in the industry refer to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” You might also like: Bitcoin price can hit $200k in 2025, but crossing $122k will be crucial Crypto’s fractured relationship with banking For years, crypto companies have struggled to maintain reliable banking partnerships in the U.S., citing vague or overly cautious guidance from federal regulators. Banks are hesitant to engage with crypto firms due to concerns about regulatory compliance, fraud risks, and potential reputational harm. Without clear rules, many banks avoid the sector altogether, creating a significant hurdle for crypto businesses that rely on traditional banking to operate. The FDIC’s letters appear to underscore this dynamic. The communications show that the agency required banks to answer complex questions about their proposed crypto activities. These inquiries often delayed approvals or led banks to abandon their plans. Coinbase executives argue that the lack of formal crypto guidelines allows regulators to impose informal restrictions, effectively isolating the crypto industry from mainstream financial services. The letters “show Operation Chokepoint 2.0 wasn’t just some crypto conspiracy theory. [The FDIC] is still hiding behind way overbroad redactions,” wrote Coinbase’s CLO Paul Grewal on X. Operation Chokepoint 2.0, as alleged by crypto proponents, describes regulatory efforts to limit the crypto industry’s access to banking services. Critics argue this approach stifles legal crypto businesses by effectively cutting them off from traditional financial infrastructure. “Law abiding American businesses should be able to access banking services without government interference.

Ethereum (ETH) ETH has been on the move lately. In the past week, its price climbed by 6.94%, showing a steady upward trend. Over the past month, the growth is even more remarkable with a surge of 63.20%. However, when looking at the six-month period, the increase is a modest 6.40%, indicating some volatility earlier in the year. Currently trading between $3392 and $3890, Ethereum is nearing its nearest resistance level at $4069. Breaking through this point could see it aim for the next resistance at $4568. On the flip side, the nearest support level sits at $3074, with a secondary support at $2576. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $3918.89, slightly above the current price range, while the 100-day SMA is $3714.33. Technical indicators suggest a potential for continued growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 60.50, and the Stochastic is at 67.44, both implying that the asset is not overbought yet. The MACD level of 37.74 indicates bullish momentum. Based on these factors, Ethereum might continue its upward trajectory, possibly reaching new resistance levels and offering opportunities for further gains. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen significant movement recently. Over the past week, its price increased by 22.17%. In the past month, it surged by 86.48%. However, over six months, the price change is 32.80%. The current price range is between $0.00002509 and $0.00003493. The Relative Strength Index is at 52.62, which is close to neutral territory. The Stochastic indicator stands at 23.53, suggesting the coin might be oversold. The MACD level is positive at 0.0000002951, hinting at bullish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.00003166, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $0.00003011, indicating a short-term upward trend. If SHIB continues its upward trend, it may test the nearest resistance level at $0.00003897. Breaking this could lead to the second resistance at $0.00004881, which would be an increase of about 40% from the current upper price range. On the downside, if the price falls, it might find support at $0.00001929. Dropping to the second support at $0.000009456 would represent a significant decrease. Arbitrum (ARB) Arbitrum (ARB) has experienced a notable price increase recently. Over the past week, its price jumped by 19.51%, and over the past month, it surged by an impressive 144.49%. In the last six months, the price change is 15.78%, showing significant growth after a period of stability. Currently trading between $0.86 and $1.04, ARB is approaching its nearest resistance level at $1.10. The simple moving averages for 10 days and 100 days are $1.15 and $1.05, respectively, indicating that the current price is slightly below these averages. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 58.32, suggesting the asset is nearing overbought territory but hasn’t reached it yet. The Stochastic oscillator is high at 90.89, which may indicate that the asset is overbought and could face a price correction. The MACD level is positive at 0.0109, hinting at bullish momentum. If the upward trend continues, ARB could break through the $1.10 resistance level and potentially reach the second resistance at $1.28. This would represent an increase of approximately 23% from the current upper price range. On the downside, if the price reverses, it may find support at $0.76 or even $0.59, which would be decreases of about 27% and 43%, respectively. Traders are watching these key levels closely to gauge ARB’s next move. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) has been on an interesting journey lately. Over the past week, its price has increased by 5.78%, showing modest growth in the short term. Looking at the monthly picture, KAS has surged by an impressive 56.58%, indicating strong upward momentum. However, when extending the timeline to six months, the price change is relatively flat, with a slight decrease of 0.47%. This suggests that recent gains may be recovering from previous declines. The current price range for KAS is between $0.15 and $0.18, aligning closely with both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.16. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 57.82, which is in the neutral zone but leaning towards bullishness. The Stochastic indicator is at a high 86.63, suggesting that the asset might be nearing overbought conditions. The MACD level of 0.0004472973 indicates subtle bullish momentum. Considering these technical indicators, KAS may continue its upward trend in the near term. The nearest resistance level is at $0.19; breaking through this could pave the way toward the second resistance at $0.22, representing a potential increase of around 22%. On the other hand, if the price faces downward pressure, the nearest support level is at $0.13, with a drop to the second support at $0.10 equating to a decrease of about 33%. Traders will be watching these levels closely as they could signal significant price movements. Conclusion While ETH, SHIB, ARB, and KAS offer potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) targeting 20,000% growth, could turn a $500 investment into significant wealth by 2026.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has long been touted by its die-hard supporters as the crypto destined to hit $100,000 — and eventually even $1 million. Now, with Bitcoin finally surpassing the $100,000 mark, the question remains: Is this the beginning of something bigger, or are we nearing a point where the market could hit a rough patch? Table of Contents Accumulation zones and liquidity gaps Voices of caution Broader market risks Accumulation zones and liquidity gaps Data revealed by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode highlights key levels shaping Bitcoin’s current market dynamics, based on their new Cost Basis Distribution metric, which helps track where BTC has been bought and sold by showing where investors have concentrated their purchases. According to their findings , the $39,000-$40,000 range has become “the largest accumulation zone” in 2023, with 322,000 BTC bought at these levels. This shows that investors have had confidence at that level, and it might act as a key support should Bitcoin’s price drop. https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1865006153719042115 Over the past three months, the $62,000–$64,000 range has become a key area where investors have built up their positions. The period helped set the stage for Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000, and now, these levels are seen as “strong demand zones,” likely to draw in buyers if Bitcoin’s price falls back to them, the analysts say. “This period marked consolidation and investor positioning for the rally. These levels now serve as strong demand zones that were critical in kickstarting the next leg of the bull run.” Glassnode More recently, over 101,000 BTC have been accumulated between $96,000 and $98,000, making this range a strong support zone in the short term. Above $98,000, about 81,000 BTC were bought, creating resistance, the analysts add. However, Glassnode points out that below $96,000, there’s weak support because not much trading has happened there, opening space for more volatility if prices drop toward the liquidity gap below $88,000.

His caution comes as Bitcoin pulls back from its recent high of $103,000, sitting at around $98,000 as of press time.

For instance, Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett also flagged potential overheating in financial markets, pointing to the S&P 500’s remarkable 27% gain this year, what appears to be its best performance since 2019. With the index nearing its dot-com-era peak valuation, Hartnett predicts an “overshoot” for Bitcoin and stocks in early 2025. Bitcoin, now with a market capitalization of around $2 trillion, ranks as the world’s 11th-largest economy. And while institutional interest has bolstered its rise, concerns about market leverage still loom. Earlier on, Galaxy Digital ‘s Mike Novogratz shared similar concerns, warning that the current high leverage in the crypto market will eventually lead to “one, if not two, vicious retracements, which will test your soul.” Navigating the path ahead What is clear now is that the $96,000–$98,000 range acts as the first line of defence, with the $62,000–$64,000 accumulation zone coming next. However, if Bitcoin drops below $88,000, the liquidity might — in theory — cause a faster decline, possibly pushing the price back to the $39,000–$40,000 range, which is seen as a historical demand zone. The market’s future is anyone’s guess, but it’s clear that factors like economic trends, investor sentiment, and the political landscape will play a big role, especially under the Trump administration .

XRP Set to Soar Again appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the native token of Ripple, is poised to continue its upward momentum as its hourly chart flashes a bullish signal. This bullishness in the chart appears after three days of price consolidation. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has broken out of a descending triangle price action pattern on the hourly time frame and is now poised to soar again. The recent price correction appears to be beneficial for XRP’s upcoming rally. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if XRP continues its upward momentum and closes a daily candle above $2.48, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 17% to reach the $2.90 level or even higher if the trend remains unchanged. Currently, the altcoin is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on both hourly and daily time frames, indicating an uptrend. Meanwhile, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near the oversold area, suggesting potential upward momentum in the coming days. $386 Million XRP Outflow From Exchanges In addition to the bullish technical analysis, whales and institutions have shown strong interest in the altcoin, as reported by on-chain analytics firm Coinglass’s XRP spot inflow/outflow metrics. Data reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $386.04 million over the past four trading days. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency context, “outflow” refers to the transfer of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses. These metrics suggest that whales and institutions are accumulating tokens for the long term. Furthermore, outflows indicate potential buying opportunities, reduce the likelihood of selling pressure, and signal possible upward momentum. With bullish on-chain metrics and positive technical analysis, it appears that the bulls are currently dominating the asset and could support XRP in its upcoming rally. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.35 and has experienced a price drop of 0.35% in the past 24 hours.

37294997,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373673,1733500481,Solana ETF Filings Face Obstacles as SEC Rejection Looms,"Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have played a crucial role in driving widespread adoption by providing a simple way for investors to gain exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies without the complexities of managing a crypto wallet. However, new reports suggest that Solana may not follow this path to accessibility due to regulatory obstacles. Solana ETFs Set to Be Rejected? Spot Solana ETFs are set to face disappointment, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notifying at least two of the five prospective issuers about the rejection of their 19b-4 filings. FOX Business’s Eleanor Terrett confirmed that sources suggest the securities regulator is not inclined to approve any new cryptocurrency ETFs under the current administration. This approach aligns with the SEC’s handling of Bitcoin ETFs, where approvals were coordinated across multiple issuers, avoiding selective approval. Earlier this year, in January, the SEC approved eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, followed by a series of spot Ethereum ETFs in July. As such, a Solana ETF would further diversify the selection of crypto spot ETFs accessible to investors. So far, multiple asset managers have sought to secure approval for Solana-based investment products, the most recent being Grayscale. According to a filing on Tuesday, the crypto asset manager is looking to convert its $120 million Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) into a spot ETF on NYSE Arca, With this, Grayscale became the fifth asset manager to apply for a spot in Solana ETF this year. Other large asset managers, such as VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, have similarly applied , reflecting significant industry enthusiasm amid a market-wide resurgence, with SOL alone rising by over 200% this year. However, concerns regarding SOL’s classification persist. The SEC rejected Cboe BZX’s proposals for two spot Solana ETFs in August this year, citing doubts over whether SOL qualifies as a security. Atkins’ SEC Appointment Sparks Hope The recent appointment of pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC chair, however, has sparked renewed optimism for a more favorable regulatory environment for digital asset products, including Solana ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, echoed this sentiment in a tweet , stating that the SEC will not approve any ETF filings until Atkins officially takes charge as SEC Chair in January. As the current administration winds down, industry veterans anticipate that regulatory changes, including potential approvals for crypto ETFs, will only accelerate once new leadership takes the helm.

37294970,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390297,1733500424,"Former NY Fed President Argues Bitcoin Could Undermine USD, Suggests Prioritizing Regulatory Framework","The post Former NY Fed President Argues Bitcoin Could Undermine USD, Suggests Prioritizing Regulatory Framework appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has recently surged past $100,000 following Donald Trump‘s election victory. Amidst broader market sentiments, the crypto community eagerly anticipates that Trump administration will prove to be pro-crypto and will stand behind his promise of a strategic BTC reserve for the United States. Advocates believe it could serve as a hedge against inflation and a diversification tool in portfolios. However, Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has criticized Bitcoin’s role as money, describing its volatility and lack of income generation as its shortcomings. As per a latest Bloomberg report, Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has expressed concerns over the idea of incorporating Bitcoin into the U.S. national reserves and argues that it would not benefit most Americans. He emphasized that such a move might not align with the nation’s best interests and could divert focus from more inclusive economic policies. Can Bitcoin Undermine USD’s Status? He noted that incorporating Bitcoin into the US national reserves could undermine the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency and primarily benefit specific interest groups rather than the broader American public. Notably, Bill Dudley stated that Bitcoin is a weak asset, noting reasons such as price volatility, lack of widespread acceptance as payment, and slow and expensive transaction processes that make BTC a weak asset. He also noted the risk of individuals losing access to their Bitcoin holdings and that, unlike traditional financial assets, Bitcoin does not generate income through interest or dividends. “Bitcoin is not connected to any cash flows like interest or dividends, and its price is driven purely by speculative demand,” he explained. The former Fed chair also noted that the absence of an exit strategy for a Bitcoin reserve would make it a liability. “The government would end up holding tokens that produce no income, offering no real value to the majority of Americans,” he said. Suggests To Focus On Comprehensive Regulations- Notably, Dudley argued that creating a Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. would require the Treasury to increase borrowing, raising debt servicing costs or requiring the Fed to print more money, ultimately fueling inflation. Instead of focusing on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, Dudley has called for the Trump administration to prioritize creating a robust regulatory framework for the crypto industry. He stressed the need for clear rules to protect consumers, regulate stablecoins, and prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities. “Crypto technology has the potential to improve the financial system,” Dudley noted. “However, without strong guardrails, fraud and abuse will continue to undermine trust and hinder progress.” Market Optimism Prevails Nevertheless, there is market optimism amidst expectations of a more crypto-friendly administration. Also, the nomination of digital asset-friendly Paul Atkins to chair the SEC provided the final boost as bitcoin surpassed $100,000 to record highs.

A new contender, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is ready for a similar rally. This AI altcoin focuses on revolutionizing the real estate market. It could deliver similar life-changing returns by Q1 2025. PropiChain is still in its presale stage, but it offers massive growth potential at its lowest price yet. This makes it a good opportunity for early investors looking for a potential winner. Combining artificial intelligence and blockchain, the AI altcoin aims to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. Its price is set to explode thanks to strong fundamentals and investor interest. Analysts predict PropiChain could outperform many cryptos in the coming months. Its specialized focus and innovative technology give it a clear edge. Analyst: Dogecoin to Reach $1 An analyst has claimed that Dogecoin could surge to $1 as it has the momentum to do so. In the past 30 days, Dogecoin has risen 161%, bringing its market cap to $62.6 billion. In the past year alone, It rose 408%, making it one of the best investments in that period. Now, it is projected to soar higher. However, despite its promising prospects, the analyst warned about potential short-term price drops. At $0.4239, Dogecoin would need to surge 136% to reach $1. The analyst also pointed out that Dogecoin faces selling pressure as traders may want to book profits. PCHAIN: AI Altcoin to Grow $500 Into $55K PropiChain is tipped to surge 800% during the presale alone. Its price can jump from $0.004 in round 1 to 200% higher in round 2. Analysts predict that by 2025, this AI altcoin could turn a $500 investment into an incredible $55,000. As an AI altcoin, PropiChain is counting on artificial intelligence to take real estate management and investment to the next level. PropiChain uses AI to provide users with predictive market analysis . This offers investors data-driven insights to help them make smarter decisions. This feature reduces risks and increases profit potential. Its AI technology also simplifies property searches with advanced filtering and personalized suggestions. Users can find real estate opportunities tailored to their needs, saving time and maximizing value. In addition, PropiChain employs automated valuation models powered by AI, delivering unbiased and accurate appraisals. This benefits buyers and sellers by providing transparent property pricing. This reduces delays caused by negotiations. The platform goes further with 24/7 AI chatbots and virtual assistants. These tools provide real-time support, answering queries and guiding users through complex processes. Investors' problems are quickly addressed. PropiChain also uses AI-powered smart contracts to automate real estate transactions like lease renewals and property sales. This eliminates delays and reduces costs. Its successful smart contract audit with BlockAudit has added a layer of credibility. Dogecoin vs PCHAIN: The Best Crypto Investment? Dogecoin has previously transformed small investments into fortunes with its substantial gains. However, its days of meteoric growth are likely behind it. Dogecoin is now handing the reigns to a new AI altcoin in town. Unlike Dogecoin, PropiChain is at its lowest-ever price. This gives it a competitive edge as its price can rise during the presale and after the public launch. PCHAIN is already attracting Dogecoin whales, indicating confidence in the AI altcoin. Conclusion PropiChain is one of the most promising altcoins for 2024. It offers a unique value proposition. It is currently in the first round of its presale, with each PCHAIN token going for its lowest-ever price of $0.004. PropiChain’s smart contract has been independently audited by BlockAudit . The AI altcoin has been listed on CoinMarketCap . This milestone achievement points to a project that takes its users and investors seriously. Don't wait any longer. Join PropiChain's token presale and create generational wealth, with a $500 investment potentially yielding $55,000 in Q1 2025.

37294890,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623872,1733499785,"Ethereum continues long-awaited comeback with a surge past $4,000","Ethereum just smashed through the $4,000 barrier, a level it hadn’t touched since March. This milestone is being driven by record-breaking inflows into U.S.-listed Ethereum spot ETFs. On December 5, these ETFs saw an eye-popping $428 million in net inflows, the highest one-day figure ever recorded, according to data from SoSoValue . This surge comes in the shadow of Bitcoin breaking past $100,000. Ethereum is quietly building its own rally, with investors betting it could soon topple its 2021 all-time high. Since November 5, when Donald Trump won the presidential election, Ethereum’s price has climbed 61%, outperforming Bitcoin. Trump’s win also reignited hopes for regulatory changes, especially with his appointment of the pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Inflows and futures frenzy Ethereum’s rally is being powered by institutional interest. U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs are seeing unprecedented activity. The $428 million that poured into these funds in one day highlights the growing appetite for Ethereum among big-money players. This demand is particularly interesting because Ethereum ETFs, unlike staking directly in the network, don’t generate staking rewards for holders. Despite this limitation, the inflows show strong investor confidence. The futures market tells the same story. Open interest in Ethereum futures contracts on the CME Group exchange has hit record highs. Ethereum’s network data is equally bullish. Its Realized Cap—a metric that calculates the value of coins based on their last transaction price—has hit a record high of $243.45 billion. This indicator had been in decline from August to November, but the recent spike signals renewed confidence. Historically, increases in the Realized Cap have preceded major price surges. Glassnode data shows that the rise in Ethereum’s Realized Cap reflects a repricing of ETH as coins last moved at lower prices. This suggests holders are becoming more confident, pushing Ethereum’s value higher. For traders betting against Ethereum, this could be a dangerous sign. Another metric, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Long/Short Difference, backs up the bullish outlook. This indicator measures the unrealized profits of long-term holders compared to short-term ones. Ethereum’s MVRV is now at 5.67%, entering a positive zone that signals undervaluation. Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, notes that similar MVRV levels have historically led to significant price rallies. The last time Ethereum followed this pattern, its price surged to $4,100. If this trajectory holds, the current rally could still have plenty of room to run.

Cardano’s slow development pace hampers real-world adoption, while Dogecoin lacks innovation beyond its community-driven value. As a result, undervalued altcoins are developing advanced solutions and strategic growth, outpacing both. PropiChain , one of the top-rated altcoins, stands out with its groundbreaking blockchain solutions, innovative features, and strong potential to lead the cryptocurrency market. PropiChain: Revolutionizing Real Estate with Blockchain Technology PropiChain is a leader among undervalued altcoins, revolutionizing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. It makes it easy for investors to purchase shares in premium properties through blockchain-backed NFTs. This opens up real estate investments to individuals from different backgrounds, removing the barriers of traditional property ownership and creating more accessible entry points to the market. The platform integrates AI-powered tools for predictive analytics, streamlining property management, and improving investment decisions. Additionally, its decentralized finance (DeFi) applications offer lucrative staking rewards, allowing investors to earn while holding their tokens. PropiChain’s metaverse integration is another standout feature, enabling users to explore tokenized properties in a virtual environment. This digital and physical real estate blend provides an interactive and high-ROI experience. As one of the undervalued altcoins, BlockAudit has reviewed and audited Propichain’s credibility, security, and transparency. Furthermore, its listing on CoinMarketCap has also boosted its visibility, solidifying its position in the market. Currently in its presale phase , Propichain is offering tokens at competitive prices. Investors can purchase these tokens at a fraction of their expected post-launch value. Analysts project this undervalued altcoin will provide unparalleled ROI by 2025, positioning it as a must-try for investors seeking exponential growth. The platform enables investors to gain exposure to global real estate markets with low entry points, starting from as little as $0.004. This allows users to diversify their portfolios and access global properties through a transparent and accessible digital platform. PropiChain is making real estate investment more accessible and efficient than ever before. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Advancing Toward a Functional Ecosystem Shiba Inu is shaping its reputation amid a bull market by building a comprehensive ecosystem. With the launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 blockchain, Shiba Inu now supports faster and cheaper transactions. This scalability improvement has drawn in decentralized application (dApp) developers and bolstered its utility. Token burns, strategic partnerships, and a growing community contributed to SHIB’s market stability and future potential. However, its high dependence on speculative interest challenges its long-term competitiveness against other undervalued altcoins. TRON (TRX): Decentralized Infrastructure at Scale TRON is another undervalued altcoin with immense potential. Its blockchain supports up to 2,000 transactions per second, providing a robust infrastructure for decentralized applications. TRON’s affordability and energy efficiency make it a favorite among developers and enterprises. Recent upgrades to its ecosystem, such as the TRON Virtual Machine, have increased its appeal to investors. Still, questions about its centralization could hinder its ability to compete with other undervalued altcoins’ transparent frameworks. PropiChain: Your Best Bet for Market-Leading Returns PropiChain stands out as one of the most promising undervalued altcoins, with immense potential for growth in real estate investment. PropiChain offers a tangible, blockchain-powered solution through real estate tokenization, unlike speculative tokens like Dogecoin or Cardano, making it an innovative and practical choice. With tokens priced at $0.01275 in Stage 1, your $500 investment could secure approximately 39,215 tokens. And with a promising listing price of $0.4 to $0.6, your tokens could be worth roughly $15,686 and $23,529, an impressive return, right? As a result of all these innovations and technology, PCHAIN has become one of the best-undervalued altcoins for investors seeking measurable returns in the cryptocurrency market.

37294615,https://nulltx.com/?p=135314,1733499714,Trend Analysis Reveals Shocking Projections for XRP & INTL: Why Worldcoin Can Hit $4 in December,"As the cryptocurrency ecosphere faces high volatility, three crypto coins XRP, INTL, and Worldcoin (WLD) are garnering the attention of traders and investors. Ripple’s latest developments, IntelMarket’s success in the presale stage, and Worldcoin’s iconic World ID Passport Credential are turning out to be the dominant drivers of this crypto space. Trade analysts are speculating if Worldcoin can hit the target of $4 by December and whether new milestones for XRP and IntelMarkets will be hit. XRP’s Latest Development in Base Reserve Reduction The XRP ledger developers have brought major changes in the Ripple ecosphere by lowering the base reserve requirement for accounts to 1 XRP. In the past, the minimal reserve amount was 20 XRP and was later decreased to 10 XRP in 2021. This marks new changes within the Ripple ecosphere. The move would increase demand for XRP by making the token accessible to users. The market has recently seen a surge in the XRP price. The XRP is currently trading at $2.27. Moreover, Ripple (XRP) is surging due to legal victories. Worldcoin’s World ID Passport Credential – A Massive Win Worldcoin (WLD) is making big headlines due to the development of World ID Passport Credential, which is a breakthrough feature focussed on the enhancement of user privacy and worldwide accessibility. So far, this feature is being tested in various countries including South Korea, Colombia, Chile, and Malaysia, and is letting users link their passports smoothly and safely to their World ID with the help of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. All the data gets stored in user’s devices, maximizing privacy and reducing the risks involved in data breaches, which has never been done by conventional identification systems. The Passport Credential was discovered at ‘A New World’ event in the city of San Francisco and has positioned Worldcoin as a dominant player in decentralized identity verification. This new advancement is the need of the hour since data privacy is the leading concern of users throughout the globe, and is also a great value proposition for interested investors. The WLD is right now priced at $3.43. Trade analysts are expecting a price surge of Worldcoin and believe that the milestone of hitting $4 could happen by December. With the successful rollout of this Passport Credential and ever-increasing global footprint, WLD is set to have a considerable market share in a decentralized identity ecosystem.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-rescues-usa-trumpusa-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shib-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37294400,https://nulltx.com/?p=135310,1733499283,Cardano Price Prediction: ADA new all-time highs in 2025 and can next-gen altcoins keep surging?,"Cardano (ADA) has once again attracted the crypto spotlight with its latest historical feat. Hydra—Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution—has notably outperformed Visa by successfully performing 2 billion transactions in just four hours. This marks a huge achievement for Cardano, not only showcasing ADA’s innovative prowess but also strengthening its position in the DeFi space. Meanwhile, rising altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is creating a loud buzz among crypto insiders with its zero-gas technology and other Web3 innovations. JetBolt’s presale has soared to over 100 million tokens sold already. With Hydra’s remarkable success, could Cardano continue its upward trajectory towards setting new all-time highs in 2025? Or could JetBolt’s rising momentum be the catalyst for other next-gen altcoins to keep surging in the exciting days ahead? Let’s explore further. Cardano Price Prediction: Is ADA ready to set new all-time highs in 2025? In November, ADA surged to its highest level since April 2024 when murmurs circulated that Cardano’s co-founder, Charles Hoskins, would be helping reshape cryptocurrency policies in the U.S. under the Trump administration. 7-day Price chart of Cardano as per data from Coingecko website Adding to this momentum, Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra, recently processed 2 billion transactions in just four hours, surpassing Visa’s daily volume. This historic achievement underscores Cardano’s technical prowess and solidifies its position as a strong contender in the DeFi space. Currently trading at $1.19, Cardano has skyrocketed by an impressive 231.9% over the last 30 days, making ADA one of the heavy gainers among the top 10 biggest coins. However, analysts suggest that whales seem to have calmed down for now after accumulating ADA in November. The outlook for ADA remains optimistic, as reflected by its EMA lines, with short-term averages still above long-term ones. Analysts predict that if buying pressure holds, ADA could break through the $1.32 resistance level, with a potential further push to $1.40—a price ADA has not seen since 2022, and one that could trigger ADA’s climb to new highs in 2025 JetBolt: Surging in the Web3 space with zero-gas technology While Cardano strengthens its position, a young altcoin continues to gain traction in the Web3 space preparing the way for 2025: JetBolt (JBOLT). JetBolt’s zero-gas technology, which eliminates gas fees, is a fresh and innovative breakthrough that delivers practical benefits for both everyday users and developers. This feature enables users to make blockchain transactions minus the frustration over hefty gas costs, while empowering developers to more cost-efficiently work on decentralized applications (dApps). JetBolt also offers an intuitive Web3 wallet with advanced integrations like the WebAuthN protocol and face ID recognition, enabling easy access to and management of JetBolt tokens for both new and experienced crypto enthusiasts. As a next-generation innovation, JetBolt boasts an AI-powered insights tool that curates the latest market news and crypto insights to keep users informed of key developments in the rapidly changing crypto environment. Moreover, JetBolt’s advanced staking system has a unique social element—allowing users to enhance their rewards by connecting with friends on the platform. This feature not only boosts their earnings but enriches the staking activity by making it a fun and collaborative experience. Early adopters are also rewarded with presale bonus of up to 25% extra tokens when they avail of JetBolt’s special Alpha Boxes or token batch packages. It’s no surprise then that JetBolt’s presale has already sold over 100 million tokens, pointing to a growing interest from whales in this next-gen altcoin. With blockchain innovation at the core of its rising momentum, JetBolt is rapidly becoming a revolutionary altcoin that could continue surging in the crypto space. Final Thoughts: Will Cardano reach new all-time highs in 2025 as next-gen altcoins surge? The crypto market is open and ripe with exciting opportunities for all. Cardano is seizing every opportunity to pursue innovations and developments that will solidify ADA’s position in the fast-changing crypto economy, with the goal of staying relevant and focused on reaching new highs in 2025. Meanwhile, young altcoin JetBolt’s notable rise in the crypto space could signal a new era in Web3. Equipped with zero-gas technology and other next generation solutions with real-world impact, JetBolt is all geared up to keep charging ahead as the crypto world ushers into the year 2025.

However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as the superior alternative, poised for an explosive 89,000% presale rally that promises to create generational billions for early buyers. As the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale raises almost $2 million in revenue, investors seize the chance to secure tokens at $0.0243 before prices increase further. Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Top Investment Choice For Generational Wealth Over XRP While the XRP price continues to attract attention, with analysts predicting bullish activity that could make investors rich, a better alternative has emerged. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , a groundbreaking DeFi wallet, is disrupting the market as a more reliable path to generational billion-dollar profits. With an astonishing 89,000% rally projected in its presale, WallitIQ (WLTQ) will offer investors lifetime returns. Currently priced at $0.0243 as it enters a new presale stage, WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens are selling at their lowest possible price. Thousands of savvy investors are joining the presale as it sells out, with millions of tokens generating more than $1.9 million in revenue.

Analysts Predict XRP Price Will Overcome Declines And Make Investors Rich Analysts are forecasting significant gains for the XRP price, predicting it could make investors very rich as the price shows signs of recovery in the charts. After a prolonged consolidation phase between $1 and $2, the XRP price has broken free, surging 95% last week and an impressive 424% in the past month. Currently trading around $2.64, the XRP price steadily climbs from bearish control and extended stagnation. With the XRP price edging closer to its all-time high of $3, analysts believe a new peak is within reach, offering the potential for substantial returns. Meanwhile, its rival, WallitIQ (WLTQ), seems to magnet the attention of investors, with its forecasted 89,000% rally set to generate billions in profits. Why Investors Are Racing To Secure WallitIQ (WLTQ) Before It Explodes WallitIQ (WLTQ) is poised to dominate the crypto wallet and AI market by transforming how users trade, manage, and protect digital assets.

Market analysts believe WallitIQ (WLTQ) is on track to become one of the most profitable investments of the year, overshadowing even the XRP price's bullish potential. With massive sellouts already in its new presale stage and almost $2 million raised, it is only a matter of time before it sells out entirely. As WallitIQ (WLTQ) gears up for an explosive 89,000% rally, it’s no wonder buyers are scrambling to secure their spot in what’s guaranteed to make generational billions. As the presale rally continues to cause FOMO among crypto investors, time is running out for those who want to secure WallitIQ (WLTQ) at its current price of $0.0243 . With features that simplify trading, improve security, and provide real-world utility, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet is on track to surpass rivals and dominate the crypto market.

In a statement, the Treasury Department says it is imposing sanctions on those associated with the TGR Group, which uses digital assets, including the US dollar-pegged stablecoin USDT, to facilitate the financial activities of high-net-worth Russian nationals despite restrictions that were put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia-born Ukranian national George Rossi is believed to have overall control of the TGR Group. Other members and affiliates include Elena Chirkinyan, Andrejs Bradens, Khadzi-Murat Dalgatovich Magomedov and Nikita Vladimirovich Krasnov, according to OFAC. “As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the blocked persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.” The international network is believed to have laundered funds on behalf of sanctioned entities, provided unregistered services for exchanging cash and cryptocurrency, made cash value available to clients in the form of crypto, provided prepaid credit card services and obfuscated fund sources, which allowed wealthy Russians to buy properties in the United Kingdom. Says Bradley T. Smith, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, “Through the TGR Group, Russian elites sought to exploit digital assets—in particular US dollar-backed stablecoins—to evade US and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the Kremlin.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

37294226,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658322,1733499015,Has Bitcoin Reached Its Cycle Top? Insights From Leading Analysts,"Bitcoin experienced extreme volatility yesterday after reaching a new all-time high of $104,088 on Wednesday. What followed was a textbook “Darth Maul” candle on the daily chart, as BTC plummeted from $103,550 to as low as $90,500 before stabilizing. While some observers initially read the move as a harsh rejection at the psychologically significant $100,000 level, leading analysts suggest this could represent a routine market flush-out rather than a cyclical peak. Could This Be The Bitcoin Cycle Top? Traders and analysts on X present a unified narrative: the abrupt spike and subsequent plunge were likely orchestrated by large players capitalizing on high-leverage traders. Veteran trader IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) stated, “Bitcoin – Classic Darth Maul. Correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think we’ve seen an asset top with that kind of candle. Usually that’s the punish late longers, trap the shorters, and send it higher candle.” Another crypto analyst known as Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) added, “It’s just whales using the ‘rinse high leverage button.’ Before continuing whatever it was meant to do. I would want to see the downside of that wick cleared, but that could be it too.” Related Reading: Hut 8 Unveils $750 Million Initiative To Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Tony “The Bull” Severino, CMT, underscored the scale of these moves, noting: “An $11K ‘Darth Maul’ on the Bitcoin daily chart. Stops on both sides were run. Incredible intraday volatility in Bitcoin. Welcome to what it’s like for BTC to be $100K. $10,000 moves in a day are now a thing.” He followed up, “$100K Bitcoin is the new $10K,” sharing comparative charts from the 2020–2021 bull run and drawing parallels to the current price environment. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, reinforced this historical context: “Bitcoin. Yes, this is normal.” Edwards posted a similar chart, recalling the volatility when BTC was at $10,000 as well as $1,000 in early 2017. Key indicators also remain suggestive of further upside. According to Matthew Sigel, head of research at VanEck, top signals are scarce at these levels. “Aside from funding rates, which can stay elevated for some time, very few of our ‘top signals’ indicators say the cycle is peaking. The path of least resistance is still higher, in my opinion.” Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track To Replace Gold In 10 Years, Trading Firm Predicts Sigel referenced four key metrics: the MVRV Z-Score (still below 5), the Bitcoin Price SMA Multiplier (indicating room for further growth), subdued Google Trends, and Crypto Market Dominance at a mid-range level. These data points collectively imply that the current cycle may not be approaching its apex. Macro analyst Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) delivered another perspective: “Being asked if that was the top so allow me to share my view. In my book the first levered flush out of a strong bull run, particularly one driven by strong fundamentals, does not mark the top.” He noted that while the move was widely anticipated in general terms—albeit not precisely timed—it does not alter the underlying strength of Bitcoin’s rally. Krüger added that the sudden retail pivot to older, “dino” altcoins might have signaled a local top for those assets, but not necessarily for Bitcoin: “Nothing really has changed imo. Would have liked to see funding also reset on alts. Alas, we can’t get it all.” At press time, BTC traded at $98,146.

With over 200,000 holders already and a big listing coming soon on Binance, this coin is quickly growing in popularity. Investors are excited about its potential, and you might want to get in early before it becomes more well-known. In this article, we will discuss how this coin is different from XRP, why it's so popular, and what you need to know before jumping in. XRP surges to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency The XRP token, which is linked to Ripple Labs, has risen to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world, based on its market cap. This happened after a long period of rising prices, starting with President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in November and the growing belief that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might drop its legal case against Ripple Labs. On Monday, the price of XRP reached a more than 21% increase in just 24 hours and nearly a 50% rise compared to last week. Since Trump’s election win, XRP’s market value has grown from about $30 billion to $131 billion. Over the weekend, XRP’s market cap crossed $100 billion for the first time since 2018, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, surpassing Solana’s SOL. At one point, XRP even briefly overtook Tether’s USDT stablecoin in market value. However, it later settled just below it. Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has been valued at around $100,000 this past week, with a market cap of nearly $1.89 trillion. Ethereum’s Ether token follows with a market cap of $436 billion. What’s behind the surge in XRP’s price? While XRP’s price has been steadily climbing since Trump’s election, the big jump over the weekend happened after Fox Business reported that the New York Department of Financial Services might soon approve Ripple Labs' new RLUSD stablecoin. This stablecoin could be launched as early as December 4, which excited many investors and led to the price spike. Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, was sued by the SEC in 2020. The SEC claimed that Ripple was selling XRP tokens as a security without registering them. In July of the previous year, a federal judge ruled that Ripple had not broken the law by selling XRP on public exchanges. However, in October, the SEC appealed this decision, which is still pending. The price surge happened partly because people believe that the new government, led by Trump and his crypto-friendly policies, could bring an end to the SEC’s case. Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, who is a leading candidate to become the ""Crypto Czar"" in Trump’s administration, said that the SEC should drop its case against Ripple. DTX Exchange: A fast-growing crypto altcoin DTX Exchange (DTX) has been getting a lot of attention in the crypto market because of its amazing presale performance. So far, the price of DTX has jumped by 500%, and the presale is still in phase six, which means the price could go even higher. Recently, DTX was listed on CoinMarketCap, which has helped it reach millions of new investors. The DTX token will be the main currency used on the DTX Exchange, a new platform that combines the best features of both centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Right now, one DTX token is worth just $0.12. However, when phase seven of the presale starts, the price is expected to rise to $0.14. And after DTX is listed on a big exchange, the price could reach $0.20. This would mean a 100% return for anyone who buys now. Because of these exciting features, many investors have jumped in to buy DTX during its presale, pushing the total funds raised above $9.1 million. With such a low entry price and big potential for growth, experts believe DTX could be one of the best new cryptocurrencies to invest in.

37296407,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317700,1733498538,Bank of America Strategist Claims Crypto and Stock Markets are Overvalued,"The US stock and cryptocurrency markets could be overvalued following recent rallies , according to Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America (BofA). In a recent interview with Bloomberg , Hartnett warned of a potential “overshoot” if the S&P 500 approaches 6,666 points, which would be about 10% higher than its current level, suggesting a risky bubble formation in early 2025. Data from Bloomberg shows that the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio has climbed to 5.3 times in 2024, nearing the record high of 5.5 observed during the tech bubble in March 2000. Global Investors Exuberance Not Matching Stock Market Rise While the stock market has experienced a substantial rise, investors have not yet shown signs of exuberance, according to BofA’s bull-and-bear indicator. The S&P 500 has soared approximately 27% this year, marking its best performance since 2019. This surge is driven by enthusiasm surrounding AI and President-elect Donald Trump’s “America First” policies. Hartnett also mentioned the impact of Trump’s crypto stance, which contributed to Bitcoin’s temporary spike above $100,000 this week. With Bitcoin’s market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion , it now rivals the world’s 11th-largest economy. We’ve got a shirt for that! https://t.co/sojrQjrfOZ pic.twitter.com/NdLyRHW5Dl — Bitcoin Apparel Shop (@FOMO21shop) December 5, 2024 Bitcoin Surge Fueled by FOMO Bitcoin recently surpassed the $100,000 mark, reaching as high as $104,000. The surge is fueled by a mix of market euphoria and fear of missing out (FOMO), according to Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler. In a statement shared with Cryptonews.com, Lienkha said this momentum could potentially push Bitcoin’s price to between $110,000 and $150,000 in the absence of negative external factors. However, Lienkha noted that maintaining Bitcoin’s price below $100,000 without substantial market changes seems unlikely, given the current global optimism in equity markets. “Sustaining prices below $100,000 would likely require significant market shifts, such as increased pessimism in equity markets, which is an improbable scenario,” he wrote. “Instead, global equity markets are experiencing a robust Christmas rally, with new all-time highs recorded in the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Germany’s DAX index.” The correlation of Bitcoin with US stock indices is strong, suggesting that any downturn in equities could affect Bitcoin prices. Such sychronization could emerge early next year, according to Lienkha, influenced by retail sentiment, which remains a critical driver of crypto fluctuations. The current enthusiasm around altcoins, indicative of an “alt-season,” underscores the retail-driven nature of the latter stages of this bull run. Despite the bullish momentum, Lienkha cautions that signs point toward the end of this short-term cycle. Adding that a significant market correction is likely on the horizon. Looking forward to 2025, Lienkha identifies several risks that could dampen Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory. This includes negative economic signals from the US or a broad equity market downturn. Such developments could trigger a Bitcoin sell-off, exacerbated by the market’s high volatility and the prevalent use of leveraged trading among retail investors.

37294000,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107757,1733498538,Australian Regulator AUSTRAC Targets Crypto ATM Providers in Money Laundering Crackdown,"The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has unveiled plans to intensify enforcement measures against crypto ATM providers to curb money laundering activities. As part of its efforts, AUSTRAC will establish a specialized task force focusing on the cryptocurrency industry starting next year, Cointelegraph reported. Australia, the third-largest hub for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs, faces increasing scrutiny from regulators aiming to balance industry growth with financial security. AUSTRAC’s Crypto Enforcement Plan 1. New Task Force for Crypto Industry AUSTRAC is assembling a dedicated task force to monitor and regulate crypto ATM providers, with a focus on identifying and addressing potential money laundering schemes. Objective: Enhance oversight of crypto transactions and enforce compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Timeline: Enforcement efforts will intensify in 2025 , with a sharp focus on the crypto sector. 2. Hefty Penalties for Violators The regulator has warned of substantial fines for providers found in breach of AML regulations. Enforcement Goal: Deter illegal activities and ensure providers adhere to Australian financial laws. Australia’s Role in the Crypto ATM Ecosystem 1. Third-Largest Hub Globally Australia ranks as the third-largest market for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ATMs, reflecting its robust adoption of digital assets. Growth Drivers: Increasing acceptance of Bitcoin for transactions. High consumer demand for convenient access to crypto assets. 2. Challenges with Crypto ATMs While crypto ATMs offer easy access to digital assets, they have also been linked to: Unregulated transactions. Money laundering risks. The Implications of AUSTRAC’s Crackdown 1. Stricter Compliance Requirements Crypto ATM providers will need to: Register with AUSTRAC. Implement robust AML measures to avoid penalties. 2. Industry Impact The crackdown could: Deter illegal use of crypto ATMs. Increase operational costs for providers. Build trust among legitimate users by improving the industry’s reputation. Crypto Regulations: A Growing Trend 1. Global Crackdowns Australia’s move aligns with global trends, as regulators in the U.S., UK , and EU ramp up scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. Focus Areas: Money laundering prevention. Consumer protection. 2. Balancing Growth and Security AUSTRAC’s efforts aim to strike a balance between fostering innovation in crypto and ensuring financial system integrity. Conclusion AUSTRAC’s crackdown on crypto ATM providers marks a significant step in Australia’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies. By imposing stricter enforcement and hefty fines, the government seeks to curb money laundering while positioning the country as a secure hub for digital assets. As Australia takes a leading role in crypto regulation, other nations may follow suit, emphasizing the importance of compliance and transparency in the evolving crypto ecosystem.

37294114,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623771,1733498450,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell might win in a fight with Trump, but he can’t beat the crypto industry","Jerome Powell isn’t new to pressure, but he’s never had a storm like this. Between President-elect Donald Trump questioning his independence and crypto advocates demanding policy changes, Powell is juggling criticism from so many sides. Yet, he’s standing firm, refusing to bend to Trump’s threats or the growing political tension surrounding the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Trump has made Powell and the Fed his latest punching bags, accusing them of playing politics and even threatening a full-on hostile takeover. The Fed Chair, however, isn’t biting. Instead, he’s doubling down on the institution’s independence, brushing off Trump’s outbursts. And he’s had plenty. Trump turns on Powell, his own pick for Fed chair Donald Trump and Jerome Powell’s relationship started on a high note. Trump personally nominated Powell to lead the Federal Reserve in 2017, calling him a leader with “sound judgment.” Fast-forward six years, and the tune has changed. Trump now accuses Powell of manipulating interest rates for political gain. During his election campaign, the president told Fox News, “It looks to me like Powell is trying to lower interest rates for the sake of maybe getting the Democrats elected.” The irony isn’t lost on anyone. Legally, though, the president can’t simply dismiss the Federal Reserve Chair. The role is shielded from political interference, a cornerstone of the Fed’s independence. Powell has repeatedly emphasized this, stating, “We make decisions for all Americans, not for any political party.” When asked about the accusations at The New York Times DealBook Summit, Powell said, “I never discuss what elected officials say. I’m focused on the economy.” His focus, he says, remains on maintaining stability in what he calls a “remarkably strong” U.S. economy. He also said that if Trump does try to come for him, he’d fight back with all his legal might. And under US laws, he actually has enough to defeat the president. Scott Bessent, a potential pick for Treasury Secretary under Trump’s administration, has proposed creating a “shadow Fed Chair” to oversee monetary policy. According to Bessent, Powell’s influence has diminished to the point where “no one cares what Powell has to say anymore.” When confronted with Bessent’s comments, Powell dismissed the idea outright, saying, “I don’t think that’s on the table.” Powell also pointed out the importance of collaboration between the Fed and the Treasury, adding that the two institutions have maintained weekly meetings for decades. A national Bitcoin reserve? Trump also has his eyes on a bold new proposal : the BITCOIN Act of 2024. Introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis, the act aims to establish a national Bitcoin reserve, positioning the U.S. as a dominant force in the global crypto market. The plan is ambitious. Over five years, the government would purchase up to 1 million bitcoins, making the U.S. one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. To fund this, the proposal relies on two main sources: Gold Certificate Revaluation: The Federal Reserve currently holds gold certificates valued at $10.5 billion, based on an outdated price of $42 per ounce. If revalued to reflect today’s gold prices—closer to $643 billion—these certificates could bankroll a significant portion of the Bitcoin purchases. Federal Reserve Profits: The act proposes using $6 billion in surplus profits generated by the Federal Reserve from 2025 to 2029. Lummis believes the bill could pass within Trump’s first 100 days in office, provided it gains public and bipartisan support. But that’s where Mr. Powell comes in. Powell’s crypto problem Powell has historically never been a fan of crypto, focusing on their risks rather than their benefits. He has compared Bitcoin to gold, describing it as a speculative asset rather than a practical one. While this hasn’t stopped Bitcoin’s rise — prices recently surged past $100,000 — Powell’s skepticism poses a huge barrier to the Bitcoin Act’s success. As a Federal Reserve Chair who is loved and respected by both Trump’s own Congress and the Democrats, Powell holds massive influence over monetary policy, more than the president. He has the power to resist efforts that would reallocate Federal Reserve assets toward Bitcoin purchases. His concerns are rooted in the Fed’s dual mandate: maintaining price stability and maximizing employment. Bitcoin’s infamous volatility clashes with these goals, making Powell an unlikely ally for crypto enthusiasts. Still, he isn’t entirely anti-crypto. He has acknowledged the potential benefits of blockchain technology and has supported the idea of regulatory frameworks to govern the industry. But his focus remains on mitigating risks, a stance that could complicate the implementation of the Bitcoin Act.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fed-chair-jerome-powell-might-against-trump/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37294114.jpeg

Among them, a new DeFi coin has emerged. This new crypto offers massive growth potential despite being in its presale stage and its roadmap shows it will dominate the industry in 2025. Although Pepe (PEPE) and Solana (SOL) are recording bullish momentums, the new coin has proven to be the best cryptocurrency investment in this market. Do you want an investment that will deliver huge gains in the coming year? PEPE, SOL, and the new coin could be your best bets! Pepe Shows Massive Growth in the Crypto Market, Analysts Predict Surge to New Highs Pepe recorded massive growth in November as more investors rushed to buy, targeting huge profits. PEPE gained over 130% on the monthly chart. Nonetheless, the meme coin has encountered challenges crossing the resistance that has formed at $0.0000221 and dropped in a pullback. If this resistance is broken, market experts say PEPE will explode to new highs. AlejandroBTC, a renowned analyst, stated that PEPE’s price may explode to new all-time highs in December 2024. He highlighted a crypto market chart that shorted PEPE, breaking the $0.0000320 level in this bull market. Another popular analyst, Crypto Candy, re-echoed a similar forecast. Their chart showed PEPE surpassing $0.0000301. Looking into the future, nearly all PEPE technical indicators are bullish. PEPE was valued at $0.0000212 on December 2, 2024, up 5.26% in the last week. Market experts say PEPE will rise to $0.0000248 in December. Although PEPE is bullish, investors consider the new DeFi coin the best cryptocurrency in this bull run because of its massive growth potential. Solana's DEX Network Hits Record Milestones, Analysts Predict Price Surge to $300 Solana’s DEX network thrived in November 2024 as the crypto market thrived. Notably, the ecosystem hit record-breaking milestones as monthly trading volumes surpassed $109 billion. This remarkable growth represents a 108% gain from October's $52.49 billion, as reported by DeFiLlama. On that note, Raydium dominated Solana’s DEX sector with nearly 63% of weekly volume and processed over $780 billion in November. Furthermore, the active addresses on Solana also surged to 25 million, according to Glassnode, highlighting growth in user participation. Crypto market analysts say SOL’s price will continue rising, with indicators pointing to a potential $300. SOL gained 61% between November 5 and November 22, reaching highs of $263 amid these strong network metrics and increased adoption. Despite a recent pullback, SOL is expected to resume its bullish momentum. SOL traded at $226 on December 2, 2024, down 7.36% in the past week. Analysts say SOL will rise again to $268 this month. Despite the projected growth, investors are turning to a new DeFi coin targeting the highest profits in this bull cycle. DTX Exchange: A New Crypto Project with Hybrid Blockchain and 120,000 Asset Classes The DTX Exchange (DTX) ecosystem is powered by a hybrid blockchain, VulcanX. According to the team, the hybrid blockchain has a unique design to help maintain the DTX platform’s operation. DTX Exchange caters to traders and non-traders who access several use cases. The platform has many tradable assets, including crypto, bonds, stocks, and other equity products, coupled with foreign currencies.

37293593,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108116,1733497813,Anaxi Labs and Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab Unveil a Breakthrough Proof System,"Pittsburgh, United states, December 6th, 2024, Chainwire Anaxi Labs , in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab , the university’s cybersecurity and privacy institute, is announcing a compiler framework for cryptography that resolves an impasse – building scalable applications with Zero-Knowledge require fundamental trade-offs. The elusive trifecta of scalable, cryptographically-secured and decentralized applications have been considered impossible, and a barrier to mass adoption — until now. A Breakthrough in Cryptography with No Trade-Offs Blockchains such as Ethereum have been hailed as the future of decentralized infrastructure, with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology heralded to enhance Ethereum’s security and scalability beyond 120 TPS. According to the team, developing ZK proofs is complex and time-consuming, requiring thousands of hours across dozens of developers. Prioritizing speed in proof generation also means manually designing protocols, and with manual coding and tens of thousands of lines of code this introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This complicates the creation of security-sensitive decentralized applications and makes auditability and compliance a nightmare – all hindrances to widespread adoption in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare and AI. A team of Carnegie Mellon researchers is collaborating with Anaxi Labs to overcome this trade-off CMU’s recent paper presents a revolutionary way to directly compile high-level software and convert it into simpler forms (low-level representations) needed for underlying proof systems to work. And all this is done automatically, repeatable and auditable, getting rid of the manual work, drastically improving performance while cryptographically ensuring security of the process. The work achieves this by analyzing the high-level program, breaking the program into small, indivisible units, then creating low-level representation from each unit that can be easily inputted into varieties of proof systems. “This idea of breaking the computation into very specific chunks that take the place of a CPU in an automatic way is a new approach, and this is the first time that somebody has attempted this kind of approach where we avoid the full program representation for the compiler,” said Riad Wahby, assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon University’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering . “We’re extremely excited about it.” Unlocking New Decentralized Applications The research and the framework Anaxi Labs is building from the research are set to revolutionize industries in Web3 and beyond. In traditional and regulated finance, the performance boost while maintaining auditability enables real-time settlement of intrabank transfers like instant USD payments. In healthcare, amid challenges faced by 23andMe, secure and privacy-preserving encryption tools enabled by product being developed by Anaxi Labs, could now address critical concerns and safely utilize private genetic information by ensuring rightful ownership of one’s DNA, while enabling valuable research. Within the realm of enterprise AI and critical physical infrastructures, a decentralized solution that requires high availability and close to zero latency such as rapid fine-tuning and inference across multiple data and compute power resources becomes a reality. In the immediate term, products based on the research provide the most effective solution for Web3 companies grappling with the scalability, security and decentralization trade-offs, offering a new design paradigm for rollups and interoperability. “This research and the product we are building incorporating the research will have profound implication to many important industry applications today that need a safe solution for their massive performance overheads, such as ZK and EVM, finally bringing us to the doorstep of our vision of cryptographically-secured decentralized consensus with real-time settlement,” said Kate Shen, co-founder of Anaxi Labs. “We also like the fact that it is language and library agnostic, meaning a wide variety of projects can benefit from this without code modification. This enabled us to build an open, collaborative framework as opposed to the increasingly static, monolithic approaches today,” Shen adds. “This enables all developers to automatically choose and combine the best of the latest advancements in proof systems such as lookups, co-processors and hardware acceleration; maximizing the performance gains of each computational substrate.” Anaxi Labs and CyLab, a Game-Changing Partnership Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab has been at the center of cutting-edge research that’s served as the foundation for blockchain development – including Zero-Knowledge. Notable faculty researchers from CyLab include esteemed professor Bryan Parno, a critical contributor to the history of ZK whose lab produced the widely cited Nova paper series , and assistant professor Riad Wahby, whose findings resulted in new cryptographic technologies that realized visions of the Ethereum Foundation (and more recently, the pathbreaking Jolt zkVM implementation by Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, a16z crypto). The findings set forth in this compiler framework are the result of the second research project originating from the symbiotic partnership between Anaxi Labs and CyLab through the CMU Secure Blockchain Initiative. This partnership enables CMU academics to collaborate and learn from the insights gleaned from the commercial deployments of their blockchain research, spearheaded by Anaxi Labs, for both Web3 and Web 2.0 applications. It enables them to find commercial solutions to major existing issues with blockchain that fails to bridge the gap between the known benefits of blockchain technology, and mass adoption. And it also serves as a springboard for CMU students to launch their careers in Web3. “Anaxi Labs’ partnership with CyLab advances CMU researchers’ ability to work on projects with direct, real-world applications, ensuring that their work has practical relevance and potential for impact,” said Michael Lisanti, CyLab’s Senior Director of Partnerships.

37293500,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/anaxi-labs-and-carnegie-mellon-universitys-cylab-unveil-a-breakthrough-proof-system,1733497570,Anaxi Labs and Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab Unveil a Breakthrough Proof System,"Pittsburgh, United states, December 6th, 2024, Chainwire Anaxi Labs , in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab , the university’s cybersecurity and privacy institute, is announcing a compiler framework for cryptography that resolves an impasse – building scalable applications with Zero-Knowledge require fundamental trade-offs. The elusive trifecta of scalable, cryptographically-secured and decentralized applications have been considered impossible, and a barrier to mass adoption — until now. A Breakthrough in Cryptography with No Trade-Offs Blockchains such as Ethereum have been hailed as the future of decentralized infrastructure, with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology heralded to enhance Ethereum's security and scalability beyond 120 TPS. According to the team, developing ZK proofs is complex and time-consuming, requiring thousands of hours across dozens of developers. Prioritizing speed in proof generation also means manually designing protocols, and with manual coding and tens of thousands of lines of code this introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This complicates the creation of security-sensitive decentralized applications and makes auditability and compliance a nightmare – all hindrances to widespread adoption in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare and AI. A team of Carnegie Mellon researchers is collaborating with Anaxi Labs to overcome this trade-off CMU’s recent paper presents a revolutionary way to directly compile high-level software and convert it into simpler forms (low-level representations) needed for underlying proof systems to work. And all this is done automatically, repeatable and auditable, getting rid of the manual work, drastically improving performance while cryptographically ensuring security of the process. The work achieves this by analyzing the high-level program, breaking the program into small, indivisible units, then creating low-level representation from each unit that can be easily inputted into varieties of proof systems. “This idea of breaking the computation into very specific chunks that take the place of a CPU in an automatic way is a new approach, and this is the first time that somebody has attempted this kind of approach where we avoid the full program representation for the compiler,” said Riad Wahby, assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon University’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering . “We’re extremely excited about it.” Unlocking New Decentralized Applications The research and the framework Anaxi Labs is building from the research are set to revolutionize industries in Web3 and beyond. In traditional and regulated finance, the performance boost while maintaining auditability enables real-time settlement of intrabank transfers like instant USD payments. In healthcare, amid challenges faced by 23andMe, secure and privacy-preserving encryption tools enabled by product being developed by Anaxi Labs, could now address critical concerns and safely utilize private genetic information by ensuring rightful ownership of one’s DNA, while enabling valuable research. Within the realm of enterprise AI and critical physical infrastructures, a decentralized solution that requires high availability and close to zero latency such as rapid fine-tuning and inference across multiple data and compute power resources becomes a reality. In the immediate term, products based on the research provide the most effective solution for Web3 companies grappling with the scalability, security and decentralization trade-offs, offering a new design paradigm for rollups and interoperability. “This research and the product we are building incorporating the research will have profound implication to many important industry applications today that need a safe solution for their massive performance overheads, such as ZK and EVM, finally bringing us to the doorstep of our vision of cryptographically-secured decentralized consensus with real-time settlement,” said Kate Shen, co-founder of Anaxi Labs. “We also like the fact that it is language and library agnostic, meaning a wide variety of projects can benefit from this without code modification. This enabled us to build an open, collaborative framework as opposed to the increasingly static, monolithic approaches today,” Shen adds. “This enables all developers to automatically choose and combine the best of the latest advancements in proof systems such as lookups, co-processors and hardware acceleration; maximizing the performance gains of each computational substrate.” Anaxi Labs and CyLab, a Game-Changing Partnership Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab has been at the center of cutting-edge research that’s served as the foundation for blockchain development – including Zero-Knowledge. Notable faculty researchers from CyLab include esteemed professor Bryan Parno, a critical contributor to the history of ZK whose lab produced the widely cited Nova paper series , and assistant professor Riad Wahby, whose findings resulted in new cryptographic technologies that realized visions of the Ethereum Foundation (and more recently, the pathbreaking Jolt zkVM implementation by Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, a16z crypto). The findings set forth in this compiler framework are the result of the second research project originating from the symbiotic partnership between Anaxi Labs and CyLab through the CMU Secure Blockchain Initiative. This partnership enables CMU academics to collaborate and learn from the insights gleaned from the commercial deployments of their blockchain research, spearheaded by Anaxi Labs, for both Web3 and Web 2.0 applications. It enables them to find commercial solutions to major existing issues with blockchain that fails to bridge the gap between the known benefits of blockchain technology, and mass adoption. And it also serves as a springboard for CMU students to launch their careers in Web3. “Anaxi Labs’ partnership with CyLab advances CMU researchers’ ability to work on projects with direct, real-world applications, ensuring that their work has practical relevance and potential for impact,” said Michael Lisanti, CyLab’s Senior Director of Partnerships.

Table of Contents Simon’s Cat approaches falling wedge breakout Catslap rockets 142% on jump trading investment Goatseus maximumus breaks downtrend with huge upside potential Bitcoin has confirmed the bull market is back, breaking out past $100K for the first time ever. And after a brief dip last week, new emerging meme coins have started to break out, with top analysts suggesting that huge gains could be on the horizon. Three of those showing the most strength today are Simon’s Cat, Catslap, and Goatseus Maximus. Simon’s Cat approaches falling wedge breakout After two weeks of retracement, Simon’s Cat is on the verge of an explosive breakout. Prominent crypto trader Bluntz was among those to catch the recent move, writing that it is “on the verge of being so back” as its price storms into a key resistance level. CAT has been forming a falling wedge chart pattern, which often results in a strong break to the upside. $cat breaking out now. for the most part memes took a 3 week breather but they are on the verge of being ""so back"" imo. pick your favorites and hold. pic.twitter.com/h3YuVilAjY — Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) December 4, 2024 Bluntz did not provide a target for how far he thinks Simon’s Cat could go, although his tweet alludes to the fact that an uptrend continuation will ensue. CAT is up 78% this month and 255% since CoinMarketCap began tracking its price data in August. It holds a $317 million market cap and a $113 million 24-hour trading volume. Bluntz isn’t the only one who thinks Simon’s Cat will keep running. Unipcs, aka “The Bonk Guy,” dubbed Simon’s Cat as his favorite meme coin pick. The analyst noted that Simon’s Cat is a BNB-native meme coin, and the fact that the BNB coin has just flipped SOL adds to the project’s bullish outlook. “I won’t rule out CAT pulling a monster rally soon off the back of the BNB momentum,” he wrote. https://twitter.com/theunipcs/status/1864246984653070371 You might also like: Bitcoin price can hit $200k in 2025, but crossing $122k will be crucial Catslap rockets 142% on jump trading investment But there is a new cat-themed meme coin in town. Catslap is an Etherum -based cat coin that brings multiple novel innovations to market. Notably, it has a “Slap-to-Earn” game where users can generate income for slapping celebrities with a cat, alongside features like stalking, burning, and token buybacks. The project launched less than two weeks ago but has already gathered massive momentum. It received a $500K investment from Chicago-based institutional money house Jump Trading. The newsbreak caused a FOMO-driven rally as investors scrambled to buy what could be the next major cat coin. Currently, Catslap is trading at $0.007367, up 142% in the last seven days. It has a $33 million market cap and a $5.5 million 24-hour trading volume. Jump Trading’s investment shows the Catslap team is well connected, which could lead to a big exchange listing. On exchange listings, the project is making a “major announcement” today, which will reveal a centralized exchange on which SLAP will launch soon. Excitement about the project’s future is high among analysts. Fred Crypto recently said the SLAP price could increase by 90x. Goatseus maximumus breaks downtrend with huge upside potential Prominent crypto trader MacroCGR spotlighted Goatseus Maximums, noting that “no one is talking about this breakout.” As the AI agent meta became saturated, Goatseus Maximumus experienced a cooldown, with its price retracing from highs of $1.35 to $0.6. However, the $0.6 mark provided strong support, and now traders are pointing toward a recovery for GOAT. No one talk about this $GOAT break out Don't even mention it pic.twitter.com/4j52fysMhA — CRG (@MacroCRG) December 4, 2024 Analyst King Charts also noted that GOAT has found strong support and suspects the next move could propel it toward $2. $GOAT Breaking out send it 2$ pic.twitter.com/gqLLDIrLY1 — Kings Charts (@KingsCharts) December 4, 2024 Beyond its allure as the first AI agent meme coin, another factor driving interest in GOAT is the potential of a Coinbase listing. Binance listed GOAT’s rival Act I: The AI Prophecy, so there is every chance that Coinbase lists GOAT to level the playing field. Both exchanges have recently engaged in a high-stakes meme coin listing battle recently, with Coinbase listing four meme coins in the last seven days. $GOAT is the next big move, aligned with Coinbase and one leading the AI meta. Currently at around $0.70, it’s an incredible entry point, especially since it’s already tested $1.30. With a Coinbase listing coming soon, this memecoin is set to skyrocket. pic.twitter.com/lZwU284uRm — Grey BTC (@greybtc) December 3, 2024 Read more: Meme coin Catslap rallies 46% after slap-to-earn and token burn announcements Disclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page.

37293128,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390291,1733496901,"New Meme Coin Attracting Attention From Pepe Investors, 100x Gains Predicted","The post New Meme Coin Attracting Attention From Pepe Investors, 100x Gains Predicted appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In less than 48 hours, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has gone from a rookie to a meme coin titan, racking up over $1.1 million in funding during its presale launch. This Jordan Belfort-esque Pepe coin reboot is amassing an army of hungry traders who are tired of marginal gains and are now choosing rich. And it couldn’t have launched at a better time. With Bitcoin crossing $100K for the first time in history, a wave of new retail investors are scrambling to enter the market, taking positions and pumping up prices of crypto assets across the board. Prominent traders are betting on Wall Street Pepe as a potential top performer, thanks to its relation to two viral pop culture characters. But Wall Street Pepe is not just a hype job. It’s equipping its community with exclusive trading insights and alpha calls to level the playing field, organizing small fish into a swarm that can outmaneuver crypto whales and catch the biggest gains. And right now, investors can take advantage of the lowest-ever price. $WEPE is currently available to buy at $0.000203, but this will rise throughout the presale, with the next increase in three days. Wall Street Pepe Gives Retail Traders The Chance To Catch The Next Big Wave Are you tired of watching early investors run victory laps while you feel like you’re counting pennies? You’re not alone. Bitcoin crossing $100K was a staunch reminder that even in crypto, not everyone wins at the same rate. Those who bought Bitcoin in earlier years may have been able to retire and live a luxurious life based on Bitcoin crossing $100K, while those who bought in November 2021 have barely beaten the S&P 500. It’s the same story for meme coins. The gains this year have been significant. For instance, Dogecoin is up 115%, Shiba Inu is up 224%, and Pepe is up 131%. Yes, they’re solid returns. However, they won’t make you a millionaire (unless you start with a few hundred thousand dollars). And the reason most people are in crypto is not to beat the S&P – it’s to change their lives dramatically. Early investors were the only people who made serious money from the moves above. For instance, Pepe is up 37,900% since CoinMarketCap began tracking its price movements in April 2023. Someone who invested $100 in Pepe back then would now be sitting on $3.79 million. But most people could only dream of being that early. Enter the new and improved Pepe: Wall Street Pepe . Not only can investors buy today at presale before it’s even listed on the open market, but Wall Street Pepe comes with a suite of professional-grade tools that help its users thrive in the PvP meme coin market. $WEPE Community Could Become A Premier Trading Cabal Indeed, Wall Street Pepe holds the same viral allure as Pepe and other top meme coins, but it offers much more than that. Think of it akin to the Wall Street Bets community, which overthrew Wall Street’s top institutional traders through organized and well-executed trading strategies. The project offers a wide range of institutional-grade tools to ensure that its community is equipped to maximize profits in the ongoing bull market. It offers trading alpha, which comprises trading insights, signals, and alpha calls that help its users make better data-based decisions when buying and selling meme coins. There’s also a private insider group where users can collude on the best meme coins to buy and entry and exit strategies to minimize price impact while maximizing gains. This will allow them to beat whales at their own game. Meanwhile, the team is running a trading rewards program where users can submit their trade ideas and will receive free $WEPE tokens if the team uses them. Lastly, there’s staking, which allows users to put their $WEPE tokens to work and generate passive income by locking them in the project’s staking contract. Missed Pepe? Wall Street Pepe is the next 100x If you missed getting into Pepe early, Wall Street Pepe is your next opportunity to potentially turn a $1K investment into $100K or more. Prominent crypto analyst Jacob Bury underscored the project’s 100x potential in a recent video, noting that the presale offers investors a chance to buy at the “lowest possible price.” Bury underlines that this means you can get in before everyone else, so later investors will pump up your bags like you did for early Pepe investors. Prospective buyers can purchase $WEPE from the project’s website by connecting their wallet and choosing the amount of tokens they want to buy and the crypto they want to pay with. Alternatively, they can download the Best Wallet app from the App Store or Google Play Store and purchase via its Upcoming Tokens feature.

The chart shows major accumulation and distribution zones that could act as support or resistance levels. Bitcoin CBD | Glassnode Glassnode analysts confirmed that the $39,000–$40,000 range saw the highest accumulation in the past year, with 322,000 BTC purchased. However, they also flagged a liquidity gap below $88,000, where minimal Bitcoin changed hands. This lack of trading activity could amplify volatility if Bitcoin retraces to this level. Further, the $62,000–$64,000 range is another major accumulation zone, which served as a foundation for Bitcoin’s rally past $100,000 . More recently, the $96,000–$98,000 range emerged as an important support zone, with over 101,000 BTC accumulated in the last month. Meanwhile, approximately 81,000 BTC were acquired above $98,000, forming a short-term resistance level. Glassnode Analysts Identify Major Bitcoin LevelsNotably, market analyst Doctor Profit also pointed out Bitcoin’s recent descent to $90,000 before rebounding in a report today. https://twitter.com/DrProfitCrypto/status/1865021394574078326He expects the industry firstborn to trade within a range between $90,000 and $110,000 through the end of the year. According to him, this range will define Bitcoin's next major price movement, as traders look for confirmation of long-term bullish momentum. Meanwhile, veteran analyst Michaël van de Poppe highlighted the heightened volatility following Bitcoin’s recent push above $100,000. He attributed the sharp pullback to liquidations and stop-loss triggers as the market sought to rebalance. Van de Poppe believes that the $96,000–$97,000 range is extremely important. A drop below this level could trigger a more severe flash crash, exacerbating pain for traders on the long side. BTC Needs to Breach $100,000 AgainDespite the recent volatility , he remains optimistic, predicting that a successful break above $100,000 will reignite bullish momentum and push Bitcoin toward higher highs. https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1864944362087428425In addition, he noted that altcoins have shown resilience during Bitcoin's latest retracement. This stability could set the stage for an altcoin rally if Bitcoin consolidates in the current range. Generally, investors should watch Bitcoin’s behavior around the $96,000–$98,000 range. This zone is a major support area, while resistance above $98,000 could cap upward momentum in the short term. Below $96,000, there is limited trading activity, which could lead to heightened volatility. Meanwhile, a sustained breakout above $100,000 could mark the start of a new bull phase, especially if liquidity stabilizes. At press time, Bitcoin trades for $98,723, up 1.57% today.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/06/itcoin-hits-100k-briefly-before-retracing-cbd-metric-reveals-key-levels/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=itcoin-hits-100k-briefly-before-retracing-cbd-metric-reveals-key-levels,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Imagine investing just $250 in a coin priced at $0.003 and turning it into $83,000 by 2025. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, buckle in because this isn’t hype—it’s grounded in potential, tech innovation, and a rapidly growing ecosystem. 🚀 For crypto enthusiasts, DeFi investors, and financial analysts alike, all eyes should be on Lightchain AI's LCAI token. This isn’t your ordinary coin; it’s backed by some of the most groundbreaking technologies in blockchain and AI. But before you hit that “buy” button, let’s unpack why this coin is making waves and how it might just become the next big thing in the crypto space. What is Lightchain AI (LCAI), and Why Does It Matter? Lightchain isn’t just another blockchain. It’s an AI-powered ecosystem that brings together cutting-edge concepts like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and an Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These innovations aim to revolutionize decentralized applications (dApps) and governance. Here’s what makes it stand out: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms, PoI rewards nodes for performing meaningful AI computations, like model training and optimization. This isn’t just hype—it’s actionable utility. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Think of this as the “brain” of Lightchain. It’s designed to process advanced AI tasks directly on the blockchain, enabling smarter, scalable dApps. Tokenomics Built for Growth: With an initial price of $0.003 per LCAI token and a total supply designed for scalability, the financial model is structured to reward early adopters. When combined, these features don’t just promise innovation. They deliver it. Why $250 Could Turn You Into the Next Success Story 🌟 If you're calculating the potential return on a $250 investment, here's how it could look: At a current price of $0.003, $250 buys you approximately 83,333 LCAI tokens. If this token rises to $1.00 by 2025, you’re looking at a profit of over $83,000. That’s a jaw-dropping 33,200% ROI! Sure, it’s speculative, but with Lightchain’s foundation in AI technology and decentralized governance, the potential for exponential growth is hard to ignore. Innovation Takes Center Stage – The Core Tech Behind Lightchain 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): The Future of Consensus Most blockchains rely on either PoW (Bitcoin) or PoS (Ethereum) to validate transactions. Lightchain’s PoI takes things to a whole new level. Instead of just using computational power or staked tokens, PoI incentivizes nodes to contribute valuable AI computations like machine learning and data analysis. Why does this matter? PoI doesn’t just validate transactions—it actively pushes AI technology forward. It's efficient, scalable, and smarter than anything we’ve seen before. 2. The Game-Changing Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) The AIVM is where the magic happens. Developers can use this powerful AI-on-blockchain environment to deploy and execute decentralized applications with advanced data-driven functionality. For example, a retail dApp on Lightchain could use the AIVM to analyze customer purchasing trends and predict what products to stock next. This ability to integrate and leverage AI sets Lightchain apart as a blockchain built for the future. 3. Community-Driven Innovation Lightchain isn’t just about technology. It’s also deeply aligned with community values. Token holders can propose and vote on decisions through a decentralized governance system, ensuring the ecosystem evolves in line with its users' needs. After all, the only thing better than owning a token that could appreciate wildly is having a say in how it grows. 🙌 How Does Lightchain Stack Up in the Crypto Ecosystem? The world of crypto is crowded, but Lightchain manages to stand out. Other platforms often over-promise and under-deliver, but Lightchain’s mechanisms are already operational and available during its Presale Stage 6. Here’s a quick comparison to highlight the growing hype behind LCAI: Feature Lightchain AI Ethereum Solana Consensus Mechanism Proof of Intelligence Proof of Stake Proof of Stake AI Integration Native None None Decentralized Governance Yes Limited Limited Current Token Price $0.003 $1,650+ $20+ Scalability High - AI-Focused Standard Higher With its seamless blend of AI and blockchain, Lightchain isn’t just aiming to compete.

But despite Bitcoin’s bullish performance, meme coins have been the clear winner in 2024. So, what are the best ones to buy now that could explode as we approach Christmas? Crypto All-Stars Meme coins are risky. While they can provide big gains, they’re volatile and often take deep retracements. That’s why Crypto All-Stars is proving a fan favorite. It’s not an average meme coin, it’s building the world’s first meme coin staking app, letting users generate passive revenue by staking cryptos like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, and Brett. By introducing an innovative and novel utility, Crypto All-Stars separates itself from other meme coins and creates a utility-driven demand stream for its token, helping offset some of the downside volatility. When the All-Stars have got your back, You're Invincible! pic.twitter.com/SZhF0svSZc — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 5, 2024 Users who want to stake their tokens with Crypto All-Stars must hold $STARS, and the more they have, the more they can earn. This means all the top meme coin communities are incentivized to buy as much $STARS as possible. The project is undergoing a presale and has raised $9.1 million so far. However, the $STARS ICO ends in 14 days, so $STARS will be listed on exchanges just in time for Christmas. Shiba Inu Dogecoin has taken the market by storm recently, soaring over 100% in the past month. However, the tide is turning, and Shiba Inu is starting to outpace the market leader. Every dog has his day. SHIB is up 57% in the past month, but swiftly closing the gap on DOGE. We are likely witnessing liquidity rotating from Dogecoin to Shiba Inu as DOGE investors rebalance their portfolios and aim to maximize their gains elsewhere. $shib it's simple, as soon as this area is broken the Xs are going to come FAST! pic.twitter.com/cXrs82ONos — Trading Benjamins (@tradinbenjamins) December 5, 2024 Like Crypto-All Stars, Shiba Inu holds an advantage over other meme coins (like Dogecoin) in that it has real utility. For instance, the project has a layer 2 blockchain, staking, and a Play-to-Earn game. Currently, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.0000309. It’s down 1.5% in the past day but up 19.7% this week and 60.3% this month. It has an $18.2 billion market cap and a $2.97 billion 24-hour trading volume. Flockerz Flockerz is a newly launched meme coin introducing a concept of community governance. With this project, all token holders can vote on every decision relating to its future via its “decentralized autonomous organization” (DAO). This means that every decision will be democratized and should have the community’s best interests at heart. POV: The post-vote glow hits hard! pic.twitter.com/B8g5L3OSV2 — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 5, 2024 Another impressive element of this project is that users will even get paid to participate in the DAO. They’re calling it “Vote-to-Earn.” During the last bull market, Play-to-Earn and Move-to-Earn cryptos provided massive gains. Could Vote-to-Earn be this bull run’s viral narrative? The project is currently undergoing a presale, meaning investors can buy $FLOCK at what could be the lowest-ever price. The Flockerz presale has raised $4.6 million so far and is currently priced at $0.0062494. However, this price will rise throughout the ICO, with the next increase in one day. Dogwifhat In crypto, momentum is everything. And right now, Dogwifhat has it in spades. After weeks of underperforming other meme coins, Dogwifhat is back on top. It’s the best-performing top seven, pumping by over 5% in the past 24 hours. WIF is now veering towards its November high, and after that, the next target would be its all-time high (ATH), which was set in March 2024. buying $WIF $2.75-$3.0 $10 by Christmas $100 by top of the market pic.twitter.com/aG5OfoanQO — Ansem (@blknoiz06) November 12, 2024 Currently, WIF is just 28% from its ATH.

As a partner at Craft Ventures, Sacks is an indirect investor in Solana, a blockchain he believes holds the potential to surpass Ethereum as the leading smart contract platform.Sacks' investment ties to Solana date back to 2017, when Craft Ventures invested in Multicoin Capital, a venture capital firm that was one of Solana's early backers.While discussing the investment, Sacks described the move as a calculated bet on a nascent crypto market. This decision has since paid off massively. Specifically, the Solana-related fund achieved a return of about 100x, generating over $1 billion in returns.Why Sacks Believes in SolanaDespite market turbulence, including the FTX collapse that cast shadows on Solana , Sacks has remained optimistic. He revealed that he chose to hold his Solana positions, expressing confidence in the blockchain's technical advantages and long-term potential. “Solana represents a faster, cheaper alternative to Ethereum,” Sacks remarked in a podcast, highlighting Solana's fraction-of-a-penny transaction costs and superior scalability. These features have made Solana increasingly attractive for NFTs and decentralized applications, presenting it as a strong contender to Ethereum in blockchain.Sacks also noted the growing sentiment in Silicon Valley that Solana could eventually “flip” Ethereum, becoming the preferred platform for developers and users. While Ethereum remains dominant, Sacks believes Solana's technical strengths provide a pathway to rival Ethereum’s market position. In his words back in 2022: “Even if it doesn’t flip Ethereum, it’s the number eight crypto right now. People are betting it could go to number three or higher.” Indeed, Solana’s market position has improved over the years. It currently ranks as the fifth biggest crypto by market cap, despite having recently been overtaken by XRP.Sacks’ New Role in Shaping U.S. Policy on AI and CryptoIn his new role as the White House Director of AI and Crypto Tech, Sacks will steer policies that ensure America's dominance in these sectors. He will collaborate with key stakeholders to establish the framework for the crypto industry, offering the long-awaited legal clarity.Additionally, Sacks will focus on protecting free speech online, addressing the bias and censorship issues often associated with major tech companies.With a successful track record as an investor and entrepreneur, Sacks founded the influential company Yammer, which was acquired by Microsoft and served as PayPal’s COO during its early days.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | ZRX,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/06/trumps-crypto-czar-david-sacks-invested-in-solana-believes-it-could-overtake-ethereum/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=trumps-crypto-czar-david-sacks-invested-in-solana-believes-it-could-overtake-ethereum,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Previous cycle favorites such as Cardano (+201%), Ripple (+225%), Polkadot (+121%), and Stellar (+477%) posted extraordinary gains as retail investors returned to their Coinbase accounts. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) (+43%) and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) (+37%) continued to climb on the back of increased on-chain activity and evolving technical roadmaps. The favorable post-election regulatory environment in the U.S. has sparked several notable pivots: Binance revealed plans for a high-yield stablecoin, while Consensys, a major Ethereum contributor, announced a token launch for its L2 blockchain in Q2 2025. Ethena announced it will implement a fee switch to provide its ENA token holders with direct distributions of revenues from its application. This move has prompted speculation that other DeFI protocols will follow Ethena’s lead, given the improved regulatory environment. For example, L2 projects such as Arbitrum and Starknet proposed enabling native token staking to reward holders. After years of regulatory uncertainty discouraging value-accrual mechanisms, many projects clearly feel emboldened by the U.S. government’s expectations of reduced enforcement actions.

Ethereum Update and New Roadmap Ethereum Blob Space Shows Life Source: Dune @Hilldobby as of 11/26/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. ETH (+43%) had a solid month of performance and retraced some of its relative underperformance against BTC (+38%). This performance was catalyzed by a pick-up in on-chain activity and the release of a refined technical roadmap. While Ethereum’s revenues from its execution layer were up (+43%) month to month, reaching $6.4M per day, usage of Ethereum’s “Blobspace” showed even more dramatic progress. Blobspace, Ethereum’s data availability layer, is finally receiving the consistent demand necessary to make it a viable “business” for Ethereum. In November, Ethereum recorded the highest Blobspace monthly fees at around $2.7M. While the number is miniscule next to Ethereum’s execution layer revenue, which was $170M, we think the growth is encouraging. As a reminder, Ethereum created a special “layer” on its blockchain, allowing Ethereum L2 blockchains to post proofs of each chain’s activity. This is necessary because Ethereum L2s are run on a “sequencer” that does not have many of the safety properties of Ethereum. Because L2s do not have a series of validators checking to make sure each is being honest, but instead a sole sequencer, they need to post proofs of transactions to Ethereum. To encourage scaling, Ethereum decided to make a separate layer that allows L2s to post data to prove honest activity on each L2 cheaply. While this decision scales Ethereum by allowing for cheaper L2 transactions, it has been controversial with some investors because it lowers the demand for ETH to utilize Ethereum. Ethereum prices Blobspace similarly to how it prices Blockspace, with the cost of using Ethereum related to “target” demand. Just like Blockspace, if utilization of Ethereum’s Blobspace exceeds the target, the cost to L2s goes up exponentially, with each block increasing by 12.5% per consecutive period of usage exceeding the target. In that sense, the costs to L2s to use Blobspace can increase very quickly. Blobs Posted Have Increased the Limit of 3 Per Block Source: Dune @Hilldobby as of 11/27/2024. However, L2s have been utilizing mechanisms to increase their Blobspace efficiency. L2s now use the entirety of each blob’s data before posting, which decreases the total number of blobs they must post. L2s are also working on methods to further compress their transactions' size, in bytes. For example, the “optimistic” L2s Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism have reduced the data they post per transaction by (-5%), (-37%), and (-67%), respectively, since June 2024. In November, Starknet announced its compression techniques could reduce the amount of data posted by 5x. These choices will result in lower fees paid to Ethereum (revenue from the standpoint of Ethereum and fees from the standpoint of L2s). One class of L2s, called “optimistic” roll-ups, could further increase data-saving by becoming “zero-knowledge” roll-ups. Because L2s are constantly reducing the data they post to Ethereum to counteract the increase in L2 activity, Ethereum Blobspace usage is hovering right around its target. However, with more than 58 L2 roll-ups posting data to Ethereum and that number growing, any meaningful increase in activity may cause Blobspace demand to surpass the target usage. Already, the number of transactions created by major Ethereum L2s has grown (+263%) over the past year alone. If this trend continues, we could see even data posting pressures that will offset L2 countermeasures and lead to much higher prices for Ethereum Blobspace.

Justin Drake Releases New Ethereum Roadmap Though it took some time, the Ethereum community finally prodded the “devs to do something” to spur more positive sentiment for ETH. As previously noted, ETH’s price has underperformed in both absolute and relative terms year to date. In November, one of the most important figures in Ethereum, Justin Drake, asserted a concrete vision for Ethereum that includes specific dates for development releases. Called “Beam Chain,” Drake’s vision is a substantial overhaul for Ethereum. Some of the most important features are: 4-Second Block Production and 12-Second Finality An Ethereum zk Virtual Machine Lowered Staking Requirements Quantum-Computing Resistant Cryptography Reduce Centralization Factors Speeding up block time and finality is important because it enables a quicker feedback loop for Ethereum users. Justin Drake’s new vision is a massive improvement for Ethereum, which currently has block times of 12 seconds and finality of 13 minutes. One of the biggest drawbacks of Ethereum compared to newer blockchains is that performing on-chain activity takes much more time. Ethereum’s new speed will also enable new types of applications and quicker interactions between its L2s and the network. The second point is perhaps the most ambitious and potentially impactful of Drake’s Beam Chain vision. Installing a zk Ethereum Virtual Machine ((EVM)) could increase Ethereum’s throughput by 1000x or more. This is possible because an Ethereum zk Virtual Machine would create very large blocks (one block with many transactions). In a zk EVM environment, validators could build very large blocks and only send a fraction of the block’s data for other validators to confirm. This should also lead to even faster block times while enabling validators to differentiate based on their ability to process large blocks. ETH/BTC Ratio Holds 0.3x Lowered staking requirements are fascinating because they enable decentralization while creating the potential for larger validators to process many more transactions. This would lead to different tiers of validators, with lower-tier ones simply verifying the authenticity of blocks. Meanwhile, Drake’s focus on quantum computer-resistant cryptography and centralization reduction will help make Ethereum viable in the long term. Quantum computers promise to break Ethereum’s cryptography, which protects its entire blockchain, and Drake’s plan will navigate this challenge by implementing new protections. On the second point, Drake intends to create a set of incentives and rules to make the Ethereum block-building ecosystem less concentrated in a few powerful entities. At the time of writing, around 88% of all blocks are built on Ethereum by two entities. Over the long run, these producers can be persuaded by legal or financial incentives to censor transactions. So, it is in Ethereum’s best interest to expand its set of blockbuilders. Perhaps the most important takeaway for ETH investors is that the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum's research and implementation backbone, is now focused on scaling Ethereum’s execution environment. Previously, Ethereum was more focused on scaling its system through L2s. As we previously mentioned, the flaw with that design is that it siphons blockchain activity away from Ethereum’s Mainnet. Activity on L2 reduces the demand for Ethereum users to consume ETH, and part of ETH’s economics (token go up) is driven by these users. Mainnet Fees in ETH (100-Day Moving Average) Besides reducing demand for ETH, activity on L2s remits transaction fees to L2 sequencers. These sequencers are run by L2 teams who must return capital to investors and drive value to their own tokens. Therefore, they are more likely to sell the collected ETH than ETH validators. Most importantly, however, L2 base fees are not burned on L2s as they are on Ethereum. Thus, substantial amounts of value accrual to ETH are lost because there is less buying pressure, more selling pressure, and less burn of ETH supply. While Ethereum’s focus on bringing more activity to its mainnet is promising, the slow rollout of updates in Justin Drake’s roadmap raises some concerns. Upgrading a $400B blockchain understandably takes time, but a quicker pace is crucial to maintain competitiveness. With the proposed changes spanning until 2029, Ethereum risks losing ground to emerging blockchains with superior technology. Moreover, many planned updates rely on existing technologies, making their delayed implementation particularly frustrating for some in the community. Ethereum’s ultimate goal, or ""North Star,"" is to rival Bitcoin as the world’s most important digital asset. Achieving this requires ""ossification"" - a finalized state with immutable economics. The sooner Ethereum reaches this state, the better positioned it will be to outcompete BTC (if that is the goal). Solana Update In November, Solana ( SOL-USD ) produced another stellar month with returns of (+42%), with the SOL token reaching an all-time high of $262. The positive price action was partly driven by the exceptional on-chain trading activity of memecoins. Thus, Solana's revenues and DEX volumes hit monthly all-time highs in November. In fact, Solana’s $177M in revenues generated in November is double the previous high recorded in October 2024 of $74M. The flurry of on-chain activity also translated into record revenue levels for the important Solana MEV project Jito and memecoin application Pump.fun. In November, Jito made $185M in revenues, while Pump.fun earned over $92M in revenues. While Pump.fun takes revenue directly from memecoin trading on its application, Jito earns fees when MEV occurs on validators who run Jito’s software. As a reminder, MEV, or “maximal extracted value,” is the total value generated by arbitrage opportunities resulting from on-chain DEX trading. MEV is similar to high-frequency trading profits as both profits from speculators giving up the “edge” to make trades. Because crypto trading is more inefficient than trading in traditional finance, MEV can take significant shares of a transaction’s value. In many cases, MEV can be 0.1% of a trade’s value and as high as 10%, depending upon the volatility of the asset traded. Jito is an on-chain application that creates a market for entities to bid on MEV rights and remits 95% of market revenues to validators (and their stakers) who run Jito’s software. Due to Solana activity, popular Solana crypto wallet Phantom claimed the #1 spot in the Apple app store category for “free utility apps.” The positive news accelerated for Solana with Robinhood reinstating trading of SOL on Robinhood’s popular trading application. Adding a catalyst for future on-chain trading activity, the popular NFT project Magic Eden announced that its token would be airdropped in December 2024. Meanwhile, many investors are anticipating the official announcement of a U.S. spot ETP for SOL including VanEck who has sponsored an ETP filing. Notable Performers – Cardano’s ADA (+201%), Polkadot’s DOT (+121%) Cardano’s ADA was one of the month's biggest winners (+201%). We attribute Cardano’s rally to off-chain developments and speculation on Cardano’s founder’s role in determining future crypto policy. Initially, ADA’s rally in the wake of Trump’s presidential victory was relatively tepid as it moved (+8%) from November 5th to November 6th. However, Cardano’s ADA took off with gusto following Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson’s announcement on November 9 that he would be working with the US government to formulate crypto policy. As part of his initiative to drive engagement, Charles Hoskinson announced he will open a crypto policy office in Washington, DC. The result was a (+40%) rally on the news in a day. The momentum, led by retail traders, continued when Robinhood decided to relist ADA on November 13. Finally, on November 21, Cardano released an update to its constitution that addressed lingering issues in the community. Some key takeaways include: Cardano’s governance will be conducted on-chain by ADA holders, who can propose and vote on governance actions. Cardano’s treasury will have a spending limit to ensure its long-term sustainability. Cardano will continue important upgrades like post-quantum computing security while remaining decentralized. From the standpoint of on-chain usage statistics, Cardano’s price seems to have been the catalyst of on-chain activity rather than the reverse. Cardano’s TVL surged (+180%) in November as many Cardano project tokens rallied, which fed back to Cardano’s DeFI TVL. The amount of stablecoins hosted on Cardano and daily average DEX volumes also increased significantly in November (+28%) and (+300%) respectively. However, the absolute amount of stablecoins and daily DEX volumes on Cardano remain small, with only $23M and $12.5M, respectively. These figures compare to Ethereum’s, which averages around $100B in stablecoins and $3B in daily DEX turnover. Curiously, despite Cardano’s long tenue, live since 2017, it does not host major stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC on its chain. In fact, each of Cardano’s stablecoins are projects that only deploy to Cardano. While this presents a current pain point for Cardano users, it also represents a catalyst engine for future Cardano growth. Polkadot Announces JAM, DOT (+121%) in November Polkadot has been one of the most frustrating ecosystems in crypto over the past 5 years. Polkadot was launched, with much acclaim, in 2020 and promised to be a technological leap over other smart contract platforms. This is because its sharded design would scale through “para-blockchains,” similar to the concept of Ethereum L2s. One advantage of Polkadot’s system was that these connecting blockchains would be interoperable through Polkadot’s “Relay Chain.” However, technical hick-ups and a snail-like onboarding pace for parachains caused Polkadot’s ecosystem to implode. As Polkadot could not seize many users during the bull market of 2020-2021, projects deployed to Polkadot withered into irrelevance. While “alt-chain” Ethereum competitors such as Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) and Solana reached 90K and 600k daily active addresses by November 2021, Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) averaged 9k daily active addresses in that same month. Polkadot’s lethargic go-to-market strategy persisted through the bear markets of 2022 and 2023. At the time of writing, Polkadot averaged only 8k daily active addresses in the month of November 2024. Against this unencouraging backdrop, Polkadot’s rally in November surprised many market participants. However, Polkadot and projects on its chain have progressed towards a more vibrant ecosystem. Currently, one of the most popular chains hosted on Polkadot is the Mythos Chain, a gaming and entertainment blockchain. Mythos hosts the popular game NFL Rivals, a trading card game similar to NFL Fantasy Football. In mid-November, Mythos announced that it would be launching a similar game in partnership with FIFA. One of Polkadot's most interesting developments came from the recent Sub0 conference, where Gavin Wood gave an update to his vision for Polkadot’s blockchain. Called JAM, Wood intends for a more agile Polkadot architecture that allows off-chain applications and blockchains to utilize Polkadot. Essentially, this will allow Polkadot to offer cloud-like services for projects that want to use permissionless blockchains for data security, resiliency, and decentralization. From investors' standpoint, this will allow Polkadot to compete with projects like Ethereum, Celestia, and other modular stack projects for applications. With JAM, a crypto project can offload its transaction to Polkadot’s execution and data storage layers. So, for example, an application that utilizes another Chain’s infrastructure could off-board components of its processing to Polkadot for cheaper pricing. Polkadot intends to launch this feature, called CoreVM, in 1Q2025. DeFi Blue-Chips Keep Pace: Aave (+42%), Uniswap (+64%), and MakerDAO (+42%) Large-cap DeFi protocols showed strength in November, as Aave ( AAVE-USD ), Uniswap ( UNI-USD ), and Sky (formerly MakerDAO) delivered significant price gains through fundamental activity and broader market catalysts. Compared to average monthly fees from Q1 2023, Uniswap’s, Aave’s, and Sky’s (formerly MakerDAO) November fees are up 120%, 544%, and 736%, respectively. Increases in these protocols’ fees signal healthy growth in DeFi activity. Lending and borrowing activity on Aave surged amid heightened market volatility. Aave’s fees are primarily driven by interest paid by borrowers, a portion of which is collected as protocol revenue (the Reserve Factor). Higher market activity and leverage demand translate directly into increased fee generation for the protocol. Uniswap, on the other hand, generates fees from trading activity on its decentralized exchange, where liquidity providers collect a small percentage of each trade. As Uniswap remains the dominant decentralized exchange in the Ethereum ecosystem, its fee growth reflects a resurgence in Ethereum-based trading volumes. Meanwhile, Sky primarily derives its fees from interest charged on its overcollateralized DAI stablecoin loans, as well as liquidation penalties during periods of market volatility. In other fundamental developments, Aave crossed $30 billion in deposits in November—an achievement noted by Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, would rank it as the 64th largest U.S. bank by deposits if it were a traditional institution. Aave governance also proposed a partnership with Bitcoin-based Spiderchain this month, setting the stage to tap into Bitcoin liquidity through its nascent L2 ecosystem. Sentiment for DeFi more broadly was buoyed by positive market reactions to Trump’s presidential election win, which is perceived as favorable for crypto-friendly policy. On November 6 th , the day after Trump’s election, AAVE and UNI gained 28% and 29%, respectively. Uniswap’s November performance was further bolstered by a landmark U.S. Fifth Circuit Appeals Court decision. The ruling, which declared immutable smart contracts like Tornado Cash’s to be beyond the scope of traditional sanctions, overturned OFAC’s sanctions. Arguably, this strengthens Uniswap’s market position by setting a promising precedent on the legality of autonomous DeFi protocols. The market responded favorably, with Uniswap gaining 25% in market capitalization ($2.68 billion) the day after the announcement. For context, TORN, the native token of Tornado Cash, rose 1000% that day, from a $19M market cap to $187M. The Fifth Circuit’s ruling underscores the importance of credibly immutable infrastructure, vindicating good-faith DeFi builders systematically intimidated for years through regulation by enforcement and debanking.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) surge occured as data indicated continued investor appetite for the digital currency, even at a six-digit price. Notably, data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw a net inflow of over $33 billion . These funds now hold a record $109 billion in assets after six consecutive days of positive inflows. Analysts are optimistic that the coin will continue doing well in the next few years. In separate notes, analysts from Standard Chartered and BitWise predicted that the coin will get to $200,000 in 2025. They both cited strong institutional demand amid falling supplies. Historical data supports the possibility of accelerated growth. For instance, the Dow Jones rose to $10,000 in 2000, then doubled to $20,000 in 2017, and reached $40,000 this year. Similarly, the S&P 500 doubled from 1,000 in mid-2008 to 2,000 in mid-2014 and then took seven years to double again.

With geopolitical tensions likely to increase during the Trump administration, more countries may consider buying Bitcoin. The U.S. could also convert its holdings into strategic assets under the leadership of newly appointed crypto czar David Sacks . Bitcoin price technicals point to more gains Bitcoin price chart | source: crypto.news Popular crypto analysts forecast BTC reaching $200,000, but the long-term chart suggests potential resistance at $122,000. The monthly chart shows that Bitcoin has just completed the formation of a cup and handle pattern. The upper side of this cup was at $68,858. It then formed the handle between March 2024 and November. This cup was about 77% dip. Therefore, if we measure the same distance from its upper side of the cup, it means that the coin will rise to $122,000. This means that it has about 25% upside from the current level to go from the current level. This outlook aligns with Elliot Wave patterns, suggesting the move to $122,000 would be the third wave, followed by a minor fourth-wave pullback and a final breakout to $200,000. Therefore, while Bitcoin price will likely hit $200,000, it could face some volatility or a big pullback when it gets to $122,000.

37292636,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390261,1733495961,SpacePay: The Hot New Altcoin Simplifying Crypto for Everyday Use,"The post SpacePay: The Hot New Altcoin Simplifying Crypto for Everyday Use appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SpacePay (SPY) is an upcoming crypto payment solution. The presale of SPY is all the rage now, owing to the massive relevance of the product. It is on a mission to redefine everyday spending. Cryptocurrencies have long been called the future of money. But that phrase has little meaning now. After all, they are not useful for daily shopping. They are elusive in mainstream retail. Here is how SpacePay changes that. Cryptocurrency as a Day-to-day Currency Digital assets are valuable investments today, thanks to the massive spike in their value over the years. But their role as a day-to-day currency has yet to take off. SpacePay (SPY) aims to redefine this narrative by making crypto payments practical for everyday use. The project turns cryptocurrency into a real currency for daily transactions. A future where crypto is used for everything from paying for groceries to grabbing lunch is the vision. The ambition has resonated with investors, as the SPY token presale numbers show. The public recently smashed the $500,000 milestone, following an earlier private presale that raised $750,000. It stands out from the crowd of coins that overpromise and underdeliver, with eyes set on its goals. In a market where investors have to wait months, if not years, to see the project roll-out, SpacePay’s Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is already in beta. And here is a quick look at the other accomplishments. SpacePay has taken concrete steps to achieve its goals. For example, SpacePay has reinvested in its own growth and long-term development through a buy-back program. It demonstrates the team’s commitment to creating a functional payment system. Regulatory compliance strengthens SpacePay’s credibility. The project’s efforts haven’t gone unnoticed. It was honored with the title ‘New Payment Platform of the Year’ for 2022–2023 by the CorporateLiveWire Global Awards. No Expensive Hardware or Complex Integrations Simplicity is a core feature of SpacePay. While most payment solutions require expensive hardware or complex integrations, SpacePay works with existing Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. The Android-compatible APK allows retailers to accept crypto payments without any upfront costs or new equipment. For shoppers, the platform is free to use, while businesses pay a low transaction fee of just 0.5%. Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology and QR codes make transactions fast and secure. SpacePay is appealing to businesses that want to integrate crypto without making a mess of their current operations. Fighting Crypto’s Biggest Enemy: Volatility Crypto adoption is difficult because of price volatility. Business owners don’t want their profits to drop overnight because of a sudden crypto crash. That is not a wise way to run a business. How does SpacePay solve this monstrous problem? The application converts crypto payments into local fiat currencies instantly, removing the financial risk for retailers. SpacePay accepts over 325 wallets and multiple cryptocurrencies. But businesses receive payments in their preferred fiat. Thanks to instant settlement on SpacePay, crypto could develop an edge over traditional payment methods as it grows popular. The Next Altcoin Giant? SpacePay’s presale numbers reflect the growing interest in the project. It is also steadily building its user base. The Telegram community has swelled to over 5,000 members, and its X (Twitter) following is nearing 60,000. Beyond potential price appreciation, SPY holders gain access to exclusive perks: Early access to products Voting rights on project decisions. Quarterly webinars with the leadership team. Access to a potential revenue-sharing model. The ongoing SPY token presale is easy to join. It accepts ETH, USDC, USDT, and fiat cards. Early investors enjoy the best prices, as the token value increases with each presale stage. SpacePay’s commitment to real-world utility makes it stand out. While most crypto projects thrive on hype, SpacePay aims to bridge the gap between the crypto world and everyday life. Hype is a great tool to pump up a token. But what makes investors stay is utility and market relevance. That’s where SpacePay shines. After the presale ends, SPY will make its debut on major crypto exchanges. With another crypto bull run coming, It wouldn’t be surprising to see the new crypto coin make top crypto lists in early 2025.

Shiba Inu has had one hell of a week. The second-largest meme coin by market cap started the week on the back of a December 1 price upswing.However, it corrected slightly after the Sunday rejection before retesting the nine-month resistance at $0.00003300 . Meanwhile, a second rejection from the supply zone has seen it drop 11.2% to the current market price.Amid a broader market correction, an analyst has pointed out that Shiba Inu’s chart still looks as bullish as ever. A recent analysis shows that the recent Shiba Inu price movement has seen it filling up a bullish pattern, with a breakout drawing closer.Shiba Inu Pattern Filling UpAnalyst Shib Knight drew his audience’s attention to the latest Shiba Inu price chart development. In a tweet today, he stated that the meme coin is filling up a bullish price pattern, implying an imminent breakout.His commentary shows that the SHIB/USDT chart forms an ascending triangle, with the pattern getting tighter at the tip. While acknowledging that the meme coin is slowly filling the pattern, he predicted where an outbreak would take SHIB. Per Shib Knight, Shiba Inu will surge 28.92% to $0.000040.

Today, the analyst shared a chart showing that a breakout is on course for the leading meme coin.Per the 1-week chart, Shiba Inu is at the peak of a multi-month descending triangle. The price pattern dates back to its all-time high in 2021, with an imminent outbreak targeting substantial upsides.The analyst speculated that if Shiba Inu breaks the resistance at $0.000033, it will fly as high as $0.00007593.

At this point, while Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve promise is supported by many, former New York FED President Bill Dudley said that if the US included Bitcoin in its national reserves, it could harm the interests of the public and change the dollar's status as the global reserve currency. According to Bloomberg, the former NY Fed chairman argued that the Bitcoin reserve would not benefit most Americans and would protect the interests of certain groups rather than the interests of the majority of Americans. Bill Dudley stated that Bitcoin is a weak asset and said that reasons such as price volatility, lack of widespread acceptance as payment, and slow and expensive transaction process make BTC a weak asset. Dudley also noted the risk of individuals losing access to their Bitcoin holdings and that, unlike traditional financial assets, Bitcoin does not generate income through interest or dividends. Dudley argued that creating a Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. would require the Treasury to increase borrowing, raising debt servicing costs or requiring the Fed to print more money, ultimately fueling inflation. Dudley ultimately suggested that instead of creating such a reserve, the incoming Trump and his administration focus on developing comprehensive regulations to support the safe growth of the crypto industry. *This is not investment advice.

37292546,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104177,1733495756,Czech Republic Exempts Bitcoin Held for Over 3 Years From Capital Gain Tax,"Czech Republic introduces a major law relating to crypto taxation by abolishing the capital gain tax on Bitcoin held for more than three years. The Czech Republic Parliament unanimously approved the new regulation today, exempting Bitcoin held for at least three years from capital gain tax. It is worth noting that the recent decision mirrors the country’s taxation on traditional financial instruments, like stocks. Czech Capital Gain Tax on Bitcoin For context, the country’s tax policy on Bitcoin comes in the form of a flat rate of 15% for individuals and 19% for businesses. However, the government applies a 23% standard rate on transactions exceeding a statutory limit of 1,935,552 CZK ($81,579). With the recently approved regulation, if an investor holds Bitcoin for less than three years, the investment will still be subject to capital gain tax. However, Bitcoin held for three years and above is now exempt from this tax, regardless of whether it exceeds the statutory limit. Several crypto stakeholders have commended the recent decision, as it encourages long-term investments in Bitcoin.Following the decision, the Czech Republic has become the latest country to review its tax policy on cryptocurrencies. Last month, Italy made a significant move regarding crypto taxation by reducing its proposed capital gain tax on crypto transactions to 28% from 42%.Czech Parliament Passes 2 Other Crypto Laws Meanwhile, the Czech Republic Parliament also passed two new laws relating to cryptocurrencies. The parliament granted crypto-related businesses the right to legally own bank accounts. Interestingly, the law now prohibits banks from unjustly closing accounts owned by crypto firms without solid reason. This move allows crypto businesses to thrive while maintaining a stable relationship with traditional financial institutions. Lastly, the parliament provided legal clarity on the EU’s Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations. The MiCA regulation has gained momentum in recent times, with several crypto businesses taking stringent actions to comply with the directive. As reported earlier, San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase discontinued its Earn Program in Europe as part of efforts to comply with MiCA regulations.As MiCA rules gained momentum, the Czech Republic Parliament provided legal clarity to guide businesses operating within the country.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/06/czech-republic-exempts-bitcoin-held-for-over-3-years-from-capital-gain-tax/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=czech-republic-exempts-bitcoin-held-for-over-3-years-from-capital-gain-tax,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The restrictions come at a time when many coins and tokens are at an all-time high, while Coinbase grows its listings with meme tokens. The inability to trade or transfer has been reported on social media, with no specific explanation from Coinbase. In the past few days, multiple crypto influencers complained of having their account restricted, with no sufficient explanation. Hey @coinbase and @brian_armstrong why am I restricted from my 1.2 million on your “debanked app” ? pic.twitter.com/YWurFe6E3k — Bullish (@TheBullishTradR) December 5, 2024 The restriction has also affected already verified long-term users and high-profile crypto influencers. The trend of restricted accounts has pushed users to move to Kraken, Crypto.com, Binance, and Bybit for multiple tasks from cashing out to trading memes. Some of the recent account suspensions also included restricted access to assets or transfers. In the past, Coinbase has also flagged accounts for suspicious transactions, leading to weeks-long delays on new fund transfers. In some cases, access to crypto coins and tokens may take months, incurring potential losses. Coinbase retains strict KYC and regional restrictions Coinbase itself has a full KYC screening and proof of identity while limiting some jurisdictions. However, users are reporting frozen accounts after an initial period of trading and usage. The exchange has exhaustive rules on restrictions and can change both trading limits or outright ban users from accessing their accounts. Coinbase may also have confidential internal rules for flagging accounts, with no obligation to share their rationale with the end users. The terms of service do not explicitly mention VPN usage, and some users even claim they have no troubles with specific types of VPNs. What is against the terms, however, is using VPN to connect from restricted regions, or trying to create multiple accounts. The Terms of Service suggest Coinbase does not even have to provide a rationale for restricting accounts, but must give a two-month notice in those cases. The recent wave of suspensions arrived with no explanation and did not issue the two-month warning. Once an account is suspended, the users may only have a 90-day grace period to access and remove any tokens or coins in their balance. VPN users may be flagged Accounts may be flagged for using VPN – which may be intended to hide the origin of funds and the real location of the user. Scott Shapiro , product director of Coinbase, warned that VPN usage may be mistaken for an attack and flagged. Coinbase algorithms trigger VPN alerts and flag the accounts suspected of exploits or potential money laundering. Once restricted or flagged, account recovery may take months, especially during times of slow customer service. Coinbase has also repeatedly demanded credentials from users refusing to complete their KYC profile. In the past week, flagging continued even for customers who did not use VPN. The accounts were also flagged during peak market activity, thus restricting some users from realizing gains. In addition to VPN, some types of apps or ad blockers may also trigger the Coinbase flagging mechanism. Some users have faced a full account freeze, while others only had a restriction on the ability to send funds. The approach of Coinbase is to restrict traffic coming from known VPN servers, so there may still be users that are not flagged. Since Coinbase is a publicly traded corporation, it faces significant restrictions on its allowed customer base. Despite this, VPN remains widely used in crypto trading, even on the side of US-based users, accessing services that exclude the USA. Crypto users often add VPN as an additional layer of confidentiality. The decision of Coinbase to restrict VPN usage led to a renewal of the #deleteCoinbase hashtag, a trend that has re-emerged multiple times on social media. Coinbase retains its top reliability score , despite the recent social media trend seeking alternative markets. While Coinbase retains its rights to act against any suspicious accounts, the bull market enthusiasm is making the situation more difficult for long-term traders, or those that are in fact compliant.

The company is offering tailored services such as sales consultations, real-time monitoring tools, and maintenance solutions. BitFuFu focuses on providing customized solutions that address large-scale mining needs. The company also plans to introduce firmware solutions and other tools designed to optimize mining efficiency. The company’s launch of the pool comes amid rising demand for more efficient Bitcoin mining services. BitFuFu mined 84 BTC from self-mining operations in November 2024 with a total of 2.4EH/s in mining capacity, according to a recent report . The company disclosed that it currently holds 1,664 BTC as part of its disciplined treasury management strategy. It combines Bitcoin accumulation through mining and generating revenue from cloud mining services. BitFuFu’s timing aligns with increased activity in the market, as Bitcoin recently experienced a sharp price fluctuation. After surpassing $100,000, Bitcoin’s price faced a sudden drop by 4.81% in the past 24 hours, trading at $98,106 at press time. This resulted in $649 million in liquidations across the crypto sector, with Bitcoin alone accounting for $216.95 million.

The acquisition aligns with BitFuFu’s efforts to counter soaring operational costs, which have surged by 170% in the past year. In the global Bitcoin mining sector, average energy costs typically range between $0.05 to $0.08 per kilowatt-hour, with some regions exceeding $0.10. With energy prices in Ethiopia averaging below $0.04 per kilowatt-hour, the company expects to lower its Bitcoin production costs. BitFuFu’s comprehensive approach reflects a growing trend in the industry toward consolidation and specialized services. Along with launching its Bitcoin mining pool and expanding into Ethiopia, BitFuFu has seen impressive financial growth.

37292257,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390249,1733495148,"Ahead of the Yearly Close Here Are Targets for BTC, ETH, and XRP & the Top 10 Cryptos for Q1 2025","The post Ahead of the Yearly Close Here Are Targets for BTC, ETH, and XRP & the Top 10 Cryptos for Q1 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The final quarter, specifically the last few weeks of the year, has historically been extremely bullish for Bitcoin and the entire crypto market. The BTC price remained incremental but intensified its bullish action in November. As a result, the bulls jumped in action, triggering the primitive tokens within the top 10, which remained sluggish for a pretty long time. However, these tokens have woken up after a pretty long consolidation and hence, after a bullish close for the year, they could find fresh ATH in Q1 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is tightly consolidating below the resistance zone between $99,273 and $98,577 after facing a small pullback each time after surpassing the levels. However, the technicals remain bullish, with the RSI sticking to the upper threshold. Besides, the MACD is bearish while the selling volume is lower than expected. Therefore, once the upward pressure eases, the BTC price is expected to revamp a strong rise and mark highs around $135,000 in Q1 2025. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum closely follows the star token but the bulls seem to have exerted more pressure on the second-largest token. The price has been consistently rising without leaving any scope for a horizontal consolidation. Besides, the volume has also surged to a large extent, suggesting a notable rise in trading activity. However, $4000 remains the prime range to achieve, after which the bulls could push the price towards a new ATH above $5000, peaking the bull run above $7000 in the coming quarter. Ripple (XRP) After trading within a tight consolidation phase for over 24 months, the XRP price broke out of the range. The speculated closure to the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit in favour of the company is expected to be a major catalyst, along with another couple of them. The selling pressure has compressed the price and hence it is expected to ease off very soon. With this, a fresh breakout may push the price beyond the current ATH and mark highs close to $5 in 2025. BinanceCoin (BNB) Ever since the token broke out in 2021, it has been volatile regardless of the volume induced. As a result, the price ranged without excess noise, which prevented unnecessary bearish attention. As a result, the BNB price breached above $700 and is on its way to mark a milestone above $1000. Although bears are vigilant, the bulls could eventually peak the rally around $1370. Cardano (ADA) After the recent 250% rise, the market participants appear to have become slightly sure of the upcoming price action. As the token displayed sluggish behaviour for a long time frame, the bulls are now expected to exert their accumulated strength. Therefore, the ADA price , which reclaimed $1 after a 24-month horizontal consolidation, is expected to test its highs above $3 in the first few weeks of 2025. However, the peak of the ongoing bull run could be around $6.2. Solana (SOL) Solana is among the tokens that have risen from ashes and formed new highs in a very short time frame. The SOL price remained elevated since the start of 2023 and reached the highs a few days ago. Since then, the bulls have held a strong grip over the rally and are defending the support at $225. The consolidation phase is expected to end soon, paving the way for the token to breach $300 shortly. Meanwhile, the peak of the ongoing upswing is expected to be around $550 to $600. Dogecoin (DOGE) The U.S. election results triggered a massive bullish wave across markets, including the DOGE price. The price quickly broke the resistance at $0.15 and led an impressive rise of over 200% to reach above $0.45. Although the bulls are passive, the liquidity flow from the top tokens is expected to initiate a fresh rise in the Dogecoin price that could reach the ATH at $0.73. Meanwhile, the price is expected to surpass the $1 milestone in the first half of Q1 2025 and peak at around $1.47. Tron (TRX) The Tron price recorded the most bullish week, with over 115% gains not seen since the 2021 bull run and formed a new ATH at $0.45. The trend remains extremely bullish and hence the upcoming yearly close is believed to be on a bullish note. With this, the price is expected to keep up the bullish trend and peak the prevailing bull run at around $0.85, refraining from reaching the $1 milestone.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | ETH | XRP,BTC | DOGE | ETH | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ahead-of-the-yearly-close-here-are-targets-for-btc-eth-and-xrp-the-top-10-cryptos-for-q1-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Notably, the country’s parliament has unanimously agreed to exempt Bitcoin held for more than three years from capital gains tax. Bitcoin Now Taxed Like Stocks! One of the new regulations is that Bitcoin will now be taxed like profits from stocks. This means that capital gains from trading in Bitcoin will remain tax-free if the cryptocurrency is held for at least three years. This change could encourage long-term investments in Bitcoin and make the Czech Republic particularly attractive for Bitcoin holders. Secondly, the local bitcoin businesses now have the right to a bank account. Banks can no longer discriminate against them by closing their accounts for no reason. Lastly, there is legal clarity on MiCA regulation, which is a new vast EU-wide crypto regulation . By exempting Bitcoin held for over three years from capital gains tax, the Czech Republic aims to be a leader in the digital age. This bold and forward-thinking policy is designed to appeal to tech-savvy, entrepreneurial youth who are already driving the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Crashes 10%: Did You Miss the Warning Signs? , Could Lead To Increased Participation From Investors The Czech Republic’s exemption of Bitcoin’s holding period could boost the local cryptocurrency market, as it provides a clear incentive for investors to hold onto their Bitcoin for extended periods.

The Czech Republic’s decision reflects a broader recognition of the importance of cryptocurrencies in the global financial landscape and the need for regulatory frameworks that support their development.

37292082,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390241,1733494882,Interact with the Blockchain Economy In An Easy Way With SpacePay,"The post Interact with the Blockchain Economy In An Easy Way With SpacePay appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SpacePay is a crypto project removing the current roadblocks to blockchain adoption by making transactions easier. A crypto ecosystem that takes an inclusive approach toward payments, SpacePay has raised upwards of $600k in its presale round, with more and more investors turning up every day. This promise of making blockchain payments part of daily life is a promise we have heard many times. What does SpacePay do differently that’s causing investors to move toward it? Understanding The Blockchain Adoption Issues of Today Since the very first time blockchain technology was revealed, the promise was to revolutionize the global economy. While it has done so to some extent, the technology has not achieved wider adoption yet. The technology itself is costly, with gas fees sometimes even higher than the transactions themselves. Delays in payments are another reason, as some blockchain tech has become outdated. Additionally, the fact that most of the blockchain is still beholden to a decentralized system means there is an immense lack of transparency, driving away those who are already sceptical about this technology. SpacePay offers solutions by understanding and acknowledging these shortfalls, and it works to make crypto payments more accessible by addressing each shortfall properly. Addressing Accessibility Through Card Machines Card machines are the mainstay of the modern digital economy. This technology has altered how people use their money as it evolved from accepting just cards to QR codes, making transactions more hands-free. Those codes are the basis of how SpacePay works, allowing people to buy products by spending money from their crypto wallets. SpacePay, which is interoperable with over 325 wallets, will allow users to use these QR codes and spend their crypto. This approach has a two-pronged benefit: one for the customer and another for the merchant. Customers will have an easy time spending their crypto using a familiar solution, a fact that could push more people to integrate crypto into their daily lives. Merchants, on the other hand, will be able to adopt crypto solutions easily and engage with more customers while getting faster settlements. SpacePay also comes equipped with volatility protection, ensuring that merchants are paid the appropriate amount if a crypto price changes during transactions. For instance, if a customer spends 2 SOL to buy a product, and SOL is valued at $200 before the transaction and $100 during it, SpacePay would transfer 4 SOL instead to ensure that the payment matches the agreed-upon price. Addressing Cost Issues By Providing Decentralized and Scalable Solutions SpacePay tackles the cost and centralization issues by providing a decentralized and scalable solution. Each transaction will only have a 0.5% transaction fee. Furthermore, users won’t have to pay extra, and payment companies won’t have to pay any integration costs. Being a terminal-agnostic solution, SpacePay can easily be integrated with most known payment applications. This approach will expand its adoption rate, and people won’t be too intimidated by what SpacePay has to offer. SPY Token – Offering Additional Benefits At the heart of SpacePay lies the SPY token. An ERC-20 asset, this crypto is the key to generating more gains from the SpacePay ecosystem. Not only will it allow investors to get a share of the revenue that SpacePay generates, but it will also give voting power, early access features, and loyalty airdrops. The token will also play a role in giving users voting power, allowing them to have a say in the direction SpacePay’s growth takes. Charitable donations will also be made, and quarterly webinars will be held to keep SPY speakers informed of developments in a more upfront manner. Furthermore, SpacePay has recently announced that staking is coming, which will make it an even more viable investment for long-term traders. SpacePay Presale a Success – Over $600K Raised The combined impact of an inclusive payment solution and broader market conditions has allowed SpacePay to become a front-running asset in today’s crypto market. Over $600k has been raised by the project so far, with more investors turning up every day. What does this say about the SPY price in the future? If we compare it with existing payment solutions, SpacePay appears to be the most aware of the public’s needs. Its ability to venture into the familiar territory of card machines shows it is trying to tackle accessibility issues first, while offering transparency and decentralized solutions can transform it into one of the best cryptos on the market. To participate in such a high-potential project, we recommend taking the following steps to get started: Visit the official website – presale.spacepay.co.uk Connect your wallet Enter the number of USDC, USDT, or ETH to swap for SPY token Confirm the transaction It is also a good idea to keep tabs on more updates coming from SpacePay by following social media accounts.

Aerodrome ( AERO ) price rose to a high of $1.9446 on Dec. 6, its highest level since April 24. According to DeFi Llama , the decentralized exchange network processed coins worth $7 billion in the past 30 days. Its 24-hour trading volume was $1.46 billion, while cumulative volume stands at $81.18 billion. This volume positions Aerodrome as the leading DEX protocol on the Base Blockchain. Its weekly volume also surpasses the Base versions of Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Aerodrome Finance has seen its total value locked increase in recent weeks amid rising cryptocurrency demand. The platform’s TVL currenly exceeds $1.64 billion , ranking it among the top players in decentralized finance Data shows that the network is seeing strong fees too. In a post on Dec. 5, the developers said that its Slipstream product generated a record $950,000 in fees, a trend that may continue. https://twitter.com/AerodromeFi/status/1864716424478073174 AERO’s price gains are bolstered by data showing strong interest from smart money investors. According to Nansen, 45 smart money wallets hold the token, marking an all-time high. These investors collectively own nearly 14 million tokens valued at $26.6 million. Smart money investors are buying AERO | Source: Nansen AERO is gaining traction due to the expanding Base Blockchain ecosystem.

It broke above the significant blue trendline connecting the highest swings since July 18. Moving above that level was an important one as it invalidated the rising wedge pattern that was forming. A wedge is a risky pattern formed when two trendlines are rising and converging. AERO remains above the 50-day and 25-day Exponential Moving Averages, indicating that bulls are in control. The Relative Strength Index has climbed to 71, suggesting continued momentum. Therefore, the next point to watch will be at $2.3727, its highest level in March, which is about 25% above the current level. Conversely, a move below the 25 EMA level at $1.50 will invalidate the bullish view.

As Ethereum consolidates its position near $4,000 and EOS shows volatile movements, a newcomer, Qubetics , is shaking up the scene with its real-world asset tokenisation potential and a presale poised to deliver astronomical returns. Are you missing out on the best cryptos to invest in right now? The crypto world continues to shift. While Ethereum (ETH) has turned a key resistance into support, and EOS rebounds with a 56% weekly surge, Qubetics is redefining investment opportunities with groundbreaking features. Its presale has already raised over $4.4 million in its 11th stage, offering early adopters a chance at life-changing returns. Let’s dive deeper into why $TICS, ETH, and EOS are the hottest names in crypto. Qubetics: Real-World Asset Tokenisation Is the Game Changer Meet Qubetics ($TICS), a blockchain project that’s not just chasing trends but rewriting them. The 11th stage of its presale is creating buzz, with over $4.4 million raised and more than 270 million tokens sold. What sets Qubetics apart is its revolutionary focus on Real-World Asset Tokenisation , a feature poised to disrupt traditional industries. Real-World Impact of Tokenisation Imagine businesses being able to digitise their assets—whether it’s real estate, intellectual property, or even inventory. With Qubetics, professionals can fractionally own these tokenised assets, creating liquidity in previously illiquid markets. For instance, a startup could tokenize its equity, allowing micro-investors to participate without needing large sums of capital. Similarly, property developers could tokenize luxury condos, making high-value real estate accessible to average investors. This innovation doesn’t just add convenience; it breaks down barriers, fostering inclusivity and enhancing financial accessibility. As Qubetics prepares for its mainnet launch, the potential applications are endless, making it a solid contender among the best cryptos to invest in right now. The Numbers Speak Volumes Currently, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0282 in stage 11, with a 10% price hike expected in stage 12 starting December 8. Analysts predict that $TICS could hit $0.25 at the presale end, offering a 786% ROI. If the price reaches $15 post-mainnet launch, early investors stand to gain a staggering 53,091% ROI. A $4,500 investment today could grow to $240,000 if $TICS hits $1 and to a jaw-dropping $675,000 at $15. Qubetics doesn’t just promise returns—it delivers transformative solutions. Its robust architecture, featuring Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and gasless transactions, further enhances its appeal. Ethereum: A Bullish Setup Points to $4,094 and Beyond Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is on the verge of a critical breakout. ETH recently bounced off a key downtrend line on December 3, flipping resistance into support. This movement signals strength, with analysts predicting a potential rally to $4,094. ETH’s uptrend is supported by a robust daily chart: rising moving averages and an RSI near the overbought zone hint at bullish momentum. However, caution remains. A drop below the 20-day EMA of $3,436 could derail this optimism, pushing prices toward the 50-day SMA at $2,991. For now, Ethereum’s resilient fundamentals make it one of the best cryptos to invest in right now, especially for those seeking long-term growth as it powers decentralised finance and NFTs. EOS: Reclaiming its Mojo but Still Far From its Glory Days EOS, often called the “Ethereum killer,” has had a rollercoaster week. After a massive 56% gain over the past seven days, EOS slipped 10% on December 4, settling at $1.27. While this dip spooked short-term traders, it’s worth noting that the token’s trading volume hit $1.66 billion in 24 hours, a testament to its renewed market interest. Despite these gains, EOS remains a shadow of its former self, down a staggering 94% from its all-time high of $22.98 in April 2018. With a current market cap of $1.97 billion, EOS is gradually regaining momentum, thanks to its robust infrastructure for decentralised applications. Still, it’s not the shining beacon it once was, leaving room for innovative projects like Qubetics to fill the void as one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. Why Qubetics Stands Out While Ethereum and EOS have laid the groundwork for blockchain innovation, Qubetics offers a fresh perspective. Its real-world asset tokenisation opens doors for businesses and individuals alike, making blockchain adoption more practical and impactful. For those looking to ride the next big wave in crypto, Qubetics as top crypto presale presents an unparalleled opportunity. Conclusion: Seize the Moment The crypto world is full of opportunities, but not all are created equal. Ethereum and EOS have proven their resilience, but Qubetics is redefining what’s possible in blockchain technology. With its presale in full swing, now’s the time to take action and explore why $TICS is among the best cryptos to invest in right now.

37291958,https://blockworks.co/news/standard-bitcoin-bull-market-cycle,1733494481,Why the bull run so far has been standard,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Happy Friday! The bitcoin blues are real today, though We’ve been told by many a bull that there’s still a few weeks left in December to hit another new all-time high. We’ll just have to see if that pans out. Keep calm and carry on, as the UK government once advised. We think it’s pretty relevant right now. Anyway, this morning, we’re diving into this cycle and why it’s really not that different from past cycles (sorry, y’all) and a lot of people have thoughts on AI agents and where they go from here. See you bright and early Monday. This time is no different It’s always tempting to go against the grain. To believe this time is different. The problem with that is, at least in crypto, everything that is happening today has already played out in the past. Bitcoin bull markets have so far been cyclical and, therefore, even predictable. With the exception of BTC’s all-time high before the halving this time around — rather than around six months after the fact — the current bitcoin bull market is totally par for the course. Those who’ve been reading our emails are familiar with the chart below. It plots our current run (purple) against previous cycles (the others) as if they all started at once. As you can see, this bitcoin bull run to date is entirely standard. Not especially fast, slow or explosive, and more or less in line with the previous bull run. Not shown: bitcoin’s first major run between late 2009 and the second half of 2011 Bull market trajectories have indeed been similar over the years. But there are still emerging trends: 1. BTC is taking longer to reach cycle peaks each time Bitcoin topped about 750 days into its first major bull market cycle between 2011 and 2015. It took 845 days to peak in the following bull market between 2015 and 2018, and more than 1,060 days in the one after, which spanned 2018 and 2022. Today is day 746 of the bull market. If the trend holds, we could see another 10 months to a year before a real peak. 2. Returns are shrinking. Bitcoin went almost 621x in the first run, over 100x in the second and nearly 22x in the third. Extrapolating that downward trend implies BTC would go about 6x from the bottom of the bear to the cycle top. Good news: We’ve already smashed those returns — BTC at $100,000 is 6.7x. Above is the same chart but for altcoins (everything that isn’t bitcoin). We already know that we’re getting closer to a potential fully-fledged altcoin season . What’s interesting is just how far altcoins will need to run to match their growth from the last cycle. The market cap of crypto (excluding bitcoin) had gone 49x by the time it peaked in November 2021. To date, altcoins have done 3.7x at most. It’s reassuring, at least, that it took altcoins more than 1,000 days to peak on the past two occasions. So, if this time truly isn’t different, there’s still plenty of time for alts.

37292657,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317710,1733494462,SEC Expected to Reject Solana Spot ETF Applications,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly preparing to reject applications for spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett. This decision, if confirmed, would mark another setback for the cryptocurrency industry’s efforts to gain mainstream acceptance through regulated investment products. Terrett’s sources, according to her X post from Dec. 6, also indicate that the SEC is unlikely to approve any new crypto ETFs under the current administration. SCOOP: I’ve confirmed that the @SECGov has notified at least two of the five prospective issuers that it will reject their 19b4 filings for the $SOL spot ETFs. The consensus here, I’m told, is that the SEC won’t entertain any new #crypto ETFs under the current administration. — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) December 6, 2024 So far, five asset managers have submitted applications for a spot Solana ETF: VanEck and 21Shares were the first to file in June, followed by Canary Capital in October , then Bitwise in November , and most recently Grayscale in early December . Extract from Grayscale’s 19b-4 filing to list a spot Solana ETF. Source: NYSE SEC’s Cautious Approach to Crypto The SEC’s reluctance to approve Solana ETFs is rooted in its ongoing concerns about the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies. This August, the commission rejected applications from Cboe BZX for two spot Solana ETFs, primarily due to worries about Solana potentially being classified as a security. Under Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has navigated the complex world of crypto assets with a cautious approach, especially regarding investment products linked to assets that might be considered securities. This cautious stance is evident in the SEC’s lawsuits against Binance where Solana’s native token SOL was classified as a security along with nine other cryptocurrencies including Cardano ( ADA) , Polygon ( MATIC ), Filecoin ( FIL ) or Cosmos ( ATOM ). Instead of standing down and pausing crypto litigation with new leadership just weeks away, Gensler's SEC filed an 81-page brief in the Binance case yesterday, recycling the same failed arguments—including the absurd (and unsupported) claim that crypto has no inherent value.… — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) December 5, 2024 In addition, the SEC also filed a lawsuit against Coinbase in June 2023, claiming that 13 tokens offered by this cryptocurrency exchange were securities. The SEC made its most sweeping move against cryptocurrencies to date in February 2023 when it charged Terraform Labs with fraud. This action led to 16 crypto assets being classified as securities. Among those were Terra Luna Classic (LUNC), Terra Classic USD (USTC), Mirror Protocol (MIR), and an estimated 13 Mirrored Assets (mAssets), which were designed to mimic the price of stocks such as Apple and Tesla. Potential Shifts in SEC Policy Despite the setback, the future may not be entirely bleak for spot Solana and other crypto ETFs as well as for the ongoing lawsuits. Gary Gensler will step down on January 20 , with Paul Atkins nominated as his successor. This transition has sparked speculation about potential changes in the SEC’s approach to crypto ETFs, especially given Atkins’ reputation for being more open to digital assets. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, expressed his approval of Paul Atkins’ nomination to lead the SEC. He stated that Atkins’ leadership would bring a much-needed dose of common sense to the agency. Garlinghouse also added that, along with Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, it was time to swiftly and definitively end the current restrictive era on crypto, ”restoring freedom of choice, economic growth, and innovation.” An outstanding choice – Paul Atkins at the helm of the SEC will bring common sense back to the agency. Along with Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, it’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto, restoring freedom of choice, economic growth, and innovation. https://t.co/w8Rqrnubyj — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 4, 2024 However, Atkins’ appointment requires Senate confirmation and any major policy shifts are likely to be a tangled web of negotiation and compromise.

XRP is climbing toward significant highs, while tokens like TRX and ADA continue to gain momentum. In this bullish wave, attention is turning to low-cap gems with massive potential for substantial returns, attracting savvy investors looking beyond the mainstream. Among these emerging tokens is XYZVerse (XYZ) , a pioneering memecoin that unites fans of various sports within a unique ecosystem. Dominate the Field with XYZ: The Next Meme Coin Champion! The game is on, and XYZ is leading the charge in the meme coin arena! This sensational all-sports meme token has hit the market with unstoppable momentum, knocking out weak competitors and scammy cryptos. As it charges ahead, XYZ is set to deliver jaw-dropping gains, leaving the likes of BOME and WIF far behind. With eyes on a staggering 14,900% growth , XYZ is ready to claim the meme coin crown in the next crypto bull marathon! Rule The Game, Cash In As The Bets Roll In XYZ is the star player in XYZVerse – the ultimate fusion of sports thrill and meme culture.

With millions of sports bettors getting ready to jump in the action, opportunities for early investors in XYZ are really huge! XYZ is currently undervalued , and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! XRP (XRP) XRP is currently trading between $1.60 and $2.67. The bulls appear to be weakening as the price nears the resistance level at $3. The Relative Strength Index is at 47.33, indicating a neutral market stance. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.61, slightly above the 100-day average of $2.35, hinting at a modest upward trend in the short term. If XRP breaks through the $3 resistance, it could climb toward the next resistance at $4, marking a notable percentage increase from current prices. Over the past week, the price has risen by 83.63%, and over the past month, it has surged by 411.46%. These significant gains suggest strong momentum that might continue. However, if sellers gain control, the price could drop to the support level at $0.91. TRON (TRX) TRON’s price is currently between $0.19 and $0.22, showing significant growth in recent weeks. Over the past week, the price has surged by over 80%, and in the past month, it has more than doubled. This upward movement suggests that bulls are gaining strength. The Relative Strength Index is around 52, indicating a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment. The nearest resistance level is at $0.23. If TRON breaks above this point, it could aim for the next resistance at $0.26, representing a potential increase of about 18%. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence is positive, supporting the bullish outlook. With the stochastic value low, there may be room for further upward movement. Traders are watching the 100-day simple moving average at $0.25 as a key level. A move above this could signal continued growth for TRON. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has been showing interesting movements lately. Its current price ranges between $0.96 and $1.25. The bulls seem to be gaining strength, with a weekly price increase of over 25%. The 1-month price change is an impressive 261%, indicating strong upward momentum. The 10-day simple moving average is slightly above the 100-day average, suggesting a positive short-term trend. The nearest resistance level is at $1.35. If ADA manages to break through this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $1.64. This would represent a potential gain of around 30% from the current upper price range. The Relative Strength Index is below the overbought threshold, implying there might be room for more growth. With the stochastic indicator showing room for movement and the MACD level slightly negative, some consolidation may occur before the next upward move. Investors are watching closely, as the altcoin season could push ADA to new heights. Conclusion XRP, TRX, and ADA are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin blending sports enthusiasm and meme culture, is drawing investors with its ambitious growth goals.

37291857,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373739,1733494418,"Bitcoin Makes History, Trump Selects New SEC Chair, Mt. Gox Moves Billions: This Week’s Crypto Recap","To say that the past seven days were exciting would be an understatement. According to CoinGecko, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization increased by almost $300 billion and peaked at around $3.8 trillion. This comes on the back of a historic milestone for Bitcoin and the strong performance of many altcoins, so let’s dive into the price action. All eyes were turned on Bitcoin this week. To be completely honest, the price action was relatively dull and rather depressing for the first part of the week. BTC was chopping between $98,000 and $96,000, even dropping to a low below $94,000 at one point. The bulls weren’t active. This all changed on Wednesday when the price shot up toward $99,000. Most of the community were convinced that the price would once again be stopped there, but the buyers had something else in mind. On Thursday morning (Central European Time), the price exploded above $100,000 for the first time in history, thus completing one of the most iconic milestones in Bitcoin’s history. And it didn’t stop there, either. It charted a new all-time high at around $104,000, but that’s where the sellers stepped in, picking up a huge amount of overleveraged long positions and causing a massive drawdown extended all the way to $92,000 (on Bitstamp). Yes, that’s what hundreds of millions of overleveraged long positions can cause to the price when there’s significant selling pressure. Fortunately, Bitcoin recovered and is currently found at around $98,000. As we mentioned, though, it wasn’t just BTC that was soaring. The best performer from the top 10 is undoubtedly Ripple’s XRP. The cryptocurrency exploded by as much as 60% at one point but has since retraced a little bit and is currently trading at $2.30. Ethereum is also up by about 7.6%, Binance Coin (BNB) is up by 8.5%, ADA – by 8%, and so forth. Bitcoin’s rally above $100K came on the back of a major announcement from President-elect Donald Trump. He has made his pick for the new Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and it’s former commissioner Paul Atkins. In the words of Trump himself, Atkins is well-known for his balanced and understanding approach toward digital assets and innovations. With that said, it’s very interesting to monitor the crypto markets in the coming weeks. Will Bitcoin reclaim its high of $104,000 or is a deeper correction in the making? We will have to wait and see.

This Monday, MicroStrategy bought another 15,400 BTC for around $1.5 billion at an average price of $95,976 per coin. This brings its total Bitcoin stack to 402,100 or roughly 1.9% of the entire supply. MARA Closes $850M Convertible Note Offering to Boost Bitcoin Holdings. MARA Holdings, the largest Bitcoin miner that’s also publicly trading on Wall Street, has successfully closed a second offering of $850 million worth of convertible senior notes. The goal of this raise is to boost the firm’s Bitcoin holdings. Fed Chair Likens Bitcoin to Gold, Says It’s Not a Rival to the Dollar.

37291833,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390222,1733494313,Why is Shiba Inu not Breaking the Current ATH?,"The post Why is Shiba Inu not Breaking the Current ATH? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News One of the most famous dog themed meme coin Shiba Inu is finding it hard to cross a major resistance. Once it is passed, the memecoin will be one step away from creating a new all time high. Even though the indicators are looking bullish, why SHIB is unable to cross this line, let’s try to find out. What Does the Chart Say? The daily chart for Shiba Inu shows that RSI is standing at 61.97 and it is in a downtrend. This implies the bullish strength is reducing over time. However the Average Directional Index is on the rise. There are chances that the memecoin is taking a rest and gathering energy for a powerful market momentum. Comparing the price movement for the last few days with the movement of RSI, we can see a diversion. The price was moving up when the RSI was moving down. This shows the memecoin has been overbought by the community. In such a case there are two scenarios : either the asset takes a downturn or stays in a consolidation zone till it matches the RSI movement. SHIB is currently trading at $0.00003021 after facing rejection from a major resistance at fib level 0.618 at $0.00003429. On a weekly chart, this zone is crossed by a trendline since the 2021 bull run that also plays as a resistance here. The Momentum The memecoin is down by 5.50% from its last day price and the trading volume is witnessing a huge reduction. It is down by 53.56%. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 72% of the SHIB investors are still in profit with 19% in loss and 9% at the break even price. At this price over 120k wallets have purchased a total of 37.27 trillion Shiba Inu tokens. The total value locked in Shibarium has increased from $5.57 million on December 2 to $5.82 million today. The SHIB burn rate is up by 208.51% as compared to the last 24 hours means the transactions are rising which is a good sign for growth. As SHIB will have more transactions, the burn rate will increase. A major boosting news for the SHIB army is the upcoming launch of two new projects – TREAT and SHIFU. These two projects are supposed to support the shiba ecosystem and push for more adoption. What To Expect? With continuous token burn, the supply is getting removed from the market, supporting the price. Less supply, more demand increases the price of any asset. Also the launch of two new projects will definitely encourage more investors to join the ecosystem. As the price cools off after staying in a confined zone for sometime, there are high chances it will break past the resistance to fight the final one which is its current all time high. As the community keeps pushing the price with their engagement in transactions, there are high chances we see Shiba Inu marking a new ATH before the year end.",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-shiba-inu-not-breaking-the-current-ath/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37291797,https://crypto.news/?p=14316886,1733494270,"DTX Exchange bound for rally, draws in Cardano and Hedera holders","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DTX Exchange is rapidly gaining attention in the bull market, drawing investors from established altcoins like Cardano and Hedera. Table of Contents DTX Exchange: Crypto trading with 120,000 asset options and no-KYC privacy Cardano’s bullish surge is driven by whale activity Hedera soars with golden cross and strong market sentiment DTX is set to outpace ADA and HBAR as it dominates the bull market Altcoins like Cardano (ADA) and Hedera (HBAR) have recorded massive gains since the start of November 2024. The tokens are riding high, but investors are flocking to a new crypto. As the cryptocurrency market buzzes, DTX Exchange (DTX) has emerged as a dominant player and is expected to succeed in this bull market. Offering many features and components for profitable crypto trading, DTX Exchange appeals to most investors. Read on to learn why DTX is competing with ADA and HBAR and may outpace them in the long term. DTX Exchange: Crypto trading with 120,000 asset options and no-KYC privacy DTX Exchange is a crypto trading platform that stands out in the current bull market because of its trading strategy. It is different from most exchanges that support only trading services for specific asset classes like commodities, indices, bonds, and stocks. Remarkably, DTX Exchange offers over 120,000 asset options for traders to invest, including cryptos. Offering all these assets means DTX Exchange is connected to the $714.7 trillion OTC derivatives market, giving the new crypto project massive growth potential. The widespread asset coverage makes it easy for investors to handle multiple assets without switching between accounts or platforms. If users are looking for an investment opportunity that does not invade their privacy, DTX Exchange is perfect. Its underlying platform supports a no-KYC policy, meaning users transact without revealing their identity. This strategy helps to meet traders’ needs and is ideal for users who want to enjoy an easy and quick registration process. DTX Exchange dominates the crypto space by offering an advanced investment concept and its token has recorded an impressive market performance, although it is still in its presale phase. On that note, DTX’s presale has raised over $9.5 million and market experts say it will hit $10 million by the end of the week. With all its features, DTX Exchange improves users’ trading experience and offers attractive incentives for its coin holders. The crypto trading platform could become the next big thing in this bull market due to its enhanced privacy, and features, and offers access to many assets. Cardano’s bullish surge is driven by whale activity Cardano has been a strong performer in the crypto sector due to its many developments. Additionally, Cardano’s ADA is performing outstandingly in this bull market as more investors buy because of its impressive long-term prospects. Interestingly, the latest ADA rally is fueled by whale activity, with addresses having 100 million to 1 billion tokens buying $276 million worth of tokens in a week. The aggressive purchase tightened supply considerably. On that note, the Mean Coin Age trend confirmed network accumulation because long-term investors have reduced selling. Cardano’s ADA was valued at $1.21 on December 3, up 27% in the last week. Analysts believe the Cardano token will rise to $1.65 this month as large whales increase their buying activities. Despite the remarkable performance by ADA in the current bull market, investors have turned to a new crypto, DTX, due to its long-term growth prospects. Hedera soars with golden cross and strong market sentiment Hedera’s HBAR token has recorded a massive surge recently, with its price rising consistently since the beginning of December 2024. The HBAR rally followed the formation of a golden cross, described as a bullish technical indicator that develops after the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA. The pattern intensified buying activity, pushing HBAR’s price to a high of $0.387 on December 3, 2024. Other factors, including growing network adoption and an expanding governing council with 32 members, have contributed to HBAR’s bullish momentum. Positive sentiment in the general crypto market has increased interest in HBAR, accounting for its bullish momentum. If the upside momentum continues, the Hedera coin will enhance its position as a leading token in this bull market. On that note, HBAR traded at $0.346 on December 3, 2024, up 151% in the past week. Analysts believe HBAR will surge to $0.395 this month as the bulls dominate the market. DTX is set to outpace ADA and HBAR as it dominates the bull market While Cardano and Hedera have made waves in the current bull market, DTX Exchange is rapidly becoming dominant in the crypto industry. With its advanced strategy, offering over 120,000 asset options, DTX is attracting many investors seeking long-term growth potential. As its presale performs well, the new crypto will outpace established tokens like ADA and HBAR, making it a standout crypto trading investment. DTX is in Stage 6 of its public presale, valued at $0.12. The current price point implies a 6x profit for early investors who bought the token at $0.02. Furthermore, new investors will receive a 100% ROI after the presale token launches on mainstream exchanges at $0.20. To learn more about DTX, visit their website or Telegram community .

Now, 1FUEL (OFT) is being hailed as the next big thing, with market strategists calling its $0.01 presale a golden opportunity. 1FUEL is setting itself apart with its powerful mix of privacy, seamless functionality, and earning potential, positioning itself as a game-changer in the DeFi landscape. Could this be your chance to catch the next Dogecoin-level rocket? Let’s find out. Is the meme king ready to reclaim the throne? South Korea’s crypto market exploded, with trading volumes blowing past its stock market inflows of $385 million. Veteran tokens like Dogecoin are back in the spotlight. Once dismissed as a playful meme coin, DOGE has roared back, posting a staggering $60.8 billion market cap and attracting major whale action with $102 million in transfers. But it’s not just whales circling; Dogecoin’s network is buzzing with record-breaking activity, tallying 9.23 million active addresses. And let’s not overlook November, when DOGE’s transaction volume soared to over $10 billion daily before leveling off to a still-impressive $2.44 billion in December. DOGE technical patterns hint at a rally against Bitcoin, rekindling excitement among retail investors. Could this be the start of another epic Dogecoin run? 1FUEL presale: Is this the next DOGE? If Dogecoin’s meteoric rise proves anything, it’s that the right mix of accessibility, hype, and community power can create life-changing returns. Now, 1FUEL (OFT) is taking that blueprint and upgrading it for the DeFi age. This next-gen crypto wallet is designed to streamline digital asset management. 1FUEL simplifies cross-chain crypto transactions with a single click, making it a game-changer as multi-chain ecosystems become the norm. 1Fuel is building a P2P exchange that lets you trade directly with others without worrying about middlemen or sketchy platforms. Add a privacy mixer and cutting-edge cold storage for crypto, and you’ve got a fortress for your assets. It’s a solution tailor-made for an era where privacy is gold, and scrutiny is the new norm. But it goes beyond a regular exchange: passive income. Combine crypto staking rewards up to 10% APR, and the skyrocketing DeFi adoption, projected to hit $232 billion by 2030, and you’ve got a secure crypto wallet built for the future. What ties it all together is the presale. Early supporters get in at $0.01 with perks like bonuses and exclusive features. With 36% of tokens allocated to presale and a roadmap geared toward development and marketing, it’s clear why 1FUEL’s privacy-focused cryptocurrency is the project market strategists are betting on. The bottom line If you missed out on Dogecoin’s 2021 breakout, here’s your second chance to catch lightning in a bottle. 1FUEL (OFT) brings the same potential for explosive growth but with a DeFi edge that could take it even further with privacy-first tech, one-click cross-chain transactions, and staking rewards that let your investment earn while you hold.

37291630,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623757,1733493879,"Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim declares that Bitcoin has been de-risked, wants to adopt it","Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim wants Bitcoin on the table as a serious contender in the city’s financial strategy. He proposed Vancouver explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset to diversify its financial reserves and protect the city’s purchasing power. His proposal will be reviewed by the Vancouver City Council on December 11. Sim’s motion, “Preserving the City’s Purchasing Power Through Diversification of Financial Reserves – Becoming a Bitcoin Friendly City,” is being pitched as a forward-thinking move in an economy he says is riddled with uncertainty. During a council meeting , Sim made his case loud and clear. He told council members that Bitcoin’s performance over the past 16 years can’t be ignored. “It would be irresponsible for the City of Vancouver to not look at the merits of adding Bitcoin to the City’s strategic assets,” Sim said. The mayor has called Bitcoin “the greatest invention in human history” and suggested that other cities should be paying attention to what Vancouver is trying to do. Bitcoin’s place in Vancouver’s future The proposal focuses on hedging against inflation and ensuring financial resilience. Bitcoin’s limited supply, capped at 21 million coins, gives it an edge over traditional currencies, which can be printed endlessly. Sim argued that Bitcoin offers a unique shield against the erosion of purchasing power in an economy where inflation is a constant threat. The motion is about more than just inflation, though. Diversification is a key element of Sim’s strategy. The mayor wants to reduce Vancouver’s reliance on traditional financial assets, which he says are vulnerable to economic shocks. Not everyone shares Sim’s optimism. The idea of using Bitcoin as a municipal reserve asset has raised eyebrows. Bitcoin’s volatility is one of the most obvious concerns. Its price has seen dramatic swings, including an 80% drop between November 2021 and November 2022. Critics argue that this unpredictability makes it a risky choice for a city’s financial foundation. Another sticking point is Bitcoin’s lack of intrinsic value. Unlike gold, which has been a reliable store of value for centuries, Bitcoin is entirely digital and has no physical backing. Economists have questioned whether Bitcoin can truly be a stable asset in the long term, pointing out that its value is largely speculative and doesn’t have the same industrial or historical backing as gold. Liquidity is another concern. Reserve assets are supposed to be liquid and accessible during emergencies. Bitcoin’s design doesn’t align with this purpose. Its value often depends on long-term holding rather than short-term liquidity. Critics argue that this makes it unsuitable as a financial safety net for municipalities.

This decline has investors worried, and there is concern about whether there will be further declines. At this point, famous Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor said that an 80% collapse in Bitcoin is unlikely. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor addressed his personal Bitcoin purchases in an interview with Yahoo Finance, stating that he does not expect a major crash in the BTC price. Saylor, who admitted that an 80% collapse in Bitcoin is theoretically possible, stated that he believes this will not happen in practice. While Bitcoin has seen pullbacks, Saylor said he does not believe BTC will experience a major correction in 2022 like the previous cycle, when it fell 80% from $66,000 to $16,000. “For a drop like this to happen, there would have to be a bunch of very poorly capitalized companies like FTX, Genesis, Celsius and BlockFi that would go bankrupt. But right now, there are no such companies in the market, and it seems very unlikely that this scenario will happen again,” Saylor said. Saylor also noted that Bitcoin’s high volatility has not hindered his company’s regular BTC purchase strategy, which he funds by issuing MSTR shares. Saylor said that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin-based return has brought in $12.3 billion in profit this year, making MicroStrategy the most profitable, fastest-growing company in the Bitcoin standard. *This is not investment advice.

37293285,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/hawk-eyed-critics-slam-hawk-tuah-girls-meme-coin-meltdown,1733493697,Hawk-Eyed Critics Slam ‘Hawk Tuah’ Girl’s Meme Coin Meltdown,"22-year-old internet sensation known for her viral ""Hawk Tuah"" TikTok video, Haliey Welch, is facing criticism after her memecoin $HAWK crashed 91% post-launch amid allegations of insider trading and poor management. Rapid Rise and Fall of $HAWK Viral internet celebrity Haliey Welch has come under scrutiny following the catastrophic launch of her memecoin, $HAWK , on December 4 via the Solana blockchain. Despite initial success, the coin's value plummeted, raising concerns about insider activities and mismanagement. Shortly after its launch, $HAWK surged to 900% of its original value, reaching a peak market cap of $490 million, according to Crypto Times. However, within hours, its value crashed by 91%, falling to $0.002439 from its Wednesday evening high of $0.04916, per DexScreener. The crash has been attributed to insider wallets and snipers—entities that purchase large volumes of a coin at launch to sell during a peak publicity surge. Blockchain data analyzed by Bubblemaps and DexScreener revealed that 80–90% of $HAWK's supply was controlled by these groups, causing major price instability. Criticism from the Crypto Community Welch's team faced backlash from prominent voices in the crypto space. Stephen Findeisen, a crypto YouTuber known as Coffeezilla, criticized the $HAWK launch during a heated X (formerly Twitter) Spaces conversation, calling it “one of the most miserable, horrible launches I’ve ever seen.” He also accused Welch’s team of insider trading, a claim they denied. In response to the allegations, Welch stated on X that her team had not sold any tokens and had “tried to stop snipers as best we could.” However, the absence of clear evidence of illegality has left the controversy unresolved. From Influencer to Crypto Controversy Since gaining fame for her viral TikTok video, Welch has ventured into various projects, including launching a podcast and an animal charity. Her foray into cryptocurrency, however, marks a controversial chapter in her career. Positioning herself as the “Queen of Memes,” Welch has publicly endorsed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, aligning with her online persona. However, the $HAWK debacle has cast doubt on her ability to manage ventures in the highly volatile crypto market. Legal and Ethical Implications While the launch has raised questions about Welch's role and responsibility, there is no concrete evidence of legal wrongdoing. However, the fallout has sparked broader discussions about the risks of influencer-backed crypto projects and the need for greater oversight in such ventures. The $HAWK crash serves as a cautionary tale for traders and influencers alike, highlighting the volatility and potential pitfalls of the memecoin market.

37291436,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658290,1733493633,"XRP Price Marks $2.13 And $2.92 As Primary Fibonacci Levels, What Happens When Wave 2 Begins?","Technical analysis of the XRP price has revealed the creation of corrective waves in light of the recent correction since December 3. Particularly, the cryptocurrency is now trading between crucial Fibonacci levels that could be correcting for a while longer. With the aid of these Fibonacci levels, crypto analyst Dark Defender shared insights on social media platform X, highlighting the $2.13 and $2.92 price ranges as pivotal for the XRP price. XRP Tests Fibonacci Levels Amid Market Correction According to the XRP chart below, which was first highlighted on social media platform X by crypto analyst Dark Defender, the XRP price rally earlier in the month saw it peaking around $2.92 on crypto exchange Binance, which also aligned with the 261.80% Fibonacci extension level. This impressive high, however, was short-lived as the token faced a correction that brought its price down to a support at $2.17. Notably, this support is also just above the 161.80% Fibonacci extension level at $2.13, which is now a critical point for the XRP price going forward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $100,000: Road To More Gains Or Potential Bull Trap? Analyst Has Answers With this in mind, Dark Defender noted that both $2.92 and $2.17 are the most important price levels to watch right now. The rebound from $2.17 suggests that the correction may be bottoming out, with his analysis pointing to a transition into Wave B in the daily time frame. What To Expect During Wave B Speaking of Wave B, this analysis is based off of a three-corrective-wave pattern. This pattern, comprising three distinct phases, Waves A, B, and C, has played out repeatedly during XRP’s price rally. Within this structure, Waves A and C represent downward trends, while Wave B reflects an upward move. If this corrective model were to repeat itself, the XRP price could experience a climb to $2.92, corresponding to the 261.80% Fibonacci extension level, before another downward trend potentially leads it back to retest support at $2.13, the 161.80% Fibonacci extension level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100,000: Why Reclaiming The $96,400 Level Is Very Important For Another Rally As Dark Defender noted, it might take a couple of days to get rid of this structure. This means that the XRP price could continue to trade between these levels before any decisive move either upwards or downwards. Recent market factors suggest a break to the upside, which would send the XRP price on a resumption of breaking into new multi-year highs. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $2.37, having increased by 2.9% in the past 24 hours. One factor contributing to this optimism is the nomination of Paul Atkins by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the SEC. Atkins is widely regarded as crypto-friendly, and his potential leadership could mark the end of the longstanding SEC-Ripple legal feud. Such a resolution would likely invite significant institutional and retail inflows into the XRP ecosystem.

According to a video by Braiins mining’s Chief of Propaganda, Kristian Csepcsar, the Czech Republic Parliament has unanimously agreed to exempt capital gains tax on Bitcoin ( BTC ) held for more than three years. Previously, capital gains that came from owning Bitcoin was subject to a 21% corporate income tax. Not only that, the parliament has also agreed on a set of new laws that would serve to benefit Bitcoin holders in the long-run. One of the laws passed by parliament includes giving Bitcoin-related businesses the right to open up a bank account. Oftentimes traditional finance institutions would choose not to invest or offer services to crypto firms for fear of losing support, as seen in the U.S. with Operation Chokepoint 2.0 which led to numerous crypto-related banks going bankrupt. “Local Bitcoin businesses have the right to a bank account.

MiCA is a regulatory framework that clarifies and uniformly regulates the cryptocurrency market. It defines digital asset classification and specifies laws and areas of responsibility for their implementation. Crypto and stablecoin firms are expected to fully comply with the new MiCA laws by Dec. 30.

Meanwhile, major firms like BlackRock, MARA Holdings and MicroStrategy are doubling down on Bitcoin accumulation. BlackRock added 7,750 BTC via its ETF and MicroStrategy reported more than $17 billion in unrealized Bitcoin profits after its jump past $100K. Additionally, Trump's nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair attracted a lot of praise from crypto leaders, who see it as a very positive development for the crypto industry. Lawrence Summers Questions Logic of Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Former United States Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers strongly criticized President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Summers even called it “crazy” and a political maneuver that is aimed at pleasing crypto campaign donors. On Bloomberg TV on Dec. 6, Summers dismissed the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve as impractical, and questioned the rationale behind the government holding a ”sterile inventory” of Bitcoin. He also argued that while reserves of commodities like oil and gold actually have historical and practical significance, accumulating Bitcoin lacks a compelling justification. Summers on Bloomberg TV (Source: YouTube ) Summers suggested that the concept is primarily driven by political interests, and stated that this move will serve as a way to pander to wealthy crypto donors. Trump previously suggested that the U.S. government should hold on to the approximately 198,000 BTC it seized , which is worth more than $19 billion. Some Trump-aligned Republicans, including Senator Cynthia Lummis, are also advocating for legislation that will see the government buy and hold 1 million BTC for at least twenty years. U.S. government Bitcoin holdings (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) While Summers dismissed the notion of a Bitcoin reserve, he did acknowledge that some of Trump’s broader comments on crypto regulation have merit. He agreed that financial innovation should be supported and suggested that regulatory overreach may have stifled crypto’s potential. Summers served as Treasury Secretary from 1999 to 2001, and advised crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group in 2016. Supporters of Lummis’ Bitcoin reserve proposal argue it could be a tool to address the nation’s over $36 trillion debt. However, critics like Avik Roy, the president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, warned against overestimating Bitcoin’s role in dealing with fiscal challenges. At a recent crypto summit , Roy stated that while a Bitcoin reserve might have some benefits, it does not address the underlying issue of federal deficits. Major Players Scoop up More Bitcoin The crypto industry certainly has a lot more faith in Bitcoin than Lawrence Summers. Bitcoin-stacking activities surged after major firms and a crypto whale took advantage of the crypto’s recent price drop to $92,957 on Dec. 5. Leading the purchases was BlackRock, which bought 7,750 Bitcoin through its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This brought BlackRock’s total Bitcoin holdings to $46 billion. Thomas Fahrer, the founder of Apollo, even called BlackRock’s ETF the “ fastest growing ETF ever .” Meanwhile, Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings also bought 1,423 Bitcoin worth $139.5 million across multiple transactions. The acquisitions happened after the closing of the company’s second $850 million convertible note offering , which MARA earmarked for Bitcoin accumulation. With these purchases, MARA’s total Bitcoin holdings rose to 22,108 Bitcoin, worth $2.17 billion. This is a 162% increase compared to last month. An anonymous crypto whale also took advantage of the price dip by purchasing 600 Bitcoin worth close to $58.9 million. Blockchain data revealed that the whale’s wallet address became active just a few weeks earlier. Its first transaction was recorded on Nov. 24. Additionally, health-tech firm Semler Scientific joined the Bitcoin-stacking trend, and bought 303 Bitcoin on Dec. 4 at an average price of $96,779. The purchases were made just hours before Bitcoin’s price surpassed the $100,000 mark. This brought Semler’s holdings to 1,873 Bitcoin, valued at $182.8 million. Public firms collectively hold about 527,026 Bitcoin, which is 2.66% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Governments hold 2,856 Bitcoin, while asset management firms and private companies hold 1,253 Bitcoin and 410,418 Bitcoin, respectively. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Profits Soar MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy resulted in over $17 billion in unrealized profits, according to data from MSTR Tracker . Since 2020, the company purchased more than $23 billion worth of Bitcoin under the guidance of founder Michael Saylor. After Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 per coin for the first time on Dec. 4, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings swelled to a value of more than $40 billion. MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: MSTR tracker ) The company’s strategy not only paid off in cryptocurrency gains but also propelled its stock to exceptional heights. MicroStrategy’s shares surged more than 463% year-to-date, outpacing almost every stock in the S&P 500. As of Dec. 5, the company had a market cap of close to $90 billion, which is more than double the value of its Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy share price YTD (Source: Google Finance ) Analysts predict that the stock could continue to grow due to its accelerating Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Benchmark fintech analyst Mark Palmer recently raised his price target for MicroStrategy’s shares from $450 to $650, though the stock currently trades around $386. After its success, MicroStrategy is still committed to its bold approach, and introduced Bitcoin yield as a new performance metric to measure the ratio of Bitcoin holdings to outstanding shares. In October, the company also announced its ambitious “21/21 Plan,” to raise $42 billion through equity and debt to fund a three-year Bitcoin purchasing campaign. Ripple and Coinbase Praise Trump’s SEC Chair Choice Bitcoin could receive an extra price boost after crypto executives in the United States shared their support for President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the SEC. Former SEC commissioner Atkins, who served under President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2008, is considered by many in the crypto industry as a very favorable choice, and could signal a shift away from the enforcement-heavy approach under current SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Bitwise Asset Management general counsel Katherine Dowling called Atkins a “great choice” during a Bloomberg interview , and suggested that he could encourage better collaboration with lawmakers and other regulatory bodies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse welcomed the prospect of Atkins leading the SEC, and stated it will bring ”common sense” back to the agency. Ripple has been at odds with the SEC since a 2020 lawsuit alleged the company used XRP as an unregistered security. Despite a recent $125 million judgment against Ripple, the case is still ongoing. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal also praised Atkins, and described his potential appointment as ”sorely needed” for an agency that has faced criticism for its approach to regulating digital assets. Coinbase is also currently battling an SEC lawsuit over alleged unregistered securities. Atkins has ties to the blockchain advocacy group Digital Chamber as well as crypto industry players, and previously suggested the SEC adopt a more accommodating stance toward digital assets to encourage industry growth in the U.S. If nominated, Atkins will require Senate confirmation, where the slim Republican majority could play a pivotal role in his approval.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6407/lawrence-summers-calls-trump-s-bitcoin-reserve-plan-crazy,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37292545,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104167,1733493510,Experts Say XRP is Going for It Again: Price Levels to Watch,"Experts predict XRP could see another bullish rally, with potential price targets around $3 depending on key support levels and market movements. XRP has been trading within a range for the past few days after dropping from the $2.85 top. Since this seven-year peak, the bears have dominated, pushing the price down to retest the $2.10 level.Despite this, proponents remain hopeful for a fresh bullish rally that could propel the price past its all-time high. Multiple analysts suggest XRP may be nearing the conclusion of its stay in the $2 range. According to ""Altstreet Bet,"" XRP is ""going at it again,"" referencing a chart showing an impending breakout after four days of consolidation. The analyst predicted a giant wave could take XRP back to the $3 price range. XRP chart by Altstreet Bet MichaelXBT, a charting expert, shared a similar viewpoint. He highlighted that XRP is currently retesting a broken channel as support, with the next upward move likely to begin soon.Meanwhile, technical analyst Casi Trades provided a detailed analysis of XRP’s next movement, outlining two potential scenarios for its future price action. First Scenario for XRP Future Price MovementIn the first scenario, known as the ABCDE scenario, Casi suggests that if XRP finds support at the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level (around $2.312), the next wave could propel the price to $3.74.This price target represents the 0.618 extension of the 5th wave, a strong signal of bullish momentum. According to Casi, a breakout above XRP's all-time high (ATH) would likely occur, followed by a test of that support level, paving the way for further gains.Second Scenario for XRPThe second scenario, the ABC path, involves a deeper correction. Specifically, Casi projects that XRP will complete the C wave between the 0.382 retracement levels, with a dip to $1.94–$2.04. For context, XRP is currently trading at $2.29.Should this dip occur, XRP's next move would likely align with the $3.50 price point. A break above this level, coupled with a successful retest of support, would signal the potential for a more massive surge. XRP chart by Casi Casi’s outlook is highly optimistic, suggesting that the ATH run is well within reach and that the bull run up to the current position may just be the beginning of a major upward trend. She emphasized that the crucial price levels between $3.50 and $3.74 will be pivotal in setting the tone for XRP's next major move.According to her, a clean break of the ATH, followed by a support test, would be the ideal scenario for XRP rather than encountering heavy resistance at these key levels.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/06/experts-say-xrp-is-going-for-it-again-price-levels-to-watch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=experts-say-xrp-is-going-for-it-again-price-levels-to-watch,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

(COIN).  Coinbase's hired help, History Associates Inc., had taken the FDIC and the Securities and Exchange Commission to court in June and finally won access to certain internal FDIC communications. The heavily-redacted documents emerged on Friday, showing the banking regulator slamming the brakes on lenders offering or considering products and services in the digital assets sector.  ""We respectfully ask that you pause all crypto asset-related activity,"" the regulator wrote in one of the 23 letters shared by the crypto exchange. ""The FDIC will notify all FDIC-supervised banks at a later date when a determination has been made on the supervisory expectations for engaging in crypto asset-related activity.""  The industry has long complained that it's been under a banking crisis in which companies and leading crypto figures are blocked from U.S. bank services. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal argued that these letters represent hard evidence that crypto businesses were systematically walled off from banking by the regulator.  ""The letters show that this was no conspiracy theory at all, that this was not just rank speculation or the musings of a paranoid industry,"" Grewal said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""There was a concerted plan on the part of the FDIC that they carried out — without any reluctance — to deny banking services to a legal American industry. That should give everyone great pause.""  Read More: Citibank Debanked Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse Due to Crypto, Exec Says  Though much of the text of the FDIC letters is blacked out and the specific institutions aren't identified, the communications dated throughout 2022 make it clear that the various crypto activities bankers submitted for FDIC approval wouldn't be moving forward until the banks could answer questions on how they would meet compliance demands, which didn't yet seem fleshed out. In some cases, the activity was stopped before it started, and in others, the agency seemed to caution against any further expansion or was asking a bank to halt a line of business until the agency could finish reviewing the firm's request.  ""We expect you to satisfactorily address these and any subsequent questions (in advance of implementation) to ensure the bank of operating in a safe and sound manner,"" read a typical example.  Some of the confidential letters included dozens of highly complex and demanding questions posed to the banks. But many of the documents also indicated the agency wasn't yet sure what regulatory filings would even be required before it could green-light crypto business.  While the three primary banking regulators in the U.S. — also including the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — have issued some broad cautionary guidance about crypto, the agencies haven't instituted a formal set of rules regulating the sector.  An FDIC spokesperson declined to comment on the release of the letters on Friday.  Grewal said the next step in federal court will be to request that the letters be cleared of the redactions, revealing the institutions, the services they sought to offer and all the questions they were asked. That will get to the ""why"" behind the FDIC's stance, he said.  ""Even after federal courts ordered the FDIC to produce this information over and over again, they continue to drag their feet, and we think it's time that they stop,"" Grewal said.  The debanking campaign has been known in the industry as Operation Chokepoint 2.0 after a previous government effort to sever controversial but legal businesses from banking. The topic arose again in Congress this week during a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, where crypto business leaders testified that their companies had been cut off from financial services.  ""We've also been debanked,"" said Nathan McCauley, the CEO of Anchorage Digital, a bank federally chartered in the U.S. by the OCC.

37291226,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373720,1733493167,Bitcoin Leaves Exchanges as Retail Demand Surges Despite Profit-Taking,"Bitcoin broke the massive psychological barrier of $100,000 for the first time this week, marking a historic milestone. However, its journey beyond the milestone was brief, as the cryptocurrency experienced a flash crash to below $92,000. The recovery was swift, with Bitcoin currently trading near $98,000. Data from CryptoQuant suggest that the rally is supported by decreasing BTC supply on exchanges and sustained demand, indicating the current uptrend could be sustainable. Bitcoin Outflow From Exchanges According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , there is a significant trend in Bitcoin exchange netflows, signaling potential bullish momentum in the market. Negative flows, indicating more Bitcoin leaving exchanges than entering, have intensified since late October, suggesting that whales are transferring their holdings to long-term storage. This movement reduces the supply of Bitcoin on exchanges, easing selling pressure and creating conditions for price appreciation. The trend aligns with Bitcoin’s recent surge beyond the $100,000 mark, supported by decreasing exchange supply and sustained demand. However, CryptoQuant cautions that as prices approach higher levels, profit-taking could introduce short-term volatility. For long-term investors, the shrinking supply paired with steady demand strengthens the case for further gains. Retail Demand for Bitcoin There has also been a surge in retail investor demand for Bitcoin, with the 30-day demand change reaching its highest level since 2020. CryptoQuant said that this heightened retail interest has boosted ongoing market demand, even as some long-term holders begin taking profits. Historically, increased retail participation has often signaled a potential local top, but it also reflects growing market engagement. Bitcoin’s sideways trading phase suggested that retail demand could taper off gradually, though a breakthrough past the $100,000 level is now expected to reignite enthusiasm and potentially drive a euphoric market phase. “Monitoring the interplay between retail and institutional activity during this phase will be crucial, as strong retail participation often signals heightened market optimism, while institutional interest provides the foundation for sustained momentum.” The post Bitcoin Leaves Exchanges as Retail Demand Surges Despite Profit-Taking appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-leaves-exchanges-as-retail-demand-surge-despite-profit-taking/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37291226.jpeg

Specifically, it was named and inspired by a squirrel of the same name that animal control agents killed in a raid due to wild animal complaints. Given the social media popularity of the squirrel and its owner and the seemingly unjustifiably violent nature of the intervention, it became something of a poster child against regulatory and law enforcement overreach. Peanut’s role was further bolstered due to the political climate ahead of the 2024 presidential election, with some Trump voters practically adopting it as a symbol. One cryptocurrency trader seemingly entered a PNUT position at exactly the right moment – though the unusual size of the meme coin bet certainly raises some questions. The ballad of Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) Specifically, the investor spent 2,717 Solana (SOL) – worth approximately $450,000 – on November 5 to purchase 16 million PNUT. At the time of the original trade, Peanut the Squirrel was changing hands at approximately $0.045. On December 6, the trader finally moved his meme coin to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance in order to cash in on the non-trivial return, estimated at 1,772% by the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain. Indeed, as PNUT is trading at about $1.34 at press time, the fortunate investor turned $450,000 into almost $8 million with a combination – at the very least – of great timing and luck . PNUT 30-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Of bulls, squirrels, and bears Though the Peanut the Squirrel trade is certainly remarkable, it is merely one of the many such meme coin maneuvers executed during the 2024 bull market . For example, early in December, another trader made an even more remarkable investment as they, also in about a month, turned $169 worth of Solana into $435,000 by investing in a Leonardo da Vinci-inspired token called Salvator Mundi (MUNDI). A November 25 FRIC (FRIC) trade was even more incredible as it saw one cryptocurrency market investor turn $6,300 into $1.5 million – a 23,378% return – within just one hour. Still, for all the meme coin trader successes, it is always worth remembering that stellar successes become known far more frequently than ruinous failures with the extraordinary risks being highlighted by a recent BInance study showcasing that 97% of all such coins and tokens ever created ‘have died.’ Featured image via Shutterstock The post Crypto trader turns $450K into $8M in a month appeared first on Finbold .",POSITIVE,SOL,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Finbold,https://finbold.com/crypto-trader-turns-450k-into-8m-in-a-month/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png

The milestone event has allowed the first cryptocurrency to achieve a market capitalization of over $2 trillion, underscoring its importance as the most coveted and valuable investment asset in history, surpassing even gold. The rise in capitalization came on a protracted wave of Bitcoin’s gradual appreciation, which started sharply on November 6 after the announcement of the results of the presidential elections in the United States, which saw crypto-friendly candidate Donald Trump take the lead. Bitcoin then started its sharp appreciation, jumping from $68,000 to over $75,000 in mere hours. Underpinning Reasons The appreciation of Bitcoin to over $100,000 followed shortly after president elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he had decided to nominate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as the new head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The choice of specialist to advice on cryptocurrency matters was lauded by the crypto community, since Atkins is a former federal regulator and is well known as an adviser of financial firms and cryptocurrency companies on legal matters pertaining to regulation “Paul Atkins was made for this job,” as legal chief Dan Gallagher of Robinhood Markets Inc. commented on Trump’s decision. The appointment followed a series of announcements made by leading US administration specialists regarding the nature of Bitcoin. The same day of Trump’s decision to appoint Atkins, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell made a statement on the status of Bitcoin as an investment tool: “People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset. It’s like gold, it’s just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital. People are not using it as a form of payment or a store of value,” Powell stated. “It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar; it’s really a competitor for gold,” as he concluded. The appointment of Atkins marks a diametric shift in the US government’s stance on cryptocurrencies, considering the negative attitude the Biden administration had taken against digital assets. The outgoing administration had taken considerable action against both select cryptocurrencies and crypto firms, as well as their founders , paying particular scrutiny to their persons and operations with crypto. The new administration that Trump is assembling seems to be taking a proactive stance and is willing to embrace cryptocurrencies by partnering with the community of the industry instead. This step could be construed as a means of curbing illegal activities in the crypto sector through cooperation and collaboration, instead of enforcement and relying on legal crackdowns. In his earlier speeches during the election campaign, Trump had made numerous promises to ease crypto industry related regulation and attract companies from the sector to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet.” This step could lead to more crypto-friendly specialists being appointed to key roles in the incoming administration, especially regulatory authority posts. The deposition of Gary Gensler, a prominent opponent of crypto, in itself was enough to uplift investor sentiment in the crypto market. The euphoria reigning on the crypto market at present can be best described as a consequence of anticipated administration change in the US. The optimistic outlooks of investors could, however, be misplaced if Trump backs down on his promises upon stepping into office in January. Investors are thus advised to curb their enthusiasm and hedge risks accordingly to suit any possible scenario and formulate exit strategies. Companies closely related to cryptocurrencies, such as asset management firms and business software developers like MicroStrategy, have also welcomed Trump’s reshuffling of administration posts. This is especially true, considering that the company is known to be officially the largest Bitcoin holder in the United States as a publicly traded enterprise. The positive aspect is, however, more reserved for companies operating in United States Dollars, considering that Bitcoin has become inaccessible to most legal entities and individuals outside the US. The Risks While the market at large is celebrating Bitcoin’s milestone, there are risks involved and there is also regulation to take into account. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance may turn out to be a business venture, considering that he has recently established World Liberty Financial – a company made up of his family members intended as a platform for trading cryptocurrencies. With that in mind, crypto enthusiasts who have long lobbied for regulation change could find themselves overboard or lacking legitimacy. The current market situation could reverse at any moment, just as it had during the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw Bitcoin climb up to $69,000 in late 2021 just to plummet below $17,000 by late 2022 against the backdrop of the FTX exchange collapse. All crypto traders and experts stress the need for caution and selection of reliable business partners and platforms when operating with cryptocurrencies. Work with the Pros The new ATH of Bitcoin is a sure sign that a sharp rise in demand for crypto is inevitable market-wide. In order to stay ahead of the curb and catch the most profitable signals, it is imperative to work with the most reliable partners in the industry. Entering on the lows is the first principle of crypto trade as the foundation of the concept of “buy low, sell high”. ChangeNOW gives individuals the ideal exchange venue for making swaps at the lowest possible commissions with Bitcoin and over 1,200 other digital currencies. Any kind of operation from swaps to buy and sell is available on ChangeNOW via a convenient and all-in-one interface. Businesses accepting cryptocurrencies as means of payment from their clients using NOWPayments API will find it extremely profitable to have their operations routed through the service. Anything from 24/7 support in multiple languages to low commissions with instant processing will be available with the NOWPayments API for businesses. Companies considering the option of attracting crypto clients should turn to ChangeNOW and connect the NOWPayments service to fast-track their operations with cryptocurrencies and create an instant point-of-service. Takeaway As Bitcoin strives up the price charts, crypto market participants are rallying to reap the profits. It remains to be seen whether Donald Trump will live up to his word and ease the administration’s stance on cryptocurrencies, but for now, his decision to appoint Atkins as head of the SEC is a step in the right direction that the market was hoping to witness. While the market overheats, both individuals and businesses will find no better partner on the market than ChangeNOW for all their crypto operation needs.

The largest cryptocurrency pulled back shortly after, down nearly 6% from its all-time high. Altcoins reacted to the development, and a market-wide correction followed. Most alts in the top 20 erased between 1 and 5% of their value within a 24-hour period. Top 10 altcoins price change in 24 hours | Source: Crypto.news Analysts at Crypto Finance, a part of the Deutsche Börse Group, believe that the catalyst for the surge in BTC was Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at the DealBook Summit, where he compared bitcoin to gold rather than the US dollar.

Gensler, who was widely criticized by crypto investors during his tenure, will leave just days before a major decision in the SEC’s ongoing legal battle with Ripple , set for January 25, 2025. What Gary Gensler’s Departure Means for the SEC’s Ripple Lawsuit However, despite Gensler’s departure, the future of the SEC’s approach to crypto remains uncertain. Bill Morgan , an attorney closely following the case, pointed out that the SEC’s new chief litigation counsel, Jorge Tenreiro, is deeply involved in the Ripple litigation. Tenreiro, who will be the key lawyer in the SEC v. Ripple case, may continue in this role even after the confirmation of the new SEC commissioner, Paul Atkins. Morgan expressed skepticism about any significant shift in the SEC’s stance on crypto if Tenreiro remains in charge of the litigation. Morgan warned against assuming that the SEC’s decision not to file its brief in the Ripple case by January 15, 2025, signals a change in approach. He said that Tenreiro would still be handling it. Morgan wrote, “If Tenreiro stays in the new role it will not signal a big change in SEC enforcement policy towards crypto. Even if there is a change the SEC v Ripple Appeal may continue.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is XRP Still a Good Buy for You?

Fagel asked whether there was any example of a new SEC administration dismissing a pending enforcement action, though he acknowledged that future changes could deviate from past norms. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37290367,https://coinpaper.com/6409/trump-taps-david-sacks-to-shape-us-crypto-and-ai-strategy,1733491527,Trump Taps David Sacks to Shape US Crypto and AI Strategy,"The United States is poised for a significant shift in its approach to technology and finance as President-elect Donald Trump outlines key appointments to lead his administration's strategy on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. David Sacks, a prominent venture capitalist, has been tapped as the ”White House A.I. & Crypto Czar,” tasked with developing a clear regulatory framework for crypto and ensuring American competitiveness in emerging technologies. Simultaneously, Trump’s pick for SEC chair, former commissioner Paul Atkins, has sparked optimism among crypto executives who see his potential to foster collaboration and provide much-needed regulatory clarity. Donald Trump Appoints David Sacks as White House A.I. & Crypto Czar President-elect Donald Trump has named David Sacks, venture capitalist and co-host of the All In podcast, as his lead policy adviser for these domains. Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social platform , declaring Sacks the official ”White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” This appointment signals a pivotal moment for the US, with Trump emphasizing that artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency are ”critical to the future of American competitiveness.” Trump’s announcement highlighted Sacks’ primary mission: creating a legal framework for the cryptocurrency industry. This move aims to address longstanding demands from the crypto sector for regulatory clarity, a factor that many believe has driven blockchain innovation and investment away from the US. “He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for and can thrive in the US,” Trump wrote. This aligns with the president-elect’s broader vision of transforming the US into the ”world capital of crypto,” a campaign promise that resonated strongly with tech-savvy voters and financial innovators. Beyond regulation, Trump’s campaign pledged to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and mine ”all the remaining Bitcoin” within the US, a strategy that could position America as a global leader in blockchain technology. Sacks’ responsibilities extend beyond crypto. He is tasked with leading efforts to safeguard online speech, a role Trump defined as steering the nation “away from Big Tech bias and censorship.” This mission, though somewhat unexplained in Trump’s post, aligns with Sacks’ prior critiques of centralized technology platforms and their influence on free expression. Additionally, Sacks will chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, signaling that his influence will span multiple dimensions of technological advancement. With his extensive background in technology and venture capital, Sacks brings a wealth of experience to these interconnected challenges. Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrency marks a significant departure from traditional US policy toward digital assets. His plans include creating a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, potentially reversing the trend of enforcement-focused oversight seen under previous administrations. The announcement follows Trump’s campaign rhetoric, which included promises to solidify the US as a hub for blockchain innovation. This vision is likely to resonate with major stakeholders in the crypto industry, who have long sought clear guidelines to foster innovation within the nation’s borders. Trump’s latest move has already sparked heated debate within the crypto community. While many see this as a promising step toward regulatory clarity and growth, others remain skeptical of centralized intervention in what has traditionally been a decentralized ecosystem. Critics argue that combining cryptocurrency with AI under a centralized ”Czar” raises concerns about government overreach and potential unintended consequences. Moreover, Trump’s call for ”all the remaining Bitcoin” to be mined domestically has drawn skepticism, as mining resources are globally distributed and reliant on free-market mechanisms. The Stakes for US Competitiveness By placing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency at the forefront of his administration’s policy agenda, Trump aims to position the US as a global leader in these cutting-edge industries. In his Truth Social post, Trump described these areas as critical to the nation’s future competitiveness, a statement that shows his administration’s focus on leveraging emerging technologies to boost economic growth and strategic security. Sacks, known for his investments in tech startups and his outspoken views on free speech, seems poised to bring a blend of innovation and advocacy to the role. However, his ability to navigate the complex and often contentious intersection of policy, technology, and finance will be tested in the months to come. Trump’s decision to appoint David Sacks as White House A.I. & Crypto Czar represents a defining moment in US policy, with significant implications for the future of cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and online freedom. While the road ahead is fraught with challenges, the administration’s commitment to positioning the US as a leader in these transformative industries is clear. As the nation prepares for Trump’s presidency, all eyes will be on Sacks and his ability to deliver on these ambitious promises. Crypto Industry Reacts Positively to Paul Atkins as Trump’s SEC Chair Pick The cryptocurrency industry in the United States is voicing cautious optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The announcement has ignited discussions across the crypto landscape, as executives, legal experts, and blockchain advocates assess what the new leadership might mean for the sector. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner who served from 2002 to 2008 under President George W. Bush, is widely regarded as a pragmatic regulator with a business-friendly approach. If confirmed, his appointment could mark a significant shift in the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation, potentially moving away from enforcement-led actions under the current chair, Gary Gensler. Katherine Dowling, general counsel at Bitwise Asset Management, described Atkins as a “great choice” for the SEC’s top job. Speaking in a Dec. 5 interview with Bloomberg, Dowling expressed optimism about Atkins’ ability to foster collaboration between regulators and lawmakers. “We’re very much looking forward to a person who can come in, hit the ground running, work with the other commissioners, and hopefully also have a dialogue with the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] and with lawmakers so in the new Congress we can get some clarity, we can get some forward motion: stablecoin bill, market structure,” said Dowling. Her remarks echo widespread calls from the crypto industry for regulatory clarity. Many believe Atkins’ leadership could usher in a more constructive relationship between the SEC, Congress, and other regulatory bodies, paving the way for legislative progress on critical issues like stablecoins and market structure. Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal were among the prominent crypto executives to endorse Trump’s pick. Garlinghouse, whose company has been embroiled in a high-profile legal battle with the SEC since 2020, praised Atkins for his potential to restore “common sense” to the agency. Ripple has long criticized the SEC’s litigation-focused approach, arguing that it stifles innovation and lacks clear guidance for crypto firms. “Paul Atkins at the helm of the SEC will bring common sense back to the agency,” Garlinghouse wrote in a Dec. 4 post on X. Coinbase, another major target of the SEC under Gensler’s tenure, also welcomed the news. Grewal called Atkins’ appointment “sorely needed,” noting that the SEC’s current enforcement-first strategy has left the crypto industry in a state of uncertainty. Coinbase has been fighting a lawsuit filed by the SEC in June 2023, which alleges that the exchange offered unregistered securities. The Ripple Effect on Regulation Atkins’ tenure at the SEC predates the rise of cryptocurrencies, but his track record suggests he could bring a more balanced approach to the regulatory landscape. In a February 2023 interview, Atkins advocated for a regulatory framework that is “more accommodating” to crypto firms, emphasizing the importance of fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Ripple’s ongoing case with the SEC, which resulted in a $125 million judgment against the company in August, could be a litmus test for Atkins’ leadership. The case remains in flux as the SEC appeals portions of the ruling, leaving the crypto industry eager to see how the new chair might influence its resolution. Despite the warm reception from many in the crypto space, Atkins’ path to confirmation is not without obstacles. The US Senate, where Republicans hold a slim majority starting in 2025, will need to approve his nomination. While Atkins enjoys support from key figures in the industry, some lawmakers may raise concerns about his ties to crypto advocacy groups and his perceived leniency toward the sector. As the CEO of Patomak Global Partners and a member of the Digital Chamber of Commerce’s advisory board, Atkins has been actively engaged with the blockchain and crypto industries. However, his specific stance on issues like initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and stablecoin regulation remains unclear. For years, crypto advocates have criticized the SEC’s lack of clear rules, accusing the agency of regulating by enforcement rather than through transparent guidelines. Atkins’ potential leadership offers a chance to reset this dynamic. Many in the industry hope his tenure will prioritize collaboration and provide a roadmap for sustainable growth in the US crypto market.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6409/trump-taps-david-sacks-to-shape-us-crypto-and-ai-strategy,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37290428,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623748,1733491181,BofA’s Hartnett warns of building risks in US stocks and crypto,"Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett has raised an alarm about the US financial market. He said that although US stocks and crypto have experienced robust rallies, the asset classes are appearing frothy. After maintaining a pessimistic stance in 2023, the strategist chose a more neutral stance toward equities this year. The S&P 500 experienced a 27% increase in 2024 and is currently on course to achieve its best year since 2019. This has been attributed to the optimism surrounding artificial intelligence and the belief that President-elect Donald Trump’s “America First” policies would stimulate domestic markets. BofA’s Hartnett 2025 overshoot theory Hartnett said that the S&P 500 is at a significant risk of “overshoot” in early 2025 if it reaches 6,666 points, which is approximately 10% above its current level. There is currently no indication of exuberance among global investors, as indicated by the bank’s bull-and-bear indicator. According to reports, the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio increased to 5.3 times in 2024, which is on the brink of the 5.5 times it reached at the height of the technology bubble in March 2000. In a report published on November 28, Michael Hartnett said, “Invest in international stocks during the second quarter due to the aggressive easing of financial conditions overseas and the panic in Europe/Asia policy.” Comparison of cumulative inflow to equity funds decade-to-date between the US and the rest of the world. In addition, according to BofA, investors should acquire 10-year US Treasuries when yields reach 5%, as this level would result in volatility and risk-asset losses, a peak “inflation boom,” and innovative solutions to reduce the US budget deficit. Also, analysts at Bank of America suggest that investors seeking a contrarian investment in 2025 should invest in “BIG” – bonds, international equities, and gold. Hartnett agrees with this assertion. The current situation in the crypto industry Hartnett’s worries have substance, but they have not deterred progress in the crypto industry. Bitcoin’s recent surge beyond $100,000 has resulted in waves, with some tokens (especially memecoins) experiencing significant gains and others enduring precipitous declines. Gigachad (GIGA) is one of the victors, as it experienced a 36% increase in value following its listing on Coinbase and Kucoin. GIGA’s price increased from $0.04146 to $0.06555; however, it has encountered resistance at approximately $0.050 since then. Turbo (TURBO) has also experienced growth, as its listing on Coinbase has contributed to its price increase. In the past 24 hours, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced increases of 6.6% and 4.2%, respectively. The value of the memecoin Keyboard Cat on Base (KEYCAT) increased by 21.8%, while the value of newer entries such as Ski Mask Dog (SKI) on the Base chain surged by 50.8%. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), however, experienced a 26.5% decline, while Moo Deng (MOODENG) experienced a substantial 19.5% decline. Other tokens, such as Fwog (FWOG) and Non-Playable Coin (NPC), also experienced losses, with a 9.4% and 13% decline, respectively. In addition, problems have arisen for specific tokens due to developer manipulation. The value of Flog the Frog (FLOG), a once-promising memecoin, experienced a significant decline after its developers sold their holdings, resulting in a collapse. List of cryptos with the highest gains and losses Hawk Tuah (HAWK) has encountered comparable challenges, as evidenced by its 92% decline in value subsequent to fraud claims surrounding its introduction. On the other hand, the US dollar weakened as mixed economic data shaped market sentiment, which may affect the stablecoins attached to it. This occurs in the context of a broader market shakeup, which has resulted in $570 million in liquidations since Bitcoin’s fleeting decline from $100,000 to $93.7K on December 5. Crypto optimists say otherwise ARK Invest, a firm known for its positive views on Bitcoin, predicts a minimum year-end price of $124,000, based on a performance multiple of 2.48x to 2.94x. Their analysis identifies increased institutional interest and proposes that Bitcoin might be considered for US strategic reserves, which they believe would dramatically increase its market value. Jelle, a well-known analyst, indicated a bullish pennant breakthrough and set a goal of $130,000. Another trader, Aksel Kibar, cited $137,000 as Bitcoin’s next key resistance level, claiming that $100,000 is not a psychologically or technically significant price point. Kalshi’s analysis also shows a 10% chance of Bitcoin reaching $150,000. However, more ambitious predictions, such as Bitcoin reaching $250,000, are viewed skeptically, with Polymarket assigning only a 2% probability to this scenario.

While the reasons for this historic rise in the market continue to be discussed, Citigroup analysts said that Bitcoin exceeded $100,000 thanks to the positive regulatory environment and macroeconomic supports in the USA. Citigroup stated in a recent report that Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000 was due to the US elections and the appointment of cryptocurrency lover Paul Atkins as SEC chairman, Coindesk reported. At this point, analysts stated that the upward momentum that started after Donald Trump won the elections was supported by factors such as a positive macroeconomic environment and increasing spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Analysts led by Alex Saunders stated that the last upward move needed to break $ 100,000 was Trump's appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chairman, and said, “The nomination of cryptocurrency friend Paul Atkins as SEC chairman provided the final momentum that allowed Bitcoin to exceed $ 100,000 and reach record levels.” Analysts also noted in the report that there has been a decline in BTC dominance and said that altcoins other than Bitcoin could see greater gains due to regulatory relaxation. “A new regulatory framework that would come with Trump’s election could expand the use cases for cryptocurrencies and elevate Bitcoin’s position as an asset class. Altcoins other than Bitcoin will also benefit from this environment.” *This is not investment advice.

37292380,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/solana-sol-to-800-seems-so-far-but-it-will-happen-sooner-than-you-expect,1733490834,"Solana (SOL) to $800 Seems So Far, But It Will Happen Sooner Than You Expect","At the time of writing, the price of one Solana stands at $224.01, which is a sign of upward movement by 40.70% in the last month. Although $800 might seem like a far-off target, it might materialize far sooner than most investors would have anticipated. This hope has been strengthened by analysts such as Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision and Global Macro Investor. With a more aspirational projection of $2,500 in a peak market scenario, Pal recently set a ""worst-case"" price goal of $800 for Solana in the next bull run. Key Drivers Behind Solana’s Impressive Trajectory Solana appeals mostly for its strategic developments and technical excellence. Well-known for its low fees and lightning-fast transaction rates, Solana has regularly exceeded its rivals in performance standards. Rising inflows reflect rising confidence in the scalability and promise of the blockchain, and institutional investors are noting this. Potential approval of a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) adds to the thrill. An ETF would greatly increase its attraction by giving institutional investors a controlled way to expose Solana. Although this is still a possibility for now, the conjecture by itself has already created a surge of hope that fuels increased demand for SOL tokens. How Soon Can Solana Achieve $800? Solana's road to $800 is more reasonable and direct than it first seems. Driven by a mix of utility, network effects, and market mood, historical trends demonstrate that assets like Solana often undergo an exponential increase during bull markets. In this approaching bull run, Solana will hit $800. One important determinant will be its ongoing acceptance in the DeFi and NFT domains. Solana is already rather popular as a platform for developing scalable apps; its value will only grow with more use cases and collaborations. Moreover, Solana gains from the spillover impact as the larger cryptocurrency market is ready to surge after Bitcoin's halving event in 2024. Also quite important will be institutional acceptance. An ETF's potential, as well as the current attention from asset managers and hedge funds, could be a spark for the significant price increase. Rexas Finance (RXS): Outshining Solana’s Price Gain While Solana’s prospects are undeniably strong, emerging tokens like Rexas Finance (RXS) are making waves with their potential to deliver even greater returns. Rexas Finance has positioned itself as a groundbreaking project in the realm of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a rapidly growing sector in blockchain technology. With approximately $21.78 million already raised, Rexas Finance (RXS) is in Stage 9 presale and costs $0.125 as of writing. As the initiative aims to tokenize and trade real-world assets such as real estate, art, and commodities, so highlights the growing faith in the idea. At the official token price of $0.20, early Rexas Finance presale investors have already assured a near 2x return. As the project picks momentum, market analysts forecast an exponential rise for RXS with possible returns of over 12,000%. Such expansion would much exceed Solana's path to $800, so RXS appeals to investors looking for quick profits. The project's $1 million giveaway campaign has added even more impetus, attracting almost 383,000 people anxious to win one of the 20 prizes at $50,000 each. This general involvement highlights the growing interest in RXS and its ability to change the RWA tokenizing scene. Furthermore, renowned market experts have endorsed Rexas Finance since they believe the token might exceed even Solana's aggressive pricing expectations. Being a Solana competitor, RXS is defining its niche with an eye toward real-world asset tokenization, a market with almost infinite development potential. Conclusion Though Solana's path to $800 seems far off, the blockchain's remarkable success records, ecosystem expansion, and rising institutional use make it a reasonable aim that will occur sooner. The tipping point might be the possible acceptance of a Solana ETF, which would set off a flood of capital, driving the token to unprecedented heights. Both Solana and Rexas Finance present interesting opportunities for investors wishing to seize the next great chance. On its road to $800, though, RXS may very well outshine Solana with its distinctive value proposition and expected expansion.

37289938,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742598-bitcoin-etfs-showdown-fbtc-trails-ibit-in-liquidity-but-fits-retirement-accounts?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1733490544,Bitcoin ETFs Showdown: FBTC Trails IBIT In Liquidity But Fits Retirement Accounts,"Summary With Bitcoin surpassing $100,000, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund is among the most prominent ETFs approved in 2024. I compare this fund to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. FBTC boasts strong marketing support from Fidelity, a competitive 0.25% expense ratio, and AUM of $19.63 billion. However, its liquidity lags behind IBIT, with a higher average bid/ask spread. IBIT benefits from a ""virtuous cycle,"" where its superior liquidity attracts frequent traders, enhancing its spread. In contrast, FBTC experiences a ""vicious cycle,"" with declining trading activity. IBIT remains the preferred choice for investors with equal access due to its liquidity advantage. However, FBTC is a solid option for those restricted to Fidelity accounts, offering competitive exposure without major drawbacks. This is the third article in my ""Bitcoin ETFs Showdown"" series, where I compare various Bitcoin ETFs against the IBIT ETF. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) having traded above $100,000 for the first time in early December 2024, readers might be seeking the best Bitcoin ETFs to gain exposure to this asset class. In this article, I will focus on the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs approved earlier this year. This is the third article of my ""Bitcoin ETFs Showdown"" series, which I am writing as part of Seeking Alpha's outreach program. Previously, I covered the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BTCW ) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ). As usual, I will compare the FBTC ETF with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management ((AUM)) and one of the most liquid funds. So far, IBIT has ""won"" against the other two ETFs I analyzed. This series does not aim to determine whether now is the best time to invest in Bitcoin. In my view, Bitcoin remains a high-risk, asymmetric opportunity with the potential to become a global reserve asset - even after its recent bull run. Investors hesitant about Bitcoin should review its fundamentals and consider whether it aligns with their risk tolerance and long-term objectives. For a deeper dive into my Bitcoin investment thesis, you can explore more on my Seeking Alpha profile . FBTC: ETF Profile The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, in my view, is one of the best-marketed Bitcoin ETFs launched this year. Fidelity's institutional webpage describes the ETF as "" an easier path to crypto, "" which I believe perfectly captures the reason why I think most investors should prefer ETFs for Bitcoin exposure: ease of use. This said, I recognize hardcore Bitcoin enthusiasts might take issue with the use of ""crypto"" instead of ""Bitcoin"" in that prominent sentence at the top of the page. This terminology comes from Fidelity's broader offerings in terms of crypto funds, including their recently launched Ethereum ETF, featured on their Crypto Funds webpage . Terminology aside, I see Fidelity as an active promoter of its FBTC ETF. They claim that ""Fidelity has been researching bitcoin and developing blockchain solutions since 2014"", and provide a series of videos where Fidelity experts discuss the evolution of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Their prospectus for FBTC is also very detailed and conveniently available in one location, updated to its latest issue. This, in my opinion, contrasts with other Bitcoin ETFs, such as BTCW and ARKB, which I covered recently. Considering Bitcoin's somewhat exotic nature as an asset class, I view it as a positive when issuers actively promote their Bitcoin funds. FBTC uses Coinbase as a custodian, like IBIT and almost all Bitcoin ETFs in the market. This represents a core risk of investing in Bitcoin via ETFs - something I covered in my past articles and I will cover again for FBTC in the risk section. I find FBTC's prospectus to provide a great amount of detail about the risks and characteristics of a custodian setup for Bitcoin. For example, this is what Fidelity states in relation to security custodian risk: The Trust could experience unforeseen issues relating to the performance and effectiveness of the security procedures used to protect the Trust's account with the Custodian Another great example of how detailed Fidelity's prospectus is concerns their statement in relation to a hard fork event on the Bitcoin blockchain: In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin network, the Sponsor will, as permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, use its sole discretion to determine, in good faith, which peer-to-peer network, among a group of incompatible forks of the Bitcoin network… Readers unfamiliar with the concept of a ""hard fork"" may find it helpful to refer to one of my earlier articles on Bitcoin, where I explain this term and discuss how the 2017 Bitcoin Cash hard determined Bitcoin's rise as a reserve asset rather than a digital currency. Key metrics at a glance The FBTC ETF has the following key metrics at the time of writing: Expense ratio of 0.25%, with no waiver for any holding period or timeline. Asset Under Management of $19.63 billion - the third-largest Bitcoin ETF at the time of writing, only behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) by a few million. Average Bid/Ask Spread of 0.039%. Average Daily Trading Volume of $342 million. Overall, I consider FBTC an excellent Bitcoin ETF with solid liquidity and a reasonable expense ratio. While it does lag behind IBIT in terms of liquidity (as I will describe in the next section), I believe it offers a viable option for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. In particular, investors limited to FBTC - such as those with Fidelity retirement accounts - should, in my opinion, find it a suitable choice without the need to pursue access to IBIT. FBTC vs. IBIT IBIT vs. FBTC, key metrics (Author's elaboration of data from Seeking Alpha, ETF.com) The table above compares the key metrics of FBTC and IBIT. While both ETFs are substantial in terms of AUM, IBIT is clearly pulling ahead, boasting more than double FBTC's assets under management. Interestingly in my view, FBTC's daily trading volume has dropped by nearly 50% over the past three months, even as its AUM grew by 71%. In contrast, IBIT has seen a 30% increase in daily trading volume. This is due to IBIT's liquidity virtuous cycle: as the largest and most liquid Bitcoin ETF, IBIT attracts frequent traders, which further enhances its liquidity in the form of a better Bid / Ask Spread. This liquidity also benefits less active investors through tighter spreads. On the contrary, FBTC - like most other Bitcoin ETFs - is the victim of a vicious cycle: as frequent traders gravitate toward the more liquid IBIT, FBTC's average Bid/Ask spread gradually increases, making the ETF less competitive over time. FBTC's main drawback-shared by nearly all Bitcoin ETFs-is exactly its higher average spread compared to IBIT. While this isn't necessarily a dealbreaker, I would advise investors with equal access to both funds to favor IBIT. This trend aligns with my earlier observations: IBIT is rapidly solidifying its position as the leading Bitcoin ETF, widening the gap with competitors. To remain competitive, other issuers may eventually need to reconsider their strategies when it comes to Bitcoin ETFs. I believe that Fidelity, with its robust marketing support for FBTC and significant presence in the US market, can afford to adopt a wait-and-see approach. After all, this fund has experienced a substantial increase in AUM since its launch just a few months ago. Conclusion The FBTC ETF is, in my view, the closest competitor to IBIT today. While it is still only the third-largest Bitcoin ETF by AUM, I find it likely it will take over GBTC in the upcoming months. That's because GBTC's expense ratio, at 1.50%, makes it fundamentally not competitive with other Bitcoin funds. The only drawback of FBTC is its Bid/Ask Spread, which is almost double that of IBIT. This is due to the virtuous cycle in which IBIT is preferred for active trading of Bitcoin due to its higher liquidity, further increasing its liquidity as a result. For investors who have equal access to FBTC and IBIT, I recommend IBIT due to the better Average Bid/Ask Spread. Investors who only can access FBTC, for example, because they have a retirement account with Fidelity, can feel free to choose this ETF, as the difference in liquidity is marginal in my view. Risks to Investing in Bitcoin ETFs and FBTC I do not see any major risks specific to FBTC relative to other Bitcoin ETFs. This fund shares Coinbase as a custodian with most competitors, it has a competitive expense ratio and its liquidity metrics are not that low to be specifically concerning, in my view. However, investing in Bitcoin remains a speculative bet on its potential evolution into a global reserve asset. While I personally find this opportunity compelling, it is the primary risk for investors considering FBTC or any Bitcoin ETF, and it warrants careful evaluation. Another significant risk for Bitcoin ETFs is their reliance on custodians. Funds like FBTC depend on custodians such as Coinbase to securely hold their Bitcoin. Any fraudulent activity or security breach involving the custodian could result in substantial losses for investors. The reliance on a single custodian concerns FBTC as well as most other Bitcoin ETFs.",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742598-bitcoin-etfs-showdown-fbtc-trails-ibit-in-liquidity-but-fits-retirement-accounts?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37289938.jpeg

Its most recent performance reveals a startling 38.66% rise in the past month and a nearly 2x year-to-date increase. These successes highlight Solana's endurance in a crowded market and rising appeal. However, the question remains: Is buying Solana above $200 the smartest move for investors seeking exponential returns? A more compelling opportunity lies in Rexas Finance (RXS), a rising star in the crypto world priced at just $0.125 during its presale. Regarding return on investment, this alternative presents a special mix of creativity, accessibility, and exponential development potential that could much exceed Solana. Here's why buying Rexas Finance (RXS) at $0.125 is a much smarter choice. Rexas Finance (RXS): Redefining Tokenization and Accessibility Rexas Finance (RXS) is carving a niche in the crypto scene by streamlining and democratizing the development and administration of digital tokens. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself by emphasizing tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). Users may tokenize real estate, art, goods, intellectual property, and other assets with its creative platform to enable fractional ownership or complete asset acquisition never before possible. This disruptive approach aligns with the broader trend of integrating blockchain technology into traditional industries, unlocking new investment opportunities for users worldwide. Rexas Finance is a revolution in asset management since it lets everyone, anywhere, invest in real assets with only a click. Presale Success and Strong Market Sentiment Rexas Finance's presale has been a spectacular success, raising above $21.04 million as it moves into Stage 9, priced at $0.125 as of writing. This remarkable fundraising target shows rising investor belief in the platform's ability to upset the market. Rexas Finance chose a public presale instead of numerous initiatives seeking venture capital money to guarantee greater involvement in its goal of decentralization and accessibility. After its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, the token's visibility has also increased, augmenting its presale momentum. Rexas Finance (RXS) is positioned for notable market traction and price appreciation, and after the presale, it intends to list on three top 10 tier 1 exchanges. Certik, one of the most credible blockchain security companies, has carefully examined Rexas Finance. This certification emphasizes the project's dedication to dependability, openness, and investment security. Projects with solid bases and trust-building strategies, like Rexas Finance, are more likely to draw long-term investors as the crypto industry develops. The Case Against Buying Solana Above $200 Although Solana's price surge lately is remarkable, its present valuation above $200 begs questions about declining returns. For Solana, market analysts project a maximum objective of $400, corresponding to a possible 2x return from its present price. Although a 2x increase is noteworthy, it is not worth compared to the explosive potential of newly started enterprises like Rexas Finance (RXS). Solana's hefty entrance price makes it less appealing to investors looking for appreciable upside possibilities. Moreover, given the unpredictable character of the crypto market, investing in well-known high-value coins increases your chance of stagnation or correction. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Better ROI Investment In contrast to Solana's limited price trajectory, Rexas Finance offers unparalleled growth potential. For presale investors, the token's expected $0.20 listing price at launch already promises over 2x profits. However, the long-term outlook is even more enticing. From its existing presale price of $0.125, analysts estimate Rexas Finance (RXS) might climb to $50, an amazing 400x gain. Rexas Finance's special value proposition and the growing acceptance of RWA tokenization fuel such exponential development. The platform changes the blockchain scene since it can tokenize almost any asset and offer worldwide access. Moreover, the choice to prioritize public involvement over venture capital financing improves the project's reputation and community-driven character. As the platform expands, this strategy guarantees a more fair sharing of rewards and builds confidence. Purchasing Solana (SOL) above $200 could appeal to cautious investors looking for consistency and a slow increase. Rexas Finance (RXS) at $0.125 is the wiser option, though, for those wishing to optimize their gains and profit from the next great thing in crypto. With its emphasis on tokenizing real-world assets, great presale performance, and possible exponential development, Rexas Finance presents an unparalleled chance to create riches in the ever-changing realm of cryptocurrencies.

Notably, with a neutral price action over the last seven days, this altcoin has entered into a consolidated price trend. TradingView: SOL/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) constantly acts as a resistance to the SOL price chart in the daily time frame. This highlights a weak bullish sentiment for the altcoin in the cryptocurrency market. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a constant decline in its red histogram, whereas its averages show a steady decline. This suggests a mixed price action for the 05th largest crypto token. Will SOL Hit $300 In 2024? Suppose, the market bulls regain traction, this could result in the Solana price breaching its $250 mark and retesting its high of $263.83. Moreover, if the bullish sentiment intensifies, it could head toward its upper price target of $300 this year. Conversely, if the bears outrun the bulls, this could result in the SOL coin price retesting its psychological barrier of $225. Negatively, if the bears fail to regain momentum at that point, this could pull the price of this altcoin toward its lower support level of $210.

From Dogecoin's continued dominance to BlockDAG's innovative approach to meme coin infrastructure, the potential for gains is enormous. Crypto traders serious about maximizing returns in this booming space should check out these top altcoins and meme coins making waves in 2024: BlockDAG, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin, & Dogwifhat. Let’s take a closer look at each of these cryptos. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Top Layer 1 Crypto & The Future Meme Coin Hub BlockDAG (BDAG) is a unique project that has positioned itself as a critical player in the meme coin ecosystem. While BDAG is not a meme coin itself, its low-code/no-code feature makes it a powerful platform for the creation of meme coins, offering a user-friendly solution for those who want to tap into the meme coin craze. This feature allows creators to launch their meme coins with ease, eliminating the need for deep technical knowledge. Beyond token creation, BlockDAG’s advanced architecture offers high transaction throughput, allowing meme coin projects to scale quickly and efficiently. The ability to create and trade meme coins faster and cheaper gives BlockDAG a competitive edge over traditional blockchain platforms like Solana. BlockDAG is currently in its presale, which has been a massive success with over $157.5 million raised and 16.8 billion coins sold. Priced at just $0.0234 in batch 26, early backers have already seen a 2240% ROI since batch 1. The speed at which presale batches are progressing highlights the growing interest in BlockDAG, making it an exciting option for meme coin enthusiasts and traders alike. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the original meme coin, and it's showing no signs of slowing down in 2024. What started as a joke has turned into a legitimate digital asset with a huge community backing it. Despite its popularity, DOGE continues to perform well in the market, making it a stable option for meme coin investors. The massive following on social media, alongside the support from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, has cemented DOGE’s position in the market. While it’s not a coin for explosive growth anymore, DOGE remains a solid investment for those looking for a safe, well-established meme coin. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The ""Dogecoin Killer"" Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been dubbed the ""Dogecoin Killer"" due to its explosive rise and its mission to offer more utility to the meme coin market. Over the past few years, SHIB has built its ecosystem, including ShibaSwap and a metaverse project, which adds more value beyond meme coin speculation. The coin's massive, active community ensures that SHIB has a strong market presence, and its continued evolution into a more complete ecosystem makes it an attractive long-term hold. 4. Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Viral Sensation Pepe Coin (PEPE) capitalized on the popularity of the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, and its rise in the meme coin scene has been nothing short of explosive. As meme coins continue to grow, PEPE stands out by embracing its viral nature and simplifying transactions for its users. This combination of humor and utility has made PEPE one of the most recognized meme coins in 2024. PEPE’s community-driven initiatives and meme culture positioning make it a coin to watch closely in the coming months. 5. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Rising New Meme Coin Dogwifhat (WIF) is another one of the new top crypto coins, which entered the meme coin market with a fun and playful approach. Capitalizing on the meme culture, WIF has attracted attention with its unique narrative and growing community. Though still new, WIF has shown early signs of potential with strong social media engagement and grassroots support. The coin’s success will largely depend on its ability to maintain interest and grow its community, but if it continues to build momentum, WIF could become a key player in the meme coin space. In Summary: The Future of Meme Coins The meme coin market remains dynamic and full of opportunities. BlockDAG offers something different by enabling the creation of meme coins through its low-code/no-code platform. This lets anyone create tokens even without any technical knowledge, making it an ideal choice for those looking to tap into the meme coin frenzy. DOGE and SHIB also continue to be strong contenders due to their established communities, while PEPE and WIF are making waves with fresh approaches. Each coin brings something unique to the table, but BlockDAG's potential as a future hub for viral meme coin creation positions it as the most promising contender to redefine the crypto world.

37289879,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623734,1733490089,OpenAI could go bankrupt between 2026 and 2028 – Elon Musk needs to do nothing,"Tesla CEO Musk recently filed a lawsuit against OpenAI to stop an alleged “illegitimate” conversion of the company to a profitable organization. Data has now emerged showing the AI startup’s struggles, which could cause it to go out of business before 2028. Elon Musk revived his legal battle against OpenAI by filing a new preliminary injunction in the US District Court in California on December 1. Musk’s initial lawsuit, filed in March 2024 in San Francisco, accused OpenAI of breaching a contract during its controversial transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity. While its legal issues with Musk grab headlines, the company’s financial performance tells a more concerning story about its future. According to a tech consultant going by the handle @dokowords on X, OpenAI is facing an existential crisis, with mounting losses and a bloated business model. OpenAI’s financial and operational woes OpenAI’s 2024 revenue is expected to reach $3.7 billion, but its costs are projected to be a staggering $8.5 billion. Doko believes this gap, which continues to widen, signals a business model that is unsustainable in the long run. In an X thread , the tech analyst listed several news reports, including one that predicted that OpenAI could accumulate losses of $44 billion by 2029, an amount that exceeds the annual budget of many of the world’s largest tech firms. X user @jokowords accuses OpenAI of revenue generation problems. Source: X The thread mentioned a report shared by Analytics India, which showed that OpenAI’s flagship product, ChatGPT alone burned $700,000 daily in 2023. According to the research , when the daily costs are combined with $7 billion allocated for AI training and inference, plus $1.5 billion for staffing costs, OpenAI’s operational costs look unsustainable, and there is no indication that these expenses will decrease in the near future. “Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in OpenAI is possibly keeping the company afloat at the moment,” the report stated. With 290,000 out of 350,000 servers running at 83% capacity on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, OpenAI’s infrastructure is likewise under tremendous demand. This is especially troublesome since the business finds it difficult to satisfy the needs of its constantly expanding user base, which now numbers over 100 million daily active users and receives 3.6 billion monthly website visits, a 100% increase from the previous year. The corporation just claimed that it intends to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year, according to financial data disclosed by The New York Times. ChatGPT is expected to contribute $2.7 billion of that total. The remaining $1 billion will come from the company’s various business operations. However, the business claimed that it expects a $5 billion loss, excluding equity-based pay. Competition from other AI startups OpenAI’s business model faces stiff competition from rivals such as Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. While the AI entity struggles with $8.5 billion in losses, Microsoft is building its own AI infrastructure, and Anthropic operates more efficiently with just $2.7 billion in costs. Google, on the other hand, is planning to invest a massive $100 billion into AI development, relying on in-house infrastructure rather than paying for external services. Last year, Elon Musk launched his own xAI, which recently raised $6 billion in a funding round that involved over 90 participants. xAI has now raised a total of $12 billion in 2024 as it builds on its aim to compete with other AI models in the industry. OpenAI’s subscription-based revenue model, which charges users $20 a month, offers little competitive advantage, especially given the growing number of open-source alternatives. Customers can easily switch between services, making it difficult for OpenAI to retain users long-term. Despite the competition, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman has set ambitious revenue goals, predicting that the company could reach $100 billion in revenue by 2029. However, the projections seem wildly unrealistic. To meet this target, the AI company would need either a monthly subscription fee of $555 per user or 189 million paid subscribers at $44 per month, a far cry from its current base of 11 million paying users.

With the upcoming Donald Trump presidency, there have been several proposed changes supporting the growth of the industry. For ETF investors, the onslaught of crypto ETF launches has created some short-sighted excitement. The spot bitcoin ETF launch, in particular, contributed to some buzz around rising bitcoin prices that seemed to cloud the long-term growth drivers of the industry. But post-election, long-term views on cryptocurrencies have been very bullish, driving bitcoin prices up ~60% in the fourth quarter to a milestone $100,000. Now, investors have returned their interest to crypto and bitcoin ETFs. Recently, I attended the North American Blockchain Summit in Dallas, Texas, a digital asset policy conference (conveniently located ten minutes away from me). Speakers included some of crypto's greatest minds, such as executives from Coinbase Global (COIN), Canaan (CAN), Riot Platforms (RIOT), Core Scientific (CORZ), Hive Digital Technologies (HIVE), and MARA Holdings (MARA). Speakers also included some pro-crypto politicians like Senator Paul Toomey, Paul Ryan (former speaker of the house), Stephen Harper (former Canadian Prime Minister), Mike Pompeo, Congressman French Hill, and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer. Unsurprisingly, ETFs were only mentioned a couple of times throughout the conference. Instead, conversation revolved around long-term growth drivers like the political landscape, artificial intelligence, and tokenization. Here are some of the biggest tailwinds from the conference. Political Landscape Driving Tailwinds With the upcoming Donald Trump presidency, there have been several proposed changes supporting the growth of the industry. One potential change has been the start of a ""crypto czar"" position at the White House. But Trump has also been filling the White House with pro-crypto connections. Among others, he has nominated Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick to the Department of Commerce and Scott Bessent (a very crypto-friendly hedge fund manager) as Treasury secretary. On top of this, Gary Gensler has stepped down from his post (as expected, but on a slightly earlier timeline). This was met with applause at least three times from the audience. Other items discussed include a potential U.S. strategic reserve, which could help grow U.S. assets and hedge debt. According to Arkham, the U.S. government already holds almost 200 units of seized Bitcoin, currently valued at around $19 billion. These tailwinds have created a different outlook for crypto. It drives the price from not just excitement but from long-term anticipation. YTD, spot bitcoin ETFs have about $32 billion in net inflows. Excluding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has had large outflows since its conversion, the group has seen $52 billion of net inflows. Looking at this another way, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) itself gathered almost $33 billion in net inflows over the year. Quarter-to-date, IBIT saw $11 billion in net inflows. That includes the weeks leading up to the election, the election itself, and some time post-election. With a more pro-crypto landscape, issuers have also become more optimistic and have ramped up filings. I expect the ecosystem to build out more in 2025 - including potential approvals of other spot crypto ETFs like Solana and XRP. So far, VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital have filed for Solana ETFs. The latter three, along with WisdomTree, have filed for an XRP ETF. Canary Capital also has a filing for a Litecoin ETF. I also expect more active strategies (several launched in the second half of 2024), including leveraged and options-based ETFs. See my previous note for a summary of the current crypto ETF landscape. The Large Intersection Between AI and Crypto Mining If you read my recent takeaways note here , it is obvious that many conversations have revolved around artificial intelligence and energy usage. One of the biggest bottlenecks is data center availability - and that's where the crypto miners come in. Crypto miners, who had previously been struggling with falling bitcoin prices, have started diversifying by using their existing mining facilities to also house data center equipment. This is a win-win for both industries. Crypto miners get a diversified revenue stream, and tech companies can take advantage of their existing structures. Mining companies including Core Scientific, Hive Digital, and Hut 8 Corp (HUT) have entered into agreements for AI hosting. Before spot bitcoin, crypto miners took the biggest hit when bitcoin fell. Like any other commodity miner, their stock price was leveraged to the price of the underlying commodity. After the FTX meltdown, the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) fell 84% in 2022. When prices started recovering the next year, the ETF was up 303%. Investors still weren't flocking to the product. Generally, they seemed to be interested in spot bitcoin ETFs over crypto equity ETFs. These ETFs may start coming back in style as mining companies are seeing potential growth opportunities. WGMI currently has $238 million in assets with $96 million in net inflows YTD. Recent ETF launches have mostly been focused on leveraged bitcoin and bitcoin options income strategies. However, State Street and Galaxy launched three digital asset ETFs holding mostly crypto equities (including mining companies), proving that innovation within crypto equity ETFs isn't dead yet. These ETFs include the SPDR Galaxy Hedged Digital Asset Ecosystem ETF (HECO), the SPDR Galaxy Digital Asset Ecosystem (DECO), and the SPDR Galaxy Transformative Tech Accelerators ETF (TEKX).

37289722,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742573-avalanche-the-avax-conundrum?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1733490000,Avalanche: The AVAX Conundrum,"Summary AVAX's ecosystem growth is primarily off C-Chain, which doesn't drive AVAX token demand, making it difficult to justify a 'buy' rating. Despite a 25% year-over-year transaction increase, active addresses and staking rewards have not shown significant growth, impacting AVAX's investment appeal. Avalanche's stablecoin supply has grown 75% year-to-date but remains small compared to other chains, limiting its competitive advantage. I hold AVAX but maintain a 'hold' rating due to its weaker fundamental setup and better alternatives like Polygon and Binance Smart Chain. When I last covered Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) in February, I called the AVAX token a 'hold' and was generally underwhelmed with the chain's usage growth. While the primary reason for that article was to explore the token's historical reaction to supply unlocks, I left readers with the following: Going forward, I'd like to see meaningful growth in users, transactions, and stablecoin footprint before I'd entertain a larger position. There were several very good comments to that piece from numerous different contributors, including fellow SA analyst Dominic Lombardo . However, where I want to give a cap-tip is to ' A Credit Risk Guy ' for saying the following: the other problem that I see is the demand for the token. This will become an issue at some point as the subnet adoption becomes bigger around their current bullish narratives of gaming and RWA. Each subnet can run with ~8 validators for 2,000 AVAX each (which is cheap), so moving the transactions to a subnet is good for the ecosystem but not good for the token demand. This is a terrific point and mirrors similar concerns I've had about Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling through L2 blockchains rather than on mainnet following the Dencun upgrade earlier this year. In this AVAX update, we'll look at how the ecosystem has grown over the last 9 months and what impact, if any, that network usage has had on AVAX token demand. Network Usage Recall, the AVAX token benefited from a large spike in transactions during the month of December last year. For the full month, there were over 137.6 million transactions last December, which happened to be almost three times the number of transactions from November 2023 and still stands as the single month record for the network. After a somewhat underwhelming year for most of 2024, we've started to see monthly transactions move higher again beginning in October: Avalanche Transactions (stats.avax.network) There were 68.5 million Avalanche transactions in October and 98.1 million in November of this year. So far, there have been 13.4 million transactions just four days into December 2024; this would project a little under 104 million transactions expected by the end of this month. With the understanding that December 2023 was a large outlier month, the year over year growth picture for the full quarter is pretty good, in my view: Monthly Transactions (millions) 2023 2024 YoY Change October 27.5 68.5 149.1% November 50.7 98.1 93.5% December* 137.6 103.7 -24.6% Q4 Sum 215.8 270.3 25.3% Source: stats.avax.network, *December 2024 total is projected based on month to date trend through 12/4/24 At a projected 25% increase year over year, the 270.3 million transactions on Avalanche in Q4 is encouraging. And I'll clarify that the December figure for 2024 is using a very small 4 day sample size to project the rest of the month at the current pace. It's very possible, if not likely, this 103.7 million number will be very different when the month is actually complete. The sustainability of this growth is tough to project because the transaction spike is happening in a very different way than it did last December: Avalanche: All vs C-Chain (Snowtrace) Data from Snowtrace shows the overwhelming majority of the increase in transactions is coming from the broader Avalanche ecosystem rather than from the C-Chain - which does not appear to have been the case last December. The recent trend in transactions seems more similar to the one that happened toward the end of 2022 - which didn't last all that long and began to fizzle out at the beginning of 2023. In any case, transaction growth is solid for now. But is that having an sort of impact on AVAX token demand? AVAX Token Demand Since AVAX is the gas that makes Avalanche move, one way to look at raw demand for the AVAX token is through gas used on the network: Avalanche Gas Used (stats.avax.network) Here we can see daily gas usage of all Avalanche L1s has indeed been increasing rather quickly beginning in October. Gas used was up 35.7% in October and 22.7% in November from a month over month standpoint. Interestingly, this two month-long jump in both gas and transactions has not appeared to produce a noticeable spike in active addresses: Avalanche Active Addresses vs Gas Used (subnets.avax.network) At 32.4k daily active addresses (or DAAs) in October and 38.2k in November, DAAs over the last two months have been about in-line with the figures from the prior year and actually well below what we saw for most of January through April. To the commenter's point that I shared in the introduction of this piece, broader ecosystem growth may not actually be of benefit to AVAX because the subnets don't actually require AVAX as gas. Something that I think AVAX investors should consider is where the network fees are coming from. Avalanche 7 Day Fees By Blockchain (Snowtrace) In the last 7 days, Avalanche has generated over $716k in blockchain fees. Nearly 93% of those fees have come from the C-Chain. And the stronger multi-year uptrend in gas used is happening away from C-Chain: Gas used trend (Snowtrace) So the question then does remain; what is the benefit to AVAX if ecosystem growth is mainly happening off C-Chain yet it's the C-Chain fees that primarily drive the organic bid for AVAX? Staking & Additional Considerations AVAX is still used for staking and offers a very competitive reward rate of 7.8% - this is higher than smart contract networks like Solana ( SOL-USD ) or Binance ( BNB-USD ) but well behind the reward rate offered by similar ecosystems like Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) or Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ). Platform/Ecosystem Staking Reward Real Rate Staking Ratio Avalanche 7.79% 3.18% 51.9% Polkadot 11.96% 4.00% 51.4% Cosmos 21.94% 8.59% 50.6% Source: StakingRewards, as of 12/5/24 Adjusting for token issuance, the real reward from staking AVAX is 3.2% annually. Which is again behind similar blockchain ecosystems that have a 'subnet' structure. Staked AVAX vs RewardRate (StakingRewards) The 12 month trend in the AVAX reward rate is down. Staked AVAX has fallen by 29 million, or 11%, over the last 12 months. The year to date trend in C-Chain validators has also been down a little bit: C-Chain Validators (subnets.avax.network) Since the start of the year, C-Chain validators have fallen about 10% percent from 1,643 down to 1,484 as of article submission. Finally, Avalanche is ranked 9th in TVL behind Sui ( SUI-USD ) with just $1.6 billion in Total Value Locked. The chain has had some growth in stablecoin footprint year to date, however: Stablecoin Supply Growth (Artemis) The chart above is showing total stablecoin supply growth in a stacked bar format. Don't get too excited about those blood red bars, those are actually Tron ( TRX-USD ). Avalanche is much harder to see as the chain makes up just $2.1 billion of the $187.5 total stablecoin market. That said, Avalanche has seen stable supply grow 75% year to date while the broader market has increased 53%. Avalanche has better supply growth, but it's from a much smaller starting point than most other chains in the broader digital asset landscape. And the $2.1 billion stable supply on Avalanche is well below the $4.3 billion peak from 2021. Closing Thoughts I like Avalanche as a user. I've never personally had a problem with it. As an investment, it's difficult for me to call AVAX a 'buy' long term due to what I've laid out in this post. 'The AVAX Conundrum' is that most of the usage growth appears to be happening off C-Chain. Yet it's the C-Chain that pays the bills for the network with the AVAX token. This is a bit more concerning than the situation that Ethereum is facing, in my opinion, because most L2 networks built on top of Ethereum still require bridged ETH to pay gas. The other thing that I find so interesting is Avalanche should theoretically be the 'high fee' refuge from Ethereum because its an EVM-compatible chain. Yet, Polygon ( MATIC-USD )(POL-USD), Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ), and Base ( COIN ) seem to be benefiting more from any potential application migration away from the relative high fee environment that is Ethereum mainnet. I do still hold a little bit of AVAX, but it's not an asset that I feel has the strongest fundamental setup at the moment. That could certainly change in the future, but for now it's still a 'hold' rather than a 'buy.'",NEGATIVE,AVAX | ETH | BNB,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742573-avalanche-the-avax-conundrum?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37289722.jpeg

It has since recovered and is holding steady above $3.5 trillion. However, as other coins were dipping, Shiba Inu and Brett prices spiked, gaining an average of 20% on the first day of the month. Shiba Inu price trend-defying run came as token burns spiked, with the community playing its part in reducing the supply of the token. Shiba Inu started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, and although nearly half was wiped out in a giveaway to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, the memecoin still has over 589 trillion tokens in supply. To trim this supply, the community conducts consistent burning, most of which comes from transaction fees. The ultimate question remains: will Shiba Inu coin price reach $1? Brett’s supply is much lower at 9.9 billion. However, its biggest push has been from the Base blockchain community, which has rallied behind its largest memecoin, which they have assigned the moniker, “PEPE’s best friend.” This led Brett to a new all-time high on the first day of December at $0.234. It has since dipped slightly but trades above $0.2, with many expecting it to retest this ATH before December ends.

Yeti Ouro has attracted plenty of interest from crypto whales and savvy investors hunting for the next 100x meme coin opportunity and the next Dogecoin rival. In its ongoing presale, Yeti Ouro has attracted $960,000 from thousands of investors, who have purchased over 79 million tokens. At $0.012, the tokens are discounted and present a lucrative investment opportunity for investors who seek to get in on the next big meme coin project before it takes off. Yeti Ouro centers around Yeti Go, a new play-to-earn game that pits players against each other on a competitive racing track, where the goal is to emerge victorious. To gain an edge, players can attack each other using weapons purchased from the in-game store or traded in the in-game marketplace. The game also offers unique skins and other customizations to enhance the experience for the players. Built using Unreal Engine from Epic Games by developers who have worked on other iconic games like Call of Duty and Spiderman, Yeti Go promises the most thrilling experience in web3 gaming.

Some tokens are gaining traction, while others face challenges. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a drop in whale activity, raising questions about its momentum. Meanwhile, a new presale project, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), is making waves by selling out 80% of its tokens ahead of schedule. Here’s what you need to know about the top cryptos this month. Shiba Inu: A Decline In Whale Activity Shiba Inu has long been a favorite among retail investors and whales alike. However, recent metrics indicate a noticeable decline in large-holder activity. According to data from Into The Block , the volume of SHIB transactions over $100,000 has dropped by 73%. Just 5.72 trillion SHIB tokens were moved in large transactions over the past 24 hours, a significant decline from the 21.23 trillion tokens moved in November. Profit-taking and the fact that the majority of large holders have moved on to buy back into other coins have contributed to this decrease in volume. While Shiba Inu remains a key player in the meme coin space, this decline in whale activity might spur short-term challenges. SHIB needs more robust community involvement to regain its previous momentum; on a technical level, it must build out the Shibarium Layer 2 network. Other Cryptos Ascending Apart from Shiba Inu, several other altcoins are worth watching in December. Over the past week, Filecoin ( FIL) has posted a gain of 33% , while Bittensor ( TAO) and Arbitrum ( ARB) also saw double-digit percentage increases: 13% for Bittensor and 16% for Arbitrum. These tokens present unique use cases like decentralized storage (Filecoin) or AI-based consensus systems (Bittensor). Consequently, as their latest performance makes clear-- it also underscores the fact that utility-driven projects garner more attention. Yeti Ouro: The New Viral Presale Capturing Attention While established tokens like Shiba Inu face hurdles, Yeti Ouro is emerging as a standout project. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this ERC-20 token combines blockchain gaming with decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a fresh take on crypto innovation. At the center of Yeti Ouro’s ecosystem is Yeti Go, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game that allows players to use YETIO tokens for in-game activities. Players can compete in high-stakes races, customize their vehicles, and earn rewards. Built on Unreal Engine, the game delivers a high-quality experience that appeals to both gamers and crypto enthusiasts. The presale for Yeti Ouro has already sold out 80% of its tokens, raising nearly $1 million. This rapid uptake reflects strong demand and growing confidence in the project’s potential. With a capped supply of 1 billion tokens and a burn mechanism to reduce circulation, Yeti Ouro is designed for long-term value appreciation.

37290361,https://thecoinrise.com/ripple-cto-discusses-xrp-price-surge-as-a-rival-real-estate-token-quietly-climbs-from-0-004-to-2/,1733489746,Ripple CTO Discusses XRP Price Surge as a Rival Real Estate Token Quietly Climbs from $0.004 to $2,"The XRP price is surging as Ripple continues to attract attention to cryptocurrency, which is supported by legal victories and innovative use cases in the financial sector. Meanwhile, as XRP price rises, another contender in the blockchain space, a real estate token, PropiChain , has been steadily climbing in value, from $0.004 to a predicted $2. This quiet but impressive growth shows how blockchain technology is transforming traditional industries like real estate. Here’s a closer look at what’s driving the XRP price’s rise, Ripple’s ongoing developments, and how this real estate-focused token is making waves in its domain. Ripple CTO Highlights XRP’s Role in Transforming Finance Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, recently weighed in on the XRP price surge, attributing it to the cryptocurrency’s growing utility and increasing adoption by financial institutions. With Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solutions gaining traction worldwide, XRP is solidifying its position as a leading digital asset for cross-border payments, causing a rise in XRP price . Legal clarity has also played a pivotal role in XRP price’s resurgence. Ripple’s partial victory in its SEC lawsuit showed that XRP is not at a security risk when sold on secondary markets. This has reignited interest from both retail and institutional investors. With partnerships spanning over 300 financial institutions and growing adoption across Europe, Asia, and Latin America, analysts are optimistic that the XRP price could reach new highs. Predictions suggest a potential rally to $10 in the next bull cycle, mirroring the kind of meteoric rise Bitcoin experienced in its early years. Real Estate Token: A Rising Star in Blockchain While Ripple focuses on revolutionizing finance, PropiChain disrupts the real estate market. PropiChain’s rise from $0.004 to a projected $2 highlights the potential of blockchain technology to unlock value in the real estate sector. Solving Real Estate’s Biggest Challenges Traditional real estate investment has significant barriers, including high capital requirements, lengthy transaction processes, and limited transparency. PropiChain addresses these issues by tokenizing real estate assets, allowing investors to purchase fractional shares of properties. This innovation democratizes access to high-value assets, enabling small-scale investors to participate in lucrative markets. PropiChain also uses AI to enhance the investor experience through: Market Analysis: The platform identifies profitable opportunities in prime locations by analyzing trends and data. Property Filtering: Personalized recommendations match properties to user preferences, simplifying decision-making. Automated Valuation: AI algorithms provide accurate property valuations in real time, ensuring fair pricing for buyers and sellers. The platform’s blockchain integration ensures transparency and trust by recording all transactions on an immutable ledger. Smart contracts automate key processes, such as payment distribution and ownership transfers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing costs. Its metaverse feature allows users to explore virtual property tours, conduct meetings, and even finalize deals in a digital environment, enhancing the global appeal of the platform. For instance, a real estate agency could use PropiChain to promote properties to international buyers without needing physical showings. Sellers benefit from a wider audience, while buyers enjoy a seamless, tech-driven experience. Early Investors Reap Rewards PropiChain’s early investors are already set to see substantial returns. The token is priced at $0.004 now, and it has since gained traction with projections of reaching $2 by Q2 2025. This remarkable growth represents a 50,000% return for those who enter early. For those who missed XRP’s initial breakout, PropiChain offers a rare second chance to achieve life-changing returns. The trajectory mirrors XRP’s 2017 rally, when XRP price went from cents to over $3, showcasing the kind of explosive growth PropiChain could achieve. The token’s credibility is further solidified by its CoinMarketCap listing and its BlockAudit certification , which confirms the project’s security and transparency. Conclusion Ripple’s XRP continues to thrive, with the XRP price set for further gains as adoption increases in the financial sector and there’s legal clarity. Meanwhile, PropiChain is emerging as a formidable player in the real estate market. Early adopters stand to gain significantly, with projections of a 50,000% return, making PropiChain one of the market’s most promising real estate tokens. With its presale price at historic lows, now is the time to act. PropiChain could soon rival XRP regarding growth potential as the token’s price rises and adoption grows.

37289356,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390128,1733489414,Why Is XRP Dropping? Is It Still Worth Holding XRP Amid Market Fluctuations?,"The post Why Is XRP Dropping? Is It Still Worth Holding XRP Amid Market Fluctuations? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Lark Dewis, an entrepreneur and crypto investor, has recently taken to X to share his views on whether XRP is still worth it. He has touched on the SEC case and its impact, recent developments, and how high XRP can go. Let’s dive deeper to know more. https://t.co/UrGyoHdTpu — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 5, 2024 XRP has lately surprised the community with its captivating gains. It is up by over an impressive 35% in the past week, currently trading at $2.29. In a couple of weeks, it broke through the one-dollar barrier and had an impressive run to almost three dollars, which is an impressive three-fold increase, Dewis noted. However, is it still worth holding? Or is it just the altcoin season effect? Dewis has delved deeper, considering the various factors leading to its ups and downs. SEC Case and Its Impact The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs in 2020, claiming XRP was sold as an unregistered security, leading to price plummeting and delisting. However, a court ruling in July 2024 clarified XRP’s status as a security on public exchanges. Moreover, lately there have been a lot of recent developments for XRP. He cited a MessariCrypto Report titled “State of XRP Ledger Q3 2024,” which provides an overview of the project’s progress. Lark shared the key insights form the report which included: Key Insights: Ripple and the XRP community plan to introduce native smart contracts on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) through an XLS proposal, enhancing the platform’s functionality, allowing for the creation of decentralized applications, and expanding its use cases. Secondly, he noted that the average daily transactions on the XRP Ledger have surged by 94% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), reaching 1.7 million, while the number of new addresses grew by 10% to 105,000, which indicates growing adoption and interest. In August, Ripple announced that its USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD , entered private beta testing on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. At the time of writing, it is waiting for approval from NYDFS. Its launch will enhance the utility and adoption of the XRP Ledger and can be a bullish catalyst. A native lending protocol is being developed to enable users to lend and borrow supported assets like XRP, stablecoins, wrapped Bitcoin, and wrapped Ethereum using single-asset vaults. How High Can XRP Go? He noted that XRP’s current market cap is at $135 billion and 1000% returns at this stage is highly unlikely. While, a 10x increase would be a very long shot that would take the market cap to $1.5 trillion. He noted that the 4.236 Fib level is around $7.3, which is approximately a 3x. However, there is no certainty this will be reached. However, with Gensler out of the picture and a pro-crypto president taking office, there are chances of an upside. The RLUSD approval could be another tailwind, he noted. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Atkins Won’t Dismiss The Ripple Case, SEC Vs XRP To Continue , Positive Developments for XRP In a recent development, Trump has nominated venture capitalist David Sacks as the White House AI & Crypto Czar , who is known for favoring Ripple in the long-running US SEC lawsuit. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CLO Stuart Alderoty believe that Sacks will push President Trump’s crypto and AI pro-innovation plans forward. It will also bring upside momentum to the cryptocurrencies he supports, including XRP and ZRX. Notably, XRP Price Is Up 400% Since Trump Won the Election . Huge congrats to @DavidSacks on this appointment – he understands tech inside and out, and importantly, will push forward President Trump’s crypto and AI pro-innovation plans. Dream team! https://t.co/FFMSCIiscl — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 6, 2024 Impact Of SEC Appeal While Trump’s moves signal a pro-crypto stance, the prospects of the SEC pursuing the appeal will likely impact XRP demand. The SEC must file its appeal-related opening brief by January 15, 2025, before Gensler departs. Chair Gensler’s final push against crypto firms and recent promotions suggest the agency will file its opening brief. However, Paul Atkins could withdraw the appeal on Day 1, setting the Programmatic Sales of XRP ruling as a pivotal legal precedent for the US crypto space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

With its impressive growth curve, Solana (SOL) remains one of the most interesting projects among competing businesses in the blockchain sphere. Recently, forecasts of Solana from a crypto trader even reaching $400, $600, and $1,000 have created controversies in the markets. True, these marks can be achieved in a perfect environment, but a strong contender for investors with solid crypto space potential has emerged as Rexas Finance (RXS). The Road Map for Solana (SOL) Blockchain technology's fastest-developing network, Solana, has managed to attract users because of its excellent transaction speed and great scalability. Such networks, however, are increasingly seen as platforms for distributed finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming applications. In the case of Solana, the network can process approximately 65,000 transactions every second while charging nearly no transaction fees. A number of traders and analysts have high hopes for the coin, especially after it recently crossed above the $250 threshold. Reaching $400 A number of analysts predict that Solana’s consistent upward trend may allow it to reach $400 in the next one to one and a half years. This development will most likely be the driving force behind this development as interest in the DeFi and NFT industries is on the rise alongside general blockchain awareness. Working with top-notch distributed apps (dApps), extending utility, and increasing institutional interest will give the required impetus to reach this goal. Rising to $600 Reaching $600 calls for consistent expansion, more acceptance, and favorable macroeconomic conditions in the cryptocurrency market. With more developers on Solana's platform and users swarming to its network because of low fees and great efficiency, Solana's ecosystem might mature greatly by 2025. These elements line up such that $600 is a reasonable target. The 1,000 Milestone Dollar Reaching $1,000 will rely on Solana's capacity to develop globally, keep its technological advantage, and beat competitors. Within five to seven years, Solana can fulfill its ambitious target if it can confirm its preferred blockchain for businesses and distributed apps. Still, extrinsic elements, including market rules, world financial stability, and developments by rival blockchains,s will also be quite important. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Star That Might Multiply a Portfolio By 5,000%? Although Solana is still a favorite among long-term investors, Rexas Finance (RXS) presents another with great growth potential. Unlike speculative cryptocurrencies, Rexas Finance is based on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization—a ground-breaking idea combining blockchain technology with conventional assets, including real estate, commodities, and collectibles. Rexas Finance: Original Characteristics Real-world tokenizing of assets Rexas Finance allows fractional ownership of real-world assets, democratizing access to investments meant for high-net-worth people. The platform gives a worldwide audience liquidity and access by converting real-world assets into digital currencies. QuickMint Bot, Rexas Rexas Finance stands out in part for its QuickMint Bot, which streamlines token creation and management. Combining Telegram and Discord, this bot lets users—even nontechnical ones—easily tokenize assets. Verified Security CertiK Rexas Finance prioritizes investor security since CertiK, a top blockchain security company, guarantees a complete audit of its smart contracts. This raises the platform's legitimacy in the blockchain ecosystem and gives consumers peace of mind. Visibility and Accessibility Rexas Finance has gained more interest from retail and institutional investors after recent CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko listings. Future tier-one exchange listing plans will improve the token's liquidity and accessibility even more. Future Prospect and Presale Development The presale of Rexas Finance has shown amazing popularity. At $0.125 right now in stage 9, the RXS token is valued; the next stage will raise this to $0.150. The presale, which highlights notable investor confidence in the project, has raised $21 million. Early investors stand to benefit from a minimum return of 60% at launch on a predicted listing price of $0.20. Real-world uses of the token and expanding ecosystem offer long-term development possibilities. Demand for RXS will probably rise as more assets become tokenized and traded on the platform, raising its value. A $1 Million Giveaway Program Rexas Finance has started an interesting $1 million offer to involve its community and draw fresh customers. Twenty winners of this campaign can earn $50,000 in RXS tokens. Completing tasks connected to platforms and referring others allows participants to earn entries, driving user growth and community involvement in the campaign. Conclusion Solana is a good investment with the potential to reach $1,000, but Rexas Finance provides an alternative for people looking for more growth possibilities in a less time span. Rexas Finance is creating a niche in the blockchain by tackling practical problems with asset tokenization. Its potential as a transforming agent in the crypto scene is shown by its QuickMint Bot, CertiK-audited security, and presale success. Whether you choose Solana for its scalability or Rexas Finance for its creativity, the crypto industry presents several chances for investors to profit from the following wave of blockchain development.

37289354,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390127,1733489363,Michael Saylor on Bitcoin’s Volatility: Could an 80% Crash Happen Again?,"The post Michael Saylor on Bitcoin’s Volatility: Could an 80% Crash Happen Again? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Michael Saylor, executive chairman of MicroStrategy and a well-known Bitcoin supporter, recently addressed the possibility of an 80% drop in Bitcoin’s value by the end of its current cycle. While Saylor considers this scenario unlikely, he acknowledged that it cannot be entirely ruled out. Speaking with Yahoo Finance , he reflected on Bitcoin’s history of steep corrections and shared his perspective on the current market conditions. Could Bitcoin Face Another Major Crash? Saylor highlighted Bitcoin’s past cycles, particularly the dramatic decline from $66,000 to $16,000 in 2022—a sharp 80% drop. He explained that these corrections were triggered by the collapse of poorly managed companies like FTX, Celsius, and Genesis, which caused widespread instability in the market. However, Saylor noted that today’s market is stronger, with fewer weak players that could spark such a crash. Still, he cautioned that Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle often includes significant corrections after market peaks, which remains a factor to watch. MicroStrategy’s Big Bet on Bitcoin MicroStrategy , under Saylor’s leadership, has built a reputation for its bold Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The company buys Bitcoin regularly, regardless of price, using funds raised through debt and issuing shares. As of December 2024, MicroStrategy owns 402,100 BTC, purchased at an average price of $58,219. On $BTC 100K Day, my discussion with @JulesHyman covered advice to @stoolpresidente , cyber-manhattan, the need for a digital assets framework, the emergence of #Bitcoin as the world reserve capital network, and the logic of a US Strategic #Bitcoin Reserve. pic.twitter.com/XG9uChRap8 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 6, 2024 This approach has brought significant rewards. Saylor revealed that the company’s Bitcoin holdings have delivered a 63.3% return to shareholders, generating approximately $12.3 billion in profits. He described MicroStrategy as the “most profitable and fastest-growing company on the Bitcoin Standard.” Bitcoin’s dramatic price swings have everyone talking—read our Bitcoin price prediction to find out what’s next for the crypto king! Risks of Betting Big on Bitcoin Despite these impressive gains, MicroStrategy’s strategy comes with risks. The company has taken on $4.57 billion in debt to fund its Bitcoin purchases. If Bitcoin were to experience another major downturn, similar to past cycles, it could severely impact the company’s financial health. Still, Saylor continues to believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. He has been buying Bitcoin for his holdings as well, showing his commitment to the cryptocurrency even in uncertain times. Only time will reveal if history repeats or if this cycle charts a new path—but Saylor is ready for either outcome. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37289173,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311739,1733489124,‘God Candle Loading’: Top Analyst Says Retail Investors Primed To Trigger Rally in One Dogecoin Competitor,"A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is leaning bullish on the second-largest memecoin by market capitalization. The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 302,600 followers on the social media platform X that a “god candle”, a massive candlestick denoting a rapid and sustained upward price action, is loading for Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) as the Dogecoin ( DOGE ) rival attempts to break above a resistance level that has been in place since March. “shib god candle loading” Source: Bluntz/X The widely followed analyst further says , “I’m convinced retail [investing crowd] is going to pump SHIB when the meme bid comes back because it’s a dinosaur coin that they still have in their wallets from last cycle.” SHIB is trading at $0.0000316 at time of writing. Against its Bitcoin ( BTC ) pair, Bluntz says that Shiba Inu is in a “bargain basement pricing” zone. Source: Bluntz/X The analyst is also leaning bullish on Dogecoin. According to the analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, Dogecoin has formed a five-wave pattern on the four-hour chart of its US dollar pair and the eight-hour chart of its Bitcoin pair. Per the Elliott Wave theory, the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. “This is the last chance to get a good entry on DOGE before the breakout, all waves within triangle accounted for on USD and BTC pair. Don’t say you weren’t warned.” Source: Bluntz/X Dogecoin is trading at 0.00000430 BTC ($0.436) at time of writing.

37289358,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623708,1733488901,The Trump market a month in – Here’s everything that has changed,"Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential election win has spurred significant market activity across several industries. The S&P 500 surged over 5%, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin reached new all-time high levels. Small-cap stocks, spurred by a domestic growth agenda, have also shown signs of gaining value long-term. In a global market surge analysts have termed the “Trump market,” Tesla’s stock has skyrocketed by nearly 50%. Tesla’s stock price uptick was largely fueled by its CEO Elon Musk’s ties to the new administration. On the crypto end, Bitcoin (BTC), which achieved a new high of $73,000 hours after Trump was announced the victor, has now broken past the $100,000 mark, gaining 34% since the election. Moreover, investors have channeled nearly $140 billion into U.S. equity funds following Donald Trump’s November 5 victory. Data from EPFR indicates $139.5 billion in inflows, making November the busiest month for U.S. equity fund investments since records began in 2000. Source: X The influx of U.S. equity funds has propelled major stock indices to new record highs. Traders are seemingly overlooking concerns about potential inflationary risks from Trump’s proposed policies, including higher tariffs, which could complicate the Federal Reserve’s plans for future rate cuts. Mixed signals from stocks, labor markets, and Treasury yields According to a Financial Times report , emerging market stocks, excluding China, remained subdued amid a stronger dollar and rising Treasury yields. However, stock market analysts believe fears of a possible trade war have caused commodities like oil and copper to weaken. Meanwhile, Treasury yields stayed close to pre-election levels, confounding expectations of inflationary pressure from Trump’s policies. Five-year inflation forecasts also held steady, suggesting there’s growing skepticism from investors over Trump’s predicted aggressive fiscal changes. In the labor market, challenges emerged as job growth slowed. November saw 146,000 new jobs added, down from October’s 184,000, a 20% downtick over a period of 30 days. U.S. stocks have significantly outpaced global markets, particularly Europe, with the tech sector playing a pivotal role in this outperformance. Bank of America analysts have labeled this trend as the “American exceptionalism” trade, driven by expectations of pro-business policies. Trump’s market-friendly stance, including promises of tax cuts and deregulation, has led to short-term stock surges. However, financial experts reckon the market’s continued growth hinges on his ability to reduce regulatory burdens, particularly those imposed under President Biden. Crypto market outlook post-US elections Since Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. Presidential election, the cryptocurrency market has seen significant gains, with notable surges in Bitcoin and some altcoins. According to Coingecko data , the global crypto market cap has soared by over 40% in the last 30 days. The real standout performance has been Ripple (XRP), which saw a massive 375% increase post-election. Ripple Labs has been vocal about its optimism about Trump’s administration, citing his pro-crypto stance and a possible shift in regulatory policies. XRP’s price soared from around $0.55 to over $2, with its market cap reaching a high of $139 billion. The crypto’s excellent performance is tied to anticipated regulatory clarity under Trump, which may have a positive impact on Ripple’s continuing legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cryptocurrencies like Solana and other smaller tokens profited from the increased market optimism following the election. New tokens, such as Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), have increased by more than 1,000% since its inception. The general market sentiment indicates that traders are counting on favorable regulations and increased usage of cryptocurrency technologies under the next administration.

37288799,https://finbold.com/?p=217202,1733488255,Prediction markets set Bitcoin price for year-end,"Though Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) journey between December 4 and December 6 proved something of a round trip , the temporary surge toward $104,000 appears to have turned investors – and gamblers – decisively bullish. Specifically, the community active on the Kalshi prediction market – one of the two that rose to fame ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election – appears confident that BTC will hit a new all-time high (ATH) in the remaining weeks of the year. Specifically, the platform is, at press time on December 6, forecasting Bitcoin will stand at a high $127,000 on New Year’s Eve. Bitcoin price prediction for the end of 2024. Source: Kalshi Can Bitcoin reach $127,000 before the end of 2024? Though the target might appear so lofty that it is out of reach, it is worth pointing out that it would represent a 29.28% rise from the press time price of $98,235 and that the world’s premier cryptocurrency rocketed 31.96% in the last 30 days. If December 5 highs are taken as an endpoint, Bitcoin’s total 30-day upswing amounted to 48.43%, making 29.28% more plausible. While the raw figures certainly paint BTC’s rise to $127,000 as plausible, the coin’s historical performance demonstrates why the likelihood of the move remains doubtful. Specifically, the cryptocurrency has been following a pattern of rallies followed by corrections that are themselves followed by a series of retestings of recent highs. So far, this pattern has mostly led to protracted periods of sideways trading with periodic and temporary downward shocks. Why Bitcoin might trade sideways by the start of 2025 For example, after hitting $73,000 in March, Bitcoin quickly corrected toward $60,000 before finding its footing in the volatile range between $60,000 and $70,000. Furthermore, BTC remained in this range until November, with the most significant shifts coming when the stable levels changed downward from about $67,000 to $63,000. While more recent trading has been more dynamic, this behavior can also be seen in the last 30 days. The coin rapidly rocketed toward $99,000 after November 6 but sustained a strong uptrend for about two weeks before finding a new center of gravity just above $95,000. It is possible but not confirmed at press time that this stable footing shifted upward and closer to $98,000. BTC technical analysis Technical analysis ( TA ) similarly demonstrates the prevalent uncertainty. Bitcoin’s relative strength index ( RSI ) stands just above 64, meaning the cryptocurrency is neither particularly ‘overbought’ nor ‘oversold.’ Still, with the ‘overbought’ zone beginning at 70, it is evident why the move above $100,000 proved brief. Finally, the watershed moment for Bitcoin in December could come soon. Should BTC break above its nearest resistance levels just above $102,000 – and particularly should it sustain the price – another strong rally would become highly likely. Additionally, a breach of the more distant resistance at $111,000 would significantly bolster the case for a rise to $127,000. It is also worth pointing out that the bullish case is further bolstered by the holidays at the end of the month since the decrease in volume could lead to greater price swings. Simultaneously, a significant drop is unlikely as Bitcoin has, so far, successfully held above the nearest support near $92,000, indicating a correction down toward $86,000 is improbable, though not impossible, in 2024. BTC price today Whatever Bitcoin’s final 2024 price ends up being, the cryptocurrency has done remarkably well since the year started. For example, even if the 4.11% 24-hour drop is included, BTC remains 1.46% in the green in the last 7 days. BTC 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold Additionally, zooming out to the year-to-date (YTD) chart demonstrates why the memes depicting joy over Bitcoin reaching a certain price on one day and then despair 24 hours later once it falls to the exact same value have become so popular. Indeed, BTC is 130.02% in the green in 2024.

In a December 6 statement, AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas emphasized the need for stricter oversight in the sector, citing the increasing appeal of cryptocurrency for illicit activities. AUSTRAC Targets AML Non-Compliance “Crypto ATMs offer criminals an accessible channel to launder money due to their widespread availability and the instant, irreversible nature of transactions,” said Thomas. The agency plans to establish a dedicated task force in 2025 to ensure compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws across the industry. The task force will enforce compliance with existing regulations requiring crypto ATM operators to register with AUSTRAC, conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, monitor transactions, and report suspicious activities. Operators are also obligated to submit reports for cash transactions exceeding AU$10,000 (approximately $6,500 USD). Non-compliance could result in hefty penalties, including fines up to AU$158,400 or 12 years in prison. For laundering amounts over AU$1 million, penalties increase to AU$333,000 and up to 25 years of imprisonment. Australia Becomes a Crypto ATM Hotspot Australia has rapidly become a major hub for Bitcoin ATMs , ranking third globally. According to Coin ATM Radar, the country boasts 1,302 crypto ATMs as of December 2024, a significant jump from just 67 in August 2022. This growth outpaces traditional strongholds in Asia, including countries like China, Japan, and Singapore. This exponential rise in crypto ATMs coincided with increased private-sector investment starting in late 2022. By April 2023, Australia had more crypto ATMs than the entirety of Asia. Leading providers like Coinflip, Localcoin, and Cryptolink collectively operate hundreds of machines, making Australia a key player in the global crypto landscape. Despite this growth, AUSTRAC revealed that only a fraction of its 400 registered digital currency exchanges also operate crypto ATMs. The agency aims to address potential risks posed by this discrepancy, prioritizing enforcement actions against high-risk and non-compliant operations. As crypto adoption accelerates in Australia, AUSTRAC’s initiative underscores the challenges of balancing financial innovation with robust regulation .

37288770,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658143,1733488224,Ethereum To Pull A BTC 2021-Like Rally? Analyst Shares Massive Prediction,"As Bitcoin finally soars above the long-awaited $100,000 milestone, Ethereum (ETH) attempts to break out from a key resistance zone. The second-largest crypto rally has fueled optimism about its targets, with some suggesting that it could mimic BTC’s 2020-2021 rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Crashes 33% In South Korea Amid Increasing Political Turmoil Ethereum Reclaims $3,900 Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recorded a 10% surge in the past week, moving from the $3,500 mark to the $3,900 resistance. On Wednesday, the King of Altcoins surpassed the $3,800 level for the first time in six months and continued climbing to retest the $3,900 resistance, not seen since early March. In the early hours of Thursday, ETH turned this key zone into support, briefly dipping to $3,860 before jumping back to the recently reclaimed level. As the cryptocurrency nears its yearly high of $4,093, sentiment around the token’s short-term performance has turned extremely bullish. Ethereum is retesting a massive multi-year resistance zone, which could send ETH to a new ATH. According to analyst Alex Clay, the cryptocurrency attempts to break “through the Key Resistance Zone on the weekly timeframe.” ETH has rested the key zone five times since 2021, facing rejection from the upper resistance at $3,950 on four occasions before. However, Ethereum broke past this level in late 2021, when it hit its all-time high (ATH) and held above it for nearly three months. The analyst noted that if the King of Altcoins successfully breaks above this level and turns it into support, it will be the next “to break through” and smash its ATH. Clay added that he sees “no major pullback in the near time.” Similarly, crypto analyst Jelle stated that if Ethereum breaks above the March high, “all bets are off,” suggesting that the chances of ETH taking a long consolidation period before a new ATH like BTC did were “very low.” ETH To Rally Toward $10,000? Jelle also noted that Ethereum’s current setup mimicked Bitcoin’s in July 2020. Per the chart, Bitcoin broke through a multi-year downtrend line by mid-2020, followed by a massive 500% 10-month rally toward the $60,000 mark in April 2021. The analyst noted that ETH breached the multi-year trendline today, like BTC in 2020, which could trigger a similar rally toward new highs in the next few months. He added that investors are “in for a treat if this plays out anything similar.” In another post, he highlighted that Ethereum started rallying when Bitcoin broke its ATH and entered price discovery when BTC traded nearly 100% above its previous cycle high. Related Reading: Tron (TRX) Leads The Crypto Market With 100% Rally To New ATH, $0.5 Next? He considers that it would be surprising to “see things play out similarly this time around. BTC & ETH climbing in tandem, leading to ETH entering price discovery somewhere around ±$130,000.” Based on this, the analyst believes that a 150-200% rally toward the $10,000-$12,000 price range for the cryptocurrency is possible for this cycle. As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,905, a 2.4% increase in the daily timeframe.

37289655,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317659,1733488158,WikiLeaks’ Afghan War Logs to Be Permanently Archived on Bitcoin Blockchain,"Julian Assange’s monumental 2010 release of the Afghan War Logs marked a turning point in transparency, revealing classified details of US military operations during the Afghanistan War. According to a recent report by The Block, a new initiative now aims to ensure these records remain permanently accessible by inscribing them onto the Bitcoin blockchain via Project Spartacus. This ambitious effort involves encoding 76,911 files from the Afghan War Diary into Bitcoin’s decentralized ledger, utilizing the Ordinals protocol to safeguard the data against censorship or loss. Assange’s supporters and family spearheaded the move as part of WikiLeaks’ mission and its long-standing relationship with Bitcoin as a tool for resilience. WikiLeaks’ Afghan War Logs: How Can Bitcoin Blockchain Guarantee Immortability? Source: Screenshot from WikiLeaks The Afghan War Logs , first released by WikiLeaks in 2010, provide a detailed account of military operations between 2004 and 2010. They expose troubling aspects of the war, including civilian casualties and controversial interrogation practices. Despite public availability, there remains a persistent risk of suppression or erasure due to the politically sensitive nature of the content. To address this, Project Spartacus will inscribe the logs onto the Bitcoin blockchain using OrdinalsBot to ensure permanence. Unlike traditional digital storage, which relies on centralized servers, Bitcoin’s decentralized network distributes data across thousands of nodes globally, making it nearly impossible to alter or delete. Gabriel Shipton, Assange’s brother and chair of the Assange Campaign, remarked: “This information should last forever.” The minting process, set to begin on December 12, 2024, will be free for participants via ProjectSpartacus.org and later continue on the OrdinalsBot marketplace, Trio. Given the volume of data, the mint is expected to span multiple Bitcoin blocks, creating one of the most extensive and technically complex blockchain projects to date. A Symbol of Resistance and Legacy Bitcoin played a crucial role in supporting WikiLeaks during its financial blockade, during which major payment processors denied service to the organization. Donations in BTC kept WikiLeaks operational and proved decentralized systems’ resilience in the face of state-level suppression. Assange’s early engagement with Bitcoin even drew attention from Satoshi Nakamoto , the cryptocurrency’s enigmatic creator. In 2010, Nakamoto expressed concern over WikiLeaks’ use of Bitcoin, fearing it could bring unwelcome scrutiny to the nascent technology. Nakamoto wrote in a Bitcointalk forum post: “WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.” Despite this initial hesitancy, Bitcoin became a lifeline for WikiLeaks as a tool for censorship-resistant currency. A “Forever Iconic” Endeavor Using the Ordinals protocol makes it easy and the best option to permanently archive the logs. Ordinals allow data to be inscribed onto individual satoshis—the smallest unit of Bitcoin—creating immutable records directly tied to the network’s ledger. Toby Lewis, founder of OrdinalsBot, described the project as a “forever iconic” endeavor. However, he acknowledged the challenges posed by the scale of the mint, which involves tens of thousands of files. Lewis noted: “This isn’t a 10K collection.” He added that the infrastructure is designed for large-scale mints but still anticipates some delays. While the initiative is not intended to raise funds for Assange— who continues to seek a full pardon from U.S. President Joe Biden —it provides a way for supporters to engage with his legacy. Shipton emphasized that the project serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s original purpose, to be a weapon against systemic constraints. “It’s one of the strengths of Bitcoin — being able to withstand resist state-level attacks and keep publishing.” The post WikiLeaks’ Afghan War Logs to Be Permanently Archived on Bitcoin Blockchain appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/wikileaks-afghan-war-logs-to-be-permanently-archived-on-bitcoin-blockchain/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37289655.jpeg

With Bitcoin’s price up 45% over the same time period, most of the crypto altcoin market is also trading hot. Many top coins by market cap are periodically melting up the way, but Kaia coin dominated the start of December, with a surge to a new all-time high at $0.4 Big Support for ALGO Web3 ID Layer Meanwhile, Kaia is a popular trade in the current 30-day window because it’s one of the biggest players in the GameFi and MetaVerse ID layer for Web3. At the same time, cryptocurrency exchanges have markedly highlighted this segment of the blockchain. In addition to Kaia, Algorand (ALGO) prices were ahead by an astounding 86% on the 7-day window and 400% on the 1-month range. The foundation behind ALGO recently released a new decentralized identifier solution (DID). Markets are pumped about that and the overall prospect of transparently anonymous Internet users being able to stash their important data in the security and reliability of the blockchain and then retrieve it quickly and affordably when they’re ready to use it.

In a recent notice , Binance announced listings for Across Protocol and Orca native tokens on the exchange. Open trading for ACX and ORCA spot trading pairs will be available to traders starting Dec. 6 13:00 UTC. The spot trading pairs featured on Binance will be ACX/USDT and ORCA/USDT. Withdrawals will be available the day after open trading starts, specifically on Dec. 7 at 13:00 UTC. Though, Binance informed that it will apply seed tags to the aforementioned tokens upon listing. Seed tags are used by Binance to signify relatively new projects that may carry higher volatility and risk compared to other tokens on the exchange. Shortly after the announcement was posted, both tokens saw a significant jump in their prices. According to data from CoinGecko , bridge platform Across Protocol’s token saw a leap of around 147% after its Binance ( BNB ) listing was announced, reaching an all time high of $1.44.

Additionally, the token’s trading volume increased by 2,227% compared to the previous day of trading, indicating that more traders were drawn to the token after the Binance announcement. The Binance listing also had the same effect on ORCA, the native token of Orca, a Solana ( SOL ) decentralized exchange. ORCA’s price went up by nearly 90% within 24 hours of trading. Though unlike ACX, it did not reach a new all-time high. At the time of writing, ORCA is currently trading hands at $7.74. ORCA has a market cap of $379 million and a fully diluted valuation of $718 million. The Orca token’s trading volume went up by 1,933% compared to the previous day of trading. As the tokens are marked with seed tags, users will need to answer quizzes about the Binance Spot and Binance Margin platforms and accept the crypto exchange’s terms of use every 90 days to gain trading access to ACX and ORCA.

When token unlocks happen, most of the time, prices take a big hit. In fact, about 90% of unlock events result in price declines, data compiled by market maker Keyrock reveals. The analysis, which examined over 16,000 token unlocks, reveals that weekly unlocks result in $600 million worth of new tokens entering the market, a significant factor in price fluctuations. “Across the 16,000 unlock events we analyzed, a striking pattern emerged: unlocks of all types, sizes, and recipients are almost always negative for price. This highlights the importance of keeping track of unlock schedules and understanding their implications, especially for traders aiming to time the market effectively.” Keyrock The study suggests that despite overall market conditions, it is the surge in token supply that most often triggers these price drops. For instance, during a team unlock, which releases tokens held by the project’s team or early investors, the market faces heavy selling pressure as these stakeholders liquidate their holdings.

These stakeholders often employ hedging strategies like over-the-counter sales or options, minimizing market disruption. “VC and investor unlocks are not the primary drivers of price declines,” the report notes, emphasizing that these participants align with long-term protocol goals. Keyrock analysts noted that tying ecosystem unlocks to growth initiatives can boost liquidity and drive adoption, presenting potential opportunities.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA.

37288445,https://invezz.com/?p=2373098,1733487202,Australia targets illegal crypto ATM operators with new regulatory task force,"Regulators in Australia are stepping up oversight of the cryptocurrency sector with a new task force aimed at cracking down on illegal crypto ATM operators. According to a recent statement from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the agency has created an internal task force to oversee crypto ATM operators and crack down on those who fail to comply with local mandates. Australia has witnessed an uptick in cryptocurrency-related crimes, with bad actors exploiting the anonymity and rapid transaction capabilities of digital assets. These crimes range from money laundering and fraud to the use of money mules in facilitating illicit activities, according to intelligence data cited by AUSTRAC. Notably, criminals often misuse crypto ATMs, which AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas described as “attractive avenues for criminals” due to their accessibility and ability to facilitate instant and irreversible transfers. Such activities are expected to increase as crypto adoption grows, Thomas noted, stating: We’re seeing too many Australians falling victim to scams carried out through cryptocurrency, and we’ve heard of some victims losing their life savings, which is just heartbreaking. As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so too will criminal exploitation. To minimize these risks, over the next year, the task force will work to ensure that crypto ATM operators comply with Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. This includes verifying that operators are registered with AUSTRAC, conducting thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, and reporting large cash deposits or withdrawals exceeding AUD 10,000 (approximately $6400). Failure to comply with these requirements would lead to “significant financial penalties,” Thomas continued, emphasizing that “AUSTRAC won’t hesitate in taking action.” “This is the first step in AUSTRAC’s focus to reduce the criminal use of cryptocurrency in Australia,” he added. Australia currently ranks third globally in the number of crypto ATMs, with data from Coin ATM Radar indicating a total of 1,308 machines, with Sydney and Melbourne hosting the highest numbers. However, the agency claims that only a small fraction of these machines are operated by registered operators. Australia is keeping the crypto sector in check Australia remains cautious of the crypto sector and has time and again issued warnings about the various risks involved with this rapidly expanding asset class. Earlier this year, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) warned about the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies ahead of the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). ASIC has also been going after crypto companies, which it believes have been offering unregistered securities. Meanwhile, in its 2024 risk assessment report, AUSTRAC flagged cryptocurrencies as a “high-risk” tool that could promote money laundering activities. Australia’s strict stance on cryptocurrencies comes as the nation has witnessed a surge in crypto crimes . An August report from the Australian Federal Police found that locals lost over AUD$180 million to crypto investment scams in just 12 months.

37288209,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390094,1733487152,Here are the Crucial Levels to Watch for the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally If Bears Continue to Dominate,"The post Here are the Crucial Levels to Watch for the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally If Bears Continue to Dominate appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the price of Bitcoin marked the much-awaited highs, the market participants seemed to have become delighted. The buying pressure that elevated the levels beyond $100K appears to have turned into a selling pressure. Therefore, after a tough fight, the bears successfully dragged the levels below $98,000. The buying volume does not appear to have substantiated the selling pressure and as a result, the BTC price may go lower and test the pivotal support shortly. The BTC price was expected to undergo a retracement after rising above the much-awaited milestone of $100K. As almost all the BTCs were in profits, the probability of a spot price reversal was much less. Meanwhile, the data from Coinglass shows that the traders had leveraged huge long positions across $100K to $103K, which have been liquidated. As a result, the price has faced a significant pullback. More than $400 million in longs were liquidated, which is said to be one of the largest liquidations in the past few months. With this, the leverage seems to have whipped out to a large extent, paving the way for a healthy upswing. Currently, the price remains above the crucial demand zone, just below $97,000 and as long as the token remains within the range, the possibility of marching towards upper resistance remains high. Mainly because a massive amount of BTCs were bought around this range. As per the data shared by an analyst, ALI , more than 1.42 million BTCs were bought by 1.45 million addresses around the range of $95,043 and $97,899. Hence, these can be considered as one of the strongest support levels at present and as long as bulls defend them, the probability of a rebound continues to hover over the BTC price rally. Therefore, the Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to remain within a bullish range regardless of the bears offering strong upward pressure, trying to send the levels lower.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/here-are-the-crucial-levels-to-watch-for-the-bitcoin-btc-price-rally-if-bears-continue-to-dominate/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

However, some cryptocurrencies are showing indications that they are perhaps reaching a top. Is this the case for Sui ($SUI), Aptos ($APT) and Near Protocol ($NEAR)? $SUI reaches its cup and handle measured move Source: TradingView The $SUI price has been on the up for some time now. Breaking out of a cup and handle formation earlier in November, the price has since reached its measured move at $4.15. After surpassing this level, the price has been quickly sold back down, leaving a couple of small candle wicks behind. It remains to be seen whether this will now become support, or whether the price might come back down - perhaps all the way to retest the 1.618 at $3.25. If there is continuation of the upside move, and in all probability there probably is room for this, the 2.618 Fibonacci is a target above at $5. Major resistance approaching for $APT Source: TradingView On the weekly chart for $APT, it can be seen that the price is rising towards $16 after hopefully being able to hold above the 0.618 Fibonacci at $13.58. Given that there is a descending trendline that is coinciding with the 0.786 Fibonacci, there is likely to be a lot of resistance at this level. $NEAR needs to get above its next price step Source: TradingView The $NEAR price has broken out of the long-time descending trendline that began in early 2022. In the weekly chart above, it can be noted that some nice price structure has been built. Two price steps now exist at $5.65 and $8.53. It’s this next step at $8.53 that $NEAR bulls need to lift the price above. This could then act as support for the rest of the bull market. However, the Stochastic RSI has reached its top on the weekly time frame, and therefore upward price momentum could start to dissipate, and a rejection at the 0.382 Fibonacci could be the upshot. The weekly RSI is at the top for not just the three cryptocurrencies mentioned in this article, but also for most other cryptocurrencies. This is something to bear in mind, and there is likely to be a correction coming at some point. Stay alert. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37287804,https://crypto.news/?p=14316703,1733486460,US voters gave a ‘pro-crypto’ mandate—what happens now? | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. After years of regulatory uncertainty and a flurry of enforcement actions, US voters have delivered a resounding message: the time has come for a new approach to crypto regulation. This sentiment has been echoed across both executive and legislative branches, with over 292 candidates who openly support crypto elected to the legislature. This wave of pro-crypto leadership has ignited cautious optimism within the industry, bolstered by a post-election surge in institutional and retail adoption. You might also like: Blockchain tech can restore trust in US elections | Opinion If the incoming administration fulfils its pre-election promises , the US could position itself again as a global hub for crypto innovation. However, the path forward is not without challenges. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation , set to take effect on December 30, will introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework, potentially outpacing the US in offering clarity to crypto businesses. To maintain its leadership, the US must seize this moment to craft a regulatory framework that strikes a delicate balance: one that fosters innovation while safeguarding consumers and investors. This will require moving beyond the reactive, enforcement-first strategies of the past and embracing a more proactive, principles-based approach. The turning point Since 2017, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has largely relied on enforcement actions to address perceived regulatory gaps in the crypto industry. This approach, while well-intentioned, has contributed to significant uncertainty. In 2023 alone, the SEC initiated 46 enforcement actions—a 53% increase from the previous year—further highlighting the inadequacy of applying legacy financial regulations to this rapidly evolving space. Recent proposals, such as granting the Federal Reserve authority over stablecoin issuers as ‘depository institutions,’ demonstrate the tension between traditional regulatory frameworks and crypto’s unique characteristics. Stablecoins like Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) thrive on their flexibility and global reach, attributes that don’t neatly align with the requirements of traditional banking regulations. Fortunately, the outcome of the recent elections suggests a shift in public sentiment. Voters are signalling a preference for regulatory clarity and more constructive dialogue between lawmakers and the crypto industry. Momentum for change One of the most notable shifts occurred in Ohio, where incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown, known for his critical stance on crypto, was unseated by Republican Bernie Moreno. Backed by industry heavyweights like Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Andreessen Horowitz, Moreno’s campaign underscored the growing influence of the crypto sector in shaping political outcomes. With SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s tenure coming to an end in January, new leadership at the agency offers some hope for a fresh approach, especially after the news that Trump picked pro-crypto and former federal regulator Paul Atkins to serve as SEC chair . Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, remarked that this is America’s most pro-crypto Congress ever. This optimism is justified, as Congress appears poised to revisit critical legislation like the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act ( DCCPA ). If passed, this bill could grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a more prominent role in overseeing digital asset markets, reducing the SEC’s outsized influence and providing much-needed regulatory clarity. Balancing innovation and regulation While the promise of pro-crypto legislation is encouraging, lawmakers must tread carefully to avoid the pitfalls of overregulation. For example, the EU’s MiCA framework has drawn criticism for its “ systemic risks ” and the potential to stifle innovation by imposing stringent requirements on certain crypto assets and markets. Similarly, recent moves by French regulators to clamp down on prediction markets, such as Polymarket, underscore the risks of applying outdated regulatory models to innovative technologies. Such actions, while aimed at investor protection, may inadvertently hamper market growth and limit consumer choice. The goal for the US should be a regulatory regime that promotes innovation, encourages competition, and facilitates market access for startups and larger institutions. By fostering an environment of trust and transparency, lawmakers can protect consumers without stifling the entrepreneurial spirit that drives the crypto industry forward. A bright but uncertain future With a historic pro-crypto mandate, the US is at a pivotal moment. The opportunity to reclaim its position as a global leader in financial innovation is within reach, but the path ahead remains to be determined. Success will depend on the willingness of lawmakers and regulators to embrace collaboration, prioritize clarity, and foster an ecosystem that balances innovation with robust consumer protections. As this new chapter unfolds, one thing is clear: the future of crypto in America holds immense potential. Whether that potential is realized will depend on the actions taken in the months and years to come.

42390030,9564eaf4-142e-4566-b160-ac9db2ebb357,1733486400,Crypto Daybook Americas: It's Glass Half Full Despite Record Short Bitcoin ETF Volume,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  You know how it feels when you're watching a match, both teams score and you end up with a draw? So, that's the bitcoin market right now.  The bulls pushed prices above $103,000 early Thursday, only for the bears to bite back, crashing prices to $91,000. As it stands, we’re trading steadily around $98,000. Talk about undecided ...  The crash shook out leveraged crypto futures bets worth around $1 billion, bringing a degree of normality to what had become an overheated market. That's possibly a blessing in disguise, because had BTC surged all the way up to $120,000, the eventual leverage shakeout would have been even more severe and could have potentially damaged investor confidence.  The glass-half-full perspective is supported by bitcoin spot ETFs, which managed to pull in a net $766 million despite the chaos.  But there's a glass-half-empty side too. The ProShares Ultra Short Bitcoin ETF, which tracks twice the inverse of bitcoin’s daily performance, also saw a net inflow as well as record trading volume. While the $7 million added is small compared with the long spot ETFs, it shows the bears are ready to make their presence felt.  If it all feels a little shaky, there's more to come, with the chance of downside volatility if U.S. nonfarm payrolls data points to a resilient labour market and sticky wage pressures. That would prompt a recalibration of Fed rate-cut expectations and possibly hurt crypto prices. Weak data, conversely, could yield a price bounce, although trading directionally might be tricky while prices are this indecisive.  In other news, President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of David Sacks as Crypto and AI Czar (which might seem like the opposite of crypto’s decentralization ethos) is being viewed positively for Solana’s ETF prospects. Why? Because at one point, Sacks was associated with the crypto hedge fund Multicoin, one of Solana's early investors. It seems farfetched, but hey it's a typical bull-market narrative.  Looking at the broader market, Hyperliquid’s HYPE token is quickly approaching the $4.6 billion market value of Arbitrum's ARB token in a move that indicates application-specific layer 2s like Hyperliquid are becoming the ""real value capture mechanisms for DeFi applications,"" according to Gautham Santosh, founder of Polynomial Protocol.  Gautham noted on X that building on general-purpose layer 2s could mean constructing someone else's moat, essentially translating your success into their token value. He points out that while Arbitrum-based perpetual protocol GMX generates 54% more revenue than Hyperliquid, its market cap stands at just $376 million or just 8% of Hyperliquid's.  That's a lot to take in for today. So, as trader Alex Kruger said on X, ""If you're not a full-time trader, focus on portfolio construction."" Stay alert out there!

It becomes the second-largest cat-themed token behind Solana-based popcat (POPCAT)  The memecoin is known for its distinctive branding around the meme of a cat laughing with tears (often represented by the ""joycat"" emoji 😹) and sporting Pit Viper sunglasses. This token doesn't boast any intrinsic utility, thriving instead on its community-driven ethos and the virality of meme culture within the cryptocurrency space.  Meme coins often rely on community hype, and MOG has successfully captured a zeitgeist with its humorous and culturally resonant branding driving demand.  Its cult community often appears to 'mog' other token communities (a slang term for outperforming) on social posts or in replies on X — and that has become a meme itself, further fueling the token’s popularity.  Derivatives Positioning  BTC and ETH perpetual funding rates have normalized from previously overheated levels, with the ETH rate remaining elevated compared with BTC, suggesting a bullish bias for the ETH/BTC ratio. The positioning in SOL perpetuals is even more bullish.   The open interest-normalized cumulative volume delta has declined for most major tokens in the past 24 hours, indicating that the sell-off primarily resulted from the unwinding of long positions rather than fresh shorts.   Despite BTC's quick retrace to sub-$100K levels, calls continue to trade at a premium to puts, although the spread is narrower than it was early Thursday.

37287796,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623701,1733486065,Bitcoin (BTC) returns to volatility ahead of first December options expiry,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are headed for their first December weekly options expiry. The event may add to the market volatility, with the distinct possibility of a new direction after the contracts expire. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are preparing for more volatility ahead of the weekly options expiry. The December contracts are already setting the pace for prices at the end of 2024. The expiry arrives at a time when the BTC spot price is volatile in the short term, even though it is showing a recovery trend. BTC rallied again to $98,237.17, while still trading at the ‘greed’ sentiment level. As of December 6, BTC had a weekly options expiry of 23K contracts, with a notional value of $2.3B and maximum pain at $97,000. The put/call ratio of 1.1 suggested a relative balance between long and short positions. ETH options accrued just $570K for the week but with a put/call ratio of 0.62. The ratio suggests a stronger bullish attitude for ETH, as the price approaches $4,000. Even without other factors, trading ahead of weekends and options expiry boosts volatility in the short term. For BTC, options expiry also precedes bigger price rallies. The November expiry of $13.6B in options preceded the recent rally to $104,000. What caused the BTC flash crash to $93,000? The BTC rally ground to a halt as it endured a worrying flash crash to $93,000. The options expiry event may have added to the volatility. The flash crash liquidated up to $450M in leveraged positions. The event continued on Friday, with a total of $1B liquidations of exposed positions. Other explanations include rapid liquidation, as well as normalizing the BTC levels to available liquidity. The selling may be due to relatively large put option positions, which would be liquidated at a lower price range. BTC recovered above $97,000, but may still face price pressures from long positions at a lower price range. One liquidation target holds more than $84M in leveraged positions at $95,322, as well as $73.52M in leveraged positions at $94,011. The recent volatile price moves may not reflect long-term opportunities, but they are still leading to re-estimations on whether BTC can go higher, or if it has already achieved its cycle peak. Options trading also gives an outlook on expected performance. The biggest liquidity of call options can be seen at $100,000, followed by a buildup at the $110,000 and $120,000 levels. Those options point to cautious trading for year-end levels. The most actively traded options expiring on December 27 point to $110,000 as a possible scenario for BTC. | Source: Deribit BTC price moves in December may be swayed even more by the options set to expire on the 27th. One of the biggest contracts with $229M in notional value is a call option at $110,000. For more cautious traders, the $96,000 and $120,000 call options have almost similar volumes, exploring both the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios. Will ETH finally show its bullish side? The bullish options ratio for ETH suggests an expectation for a breakout above $4,000. The $3,600 resistance level has turned into support in the past few days. ETH traders may also attack the accrued short positions, all of which are above the current price. The liquidation heatmap points to $877M in attackable positions. ETH benefitted from highly active ETF inflows reaching an all-time peak. In the past day, ETF inflows expanded to $428.44M, surpassing the last few months of inflows. For now, ETH still lags behind BTC in activity and leveraged liquidity. However, the slowdown of the BTC rally may lead to a rollover into ETH in expectation of a breakout. ETH traded at a spot price of $3,869.86, with trading volumes close to the higher range for the past month. ETH’s performance is also tied to the expectations of an altcoin season, which also involves multiple tokens from the Ethereum ecosystem.

And one has added its own twist by also adding Ripple’s native coin XRP to its balance sheet. Worksport To Incorporate BTC And XRP Into Its Corporate Treasury Worksport, a New York-based company that trades on the Nasdaq and sells pickup truck covers, announced Thursday that it was investing up to 10% of its cash reserves in Bitcoin and XRP. This is equivalent to $5 million. The decision to buy up these two cryptocurrencies is intended to safeguard Worksport’s assets against inflation and to boost transaction efficiency. Worksport CEO Steven Rossi described Bitcoin and XRP as “increasingly reliable stores of value” due to their “inflation-resistant” properties. Apart from adding BTC and XRP to its corporate treasury, the company said it would also accept crypto for payments on its e-commerce platform. Worksport expects a 37% reduction in transaction costs with cryptocurrency payments. $WKSP Worksport To Adopt Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin and XRP for Corporate Treasury.

(@WorksportLtd) December 5, 2024 “By strategically allocating a portion of our treasury to these digital assets and accepting crypto payments, we’re enhancing our financial strategy and aligning ourselves with the future of global finance,” Rossi noted. Why XRP? Worksport joins a growing list of publicly traded companies that have taken the plunge and used excess cash reserves to purchase digital assets this year. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy was the first public company to put BTC on its balance sheet back in 2020, in an effort to accrue the best returns for shareholders instead of holding excess cash. The software firm now holds a staggering 402,100 BTC , worth around $39 billion at the coin’s current market price. However, it’s extremely rare for firms to opt for altcoins such as XRP. Rossi, who has personally invested in XRP, shared his belief in the industry’s third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap during an interview. “XRP has been doing quite well recently, and it reaffirmed that these are early assets that really challenge central banking,” he posited. While XRP has registered some extreme volatility, the Worksport boss believes it’s stabilizing and will bring long-term value. Besides the spectacular price rally, the fact that there’s also a handful of spot XRP exchange-traded fund applications on the SEC’s desk might also make the digital asset more appealing for corporate adoption.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ripples-xrp-to-gain-super-bullish-steam-as-this-publicly-traded-company-buys-xrp-for-corporate-treasury/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

An analyst assessing the state of Bitcoin and XRP has warned of a potential bloodbath in XRP as Bitcoin dominance increases. Pav Hundal, chief analyst at cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx, noted that if Bitcoin dominance continues to grow, XRP could fall and the majority of long positions in XRP could be liquidated. “The real danger for XRP bulls, who are currently heavily leveraged, is a return to Bitcoin dominance. A rotation from XRP to Bitcoin would likely lead to a long liquidation bloodbath.” Stating that investors' expectations for an increase have increased after the incredible rise in XRP, the analyst said that investors are open to long positions even as the XRP price falls. At this point, citing CoinGlass data, the analyst noted that XRP's open interest (OI) reached $ 3.44 billion on December 5, pointing out that this figure is much higher than the $ 2 billion recorded during the price increase in April 2021. Finally, the analyst added that he predicts that spot volumes and prices for XRP and altcoins could increase again once Bitcoin stabilizes and its dominance declines. *This is not investment advice.

In a post on X, Burniske has called for a tempered perspective, advocating profit-taking strategies and a balanced outlook on the crypto market’s trajectory. People won't like me saying this, but if $10T is the round # target, then we likely fall short of it this cycle. It was a good rallying cry from a capitulation bottom, and will prove directionally correct this cycle, only to be exceeded with time. That said, as we enter a… pic.twitter.com/r1y8HE0DQf — Chris Burniske (@cburniske) December 5, 2024 $10T Crypto Market Cap Hype: Should You Be Wary of the Bull Market Frenzy? Reflecting on the 2021 bull market, Burniske highlighted the dangers of inflated expectations, recalling the widespread projections of $100,000 for Bitcoin and $10,000 for Ethereum. Back then, Bitcoin peaked at around $70,000, while Ethereum topped out near $5,000. Those targets, only now being realized for Bitcoin, serve as a cautionary tale for investors swept up in hype. Burniske remarked: “People won’t like me saying this, but if $10T is the round target, then we likely fall short of it this cycle.” While acknowledging the $10 trillion target as “directionally correct” for crypto’s future, he urged investors to remain realistic, cautioning that dreams of astronomical valuations could lead to disappointment this cycle. Burniske’s reflections coincide with Bitcoin’s recent rally past $100,000. The cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $104,000 before retracting to $98,067. The total crypto market cap currently stands at $1.94 trillion, significantly short of the speculative $10 trillion mark. A Pragmatic Approach to Profit-Taking Burniske’s advice centers on strategic profit-taking as valuations climb. He suggested that investors who entered the market when its capitalization was below $1 trillion should consider realizing gains in tranches between $3 trillion and $10 trillion if the latter is approached. Burniske reminded his audience, saying: “No one ever lost money taking profits.” He acknowledged that the psychological pain of missing further upside might deter some but emphasized the wisdom of securing gains during periods of market frenzy. While advocating profit-taking, Burniske encouraged a balanced strategy. He encouraged the well-known “hold for the long-term” strategy, which means retaining some assets for enduring exposure to the market’s future growth. He also reminded investors to avoid perfectionism and that striving for flawless timing often leads to missed opportunities, writing: “Sure hold some coin forever, but also take profits in frenzies and live your life. Time is more precious than even $BTC.” Early Adopters Reflect Burniske’s commentary arrives as market participants grapple with the tension between long-term optimism and short-term caution. While Bitcoin’s crossing of $100,000 marks a milestone, his message was presented as a caution to investors. According to Cryptonews’s detailed analysis of the market reaction , the event sparked widespread celebration across the crypto community. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts view it as a vindication of their long-standing belief in the digital asset’s potential. Early adopters reminisced about their journey through volatility, skepticism, and ridicule, while notable figures like Anthony Pompliano praised the resilience of Bitcoin holders who stayed committed despite setbacks. https://t.co/QVvFbQ7woa pic.twitter.com/WiOAYg6Ztx — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 5, 2024 While nostalgic veterans reflected on how Bitcoin evolved from niche gatherings to a global financial asset, others expressed concerns about whether its growing institutionalization had diluted its core values.

Eric Trump, Donald Trump’s second eldest son , shared a post on X that included a screen grab of the latter’s post on Truth Social. According to the younger Trump, his father, the 45th president of the United States, was ecstatic about the development and claimed credit for it. He then ended it with a typical Make America Great Again Rhetoric. Image Source: X Bitcoin’s Latest Price Action The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization went above $104k in the trading session earlier yesterday but has since dropped below $100k once again. However, one of the biggest and most storeyed price resistances in digital currency history has been subdued, and commentators took a moment to celebrate this occasion. Some called it a watershed moment in the history of the digital currency revolution, while others called it a launchpad for further price action going into 2025. Did Trump Cause Bitcoin to Go Above $100k? Donald Trump loves to take credit for positive developments from around the world. Bitcoin did benefit from Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election, but to say that he is the sole reason or even the biggest one behind the $100k move is highly inaccurate. Trump famously opposed Bitcoin during his 2016-2020 presidency and once compared the premier digital currency to a scam in a 2018 presidential address. He also stated his desire to ban the cryptocurrency in America. However, Bitcoin paid no heed to his threats and continued to grow strongly over time. It was only in 2022 that Trump changed his original position and started courting crypto users and their votes. By then, the blockchain economy had grown to become a huge industry with tens of millions of users in the US. They readily started to support Trump, as the alternative was the Democrats, who wanted to censure the trillion-dollar decentralized economy even further. Trump was one of many factors that helped Bitcoin go above $100k, but the real challenge will be upon him soon. So far, all of his rhetoric has been talking and political point-scoring. It remains to be seen whether he will walk the walk on the matter once he takes oath as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/donald-trump-congratulates-bitcoiners-on-100k-btc-as-250000-bitcoin-price-is-expected-next-year/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

On December 5, 2024, Gill posted a mysterious image on X (formerly Twitter)—an edited Time magazine cover from 2006. This puzzling post triggered a rally in GameStop and AMC stocks, proving Gill’s influence remains strong. pic.twitter.com/tXViICmVFG — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) December 5, 2024 He is no stranger to market-shaking events, having played a key role in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021, where the stock surged over 1,600%, disrupting Wall Street and dealing heavy losses to hedge funds that bet against it. GameStop Stock Surges After Gill’s Post Gill’s post sent GameStop’s stock climbing 16% to $30.87 before it settled at $28.60. Despite this rise, the stock remains 6% down over the past five days. The sharp increase triggered a temporary halt in trading, a clear sign of how strongly the market still reacts to Gill’s posts. Meme stocks like GameStop remain as volatile as ever, with their prices often driven by sentiment rather than fundamentals. AMC Joins the Rally AMC Entertainment, another popular meme stock, also saw a boost, climbing 12% to $5.55. While far from its record high of $261 in 2021, the rally shows that the meme stock movement still holds sway over retail traders. AMC, much like GameStop, has become a symbol of small investors challenging Wall Street, with Gill continuing to play a central role in keeping this narrative alive. Meme Coin Markets Feel the Impact Gill’s influence isn’t limited to stocks. Following his post, an unofficial GameStop-themed memecoin built on the Solana blockchain (GME) jumped 72%, reaching $0.007672 before settling at $0.006488. This surge highlights the speculative nature of the memecoin market and its unique connection to Gill’s online activity. The Return of Roaring Kitty After largely disappearing from the public eye following the 2021 GameStop frenzy, Keith Gill returned to social media in May 2024, reigniting interest in meme stocks and cryptocurrencies. His posts in September and December have shown he still has the power to move markets. However, his actions have also attracted legal scrutiny. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : JasmyCoin Hits New 52-Week High: Will It Target $0.0717 Next? , Legal Challenges In June 2024, a GameStop investor filed a lawsuit against Gill, accusing him of manipulating the stock. The case was dismissed, but it underscored the legal attention his market influence continues to draw. Crypto analyst Evan commented on the curious impact of Gill’s activity, noting how GameStop’s stock rose 5% shortly after his post. He jokingly pointed out that this defies the idea that stock prices should reflect all available information.

37287164,https://finbold.com/?p=217185,1733485199,New store of value? Bitcoin’s dominance over gold hits largest margin in history,"The recent Bitcoin ( BTC ) spike above $100,000 has elevated the asset to outperform gold by the largest margin in history. Specifically, Bitcoin is now valued at 36.78 ounces of gold per BTC, a historic high against the traditional store of value, according to data shared by Barchart on December 6. Bitcoin and gold price performance. Source: Barchart The data indicates that from its early years, Bitcoin’s price trajectory has been marked by volatile but meteoric rises. In contrast, gold’s performance has remained steady and relatively flat over the same period, highlighting its traditional role as a safe-haven asset rather than a high-growth investment . While gold has long been hailed as the ultimate store of value, Bitcoin’s ascent signals a possible paradigm shift in how investors are choosing to preserve wealth. This development lends credence to Bitcoin’s emerging status as ‘digital gold.’ Interestingly, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has highlighted the possibility of Bitcoin outperforming gold, noting that the digital currency is a competitor to gold but not to the dollar. Despite Bitcoin’s rapid growth, the asset significantly trails the precious metal, which boasts a market cap of almost $18 trillion compared to Bitcoin’s $1.9 trillion. Skepticism on Bitcoin replacing gold Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s volatility has led some gold advocates to dismiss its potential as a gold replacement. Economist Peter Schiff, for instance, remains a vocal proponent of gold, emphasizing that Bitcoin is destined to crash to zero. In a November 25 X post , Schiff argued that Bitcoin lacks the intrinsic value needed to serve as a store of value. According to the gold enthusiast, Bitcoin’s appeal is purely speculative, driven by Fear of Missing Out ( FOMO ) and faith rather than fundamentals. He claimed Bitcoin’s rising price relies on attracting more buyers and likened investing in it to a risky game where participants must sell before the bubble bursts. You don't store value by holding #Bitcoin . Unlike #gold , Bitcoin has no actual value to store. Holding Bitcoin is a bet that the price of Bitcoin will continue to rise, as FOMO ensures that more people will buy and have faith in Bitcoin in the future than have faith in it today. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 25, 2024 Unlike gold, which Schiff champions for its tangible value, Bitcoin, he argues, is a bet on momentum rather than a reliable hedge. Conversely, other figures like author and investor Robert Kiyosaki have dismissed the debate between gold and Bitcoin, emphasizing that both asset classes serve the same purpose. For the celebrity financial educator, both can act as a safeguard, especially during his long-projected historic market crash . Gold and Bitcoin price movement Regarding price movements, Bitcoin and gold have had a stellar year. Gold was on track to target the $3,000 mark , but bullish momentum stalled after the United States presidential election. Regarding gold’s outlook, legendary trader Peter Brandt noted in a December 5 X post that the metal’s price action displays a potential diamond pattern —a rare formation that typically signals indecision and possible trend reversals. Currently, gold is trading near $2,653, with the diamond structure forming between resistance at $2,748.2 and support at $2,629.6. Gold price analysis chart. Source: Peter Brandt A breakout above or below these levels could dictate the next major move, but the prevalence of similar patterns across assets has made traders hesitant to trust this signal fully. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to exhibit bullish sentiment despite experiencing a sharp drop below the $100,000 level. Bitcoin was trading at $98,070 at press time, having corrected by over 4% in the last 24 hours. As it stands, Bitcoin has the potential to reclaim the $100,000 resistance level, supported by its hold above $95,000. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

37287142,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623696,1733484832,The crypto bull run will not last as long as you think,"Crypto traders are fueling an explosive rally across financial markets, with Bitcoin surpassing $103,800 for the first time ever in a historic performance. But let’s not get carried away. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen an explosive bull run, and history shows it can come crashing down quickly, too. US President Trump’s vow to establish the country as the global crypto hub and his selection of pro-crypto regulators are key drivers of this surge. Retail traders fuel the frenzy Retail investors, often the first to arrive at market peaks, are back. A MarketVector index tracking the bottom half of the largest 100 cryptos has more than doubled since Trump’s November 5 election win, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 46% gain in the same period. But even with these jaw-dropping numbers, the index is still only a third of its pandemic-era peak. This is a critical phase in the bull cycle: the latter half, where big returns are possible but risks are magnified. Breadth and leverage are elevated but not overextended. NFTs are also seeing a resurgence. The Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Index jumped 106% in November, its best month since the start of 2022. Even so, the index is far below its record high, proving the fragility of this rebound. South Korea, a hotbed for crypto activity, saw trading volumes on local platforms hit $254 billion in November. For context, this figure surpasses the turnover on the Kospi, the country’s benchmark equity index. It’s bullish all over Trump’s choice for the SEC chair (a known crypto supporter) and the appointment of the first White House crypto czar have made markets bullish all over. Meanwhile, meme stocks like GameStop and AMC are seeing sharp intraday rallies. As we reported , a cryptic social media post from Keith Gill, the infamous “Roaring Kitty” of the 2021 investing craze, added to the frenzy. Bitcoin’s record-breaking week coincided with the Dow Jones Industrial Average nearing 45,000. Investors are pouring into everything from junk bonds to stocks, initially driven by easy monetary conditions. MicroStrategy has become the poster child for this speculative mania. The company’s stock has soared 464% this year, driven by its massive Bitcoin holdings worth around $41 billion. MicroStrategy plans to buy another $40 billion in Bitcoin, funding these purchases through convertible notes that investors can exchange for equity if the stock price rises. This strategy is as risky as it is ambitious. If Bitcoin prices drop, the impact on MicroStrategy’s stock could be catastrophic. The parallels to the meme stock rally of 2021 are unmistakable—everything works until it doesn’t. Signs of froth are everywhere. Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett pointed out that the S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio is now at 5.3, just shy of the 5.5 peak during the 2000 tech bubble. He warns of an “overshoot” in early 2025 if the S&P 500 climbs another 10% to 6,666 points. Bitcoin’s market cap now exceeds $2 trillion, making it comparable to the world’s 11th-largest economy. But while investors may be partying like it’s 2021, history suggests the music will eventually stop.

In a remarkable show of volatility, Bitcoin pumped from $98,100 to $104,100, dumped to $91,950 and pumped again above $98,000 – all in 24 hours. From the new all-time high (ATH) to the pump-and-dump local bottom, BTC moved approximately $240 billion in market cap. As of this writing, the leading cryptocurrency trades at $98,296, returning to its consolidation range before the action. Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar, one-hour (1H) price chart. Source: TradingView / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Nearly $500 million in BTC liquidations within a 24-hour pump and dump Notably, Bitcoin’s 24-hour pump and dump around the $100k mark has liquidated $486.92 million worth of trading positions. The bulls (long-position traders) were the most affected during the action, losing $416.79 million of BTC in 24 hours. According to data from CoinGlass , the largest single liquidation order was a $18.94 million BTC-USDT-SWAP order on OKX. Moreover, Bitcoin dominated the crypto liquidations by 54.5%, and altcoins held strong during BTC’s 24-hour pump and dump. Nevertheless, a total of 165,955 traders were affected in the leveraged market, losing over $892 million to liquidations. Liquidation Heatmap & Total Liquidations. Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin price prediction moving forward the volatility As things develop, Finbold has reported different price predictions for Bitcoin, which align for an overall bullish outlook. So, despite the recent pump and dump that suggested weakness above $100,000, analysts are optimistic about what is next. First, an exclusive Finbold report analyzed Bitcoin’s monthly historical price action in December since 2013, forecasting a positive outlook. According to this prediction, BTC will trade between $94,782 and $101,273 by the end of 2024. Looking further, TradingShot identified a chart pattern that could put Bitcoin at $140,000 by February 2025 . Meanwhile, the financial giant Standard Chartered sees BTC trading at $200,000 by the end of 2025 after correctly calling the $100k this year. However, Bitcoin’s volatility can still cause investors to see more “pump and dump” events, such as yesterday’s. On that note, the best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki believes that these BTC crashes offer opportunities for accumulation. Yet, investors and traders should be cautious and avoid losing money to market liquidations, having a solid plan on Bitcoin. Featured image from Shutterstock.

The election of Trump is expected to significantly reduce crypto regulation, making now a good time to consider investing in DAPP. DAPP is still down from its inception in April 2021, but it has significantly outperformed the S&P Cryptocurrency DeFi Index over the past 3-year and 1-year time frames. DAPP is a high-risk, high-reward investment suitable for a speculative growth category within a well-diversified portfolio, rated as a buy. The VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ) is a diversified yet relatively bold bet on the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The DAPP portfolio gives investors strong exposures to Bitcoin, digital asset exchanges, crypto miners, and other blockchain-based infrastructure companies. DAPP is +142% over the past year - no doubt supercharged by the thesis that Trump 2.0 will be much more friendly than the Biden administration toward all things crypto. That said, note that DAPP is still down significantly from its inception in April 2021 (see chart below). I would argue that, given the prospects for significant reductions in crypto regulation and the Trump 2.0 momentum factor, now is a good time to consider an allocation in the DAPP ETF. Today, I'll take a closer look at the DAPP and you can decide if it might be a good fit within your well-diversified portfolio. Data by YCharts Investment Thesis The election of Trump in November will likely lead to a step-function change in the regulatory outlook for Bitcoin and for cryptocurrencies in general. Indeed, Trump has said he wants the U.S. to become the ""Bitcoin superpower of the world"" and supports the establishment of a ""National Bitcoin Reserve"". Indeed, Trump recently announced crypto advocate Paul Atkins as his nominee for Chairman of the SEC. While there are other factors driving the recent price appreciation of BTC (see the Barron's article Why Did Bitcoin Surge Past $100,000 ), the response in the price of Bitcoin since the election is undeniable and has been both fast and furious: coinmarketcap.com As you can see from the graphic above, CoinMarketCap.com reports the current circulating supply of BTC is estimated to be 19.79 million and the total BTC market cap now exceeds US$2 trillion. As you know, the total possible BTC supply (i.e., the theoretical maximum mined limit) is capped at 21 million, which is estimated to be mined by the year 2140 . The point here is that there are only ~1.2 million BTC left to be mined (~5.7% of the total). With that as background, let's take a look to see how VanEck has positioned the DAPP ETF for investor success going forward. I'll start with a review of the top holdings. Top-10 Holdings The top-10 holdings are shown below and were taken directly from the VanEck DAPP ETF webpage where you can find more detailed information on the fund: Van Eck The #1 holding with an 11.7% weight is MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). MicroStrategy is arguably no longer a software company at all, but is, instead, a whale holder of a large reserve of Bitcoin. Indeed, Seeking Alpha reports that MSTR bought a whopping $1.5 billion worth of BTC from November 25 to December 1. The purchases were made using the proceeds of a recent $21 billion stock offering. As of December 1, MicroStrategy held an aggregate of ~402,100 Bitcoins, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of around $23.4 billion. Given the current BTC price (at pixel time) of $101,400, those BTCs are now worth $40.8 billion. MicroStrategy stock has soared on the ""Trump trade"" and is up 600%+ over the past year: Data by YCharts Coinbase Global ( COIN ) is the #2 holding with an 8.9% weight. COIN provides financial and technology infrastructure for consumers who want a marketplace to trade cryptocurrencies and/or securely accept crypto assets as payment. COIN announced its Q3 report on October 31st. Highlights included: Revenue of $1.2 billion (-17% qoq but +81% yoy) Net income of $75 million The 7th consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA ($449 million in Q3) A $1 billion share buyback plan COIN stock is +133% over the past year and trades with a forward P/E=62x (on adjusted earnings). Block ( SQ ), the old ""Square"", is the #3 holding with a 6.6% weight. Block operates the popular ""Cash App"", along with supporting commerce and financial products, hardware, and software services. Block has established a strong long-term track record of revenue growth: Seeking Alpha Block stock is +50% over the past year and trades with a TTM P/E=58.4x and a forward P/E=28.0x . The #7 holding with a 5.4% weight is Applied Digital Corp. ( APLD ). Applied provides and operates digital infrastructure solutions for the high-performance computing (""HPC"") and AI industries. APLD operates via three segments: Data Center Hosting Business, Cloud Services Business, and HPC Hosting Business. The company is expected to more than double revenue by 2026 (to $394 million). The Dallas-based company is +90% over the past year, but is still losing money (see Q4 FY24 results ), issuing shares (see here and here ), and taking on debt . Bitcoin miners are well represented in DAPP's top-10 holdings with Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), in aggregate, equating to a little over 10% of the entire portfolio. New York-based Cipher develops and operates industrial-scale Bitcoin mining in the U.S. Riot Platforms is also engaged in Bitcoin mining in the U.S. and operates through 3 segments: Bitcoin Mining, Data Center Hosting, and Engineering. The stocks of these two companies have been on divergent paths this year as RIOT has faced significant financial and operational challenges : Data by YCharts Performance As mentioned earlier, and despite the excellent performance over the past 12 months, the DAPP ETF is still down significantly from its price at inception in April 2021. The fund's 3-year average annual returns (-11%) reflect that fact: Van Eck That said, DAPP's 3-year and 1-year performance numbers significantly beat the S&P Cryptocurrency De-Fi Index (-29.3% and +38.4%, respectively). The following graphic compares the 1-year returns of the DAPP ETF as compared to two leading Bitcoin ETFs: The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ) and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ): Data by YCharts Interestingly enough, the DAPP ETF has been almost directly correlated to the Bitcoin ETFs over the past 6-months, with the 12-month returns being almost identical. ETF Basics: The following bullets summarize some of the ETF metrics that investors typically care about: Expense Ratio: 0.51% Total Net Assets: $211 million # of Holdings: 22 30-day SEC yield: 0% TTM P/E Ratio: 20.4x Price-to-Book Ratio: 3.34x As you can see, the DAPP ETF is certainly more expensive as compared to a low-cost S&P500 fund (VOO's expense fee is 0.03%). However, VanEck has a history of relatively expensive ETFs that deliver strong returns for investors (the SMH Semiconductor ETF, for example, is a favorite of mine). The DAPP ETF is still a ""young fund"" and $211 million of AUM is relatively tiny in the ETF universe. Likewise, the total number of holdings (22) is quite small. The (VanEck reported...) P/E and price-to-book ratios look almost too good to be true and are actually below that of the S&P500. Not sure how that works, considering many of the top holdings in the DAPP ETF are not yet GAAP earnings positive. Risks The risks of investing in DAPP are, to put it mildly, huge. I already mentioned the relatively low AUM and total number of holdings - both of which could lead to liquidity issues on a crypto-rout. Volatility is very high: back in Q2 of 2022, the DAPP ETF dropped a whopping 71%. Many of the companies in the DAPP portfolio are not yet GAAP earnings positive, and may never be. The DAPP ETF's portfolio of companies may have elevated risks as compared to ETFs that invest directly in Bitcoin (like the FBTC and IBIT ETFs mentioned earlier) because these companies have balance sheets, employee payrolls, and operational expenses whereas pure Bitcoin, obviously, does not. Given the massive recent gains in Bitcoin and the crypto-related companies, you may have already ""missed the boat"" on the Trump 2.0 momentum thesis. Upside risks include investors not having any direct exposure to Bitcoin and/or blockchain-based companies, and totally missing out on a continued bull market in the space. Summary & Conclusion Followers who have read my articles on portfolio management know that many investors can afford to have a ""speculative growth"" category within their otherwise well-diversified portfolio. Indeed, I have written previous articles on why Bitcoin is an excellent choice for this category (i.e., high-risk, high reward). See my November 2020 Seeking Alpha article Bitcoin Penetrates Further Into The 'Mainstream' - It Should Penetrate Your Portfolio Too , for example. For investors who want to make an arguably more leveraged bet on Bitcoin/crypto as compared to the straight-up Bitcoin ETFs, I advise you to consider the DAPP ETF, which I rate as a buy to profit from market momentum driven by the Trump 2.0 thesis.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742577-dapp-vaneck-excellent-etf-for-bitcoin-crypto-exchanges-and-blockchain-exposure?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37286910.jpeg

On December 5, nine spot Ether ETFs collectively received an inflow of $431.5 million, according to data from Farside Investors and Tree News. This influx surpassed the previous record of $333 million set just a week earlier on November 29. Ether ETFs Hit Unprecedented Growth The inflows are part of a nine-day streak of positive momentum, with over $1.3 billion accumulated in the past two weeks. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust led the charge, drawing a staggering $295.7 million in a single day. The fund’s total inflow now sits at $2.3 billion, cementing its dominance in the market. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund followed with $113.6 million, while smaller contributions came from Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust ($30.7 million) and the Bitwise Ethereum ETF ($6.6 million). Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, once a leader, faced an outflow of $15.1 million as the fund continues to lose market share to newer competitors. Bitcoin ETFs Maintain Momentum Spot Bitcoin ETFs also showed robust activity, recording a combined net inflow of $747.8 million on the same day. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust accounted for a remarkable $751.6 million of this figure, counteracting outflows of $148.8 million from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust. Over the past five trading days, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has accumulated nearly $2.5 billion, pushing its total inflow since launch to an eye-popping $34 billion.

37286847,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98456,1733484278,Why Crypto Billionaire Mike Novogratz Thinks Satoshi Nakamoto Is No Longer Alive,"Bitcoin (BTC) currently underpins a $3.7 trillion crypto industry, is now traded on Wall Street , and is even legal tender in one country. But despite its stratospheric rise, a deep mystery remains at its heart: is its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto still alive? Is Satoshi Dead Or Alive? Here’s Mike Novogratz’s Take Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has shared his take on whether the Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto is still alive. Speaking to CNBC , Novogratz suggested that the elusive BTC inventor is long dead. “If Satoshi was alive (cause I don’t think he is), I’m sure that he’d have a big smile on his face,” he opined while commenting on Bitcoin’s ballistic rally to a newfound record perch around $103,600 . Novogratz described Bitcoin as the “greatest example” of a huge team of people coming together to do something “really spectacular.” While Satoshi initially created Bitcoin as a means of payment, the flagship crypto eventually evolved into “digital gold”, Novogratz observed. Speculation about whether or not Satoshi is still alive has been running wild. Several names have been put forward as the possible identity of Satoshi. Some even believe Satoshi may have been a group of people rather than one individual, further muddying the waters. Early Bitcoin adopter Hal Finney, who was previously tipped as a possible Satoshi candidate, passed away in 2014. A recent HBO documentary named Peter Todd as being Satoshi. However, Todd and the crypto community at large vehemently dismissed this assertion. That being said, most in the cryptosphere actually love the fact that the mystery remains unsolved. Painful Bitcoin Pullback Inevitable Novogratz further observed that recent weeks have been characterized by a Bitcoin buying frenzy by investors across the globe. Nevertheless, he cautioned that there is massive leverage in the market. As such, the crypto tycoon is sure that Bitcoin will suffer one or two brutal price retracements that will test investors’ souls. “When there is that much leverage in the system, it washes it out,” Novogratz explained. On Thursday, the world’s largest crypto by market cap plummeted 6% to as low as $92,000 within three minutes before swiftly recovering. As of press time, BTC was changing hands for $98,227, representing a 4.1% drop on the day.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/why-crypto-billionaire-mike-novogratz-thinks-satoshi-nakamoto-is-no-longer-alive/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37286567,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107743,1733484123,Crypto Adoption Thrives in India Despite Harsh Tax Regulations,"India’s cryptocurrency market continues to show resilience, even in the face of stringent tax policies. Raj Karkara , COO of ZebPay , highlighted this optimism in a recent interview with Cointelegraph , emphasizing the country’s growing number of crypto holders and its potential to lead globally in digital finance. India imposes a 30% capital gains tax on crypto trading profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions—policies that have deterred frequent trading and diminished returns. Yet, the Indian crypto ecosystem remains vibrant, with over 100 million crypto holders , according to Chainalysis data . India’s Harsh Tax Environment 1. The Current Tax Structure 30% Capital Gains Tax: Levied on profits from cryptocurrency trades. 1% TDS: Applied to all cryptocurrency transactions, regardless of profitability. These taxes have drawn criticism from investors and traders, who argue that the policies: Deter Active Trading: Frequent traders face significant losses due to the high TDS rate. Reduce Profit Margins: The steep capital gains tax cuts into overall returns. 2. Impact on Market Activity Trading volumes have experienced a dip on Indian exchanges as some traders shift to offshore platforms or peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions to mitigate tax burdens. Crypto Adoption Thrives Despite Challenges 1. 100 Million Crypto Holders India boasts a vibrant crypto community with over 100 million crypto holders , positioning it among the global leaders in cryptocurrency adoption. 2. Demographic Advantage Karkara attributes this growth to: Young Population: A large segment of India’s population is tech-savvy and open to experimenting with new technologies. Digital Transformation: India’s rapid shift toward a digital economy provides fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. Why Crypto Continues to Grow in India 1. Cultural and Economic Factors Tech-Savvy Youth: India’s youth are more inclined to explore digital assets and blockchain technology. Rising Internet Penetration: Increasing access to affordable smartphones and internet services has fueled crypto education and engagement. 2. Strategic Importance of Crypto Despite regulatory challenges, cryptocurrency offers Indians an alternative avenue for: Wealth creation. Cross-border transactions. Access to global markets. ZebPay COO’s Optimism Raj Karkara remains bullish on India’s crypto future: “India has a young and tech-savvy population. This positions the country as a dynamic player in the global cryptocurrency landscape.” 1. Collaboration with Regulators Karkara urges the Indian government to consider: Revising Tax Policies: To promote fair trading conditions. Building a Comprehensive Regulatory Framework: That balances innovation with investor protection. 2. Industry Resilience Indian exchanges like ZebPay continue to: Educate users on crypto adoption. Advocate for clearer regulatory measures to ensure sustainable growth. Conclusion Despite a harsh tax environment , India’s crypto market demonstrates remarkable resilience, driven by its young, tech-savvy population and a growing appetite for digital assets. While the 30% capital gains tax and 1% TDS remain obstacles, the country’s burgeoning crypto adoption showcases its potential to emerge as a global leader in digital finance. As India navigates its regulatory challenges, collaboration between the government and the crypto industry will be key to unlocking its full potential.

These gains come as the cryptocurrency sector seems to be pivoting towards altcoin season , as evidenced by the Altcoin Season Idex, which recently hit an all-time high of 87. An index score above 80 typically signals the onset of altcoin season. However, investors need to be cautious as these gains are often short-lived. In May, the GME token rose from $0.0035 to $0.029 after Roaring Kitty’s return, only to erase all those gains within a few days. It dropped to a record low of $0.0017 in August. Similarly, in September, these tokens rallied following Gill’s X post but lost almost all of the gains in a little over a week as the excitement waned. Beyond the crypto space, Gill’s return pushed GameStop (GME) shares over 16% on the day, reaching a high of $30.87 before settling at $28.60, while AMC Entertainment (AMC) recorded a 12% jump to $5.55, according to Google Finance data.

(NYSE: SQ ) as its “ new best idea ” for 2025, raising the stock’s price target from $90 to $120 while maintaining an “Outperform” rating. This bullish forecast stems from multiple catalysts, including accelerated growth in Square’s Gross Payment Volume (GPV), robust 30% EBITDA gains from operational efficiencies, easing regulatory pressures, and the potential for inclusion in the S&P 500 Index. Block five-day stock price. Source: Finbold Currently trading at $95.87, Block has experienced a remarkable 24% gain over the past month, with its year-to-date performance up by 32%. Its valuation remains appealing, with 16% of its market capitalization held in cash, providing ample flexibility for growth initiatives. Following Bernstein’s announcement, the stock climbed 1.7% in premarket trading on Monday. Bernstein also projects that Block could generate $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion in cash flow by the end of 2025. Strong black friday-cyber Monday performance supports growth outlook Block’s recent success during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend underscores its growth potential. Sellers leveraging Block’s ecosystem of commerce tools facilitated a record-breaking 144 million transactions globally, marking a 17% increase year-over-year. Online and in-store sales surged by 21% and 17%, respectively, driven by high demand for mega-discount deals during the shopping weekend. The integration of Afterpay with Google Pay ahead of the holiday season is another key growth driver. This move allows customers to split purchases into installments directly through Google Pay, expanding Afterpay’s reach and bolstering Block’s revenues. “Afterpay’s integration with Google Pay comes at the perfect time as next-gen shoppers are fueling mainstream use of BNPL, mobile commerce, and digital wallet use,” said Tanuj Parikh, Head of Global Partnerships, Afterpay, and Cash App. The rollout of Afterpay on Cash App Cards is expected to transform the cards into a viable alternative to traditional credit cards, further enhancing user adoption and financial performance. Financial highlights and growth outlook Block’s Q3 2024 earnings showcased its operational strength, with total net revenue climbing 6.4% year-over-year to 5.98 billion. Excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ) revenue, the topline grew by 11%, fueled by a 20% increase in subscription and services revenue. Adjusted EPS surged 76% to $0.88, driven by improved cost management and a 370-basis-point expansion in net profit margins. The company’s robust balance sheet, which includes $2.7 billion in net cash and a $775 million revolving credit facility, positions Block to pursue strategic acquisitions. Despite its strengths, Block trades at a forward P/E ratio of just 22.89 and boasts a PEG ratio of 0.58, highlighting its growth potential at a reasonable valuation, according to StockAnalysis. Analyst upgrades reflect confidence Amid this backdrop, analysts remain bullish on Block. BTIG for instance raised its price target for Block to $110 from $90, maintaining a Buy rating and reaffirming it as the top large-cap payments pick for 2025 due to its unique growth drivers beyond customer acquisition and transaction volume. Goldman Sachs also raised its price target for Block to $102 from $87, maintaining a Buy rating. The firm highlights fintech’s growth potential amid a stronger economy, inflation, and favorable policy changes, with payment technology stocks gaining 18% on average since the election. However, Goldman advises caution due to valuation and limited visibility to an acceleration in fundamentals, favoring a selective approach to investments. That being said, Block’s ability to sustain growth through strategic initiatives and operational efficiency makes it a compelling pick for 2025. Despite some analysts noting near-term downside risks, Block’s long-term potential remains intact, supported by strong fundamentals and innovative product rollouts.

37286324,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623687,1733483599,Is Satoshi Nakamoto dead? Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz weighs in,"During a recent interview discussing Bitcoin’s ascent to the 100k milestone, Mike Novogratz remarked that he suspects Satoshi Nakamoto is no longer alive. He said that Satoshi Nakamoto would take pride in Bitcoin’s significant achievements. Novogratz said , “If Satoshi was alive (cause I don’t think he is), I’m sure that he’d have a big smile on his face.” Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, is still one of the biggest mysteries in the tech world. At different points, there have been rumors linking various people with the pseudonymous identity of the blockchain innovator, especially well-known characters with interesting pasts. At the same time, investors and market analysts have different ideas about whether Satoshi is still alive. Hal Finney, one of the top Satoshi candidates, died in 2014. A recent HBO documentary said that the crypto’s author is a 39-year-old Canadian programmer named Peter Todd. Todd, however, rejected the claim, and the rest of the crypto world didn’t believe either. Mike Novogratz discusses Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin The Galaxy Digital CEO said that despite Satoshi’s initial perception of Bitcoin as a payment method, the original crypto ultimately evolved into “digital gold,” He further stated that Bitcoin is “the greatest example” of a large coalition of individuals uniting to accomplish something “truly spectacular.” He clarified that the price of Bitcoin can only fall if the community decides to do so. However, as long as individuals choose to use it, it will not be affected. In the interview, he said that Bitcoin would not be where it is now if people knew who Satoshi was. He said that the social construction, not the technology, is what gives something worth. “You say it is valuable. I say it is valuable. Therefore, it is valuable.” He went on to say that people would be less likely to buy Bitcoin as a way to store their value if they knew who created it. He said, “There is something about the mystery of not knowing who Satoshi is.” Investigations into the Satoshi Nakamoto mystery Bitcoin was first mined on Jan. 3, 2009, by “Satoshi Nakamoto,” a pseudonym for the person or group responsible for its creation. Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a whitepaper called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” and sent it to a cryptography email list months before the first Bitcoin was mined. The article, which came out on October 31, 2008, described a safe, decentralized peer-to-peer mechanism. Dorian Nakamoto was also mistakenly identified as Satoshi. Nevertheless, he consistently denied any involvement. Then there is Len Sassaman, a renowned cypherpunk and cryptographer who has embraced privacy and whose technical abilities and ideals are in close alignment with Bitcoin’s ethics. Nick Szabo, Hal Finney, and Adam Back are additional names that are currently under speculation. Craig Wright, who has long asserted that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, was also involved in the Satoshi Nakamoto hunt. Recently, a UK court ruled that Craig is not Satoshi and ordered an end to all his delusions. Nakamoto remains a mysterious figure. Fomo warning to traders in Satoshi’s market Traders who are tempted to impulsively invest in Bitcoin (BTC) at record prices due to the “fear of missing out” (FOMO) should be aware that the market is currently exhibiting a significant degree of confusion, which is a departure from the recent strong bull momentum. The confusion is evident in BTC’s trading on Thursday, as it eventually rose to six figures, reaching record highs near $103,900 before dropping to $91,100. Ultimately, the day ended at approximately $97,000 in UTC. According to on-chain data, the trading range was so extensive that it encompassed all price action since November 20. BTC price movement. Source: CoinDesk The high wave candle, along with the bearish divergence observed in the relative strength index, a key momentum indicator, suggests a phase of consolidation or a potential short-term bearish shift in the market trend. A bearish divergence occurs when the momentum oscillator, like the RSI, fails to validate the new price peak. This cautionary signal is even more noteworthy because the pattern appears at record highs, indicating a failure to maintain advances over the widely watched $100K threshold. It indicates that the bulls now have less than complete control, with sellers attempting to re-establish themselves. Investors looking to chase the market at this time should consider these indications.

Under Michael Saylor’s leadership, MicroStrategy has bought 402,100 BTC , now worth over $39 billion. Semler Scientific is currently the 14th largest Bitcoin holder among publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Other firms have also followed suit, including Japanese investment firm Metaplanet. Bitcoin mining giant MARA Holdings , previously known as Marathon Digital, also announced on Dec. 2 that it was offering $850 million in convertible senior notes to purchase additional Bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/semler-scientific-doubles-down-on-microstrategy-playbook-with-another-29-million-bitcoin-buy/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

At this point, it was claimed that Florida could also invest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset in the first quarter of 2025. Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA) President Samuel Armes said in a post that Florida has a “very good chance of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve” during the legislative session that begins in the first quarter of 2025. Samuel Armes noted that the basis for this move is based on Florida’s existing investments in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related assets. Florida has previously invested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related assets through its pension fund. “Florida has a very good chance of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve this session, which will begin in the first quarter of 2025. Here are some of the ways we can implement the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in Florida: 1) Use our $185.7 billion retirement fund (4th largest in the US) to allocate a small percentage to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. But just to note, Florida already has investments in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related assets through our retirement fund. 2) Use our budget surplus ($116.5 billion in FY2024-25) to invest in BTC without cutting essential services. My organization will be pushing this bill hard, along with approximately three other pro-Bitcoin bills, this legislative session.” *This is not investment advice.

Elon Musk's continued support adds to its appeal despite its speculative nature. Technical analysis suggests DOGE could surpass $1, driven by market sentiment and Fibonacci extensions, though short-term corrections are possible. Despite high volatility and lack of fundamentals, I rate DOGE a buy due to the overall growth potential in Altcoins. Thesis Summary Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) has appreciated 160% in the last month, and it seems like the rally could keep going over the next few months as Altseason takes hold. The appeal to investing in DOGE continues to be based purely on speculation and narrative, but that doesn't mean we can't make rational and measured trading decisions. With a crypto-friendly president taking over in 2025, Elon Musk, ""the Dogefather"" positioned to exert some influence in the new administration, and overall crypto enthusiasm beginning to take hold, I think it's still a good time to buy DOGE. Based on previous highs, DOGE could break above $1 in the coming year, though holders should have a clear plan in place to take profits or reduce potential losses. Is DOGE Coin Still Relevant? The short answer is yes. Although it has been a few years since the DOGE price topped and it became a household name, the cryptocurrency holds a special place in the crypto market, and it has the right ingredients to stage a strong rally. For starters, Elon Musk continues to be a DOGE evangelist and it is no coincidence that he is now running the Department Of Government Efficiency. Musk's interest in DOGE has not waned, and he continues to engage with the community on Twitter. Elon Musk Tweet (X) It has even been speculated that DOGE could become part of X's new payment system , though there's no evidence to back this up. If we look at interest over time, we can see that interest in DOGE sparked again after the elections. DOGE Search Activity (Google Trends) With that said, we have yet to reach the levels seen in 2021. DOGE; On-Chain Metrics The recent price surge in DOGE can also be backed by increased whale activity. DOGE Whale Activity (Santiment) Large holders of DOGE have been active in the last few months, and this is the kind of activity we saw ahead of the big rally in 2021. On top of that, as was pointed out by Musk in the Tweet above, DOGE is programmed to become less inflationary over time, which means it's actually designed to hold its value somewhat. DOGE Inflation (X) In reality, it's unlikely that DOGE will become anything more than a meme, but that doesn't mean we can't benefit from the coming rally. Chart and Technical Analysis There are a couple of important charts we need to look at now. Firstly, the TOTAL3 chart, which measures the market cap of the crypto market excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum. TOTAL3 (TradingView) In other words, this measures the relative performance of Altcoins. As we can see, this chart finally broke above its 2021 high of $1.2T, showing a shift in sentiment as we enter 2025. Furthermore, according to data from Into The Block , BTC and DOGE have a correlation coefficient of 0.98, which means where BTC goes, DOGE will go. Now, with that said, let's see how high DOGE could go. DOGE TA (TrendSpider) By measuring the decline from the 2021 highs, we can look at the Fibonacci extensions. The most relevant of which is the golden ratio, 61.8%. The 1.618 ext of the decline projects us towards $1.17 in the DOGE price. I believe this area will act like a magnet, although we could reverse it a little bit sooner. However, the $1 level is an important psychological threshold, and it makes sense that we would surpass previous highs in DOGE as the overall market cap for crypto increases. DOGE TA 4h Chart (TrendSpider) If we zoom into the 4h chart, however, it is true that we are looking toppy. We have built a large bearish divergence in the RSI and the MACD has flipped negative. I think we could see DOGE re-test some key levels, such as the 50-day EMA, or even as low as the 200 EMA. I'd consider adding a bit at the $0.32 level, where we also have some important fib confluence. Risks Although there's an upside to DOGE, in my opinion, this is a highly volatile asset, that is really not backed by much in terms of fundamentals. Even with Musk's support, there's no real development team behind the coin or any real-world applications. Takeaway All in all, I rate DOGE a buy because I believe Altcoins in general still have room to grow. This is probably not the best Altcoin out there, but it can still deliver substantial returns as the crypto hype continues.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742575-dogecoin-doge-unleash-elon-musk-beast?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37286090.jpeg
37285930,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373663,1733482987,Donald Trump Appoints David Sacks as Cryptocurrency and AI ‘Czar’,"President-elect Donald Trump has appointed David O. Sacks, formerly PayPal’s COO, as his “czar” for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. This decision marks a significant move in reshaping US policy. Trump stated that Sacks would play a key role in preserving free expression online and addressing issues of Big Tech’s influence and censorship. Sacks is also set to oversee the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Steering Away From Big Tech Bias And Censorship In a December 6th post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship. He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US.” Under Trump’s leadership, the crypto czar, alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairs, is expected to lead efforts to overhaul digital currency policies, supported by a newly established advisory council. Advocates within Trump’s tech base favor minimal government intervention in AI and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, asserting that excessive regulations risk stifling innovation in these emerging sectors. Sacks played a key role at PayPal in its early days and co-founded Yammer, later acquired by Microsoft for $1.2 billion in 2012. He has since become known for co-hosting the popular All In podcast. Who is David O. Sacks? The 52-year-old South African-American entrepreneur was among the first to champion cryptocurrencies, stating in a 2017 CNBC interview that Bitcoin was reshaping the internet as the world’s largest one. “After PayPal, I never thought I would get interested in payments again. But Bitcoin is fulfilling PayPal’s original vision to create “the new world currency.” But cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are now fulfilling that original vision. They are doing it in a decentralized way (with a decentralized database called the blockchain) whereas PayPal tried to do it in a centralized way.” He is also the co-founder of a venture capital firm called ‘Craft Ventures,’ which has invested in a range of crypto ventures, including dYdX, Lightning Labs, River Financial, Kresus, Set Protocol, FOLD, Harbor, Handshake, Voltage, Galoy, Lumina, and Rare Bit. Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks suggests he is recognizing high-profile entrepreneurs who played a role in backing his presidential bid. This year, Sacks emerged as a major Trump advocate, organizing a fundraiser that brought in $12 million for the Republican campaign. Besides Sacks, Trump had previously appointed Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). The duo was tasked with eliminating bureaucratic inefficiencies, reducing government spending, and streamlining regulations. Calling D.O.G.E as the “Manhattan Project” of the current era, Trump highlighted that the initiative aligns with his “Save America” agenda to transform the federal government.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO.

""We think the Fed currently is minded to cut."" ""Focus will also be on the unemployment rate, where a rise back to 4.2% slightly favors a Fed cut, while no change at 4.1% would support the dollar on the view that the central bank may well skip a cut in December after all.""

Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Has Remained Negative During Latest Rally As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, Bitcoin has continued to leave exchanges recently. The on-chain metric of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the net amount of BTC that’s entering into or exiting out of the wallets attached to centralized platforms. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Trader Profits Back In ‘Healthy’ Range, Is BTC Ready For $100,000? When the value of this metric is positive, it means the investors are making net deposits to the exchanges. As one of the main reasons why holders use these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish implication for BTC. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies there are a higher amount of exchange outflows happening than inflows. Such a trend can be a sign that the investors want to hold onto their coins into the long-term, which is something that can naturally be bullish for the asset’s price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow has observed significant negative spikes during the last month or so, suggesting some large withdrawals have occurred. This net outflow spree has come even though the cryptocurrency has observed a massive run to new ATHs. The chart shows that this wasn’t the case during the rally in the first quarter of this year. Outflows were happening back then for sure, but there were also notable net inflow spikes between them, implying that demand was present for selling the asset. The recent negative Exchange Netflow has maintained for Bitcoin through the latest rally beyond $100,000, a sign that investors are still unwilling to part with their BTC even at these high prices. Related Reading: Ethereum To $10,000: Analyst Reveals Mid & Long-Term ETH Targets If this trend continues, it’s possible that this run could still have more room to run. However, it remains to be seen how long holders can stay quiet. Generally, the higher the investor profits, the more likely they become to participate in a mass selloff. So, with Bitcoin continuing to perform well, it may only be a matter of time before a large profit-taking spree arrives.

The Tesla CEO argues this is the only way to truly strengthen the economy by focusing on tangible output. His remarks came after his appearance on Capitol Hill, where he and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy discussed plans to slash federal spending and overhaul the bureaucracy. The two were appointed by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), an advisory body tasked with providing recommendations to streamline government functions and cut unnecessary spending. Their visit to Washington was the beginning of a series of in-person meetings with lawmakers, setting the stage for a sweeping review of federal operations. Elon’s plans with D.O.G.E Elon and Vivek, as outside advisers, are not official government employees. Their role involves gathering data, brainstorming solutions, and delivering actionable recommendations to the Trump administration by July 4, 2026. The goal is ambitious: dismantle wasteful government spending while maintaining critical services like Social Security and Medicare, two programs Trump has vowed to protect. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the discussions with Elon and Vivek a “brainstorming session.” He said they were essential for “laying the groundwork” for upcoming legislative priorities. Lawmakers, including Senator Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said the focus should include regulatory relief. “There are tens of billions of dollars in regulatory relief on the table now,” Tillis said, pointing to areas where excessive rules could be rolled back. D.O.G.E. is not an official government department despite its name. It operates as a nimble advisory unit under the executive office of the president. This setup allows Elon and Vivek to propose bold ideas without the constraints of traditional bureaucracy. They are assembling a small team of 10 to 12 staffers who will work with the Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, each federal department will have a D.O.G.E liaison to implement recommendations on spending and efficiency. Cutting costs, trimming regulations, and targeting Rivian One of D.O.G.E.’s early targets may be a $6.6 billion federal loan to Rivian Automotive, a Tesla competitor. Elon’s criticism of government subsidies has been a focal point of his political rhetoric. He reiterated his opposition to tax credits for electric vehicles, saying, “I think we should get rid of all credits.” This aligns with Republican goals of cutting clean energy funding and prioritizing private-sector competition. The mission includes identifying regulations that D.O.G.E. believes exceed federal agencies’ legal authority. Elon and Vivek intend to compile a list of such rules and present it to Trump. The president can then pause enforcement through executive action while initiating a review process to rescind them. This approach could deliver immediate cost savings and regulatory relief without needing congressional approval. Elon’s political influence and controversies Elon’s expanding role in politics has drawn scrutiny. His super PAC, America PAC, spent over $152 million during the 2024 campaign to support Trump and other Republican candidates. He also used his platform, X (formerly Twitter), to amplify pro-Trump messages, turning the social media giant into a megaphone for conservative causes. Critics argue this dual role as a political influencer and government adviser could create conflicts of interest, particularly given SpaceX’s reliance on federal contracts. And also the fact that Elon does tend to get petty and vindictive sometimes. If his Trump power remains unchecked after the president takes the Oval, folks are worried he’ll want revenge on his long list of haters.

CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn says the warnings were there, but many traders overlooked them. This sudden drop led to large liquidations, worrying investors with long positions. Key Warning Signs Ignored Maartunn highlighted several key indicators pointing to a potential drop. According to Maartunn one of the main indicators was Binance’s Net Taker Volume, which showed strong buying activity. While this might look positive at first, it hinted that the price rise wasn’t stable and could slow down soon. Yesterday's -10% dip had some wondering: ""Did on-chain indicators see it coming?""

Maartunn explained that open interest went up by 15%, showing that the market was relying more on borrowed money. While this helped push prices higher, it also made the market more risky, especially as greed took over. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index was another warning sign, showing that the market was deep in greed. At the same time, retail demand jumped by 30% over the last 30 days, reaching its highest level in four years. Together, these metrics underscored a market poised for a correction. Long Liquidations Hit Record Highs As Maartunn explained, the result of these factors was inevitable a massive wave of liquidations occurred . Over $150 million worth of long positions were liquidated, marking the highest long liquidation event in at least 1.5 years.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Polkadot, Ethereum, and Rollblock lead the charge in a $2.7 trillion crypto market surge, offering investors scalability and real-world rewards. Table of Contents Rollblock: The rising crypto redefining rewards Polkadot: A rising star in interoperability Ethereum: A powerhouse in institutional momentum Why these projects are poised to thrive The unprecedented $2.7 trillion trading volume in the crypto exchange market underscores the soaring momentum of the ongoing bull run. Amid this surge, Polkadot, Ethereum, and Rollblock are emerging as key players, each carving out its space as a must-watch contender for investors looking to capitalize on market opportunities. Rollblock: The rising crypto redefining rewards While Polkadot and Ethereum ride the bull run, Rollblock distinguishes itself as a unique player in the crypto exchange ecosystem. Its GambleFi model combines decentralized finance (DeFi) with blockchain gaming, offering token holders weekly distributions of casino profits. The project’s deflationary tokenomics—burning 60% of repurchased tokens and redistributing 40% to stakers—ensures sustainable value growth. The ongoing presale , already raising over $6.7 million, offers tokens at an accessible $0.037, appealing to both seasoned investors and newcomers. Rollblock’s approach and real-world utility make it one of the leading cryptos to buy now, delivering immediate and consistent rewards that stand apart from speculative market trends. Polkadot: A rising star in interoperability Polkadot is proving its worth with DOT’s price touching $10. Its 154.50% surge over the last month highlights its increasing appeal among developers and investors alike. Currently supported by bullish sentiment in 88% of market indicators and a Fear & Greed index reading of 80 (“Extreme Greed”), Polkadot’s upward trajectory seems solid. Market predictions suggest a further 25.52% increase, with DOT potentially reaching $12.68 by December 8. The anticipated launch of Polkadot 2.0 in Q1 2025 aims to improve scalability and developer accessibility, with Elastic Scaling expected to reduce block times to six seconds. With robust staking yields and stablecoin adoption surpassing $120 million, Polkadot is positioned as a prominent force in this bullish phase.

Complementing this development, Ethereum has seen a 43% monthly price increase alongside a record-breaking open interest of $24.34 billion, signaling heightened market activity. With robust support above $3,600 and critical resistance near $3,700, Ethereum is well-positioned for continued upward momentum. The ongoing shift in liquidity from Bitcoin dominance toward altcoins places Ethereum as a pivotal beneficiary, reinforcing its integral role in the expanding crypto exchange market and the broader bull run. Why these projects are poised to thrive Amid the unprecedented $2.7 trillion trading volume, Polkadot, Ethereum, and Rollblock stand out as prime opportunities for investors. Polkadot’s focus on scalability complements its bullish market outlook. Ethereum’s dominance in institutional inflows and DeFi applications cements its status as a market leader, while Rollblock’s groundbreaking GambleFi ecosystem redefines rising crypto potential. Together, these projects exemplify the resilience shaping the current bull run. Meanwhile, Rollblock’s unique blend of blockchain gaming and GambleFi offers tangible value and groundbreaking utility. These projects not only highlight the diversity of the crypto exchange landscape but also present compelling opportunities for investors seeking to maximize returns. Whether through Polkadot’s interoperability, Ethereum’s institutional backing, or Rollblock’s transformative model, the current bull run provides a fertile ground for growth.

Huge volatility on Thursday left more than 158,000 liquidated to the tune of $873 million. What’s next for Bitcoin? Massive volatility liquidates traders Massive volatility on Thursday caught many traders unawares. From almost touching $104,000 early on Thursday, the price went sideways for the next 12 hours before a dip over the next few hours that went below $100,000. However, what was to come caused panic among traders, as within the space of a few minutes the price plunged spectacularly from $99,000, all the way down to $92,000, liquidating the vast majority of long positions as it did so . A precipitous nosedive Source: TradingView The hourly time frame for $BTC shows just how precipitous the nosedive in the price was on Thursday. Not many would have foreseen such a sharp descent in the price, and therefore breached liquidation levels all the way down to $92,000 would have wiped out most traders in long positions. Interestingly, the wick down stopped at the ascending trendline which stretches all the way back to the double top of the 2021 bull market. This trendline has now become a very important support level. Heavy buying from U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Thursday’s price shenanigans would not have been caused by the continued heavy purchases of BTC by the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs . The ETFs bought big again on Thursday with a total of 7.58K more BTC purchased. More than this was actually bought by the IBIT Blackrock ETF, which bought 7.62K BTC, but this was in the face of a big sale of 1.51K by Grayscale’s GBTC fund. Trump is pivotal for crypto fortunes While demand remains extremely positive, the regulatory environment for crypto in the United States just keeps on getting more benign. After Paul Atkins was nominated by president in waiting Donald Trump for the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), former PayPal COO David Sacks was then nominated for the post of Head of AI, and Crypto Czar. Incoming president Donald Trump has been pivotal in this about face in the fortunes of crypto in the United States.

37285812,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317648,1733482324,Former US Treasury Secretary Calls Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan ‘Crazy’,"Lawrence Summers, a former US Treasury Secretary, has criticized President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal for the US government to establish a Bitcoin reserve , labeling the idea as impractical. Speaking on Bloomberg Television’s “ Wall Street Week ,” Summers voiced concerns about the plan, which he believes serves primarily to appease campaign donors rather than to support the nation’s financial health. According to Trump’s proposal, the government would retain ownership of approximately 200,000 Bitcoins, currently held due to past asset seizures. Bitcoin Reserve Could Help Reduce National Debt Advocates suggest that this reserve could expand and potentially help in reducing the national debt through its appreciation over time. Additionally, Trump has appointed cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), signaling a pro-crypto administration. Summers, who also serves as a Harvard University professor and a Bloomberg TV contributor, said that there may be instances where the crypto industry has faced excessive regulation. He said that he supports the need for financial innovation but questions the rationale behind a national Bitcoin reserve. Summers commented: “Of all the prices to support, why would the government choose to support, by accumulating a sterile inventory, a bunch of Bitcoin?” Separately, Summers addressed another significant challenge facing the upcoming administration: the ambitious plan by Elon Musk, set to co-chair the Department of Government Efficiency advisory panel alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, to slash federal spending by $2 trillion. JUST IN – Trump, if President, pledges to form a Bitcoin Reserve, using 210,000 Bitcoin seized by the Department of Justice, as the core of a new “Strategic National Bitcoin Stockpile.” pic.twitter.com/ucvlyP3BDx — Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) July 27, 2024 Summers pointed out that such a figure surpasses the entire federal government payroll, and most government expenditures are dedicated to national defense and senior support—areas difficult to cut without severe political backlash. US Needs to Either Reduce Entitlements or Increase Taxes Summers argues that the US must either bravely reduce entitlements that Americans have long expected or opt to increase taxes, with Summers personally advocating for the latter. He also touched upon broader global fiscal challenges, citing recent governmental collapses in France, South Korea, and Germany over budget disputes. As the demographic of older people grows and healthcare costs surge, the burden of entitlements continues to rise, complicating budget management further. “We have entitled societies that haven’t come to peace with what’s necessary to meet the entitlement,” he said. Summers also noted the importance of leaders clearly communicating to the public about the need for fiscal adjustments, such as spending cuts or increased taxes. “I don’t think our leaders have been able to persuade people of that need. That’s what is fundamentally behind the conflict.” However, it is worth noting that selling Bitcoin might prove to be a very bad decision. As reported, Germany’s decision to sell off nearly 50,000 Bitcoin in July at $53,000 per coin has led to a substantial financial loss, as Bitcoin has recently surged to a new all-time high of $104,000 per coin. If the Bitcoin had been retained until now, the 49,858 BTC sold could have been valued at approximately $5.18 billion. Instead, the sale conducted between June 19 and July 12 generated about $2.64 billion for the German authorities, resulting in an estimated loss of around $2.54 billion.

37285566,https://crypto.news/?p=14316745,1733482318,What is a crypto rug pull? How to stay safe from rug pulls,"Many people work hard for their favorite airdrops in return for a healthy chunk of tokens. Some manage to find the perfect bottom entries on tokens that pump very hard, but guess what? All of this hard work goes away when a crypto rug pull happens! Table of Contents What is a rug pull in crypto? Where and how do rug pulls happen? Types of crypto rug pulls Examples of notable rug pulls Impact of rug pulls on crypto adoption How to spot a rug pull? Regulations and oversight In this article, we’ll discuss the type of rug pulls in crypto, how you can remain safe from them, and the overall impact of rug pulls in the crypto world. What is a rug pull in crypto? What happens when you’re standing on a rug and someone suddenly pulls it? You fall, right? That is exactly what a crypto rug pull is! Typically it happens when the people who created the cryptocurrency token a.k.a the developers, abandon the crypto project, running away with the investor funds. This results in the token price taking a nose dive and leaving investors with tokens of no value. Usually, there are signs before a rug pull in any crypto coin is about to happen but for that, it is important to learn where and how exactly rug pulls happen. Where and how do rug pulls happen? Typically, a classic rug pull usually happens on decentralized exchanges and NFT projects due to a lack of regulation and pseudonymity of crypto developers. This is because anyone can create a token, supply liquidity to it, and launch it on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Pancakeswap, and some degen platforms like pump.fun. Now what happens is that scammers hide behind fake identities as there is no KYC and launch a token on decentralized platforms. Next, they market it on social media platforms like X, Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, Discord, and others. Typically, scammers launch meme coins as new investors get easily trapped in them, all of this happens of course with the use of fake partnerships with influencers and promises of high returns. Unfortunately, in the end, the rags-to-riches dream of retail people becomes dust as the shady developers close the project abruptly and run away with the funds, leaving investors hopeless with no hope of recovery in the unregulated market space of cryptocurrencies. Types of crypto rug pulls The typical rug pull in crypto is what we described above, as it involves launching, marketing, and eventually shutting down the project, leaving investors with nothing. In the end, it all boils down to two categories, either a project can do a hard rug pull or a soft rug pull, let’s find out the key differences between them. Hard pull vs. Soft pull A hard pull requires lots of effort and some technical knowledge of how a smart contract works This is because a hard pull requires writing and entering malicious code in a project’s smart contract, which stops users from withdrawing their tokens. The StableMagnet rug pull is a classic example of a hard pull as the developers of the project hid a backdoor in their smart contract that allowed them to pull off this hack. On the other hand, a soft pull is simply a way for project developers to sell their token holdings in batches without announcing it publicly. In this way, the token doesn’t fall directly, rather it falls in stages, and then completely becomes worthless. Animoon NFT project is a great example of a soft pull where developers got away with $6.3 million. Examples of notable rug pulls Rugging crypto tokens is not a small event, as when it happens, especially for a big project, everyone in the crypto community starts talking about it. Here we will list some of the most notable rug pulls in the cryptocurrency world so far in 2024 (at the time of writing): Thodex (2021) Thodex was a Turkish cryptocurrency exchange that was responsible for stealing over $2 billion from its users. An excuse for maintenance was made by its founder who then ran away with the funds. Squid Game Token (2021) The Netflix series known as Squid Game was the main catalyst behind the popularity of this token as it rocketed to $2800 in a short period. However, this massive price surge was short-lived as the anonymous project developers drained all liquidity from the project and the price crashed to almost zero in no time. You might also like: Squid Game crypto token scammer tracked by podcasters LUNA (2022) The crypto bear market came along with many bad news but accepting the DeFi token’s LUNA downfall was the hardest thing. While allegations against the owners of the LUNA project haven’t been proven, this crypto project is responsible for giving an estimated loss of $40 billion to the cryptocurrency market. Fintoch (2023) Last year, the promise of high yields lured many users to Fintoch which later vanished with $31 million. All of this happened mainly with the help of fraudulent marketing and endorsements, which further goes to show that all that glitters is not gold. Impact of rug pulls on crypto adoption A rug pull in crypto doesn’t just affect the investors who lost their money, it becomes a dark spot in the crypto world forever. Unlike legacy markets which have been live for many decades, the cryptocurrency market has barely completed a decade. This means that major investors and institutions are still skeptical about cryptocurrencies and such events that involve rugging crypto tokens only increase strict rules for entry, which means less liquidity for the crypto market as a whole. However, in the end, this negative impact of regulations is short-lived as industry-wide regulations become more user-friendly and tighter for such crypto rug pulls become a rare occurrence. How to spot a rug pull? While it can be hard for everyone to spot a rug pull, by following the tips below you can be saved from the majority of rug pulls in the cryptocurrency world. Token supply: Take a closer look at the token supply of the project. If one or a handful of wallets have the majority of the supply then avoid that project. Unrealistic promises: High returns are a sign of early scams in not just crypto but in every financial market. Security audits: Almost every crypto project is audited by a 3rd-party so make sure the crypto project in which you want to invest is properly audited by a reputable company. Teams info: Anonymous developers with no online information is a big red flag, and while some successful meme coins do have anonymous owners, the majority of tokens with anonymous owners have turned out to be scams in the end. How to avoid rug pulls? Spotting a rug pull is the first half of the picture, but how can you avoid them? Here are some practical steps you can take: Use blockchain explorers Evaluate the token’s smart contract and transaction history using applications like Etherscan or BscScan. Developers may be able to alter transactions or create an infinite number of tokens through contracts with “mint” or “owner control” features, so keep an eye on these parameters and avoid those tokens. Look for projects with explicit use cases Reputable projects frequently provide original technology solutions or address pressing issues in the real world. Avoid tokens that have no real use other than manipulating prices, as they can easily run their users. Conduct Extensive Research Research the project in detail, taking note of its roadmap, whitepaper, and token’s purpose. Uncertain objectives or a dearth of thorough documentation are frequently indicators of a hoax. Read user reviews on sites like Telegram, Twitter, and Reddit. A robust, active, and upbeat community is frequently a sign of success. Keeping Up with Scam Patterns Keep abreast of typical cryptocurrency scams and their strategies. Websites such as CoinGecko and CoinMarketcap offer tools to assist you in spotting fraudulent schemes. Resist FOMO Driven by Hype Avoid making an investment based only on celebrity endorsements or social media excitement. Influencers and bots are frequently used by scammers to fabricate excitement about their ventures.

To reduce the anonymity that scammers take advantage of, numerous governments are enacting laws such as required to Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Although it is still difficult to apply these rules to DeFi, they are specifically enforced on centralized platforms. International initiatives aim to create cross-border regulations to combat cryptocurrency fraud, such as those led by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Enforcement is still a major problem, though, particularly in DeFi ecosystems. A safer atmosphere for the adoption of cryptocurrencies is being created by improved investor education and open auditing procedures, which are developing as supplementary tactics to regulatory activities.​ What is a rug pull? A rug pull is when the developers of a crypto project drain all liquidity from the project and run away with the investor funds. Normally, investors don’t get enough time to react to a rug pull, hence it is advisable to do your research before investing in any crypto project. If something seems too good to be true in the crypto world, then it probably is. How to do crypto rug pulls work? Crypto rug pulls work by removing liquidity, token price manipulation, and not allowing investors to withdraw their investments from the crypto project. It is advised to do your research before investing in any token, as both centralized and decentralized exchange tokens can be rugged in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Is crypto rug pull illegal? Yes, rug pulls are a form of fraud and are illegal everywhere. However, it becomes difficult for law enforcement agencies to track the fraudulent developers due to their anonymity from the start. Hence it is advised to only invest in reputable crypto projects that have known founders with a good past track record as well",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/crypto-rug-pull/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37285566.jpeg

Trump stated Sacks will work on a legal framework to give the crypto industry clarity and allow it to thrive in the US. Trump Appoints Crypto Czar Trump announced the news in a post on his Truth Social account, stating that Sacks will work on creating a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry. The crypto czar and other crypto-friendly officials in Trump’s incoming administration, including the incoming Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairs, are expected to reshape US policy on crypto and other digital assets, with help from a newly created crypto advisory council. Trump Stated, “I am pleased to announce that David O. Sacks will be the White House AI and Crypto Czar. In this important role, David will guide the policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard free speech online and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship. He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for and can thrive in the US.” Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures and an early leader of PayPal. Sacks will also lead a White House advisory council on science and technology. Trump’s backers want minimum regulation around technologies such as artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, stating that excessive rules and regulations could throttle innovation. Edal Gil, an entrepreneur and investor in Airbnb and Coinbase, called the selection of Sacks a strong move by Trump. Meanwhile, the founder of Kindred Ventures, Steve Jang, stated, “Sacks will likely have a light touch on regulation, but not without some guardrails.” A Lighter Touch According to Jang, Sacks will prioritize the use of AI in certain crucial applications instead of regulating the development of AI models themselves. This distinction was a key point of conflict for Silicon Valley investors opposed to California’s unsuccessful SB 1047 bill that sought to regulate AI model development. Trump also announced the nomination of Paul Atkins , known for his pro-crypto views as SEC Chair, a move hailed by the crypto industry. Trump’s views on crypto, especially Bitcoin, have changed significantly. The President-elect, who once labeled BTC as a scam, embraced digital assets during his high-profile campaign and promised to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and create a strategic stockpile of BTC. Meanwhile, Matthew Dibb, Chief Investment Officer at Astronaut Capital, called the appointment of Sacks extremely bullish, stating, “David has had somewhat of a hands-on approach to crypto over the years, at times holding coins such as Solana. He appears to be a lot more technically and commercially competent regarding crypto than most would think.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37285618,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623065,1733481780,Traders and Analysts Agree This New Blockchain Could Redefine DeFi in December,"The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is about to be disrupted in ways we’ve never seen before. Traders, financial analysts, and blockchain enthusiasts are abuzz with excitement over a groundbreaking player entering the game this December. Its name? Lightchain AI . With its innovative consensus mechanism, state-of-the-art technology, and community-driven governance, Lightchain is set to redefine what’s possible in DeFi. This blog dives deep into the features powering Lightchain AI, explores its potential applications, and reveals why experts believe it could be the next big thing for Web3 enthusiasts and beyond. What Makes Lightchain a Game-Changer? Lightchain AI isn’t just another blockchain protocol—it’s an entirely new framework that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain infrastructure. At its core are two futuristic technologies: Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Unlike traditional Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) systems that rely on energy-intensive mining or staking tokens, PoI rewards nodes for completing valuable AI computations. Think AI tasks like training models, performing inference, and optimizing algorithms—all while ensuring robust network security. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) : Picture this—a decentralized computational layer that enables seamless execution of AI-specific tasks directly on the blockchain. The AIVM is a dynamic, evolving platform that allows developers to create intelligent, data-driven decentralized applications (dApps) that weren’t possible before. By fusing these revolutionary features, Lightchain is setting the stage for scalable, privacy-focused, and decentralized AI solutions that integrate into DeFi systems like never before. 5 Reasons Why Lightchain is the Future of DeFi 1. Advanced Scalability Meets Efficiency DeFi platforms often struggle with scalability. High transaction fees, slow speeds, and network congestion are common issues. Lightchain’s AIVM handles AI workloads with incredible speed and efficiency, giving it the power to process massive amounts of data while keeping operational costs low. This makes it an attractive solution for enterprise-level DeFi applications. 2. Ethical and Transparent Governance Say goodbye to opaque decision-making. Lightchain employs a decentralized governance model where token holders play an active role. Powered by AI, its Transparent AI Framework ensures auditable and explainable decision-making processes that keep the system accountable. Whether you’re staking or voting on governance proposals, you can trust Lightchain’s integrity. 3. Innovative Use Cases Lightchain isn’t just reshaping DeFi—it’s expanding its horizon. Here are a few ways Lightchain is set to revolutionize multiple industries: Dynamic Liquidity Pools: By embedding AI insights into liquidity pools, Lightchain optimizes token allocation and predicts market shifts to maximize returns for its users. Predictive Market Analytics: Imagine trading on DeFi platforms with access to AI-driven predictions of market trends and asset performance. Secure Tokenized Assets: Lightchain’s infrastructure empowers faster tokenization of assets like real estate or stock derivatives, making them accessible to a broader market. 4. Community-Centric Approach At its core, Lightchain is about people . It leverages decentralized governance systems to ensure that the community helps shape the evolution of the protocol. From proposing updates to voting on critical decisions, token holders drive the platform’s future while gaining from its growth. 5. AI-Powered Security Security breaches have plagued blockchain systems in the past, but Lightchain takes a proactive approach with AI-enhanced protections. Its PoI mechanism identifies unusual activity in real time, ensuring that smart contracts and transactions stay secure. December Presale Launch: What Can We Expect? Lightchain’s December release marks the beginning of a revolution in DeFi. With its Proof of Intelligence unlocking new possibilities for AI-powered decentralization and the AIVM laying down a foundation for intelligent blockchain applications, the excitement is palpable. Early adopters will gain exclusive access to features like the Memecoin Launchpad , designed for creators and investors to collaborate on exciting new token launches. Think of it as the perfect blend of creativity and monetization, secure in Lightchain’s AI-first framework. What Analysts Are Saying Traders and analysts are already weighing in on Lightchain’s potential: “The transition from PoW and PoS to PoI is more than just an upgrade—it’s a paradigm shift in blockchain technology.” – Financial Times Blockchain Review “With its AI-first focus, Lightchain is bridging the gap between advanced computation and decentralized infrastructure.” – DeFi Watchlist “I wouldn’t be surprised if Lightchain sets a precedent for all future DeFi protocols to incorporate AI at their core.” – Crypto Analyst, Mark Jenson How to Get Started with Lightchain Excited yet?

37285181,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107761,1733481599,1inch Team Sells $1.49M in 1INCH Tokens Amid Market Activity,"The 1inch Network , a leading decentralized exchange (DEX), saw its team or investment fund sell 2.823 million 1INCH tokens for 1.496 million USDC , according to on-chain analyst @EmberCN . Over the past 24 hours, the address associated with the team has reportedly sold a total of 10.48 million 1INCH tokens for approximately 5.564 million USDC , at an average sale price of $0.53 per token . Key Details of the Sale 1. Recent Transactions Tokens Sold: 2.823 million 1INCH. Amount Received: 1.496 million USDC. Time of Sale: Approximately 7 hours ago. 2. Total Sales Over 24 Hours Tokens Sold: 10.48 million 1INCH. Amount Received: 5.564 million USDC. Average Sale Price: $0.53 per token. Current Market Performance 1.

Which Altcoin Projects Has He Invested In?,"Donald Trump, who won the presidential election in November, continues to bring Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency supporters to critical points. At this point, Trump announced that he had chosen Paul Atkins as the SEC chairman a few days ago, and now he announced the person he chose as the White House cryptocurrency chief with a post on TruthSocial. Accordingly, Donald Trump has chosen David Sacks as the White House crypto chief. Famous businessman and former PayPal Operations Director David Sacks, who has come to the fore with his cryptocurrency investments, will help create a legal framework for the cryptocurrency sector. Sacks will also be responsible for developments in artificial intelligence, such as crypto. “David will guide the Administration’s policies on Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. Sacks will work on a legal framework so the crypto industry can get the clarity it demands and thrive in the United States,” Trump said. Sacks responded to Trump's post on social media, saying: “Thank you for the President's confidence. I am deeply honored and look forward to promoting the competitiveness of the United States in key technologies. Under your leadership, the future is bright!” It has been revealed that the US White House cryptocurrency manager has invested in multiple crypto projects, including VC firm dYdX. Sacks' venture capital (VC) firm Craft Ventures has reportedly invested in crypto projects including dYdX, Lightning Labs, River Financial, Kresus, Set Protocol, FOLD, Harbor, Handshake, Voltage, Galoy, Lumina, and Rare Bits. *This is not investment advice.

The drop came a day after BTC crossed the historic $100,000 mark, with its market capitalization also shrinking to $1.95 trillion. The drop was in line with the drop in US equities, with the Dow dropping over half a percent. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also finished trading lower, while MicroStrategy reported a sharp drop of over 5%. Markets have been mixed over the past 24 hours, with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) registering notable increases of 1% and 2%. However, other altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR), and others recorded substantial drops. Other major gainers include Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK) , Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT), Uniswap (UNI), Bittensor (TAO), Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), Arbitrum (ARB), Cosmos (ATOM), and Celestia (TIA). The crypto market cap registered a slight decline of 0.71% and currently sits at $3.59 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) Retreats From Record Levels Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below $95,000, falling sharply from record highs before recovering and returning to its current levels. The drop comes in line with a fall in US equities, with the Dow giving up more than half a percent. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also ended the day lower, while MicroStrategy reported a drop of over 5%. BTC had surged past $100,000 and set a new all-time high after President-elect Donald Trump chose Paul Atkins as his pick for Securities and Exchange Commission Chair. Atkins is known for his pro-crypto views, and markets are hopeful of a less aggressive approach under his leadership. BTC has risen almost 50% since Trump’s victory thanks to greater institutional interest and inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Geoff Kendrink from StanChart London stated, “Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money.” What Next For Bitcoin (BTC)? Bitcoin (BTC) rocketed past $100,000 to set a new all-time high of $103.604. Market watchers are now wondering if it can go any higher or if its notorious volatility can drag the price lower. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called BTC crossing the milestone a “magic moment,” linking it to Donald Trump’s victory. Trump also took to social media to celebrate the milestone. BTC’s latest rally and move past $100,000 was ignited by Trump’s pick for Gary Gensler’s replacement, former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, known for his pro-crypto views. “Clearly there is anticipation that the new administration is going to be somewhat more favorable to crypto than the old administration was. So for the price of Bitcoin, I think that that's what's driven the trend so far [and it will] likely continue into the new year.” However, some analysts warned investors of BTC’s inherent volatility and wild price swings. “A lot of people have gotten rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn’t suitable for everyone. It’s volatile, unpredictable, and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.” Trump Picks Former PayPal COO As White House Crypto Czar President-elect Donald Trump has appointed former PayPal COO David Sacks as the White House AI and Crypto Czar. Sacks will lead policy in crucial tech areas, focus on American competitiveness, free speech, and countering Big Tech bias. Trump posted on Truth Social, “I am pleased to announce that David O. Sacks will be the White House AI and Crypto Czar. In this important role, David will guide the policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard free speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) finally hit the haloed $100,000 mark on Thursday, surging to a new all-time high of $103,900, marking a historic moment for the cryptocurrency and the crypto ecosystem. The milestone represents a staggering increase of almost 130% over BTC’s January price of around $45,000. However, the price has retreated considerably after hitting this historic milestone and is currently down by 4.50% and trading just above $98,000. The dip saw BTC drop to a low of $94,035 before rebounding to its current levels. BTC’s latest rally has been fueled by growing institutional adoption and market optimism following Donald Trump’s victory and surging spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Institutional interest has been one of the biggest drivers for BTC’s growth. Institutional interest can be gauged by looking at MicroStrategy, already the largest corporate holder of the asset. The Michael Saylor-led firm’s latest acquisition saw the firm purchase 15,400 BTC valued at $1.5 billion at current prices. The latest purchase brings its total BTC holdings to a staggering 402,100 BTC, valued at over $100 billion. Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have also been crucial in driving the rally. November saw a staggering $6.1 billion in ETF inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin trust accounting for $5.4 billion. Trump’s election victory has also boosted market sentiment due to his pro-crypto stance. The President-elect also chose Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair, fueling speculation about a crypto-friendly administration under Trump. The price action shows BTC’s move past $100,000 on Thursday, a day when it witnessed considerable volatility despite hitting a historical milestone. BTC ended the previous week positively, registering an increase of almost 2% on Friday and settling at $97,374. However, it fell back in the red on Saturday, dropping 1.14% to $96,263. Despite sellers attempting to take control, BTC recovered on Sunday to end the weekend in positive territory, up by almost 1% at $97,026. BTC started the current week in the red as sellers attempted to drag the price below the 20-day SMA. As a result, the price fell to a low of $94,404 before settling at $95,812 after a decline of 1.25%. Source: TradingView Sellers drove BTC to a low of $93,665 on Tuesday as it briefly slipped below the 200-day SMA. However, buyers countered the selling pressure and BTC recovered, ultimately registering only a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC registered an increase of almost 3% to settle at $98,581. BTC created history on Thursday as it surged past the $100,000 mark to set a new all-time high of $103,900. However, it also saw significant volatility as prices plummeted from this level. As a result, BTC dipped to a low of $92,285 before recovering to settle at $97,093, a drop of 1.51%. The current session sees BTC up by 1.35% as buyers look to reclaim $100,000. The asset is currently trading at $98,396. With the RSI climbing into the overbought zone, a drop was expected in the short term. However, analysts expect BTC to recover and go back above $100,000 during the next few sessions. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is looking to test $4,000 despite facing significant volatility on Thursday despite reaching an intraday high of $3,957. ETH began the week positively, registering a marginal increase on Friday and moving to $3,594. Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as ETH registered a rise of just over 3% to settle at $3,705. With sellers active at this level, ETH could only register a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $3,710. The current week began with a substantial drop on Monday as the price dropped almost 2% to hit a low of $3,559 before settling at $3,645. Sellers drove ETH to an intraday low of $3,504 on Tuesday. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $3,618, ultimately registering a drop of 0.74%. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment returned Wednesday as ETH rallied over 6% to move above $3,800 and settle at $3,844. The price experienced considerable volatility on Thursday as buyers attempted to go past $4,000 and sellers attempted to drag the price towards $3,500. As a result, ETH reached an intraday high of $3,957 and fell to a low of $3,652 before settling at $3,787, a decline of 1.48%. The current session sees ETH up over 3% as it looks to go above $4,000. If buyers can breach this level, ETH could move to $4,200 or higher. On the other hand, if sellers regain control, ETH could drop towards $3,500, where it could find support. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is attempting to stage a recovery and push above $250. However, any recovery hinges on whether SOL can move above the 20-day SMA. Despite registering a substantial increase of 2.41% on Friday, SOL fell into bearish territory on Saturday, registering a drop of 2.33% and settling at $237. Sellers retained control on Sunday as SOL registered a marginal decline to settle at $237. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL fell below the 20-day SMA after registering a drop of almost 5% and settling at $225. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as sellers drove SOL to a low of $215. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of almost 4% and settle at $234. Source: TradingView SOL fell back in the red on Wednesday after failing to move above the 20-day SMA. SOL reached an intraday high of $241 before falling back, registering a drop of almost 2% to settle at $229. Sellers attempted to drive SOL below $220 on Wednesday as it plummeted to a low of $222. However, it recovered as buyers propped up the price. As a result, SOL registered an increase of almost 3% and settled at $236. The current session sees SOL up by nearly 2% as buyers try to push the price above the 20-day SMA. If SOL can go above the moving average, it could retest the resistance at $260. On the other hand, if sellers retake control, SOL could drop to $220. If this level is breached, the price could fall as low as $200. Litecoin (LTC) Price Analysis Litecoin (LTC) has been incredibly bullish this week, setting its sights on $150. However, it must overcome considerable resistance to reach this level. LTC’s rally began on Friday when it registered a substantial increase of nearly 10% to go above $100 and settle at $104. Buyers attempted to drive the price back below $100 on Saturday but were unsuccessful as LTC remained above $100, settling at $102 after a drop of 1.90%. Bullish sentiment intensified considerably on Sunday as LTC surged almost 17% to settle at $119. Buyers retained control on Monday, pushing LTC up nearly 11% to $132. LTC also reached an intraday high of $139 as buyers set their sights on $150. Source: TradingView Despite a strong showing on Sunday and Monday, LTC fell into the red on Tuesday as sellers drove it to an intraday low of $121. LTC made somewhat of a recovery from this level to settle at $130, ultimately registering a decline of 1.41%. Volatility persisted on Wednesday as LTC fell to $121 again. However, buyers took control, allowing LTC to register an increase of 2.21% and settle at $133. LTC saw a significant uptick in volatility on Thursday, dropping to an intraday low of $125 and rising to an intraday high of $147 before settling at $135 after an increase of 1.44%. The current session sees LTC down by just over 1% as sellers look to drive the price towards $100. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano (ADA)’s rally has stalled this week as it failed to establish itself above $1.30, declining considerably to slip below $1.20 during the current session. ADA has been bullish since the middle of last week, recovering from an intraday low of $0.875 on Tuesday. By Friday, it was back above $1 and trading at $1.07. Buyers retained control over the weekend as ADA registered a marginal increase on Saturday before rising almost 7% on Sunday to go above $1.10 and settle at $1.15. Sellers attempted to drive ADA below $1 on Monday as it plummeted to an intraday low of $1.05. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 4.43% and settled $1.20. Source: TradingView ADA surged to an intraday high of $1.32 on Tuesday as it began the session on a bullish note. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, the price fell back to $1.19 as sellers dragged the price lower. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as ADA faced considerable volatility, with the price ultimately registering a marginal decline. Bearish sentiment increased slightly on Thursday as ADA dropped 2.27% to $1.16. The current session sees ADA up by almost 1% as buyers attempt to reverse the recent bearish sentiment. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB)’s rally has stalled around $1.15 as buyers struggle to build momentum.

37284690,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107741,1733480733,India Uncovers $97M in Unpaid Taxes by Crypto Exchanges,"The Indian government has uncovered approximately 824 crore INR ($97 million) in unpaid Goods and Services Taxes (GST) owed by several major cryptocurrency exchanges , including Binance, WazirX, CoinDCX , and CoinSwitch Kuber . The revelation marks a significant development in India’s regulatory landscape, as authorities tighten scrutiny over the rapidly growing cryptocurrency industry. Major Crypto Exchanges Under Scrutiny 1. Binance’s Ongoing Hearings A spokesperson for Binance stated that the exchange is working closely with Indian regulatory authorities: “We are attending necessary hearings to address any concerns.” This follows a prior demand in August 2024 , when Indian law enforcement required Binance to pay 722 crore INR ($85 million) in unpaid taxes. 2. Other Exchanges Involved Prominent Indian crypto exchanges, such as WazirX , CoinDCX , and CoinSwitch Kuber , are also implicated in the government’s findings. Unpaid Taxes: What Does This Mean? 1. Breakdown of the Issue The government’s investigation reveals that these exchanges failed to pay the required GST on transactions and services, which constitutes a major violation of Indian tax laws. Total Unpaid Amount: 824 crore INR ($97 million). Primary Focus: Ensuring compliance and recovery of dues. 2. Ripple Effects on the Crypto Industry The crackdown sends a clear signal that: Regulators are watching: Cryptocurrency firms must adhere to tax laws. Greater oversight is coming: Authorities are likely to enforce stricter regulations on digital assets. India’s Stance on Crypto Regulations 1. A History of Scrutiny The Indian government has maintained a cautious stance toward cryptocurrencies: Proposed a blanket ban in 2019. Introduced a 30% tax on crypto gains in 2022. 2. The Role of GST in Crypto Transactions Cryptocurrency exchanges in India are required to pay 18% GST on trading fees and commissions, among other taxable activities. Impact on Crypto Exchanges 1. Financial Burden The tax demand represents a significant financial liability for exchanges, potentially impacting: Profit margins. Operational costs. 2. Industry Reputation Non-compliance with tax regulations may tarnish the reputation of Indian crypto exchanges, both domestically and internationally. What’s Next for Indian Crypto Exchanges? 1. Increased Regulatory Oversight The government’s findings could lead to: Stricter compliance checks. Heavier penalties for non-compliance in the future. 2. Collaboration with Authorities Exchanges like Binance have expressed their willingness to cooperate, indicating a shift toward regulatory alignment. Conclusion The discovery of $97 million in unpaid taxes by major Indian cryptocurrency exchanges underscores the growing focus on compliance and regulation in the crypto industry. While this crackdown may pose short-term challenges, it also reflects the government’s intent to bring greater transparency and accountability to the sector. As the crypto landscape evolves in India, both regulators and industry players must work collaboratively to ensure sustainable growth and legal adherence.

Falling under the R1 pivot level at $1.2526, the Cardano price is currently moving above the broken trendline. The current market price of Cardano is $1.16, with a 1.67% drop in the past 4 hours. This creates a bearish candle, completing an evening star. This increases the chances of a breakdown rally to test the center pivot level at $1.06. Technical Indicators: MACD : Amid the increased selling pressure, the MACD and signal lines have given a bearish crossover and maintain a declining trend. Will Cardano Hit $1.247?

BlackRock and MARA Holdings led the charge, accumulating a combined 9,173 BTC, worth nearly $897 million at the time of purchase. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, acquired a staggering 7,750 BTC. This purchase, driven by strong demand for its spot Bitcoin ETFs , brings the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to $48.9 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence. Thomas Fahrer, founder of Apollo, described BlackRock’s ETF as the “fastest-growing ETF ever.” Meanwhile, mining giant MARA Holdings added 1,423 BTC to its treasury over two days. The acquisitions followed the firm’s $850 million convertible note offering, which was earmarked for expanding Bitcoin reserves. MARA now holds 22,108 Bitcoin , valued at $2.17 billion—a significant 162% increase from its holdings just a month ago. The company recently adopted a policy to retain all mined crypto and leverage capital market strategies akin to MicroStrategy’s approach. Capitalizing the Bitcoin Dip An anonymous crypto whale also took advantage of the price dip, purchasing 600 BTC worth $58.9 million, according to Lookonchain. This wallet, which had no Bitcoin holdings before November 24, now shows signs of strategic accumulation. Health-tech firm Semler Scientific joined the Bitcoin-stacking spree, buying 303 BTC at an average price of $96,779 on December 4. This acquisition pushed its holdings to 1,873 BTC, valued at $182.8 million. Publicly listed BTC-holding firms collectively own 527,026 BTC, representing 2.66% of the cryptocurrency’s current supply. Private firms and asset managers follow with holdings of 410,418 BTC and 1,253 BTC, respectively. Institutional Confidence Amid Market Volatility Despite a 4.9% price decline over 24 hours, Bitcoin’s institutional demand underscores growing confidence in the asset’s long-term value. With firms like BlackRock and MARA leading acquisitions, the trend of corporate Bitcoin stacking appears resilient, even as market fluctuations test retail and institutional sentiment. As BTC traded at $97,580 at the time of writing, the accumulation by major players hints at strategic positioning.

Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that there “literally couldn’t be a more bullish long-term chart” than that of Solana ( SOL ) on the weekly time frame. “When it breaks higher, it’s going to ACCELERATE.” Source: Raoul Pal/X Based on Pal’s one-week chart, it appears that the macro guru is suggesting that Solana broke out of a descending channel and is now targeting to go above the resistance level around the all-time high price of just above $260. Solana is trading at $240 at time of writing. Next up is Ethereum. According to the former Goldman Sachs executive, Ethereum will experience a “spectacular” rally if and when it breaks out above the upper boundary of a symmetrical triangle pattern that has formed on the weekly time frame. In technical analysis, a symmetrical triangle pattern is bullish if the price breaks out of the upper border. According to Pal, Ethereum has two options going forward. “Maybe it pulls back first to gather steam or maybe it sails straight through.” Source: Raoul Pal/X Ethereum is trading at $3,913 at time of writing.

37284376,https://crypto.news/?p=14316805,1733480029,"Bitcoin’s surge signals potential market ‘overshoot,’ BofA strategist warns","With Bitcoin briefly surpassing $100,000 and the S&P 500 posting its best year since 2019, Bank of America’s strategist warns of a potential market overshoot. U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies are showing signs of overheating, with Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett warning of a potential “overshoot” in early 2025, Bloomberg reports . The S&P 500’s price-to-book ratio surged to 5.3 times in 2024, nearing a peak of 5.5 seen during the dot-com bubble in March 2000. Hartnett cautioned that if the index approaches 6,666 points — about 10% above current levels — the rally could overextend. Yet, despite this, the bank’s bull-and-bear indicator shows no signs of excessive optimism among global investors, the report notes. The S&P 500 has gained about 27% this year, which seems to be its best year since 2019. For Bitcoin ( BTC ), it seems that Trump’s support for crypto fueled optimism and gave confidence to investors seeking gains on risk assets, which helped drive Bitcoin past $100,000 earlier this week. With a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, Bitcoin now ranks as the 11th largest economy in the world, Hartnett noted.

Mike Novogratz, head of digital crypto bank Galaxy Digital, has also expressed caution amid Bitcoin’s surge. He warned that the crypto community is “levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction,” adding that leveraged stocks, such as MicroStrategy, could also experience significant downturns. Placeholder partner Chris Burniske also urges a cautious approach , advising investors to balance optimism with realism to avoid overhyping market targets. Reflecting on past cycles, Burniske cautioned that Bitcoin’s brief surge past $100,000 may not be sustainable in the short term. He pointed to the 2021 bull market, where inflated expectations fell short, with Bitcoin capping out at $70,000 instead of the anticipated $100,000.

37284151,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623619,1733479667,Bitcoin will dethrone gold as top store of value in the next decade: Bernstein,"Bitcoin is on track to replace gold as the leading store of value within the next ten years, according to Bernstein. The firm’s analysts expect Bitcoin to become a core component of institutional asset allocations and corporate treasuries. Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein, wrote, “We expect Bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier ‘store of value’ asset eventually replacing gold.” This prediction comes as Bitcoin surges past the $100,000 mark for the first time, driven by a 141% surge in 2024 alone. The historic rally picked up steam after the U.S. presidential election on November 5, with investors betting on the incoming Trump administration to adopt policies favorable to the crypto industry. Bernstein projects Bitcoin will reach $200,000 by late 2025. Bitcoin kickstarts long-awaited bull run Bitcoin broke through the $100,000 barrier late Wednesday night, reaching a peak of $103,844.05. By Thursday afternoon, it pulled back slightly to $99,140.00, according to Coin Metrics. The rally has been fueled by institutional support and political developments, including Trump’s plan to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler with Paul Atkins . Gary is viewed as a major obstacle to the sector’s growth. Trump’s announcement energized the market, as did his post on Truth Social, where he took credit for Bitcoin’s milestone. “You’re welcome,” he wrote. His administration promises to push for policies to support Bitcoin’s growth, such as removing taxes on crypto transactions and creating a national Bitcoin reserve. Bernstein isn’t alone in its optimism. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson called Bitcoin a low-correlation asset that could replace gold as a hedge against economic instability. “Bitcoin’s main application right now is as a store of value,” Luria said . However, he did point out that Bitcoin’s price still moves more in line with risk assets than gold does, making it less stable as a hedge. Luria attributed Bitcoin’s growth to its adoption rate rather than macroeconomic factors. Employment, regulation , tax policy, and globalization all play a role in shaping Bitcoin’s value. Despite its rising profile, Luria acknowledged that Bitcoin still has hurdles to clear before it can function as a widely accepted medium of exchange or unit of account. “There is still a long path ahead,” he said. Bitcoin is here to stay The roots of Bitcoin’s appeal lie in its origins during the 2008 financial crisis. Created as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, Bitcoin promised a way to bypass banks and governments. Satoshi Nakamoto ’s Bitcoin Whitepaper described it as “peer-to-peer electronic cash,” laying the groundwork for what has now become a 2 trillion-dollar market. Over the years, Bitcoin has endured skepticism, hostility, and regulatory crackdowns, but its resilience has made it a favorite among both retail and institutional investors. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, called the $100,000 milestone a “paradigm shift.” He pointed to the pro-crypto policies expected under Trump as a key driver of Bitcoin’s continued success. While Novogratz warned that Bitcoin’s price won’t always move in a straight line upward, he remains bullish on its long-term potential. Bitcoin is now up more than 133% for the year, with a 42% gain since the November election. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell weighed in on Bitcoin’s role in the financial ecosystem during the DealBook conference. “Bitcoin is just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” Powell said, adding that it competes with gold rather than traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. It’s not exactly an endorsement, but it’s the closest we can get to when it comes to Powell.

While Solana and XRP ETFs are expected to be approved, FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reported that the SEC is preparing to reject spot SOL ETF applications. Terrett, who posted from his X account, said that the current U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has notified at least two SOL spot ETF applicants that their 19/b-4 filings will be rejected. Terrett also cited sources as saying that no new cryptocurrency ETF applications will be approved during the current SEC administration. “SPECIAL NEWS: I have confirmed that the SEC has notified at least two of the five potential issuers that it will reject their 19/b-4 applications for spot Solana ETFs. “From what I’ve been told, the consensus here is that the SEC will not approve any new cryptocurrency ETFs under the current administration.” This development from the SEC has senior analysts not expecting a major move until Paul Atkins became the US SEC Chairman in January. Speaking about the development in Solana ETFs, ETF Store President Nate Geraci said: “Not surprising, but there will be no movement on spot crypto ETF applications until there is a new SEC chairman… Lame duck.” Solana continues to trade at $238. *This is not investment advice.

37292543,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104157,1733478921,Newly Appointed White House Crypto Czar’s XRP Ruling Remarks Resurface,"A video of David Sacks commenting on the July 2023 ruling in the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit goes viral within the XRP community after his appointment as White House AI and Crypto Czar. Famous XRP community figure Cowboy shared the video on X immediately after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump appointed Sacks as Crypto Czar.Sacks Says Ripple Won SEC Lawsuit Sacks commented on the Ripple/XRP verdict during his appearance on the All-In Podcast on July 14, 2023, a day after Judge Torres released her summary judgment decision.During the podcast, Sacks pointed out that Ripple won the lawsuit, indicating that the judge held that its sales of XRP do not constitute offers in investment contracts. He asserted that the ruling vindicated Ripple. This suggests that the ruling validates Ripple’s arguments that XRP is not a security and should not be subject to the SEC’s scrutiny. Furthermore, Sacks highlighted XRP’s significant gains following the verdict, stating that the coin’s price has skyrocketed by 35% in reaction to the ruling. Court Ruling Exonerated Ripple However, Jason, one of the hosts of the All-In Podcast, refuted the claim, suggesting that Ripple did not secure a landslide victory against the SEC. According to him, the judge only held that Ripple’s sales on digital exchanges do not constitute investment contracts. However, its offers and sales of XRP to sophisticated investors were deemed securities. Nonetheless, Sachs maintained that the ruling exonerated Ripple of the SEC’s claims. Meanwhile, in a separate X post, Sacks characterized the ruling as a big win for crypto. https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1679563342870896641?t=JMuC0cvsyJaf5QmsM4f3Pw&s=19SEC Seeks to Appeal Ripple Victory Meanwhile, the U.S. SEC refused to accept Judge Torres’ decision on Ripple’s programmatic sales and other distributions of XRP. Consequently, it filed an appeal, seeking to overturn the judgment in the Second Circuit. The SEC is expected to file its appeal brief on January 15, 2025, five days before Trump’s inauguration. Interestingly, crypto enthusiasts are optimistic that Trump’s administration will create favorable regulations for the industry. This speculation has gained momentum recently, especially as Trump appoints several pro-crypto advocates to fill top positions, ranging from the SEC to the Treasury Secretary. Additionally, Sacks will lead the White House efforts to provide clear rules for the American crypto industry, potentially making the U.S. the global leader in this sector. Amid the appointment of several crypto advocates into key positions, speculation indicates that the SEC might drop its lawsuit against Ripple, potentially ending any regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP.This speculation contributed immensely to XRP’s recent spike to $2.86 this week. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.30, up 43.57% in seven days.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/06/newly-appointed-white-house-crypto-czars-ripple-ruling-remarks-resurface/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=newly-appointed-white-house-crypto-czars-ripple-ruling-remarks-resurface,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market has positively influenced many cryptos, especially those with high market capitalisation. Meanwhile, most experts confirm the beginning of the Alt Season. Unsurprisingly, crypto enthusiasts are eager to know what is next for cryptocurrencies in 2025. Bitcoin Halving Pattern and Price Predictions In the previous halving cycle, which began on May 11, 2020, and ended on April 19, 2024, the Bitcoin market experienced a surge of approximately 645.68%. At the beginning of the current cycle, the BTC price stood at around $63762.59. So far, in the current cycle, the market has showcased an increase of 53.8%. Experts project $120K as a reasonable target for Bitcoin in 2025. They also acknowledge the possibility of the price hitting $150K. However, they believe the highest the price can reach next year is $200K. Institutional Accumulation and Puell Multiple Outlook Experts note that the Puell Multiple chart, a metric for estimating the level of sell pressure in the market coming from miners, supports the assessment of Bitcoin going up to at least $120K next year. Currently, the Puell Multiple index stands at 1.241. At the start of this month, it stood at 1.76. On April 20, it hit a yearly peak of 2.77. On September 11, it touched a low of 0.48. Notably, in November, it fluctuated within the range of 1.3 and 0.93. Experts also emphasise the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Retests $4k, These ETH-based Altcoins To Rally Next? , Global Political Shift Towards Crypto In the latest US presidential election, pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump attained a massive victory over the ruling Democratic government, which had launched several regulatory crackdowns against the cryptocurrency industry. Recently, Trump announced his decision to nominate pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the successor of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who had invited the ire of the crypto community for his tougher regulatory approach. Since the US political landscape tilted towards the pro-crypto side, many global leaders have openly expressed their support for the crypto sector, especially Bitcoin. Recently, Russian president Vladimir Putin stated that it is impossible to ban Bitcoin and his country cannot ignore new technologies like digital currencies. Interestingly, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, while answering whether the rising interest in Bitcoin can be perceived as an indication of the emerging lack of trust in the US dollar, stated that Bitcoin poses no threat to the US dollar but competes with gold. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37284899,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51504,1733478416,3 Coins Below $0.5 That Will Outperform Ethereum (ETH) in Profits During the Coming Bull Run,"When the bull market comes into the crypto world, risk-averse investors usually look to invest in low-cap alts that have a sustainable ecosystem and use case. Ethereum (ETH) is still a powerhouse within the blockchain sphere, but its current established position means little room for growth. Those who wish to get much higher returns could use Rexas Finance (RXS), XRP (Ripple), and Hedera (HBAR), all of which have promising returns with little investment. Of these, Rexas Finance is focused on building an entire ecosystem that will transform the existing markets and utilize blockchain technology completely differently. Rexas Finance (RXS): Facilitating Real-World Tokenization and Blockchain Integration Rexas Finance actively participates in bridging the realms of traditional finance and blockchain, with this as its core business model. Its primary objective of real-world asset tokenization (RWA) distinguishes it from speculative tokens, producing relevant applications that eliminate problems in the old system. The Rexas QuickMint Bot fast-tracks the process of creating the token for the user and business in order to easily convert a real-world asset like real estate or art into a token, even without much knowledge of blockchain. At the same time, the Rexas Treasury is a multi-chain yield aggregator which utilizes machine-learning algorithms to discover and automatically compound high-yield opportunities. For first-time investors or experienced market players, this platform provides effortless access to returns from multiple blockchains, thereby increasing accessibility to and profitability for DeFi.’ In its Stage 9 presale, RXS is now priced at $0.125, having sold out $291,618,559 of its total supply of $335,000,000. This opens up investment opportunities for users, listing not less than $0.2; thus, the price should multiply further because the project should begin to build momentum. Why RXS Is Expected to Beat ETH Also in Popularity Even though Ethereum is notoriously over $1,000, which makes it hard to become ten-fold or one thousand times ETH, RXS has a low price but untapped upside potential. It offers great solutions for RWA tokenization and is constantly expanding its ecosystem, which means there continues to be demand for the token. XRP (Ripple): Redefining the Cross-Border Payments Ecosystem XRP, a native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, is an established token mainly focused on cross-border payments. Ripple’s vision of allowing people to transfer money across borders quickly and at minimal cost has earned the thoughts of many financial entities with the help of XRP, which has become successful with utility endorsement. XRP has always been a significant token in global payments, and the token appears to be in the spotlight. After victory in court battles, followers’ interest in the token has recently been revived, along with efficient, low-cost, and fast transaction capabilities that draw banks’ attention worldwide . Hedera (HBAR): Scalable Enterprise Blockchain Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is a fast, secure, and scalable platform specifically designed for enterprise use across industries. The platform is based on a hash graph technology-integrated consensus mechanism, which enables the network to be significantly more powerful than traditional blockchains. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) has an extraordinarily positive market perception and is backed by Google, IBM, and Boeing, which makes it an enterprise-grade blockchain. It also has an eco-friendly consensus mechanism that is desirable for projects aimed at a more environmentally friendly world. Conclusion Any investor looking for altcoins that can create some wealth during the next bull run should seriously consider Rexas Finance (RXS), XRP, and Hedera (HBAR) down to the last detail. The RXS case looks particularly promising because of the variety of solutions present in the ecosystem; the price is currently at $0.125, which gives one a chance to have a decent entry point and the potential to grow exponentially in value. Although Ethereum is still a key player in this industry, it is currently priced high, and the market is oversaturated, so it is less likely to provide great returns. New projects such as Rexas Finance, Ripple, and Hedera are exceptionally placed to benefit from blockchain’s technological advancement and offer reasonably priced services with great potential. For those prepared to ride the wave of the next cryptocurrency boom, these three coins might prove to be flipping coins.

37283433,https://coinpaper.com/6404/usdc-becomes-first-stablecoin-to-meet-canada-s-new-regulations,1733478345,USDC Becomes First Stablecoin to Meet Canada’s New Regulations,"USDC’s compliance with these regulations allows it to continue being listed on Canadian platforms beyond the Dec. 31, 2024 compliance deadline. Ripple is finalizing the launch of its RLUSD stablecoin, pending NYDFS approval. Meanwhile, Singapore-based Dtcpay is transitioning to a stablecoin-only model by 2025, focusing on USDC, USDt, FDUSD, and WUSD to improve payment reliability and scalability. Chainalysis, under its new CEO Jonathan Levin, also expects some stablecoin regulatory clarity by 2025. USDC Becomes First to Meet Canada’s New Listing Rules Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, announced that its United States dollar-pegged token achieved compliance with Canada's forthcoming listing requirements set by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). This milestone positions USDC as the first stablecoin to meet the criteria under the CSA’s Value-Referenced Crypto Asset (VCRA) framework, which allows it to remain listed on licensed Canadian crypto trading platforms beyond the Dec. 31, 2024 compliance deadline. The VCRA classification applies to crypto assets that are designed to maintain a stable value by referencing fiat currencies, other values, or a combination thereof. Circle’s compliance was also solidified through its alignment with the Ontario Securities Commission's regulations. The company is led by Jeremy Allaire, and he believes in the potential for USDC to better cross-border payments and improve Canada’s retail and institutional settlement systems by offering lower transaction costs, increased consumer protections, reduced settlement risks, and heightened competition in payments. This latest development is part of Circle’s broader global expansion, which includes its French subsidiary achieving compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. This allows it to issue both USDC and the euro-backed stablecoin, Euro Coin (EURC), across the EU. In Asia, Circle’s Singaporean subsidiary received a payment institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore in June of 2023. Currently, USDC holds a market cap of more than $40.3 billion, trailing only Tether (USDT) in the $201.2 billion stablecoin market . Top stablecoins by market cap (Source: CoinGecko ) Vancouver’s mayor, Ken Sim, also recently revealed plans for the city to start adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet as part of a strategy to diversify investments. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like a fiat currency (like the US dollar), a commodity (like gold), or a combination of assets. These coins achieve stability through mechanisms like full backing by reserves or algorithmic adjustments to their supply. Stablecoins are often used in digital transactions, and they offer a more reliable and less volatile alternative for payments, savings, and trading in the crypto ecosystem. New Chainalysis CEO Expects Stablecoin Regulation Clarity in 2025 Chainalysis recently appointed Jonathan Levin, its chief strategy officer and co-founder, as its new CEO after the departure of Michael Gronager in October. Levin assumed the role on Dec. 3, which was announced in a Dec. 5 statement. The company also welcomed Paul Auvil, former chief financial officer at Proofpoint, as an independent director on its board. Under Levin’s leadership, Chainalysis plans to expand its international presence, and to enhance protections for cryptocurrency users globally as well as develop private-sector solutions for digital asset custody. Levin shared that while policymakers are unlikely to change their approach to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and national security concerns, he hopes to see more clarity on stablecoin regulations, particularly concerning their issuance, redemption, and regulatory oversight. In October, Chainalysis reported a surge in Bitcoin transactions in the United States after the approval of more spot crypto exchange-traded funds. On the other hand, it also noted a decline in stablecoin activity compared to other countries. The share of stablecoin transactions on U.S.-regulated exchanges dropped from about 50% in 2023 to under 40% in 2024. However, Levin expects some major regulatory developments in the United States, including the potential repeal of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which mandates financial institutions to account for customers’ digital assets on their balance sheets. Although lawmakers voted to overturn the rule, it was vetoed by President Joe Biden in May. Levin also expects more detailed guidance and no-action letters addressing new crypto applications and tokens. RLUSD Stablecoin Awaits NYDFS Approval Ripple has been at the forefront of stablecoin news lately, and the company finally addressed the speculation surrounding the anticipated launch of its RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple clarified that the token did not launch on Dec. 4 as rumored. In a statement on X, Ripple confirmed that RLUSD’s release is still pending final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The company plans to work very closely with the regulator to meet the highest standards before proceeding with the launch. RLUSD is a 1:1 U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and will be fully backed by dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasury securities, and cash equivalents. Since August, the stablecoin has undergone beta testing on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnet. Ripple has plans to expand RLUSD’s reach to additional blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and the stablecoin is designed to complement and enhance XRP within Ripple’s ecosystem. Ripple shared that it will provide updates as they become available. The crypto community is very eagerly awaiting the launch but has been warned to remain vigilant against potential scams. Ripple itself also warned people about an increase in fraudulent activity, and reminded users that it will never request XRP or solicit funds from them. Dtcpay Shifts to Stablecoin-Only Transactions Dtcpay, a Singapore-licensed crypto payment platform, announced plans to phase out support for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) in favor of a stablecoin-only model. The transition is set to be completed by January of 2025, and will focus on supporting stablecoins like Tether’s USDt, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), First Digital USD (FDUSD), and Worldwide USD (WUSD). The move aligns with Dtcpay’s mission to provide a more reliable, scalable, and secure payment experience, as stablecoins already account for a large chunk of its transaction volume. Dtcpay was launched in 2019 and was formerly known as Digital Treasures Center. It secured a major payment institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 2022, which allowed it to offer digital payment token (DPT) services.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/doge-christmas-dogechris-solana-memecoin-to-rally-15000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-bonk-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

However, crypto enthusiasts remain hopeful of a change when SEC chairman Gary Gensler leaves office in January 2025. As reported by Fox Business correspondent Eleanor Terrett, the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) will be rejecting at least two of the five Solana (SOL) spot ETFs 19b-4 filings. Terrett shared the news on her X account, adding that the financial watchdog’s general consensus is that ETFs will no longer be approved under the outgoing administration. In a response to their post, a user asked if there’s a likelihood of one Solana ETF being approved, to which the journalist replied, “The SEC won’t approve just one or a couple and not the others. Remember the bitcoin ETFs? Eleven launched on the same day.” Source: X _Many investors worry about what will become of Solana as other crypto coins get their ETFs approved. Is Solana missing out? Or the coin and it’s blockchain are okay as they are? Investors still hopeful of a future Solana ETF approval Across several social media platforms, the crypto community showered blame on the regulatory views of Joe Biden’s administration and SEC chair Gary Gensler. Crypto supporters believe the current regime used too much bureaucracy in the regulatory landscape of digital currencies. Nate Geraci, president and co-founder of The ETF Institute, believes the approval of new crypto spot ETFs was highly unlikely after Donald Trump’s presidential elections victory. “No surprise, but won’t be any movement on spot crypto ETF filings until new leadership is in place.” Geraci remarked. Several pro-crypto advocates on X are hopeful spot crypto ETF applications will be approved when Donald Trump enters office in January next year. Moreover, they expect the stringent regulatory landscape will loosen up when incoming US SEC chair Paul Atkins takes charge. One user expressed their belief that everything the SEC opposes will be authorized after Trump’s inauguration. They went on to say there’s no sense of delaying it for a couple months other than toying with the crypto community’s emotions. Source: X The current battle for SOL and XRP ETFs is what was in the days of BTC and ETH ETFs. Many are taunting that under Trump, many more altcoin ETFs will take market root because of the promise he made once he took office as POTUS. Bitcoin, and Ether ETFs performances show Solana investors missing out on profits The US spot Bitcoin ETFs have amassed remarkable inflows and growth milestones, collectively attracting over $17 billion in net inflows within nine months. Over the last couple of months, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has led the Bitcoin ETF inflows charge, currently boasting over $50 billion in assets under management, per CoinGlass data . Recent updates from CoinGlass also reveal a significant surge in inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. On December 3 alone, these funds recorded $675.97 million in inflows, a 90% increase from the $353.67 million seen the previous day. This marked the fourth consecutive day of net inflows, totaling over $1.45 billion during this period. BlackRock’s IBIT witnessed $693.25 million in single-day inflows, bringing its holdings to over 500,000 BTC. The fund now accounts for approximately 2.38% of Bitcoin’s total supply and has nearly $50 billion in assets under management, solidifying its position among the top ETF launches of 2024. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $52.17 million, while VanEck’s HODL and Bitwise’s BITB secured $16.21 million and $7.8 million, respectively. In the Ether space, spot ETFs have seen net inflows reach $1.3 billion since their launch in July 2024. That said, Ethereum spot ETFs have faced several challenges in FY 2024, including restrictions on staking and options trading and limited distribution through major brokerages. Source: X Without ETF approval, Solana investors continue missing out on the substantial inflows and institutional attention enjoyed by Bitcoin and Ethereum. If a Solana ETF is not approved soon, this could hinder SOL’s acceptance in traditional investment portfolios, potentially negatively impacting growth and price trends. At the time of writing, Solana’s price is hovering around the $237-$240 region, up 2% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko updates . Analysts believe the price could gain ground to $290 if the coin breaks past its consolidation phase, but there’s growing skepticism that it could reach $300 following the news of Solana spot ETF application rejections.

A new update would put the Solana community in an emotional mangle. A few days after the positive sentiments over Grayscale’s involvement in the Solana ETF proceedings swelled, speculations suggest the product may not see the light of day soon.FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the Solana ETF approval process would not proceed further under the current administration. The notable reporter affirmed the development, citing an undisclosed source.SEC to Reject Solana ETF ApplicationsTerrett tweeted that the Securities and Exchange Commission notified at least two of the five Solana ETF applicants that the approval process would not proceed for now.

The Wall Street watchdog insisted that the current administration would not approve any new crypto ETFs.Notably, this administration, under the leadership of Gary Gensler, gave greenlight to the first crypto spot ETF in history. In January, it approved the Bitcoin spot ETF, sanctioning the second of such products—the Ethereum spot ETF—in July.What It Means for XRP ETFsMeanwhile, the recent development would affect ETF applications of other cryptocurrencies. This means the SEC will likely reject all exchange-traded products with a deadline before the new administration takes over.Although the resumption time for appointed chair Paul Atkins remains unknown, consensus expects it to be shortly after Donald Trump’s January 20 inauguration.

Recent developments, however, are addressing these barriers. Solana, known for its speed and scalability, and innovative solutions like the Plena super app are making decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible than ever. By focusing on simplifying user experiences—whether through gasless transactions or robust network performance—these initiatives are transforming blockchain from a niche technology into a practical tool for everyday users. Solana’s Anatoly Yakovenko Lauds Meme Coins for Driving Network Resilience Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently credited the rise of meme coins with stress-testing the blockchain into becoming more resilient, transforming its past outages into opportunities for engineering innovation. Speaking at the Emergence conference in Prague, Yakovenko offered insights into how the network has evolved and thrived under pressure. ”Blessed are the meme coin traders, for those who can overcome their spam will inherit the metaverse,” Yakovenko quipped during the discussion. He likened the impact of meme coins to that of NFTs, saying, ”As with NFTs...we're blessed to solve a whole bunch of engineering problems with meme coins. It just makes the network and all the systems more robust.” Yakovenko highlighted that Solana’s developers have built a reputation for tackling extraordinarily difficult challenges. This ethos, which he referred to as “chewing glass,” has been instrumental in creating a high-performance blockchain capable of withstanding the rigors of unpredictable usage. The Solana network, which suffered a series of well-publicized outages in 2022, has significantly improved its reliability. In 2023, it experienced just one outage, occurring in February, shortly after the January launch of Pump.fun, a meme coin-driven platform. The reduction in downtime marks a dramatic improvement over the network’s earlier performance, signaling that the team’s iterative approach is paying off. ”We were just lucky enough to ship fast enough to have those bugs behind us,” Yakovenko said, explaining the changes to Solana’s development strategy. The network’s evolution required addressing intricate technical challenges associated with multi-core systems. These systems, Yakovenko noted, can experience cascading issues — from memory bandwidth bottlenecks to transaction throughput delays — that compound and disrupt performance. ”These problems...I have never seen anyone predict them in research, let alone have solutions for them,” Yakovenko added. The Solana team’s ability to iterate quickly in response to real-world usage, often spurred by the chaos brought by meme coin activity, has been key to overcoming these challenges. A Single State Advantage Yakovenko argued that Solana’s architectural design—its single state execution environment—plays a critical role in its scalability and usability. Unlike layer 2 solutions, which often require additional bridges and infrastructure, Solana’s unified state allows for faster, simpler, and cheaper transactions. “Raydium did not expect that every meme coin is going to use their pools for launches,” Yakovenko said, referring to the popular decentralized exchange on Solana. “But nobody had to ask Raydium, ‘Hey, can we do this?’ [and] nobody had to go and create additional bridges. It just became easy, and that ease of use and lack of fees and friction creates a thriving ecosystem.” Yakovenko pointed out that while other blockchain networks could theoretically replicate this functionality using layer 2 solutions, the inherent complexity and developer inertia often favor Solana’s streamlined approach. “In theory, it’s possible,” Yakovenko mused. “But developers are lazy and will take the path of least resistance.” The rise of meme coins on Solana has come as both a surprise and a natural progression in hindsight. Yakovenko shared his initial reaction to the phenomenon, admitting that he hadn’t anticipated the level of popularity these tokens would achieve on the network. However, upon reflection, the trend aligns with broader patterns in digital economies. “In almost all digital economies, entertainment is the biggest place where money is made,” Yakovenko noted. “When I start to think of it backwards, it’s almost obvious in retrospect.” The Solana network’s ability to turn challenges into strengths has positioned it as a robust blockchain ecosystem. From outages to innovations, the journey has been marked by adaptability and resilience. As Solana continues to grow, its commitment to performance, ease of use, and cost-efficiency ensures it remains a major player in the blockchain space, prepared to face the next wave of challenges—and opportunities—that come its way. Plena and Solana Partner to Revolutionize DeFi Accessibility with Gasless Transactions Blockchain technology has long been touted as a tool for breaking free from centralization, but its complex user experience has kept many from fully engaging with its benefits. Complicated onboarding processes, gas fee management, fragmented ecosystems, and a lack of intuitive wallet recovery options have created significant barriers to adoption. Now, a partnership between Plena, a crypto super app, and Solana, one of the fastest-growing blockchain networks, promises to simplify these challenges and usher in a new era of user-friendly decentralized finance (DeFi). While blockchain’s potential to disrupt centralized systems is well-documented, the infrastructure has been notoriously difficult for newcomers to navigate. Managing volatile native tokens for gas fees, understanding complex wallet mechanics, and interacting with fragmented DApps have created a steep learning curve. These barriers have kept DeFi out of reach for many, despite its transformative potential. Simplifying the user experience is essential for bringing blockchain to mainstream audiences. The Plena-Solana partnership represents a critical step toward making DeFi intuitive, accessible, and widely adopted. Plena, a crypto super app with built-in account abstraction, has announced its integration with Solana. Account abstraction allows users to engage with blockchain services seamlessly by abstracting away technical complexities. This enables single-click swaps and trades, gasless transactions, and access to decentralized applications (DApps) like Jupiter — all within Plena’s unified interface. Through this partnership, Plena aims to make DeFi as effortless as using a traditional financial app. By integrating with Solana, a blockchain renowned for its speed, scalability, and affordability, the collaboration promises to eliminate common entry barriers and expand DeFi’s reach. Solana has emerged as a leading “consumer blockchain,” capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second with near-zero fees. This speed and scalability have made it the go-to network for developers creating consumer-focused applications. Its vibrant ecosystem, bolstered by the meme coin craze, has driven confidence among users and developers alike. Recently, Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes hit all-time highs, even surpassing Ethereum and layer 2 solutions. This momentum solidifies Solana’s position as a decentralized trading powerhouse, perfectly suited for partnerships like the one with Plena. One of the most groundbreaking aspects of the Plena-Solana integration is the introduction of gasless transactions. Traditionally, users need native tokens like SOL or ETH to pay for gas fees when interacting with DApps or executing trades. This requirement often confuses newcomers and deters adoption. Plena eliminates this hurdle by enabling users to perform swaps, send tokens, and trade meme coins without holding SOL for gas fees. By abstracting this layer of complexity, Plena makes DeFi more accessible, allowing users to engage without needing to juggle multiple wallets or depend on centralized exchanges. This approach not only reduces friction but also enhances privacy and user control. Solana’s liquidity is another major advantage for decentralized trading. With billions of dollars in weekly trading volume, it has become a central hub for DeFi activities. Plena aims to make this liquidity more accessible by pairing Solana’s scalable network with a user-friendly interface. Plena’s super app, already boasting over 1.3 million active users, will introduce this audience to Solana’s ecosystem, unlocking extensive DEX volumes without the technical challenges that have traditionally plagued DeFi platforms. Available on the App Store, Google Play, and Telegram, the app bridges the gap between sophisticated blockchain technology and everyday users. The Future of DeFi: Intuitive and Inclusive The integration of Plena with Solana represents a pivotal moment in blockchain’s evolution. By focusing on gasless transactions, seamless asset bridging, and a simplified user experience, the partnership sets a new standard for consumer blockchain applications. Users can now tap into Solana’s liquidity with minimal friction, making DeFi as accessible as traditional financial services. This collaboration also shows the broader trend of improving blockchain usability. By removing barriers and making DeFi intuitive, projects like Plena are paving the way for mass adoption. With Solana’s unmatched speed and scalability powering this transformation, the DeFi landscape is poised for significant growth. The partnership between Plena and Solana demonstrates how blockchain technology is evolving to meet the demands of a broader audience. By simplifying complex processes, eliminating gas fees, and leveraging Solana’s high-performance infrastructure, Plena is setting a benchmark for user-friendly DeFi solutions. As blockchain continues to mature, integrations like this signal a future where decentralized finance is not just a tool for early adopters but a cornerstone of mainstream financial systems. With over a million users already on board, Plena’s expansion into the Solana ecosystem marks a significant step toward making DeFi accessible to everyone.",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6406/solana-s-anatoly-yakovenko-says-meme-coins-strengthened-the-network,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37283001,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623670,1733477102,Arbitrum and FET See Moderate Q4 Performances As Analysts Focus On This New Altcoin,"Arbitrum (ARB) and Fetch.ai (FET) posted moderate performances in Q4 and analysts are still searching for opportunities in the altcoin sector. Among those contenders is Lunex Network , a new project attracting attention with its multichain interoperability and DeFi solutions. With over $4.4 million raised in its presale so far and a unique revenue-sharing model, Lunex Network is appealing to Fetch.ai and Arbitrum investors seeking high-growth potential assets. Arbitrum One Hits $20 Billion TVL Milestone Arbitrum One has hit $20 billion in total value locked (TVL) and is now a top Layer-2 blockchain. This milestone demonstrates the solid foundation of Arbitrum and the growing faith of investors in Layer-2 solutions. The Arbitrum Foundation is continually developing its ecosystem towards AI and tech advancements. Such growths reflect Arbitrum’s intent to remain at the forefront of blockchain advancements. As of December 5, Arbitrum’s ARB gained 17.46% to $1.18 and its market cap hit $4.84 billion. However, despite the rise, Arbitrum’s trading volume decreased by 3.01% to $1.38 billion. Nevertheless, the TVL growth shows Arbitrum One’s expanding presence in the blockchain space and its potential to rewrite decentralized finance down the road. Fetch.ai (FET) Breaks Out with 12% Surge, Eyes $2.70 Following Earn-and-Burn Announcement Fetch.ai (FET) has made waves following the launch of its “Earn-and-Burn” mechanism, which aims to reduce token supply by burning up to 100 million tokens in December. This move has sparked bullish momentum, pushing Fetch.ai out of weeks-long consolidation in a symmetrical triangle pattern. Breaking above $1.68, Fetch.ai surged to $1.94 within 24 hours, marking a solid 12% gain. The next major resistance levels lie at $2 and $2.15, with a successful break potentially paving the way to $2.70 for Fetch.ai—an impressive 71% upside. Technical indicators point to continued bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 65, indicating upward potential without being overbought. If Fetch.ai holds above its breakout zone, the rally is likely to continue. Lunex Network: Revolutionizing Crypto Trading with Seamless Interoperability and Lucrative Staking Rewards Lunex network promises explosive growth due to its unique ability to join isolated blockchains together as a Network. This allows traders to swap over 50,000 crypto pairs at the best rates. Rather than utilizing outdated security protocols, Lunex Network (LNEX) leverages the latest smart contracts technology to facilitate crypto transactions. The platform includes an advanced, user-friendly, and efficient interface for trading, staking, and liquidity all without the KYC verification procedure. Users keep complete control over their assets and all trades are conducted over the Ethereum blockchain. Importantly, Lunex Network does away with third-party wallets, giving security-conscious traders a break. Lunex Network also boasts a lucrative revenue-sharing system, with staking rewards offering up to 18% APY in as little as 30 days. Traders can increase their passive income by adding more Lunex Network tokens to their staking pool without losing their existing APY. The deflationary nature of the $LNEX token, supported by Lunex Network’s open-market buyback mechanism, further drives its value. Priced at just $0.0038 per token, Lunex Network is attracting both retail and institutional investors who have poured over $4.4M into the project so far. Analysts project a 2000% surge by the end of its presale, with potential for an additional 1,000% rally in 2025.

37292541,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104149,1733476991,Whales Deploy Over $110M to Accumulate Cardano: Is a Fresh Pump Coming?,"As Cardano continues its consolidation phase, prominent investors are leveraging this moment to load up on their holdings. Market watcher Ali Martinez drew attention to this development in a tweet, citing data from the intelligence platform Santiment. According to the disclosure, whales have accumulated more than 100 million ADA in the last few days.Notably, these are high-net-worth individuals who typically hold between 100 million to 1 billion Cardano tokens. They deployed an additional $110 million to buy ADA when the token was just above $1. As of Thursday, when the trend was observed, their cumulative holdings expanded to 3.26 billion ADA tokens.Typical Patterns of Cardano Whales During Dips and UptrendsInterestingly, the accompanying chart pointed to a consistent pattern in whales accumulation trend and the subsequent price action of ADA. It depicted that, over the last 30 days, these whales often accumulate ADA during dips and sell their holdings when the price pumps .For instance, in the second week of November, when ADA was between the $0.50 and $0.60 range, these whales deployed capital to accumulate the tokens massively. By the third week, when ADA broke out to the $0.70 and $0.80 range, they took profits, reducing their holdings significantly.Likewise, when Cardano briefly dipped after reclaiming $1, the whales leveraged the dip to buy more ADA, only to sell when it pumped again. This pattern has recurred several times during these recent periods of heightened interest in Cardano. Chart showing whale accumulation and Cardano price action Meanwhile, their overall buying has exceeded their selling, as their total holdings continue to grow, staying higher than previous levels before Cardano's breakout.Overall Uptrend in Whale Holdings of CardanoAs reported earlier , between October 18 and November 18, Cardano whales increased their holdings by 145%, reaching $12.11 billion. Investors with over $10 million in ADA saw the largest growth, while wallets holding between $100K and $1 million grew 106% to $4.36 billion.Meanwhile, those holding between $1 million and $10 million saw their holdings rise 83% to $3.9 billion. Conversely, retail investors reduced their holdings by 39%, leaving just $285,490. Those with between $10K and $100K in ADA also sold off, reducing their Cardano exposure by 7.65%.Now that Cardano is trading in the red and whales are buying, it suggests that the asset could see a continuation of the bull rally in the coming days before another correction. At press time, ADA is trading at $1.19, down by 2.64% in the last 24 hours.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/06/whales-deploy-over-110m-to-accumulate-cardano-is-a-fresh-pump-coming/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=whales-deploy-over-110m-to-accumulate-cardano-is-a-fresh-pump-coming,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37282733,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389940,1733476920,$3 Billion in Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expire Today: Volatility Ahead?,"The post $3 Billion in Bitcoin & Ethereum Options Expire Today: Volatility Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is bracing for a potentially wild day as $3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options contracts are set to expire today. These expirations are known for sparking sudden price swings, and traders are already on edge. Bitcoin has dropped nearly 5% in a single day, falling from its all-time high to $98K, while Ethereum has slipped to $3,890. But what happens next? Bitcoin Faces Big Expirations: Tension Builds Data from Deribit shows that 23,481 Bitcoin options contracts, worth about $2.29 billion, are expiring today. The put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin is 1.11, suggesting a slightly bearish sentiment. The maximum pain point, the price at which most options expire worthless, is at $97,000. Bitcoin has already seen a sharp drop, falling nearly 5% from its recent all-time high of $100,000 to $98,000. Analysts at Greeks.live have commented on this volatility, noting the crypto market’s resilience despite these setbacks. 6 Dec Options Delivery Data 23,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 1.11, a maxpain point of $97,000 and a notional value of $2.3 billion. 147,000 ETH options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.62, a maxpain of $3,500 and a notional value of $570 million. Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/APzvJ1ohe3 — Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) December 6, 2024 Bitcoin’s rise to $103,000 was impressive, but the recent drop has liquidated many leveraged positions. Despite this, the market remains strong, with solid buying activity in the spot market showing continued positive sentiment. Still, high funding rates for leveraged contracts suggest that some traders may have overextended their bullish bets, raising concerns about possible further pullbacks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Forms a Bullish Pattern: If ETH Price Smahes These Levels, a 60% Rise is Imminent Reaching $6000 , Ethereum’s Bullish Sentiment Ethereum is also facing significant expirations today, with 148,733 contracts worth around $585 million expiring . Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s put-to-call ratio is 0.55, indicating a more bullish outlook. The maximum pain point for Ethereum is at $3,500, slightly below its current price of $3,890. This lower put-to-call ratio signals that traders are more optimistic about Ethereum’s price recovery than Bitcoin’s. However, like Bitcoin, the impact of these expirations is expected to be short-term. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, these effects are often brief. Broader market trends and investor sentiment are likely to be the main drivers of price movements. FAQs Why did Bitcoin’s price drop after hitting $100K? Bitcoin fell 5% due to expiring options, high funding rates, and the liquidation of leveraged positions, triggering short-term pullbacks.

37282680,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623626,1733476565,Why is the NFT market reawakening: Pudgy Penguins floor rises to a new record,"The NFT market is reawakening and projects are trying to reinvent and rebuild their appeal. The Pudgy Penguins NFT collection broke out, reaching a new floor price record. Pudgy Penguins set the stage for a renewed NFT season. The collection reached a new all-time high for its floor price, surpassing even the peak NFT season in 2021. Other collections appreciated as well, with CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club rising to a six-month high. For the top three collections, the price rally followed a handful of high-value deals, where just under 50 top NFT sales were enough to stir up the market. In the case of Pudgy Penguins, the floor price rose after only five valuable Penguins changed hands in the past day. Pudgy Penguins floor price rallied vertically to a new all-time high. | Source: NFT Price Floor NFTs have been trying to regain traction in late 2024, aiming to recapture the hype from the meme token market. The NFTs space is waiting for the relaunch of a new OpenSea version, while MagicEden is preparing for its ME token airdrop. Other top collections also rallied to an all-time high, including the Miladies. This collection’s community has remained active in the crypto space, quickly adopting any and all new trends and spilling over into meme tokens. Pudgy Penguins prepares for token launch in December For years, Pudgy Penguins was mostly known for its original collection of 8,888 NFTs. The project also launched side collections and real-world items with on-chain certification. The recent price rally preceded the announcement of a Pudgy Penguins token, expected to arrive by the end of the year. The token will trade under the ticker $PENGU, arriving after three years of adoption for the Penguins collection. Introducing $PENGU , the official coin of Pudgy Penguins. Launching in 2024. Learn more below. pic.twitter.com/J715bODcM6 — Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) December 6, 2024 Luca Netz , the CEO of Pudgy Penguins, announced a virtual meeting on December 7, with more potential information for the token launch. The token will try to reach multiple communities, in addition to current users. Pudgy Penguins is still connecting real-world shopping behaviors with crypto culture, and PENGU will also be used to that end. The token launch arrives shortly after Pudgy Penguins received a funding round from Animoca Brands . The PENGU token will launch on Solana, gaining access to some of the most active meme communities and wallet users. The token will run with a total supply of 88,888,888,888. The team will receive 17.8% of that supply, with a one-year cliff unlock and three years of vesting. More than 25% will be reserved for the community, with 24% reserved for other communities and incentives. The remaining PENGU will go toward the company reserves and for liquidity purposes. A small allocation will go to any remaining FTT token holders. Alameda Research and the FTX market operators were among Pudgy Penguin holders, though they have since moved on, leaving the project to the community. The token announcement has activated scam attempts around the token allocation. For now, there has been no token generation event (TGE), and the official Pudgy Penguins is yet to announce the mechanism of airdropping the tokens. The token launch is inviting scammers with fake links and Telegram bots, which may lead to NFT or asset losses. Can NFT make a comeback? Top collections retain high floor prices, but the mass rush to NFT is not there yet. The two events that may revive the sector are the MagicEden airdrop and the relaunch of OpenSea . MagicEden ME airdrops are often touted as having a value of a few hundred dollars. However, some users are reporting zero allocation, despite holding valuable NFTs and having a trading history. OpenSea announced it expects a relaunch in December, while also sparking expectations for an airdrop. Recently, the market operator sent out a message to its community, asking how long users relied on its platform for NFT swaps. It may be precisely the airdrop hopes that are boosting some collection holders. A retroactive snapshot from 2021 or 2022 activity levels would make many early NFT adopters return to the market. NFT-based tokens may become a new asset class, though arriving rather late in the game, as most altcoins already had their strongest rallies for the year.

37283492,https://thecoinrise.com/lawrence-summers-slams-trumps-bitcoin-reserve-proposal-as-politically-driven/,1733476542,Lawrence Summers Slams Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Proposal as Politically Driven,"Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has dismissed President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal for a national Bitcoin reserve, calling it an impractical and politically motivated idea. Speaking to Bloomberg TV on December 6, Summers argued the idea served more to please campaign donors than to benefit the nation. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary likened the proposal to historical strategies like accumulating gold reserves at Fort Knox or maintaining a national oil reserve but argued Bitcoin lacks the same strategic purpose. “Why would the government support a sterile inventory of Bitcoin? It’s purely about pandering to special interests,” Summers added. A Divided Debate on Bitcoin’s Role in Debt Management The remarks follow Trump’s campaign suggestion to retain the 198,000 BTC seized by the U.S. government—an amount valued at over $19 billion. Trump-aligned lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis, have even proposed legislation to have the U.S. acquire 1 million BTC, representing approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply, as a long-term asset. Lummis’ push for a Bitcoin reserve is rooted in the idea of leveraging it to reduce the nation’s $36 trillion debt . However, critics argue that this approach is overly optimistic. Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, recently noted during a crypto summit that while a Bitcoin reserve might be beneficial, it is no substitute for structural fiscal reforms. “You still have to actually do the budgetary reforms to get us out of this $2 trillion a year of federal deficits,” Roy said. Balancing Innovation and Practicality While Summers dismissed the Bitcoin reserve idea, he acknowledged that not all of Trump’s crypto rhetoric is without merit. “I think we need to support financial innovation wherever it may go,” he remarked, suggesting that overzealous regulatory measures could be hindering the crypto industry’s growth. Summers’ stance reflects a broader skepticism within traditional finance circles about Bitcoin’s utility as a reserve asset . Despite his criticism, Summers, who once advised crypto giant Digital Currency Group, emphasized the importance of fostering innovation in financial technology.

Here’s What Experts Are Saying appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP’s price dropped sharply from $2.59 to $2.31 within 24 hours, bringing its market cap down by 12% to $131.42 billion. This decline pushed XRP out of its spot as the third-largest cryptocurrency, falling behind Tether (USDT). Futures trading volume also plummeted from $32 billion to $16 billion, signaling reduced market activity. The decline is largely tied to increased selling pressure and market speculation, potentially influenced by the delay in Ripple’s RLUSD token launch. With this fluctuation, the community is in doubt that RLUSD may impact XRP which is initially planned to operate on Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL). But analysts refuse such claims here’s what it means for you! RLUSD and XRP: A Partnership, Not a Rivalry Vincent Van Code, a key community voice, cleared up confusion about Ripple’s RLUSD token, emphasizing it won’t replace XRP but instead enhances the XRP Ledger (XRPL). XRP remains at the core of XRPL, streamlining cross-border transactions and solving inefficiencies in traditional forex systems by directly pairing various currencies with XRP like AUD/XRP or USD/XRP, saving costs and improving efficiency. A standout feature of XRPL is its auto-bridging capability, which simplifies currency conversions. For instance, sending RLUSD to someone in RLYEN is seamless, thanks to XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) pools. These pools stabilize prices and ensure smooth operations, even during market volatility. XRP continues to power the system as its indispensable backbone. Ripple’s Strategy Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, highlights that XRP is vital to the XRPL because it is decentralized and doesn’t rely on a middleman. While RLUSD adds new features to the system, it works alongside XRP rather than replacing it. Experts believe RLUSD’s launch might help increase XRP’s value over time, with predictions ranging from small gains to a potential high of $10 in a year. According to Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse RLUSD will largely target the big institutional players. He even added that, once RLUSD is available, it will use both RLUSD and XRP in its cross-border payments solution making the experience more enhanced for the users. Though it is still not clear if RLUSD is a threat to XRP or not, XRP’s sudden rise towards the end of the year made it clear that XRP has all the possibility to rise, and RLUSD launch can only be a bonus to this bullish momentum.",NEUTRAL,USDT | XRP,MARKET | MINING | TRADING | USDT | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-is-rlusd-a-threat-to-xrp-heres-what-experts-are-saying/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37282306,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373679,1733476173,Why is the Ripple (XRP) Price Down Today?,"XRP has managed to become the 4th largest cryptocurrency by means of total market capitalization, surpassing the likes of SOL and BNB. At one point, it even managed to outpace USDT and claim the third spot. It’s up by more than 45% in the past seven days, clearly being the best-performing altcoin from the top 10. However, over the past few days, things have changed a bit, and XRP is now in a state of correction, down 5.3% in the past day alone. Source: TradingView As you can see in the chart above, XRP topped at around $2.9 the other day, and it has been declining since then, losing about 20% in the process. Interestingly enough, this happened when Donald Trump selected Paul Atkins as the new chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In Trump’s own words: “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.” So, if the next SEC Chair is relatively pro-crypto, why is the XRP price going down ? Well, it’s important to look at things from perspective and understand that the cryptocurrency increased by almost 400% in less than 30 days at one point (before the recent correction). Nothing ever goes up in a straight line, and corrections are due. Another reason besides the market getting overheated could be the precise fact that Trump announced his candidate for the SEC Chairman. Many traders may have bought up the cryptocurrency in anticipation of his choice, essentially turning the event into a “sell-the-news.” On top of everything else, there’s also the fact that the entire market is seemingly going through a correction over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, for once, dropped to as low as $92,000 in a flash crash before recovering to where it’s currently trading.

These documents , which reveal important details about U.S. military actions, civilian deaths, and interrogation techniques, will be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, making them impossible to erase or hide. Why It Matters The Afghan War Logs were a huge deal when they were released in 2010. They showed the truth about the war in Afghanistan, including things the public didn’t know. To make sure this information can never be lost or hidden, Assange’s team is putting them on Bitcoin’s blockchain, where they’ll stay forever. Even if WikiLeaks’ website gets shut down, these documents will always be available. How It Works Project Spartacus will use Bitcoin’s blockchain to store these 76,911 files. They’ll be turned into small pieces of Bitcoin called satoshis, using a tool called Ordinals. This process will start on December 12, 2024, and will take some time because there are so many documents. Once they’re on the blockchain, they can’t be changed or erased. Interestingly, this project is more than just storing documents—it’s also about remembering Julian Assange’s role in the fight for free speech. Assange’s team isn’t trying to raise money from this project; instead, they want to honor his legacy by putting these important files on Bitcoin, a decentralized system that can’t be controlled or stopped by any government. Bitcoin’s Power to Protect Information What makes this project so special is Bitcoin’s ability to protect information from censorship. Julian Assange’s story is tightly connected to Bitcoin’s early days and its mission of resisting censorship. When traditional banks blocked WikiLeaks from receiving funds, Bitcoin became a lifeline, raising over $30 million to help with Assange’s legal battles. This showed the world how Bitcoin could stand strong where traditional systems failed. Even Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, noticed this and worried about the sudden spotlight on the new currency back in 2010. Assange proved how Bitcoin could support free speech by keeping WikiLeaks running despite global financial roadblocks, making it a real-world example of Bitcoin’s power to fight censorship. With Project Spartacus, WikiLeaks is not just preserving history—it’s making sure it’s never erased.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/wikileaks-uses-bitcoin-to-preserve-76911-afghan-war-logs/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37282630,182054,1733475900,Zircuit Welcomes Ocelex: The Newest MetaDEX Driving DeFi Growth on Zircuit,"Zurich, Switzerland, December 6th, 2024, Chainwire Ocelex is positioned to launch as a MetaDEX and liquidity layer on Zircuit , a zkEVM-based Layer 2 ecosystem designed for scalability and security. With its focus on capital-efficient innovation , community-driven participation , and 100% revenue sharing among token holders , Ocelex aims to create a transparent and inclusive DeFi environment. Zircuit’s infrastructure, which includes AI-driven sequencer security, provides a strong foundation for decentralized applications. Recent developments, such as the token generation event (TGE) of the $ZRC token, have increased attention on the ecosystem. Ocelex’s launch will leverage this momentum to establish itself as Zircuit’s primary decentralized exchange, prioritizing liquidity, accessibility, and growth within the DeFi sector. Ocelex as the First Lynex Expansion As the first franchise expansion of Lynex—the leading liquidity protocol on Linea—Ocelex builds on a proven foundation. Lynex has achieved over $3.5 billion in trading volume and distributed $7.5 million in revenue to token holders, positioning it as one of the top-performing ve(3,3) DEXs. Ocelex continues this legacy by introducing Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) aggregation , a feature designed to simplify liquidity management through automated strategies. This approach reduces risks like impermanent loss while ensuring consistent yield for liquidity providers (LPs). Strategic Partnerships and Pre-Launch Momentum Even before its official launch, Ocelex has established key partnerships and secured significant Total Value Locked (TVL). These partnerships include: EtherFi, Kelp, and Renzo for LRTs (liquidity restaking tokens). Lido and StakeStone for LSTs (liquid staking tokens). StakeStone and Elara , two leading money market protocols to ensure seamless, integrated liquidity flows for users. Ocelex’s strong pre-launch performance underscores its potential to play a key role in Zircuit’s ecosystem growth. With a current TVL of $4.6M and total trading volume of $13.3M, Ocelex has already secured a solid foothold in the DEX category. A Community-First Approach Ocelex follows Lynex’s community-centric strategy with an airdrop that prioritizes long-term alignment. 45% of Ocelex’s initial supply will be airdropped to Lynex veLYNX holders who have locked tokens for one year or more. This approach rewards loyal participants while fostering ecosystem stability. Locking veLYNX has historically provided some of the most consistent yields among ve(3,3) protocols, a trend Ocelex aims to replicate. The Upcoming Public Sale The Ocelex public sale begins on December 9th at 10:00 UTC and will run for 60 hours in a Dutch auction format . The auction ensures fair market pricing, starting at $0.30 and decreasing to $0.06. Key Sale Details: Tokens for Sale: 2,000,000 $OCX (2% of initial supply). Minimum Price: $0.06 | Starting Price: $0.30. Following the sale, the Token Generation Event (TGE) will commence, marking the start of liquidity mining and distributing tokens to pre-miners and airdrop recipients. For a comprehensive overview of the public sale, refer to this article or watch the accompanying short video . Ocelex Public Sale Projections Ocelex’s Dutch auction public sale lets the market decide its valuation and launch price, starting at $0.30 and decreasing linearly to $0.06. Community airdrop recipients, who will receive 50% of the initial supply as governance tokens, also stand to benefit from higher sale prices. With interest in Ocelex as the next big ve(3,3) DEX on Zircuit, the auction is expected to be highly competitive, following in the footsteps of Lynex, Aerodrome, and Thena. Ocelex’s Growth Potential Ocelex has the potential to secure substantial TVL on Zircuit, a network with over $2.5B in total value locked (TVL). This potential is modeled on the success of other ve(3,3) protocols: Aerodrome: Secured 41.56% of Base’s $3.85B TVL ($1.6B), with an FDV of $2.5B. Ocelex could achieve $1.039B TVL with a similar share. Lynex: Commands 4.7% of Linea’s $494M TVL ($23.2M) with an FDV of $29M. Ocelex could secure $117.5M TVL with comparable performance. Thena: Captures 1.47% of BNB Chain’s $5.8B TVL ($85M) with an FDV of $565M. Ocelex could achieve $36.75M TVL with this share. Ocelex Key Metrics: Dominant Case: $1.039B TVL (41.56%). Moderate Case: $117.5M TVL (4.7%). Conservative Case: $36.75M TVL (1.47%). With an FDV range of $6M to $30M , Ocelex presents an undervalued opportunity for early participants, particularly when compared to Aerodrome’s $2.5B FDV or Thena’s $565M. The Future of DeFi with Ocelex and Zircuit Ocelex combines Lynex’s successful model with Zircuit’s technical infrastructure, aiming to serve as a cornerstone for DeFi activity. With strong pre-launch momentum, strategic partnerships, and a focus on community alignment, Ocelex is positioned to deliver value and scalability for users and the broader DeFi ecosystem. About Ocelex Ocelex is the first expansion of the Lynex brand, launching as a franchise on Zircuit, an emerging Layer 2. Ocelex democratizes sophisticated liquidity strategies, seamlessly connecting everyday traders with expert-level capabilities. It features a competitive ecosystem of Automated Liquidity Managers (ALMs) and strategists, all striving to optimize returns, minimize risks like impermanent loss, and boost overall efficiency for every user.

StakeStone and Elara , two leading money market protocols to ensure seamless, integrated liquidity flows for users. Ocelex’s strong pre-launch performance underscores its potential to play a key role in Zircuit’s ecosystem growth. With a current TVL of $4.6M and total trading volume of $13.3M, Ocelex has already secured a solid foothold in the DEX category. A Community-First Approach Ocelex follows Lynex’s community-centric strategy with an airdrop that prioritizes long-term alignment. 45% of Ocelex’s initial supply will be airdropped to Lynex veLYNX holders who have locked tokens for one year or more. This approach rewards loyal participants while fostering ecosystem stability. Locking veLYNX has historically provided some of the most consistent yields among ve(3,3) protocols, a trend Ocelex aims to replicate. The Upcoming Public Sale The Ocelex public sale begins on December 9th at 10:00 UTC and will run for 60 hours in a Dutch auction format . The auction ensures fair market pricing, starting at $0.30 and decreasing to $0.06. Key Sale Details: Tokens for Sale: 2,000,000 $OCX (2% of initial supply). Minimum Price: $0.06 | Starting Price: $0.30. Following the sale, the Token Generation Event (TGE) will commence, marking the start of liquidity mining and distributing tokens to pre-miners and airdrop recipients. For a comprehensive overview of the public sale, refer to this article or watch the accompanying short video . Ocelex Public Sale Projections Ocelex’s Dutch auction public sale lets the market decide its valuation and launch price, starting at $0.30 and decreasing linearly to $0.06. Community airdrop recipients, who will receive 50% of the initial supply as governance tokens, also stand to benefit from higher sale prices. With interest in Ocelex as the next big ve(3,3) DEX on Zircuit, the auction is expected to be highly competitive, following in the footsteps of Lynex, Aerodrome, and Thena. Ocelex’s Growth Potential Ocelex has the potential to secure substantial TVL on Zircuit, a network with over $2.5B in total value locked (TVL). This potential is modeled on the success of other ve(3,3) protocols: Aerodrome: Secured 41.56% of Base’s $3.85B TVL ($1.6B), with an FDV of $2.5B. Ocelex could achieve $1.039B TVL with a similar share. Lynex: Commands 4.7% of Linea’s $494M TVL ($23.2M) with an FDV of $29M. Ocelex could secure $117.5M TVL with comparable performance. Thena: Captures 1.47% of BNB Chain’s $5.8B TVL ($85M) with an FDV of $565M. Ocelex could achieve $36.75M TVL with this share. Ocelex Key Metrics: Dominant Case: $1.039B TVL (41.56%). Moderate Case: $117.5M TVL (4.7%). Conservative Case: $36.75M TVL (1.47%). With an FDV range of $6M to $30M , Ocelex presents an undervalued opportunity for early participants, particularly when compared to Aerodrome’s $2.5B FDV or Thena’s $565M.

The altcoin surged 35% over the past day, hitting a seven-month high of $2.45 on Nov. 6, bringing its market cap to over $1.67 billion. The recent rally positioned DYDX as the leading gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, ranking 94th according to data from CoinGecko at press time. dydx ( DYDX ) ‘s price surge also extended its fortnightly gains to over 83% while boosting its monthly gains to more than 125%. Daily trading volume for the token jumped 113.9% over the previous day to over $369 million. Why did DYDX price soar today? DYDX’s recent rally was primarily driven by reports that President-elect Donald Trump appointed David O. Sacks as the White House Director of Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency. The news gained traction as Sacks’ venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, has made a significant investment in DYDX. This connection between the newly appointed crypto czar and the token fueled strong bullish sentiment among its investors, propelling DYDX to recent gains.

37282065,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390001,1733475694,Crypto Market Turmoil in 2025? Gray Swan Events to Prepare For,"The post Crypto Market Turmoil in 2025? Gray Swan Events to Prepare For appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News If you are into crypto, you would be well experienced with its unpredictability. It is full of surprises. One day, prices soar and the next they might fall. According to Gareth Nicholson , Chief Investment Officer at Nomura, 2025 might bring some huge turmoil events to the global financial markets. He had made a 100 pages report for the next year that also contains some “Gray Swan Events”. Let’s understand what these events are and how they can affect the crypto market in the upcoming year. Nomura's list of 6 potential gray swan events is pretty sobering tbh: 1. Nvidia crash 2. Carry implosion 3. US 10YY > 6% 4. US growth shock 5. Geopolitics gets out of hand 6. China stimulus falls short pic.twitter.com/YmNcht8c3p — David Ingles (@DavidInglesTV) December 6, 2024 What These Gray Swans Mean for Crypto Gray Swan Events are such events which have very low or almost no chance of happening but if they happen, leaves huge impacts. Nicholas has mentioned the below mentioned events in his report in Nomura’s 2025 Outlook. 1. NVIDIA Crash: Trouble for Crypto Mining NVIDIA is more than just a tech giant—it’s at the core of crypto mining. If its value drops sharply, miners might struggle to get the hardware they need. This could slow down blockchain networks and leave smaller cryptocurrencies exposed to attacks. If miners can’t access affordable tech, it could also lower confidence in the entire crypto ecosystem. A crash like this could lead to panic selling, and as a result, Bitcoin and altcoins may tumble. 2. Carry Trade Unwind: Liquidity Fades If this happens people will not have funds to invest more in crypto and they can even withdraw their crypto portfolios. Even big investors, in order to secure their money, might pull out their funds from the crypto market, triggering panic sales and plummeting. Still, some investors may see Bitcoin as a safer bet during tough times, viewing it as a hedge against traditional markets. But it’s a gamble either way. 3. Rising Treasury Yields: Pressure on Bitcoin If US Treasury yields go above 6%, it might make more sense for investors to park their money in safer, steady options. For crypto, this could reduce its appeal. People might move away from high-risk assets like Bitcoin and opt for more stable returns. However, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation could grow in this scenario. Higher Treasury yields might weaken the dollar, and Bitcoin could be seen as a better alternative. In the end, how people view Bitcoin—either as “digital gold” or just a speculative investment—will determine its fate. 4. US Growth Shock: What Happens If the Economy Slows Down? If the US economy unexpectedly slows down in 2025, it could cause big problems for markets worldwide. A shock like this would reduce the amount of money available for investment, making it harder for people to access funds and causing markets to drop. The crypto market, already seen as high-risk, might take an even bigger hit as investors pull back from risky assets. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could see their prices fall as the global financial environment tightens. 5. Geopolitical Tensions: Can Bitcoin Handle It? When political conflicts happen, markets usually take a hit. Investors often turn to safer assets like gold, which can cause crypto to struggle. The world has witnessed this multiple times like during the conflicts in the Middle East. However, Bitcoin might stand out in these tough times. Since it’s decentralized, people in areas with financial restrictions could see it as a way to keep their money safe. While political tensions may cause short-term drops in the crypto market, Bitcoin could gain more support in the long run as people look for alternatives to traditional finance. 6. China stimulus falls short If China’s economic stimulus plan doesn’t live up to expectations, it could cause a slowdown in demand for Bitcoin. Investors might lose confidence in China’s ability to boost its economy, which could spill over into global markets, including crypto. Instead of pushing Bitcoin’s price higher, this scenario could result in lower investor sentiment and increased volatility, as markets react to the disappointment. Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now part of the larger financial ecosystem. Events like an NVIDIA crash or rising Treasury yields could bring both challenges and new opportunities. The key to navigating 2025 will be staying informed, flexible, and prepared for the unexpected Gray Swan Events. Crypto’s future will depend on how well it adapts to these changes. By preparing yourself, you can make the most of whatever happens in the coming year.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-2025-gray-swan-events-could-shape-crypto-markets/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Howells accidentally discarded the hard drive during an office cleanup in 2013, and since then, his requests to search the landfill have been consistently rejected by Newport City Council. The council argues that discarded items in the landfill become their property and cannot be sold or retrieved. Howells has offered the council 25% of the recovered funds to gain permission for the search , but the council remains firm, citing legal and logistical challenges. Howells has assembled a team of data recovery and excavation experts who have pinpointed the likely location of the hard drive. Their plan involves a targeted excavation designed to minimize environmental impact. During a hearing at a Welsh court on December 2, his legal team argued that the project is being managed on a contingency basis, with the experts only receiving payment if the Bitcoin is recovered. The council's legal team dismissed the proposal, calling it an attempt to purchase something they claim cannot legally be sold. The hard drive, buried in the landfill for over a decade, represents one of the biggest losses in Bitcoin history. Social media users have compared Howells' misfortune to other famous cryptocurrency mishaps, such as the man who spent 10,000 Bitcoin on two pizzas in 2010, which would be worth billions today. Despite the obstacles, Howells continues to fight for permission to search the landfill. If his plans are approved, the recovery process would still be extremely challenging, likened to searching for a needle in a haystack. If denied, Howells’ story will remain a cautionary tale about the risks of handling digital assets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/man-fights-to-recover-800m-bitcoin-lost-in-landfill,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37282083.jpeg

37282011,https://crypto.news/?p=14316761,1733475612,WikiLeaks’ Afghan war logs to be immortalized on the Bitcoin blockchain on Dec. 12,"WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange and supporters plan to mint 76,911 Afghan war log files into Bitcoin inscriptions on the Ordinals through Project Spartacus. The collection of documents spanning six years of recounts from the Afghan war titled “Afghan War Diary 2004-2010” is currently available on the WikiLeaks site . The documents released in July 2010, consists of over 91,000 reports covering the war, including confidential content in US military operations, including civilian casualties and interrogation methods. Although they are publicly available, the sensitive nature of the content means that there is always a risk of losing access to these files. This is why Assange and his friends and relatives plan to preserve them forever through Project Spartacus. Project Spartacus is an initiative that aims to inscribe the Afghan War logs onto the Bitcoin ( BTC ) blockchain using a tool called OrdinalsBot . According to the Block , the movement is supported by Assange Campaign chairman Gabriel Shipton, who emphasized the importance of making the Afghan War Diary accessible for generations to come. The free mint will be available on ProjectSpartacus.org starting from Dec. 12 this year. Afterwards, OrdinalsBot will relaunch the effort, allowing users to participate in minting the Afghan War Diary on the firm’s marketplace, Trio. You might also like: Why did Binance ditch Ordinals — and will the market survive? OrdinalsBot founder Toby Lewis predicted that the minting process for more than 70,000 Afghan War log files could take a very long time to complete because it is not “a 10K collection” and will possibly span a series of different blocks. Lewis also clarified that the initiative is not tied to the efforts of raising funds for Assange, who is seeking a full pardon from President Joe Biden. He claimed that the only people who are going to get paid through the mint are the miners. In June 2024, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was released from prison after pleading guilty to a single charge of conspiring and disclosing classified information. Aside from leaking the Afghan war logs, Assange’s organization also published documents that exposed how Russia used state surveillance to spy on citizen’s Internet and cellphone usage in 2017. WikiLeaks history also has ties to Bitcoin. Assange once sought to raise funds for his project through Bitcoin after several major financial firms denied payments to WikiLeaks. However, Bitcoin creator Satosi Nakamoto was against WikiLeaks using Bitcoin for payment in 2010. At the time, Nakamoto was concerned that association with WikiLeaks could overwhelm Bitcoin in its early stages of development.

37282633,https://invezz.com/?p=2371399,1733475600,Cardano targets $1.4 after breakout; iDEGEN nets $2.5M as Phantom Wallet integrates Sui,"As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes above $100k, three altcoins, Cardano (ADA), Sui (SUI), and iDEGEN, are making waves with significant developments. Cardano is on the verge of breaching key resistance levels after a strong breakout. Sui reaches new milestones with Phantom Wallet integration, while iDEGEN’s innovative presale model garners attention. Cardano breaking out toward $1.4 and beyond Cardano (ADA) has recently captured market attention by breaking out of a prolonged consolidation phase, currently trading at $1.22. The token is targeting a critical resistance level of $1.40, which could pave the way for a rally to $3.00 if surpassed. Technical indicators like the Stochastic RSI at 100 signal robust bullish momentum, albeit with caution due to overbought conditions that might lead to a short-term correction. On-chain metrics further solidify Cardano’s bullish outlook. Over the past week, the network has seen a 53.95% increase in new addresses and a 42.13% rise in active addresses, signaling growing user adoption. Zero-balance addresses have surged by 54.28%, reflecting an influx of new participants into the ecosystem. Despite a slightly bearish long/short ratio of 0.92, the possibility of a short squeeze remains as bullish sentiment grows. Cardano’s ecosystem development continues to impress, with the Hydra protocol recently achieving over one million transactions per second (TPS). Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, envisions an even greater impact. At the Cardano Constitutional Convention in Nairobi , he emphasized the blockchain’s potential as a foundational global infrastructure. He highlighted its ability to streamline governance and foster collaboration across blockchain networks, positioning Cardano as a transformative force in global systems. Sui’s momentum builds with Phantom Wallet integration Sui (SUI) has maintained its upward trajectory since August, recently achieving an all-time high of $4.40. The blockchain’s total value locked (TVL) has soared to $1.72 billion, making it the eighth-largest network by TVL and surpassing notable blockchains like Avalanche and Polygon. One of Sui’s most significant developments is its integration with Phantom Wallet , marking the wallet’s first expansion beyond Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Phantom Wallet’s user-friendly interface and robust features, combined with Sui’s scalability and Move programming language, create a powerful synergy. This integration is expected to drive further adoption and enhance Sui’s ecosystem. On the technical front, SUI’s trading range between $3.1 and $3.94, with $3.52 as a critical midpoint, indicates a bullish market structure. Key support levels at $3.2 and $3.5 provide entry points for traders eyeing the next upward move. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 60 and steady growth in On-Balance Volume (OBV) underscore strong buying interest, despite minor consolidation. Strategic partnership with Franklin Templeton as well as innovations like BTC staking through liquid tokens , further strengthen Sui’s position. The blockchain’s resilience during recent technical challenges, including a brief halt in block production, has instilled confidence among investors and reinforced its upward trajectory. iDEGEN revolutionizing meme tokens with AI and dynamic pricing iDEGEN, a new AI-powered meme token, is making waves with its innovative approach to community engagement and presale dynamics. Launched on November 26, 2024, iDEGEN’s presale has already raised over $2.5 million, with 434 million tokens sold. The presale is set to conclude on January 1, 2025, offering investors a unique opportunity to get involved before the token hits major exchanges. What sets iDEGEN apart is its dynamic pricing model. The token price adjusts every five minutes based on market activity. Consecutive purchases increase the price by 5%, while inactivity triggers a 5% price decrease. This mechanism creates a fast-paced, engaging environment that appeals to traders and enthusiasts seeking volatility. iDEGEN’s use of artificial intelligence (AI) further distinguishes it from traditional meme coins. The AI adapts and evolves based on community feedback, analyzing interactions on X . This allows the community to shape the project’s trajectory, fostering a deeper connection between the developers and their audience. The token’s presale success and expected listing price, projected to be 10% higher than the final presale price, underscore its growing popularity. As iDEGEN combines AI-driven innovation with the excitement of meme culture, it could emerge as a standout project in the cryptocurrency space.

The market of non-fungible tokens seems to be showing signs of recovery, with an over 20% surge in trading volume in November, per a report by DappRadar. According to the data, NFT trading volume reached $698 million, marking a 22% increase from October. NFT trading volume and sales count in 2024 | Source: DappRadar DappRadar’s analyst Sara Gherghelas attributes the growth to “increased engagement with blue-chip collections” like those from Yuga Labs and rising token prices, alongside increased liquidity and confidence among investors. “Improved liquidity and increased engagement with blue-chip collections are fostering confidence among collectors and investors, who are now viewing NFTs not only as speculative assets but also as cultural commodities.” Sara Gherghelas Despite the growth in trading volume, sales volume declined by 11% to 3 million units, which might be signaling a shift toward more valuable transactions.

As reported by NFTevening, November also saw a rise in the overall NFT market value, which grew to $8.8 billion. At the same time, daily trading volume across all chains rose by almost 50%. The data shows that blue-chip NFT collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club were crucial to the market’s rebound. While CryptoPunks saw a 392% increase in trading volume, BAYC saw strong demand, with its floor price rising 75.79% week-on-week to $79,727.

This collaboration aims to bring the digital currency to over 200 million people, with a special focus on unbanked and underbanked populations. The initiative comes after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tested the digital rupee on Ripple’s XRP ledger in November, confirming its security and scalability for widespread use. The digital rupee, India’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), was launched more than two years ago but has struggled to gain significant traction. To address this, the partnership is targeting key sectors like agriculture, education, and travel. A primary goal is to offer closed-loop wallet solutions, providing a cost-effective platform for domestic and cross-border payments. AFC India will assist DC Wallet in integrating its services with both public and private sector banks, expanding financial access in underserved communities. The RBI’s recent test of the digital rupee on Ripple’s blockchain network was a milestone. It demonstrated the technology’s ability to handle large-scale institutional transactions securely and efficiently. However, the bigger challenge remains—encouraging everyday users to adopt the currency. This public-private partnership aims to bridge this gap by offering practical applications and seamless financial tools. The push for digital rupee adoption reflects broader global trends. Similar initiatives are being observed in countries like Brazil , where central banks have partnered with crypto firms to roll out digital currencies. In India, the government is keen on promoting the digital rupee as a safer alternative to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which financial regulators have criticized. Recently, Indian authorities have taken a strict stance against non-compliant crypto firms, underlining their preference for regulated digital currencies. DC Wallet’s collaboration with AFC India is not just a business venture but also a step towards financial inclusion. With over 200 million potential users in its sights, the partnership hopes to transform how people interact with money, especially in rural and underserved areas. Its success could set a benchmark for digital currency adoption worldwide. However, achieving this ambitious goal will require overcoming significant challenges, particularly in building trust and familiarity among users new to digital currencies.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/dc-wallet-teams-up-with-india-to-boost-digital-rupee,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37281968.jpeg

Jasmy, often named the Japan’s Bitcoin, soared to a high of $0.0590, its highest swing since January 2022. It has jumped by over 963% from its lowest point this year. Why did JasmyCoin price surge? Jasmy, a popular Japanese cryptocurrency, has been one of the best-performing coins in the past few weeks. It has jumped by over 200% in the past 30 days, bringing its market cap to over $2 billion for the first time ever. JasmyCoin’s rally happened because of the strong rally made by Bitcoin this week. It crossed the important resistance level at $100,000 for the first time on Thursday. It then accelerated the uptrend, reaching an all-time high of near $104,000. Bitcoin’s rally triggered interest in other related coins. For example, Ravencoin jumped to a high of $0.0358, its highest level since April this year. Similarly, Litecoin, a popular Bitcoin hard fork, jumped to $147, higher than the year-to-date low of $50. Jasmy price has also jumped as the number of its holders has uncreased in the past few weeks. It now has almost 80,000 holders, much higher than the 76.3k it had a month ago. An increase in the number of holders is a sign that the coin is gaining more traction. Most of Jasmy’s holders are in Binance, followed by Bybit and MEXC. JasmyCoin also soared after the developers teamed up with IoTeX, a move that is intended to bring Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) to Japan.

The altcoin season index has moved to 85, meaning that most coins are doing better than Bitcoin. The crypto fear and greed index has moved to the extreme greed zone. Jasmy price forecast JASMY chart by TradingView The daily chart shows that the JASMY price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months. It recently moved above the key resistance level at $0.04466, its highest level in June this year. Jasmy has moved above the upper side of the cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish continuation pattern. A C&H pattern is a situation where an asset forms its first peak, then drops gradually, and then starts rising gradually. Jasmy has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) crossed each other. It has also moved to the top of the trading range of the Murrey Math Lines tool. This means that it has more upside to go to get to the extreme overshoot of $0.085, which is about 67% above the current level. The depth of the C&H’s cup is about 72%, which means that the coin may jump to about $0.1 if the bullish trend continues. The stop-loss of this trade is at the strong, pivot, reverse point at $0.0366. A drop below that level will point to more downside, potentially to the oversold level at $0.01831 The post Jasmy price prediction: 2 reasons why ‘Japan’s Bitcoin’ surged appeared first on Invezz",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,Invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/06/jasmy-price-prediction-2-reasons-why-japans-bitcoin-surged/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png
37281827,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623620,1733474896,Former US Treasury Secretary calls the national Bitcoin reserve ‘crazy’,"Former United States Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers described President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal for a strategic Bitcoin reserve as “crazy,” suggesting it serves primarily to appease his crypto campaign contributors. National reserves, historically including gold, foreign currencies, and commodities such as oil, serve as a nation’s financial safety net. The United States has already seized more than 200,000 Bitcoin (BTC) during criminal investigations. However, certain legislators, such as Senator Cynthia Lummis, are interested in expanding the scope. States such as Pennsylvania are currently planning Bitcoin investments, which could potentially establish a precedent for federal action. Bitcoin as a national reserve is ‘crazy’ – Lawrence Summer’s take Lawrence Summers is an American economist. He was the 71st Secretary of the Treasury of the United States from 1999 to 2001. On an interview on TV he said, “I understand why we need a national oil reserve; I understand why a century ago we accumulated gold in Fort Knox,” he added. “Of all the prices to support, why would the government choose to support, by accumulating a sterile inventory, a bunch of Bitcoin? Lawrence Summers dismissed the idea of the government setting up a reserve of Bitcoin assets. He said, “There’s no reason to do that other than to pander to generous special-interest campaign contributors.” According to Arkham Intelligence, the Bitcoin that the US has seized is worth$19 billion. Trump has been advised by Lummis’ Bitcoin Act that the United States should consider acquiring up to 1 million BTC over a five-year period, with the funds being derived from the reallocation of existing federal assets so that it can be a national reserve. Although Lawrence Summer rejected the idea, he agreed with many pro-crypto leaders that crypto has been over-regulated. Other criticisms of Bitcoin as a National Reserve. The primary objective of the BTC Reserve initiative is to eliminate the nation’s national debt, which exceeds $36 trillion. Avik Roy, president of the think tank the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, said at a crypto summit last month that it is “an overselling of what Bitcoin could do.” He added, “The Bitcoin reserve is good, but it does not solve the problem You still have to actually do the budgetary reforms to get us out of this $2 trillion a year of federal deficits.” Carlos Salinas, a professor of Blockchain and Digital Asset Investment at the IEB, is skeptical that the United States can accumulate such a substantial amount of BTC, although he does not wholly dismiss the possibility. He, however, cautioned, “We observed FOMO at the previous highs of bitcoin in 2021; however, we are currently experiencing institutional FOMO during this bullish phase.” We are unaware of the potential extent of this. BTC’S volatility is another downside of becoming a national reserve. As a decentralized asset , there are also potential consequences of government control. However, experts anticipate that the establishment of a US BTC reserve could result in an unprecedented increase in BTC’s price, with some estimates suggesting that it could reach as high as $500,000 or $1 million per coin. Nations that are considering crypto reserve El Salvador has been a pioneer in establishing a strategic crypto reserve. Actually, the Central American country became the first to recognize BTC as legal cash in September 2021. According to reports the country bought up to 5,944 Bitcoins worth more than $560 million at current market prices. In addition, the kingdom of Bhutan holds 12,218 Bitcoins worth $1.2 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence. The crypto state’s income stems from Bitcoin mining operations carried out by the country’s investment arm, the state-owned conglomerate Druk Holdings. Also, the United Kingdom has an account with 61,245 Bitcoins, worth more than $6 billion. It recently decided to compete with the US to make its nation a crypto hub.

""The nomination of digital asset-friendly Paul Atkins to chair the SEC provided the final boost,"" that saw bitcoin break through $100,000 to record highs, analysts led by Alex Saunders wrote.  The cryptocurrency was trading around $98,500 at the time of publication.  Bitcoin continues to be bolstered by exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows and other buying as adoption grows, the bank noted.  The macro environment is also constructive for digital assets. Loose financial conditions and resilient growth are positive for crypto tokens, Citi said.  ""Other digital assets likely have more to gain from a more permissive regulatory environment,"" the authors wrote, noting that bitcoin's dominance has fallen.  Citi said it hasn't seen a notable rise in on-chain activity.   Over the longer term, the bank said a network's utility or value will be linked to its usage, macro correlations and production costs.  A new, more benign regulatory system could unlock more and wider use cases for blockchain assets, the report added.  More permissive crypto policies should broaden the asset class, Citi said, but bitcoin, which has already been classified as a commodity, and has both a spot ETF and a futures contract, has less to gain than other tokens.

They have a notional value of $2.3 billion, which is about a quarter of last month’s massive options expiry event . The end of December’s year-end event is also set to be a huge one. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a max pain point of $97,000 and put/call ratio of 1.1, meaning that long (call) contract and short (put) contract sellers are evenly matched. Open interest, or the value or number of options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $100,000 strike price, with $2 billion in OI, but the $120,000 strike price is not far behind, according to Deribit. “Nearly two weeks of options market data has been showing that market makers are more cautious, the impact of 100,000 plus today’s retracement so that the short-term IV (implied volatility) increased significantly, options are very suitable for the short-term game at this point in time now,” observed crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live. 6 Dec Options Delivery Data 23,000 BTC options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 1.11, a maxpain point of $97,000 and a notional value of $2.3 billion. 147,000 ETH options expired with a Put Call Ratio of 0.62, a maxpain of $3,500 and a notional value of $570 million. Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/APzvJ1ohe3 — Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) December 6, 2024 “From a price action standpoint, the rally could be sustained if traders take profit from their altcoins and rotate back into BTC and ETH,” reported Deribit earlier this week before BTC topped $100,000. “With ETH within 1% of its five-month high, that would have the potential to reignite the momentum,” it added. In addition to today’s Bitcoin options, around 147,000 Ethereum contracts are expiring today. These have a notional value of $569 million, a max pain of $3,500, and a put/call ratio of 0.62, meaning there are almost twice as many call contracts expiring than puts. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.8 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Nevertheless, crypto markets took a sharp dip in late trading on Dec. 5, with total capitalization shedding almost $200 billion in a fall from its all-time high of $3.88 trillion. The move was driven by over-leveraged Bitcoin markets, causing the asset to dump below $100,000 in a flash crash below $93,000 on Dec. 5. Bitcoin hit an all-time high just below $104,000 yesterday. However, the asset has since recovered to top $98,000 during the Friday morning Asian trading session. Crypto options expiry events are unlikely to impact spot markets that much, though leverage flush-outs certainly do, as evidenced by the big correction.

While the possibility of a reversal remains pretty high, which could re-instigate the bull run. As Bitcoin gains momentum, the memecoin space also follows the trend, specifically Dogecoin & Shiba Inu. SHIB price usually follows the DOGE price rally, which is quite evident as both are facing upward pressure while PEPE gains momentum. However, the current trade setup suggests the SHIB price is set to lay down a fine upswing while DOGE & PEPE may remain within the consolidated range for a few more days. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis The weekly trade is turning bearish for the DOGE price rally as the buying pressure is failing to mount. The trading volume witnessed a drop of over 12% in the past couple of days, which has extended bearish possibility for the token. However, the technicals suggest the current accumulation may end soon, which may result in a 50% breakout close to its ATH. The daily chart of DOGE suggests the token may continue to remain sluggish for the next few days. The Bollinger bands are going parallel after displaying a huge expansion, substantiating the sideways trend. Meanwhile, the RSI is trying to enter the overbought zone despite a rejection, displaying the growing strength of the bulls. The price has faced a notable rise in the selling volume during the past trading day and now that the pressure has eased, the price is believed to range and reach the peak of the symmetric triangle. This could materialize a 50% upswing to mark levels above $0.6. Pepe (PEPE) Price Rally PEPE price is facing strong resistance, failing to surpass it for nearly a month since the November breakout. The daily candles display huge wicks on either side, suggesting the price is facing enough bullish and bearish pressure every day. With this tug-of-war situation, the bulls are expected to gain strength and elevate the levels beyond the consolidation very soon. As seen in the above chart, the PEPE price is trading along the resistance zone between $0.000022 and $0.000023. Interestingly, the DMI levels go parallel, suggesting no deviation in the price while the MACD levels remain bearish and prepare for a bullish crossover being within a positive range. Therefore, the PEPE price is believed to hover below the zone for a few more days and initiate a strong breakout to reach $0.00003. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis Being a little diverse from the other memecoins, Shiba Inu price has maintained a strong ascending trend since the start of the quarter. The price is forming constant higher highs and lows, suggesting the bulls have held a strong grip over the rally and hence the price reaching the higher target above $0.00004 could be pre-programmed. The SHIB price underwent a parabolic recovery after facing a rejection from the yearly highs at around $0.000045. The RSI has maintained a firm ascending trend, which suggests the price could hover around the resistance zone between $0.00003191 and $0.00003288 until the end of the current fortnight. The market sentiments are expected to become largely bullish, which could push the price beyond the consolidation and reach $0.00004.",NEUTRAL,DOGE | SHIB | PEPE,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/dogecoin-pepe-stuck-within-a-consolidation-while-shiba-inu-ready-for-a-30-upswing-heres-whats-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Although the decision was quickly reversed, it triggered widespread uncertainty, impacting both the stock and cryptocurrency markets. The announcement caused South Korea's stock market to decline, with the Kospi benchmark falling by 2%. Key companies like Samsung and LG Energy Solution saw their shares drop by 1% and 2.8%, respectively. To calm the situation, the government announced plans to inject nearly $7 billion into the market to prevent further chaos. Meanwhile, South Korea’s cryptocurrency market experienced a significant surge in trading volume , reaching $34.2 billion , a record for the year. This was almost double the previous high of $18 billion set earlier in December. Upbit, the nation’s leading crypto exchange, processed $27.25 billion of these transactions, underscoring its dominant role in the market. Bitcoin’s price dipped sharply during the 6-hour martial law period, falling to 88 million won ($62,182) on major exchanges as panicked traders sold their assets. The sudden spike in activity led to outages on some platforms. However, once the martial law was rescinded, markets began to stabilize, and Bitcoin’s price recovered. The president's sudden reversal of martial law has drawn criticism, with opposition parties filing charges of treason and discussing impeachment. These events highlighted the fragility of South Korea’s financial markets , particularly the vulnerability of the crypto sector to liquidity shocks during periods of political instability. While the situation calmed by Wednesday, the drama captured the attention of crypto analysts and betting markets. On Polymarket, a prediction platform, bets on President Yoon’s early resignation surged, with odds reaching 78% before settling at 47%.

37281165,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389985,1733473953,Top 5 Blockchain Disruptors This December: A New Challenger Emerges,"The post Top 5 Blockchain Disruptors This December: A New Challenger Emerges appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The blockchain industry is no stranger to innovation, with projects constantly pushing boundaries to redefine what’s possible in decentralized technology. This December, the spotlight is on five blockchain disruptors poised to challenge the status quo. Among them, a new and mysterious contender has emerged, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. Could this be the project that reshapes the landscape for 2024 and beyond? Lightchain Protocol AI Presale 1. Ethereum: Evolving Into a Powerhouse Ethereum remains a juggernaut in the blockchain world, leading the charge in smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi). The rollout of Ethereum 2.0 continues to enhance scalability and reduce energy consumption. However, its high gas fees and reliance on Layer 2 solutions leave room for competitors to fill the gaps. 2. Solana: Speed and Scalability in Real-Time Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs, Solana has solidified itself as a favorite among developers for decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. While its performance is impressive, questions about network reliability and centralization persist. Solana’s position as a disruptor could be challenged by emerging platforms offering greater decentralization and reliability. 3. Ripple (XRP): Expanding Beyond Borders Ripple continues to focus on cross-border payments, leveraging its partnerships with financial institutions worldwide. As regulatory clarity improves, Ripple’s potential to revolutionize international transactions could gain momentum. Yet, its centralized approach may make it less appealing to those seeking truly decentralized solutions. 4. Toncoin: Building a User-Centric Ecosystem Toncoin has made significant strides with its ecosystem-focused approach, offering features like tokenized economies and streamlined developer tools. With its emphasis on usability and scalability, Toncoin has drawn comparisons to Ethereum and Solana. However, the rise of new blockchain technologies could overshadow its progress. 5. The New Challenger: A Game-Changing Blockchain on the Horizon Amid the established giants, a new blockchain project has quietly entered the fray, bringing with it the promise of unprecedented innovation. While details are sparse, early reports suggest it combines blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI) to solve longstanding issues in scalability, energy efficiency, and inclusivity. Key Rumored Features: Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism: Prioritizing meaningful computational contributions over traditional mining or staking. Seamless AI Integration: Enabling decentralized applications that leverage AI for real-time decision-making, automation, and analytics. Sustainability: Designed to minimize environmental impact, addressing one of the crypto industry’s most pressing concerns. Scalability: Capable of handling high transaction volumes without sacrificing decentralization. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale This challenger could be the disruptive force the blockchain ecosystem has been waiting for, offering solutions that surpass the limitations of current platforms. What This Means for Blockchain in 2024 As these disruptors continue to push the boundaries of technology, the blockchain landscape is primed for transformation. The emergence of a new player with groundbreaking capabilities could ignite a wave of innovation, challenging incumbents and reshaping the industry. Investors and developers should keep a close watch on this new project as it positions itself to lead the next era of blockchain development. With a focus on integrating advanced technologies like AI and prioritizing inclusivity, this emerging platform could redefine the benchmarks for success in the crypto space. Final Thoughts: A Season of Disruption December 2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal moment for blockchain technology, with established players innovating and new challengers entering the arena. The disruptive potential of these five projects could usher in an exciting new chapter for the crypto world, leaving a lasting impact on industries far beyond finance.

37281195,https://coinpaprika.com/news/digital-euro-europe-s-push-for-financial-independence,1733473944,Digital Euro: Europe’s Push for Financial Independence,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is advancing plans for a digital euro , aiming to enhance payment systems in the eurozone and reduce dependence on US payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. This initiative could strengthen the region’s financial independence and promote faster, more efficient cross-border payments. Central to the project is the development of a Digital Euro Rulebook, which will set standardized guidelines for payment processes across the eurozone. By ensuring consistency, the ECB hopes to create a seamless and user-friendly experience. Feedback from consumers, retailers, and payment providers has already led to updates in the ECB’s approach. Seven new areas of focus have been identified, including user experience design and risk management. These efforts are complemented by collaborations with merchants, fintech firms, and researchers to test features like conditional payments, where transactions are triggered automatically when specific conditions are met. A detailed report on these tests is expected by July 2025. The ECB has recently invited bids from potential providers of digital euro infrastructure, with results expected in 2025. These partnerships with European companies aim to establish a robust system to support the digital currency. Understanding public preferences is also crucial, with research into consumer needs shaping the design of the digital euro to make it widely accessible and practical. Despite these advancements, not everyone supports the idea. Critics have raised concerns about the potential for increased financial surveillance and control. Some argue that central bank digital currencies ( CBDCs ) could infringe on personal freedom. For instance, one user on X warned, ""Never use the digital euro. It’s a financial surveillance and control tool. Be your own bank."" If successful, the digital euro could significantly impact global finance. By reducing reliance on non-European payment systems, it would boost the eurozone’s financial sovereignty and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. Faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments might also encourage businesses and countries outside Europe to adopt the euro for trade and investments. However, challenges remain. The ECB must navigate complex regulations and address privacy concerns. Discussions around limiting the amount of digital euros individuals can hold reflect efforts to balance financial stability with usability. Despite these hurdles, the ECB remains optimistic about refining these aspects in the coming months. The digital euro initiative represents a significant step in reshaping global finance. If it achieves its objectives, it could foster competition, enhance sovereignty, and establish the euro as a stronger player in the global financial system . The coming years will determine whether the ECB can successfully balance innovation, regulation, and public trust to make this vision a reality.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/digital-euro-europe-s-push-for-financial-independence,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37281195.jpeg
37281060,https://thecoinrise.com/multi-chain-wallet-by-qubetics-transforms-crypto-payments-while-suis-network-grows-in-defi-and-bitcoin-hits-100k/,1733473838,Multi-Chain Wallet by Qubetics Transforms Crypto Payments While SUI’s Network Grows in DeFi and Bitcoin Hits $100K,"Ever feel like the crypto world’s moving faster than you can keep up? Bitcoin’s broken the $100,000 mark, and SUI is grabbing attention with a recent surge that’s got everyone talking. But here’s the real question: what’s next? Which altcoins have the potential to blow up 1000X and change the game? That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) steps in. Unlike the usual suspects, this fresh contender isn’t just about hype—it’s about fixing what other cryptocurrencies couldn’t. With a cutting-edge multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is making crypto more practical and accessible for everyone. And if you’re into catching opportunities early, its presale is already in motion, promising a new way to tap into crypto’s future. Qubetics ($TICS): A Fresh Approach to Crypto Solutions Qubetics is stepping up with a multi-chain wallet designed to simplify crypto management. This non-custodial, open-source platform offers in-app feeless $TICS transfers, debit and virtual card options, and integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay. It even includes a decentralized VPN service and access to a tokenized asset marketplace, all in one app. Imagine a freelance graphic designer juggling payments from clients worldwide. With Qubetics’ wallet, they can receive various cryptocurrencies, convert them seamlessly, and use a virtual card for online purchases or link to Apple Pay for in-store transactions. This streamlines their financial operations, cutting down on fees and delays. Small businesses can also benefit. A local café could accept crypto payments, with Qubetics handling the conversion to stablecoins or fiat, ensuring the café gets the exact amount in dollars. This opens doors to a broader customer base without the hassle of dealing with crypto volatility. For more clearer explanation of the Qubetics project, watch this video . Qubetics Presale: A Chance to Get In Early Right now, Qubetics is deep in its 11th presale stage , and it’s making some serious noise. Over 270 million $TICS tokens have already been scooped up by more than 6,500 buyers, raking in over $4.4 million. At just $0.0282 a token, it’s a steal—but heads up, the price is set to jump by 10% when the 12th stage kicks off this weekend. Quick reminder: each presale stage runs for only seven days and wraps up every Sunday at midnight before the next price hike kicks in. Analysts are hyped about $TICS, forecasting that it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale. That’s a solid 783% ROI. Post-presale? Things look even crazier, with predictions pointing to $1 per token (a 3,434% ROI), $5 (17,570% ROI), and, after the mainnet launch, an insane $15, translating to a jaw-dropping 52,912% ROI. Here’s a breakdown for you: Imagine dropping $10,000 at today’s price of $0.0282 per token. That would snag you around 354,609 $TICS. If $TICS reaches $1, your investment is worth $354,609. At $5, you’re looking at $1,773,045. And if it skyrockets to $15? Your $10,000 turns into a mind-blowing $5,319,135. Gen Z loves a good deal, and this one’s got FOMO written all over it. SUI: Recent Developments and Market Performance SUI has been making waves in the crypto scene. Recently, it experienced a 25% price surge, trading at $1.03 on Gate.io as of September 13. This uptick is largely due to a broader market improvement that began on September 3. However, SUI faced challenges, including a significant network outage on November 21, halting block production for over an hour. This incident led to an 11% drop in SUI’s price. Despite these setbacks, SUI’s network growth is notable, with 298 million daily transactions, indicating expanding use cases in DeFi and gaming sectors. Bitcoin: Breaking New Ground Bitcoin has recently surpassed the $100,000 mark, reaching a high of $103,853. This surge is attributed to President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair, signaling a potentially more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. The approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds by the SEC has also broadened its investor base, attracting major asset managers. However, concerns about the rally’s sustainability persist, with some experts cautioning against potential market corrections. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Landscape In the ever-evolving crypto market, identifying the best altcoins with 1000X potential requires careful consideration. Qubetics ($TICS) offers innovative solutions with its multi-chain wallet and is currently in a promising presale phase. SUI shows significant network growth despite recent challenges, and Bitcoin continues to assert its dominance with record-breaking highs. For those looking to explore Qubetics further, the presale presents an opportunity to get involved early. As always, thorough research and understanding of each project’s fundamentals are crucial before making investment decisions.

Following the broader market trend, the Ripple coin hit a seven-year high, crossing the $2 mark for the first time since early 2018. Ripple’s XRP is currently trading at $2.56 , its highest price since January 2018. Despite a brief 4.7% correction, the Ripple coin has seen 81% and 409% price surges in the past week and month, respectively. A major factor fueling XRP’s recent surge is the massive adoption by South Korean investors. Analytics on South Korean exchange platforms like Upbit and Bithump show that the trading volume of XRP/KRW hit $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. As Ripple’s XRP continues its upward trend, all eyes are on FXGuys, a trading platform boosting traders’ profits. AIOZ Network Receives Positive Signals Due to Upcoming Platform Upgrades AIOZ Network has been one of the top gainers this quarter despite its consolidation below $0.03 in 2023. AIOZ is currently valued at $1.10 , its highest level in the past three years, triggered by the platform’s new upgrades. The protocol recently partnered with Artfi, an Art technology platform, to enhance the security and proper management of NFTs. This milestone has given AIOZ Network a noteworthy boost, and many expect the project’s enhanced infrastructure could further boost its prices. AIOZ’s price surged 43.45% within the last seven days, and some experts predict that the project could reach $1 in January 2025.

37282631,https://invezz.com/?p=2371948,1733473710,"Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP) new all-time highs delayed as crypto bulls get distracted by Polygon (POL) and another coin racing toward $1","Cardano and Ripple have had a notable run in recent weeks, and they are looking set to break their all-time highs. Still, delays in their price advancement have shifted investor attention to rising stars such as Polygon (POL). Meanwhile, Rexas Finance (RXS), a new cryptocurrency project, is garnering attention due to its remarkable presale success and positioning itself as the next big thing in asset tokenization. ADA and XRP’s new ATH delayed Both Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) have had bullish outlooks, particularly following recent price increases, although their ability to achieve new all-time highs appears to be on hold. Cardano (ADA) increased by 140% in November, owing primarily to euphoria around the US presidential election, with hopes of crypto-friendly legislation if Donald Trump is reelected. However, ADA faces potential downside risks as it approaches the pinnacle of a rising wedge pattern on its chart. This technical configuration frequently indicates a breakdown, with analysts predicting ADA might fall to as low as $0.513 by December, wiping out a significant amount of its recent gains. The 35% decline might be compounded by falling volumes and a bearish divergence in the RSI, indicating upward momentum waning. Ripple (XRP) has likewise struggled to maintain pace since surpassing the $2.10 resistance level. While the coin has been consolidating, experts are concerned about its potential to surpass prior highs without strong catalysts. A correction phase, similar to prior trends, could see XRP retrace lower before making another attempt to regain its former milestone. The market’s focus has been diverted by fresh initiatives like Rexas Finance, postponing XRP’s chase of new highs shortly. Rexas Finance (RXS) racing toward $1 Rexas Finance (RXS) is silently turning out to be the next big project in the crypto market amid the uproar about ADA and XRP. Rexas Finance stands out from other projects in that it approaches real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, which offers formerly closed access to a vast spectrum of asset classes behind major financial constraints. Blockchain technology allows Rexas Finance to tokenize physical and intangible assets, enabling their acquisition, sale, and trading as digital commodities. In barely three months, Rexas Finance has achieved significant milestones. The presale is currently in Stage 9, with RXS tokens priced at $0.125, and has already raised more than $20.75 million through the sale of 290 million RXS tokens. The presale has moved fast, replicating the success of previous phases, which witnessed a 250% price increase from the initial price of $0.03. The project’s run indicates sustained interest and growth from early investors. Rexas Finance is more accessible and community-driven. It decided to forsake usual venture capital funding in favor of a public presale. By keeping its tokenomics transparent and community-focused, Rexas Finance wants to scale swiftly and promote wider platform adoption. Rexas Finance plans to launch on at least three of the world’s top ten exchanges, further cementing its position in the cryptocurrency market. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have already listed the project, allowing investors to obtain data on RXS coin performance easily. Furthermore, Rexas Finance underwent a Certik audit, an important step toward ensuring the platform’s security and resilience, and it passed the audit. Certik is well-known for offering high-level blockchain security assessments, and its certification lends legitimacy to the project by ensuring investors that the network follows strict security rules. The incentives to invest in Rexas Finance are difficult to ignore. The project currently hosts a $1 giveaway in which 20 participants will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. This method encourages participation and increases awareness of the initiative as more individuals attend the presale. Analysts predict a 100x rise from Rexas Finance’s listing price of $0.20 upon its planned listing on major exchanges. This explains why bulls ditch Cardano and Ripple for Rexas Finance in the ongoing bull cycle. Bulls accumulate Polygon Polygon (POL) has seen a surge in whale activity, with token transactions reaching more than 59 million in just 48 hours. This increase comes as the network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has risen above $1 billion after a drop earlier this year. This purchase binge reflects renewed confidence in Polygon, with Layer 2 scaling solutions drawing developers and institutional interest, preparing the ecosystem for future growth. As of this writing, POL is trading in a crucial consolidation range of $0.58 and $0.62. A break above $0.60 might set the stage for a surge to $0.75 and possibly $1.50. Whale activity shows that POL may continue to grow as Polygon’s ecology expands and matures. While ADA and XRP are experiencing delays in hitting all-time highs, Polygon and Rexas Finance (RXS) are on track for huge growth, with massive bull actions in recent weeks. As Rexas Finance gains traction, it is unquestionably one of the most promising projects in the cryptocurrency market. Investors should consider seizing the chance before the official launch, as the project is ready for a significant breakout.

37280981,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623612,1733473509,Wall Street bulls hail Bitcoin’s $100K surge as a bullish indicator,"Bitcoin’s price smashed through $100,000 late Wednesday night, setting a new all-time high that has Wall Street analysts excited. The apex crypto, which peaked at $103,844 before pulling back slightly to $101,000, is now being hailed as a key indicator for broader market trends. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes it signals a bigger move ahead for the U.S. stock market, which is already seeing record highs. Bitcoin is now up more than 140% this year and has surged 45% since the U.S. election. Investors are piling in, betting that President-elect Donald Trump’s administration will continue to deliver on its promises to support the crypto industry. Lee predicts the S&P 500 could climb to 6,300 before the year’s end, urging investors to buy during market dips. “Investors are pro-risk,” he said. Trump’s pro-crypto agenda drives market confidence Trump has wasted no time reassuring crypto investors. On Wednesday, he announced his plan to nominate Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Atkins, a well-known crypto advocate, is expected to roll back the strict enforcement tactics of outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Under him, the SEC adopted a regulation-by-enforcement strategy that made the crypto industry a prime target for fines and lawsuits. Trump’s decision to nominate Atkins aligns with his campaign promise to overhaul crypto regulations and launch a strategic national crypto stockpile. The news electrified Bitcoin enthusiasts. Trump even took to Truth Social Thursday morning to celebrate the milestone . “You’re welcome,” he posted, crediting his campaign promises and policies for helping Bitcoin reach $100,000. Trump added that this is just the beginning. Tom Lee sees Bitcoin’s rally as a reflection of investor confidence in Trump’s pro-business and deregulation agenda. Small-cap stocks are also expected to benefit from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts, which are likely to boost liquidity and drive more risk-taking. Stock markets ride the bullish wave Stock futures traded near flat levels Friday morning as investors awaited November’s labor market data. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures remained steady. Analysts expect the nonfarm payrolls report to show 214,000 new jobs in November, a sharp increase from October’s dismal 12,000. This labor market strength is likely to play a role in the Federal Reserve’s upcoming December meeting, where policymakers will decide on interest rates . Despite the flat trading session, this week has been positive for equities. The S&P 500 is up 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has gained 2.5%. The Dow, however, is down 0.3% as profit-taking continues in some sectors. Meanwhile, corporate earnings are adding fuel to the bullish sentiment. Once dismissed as a speculative bubble, the cryptocurrency is now seen as a serious asset class. Institutional investors are increasingly embracing Bitcoin , while governments are reevaluating their regulatory stances. For crypto enthusiasts, Bitcoin’s ascent to $100,000 feels like vindication after years of boom-and-bust cycles and resistance from traditional financial institutions.

This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-rescues-usa-trumpusa-solana-memecoin-will-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shib-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37280754,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389970,1733473171,"Stellar and Hedera See Weekly Declines, Analysts Highlight Lunex Network As an Alternative","The post Stellar and Hedera See Weekly Declines, Analysts Highlight Lunex Network As an Alternative appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Stellar and Hedera have faced weekly declines, raising concerns among investors. Stellar struggled with reduced trading volume, while Hedera encountered selling pressure despite its strong fundamentals. By comparison, analysts see Lunex Network as a possible alternative. With its revolutionary decentralized exchange, privacy-focused features, and increasing investor interest, Lunex Network might be a game changer. Stellar’s Trading Volume Falls By Over 60% Stellar’s XLM jumped over 470% on the month chart to join the leading fifteen cryptos with a market cap of $16.38 billion. XLM presently trades at $0.5036 with a $15.16 billion market capitalization. The altcoin’s daily trading volume leaped to $3.10 billion but is now down to $1.7 billion. A partnership between Felix, Bitso, and the Stellar network is allowing cross-border remittances for Latinos in the U.S. which uses blockchain or USDC stablecoin to send money more quickly, cheaper, and safer to Latin America. Felix, a WhatsApp payment platform, and Latin American crypto exchange Bitso have brought remittances closer. Using USDC on the Stellar network, transactions now take seconds instead of hours or days. These secure transactions also cost significantly less than traditional methods. Hedera’s Bullish Momentum Slows Down Hedera (HBAR) is a blockchain network with real-world applications largely in finance & insurance. Hedera’s integration with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FedNow payment system signals the altcoin’s ability to transform national transaction processing. Currently, Hedera is trading at $0.2958 after experiencing a slight dip on its weekly chart. Hedera’s price has corrected in the last twenty-four hours due to a wider crypto market sell-off with $536 million in liquidations. If Hedera breaks the resistance at $0.299, analysts think more buyers might purchase and the altcoin might reach $0.30 or $0.45. A correction may however cause short-term pullbacks with support around $0.17. Also, the new privacy layer further solidifies Hedera’s position in the blockchain business. This innovation by Dr Leemon Baird enables users to run private instances of the Hedera network while being connected to the public network. This technology may allow secure and interoperable private uses in finance, supply chain, and healthcare sectors. How Lunex Network’s Early Market Positioning Could Yield High Returns for Investors Lunex Network (LNEX) provides a user-centric DeFi ecosystem which has changed the market outlook. The trading platform’s non-custodial style allows users to have control over their assets and trade easily. By supporting over 40 blockchains and a wide range of features, Lunex Network sets a high standard for interoperability and efficiency.

This feature allows users to spend their cryptocurrency wealth directly, showcasing the platform’s practical utility. By combining innovation, security, and user-friendly features, Lunex Network attracts traders and investors. The recent surges of Stellar and Hedera signal a shift in the DeFi crypto market. Lunex Network stands out with its promising potential, emerging from a market growing at a compound annual rate of 43.8%. With $LNEX priced at $0.0038, investors have a rare chance to secure an early stake in a project poised to become a major player.

According to a press release , Worksport’s Board of Directors approved $5 million for the acquisition of Bitcoin and XRP. This move underscores the company’s long-standing belief in crypto as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Four Components of Worksport Crypto Strategy Per the press release, the company highlighted four components of its Bitcoin and XRP strategy. The first strategy involves using 10% of its excess operational cash reserve for XRP and Bitcoin acquisition. With the company’s excess cash reserve standing at around $50 million, a maximum of $5 million will be allocated to its initial investment in Bitcoin and XRP. Second, Worksport will accept crypto payments, including XRP and Bitcoin, on its e-commerce platform. This move aims to enhance customer experience, expand Worksport’s payment options, and drastically reduce payment processing costs by up to 37%. Furthermore, Worksport plans to convert the interest earned from its cash savings in money market accounts to Bitcoin and XRP. If the firm implements this, it will gradually increase its exposure to the two cryptocurrencies.Lastly, Worksport proposed using a portion of its future capital fundraising to increase its Bitcoin and XRP holdings. Through this effort, Worksport intends to make both assets a major part of its financial strategy. Worksport CEO ReactsCommenting on the development, Worksport CEO Steven Rossi said the company’s decision to adopt Bitcoin and XRP shows its commitment to stay ahead of market trends. He added that both assets could complement Worksport’s existing payment methods, especially as the company seeks to expand its global reach. Why Worksport Added XRP to Its Crypto Strategy Companies like MicroStrategy have been diversifying their treasury holdings with Bitcoin. However, only a few have converted their excess cash reserves to XRP. Explaining the motive behind including XRP in its crypto strategy, Rossi pointed out that the coin is gradually becoming a stable currency. Although he expects XRP to become volatile in the near future, he still believes the coin will retain some of its stability, introducing some upward potential.Interestingly, Worksport CEO revealed that he owns XRP, which he invested in a few years ago. He expressed enthusiasm about the asset’s spectacular performance, which saw it surge to nearly $3 this week. In the meantime, XRP is trading at $2.34, reflecting a massive gain of 43.72% over the past week. Meanwhile, Worksport’s crypto strategy has positively impacted the company’s stock, which trades on Nasdaq. Following the announcement, WKSP spiked by 9.07% to $0.68. At press time, WKSP is trading at $0.66, with a market cap of $21.94 million.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/06/new-york-based-worksport-to-acquire-xrp-for-its-corporate-strategy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-york-based-worksport-to-acquire-xrp-for-its-corporate-strategy,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

However, market sentiment remains fragile as Bitcoin dominance threatens to overshadow altcoin rallies. Pav Hundal, lead analyst at Swyftx, warned that if Bitcoin dominance rises further, XRP bulls could face severe liquidation pressures. “The real danger right now for highly leveraged XRP bulls is that Bitcoin dominance increases again,” said Hundal. “A rotation from XRP to Bitcoin would very likely lead to a bloodbath of liquidations.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s market dominance stood at 55.30%, marking a 5% drop over the past week. Analysts speculate this figure could climb to the 60%-70% range before capital flows back into altcoins. XRP Long Positions Hundal noted a surge in leveraged long positions on XRP, indicating heightened market risk. “We’ve seen quick twitch buying by retail over the last few weeks, with open interest now almost double the levels observed in 2021,” he explained. XRP’s price, currently at $2.37, faces a precarious situation. A retracement to $2.18 would erase $104.4 million in long positions, underscoring the potential for sharp liquidations. Since Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential win on November 5, XRP has skyrocketed by 431%, peaking at $2.85 on December 3. However, its massive rise has brought concerns of a market approaching “euphoria territory,” according to Hundal. XRP’s open interest stood at $3.44 billion as of December 5, significantly higher than the $2 billion recorded in April 2021. The XRP/BTC ratio has also climbed to 0.00002375, reflecting a 47.6% increase over the past month. Bitcoin Stability Could Offer Relief Market stability remains a focal point as Bitcoin’s performance could either stabilize nerves or exacerbate volatility. Hundal suggested that Bitcoin maintaining its current levels might encourage renewed interest in spot trading volumes. “The funding rates on Binance are not overheating, but they’re quite warm across other exchanges,” he observed. “Anything exceeding 50% on the one-year funding rate heatmap is generally viewed as exuberant.” Despite its recent downturn, XRP’s robust rally earlier highlights its appeal among traders. However, the road ahead will likely depend on Bitcoin’s dominance and broader market sentiment.

37280397,https://crypto.news/?p=14316762,1733472565,Australia targets non-compliant crypto ATM operators with new task force,"Australia has established a task force to crack down on cryptocurrency ATM providers that do not comply with the nation’s anti-money laundering laws. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre has issued a warning for crypto ATM operators via a Dec. 6 statement , noting that non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws will result in enforcement actions and penalties. Coin ATM Radar data shows Australia as the third-largest hub for Bitcoin and crypto ATMs globally, with over 1,300 machines in operation. However, AUSTRAC, which put the number at around 1,200, claims only a small fraction of the country’s 400 registered digital currency exchanges operate these machines, making them a focal point for regulatory scrutiny. According to AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas, cryptocurrency and crypto ATMs have become “attractive avenues for criminals” due to their accessibility and ability to facilitate “near-instant and irreversible transfers.” You might also like: Australia’s AUSTRAC warns of crypto’s growing role in illicit activities As such, the agency will focus on eliminating non-compliant, high-risk operations throughout the next year to reduce the criminal misuse of cryptocurrency in Australia. “We’re seeing too many Australians falling victim to scams carried out through cryptocurrency, As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so too will criminal exploitation, which is why this taskforce will work to eliminate non-compliant high-risk operations.” Brendan Thomas, AUSTRAC CEO Crypto ATM operators in Australia must adhere to anti-money laundering obligations, including registering with AUSTRAC, conducting Know Your Customer checks, monitoring transactions, and reporting suspicious activities, including large cash transactions involving amounts over 10,000 AUD (roughly $6,430). The task force will monitor the sector to ensure that crypto ATM operators comply with these rules and minimize the risks the kiosks pose, such as facilitating money laundering, scams, and other illicit activities. The recent warning aligns with AUSTRAC’s stance that digital currencies and exchanges pose significant money laundering and terrorism financing risks. In its 2024 National Risk Assessment Report , the agency identified cryptocurrencies as a “high” risk channel to enable illicit activities. It warned that these risks are expected to increase over the next three years. Beyond Australia, some other jurisdictions have also turned their focus to regulating crypto ATMs to curb illicit activities. In late August, German regulators confiscated 13 crypto ATMs in a sting operation and warned that unlicensed operators would face severe penalties, including jail time of up to 5 years. Similarly, in the UK, during a money laundering case against an illegal operator, the Financial Conduct Authority declared that no crypto ATMs are legally operating in the country.

The BFI evaluates several aspects of the Bitcoin market, including wallet activity and transaction volume. When it declines, the risk of a market correction increases. “Not to rain on the parade, but Bitcoin has crossed $100,000, yet the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI) is starting to weaken. Should we be concerned? This indicator often sends early warning signals, and once confirmed, they’re hard to ignore. Take the market peak in Q1 this year as an example: the BFI showed the exit point ahead of a significant correction. For now, we’ll keep monitoring, but the bull run still has fuel left.” Source: Negentropic/X Prior to Bitcoin breaking the $100,000 resistance level, the analysts said the net realized profit/loss metric, which tracks whether Bitcoin holders are selling at a loss or a profit, indicated holders were waiting for higher price targets before they’d likely start taking profits. “Bitcoin traders hold out for higher levels. Another sign of Bitcoin’s price consolidation is traders’ reluctance to take profits in this range. They’re aiming for higher levels, expecting gains once Bitcoin starts challenging key resistances. Once Bitcoin overcomes its resistance and establishes itself above $100,000, we’ll likely witness spikes to the upside on this chart, signaling trader confidence turning into action.” Source: Negentropic/X Bitcoin is trading for $96,579 at time of writing, down 6.8% from its new all-time high of $103,679.

While in the White House, he branded Bitcoin a scam and stated it threatened the dollar.However, Trump changed his disposition towards the asset in his last campaign, promising to support the nascent industry's growth if elected. He made history by becoming the first president to pay for items using Bitcoin after purchasing burgers at PubKey with the asset.Trump also made a few promises to the crypto industry amid millions of dollars' worth of donations. Among them is his pledge to create a strategic Bitcoin US, ensure a friendly regulatory environment for the asset, and support crypto mining in the country.Notably, the president has delivered on some of his promises, including forcing SEC chair Gary Gensler to resign and appointing a pro-crypto replacement.

Do XRP ETFs Stand A Chance?,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly notified at least two of the five applicants seeking approval for Solana (SOL) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that their filings will be rejected. This development, reported by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett on X, highlights the SEC’s reluctance to greenlight cryptocurrency ETFs under the current administration. Terrett noted, “The consensus here, I’m told, is that the SEC won’t entertain any new crypto ETFs under the current administration.” This announcement has drawn attention from the broader cryptocurrency community, particularly advocates of XRP, as several firms have recently filed applications for XRP ETFs .

After losing a lawsuit to Grayscale about ETF approval, the regulator finally approved Bitcoin ETFs in January, and Ethereum ETFs followed some months later. Since then, many companies have filed ETFs for digital assets like Solana, XRP, and more. One commenter speculated that since the SEC only notified two of the five applicants, it might still approve at least one of the other three. Terrett clarified the situation, stating , “The SEC won’t approve just one or a couple and not the others. Remember the bitcoin ETFs? Eleven launched on the same day.” This statement suggests that the regulator has no plans to approve any ETFs under the current administration. XRP ETF Applications in Limbo The agency’s perceived hostility toward cryptocurrencies has been a source of frustration for market participants. SEC Chair Gary Gensler also seems to be doing all he can to sabotage the crypto market’s progress.

We can wait 6 weeks,” reflecting the general sentiment that ETF approval may become more attainable under new leadership. While the SEC’s rejection of SOL spot ETF filings may signal a temporary roadblock for cryptocurrency ETFs, the impending change in leadership has reignited hope within the crypto community.

37280130,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658089,1733472058,"Bitcoin On Track To Replace Gold In 10 Years, Trading Firm Predicts","Bitcoin (BTC) shattered the $100,000 price milestone yesterday, reaching as high as $104,088 on Binance crypto exchange. This historic price action has prompted analysts at the trading firm Bernstein to assert that Bitcoin is well-positioned to replace gold within the next decade. Bitcoin Poised To Outshine Gold Over Next Decade, Bernstein Says In a client note released earlier today, Bernstein analysts, led by Gautam Chhugani, expressed confidence that Bitcoin will eventually assume gold’s role as a reliable safe-haven asset. The note stated: We expect Bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier ‘store of value’ asset eventually replacing Gold over the next decade, and becoming a permanent part of institutional multi-asset allocation and a standard for corporate treasury management. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Bitcoin is up an impressive 141%. However, the lion’s share of these gains came following the victory of pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump in the November US presidential election. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hits Historic $104,000: Key Factors Fueling The Surge The cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in optimism following Trump’s victory, as the president-elect is expected to create a favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Since November 4, the total crypto market cap has climbed from $2.4 trillion to $3.9 trillion at the time of writing – a staggering 62.5% increase. In the note, Bernstein predicts that BTC may rise to $200,000 by late 2025. The trading firm’s forecast aligns with Charles Edwards’ – founder of Capriole Investments – prediction that BTC can potentially double in value within weeks, as its relatively smaller market cap enables more rapid price movements. BTC Adoption Major Driver Behind Its Success Bernstein’s bullish outlook was reinforced by Gil Luria, a D.A. Davidson analyst, who identified mainstream adoption as the key driver behind Bitcoin’s success. However, he cautioned that Bitcoin still has a “long path ahead” before it is widely accepted as a medium of exchange and unit of account. Luria added: Bitcoin’s main current application as a store of value — an appreciating, low-correlation asset that replaces gold as a hedge against a decline in economic stability. While Bitcoin is yet to achieve widespread use as a currency, it has gained significant traction as a reliable asset class for corporate balance sheets. Recently, Hut 8, a leading crypto-mining firm, announced plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

However, analysts are pointing out that Litecoin (LTC) and crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) also see high volumes. Rollblock’s record-breaking crypto presale is racing toward $7 million sold as this top altcoin prepares for over 100x growth out of its highly anticipated ICO. Cardano Monthly Rally Fueled by Relentless Technical Upgrades In a little over one month, the Cardano price has gone from one of the year’s worst performers to one of its best. Cardano’s monthly rally of 270% has dragged it from a deep loss for 2024 to an almost 100% gain. Analysts attribute this impressive rebound to Cardano’s commitment to constant innovation. No sooner had Cardano completed its Chang upgrade than it announced its next big upgrade: midnight. The Midnight upgrade’s focus on the rapidly expanding DeFi sector has analysts expecting even more explosive growth for the Cardano price in 2025. Litecoin Stays at Centre of Expanding Web3 Thanks to Brand A growing Web3 economy has been a boon for the Litecoin price this month. Litecoin’s 35% rally in this week alone has brought its total monthly return to over 100%. Litecoin’s long-established brand makes it one of the top choices for merchants in the growing Web3 economy. These Web3 merchants are willing to overlook Litecoin’s slipping transaction technology in favor of the sense of security that its brand provides for customers. At the current rate of Web3 expansion, the Litecoin price is expected to continue its rapid ascent through 2025. Rollblock CoinMarketCap Listing Sends Sales Volumes Soaring Rollblock’s relative sales volumes are outperforming even Cardano and Litecoin thanks to its fresh listing on the popular CoinMarketCap website. Rollblock has now broken numerous crypto presale records as it races toward the $7 million market capitalization milestone. This top altcoin has already broken numerous presale records thanks to the enormous popularity of its crypto-gambling platform. Moreover, The vast potential of the $500 billion in revenue that is there for the taking in the gambling industry.

Rollblock now offers the same blockchain excellence for sports betting after its recent expansion. Rollblock’s listing on the CoinMarketCap platform is expected to supercharge the rate of sales as even more investors learn about its excellent crypto gambling platform and its signature profit-sharing program.

37279402,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373662,1733470770,"Cardano Whales Keep Buying, Is ADA Poised to Hit $1.5 Next?","TL:DR; Cardano’s native token continues to see a lot of demand from whales, with another massive accumulation over the past day or so. These big purchases could lead to price increases for the underlying asset, which is predicted to continue its run and hit $1.5 next. ADA’s Current Run The so-called ‘Trump Pump’ initially missed ADA. While the rest of the market, led by BTC and DOGE, was charting massive gains, Cardano’s token remained relatively still at around $0.3. That all changed during the first weekend after the elections when IOG Founder Charles Hoskinson said he would work alongside the Trump administration to establish crypto regulations in the States. ADA skyrocketed immediately by double-digits and kept climbing in the following weeks amid the overall resurgance in the market, as well as other big hints by Hoskinson. The cryptocurrency’s ascent culminated on December 3, when it jumped to just over $1.3 for the first time in almost three years. Since then, though, ADA has retraced slightly to $1.2 after an 8% correction. The question now arises of what would push the asset further north and whether it can reach some of the big predictions made by analysts, including a price tag of up to $6. Whales on the Move Crypto whales tend to impact the market due to their ability to purchase or offload large portions of a certain asset. Consequently, their behavior could determine the upcoming price movements of a token. Recall that Cardano whales accumulated 130 million coins during the retracement at the end of November and the asset’s price jumped in the following days from $0.9 to the aforementioned peak of $1.3. The popular analyst Ali outlined another massive purchase by these large investors for more than 100 million ADA within the span of 24 hours. #Cardano whales bought over 100 million $ADA in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/IrZjA54tGy — Ali (@ali_charts) December 5, 2024 This could lead to even further gains for ADA, as many experts have predicted that its next target is precisely $1.5, which means another 25% surge from its current levels. Ali, for instance, believes the asset has formed an “ascending triangle like it was extracted from a textbook” that could drive ti to that target.

37280976,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51498,1733470555,Top Analyst Calls Cardano (ADA) Price All-Time High. Here’s the Timeline,"Prominent crypto analyst Dan Gambardello has offered an optimistic projection for Cardano (ADA), predicting that the cryptocurrency could achieve a new all-time high within the next 30 to 60 days. His outlook is based on historical market data, recent technological advancements, and political developments favoring blockchain innovation. Technological Milestones Strengthen Cardano’s Position Gambardello highlighted significant technological progress as a key factor supporting his bullish forecast. Cardano recently demonstrated the ability to process over 1 million transactions per second (TPS) through its Hydra scaling solution . This milestone was achieved while successfully running a complex application, showcasing the network’s scalability and readiness to handle large transaction volumes. These advancements bolster Cardano’s reputation as one of the most capable blockchains in the crypto space. Gambardello also pointed out that upcoming Bitcoin interoperability, scheduled for release in 2025, could further enhance Cardano’s position in the market. He suggested that these developments could make Cardano “the most relevant blue chip in crypto.” Political Developments and Regulatory Optimism The analyst noted that political changes might also contribute to the positive sentiment around Cardano . One key development is the appointment of Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner, as the SEC chairman. Atkins, a vocal advocate for blockchain innovation, participated in a Cardano-focused conference in 2020. Gambardello emphasized that Atkins’ involvement could signal a shift toward greater regulatory clarity and institutional acceptance for blockchain projects like Cardano. He believes this regulatory optimism could drive additional interest and investment into ADA. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Analysis Suggests Imminent Breakout From a technical standpoint, Cardano is currently testing critical resistance levels that Gambardello named the “bull market doors.” He said during past market cycles, ADA often experienced notable pullbacks before breaking through these levels and rallying significantly. Based on these historical patterns, the analyst anticipates a sharp upward movement that could propel Cardano to surpass $3 by the end of December. However, Gambardello advised investors to prepare for potential short-term volatility, referencing past 30-40% dips before major rallies. Path to All-Time Highs and Long-Term Potential Cardano’s previous all-time high of $3.10 remains a target for the network’s supporters. At its current trading price of $1.19—following a remarkable 260% increase over the past month—ADA is still 61% below this peak. Reaching a new high would require an additional rally of approximately 158%. Despite potential short-term fluctuations, Gambardello remains confident in Cardano’s long-term trajectory. He emphasized the importance of the next two months as a critical period for ADA, urging investors to closely follow its developments.

37279117,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389874,1733470201,XRP Price to Plunge $2? As Rising Bitcoin Dominance Could Crush XRP Bulls,"The post XRP Price to Plunge $2? As Rising Bitcoin Dominance Could Crush XRP Bulls appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, which experienced an impressive 335% gain in just one month, is now facing the threat of a significant price drop. After reaching its yearly high of $2.85 on December 3, XRP has already declined by nearly 18%. However, crypto expert Pav Hundal has raised concerns that if Bitcoin dominance continues to increase, XRP could drop to $2. With money already starting to shift back into Bitcoin, this could lead to a large sell-off in XRP, potentially wiping out long positions. Bitcoin Dominance Is the Real Threat Bitcoin dominance, which is currently sitting at 55.28% , has dropped slightly this week. However, Hundal hints that if it rises to 60-70%, the market could see a big shift as investors move their money from altcoins like XRP back into Bitcoin. XRP’s recent surge has made it a popular asset among traders, with open interest in XRP reaching new highs. This surge in leveraged positions, paired with XRP’s price retracing, could result in massive liquidations if the market continues to decline. Hundal mentioned that XRP longs are still being added, even as prices fall, signaling that the market may be approaching a “dangerous zone.” Meanwhile, the XRP/BTC ratio, which shows how strong XRP is compared to Bitcoin, is currently 0.00002375. This has increased by 2.7% since December 5 and by 47% over the past month. Additionally, Hundal suggests that if Bitcoin’s price becomes stable, it could calm the market and increase trading activity. XRP’s recent price surge has caught the attention of many investors—read our XRP price prediction to see where it’s headed next and stay ahead of the curve! Ripple Effect of Ripple’s Delay Adding to the uncertainty, Ripple’s recent delay in launching its RLUSD stablecoin has caused concerns among investors. This delay has led XRP to lose its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, falling behind USDT. XRP Bulls in Trouble? As of now, XRP is trading at $2.37, reflecting a slight price drop seen in the last 24 hours. If the price drops just 7% more, around $104 million in XRP long positions could be wiped out. XRP’s failure to break through the $2.50 resistance is putting even more pressure on the token, and the market cap has dropped below $134 billion. However, the next support level for XRP is near $2.20, with a potential further decline toward $2.00 if the bearish trend continues. But if it can clear the $2.50 resistance, we could see a rise to $2.70 or even $3.00. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37292538,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104068,1733469518,Market Analyst Says Time is Approaching for Cardano to Flip Dogecoin,"Amid the recent Cardano purple patch and Dogecoin’s underwhelming outing, an analyst has speculated that ADA would flip the meme coin in market cap. An analysis of Cardano and Dogecoin shows that the former has recently outperformed the meme coin king. For context, Cardano has grown 14.4% in the past seven days, while Dogecoin has appreciated 7%.The high-utility L1 token also outmatched the meme coin king in higher timeframes. In the past 30 days, Cardano is up a staggering 233%, while Dogecoin has managed a 116% growth.Time is Approaching for the Flip: AnalystAmid the ongoing price movements, notable Cardano bull and market expert Dan Gambardello has envisioned an ambitious event where ADA will flip Dogecoin in market rankings. In an X post on Thursday, he speculated on the event, presenting the price Cardano must attain to secure the move.Notably, after flipping Cardano earlier in the year, Dogecoin surpassed XRP and USDC to become the sixth-largest crypto by market cap amid a $69 billion valuation last month. However, the meme coin has receded considerably from its November peak of $0.47992 and is currently valued at $64 billion. Meanwhile, Cardano has been on a bullish outbreak spurred by strong macroeconomic boosts around its ecosystem. ADA reached a multi-month price high earlier in December, pushing its market cap to an intramonth high of $45.8 billion.With the bullish event unfolding for Cardano, Gambardello has speculated that Cardano will soon surpass Dogecoin. He inferred that a surge to $1.84 would send Cardano past Dogecoin as the market stands.The analyst stated that the time for Cardano to hit $1.84 per coin is approaching. Hence, the flip event is imminent. Cardano to $1.84 Soon?Notably, Gambardello’s imminent assertion implies he is speculating Cardano will trade at $1.84 soon. However, he did not place a timeline for the price attainment or the Dogecoin overthrow.For context, with a total supply of $45 billion, a surge to $1.84 would push Cardano to a market cap of $64.63 billion. At the current market condition, this is slightly above Dogecoin's current cap of $64.3 billion.Meanwhile, the analyst earlier asserted an ADA push to $3. The Crypto Basic reported that the Cardano bull stated that the coin would surge to the price if it received exchange-traded fund (ETF) news like XRP did.Nonetheless, analysts have placed higher price predictions for Cardano, with Ali Martinez insisting on a surge to $6 . Market pundit Lark Davis also asserted that the asset would ultimately hit $10 this cycle.In the meantime, Cardano trades at $1.19, down less than 1% in the past 24 hours and with a market cap of $41.81 billion.",POSITIVE,ADA | XRP,ADA | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/06/market-analyst-says-time-is-approaching-for-cardano-to-flip-dogecoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-analyst-says-time-is-approaching-for-cardano-to-flip-dogecoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Trump’s new crypto and AI ‘czar’,"David Sacks, a prominent venture capitalist and former PayPal executive, has been appointed as the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar” by US President-elect Donald Trump. Known for his deregulatory stance, Sacks is expected to focus on providing regulatory clarity for digital assets while adopting a light-touch approach to AI governance. @jason @Jason · Follow Congrats to my bestie @DavidSacks on his new position as “White House AI & Crypto Czar” 🚀 6:35 AM · Dec 6, 2024 12.3K Reply Copy link Read 700 replies Who is David Sacks? Born in South Africa and now 52 years old, David Sacks has had a storied career in technology and business. He is a founding member of the “PayPal Mafia,” a group of influential tech entrepreneurs that includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. During his tenure as PayPal’s COO, he helped establish the platform as a leading payment processor before it was acquired by eBay in 2002. David Sacks @DavidSacks · Follow 10:51 AM · Dec 6, 2024 7.7K Reply Copy link Read 755 replies Sacks later founded Yammer, an enterprise social network that Microsoft purchased for $1.2 billion in 2012. He also served as CEO of Zenefits and co-founded Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm that has backed successful startups like SpaceX, Reddit, and ClickUp. David Sacks and his support for cryptocurrencies Sacks has been a vocal advocate for cryptocurrencies, describing them as fulfilling the “original vision” of PayPal—a system where payments remain within a secure, decentralized network. In a 2017 interview with CNBC, he called Bitcoin and Ethereum revolutionary, likening them to a “decentralized web” or an “internet of money.” His hands-on experience with cryptocurrencies extends to holding assets like Solana (SOL) and investing in blockchain startups. Sacks’ technical and commercial understanding of digital currencies is seen as a significant advantage as he takes on his new role. While Sacks has not been as outspoken about artificial intelligence, his approach to governance aligns with the views of Silicon Valley’s libertarian-leaning investors. Observers predict he will prioritize regulating the use of AI in critical applications rather than imposing heavy restrictions on AI development—a stance that contrasts with more stringent regulatory efforts like California’s failed SB 1047 bill. What will be David Sacks’ responsibilities as Crypto and AI ‘Czar’? In his new role, Sacks will oversee the development of a comprehensive legal framework for the cryptocurrency industry, addressing the lack of clarity that has hindered its growth in the US. This includes leading a newly established White House advisory council on science and technology. Additionally, he will work alongside other Trump-appointed officials, including Paul Atkins at the SEC, to ensure that US policy fosters innovation while implementing necessary guardrails. Sacks’ deregulatory leanings suggest a pro-growth environment for digital assets and AI, aligning with Trump’s vision to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet.” Industry and peer reactions Sacks’ appointment has been met with enthusiasm from industry leaders.

If you missed Mog Coin’s successful ICO, you’re not alone in your quiet longing for a better chance. Mog Coin rode the wave of internet nostalgia and delivered big rewards to its early adopters. But for those who missed the boat, the story isn’t over. Enter BTFD Coin , a meme coin built not just on humour but on solid fundamentals and a bullish outlook. Its presale has already raised over $1 million in under 10 days, selling more than 23 billion tokens to a community of over 2,400 holders. If Mog Coin was a cultural moment, BTFD Coin could be your chance to write your own crypto success story. Mog Coin: The Meme King That Captured Internet Hearts Every cat lover in Scandinavia will tell you that nothing unites people like a good feline meme. Mog Coin, inspired by the iconic Mog meme, brought a touch of warmth and whimsy to the cryptocurrency world. Launched with a focus on community and nostalgia, Mog Coin was a masterstroke in marrying internet culture with blockchain technology. During its ICO, Mog Coin was priced at just $0.000015 per token, and early investors quickly saw returns as the coin’s value surged. By the end of its first quarter, Mog Coin had doubled its market cap, supported by engaging campaigns and an active DAO that funded projects benefiting animal welfare—a cause close to many Nordic hearts. But its true charm lay in its purring potential. With every transaction, a portion was burned, making it a deflationary token. Mog Coin didn’t just offer a meme; it promised long-term rewards to its holders. Unfortunately, like an elusive aurora borealis, Mog Coin’s ICO was fleeting, leaving many investors wishing for a second chance. BTFD Coin: The New Meme Coin Set to Shine If Mog Coin was the cosy cat curled up by the fireplace, BTFD Coin is the daring bull charging into the snowstorm. BTFD Coin embodies the popular crypto mantra “Buy The Dip”, urging investors to see market downturns as opportunities, not setbacks. It’s a meme coin designed for those who believe in growth and resilience—a mindset that resonates well with Scandinavians who know how to weather life’s storms. BTFD Coin is more than just a cheeky name; it’s a full-fledged ecosystem designed for investors who want fun and functionality: Staking Rewards: Offering a staggering 90% average APY, BTFD Coin lets you grow your investment over time without lifting a finger. P2E Gaming: Its innovative play-to-earn game combines entertainment with tangible rewards, making it a hit for crypto gamers and casual players alike. Community Power: Led by the charismatic Bulls Squad , the project has fostered a vibrant community culture where every holder feels like a key player. Ethereum’s Strength: Built on the Ethereum blockchain, BTFD Coin benefits from top-tier security and scalability, ensuring its long-term success. Plus, BTFD Coin’s presale is turning heads. Now in its 7th stage, the token is priced at $0.000064 per coin, with over $1 million raised and 23 billion tokens sold. It has already attracted 2,400+ holders, proving that this is no ordinary meme coin—it’s a movement. Investment Example: What Could $60,000 Do for You? At the current price of $0.000064, you’d receive 937,500,000 tokens. If the coin hits its projected post-launch price of $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to an impressive $562,500. That’s enough to fund a dreamy trip across all of Scandinavia—or invest further for long-term gains! The Bottom Line: A Bullish Nordic Opportunity Mog Coin’s ICO may have been a fleeting Nordic light, but BTFD Coin is the sunrise that promises a bright new day for meme coin enthusiasts.

BTC futures recorded nearly $500 million in net liquidations, with $420 million of those stemming from longs, or bets on higher prices. ETH futures recorded a smaller $85 million in liquidations.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is, they don't have enough funds to keep the trade open.  Over 156,000 individual traders were liquidated, and the largest single liquidation order was on crypto exchange OKX – a BTC/USD trade worth $18 million. The data shows that some 89% of all traders affected were long traders, or those that bet on higher prices.  Outside of BTC and ETH, futures tracking Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP logged a cumulative $50 million in losses — as prices reversed from a multiweek rally in both tokens that sent open interest on their futures to record highs last month.  Open interest (OI) refers to the number of active or open futures contracts at a given time.

37292537,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104125,1733469208,"Expert Unveils Possible Meaning Behind XRP 589 Figure, But There’s a Catch","A financial expert has recently spotlighted what she believes could be the most plausible explanation for the controversial 589 figure for XRP. The number 589 has become a controversial and symbolic figure in the XRP community, with speculations spanning from price predictions to hidden meanings. Recently, Linda P. Jones discussed a theory linking the figure to international currency standards.The origins of the 589 narrative date back to 2019, when it emerged as a speculative prediction that XRP's price would skyrocket to $589. Proponents suggested this rise could occur due to adoption by financial institutions, major regulatory milestones, or a broader financial reset. Although the price prediction has not materialized, the number 589 continues to provoke discussions among XRP supporters, often as a meme or cult symbol. Recently, Vet, an XRPL validator, stressed it was a mere reflection of handling challenges rather than an actual price target.The XRP International Currency Code TheoryIn her latest commentary, Jones referred to a post made by a community commentator, Sandy, discussing a possible connection to the ISO 4217 currency standard. Data confirms that the number 589 is currently unassigned on the list of globally recognized currency codes. https://twitter.com/LindaPJones/status/1864747036320444860Sandy proposed that this unassigned status could imply future alignment with an asset like XRP or Ripple’s forthcoming stablecoin, RLUSD . If this is accurate, XRP might receive a level of unprecedented regulatory and global financial recognition for a crypto asset.Further, it bears mentioning that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has persistently maintained exactly 589 accounts in his X (Twitter) following. This has fueled further speculation that Ripple might be hinting at a broader significance for the number. Sandy argued that such associations could invite legal risks, especially given Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. SEC if the 589 figure was just mere speculation. Legal issues could arise if regulatory bodies observe Ripple endorsing speculative theories for market manipulation.A Possible LoopholeHowever, the currency code theory overlooks an important detail. Notably, the ISO 4217 standard alphabetically assigns numerical codes to internationally recognized currencies, with codes like 576 for the Norwegian krone, 586 for the Pakistani rupee, and 590 for the Panamanian balboa. Logically, any currency taking the 589 slot would need to align alphabetically between Pakistan and Panama, suggesting it should start with a “P.” This complicates theories linking the number to XRP , which begins with “X,” unless Ripple introduces a currency fitting the criteria.Historical Context Around the 589 FigureFor the uninitiated, the XRP 589 figure became widely known through a combination of speculation and viral content. One infamous example was a fake screenshot from The Simpsons claiming the show predicted XRP reaching $589 by the end of a given year. Despite these explanations, the most grounded interpretations of 589 stem from Ripple’s actual ambitions. Early predictions tied the figure to Ripple’s xRapid platform. However, all these theories all have their loopholes, leading to the dismissal of the enigmatic figure.",NEUTRAL,XRP,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/06/expert-unveils-possible-meaning-behind-xrp-589-figure-but-theres-a-catch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-unveils-possible-meaning-behind-xrp-589-figure-but-theres-a-catch,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

At that time, the market “capped out at ~$70K and ~$5K respectively back then, with $BTC only now reaching that target – lesson in there,” Burniske noted.

He emphasized that “no one ever lost money” by taking profits, adding that any foregone gains during the process would amount to psychological discomfort rather than actual losses. “No one ever lost money taking profits, the foregone gains as you harvest on the way up are psychological pain only.

Burniske’s advice comes as Bitcoin has finally surpassed $100,000, setting a new all-time high of nearly $104,000. However, the BTC price has since pulled back to $95,000.

The confusion is evident in BTC's trading on Thursday, as it finally rose to six figures, tapping record highs near $103,900 before plummeting to $91,100, ultimately ending the day in UTC at approximately $97,000, data from TradingView and CoinDesk show. The trading range was so large that it engulfed all the price action since Nov. 20.  This led to the formation of a ""high wave candle,"" characterized by a small real body that shows the gap between the open and closing prices, along with large shadows (wicks) that reflect unusually wide price swings throughout the day.  It's a sign that the bulls now have less than full control, with sellers looking to reassert themselves, serving as a cautionary indicator for those looking to chase the market at this moment. This cautionary signal becomes even more significant given that the pattern has appeared at record highs, representing a failure to maintain gains above the closely-watched $100,000 mark.  ""The long upper shadows mean that sometime after the session's open, buying pressure thrust the security's price to an extended high. During the same session, selling pressure drove the price to a protracted low. Yet, by the session's close, the price returned almost to the opening price. That's confusion,"" CMT's explainer for high-wave candles says.  The high wave candle gets its name because Japanese traders liken the extended shadows, or wicks, to large ocean waves.  The high wave candle, coupled with the bearish divergence of the relative strength index, a momentum indicator, points to consolidation or a temporary bearish shift in the market trend. A bearish divergence occurs when the momentum oscillator sich as the RSI doesn't confirm the new high in prices.   The message is consistent with several analysts expressing concerns about overcrowding in long positions and the potential for price pullbacks.  Moreover, directional plays become challenging while prices remain locked within Thursday's range, indicating ongoing market confusion. If it breaks below the range, more sellers may enter the market. Conversely, a move above Thursday's high would suggest a resumption of the bullish trend.  Notably, Deribit-listed BTC calls expiring at the end of December now trade at a three volatility premium over puts, down from the five or higher seen on Thursday, according to data source Amberdata.

If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/robot-musk-muskrobo-solana-memecoin-to-rally14000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shib-bonk-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37278157,https://crypto.news/?p=14316736,1733468429,Can Meteora kill Pump.fun with its stealth token launch?,"Meteora has introduced M3M3 — pronounced “meme” — a new project looking to change the way meme coins operate by presenting staking incentives for investors. However, some analysts are concerned about its operating mechanism. The platform facilitated the launch of the M3M3 token to serve as a test run for this concept, with the token quickly gaining traction among the crypto community. Understanding the M3M3 platform M3M3 is Meteora’s attempt to address the challenges in the meme coin market, where the majority of tokens fail to sustain long-term value. Data confirms the grim state of meme coins, as out of 1.2 million new tokens launched last month on pump.fun, only 1.4% migrated to decentralized exchanges, and a mere 0.05% surpassed a $1 million market capitalization. This is largely due to the high rate of rug pulls. Earlier in the year, a crypto.news report confirmed that deployers of Solana-based meme coins facilitated rugpulls, leading to a combined loss of $26 million for investors in March. Most recently, the Hawk Tuah token collapsed 90% hours after launch amid rug pull allegations. https://twitter.com/bubblemaps/status/1864439521523196046 Meteora looks to address these issues by promoting a player-versus-platform (PPP) model for meme coins. This would represent a shift from a player-versus-player (PvP) environment, where quick liquidity withdrawals often leave holders at a loss. The new PPP model will introduce a staking approach, according to the announcement. This staking mechanism essentially encourages token holders to stake their assets, reducing selling pressure and fostering long-term stability. https://twitter.com/MeteoraAG/status/1864360456946954646 How the M3M3 staking model works The M3M3 system incentivizes staking by presenting rewards derived from locked liquidity swap fees. These fees are distributed among the top stakers in the form of Solana ( SOL ) tokens, which can be claimed immediately, and meme coin rewards that are automatically restaked. The model potentially creates a positive feedback loop: as more participants stake, the competition increases, driving token purchases and enhancing liquidity, which in turn generates more rewards. Unstaking comes with conditions, as participants must wait a designated period before withdrawing tokens. This mechanism discourages short-term speculation and promotes sustained participation. A saturated market Meanwhile, M3M3 enters a crowded market of token deployment platforms, including Pump.fun, SunPump, and Snek.fun. PancakeSwap also recently launched Springboard on BNB Chain. Each competitor has carved out a niche by facilitating meme coin launches and liquidity generation. For instance, Pump.fun focuses on hype-driven token launches, while SunPump leverages on-chain buyback and burn mechanisms. Meanwhile, Springboard allows free token launches. However, M3M3’s introduction of staking rewards could set it apart by addressing the issue of value retention. By comparison, M3M3 leverages a staking mechanism inspired by the “(3,3)” model to create a sustainable ecosystem. Possible strengths and drawbacks The M3M3 model has several advantages. First, it incentivizes token holders to stake rather than sell, reducing market volatility. Second, it reportedly provides a steady income stream through fee rewards, even during market downturns the official website claims. Also, its configurability makes it attractive to launchpads seeking staking solutions for new projects. However, the platform is not without challenges. Its reliance on staking to sustain demand may falter if rewards become insufficient to attract participants. The potential for high entry barriers, as only top stakers benefit significantly, could alienate smaller investors. You might also like: 62% of Solana’s DEX transactions belong to Pump.fun — What keeps it going? M3M3 token launch Meteora launched the M3M3 token as a test for the platform. Within hours of its release, the token has skyrocketed by over 962,000%, now boasting a $116 million market capitalization, per market data . Its rapid success prompted a major cryptocurrency exchange, MEXC, to list the token shortly after its debut. https://twitter.com/MEXC_Listings/status/1864598998696513742 Meteora distributed M3M3 tokens via an airdrop to active users of its platform. Despite its success, the launch sparked debate, with critics alleging insider control and expressing concerns over the lack of transparency. Community reactions The M3M3 launch has triggered mixed reactions, with opinions ranging from commendation to harsh criticism. DeFi project CC2 Ventures highlighted the generosity of Meteora’s airdrop strategy, which rewarded active users with M3M3 tokens. They noted that the tokens held significant value, thanks to the token’s rapid rise to over $113 million in market capitalization. https://twitter.com/CC2Ventures/status/1864410445639045403 Lemon, another pundit on X, praised the staking model, comparing it to game-changing DeFi innovations of the past. Lemon noted the platform’s ability to allow token holders to earn rewards without needing to sell their assets, describing it as a new frontier for meme coins. M3M3 is actually fucking genius. Game-changing launch here which imo could have a similar impact to PF with its ingenuity. $M3M3 protocol is the first mover in the space to allow users to earn from their memecoins. Any token on their platform will have the ability to stake and… https://t.co/5FDhh0kBlI — lemon (@lemondontfloss) December 4, 2024 However, not everyone viewed the launch favorably. A commentator expressed disappointment that the launch did not utilize Jupiter Exchange’s established launchpad, which might have ensured greater transparency. https://twitter.com/NftDavido/status/1864363625948864635 These critics argue that Meteora’s decision to stealth-launch the token undermined trust and gave an unfair advantage to a select few. Meanwhile, some skeptics dismissed the project entirely, suggesting it was overhyped and risky. An observer discussed the unexpected “insider-driven” nature of the launch, cautioning investors to avoid risking their SOL tokens on what they deemed an uncertain proposition. lol @MeteoraAG with a scam insider token launch and was not on my bingo card for today. $m3m3 Don’t throw away your sol!

37278120,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=658088,1733468415,Is Bitcoin’s $100K Just the Beginning? Key Insights from Supply Distribution Data,"Bitcoin has reached a landmark moment in its history earlier today, crossing the $100,000 price mark for the first time and cementing its position once again as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. As it stands, BTC all-time high is at roughly $103,679. This significant achievement has prompted a detailed analysis of its supply distribution, offering valuable insights into the behavior of long-term and short-term holders and the broader implications for the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Silent Whales: Rising Exchange Inflows Hint at Market’s Next Big Move Supply Distribution and Market Behaviour Amid the excitement of Bitcoin’s new all-time high, an analysis from CryptoQuant’s analyst, Crazzyblockk, sheds light on how this milestone impacts the cryptocurrency’s realized cap and the broader market structure. While the milestone reflects growing global adoption and investment confidence, it also raises questions about the potential trajectory of the market. According to the analysis, Bitcoin’s supply is currently divided between two key groups of holders: long-term holders (LTHs) and short-term holders (STHs). CryptoQuant data reveals that out of Bitcoin’s total supply, over 14.5 million BTC are held by LTHs, while nearly 5 million BTC are in the hands of STHs. Despite the price surge, only 52% of Bitcoin’s realized cap is attributed to STHs, a stark contrast to previous market peaks where this figure typically exceeded 80%. Historically, Bitcoin’s realized cap trends reveal distinct behaviors during market cycles. During bear market phases, most realized cap shifts towards LTHs as accumulation intensifies, signaling the end of the bearish trend. Conversely, during bull market peaks, the realized cap tends to be dominated by STHs, driven by speculative trading and short-term profits. However, the current distribution shows a higher concentration among LTHs, indicating a deviation from traditional market patterns. Implications for Bitcoin’s Market Momentum According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the relatively low realized cap held by STHs in the current market cycle suggests reduced selling pressure, which may support sustained price growth. The analyst revealed that with a significant proportion of Bitcoin held by LTHs, market confidence appears strong, potentially providing a buffer against abrupt price corrections. This stability is crucial as it reflects long-term investor trust and reduces the likelihood of speculative volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Move? Coinbase Premium Suggests a Short-Term Rally May Be Brewing In addition, the analysis also highlights that this supply distribution aligns with a long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin. The reduced participation of STHs in the realized cap indicates room for further upward movement as more capital may enter the market without triggering a significant sell-off. The analyst wrote: In conclusion, Bitcoin reaching $100,000 is a historic achievement, but the current supply dynamics suggest the potential for further upward movement, given the stability provided by LTHs and the relatively low participation of STHs in the realized cap.

As a result, the cryptocurrency exchange has a balance of 39.7k Bitcoins, worth about $3.8 billion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin Price Dropped Below $100K? , Mt.Gox Payouts on the Horizon Since the defunct cryptocurrency exchange extended its deadline for paying creditors from October 31, 2024, to October 31, 2025, several internal Bitcoin transfers have been observed. In July this year, Mt.Gox made the first fund distribution of about $7 billion through different cryptocurrency exchanges including Kraken . With the heightened Bitcoin transfers in the past two months, Mt.Gox liquidators are possibly preparing to distribute the remaining funds to distressed creditors. Furthermore, Mt.Gox creditors have had to wait from 2014 until recently for their refund to be processed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As a result, the underlying price action is less likely to be impacted by the Mt.Gox repayments. Nonetheless, the finalization of Mt.Gox repayments will be a major closure of the largest and oldest crypto heist in history. Consequently, the development of new crypto projects will heavily borrow from the mistakes of Mt.Gox to improve their respective security to ensure a seamless mainstream adoption. FAQs How will Mt. Gox affect Bitcoin? Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin payouts won’t significantly impact Bitcoin’s price due to high institutional liquidity and widespread adoption. How much Bitcoin was lost in the Mt. Gox crash? Mt. Gox lost around 850,000 BTC during the 2014 crash, one of the largest heists in cryptocurrency history. Did Mt. Gox shift almost $9 billion worth of BTC? Yes, Mt.

Support at $96,000 and resistance near $104,000 could shape Bitcoin’s price moves. BTC’s price in December 2024 may fluctuate between $95,440 and $107,264. Bitcoin’s breach of the $100K mark reaped substantial gains to early investors, but then it also raises concerns for those considering entering the market now. In fact, as Bitcoin reaches new price highs, skeptics like Peter Schiff warn of the potential risks for future buyers. Back in 2019, Schiff dismissed the idea of Bitcoin ever reaching $100,000—a claim that now seems misplaced, as the cryptocurrency even traded over $101,000 for a brief period. While those selling #Bitcoin are cashing out with huge gains, the windfall comes at the expense of buyers left holding the bag. The larger loss will be to society as a whole, as a result of all the capital wasted on this nonsense, that otherwise could have been used productively. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 5, 2024 Bitcoin’s Surge and the Market Sentiment Bitcoin’s rapid rise goes beyond just price; it reflects a broader shift in market sentiment.

37277567,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389912,1733467285,Ripple vs. SEC Update : January 2025 Could Be a Turning Point For XRP Lawsuit,"The post Ripple vs. SEC Update : January 2025 Could Be a Turning Point For XRP Lawsuit appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After Bitcoin’s $100K fakeout rally , the market is again back to the previous level, though the current dips are part of Bitcoin’s bull cycle. There is constant pressure building up in the crypto space, all due to the recent Trump actions. While the market is rejoicing in his pro-crypto administration choices, there is a fear rolling too. With the deadline for the U.S. SEC’s appeal in the Ripple lawsuit set for January 15, 2025, the crypto world is eagerly waiting to see what comes next. As per the rumors, the SEC may not bow down to the ongoing crypto cases as predicted. Will the SEC Seek an Extension? In light of the current scenario, Legal experts are divided on whether the SEC will appeal the ruling or seek an extension in the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit . Attorney Jeremy Hogan suggested that the SEC could request a 30-day extension to explain its delay in filing the appeal, citing the leadership changes at the SEC. Hogan believes both Ripple and the court may be open to allowing this delay, which could give both parties more time to assess the situation. Moreover, the change in leadership at the SEC could also impact the lawsuit’s direction. Paul Atkins, the new SEC Chair , is known for his more balanced and clearer stance on cryptocurrency regulation. Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner, could bring a more favorable regulatory approach for Ripple and the broader crypto industry. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed support for Atkins, calling him an “outstanding choice” and emphasizing the need for common-sense regulation. However, keeping the community spirit alive Garlinghouse said that Atkins’ leadership could end the “prohibition era” for cryptocurrencies. Amid the Ripple vs SEC drama, the crypto world is on edge—read the XRP price prediction to see where this legal battle could take the token next! Concerns About the SEC’s Future Approach Despite this optimism, some, like legal expert Bill Morgan, remain cautious. Morgan has expressed concerns about the future direction of the SEC, especially since Jorge Tenreiro, who has been heavily involved in the Ripple case, will likely sign the SEC’s brief in the appeal. Morgan worries that even with new leadership, Tenreiro’s influence could keep the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation the same. On a similar tone, Eleanor Terrett also points out that it will be interesting to see if Paul Atkins, will follow Gary Gensler’s lead. When Gensler became SEC chair in 2021, he shook things up by replacing all the members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), even though they were meant to serve staggered five-year terms. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37279027,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51496,1733466735,Bitcoin Maximalist Says This XRP Rally Will Be the Mother of Rug Pulls. Here’s why,"Bitcoin maximalists and critics of XRP have raised concerns about the cryptocurrency’s recent meteoric rise, predicting that it could culminate in a catastrophic collapse, with some labeling it the “mother of all rugpulls.” Skepticism from Bitcoin Advocates XRP has surged significantly in recent months, recording a 283% increase in November and an additional 31% within the first three days of December. This impressive rally, however, has drawn criticism from Bitcoin proponents, who view it as unsustainable. A prominent Bitcoin advocate, known as “BitMan,” shared his doubts by highlighting XRP’s overall price history. According to BitMan, the cryptocurrency has achieved a remarkable 45,920% gain since its inception, with its recent performance suggesting an unnatural trajectory. He warned that XRP’s ongoing rally could end disastrously. Similarly, Rajat Soni, a Chartered Financial Analyst and Bitcoin maximalist, voiced skepticism over XRP’s price movements. In a post on X, Soni questioned how XRP could rise by 435% since November 2, given that it had only increased by 11% over the preceding five years. He described this pattern as irregular and suggested it might indicate a pump-and-dump scheme. Soni’s comments drew mixed reactions. A market analyst and cryptocurrency commentator known as “Kaptain Kirk” countered these claims, attributing XRP’s recent growth to a market correction following prolonged price suppression caused by the SEC lawsuit. According to Kirk, XRP’s rise represents its return to fair market value rather than manipulation. XRP Outperforms Bitcoin XRP’s performance relative to Bitcoin has been another focal point of criticism. The XRP/BTC trading pair saw a 179.14% increase in November, followed by a further 32% rise in December. By December 3, it had reached 0.00002704 BTC, marking an 18-month high. This outperformance has further fueled skepticism from Bitcoin maximalists, who argue that XRP’s gains stem from speculative trading rather than fundamental value. Critics contend that such volatility undermines XRP’s legitimacy as a stable investment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, proponents of XRP have pushed back, highlighting its resilience and historical standing within the cryptocurrency market. Tony Edward, host of the Thinking Crypto podcast, emphasized that XRP has remained among the top 10 cryptocurrencies for years, even amid market fluctuations. Edward dismissed concerns about a potential rug pull, pointing out that Bitcoin undergoes significant price corrections during bear markets. Edward also accused Bitcoin maximalists of bias, suggesting they struggle to accept when altcoins outperform Bitcoin. He argued that XRP’s rally reflects increasing confidence in the token, particularly as expectations grow for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Diverging Opinions on XRP’s Future The debate surrounding XRP’s recent surge highlights the contrasting perspectives within the cryptocurrency community. Supporters view the rally as a long-overdue correction following years of legal challenges and market suppression, while critics caution that the rapid rise may signal instability. As XRP continues to gain traction, its supporters remain optimistic about its prospects, pointing to its strong market performance and increasing institutional interest. Meanwhile, detractors, particularly Bitcoin maximalists, remain wary, predicting a sharp downturn that could result in significant losses.

While BTC reclaimed some losses, JasmyCoin (JASMY) stole the spotlight with a remarkable 36% surge. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) emerged as the top gainer among major cryptocurrencies, rising 6%, as market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin holds steady after sharp drop Bitcoin experienced a dramatic dip earlier in the day, touching a 24-hour low of $91,998 after briefly surpassing the $103,000 mark . At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $97,541, reflecting a 4% drop over the past 24 hours. Despite the downturn, Bitcoin remains up 33% over the past month, maintaining its market cap at $1.93 trillion. The dip triggered over $649 million in liquidations, signaling heightened market volatility. Institutional activity also made headlines, with Fidelity acquiring $47 million in BTC, while Grayscale sold $148 million in GBTC shares but added $95 million worth of BTC ETFs. Ethereum edges up despite market swings Ethereum (ETH) managed to buck the broader trend, posting a 1% gain over the past 24 hours. Trading at $3,859, ETH recorded a daily high of $3,956 and a low of $3,683. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap boasts a valuation of $465 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $57 billion. Solana and XRP Solana (SOL) emerged as a standout performer, climbing 6% to trade at $241. Its market cap stands at $228 billion, supported by a trading volume of $9.41 billion in the last 24 hours. SOL’s bullish momentum has solidified its position as one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. In contrast, XRP experienced a minor setback, trading at $2.30 with a 2% decline in the last 24 hours. Despite the dip, its market cap remains robust at $131 billion, supported by a trading volume of $17 billion. JasmyCoin sees 36% surge JasmyCoin (JASMY) was the day’s top performer, skyrocketing 36% to trade at $0.05225.

However, smaller meme coins like PEPE and Bonk managed to eke out gains of 1% to 4%, offering a glimmer of positivity in the segment. Top losers: IOTA, Algorand, and VeChain On the downside, IOTA and Algorand (ALGO) shed 9% and 8%, respectively, while VeChain (VET) lost 7%.

37279025,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51492,1733466647,Solana Rallies As Ripple Takes a Dip While This New Crypto Presale Catches Investor Attention,"As the crypto arena evolves, Solana and Ripple have managed to maintain their reputations for speed and scalability, but they appear to be moving in different directions. Solana (SOL) introduced ZK compression technology this year, which has given it a positive price outlook going into 2025, while Ripple (XRP) saw major gains in the last month but may be heading for a big correction. Meanwhile, Lunex Network ($LNEX) is making waves with its unmatched interoperability, positioning itself as a potential game-changer in the crypto world. As this rising protocol continues to gain traction, could Lunex Network surpass its more established counterparts? Solana (SOL) Introduces New Scaling Solution Solana (SOL) has churned out some amazing technological developments this year. One example is the “SOON” layer-2 scaling solution for accelerating transactions and lowering costs on the Solana network. Additionally, the success of projects like Solayer, which recently secured $12 million in funding, is helping to broaden Solana’s presence in the DeFi ecosystem. These advancements are addressing scalability challenges, sparking optimism among developers and investors about Solana’s future. On the market front, Solana has had a good year, and has largely recovered from its dip in 2022. Solana (SOL) has rallied in the last month, leaving holders optimistic. Ripple (XRP) Takes A Dip Despite Ledger Enhancements Ripple (XRP) had a wild year with huge increases following Trump’s appointment. Ripple developers have been coding away while building out the Ripple ledger. One of the biggest updates is the new native smart contract functionality which has been added to the Ripple (XRP) Ledger through the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) sidechain integration. This innovation lets developers run Ethereum-compatible smart contracts on XRP to increase interoperability with more than 55 blockchains and improve programmability of the protocol. But even with these improvements, some analysts now think Ripple (XRP) is poised for a major corrective action and could plummet as 2024 ends and 2025 begins. Lunex Network Combines Efficiency and Interoperability Low gas fees and a suite of features are driving Lunex Network ($LNEX) into the center of the DeFi space. Built on advanced smart contract technology, the platform enables seamless trading across over 50,000 assets, making it a godsend for investors looking for speed and cost-effectiveness. A unique selling point for Lunex Network is its revenue-sharing model. Essentially, it pays token holders 18% of the platform’s annual profits. Such an approach allows long-term investment and creates a sustainable ecosystem where users are rewarded directly as the network grows. Coupled with a capped supply of 8 billion tokens and a deflationary mechanism, $LNEX incentivizes early adoption and promotes value appreciation over time. A robust portfolio tracker and a mobile exchange app are also available for traders managing multiple portfolios or who like to trade on the move. Unlike most standard tools, the portfolio tracker also has functionality to monitor ETFs, stocks, cryptocurrencies and other financial assets from one place, which is handy for multifaceted traders. Lunex Network Attracts Investors in Droves Investors are clamoring to grab up $LNEX tokens at a price of just $0.0038. Analysts believe $LNEX will rise 2000% through 2024, making it an attractive play for those seeking big gains. For savvy traders wanting to be a part of a high-potential project, Lunex Network ($LNEX) is hard to pass up on.

As aelf has been providing four years of secure and stable mainnet operations since 2020, this halving milestone highlights the network’s maturity and marks a pivotal step in aelf’s journey toward sustainable and innovative blockchain growth. “aelf’s halving event is more than just a reduction in block rewards. It represents our continued evolution as a sustainable and innovative blockchain ecosystem. Beyond establishing a resilient economic framework, it symbolises our transformative step toward advancing AI blockchain initiatives, inspiring engagement, innovation, and growth across the aelf ecosystem and beyond,” shared Brian Liang, COO of aelf. Impact of aelf’s Halving Event In line with aelf’s foundational vision and whitepaper, the blockchain network allocates 12% of the total ELF tokens to block rewards. Governed by aelf’s AEDPoS consensus mechanism, aelf’s halving occurs every four years, reducing block rewards by half to gradually decrease token issuance. Since 2020, aelf blockchain rewards have been set at 0.125 ELF. Post-halving, they will be reduced to 0.0625 ELF. The decrease in block rewards aims to foster long-term value creation and sustain aelf’s tokenomics model to benefit current and future stakeholders. Due to the change in block rewards, the halving encourages block production nodes to focus more on network efficiency and innovation. For ELF token holders, the halving, a form of controlled token issuance, helps them preserve the token value as a more resilient economic framework is being built within the aelf blockchain ecosystem. aelf’s Path Forward A reflection of aelf’s longevity in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape, this halving also marks a new phase for aelf where innovation, collaboration, and AI integration converge to drive the blockchain forward.

However, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres still fined the company with $125 million due to violating institutional sales. Later, in October 2024, the commission went against the court’s decision by seeking further review for the classification of XRP. This case affected not only the company but also the crypto industry. After Paul Atkins’s announcement as the chairman of the SEC, Ripple’s executive praised Trump’s decision . Brad Garlinghouse mentioned it as “an outstanding choice” as he hopes it will be the end of the crypto prohibition era.

37276982,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389888,1733466187,Pudgy Penguins NFT Sees 34.3% Surge as NFT Market Rebounds,"The post Pudgy Penguins NFT Sees 34.3% Surge as NFT Market Rebounds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Until last week, the NFT community had been in a state of confusion due to the inability of the sector to match the performance of the crypto, which has shown massive growth since November 5 – the US presidential election. At first, the relief for the community came in the form of a post by OpenSea last week, saying “NFTs are back.” The impressive weekly performance of the top NFT collections proves that the post was not a mere gimmick to calm down the impatient community. Pudgy Penguins’ Record Price Surge In the last 24 hours, the NFT market has seen a surge of 2.0% in market cap and 37.2% in trading volume, implying that the trend is largely favourable. In the last seven days, almost all top NFT collections have performed impressively. Nonetheless, the notable performance is the one demonstrated by Pudgy Penguins, which has displayed a rise of 34.3%. The price of this Ethereum-based NFT collection currently stands at $67,621 (17.35 ETH). Growth of Other Major NFT Collections CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Pudgy Penguins, Infinex Patrons, and Mutant Ape Yacht Club are the top five NFT collections by market cap at this juncture; interestingly, all of them are Ethereum-based collections and have shown growth last week. Mutant Ape Yacht Club, with a 7-day change of +57.5%, becomes the top performer of the week. Pudgy Penguins closely follows with a 7-day change of +34.3%. Meanwhile, the top two NFT collections by market cap, CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, display +10.3% and +32.0%, respectively. What makes Pudgy Penguins different is the fact that in the last 24 hours, with its 15.7% increase, it has outperformed all the other top NFT collections. The Revival Story of Pudgy Penguins Pudgy Penguins is a popular brand, which produces content, merchandise, toys, and digital collectibles. It was after it was acquired by Luca Netz that its destiny turned around. After the acquisition, the brand expanded its retail presence, reaching strategic partnerships with industry giants like Walmart and Target. Expanding its business portfolio, it entered the lucrative sector of NFT gaming. Currently, the company is run by a team of experienced professionals, including Luca Netz, Lorenzo Melendez, Austin, Peter Lobanov, Jennifer Mcglone, and Vedant. Predictions for Pudgy Penguins A few months ago, while speaking on a podcast, named WSH Podcast, Luca Netz asserted that the Pudgy Penguins price would reach at least 200 ETH before the end of this crypto bull cycle. This sounds a bit of an exaggeration, considering that, to achieve the target predicted by Netz, the collection must show at least 12x growth. The current price of the NFT remains at least 16.39% lower than its mid-February peak of 21.29 ETH, indicating that there is more room for growth. NFT Trading Volume Doubles: An Overview The NFT sales volume has reached $194,703,180, marking a 36.94% rise in the last 7 days; in the last 24 hours alone, it has climbed by 50.66%. Reports say that top collections have accounted for over 40% of the total trading volume in the sector. In the last seven days, the trading volume of Pudgy Penguins has recorded a massive increase of 274.08%, outperforming CryptoPunks (150.47%). However, not many find the surge in the NFT market impressive. What bothers them is that the current overall trading volume is far less exciting when compared to the market performance of late 2021 and early 2022.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pudgy-penguins-nft-sees-34-3-surge-as-nft-market-rebounds/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

AUSTRAC said the task force aims to ensure digital currency exchanges (DCEs) offering crypto ATM services meet minimum standards. The initiative seeks to enforce strong practices to prevent these machines from being used for scams, fraud or criminal transactions. Under the AML/CTF Act 2006, DCEs, including crypto ATM providers, must register with AUSTRAC. Additionally, they are required to monitor transactions, verify customer identities (KYC), report suspicious activities (SMRs) and file threshold transaction reports for cash transactions of $10,000 or more.

We will be focusing on this industry over the course of next year.” AUSTRAC has registered about 400 digital currency exchange providers so far. Among these, only a few operate crypto ATMs. Yet Australia boasts around 1200 such machines, ranking third globally in terms of quantity. AUSTRAC and ASIC Take Steps to Secure Australia’s Growing Crypto Ecosystem Cryptocurrency adoption is rising quickly in Australia, with an estimated 31.6% of Australians having held or currently holding cryptocurrencies, including many owning NFTs. Australian regulator ASIC has introduced new licensing rules requiring crypto exchanges managing significant client assets to obtain an AFSL, aiming to strengthen consumer protection. This week, ASIC invited public feedback on updates to its digital asset guidelines to clarify how the Corporations Act 2001 applies to digital assets and guide related financial services entities. Earlier this year, Australian authorities uncovered a massive crypto scam targeting locals, affecting over 2,000 digital wallets .

Despite being up by more than 15 percent in the last seven days, ADA is currently showing no signs of bullish momentum. To start, let’s take a look at the broader picture for ADA. Short-Term Focus: Right now, the focus is on higher prices, with the potential for a pullback into the orange support region between $0.64 and $0.94. This could offer an opportunity for those looking to enter at better levels. On the smaller time frames, the analyst shared potential upside extensions, but if the price breaks below the support range between $1.11 and $1.21, it could signal a larger wave four pullback. If the price falls below $1.05, that would invalidate this structure. The target levels to watch for are around $1.42, $1.72, $2.36, and possibly even $2.95 in a euphoric phase. However, these targets depend on the price action during the next pullback. Bitcoin’s Influence: Bitcoin’s dominance has increased a bit, and for now, the focus is back on Bitcoin. However, altcoins like ADA aren’t necessarily suffering; they are just moving sideways. This pullback is still part of the overall setup, so higher prices are still in play. Key Resistance and Breakout Signals: If ADA breaks above the recent high around $1.25, it could signal an upside breakout. The more significant signal will come with a break above the yellow wave 1 high at $1.32 or $1.33, but the analyst said that ADA is not quite there yet. Near-Term Price Targets: If the third wave is unfolding, the price could hit the $1.42 level next. If the microstructure remains valid, we could see higher targets around $1.49 or $1.55.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardano-price-prediction-today-breakout-of-breakdown/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37276420,https://coinpaper.com/6402/controversial-sotheby-s-vp-back-with-new-solana-meme-coin,1733465112,Controversial Sotheby’s VP Back with New Solana Meme Coin,"Both VOID and HAWK are facing scrutiny over insider trading allegations. Meanwhile, Binance.US listed the popular meme coin PEPE. This could be attributed to the growing acceptance of meme coins, which now has a collective market cap exceeding $140 billion. On a philanthropic note, the DOGS meme coin launched a charity portal, and pledged impressive donations to nonprofits and animal welfare. New Solana Meme Coin Raises Eyebrows Michael Bouhanna, a vice president at Sotheby’s auction house, again made waves in the crypto world with the launch of a second Solana-based meme coin. On Dec. 4, Bouhanna teased the release of his latest art-themed meme coin, Nothing (VOID), on his social media account. Shortly after, a wallet associated with him minted the VOID token. The launch led to a very lucrative trading event where one trader purchased 462 million VOID tokens for close to $8,200 worth of Solana (SOL) and sold 439 million of them just 30 minutes later for over $1 million. This isn’t Bouhanna’s first venture into the meme coin space. Earlier, he created another token called Comedian (BAN) , that is inspired by the viral $6-million banana artwork that was famously purchased by Tron founder Justin Sun. However, the BAN token’s launch became controversial after allegations of insider trading emerged. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain accused Bouhanna of making $1 million in profits through insider wallets associated with the BAN token. According to the firm, Bouhanna previouslyinvested in other meme coins with limited success, suggesting that the launch of BAN was motivated by a desire to profit from the hype. Bouhanna denied the allegations , and argued that the wallet in question does not belong to him and that the reported profits were largely unrealized. He described the creation of BAN as a personal hobby with no connection to his role at Sotheby’s. Bouhanna also clarified that he initially intended to launch the token anonymously to avoid any association with his professional profile. However, the community quickly linked the project to him, and created a narrative that BAN was affiliated with Sotheby’s. Bouhanna then claimed this narrative was used to promote the token without his consent. The community’s reaction to Bouhanna’s involvement in meme coins has been mixed. While some applauded his creativity, others criticized his actions and questioned the ethics of launching such tokens. Some users tagged Sotheby’s , and asked whether the auction house condoned these kinds of activities by its executives. Hawk Tuah Meme Coin Sparks Outrage Another meme coin also recently faced some controversy. The launch of Haliey Welch’s Hawk Tuah (HAWK) meme coin ignited widespread outrage across social media after a dramatic pump-and-dump scenario that unfolded shortly after its release. The crypto was launched at 10:00 pm UTC on Dec. 4, and the token quickly reached a peak market cap of $490 million before crashing by 91% in just three hours. On-chain analysis from Bubblemaps and Dexscreener revealed that between 80% and 90% of the HAWK token supply at launch was controlled by a combination of insider wallets and snipers. These entities very quickly bought large portions of the token’s supply during its early trading moments. Solana block explorer Solscanner pointed out a specific wallet that sniped 17.5% of the token’s supply for 4,195 Wrapped Solana (WSOL), valued at $993,000 at the time. Over the next 90 minutes, the wallet sold 135.8 million HAWK tokens, netting a profit of $1.3 million. In a Dec. 5 X post, Welch denied allegations of insider activity or any distribution of free tokens to influencers. She stated that the team did not sell any tokens and took measures to try and reduce sniper risks by launching on the decentralized liquidity protocol Meteora, which included high fees at the start of the launch. Despite these claims, the big price decline and the dominance of snipers and insiders in the token’s early supply fueled skepticism. The fallout from the HAWK token’s price crash has been quite severe, and several users reported major losses. One user on X shared that they lost $43,000 after investing in the token, while another reportedly swapped $1.4 million worth of MOODENG into HAWK and lost $1.3 million in the process. Some people suggest that Welch and her team may face legal repercussions as a result of the controversial token launch. Multiple users on X even claimed to file complaints with the SEC, and law firms started soliciting the affected investors. Burwick Law invited those who lost money on HAWK to contact them to explore their legal rights. Binance.US Lists PEPE On the other hand, things are going much better for other meme coins. Binance.US recently announced the listing of the popular meme coin Pepe (PEPE). The listing allows users to trade it against Tether (USDT) starting Dec. 5. Data from CoinMarketCap indicated that PEPE has a market cap of over $9 billion. PEPE’s all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The listing is part of a broader trend among crypto exchanges which are increasing their offerings of meme coins. This movement gained a lot of momentum after the election of crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump. Coinbase, for example, recently listed meme coins like Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF), while Binance.US added Bonk (BONK) to its roster in November. Meme coins collectively boast a market cap of more than $140 billion. The rise of meme coins sparked mixed reactions from the crypto community. Supporters like Murad Mahmudov argue that meme coins provide a legitimate use case for cryptocurrencies by reducing speculation premiums on altcoins. Critics, including Jimmy Song , view meme coins as overly speculative and detrimental to investors. Pepe is a cartoon frog that was created by artist Matt Furie in 2005. Since then, it has become a cultural phenomenon and a key symbol in the crypto space. Its popularity extends beyond just PEPE to other meme coins inspired by Furie’s work, like Brett (BRETT), Andy (ANDY), and Landwolf (WOLF). DOGS Launches Charity Portal The DOGS meme coin announced plans to donate more than 6 billion tokens, which are valued at almost $4.5 million, to nonprofit organizations worldwide. This announcement was made after the launch of a charity portal in late November that allowed registered nonprofits to apply for funding. DOGS plans to redirect unclaimed airdrop tokens to support charitable causes. As part of its charitable efforts, DOGS partnered with Best Friends Animal Society, and committed $150,000 to help care for homeless animals in the United States. This collaboration fits in perfectly with DOGS’ mission to support shelters in achieving a 90% no-kill rate by 2025. DOGS founder Andrew refered to the partnership as a call to action for the crypto community. Through this initiative, DOGS will fund one month of care for adopted dogs, with its mascot, Spotty, serving as an ambassador in events and promotional campaigns. The DOGS token was inspired by Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov’s iconic dog drawing. It symbolizes Digital Resistance and reflects TON’s rebranding after Durov’s arrest in France earlier this year. The dog symbol dates back to 2011 when Durov resisted demands to censor liberal and dissident voices in Russia. DOGS launched an airdrop in September, and quickly reached 17 million users . One of the main goals of the airdrop was to increase crypto awareness on Telegram and promote animal welfare by using the DOGS Mini App, which has over 53 million users. Despite its initial success, DOGS has faced a 50+% decline in value.

As of Thursday, JASMY broke out of a seven-month consolidation phase, climbing to $0.054. The Altcoin Outperforming Major Cryptos In addition to its impressive yearly performance, JasmyCoin has seen notable gains over shorter time frames, recording increases of 118%, 162%, and 211% over the past seven, fourteen, and thirty days, respectively. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Market Cap Of $280 Trillion By 2045—What Will The Price Be? Market experts anticipate that the overall market’s bullish trend could continue at least until the second quarter of 2025, suggesting further growth potential for JASMY, which remains 98% below its all-time high of $4.79, reached during the 2021 bull market. However, with further gains expected in the coming months, potentially reaching a cycle top by October 2025, Ethereum (ETH), the second largest crypto, will play a key role as it often leads the way for further price appreciation like the altcoin in question. But, what exactly is JasmyCoin, and why has it attracted significant investment in recent weeks? JasmyCoin Eyes Key Resistance Levels JasmyCoin is the native token of the Jasmy platform, which aims to democratize data usage by integrating blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The platform provides a decentralized and secure infrastructure that allows individuals to control and monetize their personal data. Users can safely store and manage their data while granting businesses access with their consent. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this altcoin is an ERC-20 token with a total supply of 50 billion tokens. Its primary uses include data transfer and storage, payment for services, facilitating market entry for institutional investors, offering crypto loans, and optimizing tax strategies. In contrast to Bitcoin’s year-to-date gains of 120%—following its recent all-time high of $104,000—JASMY has significantly outperformed the largest digital asset. Related Reading: XRP Downtrend Is Only Temporary: Analyst Gives Reasons Why Price Is Headed For $3.2 According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin saw a trading volume increase of 64% compared to Wednesday, while JasmyCoin recorded a nearly 100% surge in trading volume during the same period. As JasmyCoin continues its upward trajectory, technical analysis reveals critical resistance levels at $0.063, $0.067, and $0.070 on its JASMY/USDT daily chart—heights not seen since January 2022. These levels could pose challenges to further price surges for the altcoin. Conversely, key support levels to monitor include $0.040, which is vital for maintaining bullish momentum, and $0.031. Holding these support levels will be crucial for the altcoin as it aims to inch closer to the $0.10 mark.

And Why Has Donald Trump Made Him Crypto Czar? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Former PayPal executive and renowned venture capitalist David O. Sacks has been appointed by Donald Trump as the White House’s first “AI & Crypto Czar.” This new role is part of Trump’s plan to position America as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency, two rapidly growing fields shaping the future. The announcement came shortly after Bitcoin reached its $100k milestone . Why Trump Appointed David Sacks Only? In a post on Truth Social, Trump announced Sacks’ appointment and highlighted his mission to create a clear legal framework for the cryptocurrency sector. However, Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks arose from his impressive track record as a tech entrepreneur and investor. Sacks, a founding-era COO of PayPal and a key member of the “PayPal Mafia,” has built and supported some of Silicon Valley’s most successful ventures. His expertise in technology and finance makes him tackle the challenges and opportunities in AI and crypto effectively. Meanwhile, some experts even hint that Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks is seen as a reward for his loyal support during the campaign. Sacks played a pivotal role in fundraising for Trump, helping to raise $12 million during a high-profile event earlier this year. What Changes Could Sacks Bring? David Sacks will focus on creating clear rules for cryptocurrencies to remove confusion and help the U.S. digital asset industry grow. His goal is to support crypto businesses and position the United States as a global leader in digital innovation. According to Trump, he will “steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship,” ensuring a balanced digital landscape that supports open discourse. Sacks will also focus on safeguarding free speech in the online space Additionally, Sacks will chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, guiding the administration’s policies on emerging technologies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : David Sacks Crypto Czar: Trump’s Visionary Choice to Shape US Tech Policy , Sacks Close Ties to Trump and Musk Sacks has been a strong Trump supporter of Trump, hosting fundraisers and rallying tech industry donors.

This move also shook the Worldcoin price, which was stuck in a tight consolidation phase as the bears restricted the trade within predetermined price levels. Meanwhile, the November breakout helped the price to rise above the range, which is now primed to rise by another 25% after securing a 25% upswing. Worldcoin is among the tokens that have failed to rise even 20% close to its yearly highs, which have already been surpassed by many. The prolonged accumulation may have attracted huge trader’s attention and as a result, the platform witnessed a massive increase in volume. With the levels hitting $2 billion from the lows below $400 million, the future prospectus of the WLD price remains extremely bullish as it has more room to grow. After facing a massive downfall, the bulls failed to trigger a strong rebound and as a result, the token remained accumulated for a long time. Meanwhile, the bulls caused some variations in between, which formed a bullish pattern later. Luckily, the recent price rise pushed the levels above the neckline of the Adam & Eve pattern and after a retest, the token has begun its journey towards higher highs. The WLD price is currently trading around $4 with over 21% in the past 24 hours and a cumulative growth of over 100% in the past 30 days. Although the price remains 65% away from its ATH at $11.82, the token demonstrates bullish performance and high volatility. Therefore, now that the price has launched a massive upswing, the next levels to watch could be around $4.4 while the pivotal resistance to achieve could be around $5.1, which may validate a rise from the bearish influence. Therefore, if the token continues to hold similar bullish momentum and reaches $5, then the probability of reaching a double-digit figure could be validated. However, this move could consume more time than expected, probably in the first few days of 2025.",POSITIVE,WLD,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | WLD,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/worldcoin-in-the-middle-of-a-50-run-to-reach-5-will-this-help-wld-price-reach-10-in-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

According to data from Farside Investors , the nine spot Ether ETFs collectively saw $431.5 million in inflows, marking the ninth consecutive trading day of net positive flows for the surging cryptocurrency. This inflow surge surpassed the previous record of $333 million set on November 29, highlighting growing investor confidence in Ether ETFs. Ethereum Funds Attract $1.3 Billion in Past Two Weeks Over the past two weeks, the funds have attracted more than $1.3 billion in inflows, cementing Ether’s position as a rallying asset in the crypto market. The influx has pushed total net inflows past $1 billion, a recovery partly attributed to the stabilization of Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which had previously been under pressure. Leading the charge was BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which reported a record-breaking $295.7 million in inflows for the day, bringing its cumulative total to $2.3 billion. Other prominent players also saw significant contributions. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) added $113.6 million, while Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) and Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF (ETHW) recorded inflows of $30.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively. However, Grayscale’s larger Ethereum Trust (ETHE) registered an outflow of $15.1 million, with no notable activity from the remaining funds. In comparison, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. also reported strong momentum, with 11 funds collectively netting $747.8 million in inflows on December 5. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated, contributing $751.6 million, offsetting the $148.8 million outflow from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has now amassed nearly $34 billion in inflows since its launch. Ether’s performance has been buoyed by a 16% price increase over the past two weeks, reaching an eight-month high of $3,946 on December 5, according to CoinGecko. Analysts suggest Ether’s strength against Bitcoin, as measured by the ETH/BTC ratio, is poised to rise further in the coming months, having already increased 14.5% in the past month to reach 0.04.

The resurgence challenges the narrative of an impending “ altcoin season ,” where alternative cryptocurrencies often outshine Bitcoin. Bitcoin dominance had dropped to 54.7% on December 4, following a sharp decline from its November high of 61.8%. However, Bitcoin’s explosive move to a six-figure valuation reversed the trend, catching the crypto market off guard. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s historic surge past the $100,000 milestone has captivated the cryptocurrency market, but Sergei Gorev, Head of Risk at YouHodler, remains cautious. In a recent statement shared with Cryptonews.com, Gorev predicted that the price may see only moderate growth beyond this level before a significant correction takes hold. “The cryptocurrency market is very fond of round numbers, and the price often unfolds in such cases.” “Also note that monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual futures and options contracts are expected to expire in two weeks,” he added.

Speaking about the recent surge in Bitcoin prices, Roubini noted Bitcoin's inherent volatility and lack of fundamental utility as a medium of exchange. Roubini criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for failing to meet the basic requirements of a currency. He argued that Bitcoin is neither a scalable means of payment nor a stable store of value. “Bitcoin is not an economic unit of account, it is not a stable store of value and it is not a scalable means of payment,” he said, citing its history of extreme price swings. Drawing attention to the example of El Salvador, where Bitcoin has begun to be used as legal tender, he said that less than 1% of transactions in the country are carried out using cryptocurrency. “I don’t think Bitcoin will ever become a currency,” he added. Related News: Giant Whale Sells Last Altcoins After Market Rally, Profiting 100,000x on This Altcoin Roubini also disagreed with the claims that Bitcoin provides protection against inflation or the devaluation of fiat currencies. “Historically, Bitcoin has been highly correlated with the stock market,” Roubini said, explaining that its price tends to rise and fall with stocks rather than acting as a counterweight during periods of inflation. Unlike gold, which has traditionally been a reliable hedge during inflationary periods, he argued that Bitcoin’s performance has not been in line with such expectations. Roubini also voiced concerns about regulatory developments in the crypto space. While acknowledging that retail use is increasing, he warned that looser regulation could lead to another speculative bubble. “The risk is that we are moving towards too little regulation, which could pave the way for scams and market failures similar to what we saw with FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried,” he said. He warned that a lack of oversight could increase systemic risks in the crypto ecosystem, resulting in another bubble and bust cycle. “Many players in this space are shady and weak regulation only increases the risk of fraud and volatility,” Roubini said. *This is not investment advice.

Per CoinGecko data, Sui’s market cap is currently over $12.3 billion, which has increased sharply amid the 110% and 560% surge in SUI price over the past month and past year respectively. SUI traded at lows of $0.3648 in October 2023, which puts the current price level of $4.14 a notable 1,060% up. Analysts say Sui price could target $5 after its latest leg up. Copper adds USDC on Sui On Thursday, the Sui network hit upward momentum as a series of positive developments catalyzed bulls’ endeavors. Digital assets custody and collateral management provider Copper provided one of these positive announcements. In a blog post , Copper said it had added support for the USDC stablecoin on Sui. Circle’s USDC is a 1:1 USD redeemable stablecoin and is live on Copper’s custodial ecosystem, the company noted. Sui @SuiNetwork · Follow USDC on Sui now has the support of @CopperHQ ’s enterprise-grade custody infrastructure, adding even more momentum to Sui’s top 10 DeFi ecosystem! 9:17 pm · 5 Dec 2024 353 Reply Copy link Read 16 replies The integration comes nearly two months after Circle announced native USDC on Sui and will see institutional investors benefit from a reliable and secure USD-pegged stablecoin ecosystem. Stablecoin issuer Circle added native USDC on Sui in October. Adam VandenBoogaard, co-head of revenue for Americas at Copper, said: “Support USDC on the Sui blockchain is a notable step in strengthening our partnership with Sui. With much more to unlock across the stablecoin and Real-World Asset spaces, we’re committed to connecting the institutional finance world to on-chain opportunities on the Sui Network.” Integration key to DeFi Sui has seen its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem grow to a total value locked of over $2 billion. The addition of USDC via Copper’s integration will drive growth in this space even further. Sui Foundation head of ecosystem development Jameel Khalfan noted this in a statement. Currently, Sui ranks among the 10 largest DeFi chains. Jameel added, “Adding support for this asset within Copper’s enterprise-grade custody services will only add to the astounding growth of Sui as a destination for DeFi users.” The positive news for Sui also includes Phantom Wallet’s support. The layer-1 blockchain announced on Thursday that the DeFi and NFTs wallet is “coming to the Sui ecosystem.” Users will benefit from multi-chain support, native bridges, and asset swaps among other features.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/doge-christmas-dogechris-solana-memecoin-to-explode-15000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-bonk-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37277102,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51491,1733463280,Don’t Sell Your XRP: Expert Lists 8 Reasons,"Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a notable advocate in the cryptocurrency space, recently shared a compelling tweet outlining reasons to hold XRP amidst ongoing market developments. Farina’s points touch on key events and market shifts that he believes signal a promising future for XRP holders. This sentiment has sparked a broader discussion in the cryptocurrency community, with several users echoing similar optimism. Farina’s tweet listed eight critical factors: RLUSD Launch : Farina highlights the imminent launch of RLUSD (Ripple Liquidity United States Dollar), a significant development expected to increase XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and liquidity management. SEC Lawsuit Conclusion : The long-standing legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple appears to be nearing resolution. A favorable outcome could provide much-needed regulatory clarity for XRP and set a precedent for other cryptocurrencies in the U.S. market. XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) : Farina mentions potential XRP ETFs , a development that could make the asset more accessible to institutional and retail investors, further boosting demand. Bitcoin Dominance Decline : A decrease in Bitcoin’s dominance suggests a shift in market sentiment, where altcoins like XRP may capture more attention and capital. Leadership Changes at the SEC : With Gary Gensler no longer heading the SEC , there is speculation that the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies might become more favorable. Trump’s Election Victory : Farina ties political developments, including Donald Trump’s recent election win, to potential regulatory shifts that could benefit the cryptocurrency industry. Long-Term Accumulation : The years-long accumulation of XRP suggests confidence from seasoned investors, a factor Farina believes reinforces its long-term potential. Regulatory Clarity : Anticipated clarity in cryptocurrency regulations may pave the way for increased adoption and institutional interest in XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Community Reactions The tweet sparked supportive responses from other community members. John Sessums expressed skepticism about influencers urging investors to sell, suggesting they aim to lower XRP’s price for their benefit. Similarly, Pablo Tamayo emphasized the importance of understanding XRP’s value and utility, warning that scare tactics might pressure inexperienced investors into selling prematurely. Tamayo urged the community to view market dips as opportunities for strategic accumulation. Farina’s points align with broader trends in the cryptocurrency market. Regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic factors significantly influence asset performance. XRP, with its established use cases in cross-border payments and increasing interest from financial institutions, remains a strong contender for long-term growth. As Farina and others in the community suggest, XRP’s trajectory appears promising. Whether driven by regulatory breakthroughs, market dynamics, or increasing adoption, the case for holding XRP is gaining momentum.

37275461,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389856,1733463194,Crypto Bull Run: Top Altcoins That Could Explode in Coming Weeks,"The post Crypto Bull Run: Top Altcoins That Could Explode in Coming Weeks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s recent surge past $100,000 has sparked predictions of a consolidation phase, paving the way for altcoins to explode. Although Bitcoin dipped to $97,000, analyst are expecting an explosive altcoin rally . With altcoins like XRP already showing impressive growth, the market is gearing up for a major breakout, signaling the start of a potential altcoin season. Top Altcoins to Watch for Big Gains In a recent video analysis, Van de Poppe has identified several new altcoins with the potential for substantial growth in the coming months. According to him, these new coins paired with BTC will perform well in the current bull cycle. One of his top picks is Optimism (OP) , a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, is one of his top picks. With Ethereum’s scalability issues addressed, he expects Optimism to outperform Ethereum itself in the upcoming rally. He also points to SEI , a Layer-1 project that has recently undergone a price correction. Van de Poppe believes SEI could see a 3-4X increase against Bitcoin once it breaks key price levels. Omni , a smaller altcoin, is also under the analyst’s radar, as it has shown signs of breaking out from consolidation after a listing on Binance. Other Altcoins like Hedera Hashgraph , and Stellar (XLM ) are following suit, showing tremendous growth, but there’s still more room to run. Apart from these new coins, he is also bullish on Ethereum . With over $300 million invested in Ethereum ETFs , institutional investors are showing increased interest, signaling strong market potential. Crypto Market Today As of December 5, the Altcoin Season Index remains strong at 87, signaling that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Van de Poppe anticipates Bitcoin will consolidate after breaking through the $100,000 resistance level, which could pave the way for altcoins to surge. While Bitcoin experienced a brief dip, currently trading at around $97,000, its upward momentum could still benefit altcoins in the coming months. The last altcoin season in early 2021 saw altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Chainlink surge, and a similar trend may unfold this time around. With Bitcoin stabilizing, the coming months could see explosive growth for altcoins. FAQs How can Ethereum ETFs impact the altcoin market? Over $300M in Ethereum ETFs signal growing institutional interest, potentially driving up Ethereum’s value and boosting altcoins overall. Which crypto will skyrocket in 2024? Analysts predict Optimism (OP), SEI, and Ethereum may see explosive growth, driven by market trends and increased institutional interest. Which crypto can give 1000x in 2024? Low-cap altcoins like Omni could have 1000x potential, but they carry high risks.

It’s a big deal, and there’s no way around it. The job? To guide the country’s policy on two of the most important fields in tech right now—artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. But can he actually pull it off? That’s the real question. Sorce : Donald Trump Truth Social Profile Is This Role Too Much for David Sacks? Let’s be real. This job is not easy. Sacks will need to balance a lot. He’s supposed to be the middleman between the White House, Congress, and agencies like the SEC. His job is to finally give crypto the clear rules it’s been begging for, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. AI’s potential for privacy breaches, national security risks, and job losses is a huge problem, and Sacks will have to face it head-on. The question is: Can he handle it? Does He Have What It Takes? Look, David Sacks isn’t new to big challenges. He’s been involved in companies like PayPal and founded Yammer. But stepping into a role like this is a whole different beast. It’s one thing to run a company; it’s another to regulate industries that are moving faster than you can blink. He’ll have to deal with both AI and crypto, all while pushing back against Big Tech bias and protecting free speech online. Can he really juggle all of this and lead effectively? What’s at Stake? If Sacks gets this right, he could play a major part in keeping the U.S. on top when it comes to AI and cryptocurrency. But if he slips up? We could fall behind. These industries aren’t going anywhere—they’re shaping the future. The U.S. needs clear guidelines, and fast. There’s a lot riding on how Sacks handles it. What Happens Next? Now that Sacks is in the spotlight, all eyes are on him. His decisions in the coming months could make or break the U.S.’s position as a global leader in tech.

Meanwhile, Algorand’s price is also in the red zone today as the token’s RSI entered overbought levels. Since Rollblock is still in presale and remains unaffected by market trends, the new GambleFi project is all set to record a new all-time high price before the end of this week. Polygon (POL) Experiences Low Network Activity During Ongoing Correction Period Polygon’s price has shown exceptional growth over the last 30 days by recording a massive 150% jump. During this rally, Polygon’s price moved from $0.29 to $0.75 before establishing stable support at $0.71. Although Polygon is still far below its 2021 peak of $2.92, analysts believe Polygon could continue its uptrend after completing the ongoing correction period. Polygon is currently trading for $0.7154 after an intraday increase worth 3.33%. Polygon’s volume has dropped by 39.76% over the last 24 hours which typically suggests low network activity. Since Polygon’s RSI has already stepped out of the overbought zone, analysts expect Polygon to record up to 15% more gains before the end of Q4. Algorand (ALGO) Price Crashes After Exponential Rally Algorand’s price is facing a massive crash after recording 340.33% gains during the last 30 days. Since Algorand broke out of its long-term resistance pattern and reached a 938-day high on December 3 rd , analysts believe that Algorand’s rally will continue after the brief correction. If the uptrend continues, Algorand could record a new all-time high price above the $0.73 resistance. Algorand is currently trading for $0.472 after an intraday decrease of 13.88%. Algorand’s volume also decreased by 56.23% during the same period which suggests low buying activity. Since Algorand’s RSI is still in the overbought zone, analysts believe Algorand is likely to record a steeper decline towards the $0.3444 support before experiencing a resurgence. Rollblock (RBLK) Leads Q4’s Altseason Rally with Skyrocketing Presale Demand R ollblock is recording new highs every week during its viral presale stages. Since Rollblock is bringing fun and excitement back to the obsolete world of crypto trading, analysts expect Rollblock to dominate Q4’s altseason by recording up to 880% gains before the end of its presale. Since Rollblock is still in its presale stages, the platform is giving new traders the perfect opportunity to enter the market at a low price point. Aside from being a utility token, Rollblock also has a massive gaming library with 7,000+ AI-powered games where traders can win more RBLK tokens. Since user security and privacy is a huge concern in the iGambling space, Rollblock has integrated Ethereum’s latest blockchain technology to encrypt all financial data on-chain. This means traders can experience a hassle-free and provably fair gambling experience on Rollblock that is not available on traditional iGambling platforms. Aside from gaming, Rollblock also offers huge rewards to its long-term liquidity providers. With Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model, long-term investors can earn weekly staking rewards with up to 30% APYs through a buyback and token burn mechanism. Since these mechanisms also increase Rollblock’s demand on the open market and keep the circulating supply low, RBLK’s price is likely to follow a deflationary trend over time. Considering these features, it is no surprise that Rollblock investors have already pushed the token’s price up by 270% during its presale stages. Although RBLK tokens are currently selling for just $0.037 each, analysts are already expecting the token to reach its next price target at $0.041 before the end of this week.

37275525,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623563,1733462965,David Sacks appointed as first-ever White House Crypto Czar. He loves Solana,"David Sacks has been tapped by president Donald Trump to serve as the first-ever White House Crypto Czar. This new role puts David in charge of shaping U.S. crypto and AI policies, as the incoming administration doubles down on its promise to dominate both industries. He will also chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. A partner at Craft Ventures and a major figure in Silicon Valley’s elite “PayPal Mafia,” David is no stranger to crypto. His company backed Multicoin Capital, one of Solana’s earliest supporters, back in 2018. He hasn’t wavered on his faith in Solana, even after the FTX collapse, and he believes the blockchain will eventually outpace Ethereum. David is also close friends with Vice President-elect JD Vance and eccentric billionaire Elon Musk. A clear line for crypto regulations David’s new role comes as Trump tries to overhaul crypto regulations, as he promised. The president announced that: “David will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship. He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.” This framework is expected to address regulatory confusion, particularly the debate over whether digital assets are securities or commodities. David has been vocal about his preference for a system that classifies certain cryptocurrencies as commodities governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). During Trump’s campaign, crypto advocacy became a central theme. Trump attended Bitcoin conferences, accepted crypto donations, and held multiple meetings with industry leaders. His administration choices also reflect this focus. Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent are both known for their crypto-friendly views. The Crypto Czar role links David directly to Congress and federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has aggressively pursued crypto firms. David criticized this approach, predicting that the SEC’s influence over crypto would diminish under the new administration. On his podcast, All-In , he called for clear boundaries in crypto regulation. AI leadership adds to the role David’s role as chair of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology puts him at the helm of AI policy, a field Trump wants to dominate. During his first term, Trump signed executive orders prioritizing AI research. Now he plans to repeal Joe Biden’s 2023 executive order, which mandated safety testing and privacy protections for AI systems. The tech’s rapid growth has brought challenges like job displacement, security risks, and privacy concerns. David will oversee how the federal government navigates these issues while pushing for U.S. leadership in AI development. He’s also expected to work closely with Elon, whose company xAI and chatbot Grok are taking on Silicon Valley giants. Meanwhile, David will retain his position at Craft Ventures while serving as Crypto Czar. A Craft spokeswoman confirmed he wasn’t leaving the company. His status as a special government employee limits him to 130 days of service per year and allows him to avoid divesting or disclosing his financial holdings. However, he will have to recuse himself from decisions that directly impact his assets. David himself acknowledged these limitations on his podcast. He mentioned that a “key man” clause in Craft Ventures’ legal documents would likely prevent him from taking a full-time government role.

Shortly after celebrating a historic milestone by crossing $100,000 for the first time, Bitcoin suffered a sharp price drop of 5.47% within minutes, briefly dipping below $93,000. The sudden decline erased over $300 million in long positions, prompting heated reactions from traders and analysts alike. Meanwhile, financial commentary outlet FT Alphaville stirred controversy with a sarcastic “apology” to Bitcoin proponents, reigniting debates about the cryptocurrency’s resilience and the media’s long-standing skepticism. FT Alphaville Slammed for Spiteful ”Apology” as Bitcoin Hits $100K Milestone Bitcoin's rise to an all-time high above $100,000 on Dec. 5 has ignited celebrations across the crypto community while sparking controversy elsewhere. Among the voices making headlines is FT Alphaville, a daily commentary service by the Financial Times, which issued what many have dubbed a ”spiteful apology” to Bitcoin supporters. The op-ed, published on the day of Bitcoin's milestone achievement, has triggered widespread backlash on X. In a piece authored by Bryce Elder, city editor of FT Alphaville’s op-ed section, the outlet extended a biting ”apology” to those who may have refrained from investing in Bitcoin based on its coverage. The article took a sarcastic tone, stating: “We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up. It’s nice when your number goes up.” Elder further defended the outlet's critical stance on Bitcoin over the years, dismissing claims that its skepticism was rooted in support for traditional finance (tradfi). “We’re sorry if you misunderstood our crypto cynicism to be a declaration of support for tradfi, because we hate that too.” The op-ed reiterated Alphaville's long-standing criticisms of Bitcoin, labeling it a ”negative-sum game,” ”chronically inefficient,” and a ”compromised” store of value. Elder doubled down on the publication's past analyses, claiming that Bitcoin’s price remains an “arbitrary hype gauge disconnected from any utility.” The reaction from the crypto community on X was swift and unforgiving. Many dismissed the piece as a ”Cope-Pology” or a ”faux apology,” accusing FT Alphaville of lacking humility despite years of misplaced skepticism. One commenter remarked, ”Imagine being so wrong and still having this lack of humility,” reflecting the sentiment of many Bitcoin proponents who felt vindicated by the cryptocurrency's historic price milestone. Others highlighted the irony of the apology, calling it an admission of failure masked in sarcasm. FT Alphaville's critical stance on Bitcoin is nothing new. Since its first article on Bitcoin in June 2011—when the cryptocurrency was trading at $15.90—the publication has consistently framed Bitcoin as a speculative bubble. Over the years, its writers have targeted every aspect of Bitcoin, from its price to its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2014, Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve risk examiner, likened Satoshi to a ”reckless” doctor prescribing penicillin without diagnosis. Williams argued that Bitcoin’s fixed supply schedule ignored the natural ebbs and flows of economic cycles, calling it a ”poorly designed” experiment destined for failure. Despite such criticisms, Bitcoin's meteoric rise from niche internet experiment to a globally recognized asset has made it one of the most debated topics in financial media. Bitcoin's Critics Stand Firm Even as Bitcoin crosses the $100,000 threshold, it still faces staunch criticism from prominent figures in traditional finance. Legendary investor Warren Buffett has repeatedly dismissed Bitcoin as “rat poison squared,” while JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has referred to it as a “fraud” in the past. Meanwhile, financial commentator Peter Schiff has consistently predicted Bitcoin's collapse, often mocking its supporters. These critics now find themselves in the spotlight for their erroneous predictions. In November 2019, many publicly claimed Bitcoin would never hit $100,000—a claim that Bitcoin’s historic rally has decisively debunked. Bitcoin's price surge has also shifted how the media covers the cryptocurrency. While earlier narratives largely framed Bitcoin as a speculative bubble or scam, recent coverage has begun to recognize its resilience and adoption by institutions. As noted by Bitcoin proponents, the media's evolving perception mirrors broader societal acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. The controversy surrounding FT Alphaville’s “apology” shows the tension between traditional financial media and the burgeoning crypto space. While Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 marks a significant milestone, it also highlights a growing divide in how the asset is perceived. Whether the op-ed was a genuine apology or a sarcastic jab, one thing remains clear: Bitcoin’s story is far from over, and its critics will continue to grapple with its ever-changing narrative. Bitcoin's Sudden Price Plunge Wipes Out $300M in Long Positions, Shaking the Market A sharp and unexpected drop in Bitcoin's price sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market on Dec. 5, liquidating over $300 million in long positions within minutes. The dramatic 5.47% decline briefly pushed Bitcoin below $93,000 before it rebounded, leaving traders and analysts speculating on the implications for the broader market. Between 10:23 am and 10:28 am UTC, Bitcoin fell from $98,338 to $92,957, a rapid decline that erased nearly 10% of its market value in just 180 seconds. The sudden movement caused significant liquidations, with data from CoinGlass revealing $303.48 million in long positions wiped out within the hour. While Bitcoin's price has since rebounded to $96,410, the brief dip below $93,000 has left many traders reeling. The event places the spotlight on the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, even as Bitcoin recently celebrated its historic breach of the $100,000 price level. Traders Weigh In Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, provided an optimistic take, suggesting the sharp correction may have cleared excessive leverage in the market. “That wipe cleared out most of the lever on BTC. Only reason we go lower is if it spooked enough people into taking profit,” Hartmann commented on X, estimating a 70% chance that the market flush has ended. Pseudonymous crypto trader Smiley Capital highlighted the unprecedented nature of the event, calling it historic: “It took Bitcoin 3 minutes to drop ~10%, which equals ~200B drop. 180 seconds. 200 billion dollars lower,” Smiley Capital noted in a post on X. While the abrupt decline may signal a momentary setback, analysts believe it could indicate a period of consolidation rather than the end of Bitcoin's bull run. Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, suggested Bitcoin might enter a short-term plateau. “While we don’t see this as the end of the Bitcoin bull run, it does signal we are entering a consolidation phase in the days/weeks ahead,” Sycamore wrote on X. The last major consolidation phase occurred between March and October of this year, when Bitcoin traded between $53,000 and $72,000 following its then-all-time high of $73,679. If history repeats itself, the market could stabilize within a similar range before resuming its upward trajectory. Bitcoin’s rapid rise to $100,000, culminating in a new all-time high of $104,000 on Dec. 4, has been fueled by strong institutional demand and tightening supply. The year saw over $31 billion in net inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, combined with reduced Bitcoin issuance following April's halving event. Despite the bullish backdrop, such rapid price increases are often accompanied by heightened volatility. Analysts suggest the market’s reaction to the Dec. 5 plunge will offer insights into its resilience and potential for further growth. Bitcoin's ability to recover quickly from the sudden drop may reaffirm its growing maturity as an asset class. However, the event serves as a reminder of the market’s susceptibility to extreme volatility, especially in times of heightened leverage and speculative trading. While the near-term outlook may involve consolidation, the broader picture remains one of optimism. Many analysts continue to predict higher price targets for Bitcoin, with some forecasting a potential climb to $124,000 or beyond by the end of the year.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6403/financial-times-faces-criticism-over-bitcoin-apology-amid-100-k-milestone,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

But ever since Pepe began popping in 2023, memecoins have been printing gains and making everyone from the TradFi squares to the Bitcoin maxis very, very angry. Now bigger than ever, this unstoppable rise of memecoins has been dubbed the memecoin supercycle. And with its unique approach as the first ever memecoin portfolio, Vantard has been killing it. $910k raised and posting 74.74% gains—investors are having trouble containing their excitement. The memecoin supercycle: Offering a golden ticket to gain city Memecoin mania started in Q1 and hasn’t really cooled down since. If this graph doesn’t excite you, nothing else will. Source: CoinGecko Bitcoin is steadily rising. Jacking up risk-on sentiment and creating a storm of potential for altcoins to start popping in 2025 when investors inevitably rotate their BTC profits into something offering bigger gains. An opportunity no investor wants to miss out on—enter memecoins. Popularized by memecoin flag waver Murad Mahmudov , the memecoin supercycle is the theory that’s proving more accurate by the day. It’s the theory that memecoins will be the best play for all of next year thanks to their viral and retail appeal, powering rapid and outsized gains. Why Vantard makes winning the memecoin supercycle easy But that graph above can be deceptive. Because we all know that for every high flyer, there are countless pieces of memecoin vapourware wallowing in wallets of shame. You could go neck-deep in meme coins, getting 3 hours of sleep a night in the hope of picking a winner. Or you could let the memecoin experts do the hard work for you. That’s what Vantard is. Vantard’s quants work day in and day out, sourcing the best memecoins for the Vantard portfolio. All Vantard investors will get a slice of this pie. A pie that’s currently up 74.74%. Vantard’s beauty is that it effortlessly exposes you to all the best memecoins on the market with a single investment, keeping you ahead of the market and saving you from doing all-nighters. If you’d been exposed to bluechip memes like Popcat earlier this year, you’d be up over 15,000% . Similarly, bluechip in the making, Gigachad has delivered gains of as much as +7000% . Vantard’s quants are digging deep, exposing holders to future blue chips and the promising low-cap gems so that you’re covered for next year.

Vantard is set to do the same as millions of meme-curious investors who can’t stand the FOMO any longer but don’t know which dog or cat to choose. The difference is Bitcoin is likely offering around a 2x at best right now. Memecoins offer you a 50x or 100x in your sleep. The memecoin supercycle won’t be around forever, though. And investors likely have roughly a year to bank as much as possible. The earlier you allocate, the better.

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $725 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance).

Initial support on the downside is near the $715 level. The next major support is near the $700 level. The main support sits at $685. If there is a downside break below the $685 support, the price could drop toward the $665 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $650 level.

There were key announcements like the Solana ETP in Canada and the launch of a $60 million Solana startup fund, followed by VanEck’s filing for a Solana ETF. The filing has sparked increased interest, as VanEck sees Solana as a competitor to Ethereum, praising its scalability, speed, and low costs—factors that make it ideal for payments, trading, gaming, and decentralized finance. However, in a latest development, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared on X that she has confirmed the SEC has informed at least two of the five prospective issuers that it will reject their 19b4 filings for the SOL spot ETFs. Sources suggest that the SEC is unlikely to approve any new crypto ETFs under the current administration. https://twitter.com/ComfyGwei/status/1864877051515175268 When a user speculated that at least one ETF could be approved, Terrett replied and said, “The SEC won’t approve just one or a couple and not the others. Remember the bitcoin ETFs? Eleven launched on the same day.” James Seyffart and other analysts predict that the Solana ETF might not launch until 2025, particularly if there is a regime change at the SEC. However, the progress made recently, combined with ongoing ETF filings for other crypto assets, signals the potential for more growth in the crypto market over the coming years. In Other News…. The SEC has responded to a request to dismiss its amended lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Binance.US, as well as former CEO Changpeng Zhao. The SEC’s brief opposes Binance’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which claims that Binance operated an unregistered securities exchange. The SEC also alleges that Binance sold several cryptocurrencies, including BNB, as unregistered securities. Binance had previously sought to dismiss these allegations, challenging the SEC’s interpretation. Reflecting on the same, Ripple CLO said, “Instead of standing down and pausing crypto litigation with new leadership just weeks away, Gensler’s SEC filed an 81-page brief in the Binance case yesterday, recycling the same failed arguments—including the absurd (and unsupported) claim that crypto has no inherent value.”",NEGATIVE,SOL | BNB,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SOL | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/gensler-led-sec-set-to-reject-solana-spot-etf-filings-report/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Data shows that in the last three days, XRP decreased by nearly 16% and is currently being traded at $2.3.

This triggered some of the altcoins like Ethereum that traded close to $4000 but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance. However, among the top gainers was JasmyCoin, which broke the 2-year consolidation and marked highs close to $0.06 for the first time since January 2022. Therefore, the JASMY price is believed to revamp a significant upswing after undergoing a small consolidation, as the bulls seem to be poised for a 100% upswing. Ever since the token rose above the multi-year consolidation zone around $0.02, the buzz around the crypto was why the JASMY price is surging so much. JasmyCoin reacted to the BTC price rally positively, which was fueled by a couple of collaborations to strengthen the DePin space. The platform has collaborated with IOTEX, aiming to drive DePin innovation & empower users across the market. Now that the price is displaying massive bullish momentum, the question rises: whether the price can make it to $0.1 this weekend? JASMY price is displaying huge potential in maintaining a strong ascending trend as the upper cap remains pretty higher than the current levels. The RSI displays the possibility of a pullback but the 50/200 day MA is poised for a bullish crossover, indicating the revival of a bullish trend. Now that the price maintains an 18% jump after an 80% rise in the past trading day, the next upper target could be around $0.061 at 1.4 FIB. Although the price is facing significant upward pressure, the bulls are trying hard to push the prices higher. Therefore, the token is believed to test the resistance at $0.0595 in a short while from now. A breakout could push the prices higher but a rejection may lead to consolidation until the markets display the next bullish move. JASMY crypto is becoming one of the strongest in the long term. With its use cases and growing adoption, it has great potential for future gains. Therefore, the price target may not be restricted to $0.1, as the token carries huge potential to achieve the range between $0.2 and $0.25 if the bulls hold a tight grip over the rally.",POSITIVE,BTC | JASMY,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | JASMY,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/jasmycoin-consolidates-after-smashing-a-2-year-high-heres-whats-next-for-the-jasmy-price-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Formed in the early 2000s, this group has shaped the tech industry through successful ventures and investments, leveraging their strong networks and collaboration. He also gained prominence by founding Yammer, which he sold to Microsoft in 2012 for about $1.2b. Reports earlier indicated that the incoming Trump administration considered Chris Giancarlo , former CFTC chair, for the “crypto czar” role. Former Trump Critic Rises as Crypto Advocate and Administration Ally Sacks’ appointment signals that the second Trump administration is rewarding Silicon Valley figures who supported his campaign. Moreover, it indicates that the administration will push for policies generally supported by crypto entrepreneurs. Earlier this year, Sacks became a major Trump booster by hosting a fundraiser in San Francisco for the then-Republican nominee. At this event, tickets went for $50,000 each, with a $300,000 tier that offered perks like a photo with Trump. This represented a stark change for Sacks, who had sharply criticized Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Shortly after, on an episode of his All-In podcast, Sacks stated that Trump was “clearly” responsible for the January 6 events and had disqualified himself from national candidacy. In recent years, Sacks has gained prominence as the host of the All-In podcast, co-hosting with investors Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis and David Friedberg. In his post, Trump described it as the “top podcast in Tech,” where they discuss economic, political and social issues. This week, Trump named Paul Atkins , a seasoned financial regulator and crypto advocate, to head the SEC.

Accompanying his post was a detailed chart outlining the “Double Tops” RSI pattern observed over multiple market cycles and its implications for XRP’s price trajectory. According to the analyst, this repeating phenomenon indicates XRP’s potential ascent to double-digit price levels. The Double Tops RSI Pattern Explained Egrag’s analysis delves into XRP’s historical weekly RSI behavior, identifying a consistent movement across past market cycles: In the first top, the RSI peaks, followed by a sharp decline. For the Second Top, the RSI climbs again, forming the final peak of a bull run. This two-step RSI pattern has reportedly coincided with significant price movements in XRP’s history, signaling the culmination of bullish trends. Based on this historical data, Egrag believes that XRP may again follow this pattern, potentially achieving unprecedented price levels.

He projected that XRP could initially hit a range of $4.85 to $6.40, followed by a significant correction, and then embark on another upward surge. Egrag elaborated on his expectations for corrections, stating that a 70% correction from $6.40 could see XRP retrace to $1.92, which he identified as a strong support level before a subsequent 5-10X rally. Similarly, a 70% correction from $4.85 would bring the price to $1.46, again followed by a potential 5-10X recovery. To manage such volatility, Egrag advised his followers to employ both dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and dollar-sell averaging, acknowledging the unpredictability of XRP’s ultimate peak price.

Historically, XRP has exhibited rapid price increases during bullish phases, often followed by equally sharp corrections. Egrag’s analysis has resonated with many in the XRP community , particularly given the asset’s recent price performance and growing institutional interest. However, some investors remain cautious, emphasizing the importance of considering broader market conditions and regulatory developments. As XRP continues to garner attention from institutional players and retail investors, the coming months could provide critical insights into whether the asset fulfills the ambitious forecasts set forth by analysts like Egrag.

37273929,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389836,1733459883,Bitcoin Price Rebounds to $97K: CIFDAQ Founder Predicts Continued Volatility in the Crypto Market,"The post Bitcoin Price Rebounds to $97K: CIFDAQ Founder Predicts Continued Volatility in the Crypto Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin recently crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time, having skyrocketed nearly 140% this year. This surge has generated excitement, especially with the anticipation that President-elect Donald Trump will support cryptocurrencies. Trump has expressed his goal to make America the “crypto capital of the planet” and even proposed creating a national stockpile of Bitcoin. But alongside this milestone, the altcoin market is also showing movement, with Ethereum breaking its retracement levels and XRP surging past its 2021 high to $2.90. While Bitcoin’s rise is grabbing headlines, the question ‘what’s next’ is also haunting investors. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has retraced back to the $97k levels and is down by more than five percent. This moment feels eerily similar to the crypto boom of 2017 when Bitcoin broke $10,000 and the media machine kicked into high gear. That was when the altcoin market truly took off, creating a frenzy of gains. Now, with Bitcoin reaching $100,000, we might be witnessing the beginning of a similar surge in altcoins, where volatility and quick gains are the name of the game. However, the question remains: is Bitcoin’s rise a sign of continued growth, or is it entering a consolidation phase? Himanshu Maradiya, Chairman and Founder, CIFDAQ, told Coinpedia, “Bitcoin’s leap past the $100,000 mark isn’t just a financial milestone—it’s a historic moment that cements the growing clout of decentralized assets in the mainstream. For investors, the spotlight now shifts to long-term planning: keeping an eye on market cycles, diversifying portfolios, and staying updated on regulatory shifts.” He added, “While this breakthrough fuels optimism, it’s important to tread carefully—volatility remains part of the game. Seasoned investors see this as a chance to reassess risk strategies, while newcomers are urged to prioritize learning the ropes before diving in. The road ahead will demand both patience and conviction.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-rebounds-to-97k-cifdaq-founder-predicts-continued-volatility-in-the-crypto-market/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Garlinghouse retweeted a post by Austin Reid, the global head of revenue and business at crypto brokerage firm FalconX, who reported significant growth in XRP trading. Reid stated , “XRP trading is on fire.” He then highlighted that FalconX witnessed a “10x growth in volume between the first and second halves of Q4.” He emphasized that this surge is not solely a result of increased retail interest but is largely driven by institutional participation. Over the past week, XRP has delivered a staggering 117% increase in its market value, climbing from $1.30 to a peak of $2.80. After experiencing a 24% drop on Tuesday, XRP regained but is now down 9% in the last 24 hours, trading at $2.30. The cryptocurrency’s monthly performance has been impressive. It added $100 billion to its market capitalization and reclaimed the third spot among cryptocurrencies by market value. Ripple Identifies Banking Challenges and Solutions In a related development, Ripple has addressed several key issues that local banks face with cross-border payments. In a detailed post , Ripple outlined six major obstacles encountered by banks. These include high transfer costs and hidden fees, slow transaction settlements, limited access to payment networks, reliability concerns, compliance complexities, and liquidity shortages. Ripple’s post explains how its payment solution can mitigate these challenges. To reduce costs, Ripple Payments offers a low-cost transactional platform suitable for remittances. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Settlement delays can be resolved through Ripple’s transparent payment tracker, which operates during non-business hours, including weekends and holidays. This service enhances transaction reliability and overall customer satisfaction. To address limited access, Ripple Payments connects users to a global payment network featuring advanced tools designed for efficient and affordable transfers.

Ripple also emphasizes that unreliable services and liquidity constraints, which harm banks’ reputations and hinder operational efficiency are alleviated through its innovative offerings. The article positions Ripple Payments as a comprehensive solution for financial institutions aiming to modernize their cross-border payment operations. Institutional Momentum and Market Outlook According to analysts and market observers, XRP’s dramatic rise reflects broader institutional interest. This shift marks a new phase for the cryptocurrency, aligning with Ripple’s ongoing efforts to address inefficiencies in global financial systems. As XRP consolidates above $2, its appeal among institutional investors grows, further driving market momentum. By spotlighting these developments, Garlinghouse underscores XRP’s evolving role in the financial sector and Ripple’s commitment to innovation.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-rescues-usa-trumpusa-solana-memecoin-will-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Monero’s price has soared to a two-year high, while Kaspa’s innovative protocol has delivered astronomical growth for early investors. Stories like these are putting these projects firmly on the radar of cryptocurrency enthusiasts looking for strong long-term opportunities. Amid this competition, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a transformative force in the crypto world. Offering solutions to real-world problems through asset tokenization, it’s creating new ways to democratise investments. With its presale currently underway and strong analyst predictions, Qubetics is quickly being recognised as one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics’ Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics ($TICS) is making strides by enabling the tokenization of real-world assets , allowing individuals and businesses to digitize physical assets like real estate and commodities. This process increases liquidity and provides fractional ownership opportunities. For instance, a small business owner can tokenize their property to raise capital without traditional loans, while an art collector can sell shares of a valuable piece to multiple investors. This democratization of asset ownership has the potential to revolutionize various industries. Qubetics, which experts are calling one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for the long term , is currently in its 11th presale stage, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0282 each. To date, over 270 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 6,500 holders, raising upwards of $4.4 million. Each presale stage lasts seven days, concluding every Sunday at midnight, with a 10% price increase at the start of each new stage. For more information about this project, you can watch this video . Qubetics Offers Promising Investment Returns Qubetics is showing incredible potential for early investors, with analysts forecasting impressive returns. By the end of the presale, $TICS is predicted to climb to $0.25, offering a remarkable 783% return on investment (ROI). After the presale, projections suggest $TICS could reach $1 , delivering a 3,434% ROI. As adoption grows, the price could hit $5, translating into a 17,570% ROI, and potentially $15 following the mainnet launch, which would result in an astonishing 52,912% ROI. To put this into perspective, an investment of $7,500 during the presale at the current price could grow to approximately $3.97 million if $TICS achieves $15 post-launch. These numbers highlight why Qubetics is being recognised as a high-growth opportunity in the crypto market. Monero’s Recent Surge Monero (XMR), known for its privacy features, has recently hit a two-year high of $211.07. This rise is partly due to a U.S. court ruling that overturned sanctions on Tornado Cash, a coin-mixing protocol, sparking renewed interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. However, Monero’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. Regulatory concerns have led to its delisting from major exchanges like Binance, impacting its availability. Despite these hurdles, Monero remains a significant player in the crypto space, especially for those valuing transaction privacy. Kaspa’s Impressive Growth Kaspa has shown remarkable growth, with its value increasing by over 51,000% from June 2022 to August 2024. This success is attributed to its GHOSTDAG protocol, which enhances transaction speed and scalability. The network’s appeal has attracted investors and miners alike. For example, a Texas student invested $5,000 in Kaspa when it was priced at $0.02 per token and saw his investment grow to $50,000 as the price rose to $0.2074. This story highlights the potential returns for early investors in innovative crypto projects. Conclusion As the crypto landscape evolves, platforms like Monero and Kaspa continue to innovate and integrate with existing financial systems. However, Qubetics ($TICS) offers unique solutions through real-world asset tokenization, addressing challenges that predecessors have not fully resolved. With its ongoing presale and promising analyst predictions, Qubetics stands out as one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for the long term.

The agency is looking to set up a new team to monitor crypto ATM services that may be breaching anti-money laundering rules. In a recent statement on December 6, Brendan Thomas (CEO of AUSTRAC) shared that the agency will focus on the crypto industry from the beginning of 2025. He says that crypto and crypto ATMs are easy to find and allow quick, permanent transactions, which makes them “attractive avenues for criminals looking to launder money.” It is an initial step for the AUSTRAC to reduce the illegal use of cryptocurrency in Australia. The agency will continue to keep an eye on crypto ATMs moving into 2025. AUSTRAC says that violations will result in hefty financial penalties AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas announced a new team at AUSTRAC will ensure crypto ATM operators obey rules aimed at reducing the risk of dirty money flowing through their machines. The four largest crypto ATM companies in Australia are Coinflip (680 machines), Localcoin (465 machines), Cryptolink, (75 machines), and Nova (30 machines). Crypto ATM operators already have to register with AUSTRAC, run identity checks on their customers, and monitor transactions. They must also file a report concerning any suspicious activities if the cash withdrawn or deposited is more than $6,500 (10,000 Australian dollars). He added, “As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so too will criminal exploitation.” The new task force will work to eliminate illicit activities that don’t operate under the law.

37273627,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51483,1733456768,How XRP Ledger’s AMM and RLUSD Are Set to Shape Institutional Finance,"The XRP Ledger (XRPL) continues to solidify its position as a leader in institutional adoption, combining speed, efficiency, and reliability to address modern financial challenges. Max Avery, a prominent crypto advocate, recently highlighted the transformative potential of XRPL’s Automated Market Maker (AMM) and RLUSD stablecoin, emphasizing their significance in shaping the future of institutional finance and decentralized ecosystems. A Foundation of Speed and Reliability As Avery pointed out, the XRP Ledger stands out for its unparalleled transaction speed, completing transactions in 3–5 seconds with costs measured in fractions of a penny. Such performance makes it ideal for high-frequency, high-value activities, including cross-border payments and the tokenization of real-world assets. The ledger’s decade-long track record of zero downtime reinforces its reputation for reliability—a critical requirement for institutional participants like banks and asset managers. Additionally, XRPL’s carbon-neutral infrastructure aligns with the increasing focus on sustainability, making it a viable choice for environmentally conscious enterprises. Avery emphasized that reliability and sustainability are non-negotiable for institutions entering the blockchain space, and the XRPL excels in both areas. AMM: Redefining Market Mechanics Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are integral to decentralized finance, replacing traditional order books with liquidity pools to facilitate efficient, instant trading. Avery noted that the XRPL’s AMM takes this concept to the next level by seamlessly integrating it with its decentralized exchange (DEX). This dual-layer approach caters to diverse user needs, allowing retail and institutional players to trade using liquidity pools or conventional order books. The XRPL’s AMM employs a Constant Product Formula for price discovery, requiring liquidity providers to deposit two tokens in fixed ratios. Liquidity providers earn fees proportional to their contributions, ensuring fair returns in a decentralized and permissionless trading environment. Avery highlighted innovations like “auction mode,” which optimizes arbitrage opportunities and mitigates impermanent loss, making the XRPL’s AMM particularly appealing for institutional applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 RLUSD: Stability for Institutional Adoption The RLUSD stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and fully collateralized, offers the transparency and stability that compliance-driven institutions require. By minimizing volatility, RLUSD serves as a dependable medium of exchange and a safe harbor during periods of market fluctuation. Avery emphasized RLUSD’s strategic role in enhancing XRPL’s AMM, creating a synergy that appeals to institutional investors. This pairing boosts efficiency for large-scale transactions and improves the overall utility of the ecosystem. RLUSD’s integration also provides a seamless on-ramp for traditional financial institutions (TradFi) into decentralized markets, bridging the gap between conventional and blockchain-based finance. A Unified Ecosystem The interplay between XRPL’s AMM, RLUSD, and XRP as the native asset creates a cohesive financial ecosystem. XRPL’s robust infrastructure ensures deep liquidity, while RLUSD enhances stability, making the ecosystem highly attractive to institutions. Avery observed that the use of XRP as the backbone for liquidity fosters adoption and supports the growth of decentralized finance within XRPL’s framework. Avery’s insights underscore XRPL’s advancements, ensuring it remains at the forefront of institutional blockchain adoption. These developments are creating new opportunities and reshaping how global finance operates, positioning the XRPL as a critical platform for the future of finance.

37272725,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389832,1733456603,David Sacks Appointed as Crypto Czar by Donald Trump to Lead AI and Blockchain Policies,"The post David Sacks Appointed as Crypto Czar by Donald Trump to Lead AI and Blockchain Policies appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After Bitcoin reached the $100K milestone, Donald Trump made another huge appointment, this time in the AI and Tech sector. He named David Sacks, a tech heavyweight and former COO of PayPal, as his White House Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cryptocurrency Czar. This announcement comes just a day after Trump selected Paul Atkins, a well-known cryptocurrency advocate, to chair the SEC. This is a big change for the crypto industry, which suffered tremendous losses due to the SEC’s overreach and unfair regulations. These regulations complicated trading for not only US citizens but also stopped big companies from entering the crypto space for a very long time. Post-election, many new companies are heading towards Bitcoin from all sorts of sectors, like AI, Healthcare, Automobiles, and Technology. In the meanwhile, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $103,679 on December 5, 2024, showcasing its immense growth since its all-time low of $67.81 on July 6, 2013. While it has dipped 6.11% from its peak, the staggering 143,450% rise from its lowest point underscores its long-term growth trajectory and resilience in the market. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $ 97,341. Why David Sacks? Trump’s choice of Sacks is no surprise. Sacks is a highly respected entrepreneur with a stellar track record in the tech world. He’s invested in major companies like Facebook, SpaceX, Airbnb, and Palantir through his venture fund, Craft Ventures. He also co-founded Yammer, a software company Microsoft acquired for over $1 billion. In his new role, Sacks will be responsible for guiding U.S. policy in two critical areas: artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Trump highlighted the importance of Sacks’ role, saying he would work to make America a global leader in these fields while ensuring free speech is protected from what he called “Big Tech bias and censorship.” Clear Crypto Rules on the Way One of Sacks’ key tasks will be to develop a clear legal framework for the cryptocurrency industry. This clarity has been a long-standing demand from crypto companies struggling with regulatory uncertainty. Trump said Sacks’ work will help the U.S. crypto market thrive. Moreover, Sacks will also chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, where he will drive innovation in AI and other cutting-edge technologies. Industry Cheers for Sacks The tech and crypto community is excited about this move. Chris Pavlovski, CEO of Rumble, called it a win for free speech and praised Sacks’ expertise. Dennis Porter, a crypto advocate, said Sacks’ industry knowledge and bold approach make him the perfect fit for this role. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse congratulated David Sacks on his appointment as the White House AI and Crypto Czar, praising his deep understanding of technology and his alignment with pro-innovation policies for crypto and AI under President Trump. Garlinghouse called this a “dream team,” reflecting high optimism for Sacks’ role in advancing tech innovation in the U.S. This appointment signals Trump’s focus on positioning the U.S. as a tech powerhouse, balancing innovation with regulatory clarity and free speech safeguards.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/david-sacks-appointed-as-crypto-czar-by-donald-trump-to-lead-ai-and-blockchain-policies/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

However, the coin is up by more than 50 percent in the past week. XRP is currently consolidating at a high level above its 2021 bull market peak. Today, the price is moving sideways, which is typical after a rally. Even though XRP has dropped from its recent high, it’s still relatively close to where the rally began. Current Wave Structure XRP is in a larger third wave of a bullish cycl e. This move includes smaller subwaves, and we are actively tracking these. Right now, XRP might be in the fourth wave of this structure, but the overall rally is not over yet. While there’s potential for a deeper correction, the focus remains on higher prices. Support and Resistance Levels There’s not enough data to confirm if a major correction is starting, but analysts are watching key support levels. The price may find support between $1.15 and $1.79 if it pulls back, but this is still speculative. Market Action: Corrective or Bullish? XRP seems to be in a corrective phase right now, which could mean sideways consolidation or a sharper pullback. Corrections often lead to indecision, so we might see small ups and downs without a clear trend. Future Price Targets If the price moves higher, the next targets are around $3.20 to $3.30 (previous highs) and possibly $4.20. However, the next big move depends on support levels holding up and whether the rally continues. Micro Support Areas On the smaller time frame, support is located between $2.33 and $2.06, with additional support at $2.21. There has been no impulsive price reaction yet, so the market is still uncertain.

Bitcoin Price Surpasses $100,000 In a post on Truth Social, Trump expressed his excitement and support, stating, “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” Trump’s Bitcoin endorsement aligns with his campaign promises to position the United States as the “crypto capital of the world.” His administration, set to begin on January 20, 2025, is expected to implement significant regulatory changes through agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Related Reading: Hut 8 Unveils $750 Million Initiative To Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve These proposed adjustments are critical to fostering the growth of the digital asset ecosystem, which Trump believes will be a cornerstone of his presidency and a notable shift from President Biden’s administration and treatment of the nascent financial sector. The timing of Trump’s announcement coincides with the resignation of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who stated that his last day at the agency will also be January 20. This transition is anticipated to pave the way for former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who is expected to take the helm with a pro-crypto vision. Legal chief Dan Gallagher of Robinhood Markets expressed confidence in Atkins, noting, “Paul Atkins was made for this job,” and predicting that he would tackle the industry’s concerns regarding “regulation by enforcement” from day one. BTC Valuation Surpasses Major Public Companies The recent surge past $100,000 has propelled Bitcoin’s market capitalization to over $2 trillion, making it a more substantial asset than most public companies, including tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet. This valuation also surpasses the government bond markets of several countries, including Spain and Brazil, and approaches the market capitalization of the FTSE 100 Index in the UK. Analysts are optimistic about the future, with Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper Technologies, stating that reaching $100,000 indicates the beginning of a new phase in the bull market, one that appears resilient to external shocks. Manuel Villegas, a digital assets analyst at Julius Baer, added that the demand for Bitcoin remains strong, suggesting the possibility of a supply squeeze in the coming year, similar to previous trends. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Bounces Back: Is a New Rally Brewing? Moreover, Trump’s return to the White House could signal a shift in government involvement in Bitcoin. During a Bitcoin conference earlier this year, Trump proposed the idea of creating a strategic stockpile of Bitcoin, starting with assets seized by the US government. Allies like Robert Kennedy Jr. and Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis have even suggested that the government could purchase 1 million Bitcoin, worth approximately $100 billion at current prices, as a means to back the US dollar. Starting Thursday, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $104,150 per coin, marking a substantial 6.6% surge within 24 hours. However, since that peak, the price has retraced to around $103,000 The question now is whether this upward trend can be sustained or if profit-taking by investors will lead to a correction for the leading digital asset. The future outlook will also depend on the next key support level, with $100,000 as a critical point that could facilitate further price increases.

37272300,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51465,1733455291,Reserve For Every XRP Wallet Dropped to 1 XRP On Dec. 2nd. Here’s the Implication,"On December 2, 2024, the account reserve requirement for wallets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) was reduced from 10 XRP to 1 XRP, marking a significant milestone in the blockchain’s evolution. This change reflects a broader effort to make XRPL more accessible and user-friendly for a diverse global audience. The decision has sparked discussions among cryptocurrency experts, who have varying perspectives on its potential impact on XRP’s price and ecosystem. The Reserve Reduction in Context The reserve requirement is a specific amount of XRP that must be held in a wallet to activate and maintain it. Originally set at 20 XRP, this reserve was lowered to 10 XRP in the past, and now to 1 XRP. Wietse Wind, founder of XRPL Labs and a prominent developer in the XRPL ecosystem, was a key proponent of this reduction. In a proposal detailed by Times Tabloid in October, Wind emphasized the importance of lowering the reserve to enhance accessibility. He argued that the previous reserve fee of 10 XRP hindered participation in regions with limited economic capacity, creating a barrier for many potential users and projects. By reducing this threshold to 1 XRP, the change aims to encourage broader adoption and engagement with the XRPL ecosystem. Speculation About XRP’s Price Wall Street veteran and financial expert Linda P. Jones highlighted an intriguing pattern in her analysis. She noted that reserve reductions on the XRPL have historically preceded price increases for XRP. She stated, “The reserve requirement has usually dropped ahead of an XRP price increase and has averaged around $4 to $16. Does a drop to 1 XRP imply a price of $4 to $16 per XRP soon?” Every wallet that holds XRP has a reserve requirement. It used to be 20 XRP, then it was reduced to 10 XRP. Dec. 2nd it was reduced to 1 XRP. The reserve requirement has usually dropped ahead of an #XRP price increase and has averaged around $4 to $16. Does a drop to 1 XRP imply… pic.twitter.com/h7KMY1jVk3 — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) December 3, 2024 However, the correlation between reserve reductions and price increases remains speculative. An XRPL validator known as “Vet” responded , suggesting that the reduction is driven by increased price, greater network capacity, and lowering entry barriers for XRPL users, rather than being a direct indicator of future price movements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Implications of Reserve Changes The reduction in the reserve requirement has also prompted discussions about the cost of self-custody for XRP holders. A user named “333” on X observed , “The more XRP goes up, the more it will cost to self-custody. Some people may not have 20, 30, or 50 dollars to spend to have their wallet. Some will be priced out of simply owning.” This perspective underscores the balance that must be struck between accessibility and maintaining network security. While a lower reserve may foster broader adoption, significant price increases for XRP could inadvertently create barriers for smaller investors, potentially pricing them out of the ecosystem.

Don’t Let this Presale Be Another Regret—Grab the Best Meme Coin Presale with 1000X Potential!,"In the crazy world of meme coins, opportunities flash by faster than a viral TikTok trend. Remember Turbo Coin (TURBO)? It started small, just another meme coin with big dreams, and shot to fame, creating life-changing wealth for early adopters. But if you hesitated, you likely missed its rocket to the moon. And let’s face it—missing out on Turbo feels like watching the parade from the sidelines. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the fresh face on the block that’s rewriting the meme coin game. With its jaw-dropping presale success—over $1 million raised in just ten days and 23 billion coins already sold—BTFD isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. A play-to-earn (P2E) game, 90% staking APY, and a vibrant community of over 2,400 holders are just a few of the reasons why this coin screams “Don’t miss this!” Let’s dive into how BTFD might just be the Best Meme Coin Presale with 1000X Potential you’ve been waiting for.

Let’s do some quick maths: a $2,500 investment at the presale price would fetch you 39,062,500 BTFD coins. By the time BTFD hits its listing price, that stash could balloon to $23,437.50.

TURBO: The Wealth Train You Missed Turbo Coin started as a small community project, with no clear roadmap and minimal fanfare. Yet, its decentralised ethos and meme-driven charm struck a chord with crypto enthusiasts. Before anyone could blink, TURBO went from obscurity to a household name in the crypto world. Early investors who spent just a few hundred bucks walked away with six-figure payouts when the coin surged to unimaginable heights. But here’s the thing—Turbo wasn’t just about luck. It was about recognising the cultural power of memes and the strength of community-driven tokens. As of now, TURBO’s growth has steadied, making it a legendary “what could have been” story for latecomers. Had you thrown in $2,500 when TURBO was at its rock-bottom presale price, you might’ve been counting stacks instead of regrets. Missed it? It’s alright—because history is knocking on your door again with BTFD Coin. Why Analysts Are Eyeing BTFD Crypto analysts are already predicting BTFD will emerge as one of the Best Meme Coin Presales with 1000X Potential. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, token scarcity and burning mechanisms could further boost its value. Analysts foresee BTFD not just listing at $0.0006 but potentially climbing into the top meme coin ranks alongside giants like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out—Join the Presale Now!

37271954,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389822,1733454306,SEC vs Crypto: Gary’s Final Strike on Crypto Before Departure,"The post SEC vs Crypto: Gary’s Final Strike on Crypto Before Departure appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Gary Gensler is stepping down as SEC Chair on January 20, 2025. But before leaving, he has made a final strike against the crypto world. The SEC, under his watch, filed an 81-page document targeting Binance. It opposes Binance’s motion to dismiss its lawsuit, calling Binance Coin (BNB) and ten other tokens securities. Let’s unpack what this means for Binance and the broader crypto market. SEC’s Target: Eleven Cryptocurrencies The SEC is not happy targeting just Binance Coin. Along with BNB, it labeled ten more tokens as securities: Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), The Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), Axie Infinity (AXS), and COTI. Source : courtlistener But the filing goes beyond naming tokens. The SEC accuses Binance of more than just selling them. It claims Binance promoted secondary markets for these tokens. Why does that matter? Because it allegedly encouraged investors to see these tokens as profit-making opportunities. Ripple’s partial victory earlier this year shaped the SEC’s arguments too. That case ruled XRP’s secondary sales weren’t securities. So now, the SEC is being extra careful to cover those gaps. How Binance is Being Called Out The SEC’s case rests on something called the Howey Test. In simple terms, this test asks three things to decide if something is a security: Was money invested? Was there a common goal? Did people expect profits from someone else’s work? The SEC says Binance ticks all three boxes. It claims Binance tied token value to its ecosystem’s growth, making users think they were investing. What’s more, the SEC argues secondary market trades are also securities. Binance has said otherwise, but this filing directly challenges that. Ethereum and Bitcoin: Why Are They Spared? Not everyone agrees with the SEC’s methods. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s legal chief, called out what he sees as selective enforcement. In a tweet, he asked why Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC)—the two biggest cryptocurrencies—are always left out. Yesterday @SECGov filed eight-one pages of arguments that secondary trading of BNB and ten other tokens triggers liability under Howey. But do they offer ONE WORD explaining how this same bogus logic somehow avoids ETH? Or BTC? Nope. Because they can't. 1/3 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 5, 2024 It’s a fair question. ETH and BTC dominate the market. Yet, they’re nowhere in this filing. Ripple’s case may have influenced the SEC’s tactics here, but critics are still scratching their heads. What This Means for Crypto If the SEC wins, the fallout could be huge. Tokens labeled as securities might vanish from platforms like Binance. Developers and investors would face stricter rules, which could slow innovation and growth. The SEC’s goal is clear: take control of the crypto market. By targeting both token sales and secondary trades, it’s trying to set a firm legal standard. What’s Next? This filing isn’t a new lawsuit. It’s the SEC doubling down on its claims against Binance. But the exclusion of Ethereum and Bitcoin? That raises serious questions about fairness. As Gensler prepares to leave, this feels like his last big move. For crypto, the stakes are massive. The court’s decision could either bring clarity—or turn the market upside down.",NEGATIVE,ETH | BNB,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/sec-vs-crypto-garys-final-strike-on-crypto-before-departure/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37274457,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107736,1733454055,3 XRP Price Competitors That Will Rise from Pennies to $3 as the Altcoin Season Begins,"With the altcoin season on the horizon, XRP price isn’t the only altcoin movement investors are eyeing. Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM), and RCO Finance (RCOF) are emerging as strong competitors, each with unique use cases and massive growth potential. Here’s why these three could make headlines with explosive gains by 2025. Hedera: Scalable Blockchain for Enterprises Set to Rival the XRP Price Movement Canary Capital has formally registered an S-1 with the SEC for an exchange-traded fund based on Hedera’s HBAR altcoin. Hedera is developing its platform to compete with other top projects. If approved , this would be the first Hedera spot ETF, giving investors exposure to the value of HBAR, the Hedera network’s native altcoin, according to the submission. Hedera shines as an enterprise-focused blockchain with unmatched speed and efficiency. Priced at $0.3427, analysts expect it to climb by 24.25% and reach $ 0.447788 by 2025 and possibly $3 by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Partnerships with tech giants like Google strengthen its growth outlook. Stellar: Powering Cross-Border Payments As The XLM Altcoin Surges Stellar’s native altcoin XLM has seen a massive rise, climbing over 470% on the monthly chart and now joining the top 15 cryptocurrency list with a market capitalization of $16.38 billion, according to CNF. XLM has a market capitalization of $16.16 billion and has witnessed a 20% increase in daily trading volume to $3.10 billion. Stellar is transforming global payments with faster, cheaper cross-border transactions. Trading at $0.5045 , Charting Guy predicts that a bullish breakout could propel XLM’s price target to the $3 to $5 range with its increasing adoption in CBDC initiatives. Its robust use case ensures steady growth. Why RCO Finance Stands Out in the DeFi World RCO Finance has become a game-changer in the decentralized finance, offering tools and features catering to new and experienced users. It simplifies investment management by providing an accessible platform without prior financial knowledge. This approach makes it the best crypto to buy for anyone looking to explore decentralized finance without feeling overwhelmed. The Robo Advisor is one of the platform’s most valuable features. It crafts personalized strategies based on your financial goals, analyzing trends and adjusting recommendations in real-time. Whether you’re cautious or adventurous in your investments, the Robo Advisor works in the background to make informed decisions for you. It’s like having a personal financial coach that never sleeps. To reinforce its credibility, RCO Finance has successfully passed a SolidProof audit . This external verification ensures the platform is secure and transparent, addressing concerns about trust in the crypto space. For users, this means peace of mind and confidence in their investments. With these innovations and security measures, RCO Finance is paving the way for a more inclusive and reliable DeFi experience. RCO Finance: The Underdog with Giant Potential To Match the XRP Price Surge RCO Finance is the DeFi coin to watch. At $0.056 in its presale, RCOF combines AI innovation with accessible investment opportunities. With predictions placing it above $3 by 2025, RCOF is a top contender for outsized returns. As the altcoin season nears, HBAR, XLM, and RCOF stand out as the best cryptos to invest in. While each has immense potential, RCOF’s presale prices and innovative edge could deliver the most dramatic gains. Early investors have a chance to see extraordinary returns as a $100 investment has the potential to turn into over $5,000.

In an interview with News.ru , the financial analyst and trader Artem Zvezdin claimed that Trump sanctions on coins like USDT could see Moscow-held tokens “suffer the same fate as Russia’s gold and foreign exchange reserves.” Will Trump Sanction Stablecoin Issuers? Zvezdin noted that billions of USD worth of Russian assets were frozen in the West in 2022 after the outbreak of war in Ukraine. The United States is sanctioning nine individuals and entities connected to the TGR Group, an international network conducting illicit finance on behalf of Russian elites. We remain committed to countering Russian sanctions evasion, including the misuse of virtual assets. — Matthew Miller (@StateDeptSpox) December 4, 2024 The expert said that USD-pegged token issuers could face an unenviable choice: To either unpeg from the dollar or risk being “completely frozen.” Multiple Russian media outlets and experts have hinted that domestic firms use stablecoins to trade with international partners. This helps them evade Western sanctions and also avoids the need to use Bitcoin (BTC) . The Russian Central Bank has previously expressed a disdain for BTC and other “private cryptoassets.” Zvezdin suggested that Trump could respond by “imposing sanctions on companies that are accountable to the US.” “In this case, people who own stablecoins will end up with not even candy wrappers. They will have nothing more than a few numbers on a screen.” Zvezdin Media personality Tucker Carlson says he interviewed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow https://t.co/Bn3dPU6WOi — Bloomberg (@business) December 4, 2024 Peg in Peril? The expert noted that in order to maintain their dollar pegs, companies that issue stablecoins buy US Treasury bonds, stocks, and other traditional financial assets. In this way, he explained, “parity is achieved,” with “one stablecoin equal in value to one dollar.” Sanctions could threaten this equilibrium, he said. Zvezdin added that Washington is “unhappy with the fact that” crypto “is being used to circumvent sanctions.” And he said the US thinks that Moscow and its allies Iran and North Korea all use crypto to make cross-border payments. Trump may also worry that the US dollar “monopoly” could “collapse” due to the growth of crypto-powered international settlements, the expert said. @RobinhoodApp Crypto EU has introduced USDC stablecoin to its platform, providing European users access to a secure, regulated, dollar-backed digital asset. #Crypto #Robinhood #Circle https://t.co/4RIo5FhJ7G — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 28, 2024 Crypto adoption is on the rise in Russia.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

If TON maintains its trajectory, it could break the resistance of $7.198 and target the $8 level in December. However, a reversal could test support levels at $6.6 and $5.6. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for TON nearly touched the overbought threshold of 70 before pulling back to its current level of 63. This suggests that while the buying momentum has weakened slightly, it remains relatively strong, indicating that buyers maintain a slight edge. If the RSI climbs back above 70, as it did in could regain momentum and test levels above $7.2, signaling another bullish breakout. Additionally, the supply of TON on exchanges has decreased to 1.68 million, down from 1.75 million on December 1. This significant outflow suggests reduced selling pressure and a possible shift to long-term holding or staking, which could support the upward price trend as selling liquidity dries up. For trts an opportunity to capitalize on TON’s bullish momentum. Monitoring key resistance and support levels, along with technical indicators like the RSI and EMAs, can provide insights into potential entry and exit points. Staying informed about market trends and on-chain metrics is crucial for making infoions. Fantom (FTM): A Surge Toward New Heights Fantom (FTM) has been on a roll, delivering an 85% price surge after rebounding from a low of $0.64. Its current trajectory has analysts buzzing, with predictions of a push toward $1.68 in the coming weeks. This growth is fueled by strong technical indicators and increasing adoption within its ecosystem. Fantom’s unique Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture sets it apart, offering speed and scalability that traditional blockchains can’t match. Developers and users are flocking to Fantom because of its low transaction costs and lightning-fast confirmation times. Projects built on Fantom’s platform are gaining traction, from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to gaming and NFT marketplaces. This activity isn’t just hype—it’s creating real value and driving up demand for FTM tokens. As of now, FTM is trading around $1.32, showing robust momentum. Analysts believe breaking above the $1.50 resistance level could pave the way for a rally to $1.68 and beyond. For those seeking the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, Fantom is an exciting choice with a proven track record of innovation and adoption.

37271028,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51447,1733451357,"Qubetics Reaches $4.4 Million in Presale, Turning Heads, While Cronos and EOS Show Volatility","What if the altcoins you’re buying today could define your financial future? Cronos is climbing charts, promising lucrative gains, while EOS battles a market dip, raising questions about its resilience. Amid this, Qubetics has emerged as a game-changer, offering innovative solutions and attracting over 6,500 holders with a staggering $4.4 million raised during its presale. While Cronos and EOS battle market volatility, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out by addressing real-world challenges with its revolutionary non-custodial wallet—a feature traditional systems have failed to perfect. With a mainnet launch on the horizon and predictions of $10-15 per token, Qubetics is turning skeptics into believers. Let’s dive into how these three altcoins stack up and why they’re the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Qubetics: Pioneering Financial Autonomy with Its Non-Custodial Wallet In a world where crypto wallets often compromise privacy and control, Qubetics flips the narrative. The project’s non-custodial wallet promises users full autonomy over their finances—no middlemen, no restrictions, just seamless access to your assets. Custodial wallets are prime targets for hackers. High-profile breaches, like the Mt. Gox hack that cost investors over $450 million, highlight this vulnerability. By eliminating third-party control, Qubetics ensures your assets remain yours—always. Custodial wallets often require extensive KYC protocols, exposing sensitive personal data. Qubetics’ decentralised model prioritises anonymity, offering a secure haven for users who value privacy. Centralised systems impose restrictions on transactions, particularly in regions with stringent regulations. Qubetics empowers users by removing these barriers, making global financial inclusion a reality. For more information, watch this video . Presale Numbers and Predictions The buzz around Qubetics is undeniable. With over 270 million $TICS tokens sold at $0.0282 each and a presale tally exceeding $4.4 million, it’s clear investors see immense potential. Analysts predict the token could reach $10-15 post-mainnet launch, making it a prime contender among the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. Cronos: On the Rise with Promising Upside Potential Cronos ($CRO) has been making waves, recently gaining attention for its upside potential. Analysts suggest the token could climb 31% to reach its next target, driven by growing adoption and strategic partnerships. Cronos is more than just a token; it’s a comprehensive ecosystem designed to support DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. The network’s interoperability with Ethereum and Cosmos gives it a competitive edge, enabling seamless integration across blockchain platforms. Despite market fluctuations, Cronos has shown resilience. Recent reports highlight its potential for significant gains, especially as the ecosystem attracts more developers and projects. At its current price, investors see it as a golden opportunity among the best altcoins to buy in December 2024. However, like any altcoin, Cronos isn’t immune to risks. The token’s performance hinges on broader market trends and the success of its ongoing developments. Still, for those willing to ride the wave, it’s an enticing prospect. EOS: A Contender Facing Market Challenges EOS has long been hailed as a blockchain with groundbreaking scalability and speed, but 2024 hasn’t been kind. Recent reports show a 10% dip, leading some to question its stability. While EOS faces challenges, its robust technology cannot be ignored. The platform’s Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) model allows for faster transactions and lower fees, making it an attractive option for developers and enterprises. However, competition from newer, more versatile blockchains has put EOS in a tough spot. For EOS to reclaim its status as one of the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, it must adapt. The community’s push for updates and strategic partnerships could reignite interest, but for now, cautious optimism is the name of the game. Investors should keep a close eye on market movements and project developments. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out If you’re looking for the best altcoins to buy in December 2024, Qubetics, Cronos, and EOS should be on your radar. Qubetics, with its groundbreaking innovations and $10-15 price prediction, leads the pack. Cronos offers promising gains, while EOS holds potential despite its challenges. The clock is ticking, and opportunities like this don’t last forever. Dive into Qubetics’ presale , explore Cronos, and keep an eye on EOS. Your next big crypto win could be just around the corner.

37270950,https://nulltx.com/?p=135292,1733451335,"Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024: Qubetics, Chainlink, and Cronos Lead the Pack","Why Qubetics Could Be the Best Crypto Investment of December 2024: A Deep Dive into Its Potential Alongside Chainlink and Cronos Cryptocurrency has been the talk of the town lately, and it’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum anymore. New projects and existing powerhouses are shaking up the scene. Did you catch the news about the PGA Tour teaming up with LIV Golf for a massive $10 million prize paid entirely in Cronos (CRO)? Or Chainlink’s big play with Fortlake Asset Management, where they’re revolutionizing fund tokenization? These developments aren’t just headlines—they’re paving the way for crypto adoption across industries. But wait—there’s more. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), the new kid on the block with game-changing features that promise to simplify digital payments like never before. Qubetics isn’t here to just exist; it’s solving problems that others haven’t cracked. From a non-custodial wallet with seamless integration into Apple Pay and Google Pay to a “No KYC” process, Qubetics is shaping up to be a real contender. The project is currently in Presale Phase 11, with tokens priced at $0.0282. With over 6,500 holders and $4.4M raised, it’s easy to see why early investors are calling it a golden opportunity. Let’s break it all down and see how Qubetics compares to big names like Chainlink and Cronos. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Everyday Crypto Payments Imagine this: you’re at your local coffee shop, and instead of fumbling through your wallet or scanning QR codes for crypto payments, you just tap your phone. That’s the vision Qubetics is bringing to life with its non-custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. The wallet integrates with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and desktop platforms, making crypto transactions feel as simple as swiping your debit card. What’s even cooler? The smart contract conversion mechanism. It converts crypto into fiat at the point of sale, so you don’t have to worry about wild price swings. Here’s the kicker: Qubetics is focused on privacy. Their No KYC (Know Your Customer) feature ensures you can manage your assets without the hassle of uploading personal data. This is perfect for freelancers juggling international clients or small businesses tired of currency conversion fees. For instance, a small café could accept crypto payments without worrying about market volatility—it’s all converted to stable fiat instantly. As of now, 1 $TICS token is $0.0282, but don’t sleep on it. With weekly 10% price hikes during presale, this is a get-in-early moment. After the presale, prices are projected to hit $0.25, offering an impressive 900% ROI. So far, over 270M tokens have been sold. Qubetics isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement aiming to make crypto payments part of everyday life. Chainlink (LINK): Connecting the Blockchain Dots If you’ve been around crypto for a minute, you know Chainlink is the OG of connecting real-world data to blockchain networks. Lately, it’s been making moves with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which simplifies the transfer of tokens and data across different blockchains. Think of it like a universal translator, but for blockchains. This innovation is clutch in a world that’s becoming more interconnected. Chainlink isn’t stopping there. They’ve teamed up with Avalanche to launch low-latency Data Streams, powering GMX V2’s decentralized markets on both Arbitrum and Avalanche. These markets are already pulling in $50 billion in trading volume, and Chainlink is right in the middle of it all. And let’s not forget the numbers. As of now, Chainlink is trading at $23.63, with analysts predicting further upside as adoption grows. With Fortlake Asset Management tapping Chainlink for fund tokenization, traditional finance is finally catching up to blockchain tech. This makes Chainlink one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, especially for long-term growth. Cronos (CRO): The Backbone of Crypto.com Cronos, the native token of Crypto.com, is quietly becoming a heavy hitter. With the announcement of the Crypto.com Showdown, where a $10 million prize will be paid entirely in CRO, it’s clear that Cronos is stepping into the limelight. This isn’t just a token—it’s an ecosystem, and it’s expanding fast. One of the standout developments is the launch of the Cronos zkEVM network. This zero-knowledge layer 2 network is all about speed and scalability, offering gasless transactions and a system secured by Ethereum. Translation? Cronos is solving the scalability issues that have plagued blockchain for years. Currently, CRO is trading at $0.208846, with potential for major growth as adoption increases. With partnerships across industries and a strong push for real-world use cases, Cronos isn’t just riding the wave—it’s making its own. Add this to your list of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, and you won’t regret it. Conclusion So, where should you park your crypto dollars this month? Based on the latest research, Qubetics ($TICS), Chainlink (LINK), and Cronos (CRO) are your top picks. Qubetics is redefining crypto payments with its non-custodial wallet and “No KYC” process. Chainlink is bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world data, while Cronos is expanding its ecosystem with groundbreaking technologies. Whether you’re an everyday user or a serious investor, these three projects offer something unique. Don’t wait too long—opportunities like these don’t stick around forever. Ready to dive in?

Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution, has successfully performed 2 billion transactions in a mere four hours, surpassing Visa’s daily volume. This marks a historic day for Cardano, marking not only its technical prowess but also a strong contender in DeFi. Related Reading: Cardano Rally Heats Up: Experts See 750% Jump Ahead Cardano: Outperforming Visa And Solana Cardano now has an advantage over big competitors thanks to Hydra’s success. Visa, recognized for its efficiency, handles approximately 0.72 billion transactions per day—less than half of what Hydra accomplished in a fraction of the time. Meanwhile, Cardano’s network has been processing over 9,900 transactions per second, surpassing Solana in transaction speed and confirming its image as a highly scalable blockchain technology. JUST IN: Cardano $ADA has crossed 9,900 transactions per second surpassing Solana. pic.twitter.com/bAOJCOraMl — TapTools (@TapTools) December 2, 2024 Investors’ interest has also risen. ADA, Cardano’s native coin, just recaptured the $1 price despite the issue of 36.84 million tokens. Another projected unlock of $21.3 million worth of ADA represents only 0.05% of the circulating supply, implying that the influence on market dynamics may be modest. Nonetheless, Cardano’s ecosystem remains resilient, because of an emphasis on efficiency and innovation. Hoskinson’s Pride And Community Optimism Input Output’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, is elated on the latest development. In a social media post commemorating Hydra’s milestone, he wrote, “Hydra hit a million. Guess we were right.” His satisfaction in Cardano’s accomplishments reflects the community’s confidence. Many people believe that Hydra’s capacity to execute enormous transaction volumes while lowering fees puts Cardano at the forefront of blockchain scalability. Hydra hit a million. Guess we were right https://t.co/uff9GusWyo — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 4, 2024 This optimism also applies to ADA’s potential price changes. A prominent community member recently stated that the blockchain’s developing DeFi ecosystem and strong emphasis on liquid staking could result in significant growth over the next market cycle. As Cardano continues to attract retail and institutional investors, expectations for ADA’s long-term value remain high. Shaping The Future Of DeFi Hydra’s achievement is more than simply a gain for Cardano; it demonstrates the expanding possibilities of blockchain technology. By outperforming traditional payment systems and other blockchains, Cardano has raised the bar for what is feasible in the DeFi market. Related Reading: No Sweat! Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst As the blockchain industry continues to expand at a rapid pace, Cardano is quickly becoming more than simply a competitor. Recent results for Hydra point to even greater things to come for the platform. ADA’s price, at $1.23, shows a minor decline over the past 24 hours, but the 24.2% increase in the past week emphasizes mounting investor confidence. Cardano’s position on the blockchain is strengthened by Hydra’s capacity to handle billions of transactions in such a short period of time, hence maybe paving the path for more price rise. Driven by both retail and institutional interest, ADA’s value could experience constant increase as Cardano keeps proving its scalability and creativity.

Pudgy Penguins launched three years ago as a set of 8,888 NFTs depicting colorful and comical birds.  Now, the team behind the project tells CoinDesk that they will release a token called PENGU this year on the Solana blockchain.  Nearly a quarter — 23.5% — of the 88 billion PENGU tokens will be reserved for owners of the project's NFT collections like Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, Pudgy Rods and more. A further 22.02% will be available to the Solana and Ethereum communities, while 12.32% are set aside to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges.  ""With $PENGU, the millions of Pudgy Penguin fans and the hundreds of millions of people who see and share the Pudgy Penguin every day now get the opportunity to align themselves with the character and become a part of The Huddle,"" the team shared in a statement. Pudgy is among the rare collections that managed to stay culturally relevant in the otherwise dreadful NFT business following the price crash from the 2021-2022 bull market. Many NFTs lacked real utility beyond being a digital brag. It was also difficult to fully realize gains after price bumps — as market liquidity was often inadequate to fill orders.  The pivot comes as fun tokens and memecoins, unlike NFTs, have taken off and flourished in the last two years. Liquidity, relative cheapness, virality and ease-of-use are key reasons why people have flocked to these latest hot asset classes — even though fun tokens and memecoins fundamentally represent the same idea as NFT collections did: belonging to a passionate community.  Official Pudgy Penguins channels have over 3 million followers across Instagram, X, TikTok and YouTube, and videos involving the characters have notched 32 billion views on Giphy.  One of the brand's TikTok accounts is focused on spreading good vibes under the ""Pudgy Kindness"" moniker — popularizing it as a feel-good service in the mainstream, outside of crypto circles.  It goes beyond screens too. Parent company Igloo last year introduced Pudgy Toys, a toy line based on the digital art collection, and has since sold more than $10 million in collectible igloos and plushies that are carried at major retailers, including Walmart, Target, Amazon and Walgreens.  Pudgy Penguins is the third-largest NFT collection by market capitalization — $550 million in total — as of Thursday, data shows, trailing only CryptoPunks and Bored Apes Yacht Club. The collection came to life in 2021, and each penguin is hand-drawn and features various distinct traits such as backgrounds, body, face, head and skin.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/05/top-nft-brand-pudgy-penguins-to-release-pengu-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9936a2642fddd1b7c9f98d315d0363e2979402bf-1500x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/doge-christmas-dogechris-solana-memecoin-to-explode-15000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-bonk-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The Altcoin Season Index recently hit 86/100, signaling that smaller assets are outshining Bitcoin in performance. $ HBAR , $XRP, and Solana ($ SOL ) have led the charge, fueled by institutional interest, explosive parabolic moves, and ETF speculation. $ XRP , the original institutional darling, and XLM, its younger sibling, have become focal points for investors. Both share striking similarities: founders, bear-market scars, and ETF hopes, but their paths are diverging. Let’s dissect what makes these assets tick, and more importantly, whether they’re worth the hype—or just the latest victims of “chasing the pump.” Fundamentals: Story of Strengths and Weaknesses XRP’s Institutional Edge XRP has come a long way since its fight with the SEC. Now cleared, it’s riding on institutional narratives, with Ripple expanding its ecosystem by introducing its $RLUSD stablecoin. Institutions may soon get access via a spot ETF in early 2025 (pending SEC approval). These factors scream adoption potential, but there’s a darker side. Ripple still holds tens of billions of XRP, leading to inflationary pressure. This centralization raises questions: will institutions trust an asset so tightly controlled? And privacy concerns linger—something institutions care deeply about. XLM: A Grassroots Underdog XLM, once overshadowed by XRP, differentiates itself with a more decentralized vibe. Its 50% token burn in 2019 reduced supply drastically, giving it a more deflationary edge. However, its trading volume is 50% lower than XRP, and its network hasn’t seen the same explosive adoption narrative. Both assets seem poised for institutional adoption, but their tokenomics and growth models diverge significantly. XRP rides institutional coattails; XLM thrives on grassroots utility. Technicals: Reading the Charts XRP’s Parabolic Surge XRP’s 280%+ November gain has pushed it into overbought RSI levels unseen since the 2021 bull market peak. On the daily chart, RSI is above 80, while the weekly RSI washitting historic extremes—a sign of overextension. But this parabolic move doesn’t mean it’s game over. Let’s talk buy-the-dip zones—or more realistically, buy-the-dip zones, not levels. Here’s what stands out: 1. $2.29 (Fib 0.382): The first retracement area from the local top. Confluences with horizontal resistance turned support. 2. $1.91 (Fib 0.618): A deeper retracement, backed by the 50-day moving average and sitting below a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $1.96-$2.20. 3. $1.63 (Fib 0.786): Major multi-cycle support with a weekly confluence. 4. $1.28: The last low before November’s parabolic surge—a critical test of XRP’s strength. XLM’s Mirror Reflection XLM followed XRP’s November run with a 450% + gain. Its weekly chart shows similarities, but RSI levels are less extreme. $0.414 is a critical pivot point—lose it, and the sell-off could accelerate. The 200-week moving average is catching up, suggesting a potential safety net for long-term bulls. Altcoin Season Context The Altcoin Season Index at 86/100 confirms what we’ve seen: altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin as market dominance shifts. However, this often comes with risks. Historically, strong altcoin rallies like this tend to precede sharp corrections. XRP and XLM, despite their gains, may be entering a distribution phase—a period when early buyers lock in profits, leaving new entrants to bear the risk. Source: coinmarketcap.com Summary: Timing the Market XRP and XLM are undeniably similar in history but vastly different in fundamentals. XRP’s centralized narrative contrasts with XLM’s grassroots approach, but both face headwinds of overextension, high market caps ($130 billion for XRP, $14.5 billion for XLM), and a “sell-the-news” backdrop. The best time to buy was during accumulation at $0.30 or $0.55, not after 300%-400% gains. The second best strategy? Patience. Don’t chase pumps; wait for discounts. As the saying goes: “Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered.” Buying into overbought RSI levels is a gamble, especially when macro conditions remain uncertain. With the DXY stabilizing and equity markets under pressure (Nasdaq and S&P500 are flatlining), December could bring the answers we need.

37269903,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623551,1733448136,Bitcoin’s aggressive $100K rise will bring out the ‘Holiday Effect’,"Bitcoin’s recent $100k milestone has many speculating about the timing. While Q4 is generally a bullish quarter, the surge in Bitcoin’s price reportedly came on the back of increased institutional demand and strong buying activity from the US. Buying pressure coincides with the holiday season, which may enhance market euphoria due to the “Holiday Effect.” Will the phenomenon intensify BTC price before 2024 ends? Bitcoin could hit another record high before year-end Bitcoin price surpassed $100k on December 4 for the first time, leading to celebrations within the crypto community. Bitcoin maintained the range before dropping under the crucial level on December 5. According to CryptoQuant data, the rise was on the back of 2 things : institutional demand and sustained buying by US investors. Bitcoin passes $100k as institutional demand drives the market. The Coinbase Premium Index highlights sustained buying pressure from U.S. investors. pic.twitter.com/eZvKFCmVxs — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 5, 2024 At the time of writing, CoinGecko notes Bitcoin’s 24-hour range between $92,900 and $103,600. However, there is one reason to be optimistic that BTC will break the upper band due to the ‘Holiday Effect.’ Research has shown that returns are generally higher around the holidays and this phenomenon is called the Holiday Effect. Bitcoin’s $100k peak comes squished between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Papers cite that investor buying is because of “holiday euphoria” during this period. But , it is also likely that not all investors would participate in the market during this time. Considering it is also a festive time to spend with families or on vacations. Therefore, despite uncertainty about the trading volumes, stocks have seen the Holiday Effect. This also means, that if Bitcoin follows a similar trajectory, another record peak could be achieved before 2024 concludes. Bitcoin demand is a positive indicator What is noteworthy is that retail demand for Bitcoin is already on the rise since 2020. CryptoQuant research finds that the 30-day demand change from retail investors is currently at a record high. The reason is simple—retail investments could be backed by institutional trust. And the latter could be playing a role in the former. Bitcoin 30-day retail demand | Source: CryptoQuant The research shows that there is high demand even as long-term holders are selling to take profits. The report says, “Historically, increased retail participation has often signaled a potential local top.” This essentially means that when a lot of everyday investors jump in, it can signal that Bitcoin’s price is nearing a short-term peak. However, this surge also shows more people are getting involved, which can boost overall market activity, the research suggests. The research underlined 2 potential scenarios . One where Bitcoin price moves sideways, as retail enthusiasm cools off. Second was if Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 mark. And since it did, the prediction is of another wave of excitement, potentially leading to a “euphoric” market phase where prices climb quickly. The key is to watch how retail and institutional investors interact as it is about long-term adoption. Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO of Pi42, told Cryptopolitan, “It [ $100k milestone] comes in a year that has seen Bitcoin more than double, including a 45-percent advance in less than four weeks following Trump’s presidential victory.” Shekhar also reminds us that it has been 16 years since Bitcoin’s creation and signals “mainstream adoption.” Sumit Gupta, co-founder of crypto exchange CoinDCX, believes that the $100k mark is not a number but a “psychological breakthrough.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoins-aggressive-100k-rise-will-bring-out-the-holiday-effect/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37269903.jpeg

This stabilization comes after a period of downward pressure, raising speculations of a rebound on the horizon. With bulls showing signs of resilience, the stage is set for a comeback that could redefine BONK’s near-term trajectory. Will this level be the springboard for a recovery, or is further consolidation needed before the next move? Support Holds Steady: Signs Of A Bullish Rebound As market sentiment teeters between caution and optimism, determining the meme coin’s recent hold at the $0.00004002 support level is crucial in order for investors and traders to reevaluate their positions ahead of potential volatility. Related Reading: BONK Jumps 20% As ‘Dog Season’ Starts, Analyst Says On the 4-hour chart, BONK is exhibiting a steady upward trajectory despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). After rebounding strongly from the critical $0.00004002 support level, the asset is making strides to extend its gains, aiming toward the $0.00006247 resistance zone. A successful breach above the 100-day SMA could further validate its recovery, possibly opening the door to higher levels. Also, the formation of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a resurgence in buying pressure and a shift toward a more bullish market sentiment. When the RSI rises and reaches 50%, it could confirm its upside movement, giving BONK the strength to push higher and test key resistance levels. BONK Performance On The Daily Time Frame BONK is showing signs of a potential upward movement on the daily chart, staying above the 100-day SMA after a rebound at the $0.00004002 support level. Its maintenance above this support provides a foundation for further growth. If BONK can maintain its position above this level and continue building momentum, it could pave the way for a breakout and more upside movement. Furthermore, the daily RSI shows signs of a rebound, maintaining a steady position above the 50% threshold. The continued trend above this level implies that the asset is in a favorable position for more gains, with the possibility of a sustained rally. Should the RSI continue to climb, it could indicate growing confidence among traders and signal positive price action for the meme coin. Related Reading: Is BONK Rally In Jeopardy? Technical Indicators Confirm Weakness Thus far, BONK is at a pivotal moment, having found stability above the $0.00004002 support level and the daily 100-day SMA. If Bonk can sustain its position above this support and build on its current momentum, a potential recovery could be underway, possibly driving the price toward the $0.00006247 resistance level and beyond. Nonetheless, failure to maintain $0.00004002 may alter the meme coin’s direction to the downside, causing it to retest lower support zones such as $0.00002962 and $0.00002320.

Creditcoin will lay the financial groundwork to create a blockchain-based ecosystem conducive to secure lending and borrowing. Spacecoin, on the other hand, focuses on connectivity by deploying advanced satellite technology to deliver internet access to underserved regions. Sui, a smart contract platform, is responsible for scalable and secure computing, while Walrus ensures efficient data management and decentralized storage availability. How Creditcoin, Spacecoin, Sui, and Walrus can work together Together, all parties can work on delivering a cohesive system and tackle challenges such as the lack of internet access and limited financial inclusion in certain areas. As mentioned, Spacecoin’s satellite network will provide connectivity in regions where the necessary infrastructure is lacking, allowing Creditcoin users worldwide to execute transactions more safely. In the meanwhile, Sui and Walrus scalability solutions are expected to streamline peer-to-peer ( P2P ) financial interactions and data sharing without centralized intermediaries. Most importantly, the P2P module is expected to reduce operational costs and enhance transparency in the process. As such, the partnership aims to address the needs of the 37% of the global population that remains offline and/or underbanked. New global avenues in DeFi By integrating connectivity with DeFi solutions, the partnership opens up new avenues for potential clients in remote regions. New users will thus gain access to financial services and manage their assets online, fostering inclusivity and economic growth.

37268995,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623056,1733445480,Could This Cutting-Edge Coin Transform Blockchain Forever? Here’s What to Watch For,"Blockchain technology is evolving at lightning speed, and with it comes a wave of groundbreaking innovations. If you’ve been keeping an eye on the crypto world lately, one name might already be buzzing on your radar— Lightchain AI . This isn’t just another blockchain project vying for attention. With its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain AI promises to merge the boundless possibilities of blockchain with the unparalleled power of AI. But can it transform blockchain forever? Let’s dig into what makes this cutting-edge coin so intriguing. Why Investors Can’t Stop Talking About Lightchain AI Lightchain AI has emerged as a beacon of innovation in the crowded crypto space. Here’s why investors, crypto enthusiasts, and tech pioneers are excited about its potential to transform the future of decentralized systems. 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A Game-Changing Consensus Mechanism Most blockchain systems rely on traditional consensus models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). While effective, these systems demand significant energy or financial commitments to validate transactions. Enter Proof of Intelligence (PoI) . Unlike PoW or PoS, PoI incentivizes nodes to perform valuable computational AI tasks, such as training machine learning models or enhancing algorithms, while still maintaining the integrity and security of the network. This means Lightchain AI doesn’t just reward for validation—it pushes the boundaries of what a blockchain can achieve by tapping into the growing demand for advanced AI computations. 2. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Redefining Decentralized Applications At the heart of Lightchain AI ‘s innovation lies its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) . Think of it as a powerful computational brain designed to supercharge decentralized applications (dApps). Where traditional virtual machines are limited by static capabilities, the AIVM is dynamic and adaptable. It allows developers to seamlessly execute AI-driven tasks, from processing natural language data to running predictive analytics—all within a decentralized framework. The result? Smarter, more efficient applications that bring real-world AI power to blockchain technology. 3. A Transparent and Community-Driven Ecosystem Blockchain’s ethos has always been rooted in transparency and decentralization. Lightchain AI takes this to the next level with its Transparent AI Framework . Every decision made by its AI systems is auditable, fostering trust and accountability—a crucial factor for attracting institutional investors and enterprises. What’s more, Lightchain AI integrates decentralized governance, empowering token holders to propose and vote on key initiatives. Imagine having a say in the future of the very protocol you’re invested in—it’s not just about financial returns anymore; it’s about creating a lasting impact. The Lightchain AI Roadmap to Success Any project with bold claims needs a solid plan. Thankfully, Lightchain AI has a well-thought-out roadmap to guide its goals. Phase 1: Prototype Development Bringing the vision to life with early-stage development of PoI, AIVM, and the governance framework while building initial community support. Phase 2: Testnet Deployment Launching a test environment to fine-tune performance, gather user feedback, and ensure scalability. Phase 3: Mainnet Launch The big moment—fully activating the PoI and AIVM for widespread adoption, while simultaneously onboarding validators and expanding partnerships. With $1,063,817.84 already raised in its presale and a current price of just $0.003 per token, Lightchain AI is steadily building momentum. Why Lightchain AI Might Be the Future of Blockchain The intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting frontiers in tech, and Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a leader in this space. Its ability to fuse AI computations with decentralized infrastructure has massive implications for industries like finance, healthcare, supply chain, and more. Here’s why it stands out: Efficiency: PoI ensures resources are used for meaningful tasks, reducing waste and boosting productivity. Scalability: With AIVM at its core, Lightchain AI enables dApps to tackle increasingly complex AI operations. Impact: By making its AI systems transparent and accountable, Lightchain AI builds trust for enterprise-level adoption. But What About Risks? Like any innovative concept, Lightchain AI isn’t without its risks. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, and investor returns can never be guaranteed. Additionally, as a cutting-edge project, Lightchain AI relies heavily on adoption and execution to fully realize its potential. That said, the team’s focus on usability and community-driven governance indicates strong fundamentals, which could make it a promising investment for long-term crypto enthusiasts. How to Get Involved with Lightchain AI You don’t have to wait for the official launch to be a part of this revolution.

On Dec. 4, Kraken released its Crypto FOMO Survey 2024 , examining the impact of fear of missing out (FOMO) and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) on U.S. crypto holders’ investment decisions. The survey polled 1,248 participants, revealing how emotions influence their approach to digital assets. Investors Feel They Missed the Boat A significant portion of respondents expressed regret over missed opportunities. Kraken reported that 88% of survey participants believe they’ve lost out on major gains. This sentiment has been fueled by Bitcoin’s rally, which saw BTC hit the $100,000 mark on Dec. 5 for the first time. Bitcoin has surged 126% since January, driving the broader crypto market. Altcoins have also seen substantial growth. XRP recently overtook Solana and Tether to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite feelings of missed opportunities, 84% of respondents remain optimistic about future crypto gains. Emotions Influence Decisions When asked about their greatest concerns, 60% cited sudden price surges as the biggest missed opportunity. Additionally, 81% admitted making investment decisions based on FUD, while 84% said they acted on FOMO during price spikes. The survey also revealed that 63% of participants believe emotional decisions have negatively impacted their portfolios. A Methodical Approach is Key While market sentiment plays a role in investment decisions, Kraken emphasized the importance of a calculated strategy. The exchange recommends leveraging technical analysis and planned trading strategies to navigate the volatile crypto market.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-rescues-usa-trumpusa-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

As December 2024 unfolds, a new wave of meme coins is here, sparking both curiosity and FOMO among crypto enthusiasts. What makes this month particularly special? It’s all about the coins that mix cheeky charm with serious growth potential. BTFD , Notcoin, and Memecoin are the headline-makers right now, each bringing a unique spin to the meme coin space. Whether you’re after explosive presales, viral campaigns, or chaotic unpredictability, these coins have something for everyone. Let’s dive into why they’re being hailed as the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BFTD: The Veteran Making Waves Again BFTD, short for “ Buy The F***ing Dip ,” stands out as a meme coin that has managed to balance its playful identity with meaningful innovation. In December 2024, BFTD has cemented its reputation as more than just a meme—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem offering significant value to its community. Investors are drawn not just by the meme culture but also by its ecosystem that includes P2E gaming, staking rewards, and a strong utility-first approach. Currently trading at $0.000064 in Stage 7 , BFTD’s presale has already raised over $1 million, selling more than 23 billion tokens. With a listing price set at $0.0006, early investors stand to gain returns of over 800%. For example, an investment of $5,000 now could fetch approximately 78,203,125 tokens. When BFTD hits its listing price, that investment could grow to $46,921—a compelling reason why it’s hailed as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024 . The excitement doesn’t stop there. BFTD’s partnership with gaming platforms and its reward-driven ecosystem are key factors in its rising popularity. With over 2,400 holders and counting, BFTD is not just a meme coin but a movement. Its potential to rival the meme coin giants of the past makes it a must-watch this month. Notcoin: The Meme Coin with a Mission NOTCOIN takes meme culture to the next level by parodying the very concept of cryptocurrency. Its tagline, “This Is Not a Coin,” has sparked a wave of curiosity, turning it into a viral sensation. But behind its ironic branding lies a serious project that’s making waves in the crypto community. At its core, NOTCOIN is about decentralised governance. The coin’s holders vote on key project decisions, making it one of the most community-driven meme coins on the market. Its DAO structure is a refreshing departure from the typical top-down approach seen in many crypto projects. This unique governance model has earned NOTCOIN a dedicated following, cementing its place among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. . NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns are unmatched. Its recent stunt involving a billboard in Times Square that simply said “This Is Not a Coin” generated millions of impressions online. This kind of marketing, paired with its innovative features, is driving adoption at a rapid pace. At its current price of $0.00009, analysts predict it could reach $0.001 by mid-2025, making it a high-potential investment for those looking to ride the meme coin wave. NOTCOIN is also making strides in utility. It recently announced a partnership with a major social media platform to integrate tipping using NOTCOIN, bringing real-world use cases to its holders. Whether it’s for fun, governance, or potential profit, NOTCOIN offers something for every kind of investor. Memecoin: The Wild Card of December 2024 Memecoin is the wildcard in this month’s meme coin race. While its name might seem generic, its approach is anything but. MEMECOIN thrives on unpredictability, using its lack of a strict roadmap as a marketing tactic. This “no-plan plan” approach has drawn in risk-tolerant investors who thrive on chaos. The coin’s recent rise in popularity is fuelled by its outrageous marketing stunts and viral memes that capture the internet’s ever-changing zeitgeist. At its current price of $0.00005, MEMECOIN’s low entry point makes it an attractive option for new investors. While its long-term viability is uncertain, its potential for explosive short-term gains is undeniable. Many see it as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., purely for its entertainment value and speculative potential. Conclusion The world of meme coins is as dynamic as it is unpredictable, but one thing is clear: December 2024 belongs to BTFD and NOTCOIN. These two projects bring a mix of humour, utility, and community-driven energy that sets them apart. MEMECOIN adds an element of wild unpredictability to the mix, making it a must-watch for risk-takers. If you’re searching for the best meme coins to invest in December 2024., BTFD’s utility-rich ecosystem and NOTCOIN’s viral campaigns and governance model make them standout choices. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on these high-potential projects.
