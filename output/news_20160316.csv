42426711,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Zh,1458164154,Energy and Commerce Committee Talks Bitcoin in Congressional Hearing,"The US House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade held a meeting on digital currencies and blockchain technology today, exploring the technology's characteristics as well as its regulatory and legislative implications.  The panel of experts at the meeting included Circle CCO John Beccia; Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito; IBM vice president of blockchain technologies Jerry Cuomo; Factom chief architect Paul Snow; BuckleySandler LLP counsel Dana Syracuse; Coinbase counsel Juan Suarez; and Bloq co-founder Matt Roszak.  Opening statements largely focused on the fundamentals of bitcoin and the blockchain, offering a look at the current makeup of the startup ecosystem as well as a take on the existing regulatory environment.  Overall, the hearing had an introductory tone, as it is meant to serve as part of a series on technology disruption that in the past few months has also featured mobile payments, 3-D printing and drones.  Representative Michael Burgess, chairman of the subcommittee, cast a wide net in his opening, remarking on how some state legislatures have moved in the past year to cement their own regulatory approaches to the technology and consider how the technology could be applied to government itself.  Burgess stated:  ""We will hear about what consumers can do today with digital currency, we're also hear about consumer protections. Even more exciting is the potential for consumer benefits to be realized by firms that utilize the blockchain.""  The US House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade is part of the Energy and Commerce Committee.  Range of questions  Indeed, many of the questions echoed those brought up in legislative hearings on digital currencies in the past, such as the question of privacy and anonymity on the bitcoin blockchain, perceptions that digital currencies are being used to finance terrorism, and the often-discussed volatility in bitcoin markets.  On the last point, Roszak argued – and others concurred – that the bitcoin market is still in its early stages, and as a result is subject to the forces of supply and demand as well as significant speculation.  ""We’re at the front end of this,"" he said.  Consumer protection was also a notable subject during the hearing, with Illinois Rep. Janice Schakowsky asking whether bitcoin users can try to reverse a transaction after buying a defective product.  This sparked Syracuse, who previously worked for the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the architects of the New York BitLicense, to cite that regulatory framework as an example of the kinds of consumer protection mechanisms that can be put in place.  ""Under the BitLicense, there are certain enumerated disclosures that need to be made. Disclosures about volatility, disclosures about the irreversibility of a transaction, they have to be made,"" he said.  The meeting concluded with Burgess asking panel members about potential use cases, with micropayments, smart insurance contracts and distributed forms of corporate governance being offered as possible future applications.  Burgess, who at times tried to strike a light-hearted tone during the hearing, closed with a joke:  ""When we had the drones hearing, we had drones here. I was so looking forward to finding out who's face was on the bitcoin, and I still don’t know, even after the end of this hearing.""

42426700,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Hh,1458160960,Bitcoin Startups Stuck in Limbo as BitLicense Process Drags On,"Finalized in June of 2015, New York’s BitLicense regulation was heralded as a potential boon for an industry then struggling to shake its stigma as the unregulated ‘Wild West’ of the financial industry.  More than six months after the deadline for application filings, however, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has yet to emerge as a regular newsmaker in the industry. The NYDFS has only issued one BitLicense under the regulatory framework, which it provided to bitcoin services firm Circle in September 2015.  According to figures provided to CoinDesk by the NYDFS, this means as many as 21 industry startups are now operating under the BitLicense's safe harbor provision, but waiting for a formal confirmation that they are licensed bitcoin services providers in New York.  Even some of the industry’s more well-funded applicants, such as bitcoin exchange Coinbase and bitcoin storage specialist Xapo, indicated that their applications are still being processed.  In conversations with CoinDesk, applicants reported varying degrees of interaction with NYDFS officials, with some indicating they have not been provided much clarity as to the status of their application and others lauding the regulator for its efforts to help them ensure they have provided the requisite details for approval.  A spokesperson for the NYDFS indicated the department is potentially close to awarding new licenses, but that the relatively new nature of the technology is a factor in why more applications have yet to be approved.  NYDFS executive deputy of communications Richard Loconte told CoinDesk:  ""Applicants vary very, very widely, in terms of the type of applicants and information provided. We’re working with many applicants, rather than outright rejecting them, to provide information we need.""  Loconte contrasted this developing process with other licensed sectors, which have established pipelines and a steady stream of applicants. He suggested the high initial number of applications has created a backlog, that he believes will lessen over time.  Startups involved in the application process offered similar remarks, indicating that both sides see eye-to-eye on many current issues.  ""The BitLicense is really the first of its kind, so it's hard to compare this process to that of any other,” Sheffield Clark, managing partner at bitcoin ATM network CoinSource, said.  Application process  Among the companies that publicly indicated they had applied for licenses, most were complimentary when discussing the application process.  Nejc Kodrič, CEO of digital currency exchange Bitstamp, reported to an initial period of silence but said communication has ""not been a problem"".  Elsewhere, Patrick Manasse, chief compliance officer at bitcoin exchange MonetaGo, reported that, while sometimes stressful for all involved, the process is moving forward professionally and with respect on both sides.  ""They could require anything, that every user has to have a blood test. It could be crazy, but they understand that’s not their job,"" Manasse said. ""It’s to help provide a safe and efficient marketplace, and it comes through in the way they’re dealing with companies.""  For example, Manasse said that the NYDFS has allowed MonetaGo to send portions of the application process as they are completed, a development he said helps make the process more accommodating to a startup environment.  Still, applicants wishing to remain anonymous suggested there is some confusion over the state of the filing process, and described the process of providing additional information as a ‘hassle’ for their teams.  In January, Kraken founder Jesse Powell said the cost of a BitLicense wasn't yet worth the benefits of doing business in New York. When Powell's company acquired New York City-based Coinsetter for an undisclosed amount he said the company's pending BitLicense would not transfer, and he had no intention of reapplying.  Some commentators suggested they believe that the lack of approvals is the result of a string of departures from the NYDFS to the private sector.  Loconte, however, dismissed this criticism, stating that he doesn’t believe this slowed down an application process due to the fact that delays in any new process are unavoidable.  ""The team that is in place to handle the applications is the same team, by and large,"" he added. ""I don’t think that slowed down the application process.""  Importance of safe harbor  Others sought to portray wait times for licenses in New York as evidence that the policies the BitLicense enacted are working as designed.  Former deputy general counsel for the NYDFS Dana Syracuse, now counsel at BuckleySandler LLP, for instance, said that the process so far does not differ from traditional money services business (MSB) licenses.  Syracuse said that any perceived delays are likely the result of the back and forth that can be necessary to ensure applicants have provided the NYDFS with all information necessary for the agency to complete and evaluate the submission.  Further, he suggested any delays have been offset by the inclusion of a safe harbor that allows applicants to operate while they await approval.  ""To me, the important part of this story is the fact that the BitLicense contains a safe harbor that said as long as you were in by a set date, you were able to continue operations, and that there was ample warning to pull out of New York,"" he said, adding:  ""I think other state regimes need to have similar language, because the licensing process is something that takes time.""

42426703,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Nh,1458153209,Interdealer Broker ICAP Completes Post-Trade Blockchain Trial,"Interdealer broker ICAP announced today that it has completed an internal blockchain technology trial focused on securities post-trade processes.  ICAP's Post Trade Risk and Information division conducted the test last month, completing it on 26th February, the firm saidhttp://newsroom.icap.com/icaps-post-trade-risk-and-information-division-announces-completion-of-a-blockchain-proof-of-technology/, with blockchain startup Axoni providing the software infrastructure for the trial.  The UK-based firm said that the test involved the use of a multi-asset messaging and matching network called Harmony, from which messages were converted, in real time, to smart contracts built on a blockchain.  ICAP explained:  ""The smart contracts were then distributed to nine representative participant nodes on the blockchain network, where trades were permissioned for additional services such as valuation, compression and reporting.""  The company said that the test results showed how blockchain technology can improve the security and accuracy of data flows in the post-trade environment, as well as cut back-office costs.  ""In successfully completing a proof of technology test, ICAP has demonstrated one of the first real world applications of distributed ledger technology that has the ability to significantly transform the post trade landscape,"" Jenny Knott, CEO of ICAP’s post trade division, said in a statement.  The trial is the latest effort to demonstrate how blockchain tech could be applied to post-trade processes, during which transactions are approved and the assets and cash involved are exchanged between the parties after a trade has taken place.  Firms like Japanese bank Mizuho and regulators such as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have recently conducted work in this area. Last fall, a group of companies including the London Stock Exchange, Société Générale and UBS formed a working group specifically focused on post-trade applications of the technology.

42426695,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Bh,1458145820,Retail Giant Overstock to Issue its Own Stock on Blockchain Platform,"Online retail giant Overstock announced it will issue public shares of company stock on its tØ blockchain platform at the 41st Annual International Futures Industry Conference today.  First unveiled in August 2015, the tØ blockchain platform ambitiously aims to revolutionize trade and settlement by issuing stocks and bonds as a digital, blockchain-based assets, thereby disrupting the T+3 settlement model currently operated by the DTTC.  Following the release, Overstock would have two versions of its stock, one available on traditional trading systems such as Nasdaq and another on tØ. Overstock cryptocurrency group general manager Judd Bagley indicated that its blockchain stock will be traded, settled and recorded “entirely on a decentralized ledger”.  Bagley told CoinDesk:  ""We’ve proved the safety and security of the tech numerous times ... enough for us to be confident in the capacity to make this work and ensure investors that we meet safety and security that SEC demands.""  Bagley pointed to Overstock’s sale of a $5m ""cryptobond"" in July of 2015, a trial that saw both Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne and FNY Managed Accounts, a New York-based trading firm, use the technology to show how financial instruments could be digitized and traded.  For its tØ stock, Bagley said Overstock is using a permissioned ledger to manage shares, but that transactions will be batched and hashed against the bitcoin blockchain for additional transparency.  In total, Overstock will issue 1 million blockchain preferred shares as part of the project, out of a total of 25.29 million shares.  ""We settled on 1 million shares as a number that would provide enough liquidity to prove out this concept,"" Bagley said. ""This stock issuance is not about raising money, this is about proving this technology.""  Dual markets  Notably, the introduction of the blockchain stock would mean that Overstock shares will trade in two separate markets, potentially with two separate values.  For example, Bagley noted that there is no system that pegs the blockchain preferred stock to the traditional shares, meaning traders could trade both assets.  ""We expect that arbitrage opportunities that people will find. If there are pricing discrepancies between blockchain shares and other shares that people will take advantage of that. The values will be determined by the market,"" Bagley said.  Overstock did not provide a timeline for the proposed launch.

42426702,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Lh,1458142823,Australian Delivery Service Exploring Blockchain Identity Solutions,"A major Australian delivery company is looking into possible applications for blockchain technology.  The Australian Financial Review reported today that the government-owned Australia Post, which declared AU$6.4bn (roughly $4.75bn) in 2013-2014 revenue, is currently researching how the technology could be applied in identity services.  ""The future is going to be a digital identity, so that when you say who you are, I can tell who you are,"" Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour said during a business conference in Australia this week hosted by AFR. ""A lot of people are thinking about blockchain from a financial services point of view but the reality is it has much wider applications.""  Fahour went on to say that, given the Australia Post's major role in the country's passport market, a move to offer digital identification services is a natural fit for the company.  The Australia Post isn't the only company in the country to make public its move toward blockchain applications. Late last year, the Australia Securities Exchange (ASX) announced that it was exploring whether it could replace elements of its legacy market infrastructure using blockchain tech.  ASX later invested $19.5m to acquire a 5% in blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings, according to recent financial statements, as part of these efforts.  During the same event at which Fahour spoke, according to AFR, ASX CEO Elmer Funke Kupper argued that the technology could save billions of dollars in processing costs.
