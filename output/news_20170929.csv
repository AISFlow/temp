42379924,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LIfX,1506723345,SEC Charges ICO: US Agency Takes Action Against Alleged Token Scammer,"The SEC has brought what appears to be its first charges against a company utilizing the initial coin offering (ICO) fundraising model.  In a press release issued late today, the U.S. securities regulator charged two companies and their founder, businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy, with violating anti-fraud and registration provisions of federal securities laws.  Allegedly, Zaslavskiy sold cryptocurrencies backed by assets that did not exist in two token sales, one for a project called Diamond Reserve Club World, and the other for an effort called the REcoin Group Foundation, the SEC said.  As evidence of the claims, the SEC said REcoin's ICO was purportedly meant to raise funds for investing in real estate. But while Zaslavskiy told investors that REcoin had a ""team of lawyers, professionals, brokers, and accountants,"" the SEC claims he had not hired any personnel to invest the raised funds.  Further, while he claimed that the company had raised “between $2 million and $4 million” but in fact had only raised $300,000, the regulator said.  Likewise, DRC World was formed after the government ""interfered"" with REcoin, according to a statement attributed to Zaslavskiy and posted on a bitcoin forum on September 11.  According to the SEC, DRC World advertised that it would invest in diamonds, and would provide its investors with discounts for products, but the company did not invest in diamonds or have any business operations.  Both companies and Zaslavskiy’s assets were frozen through an emergency court order by a federal district court in Brooklyn, New York.  Overall, the announcement from the SEC is the latest indication that the agency is paying more attention to the Wild West of ICOs. Earlier this week, the regulator said it had created two new units focused on policing cybercrimes — including violations related to distributed ledger tech and ICOs — and protecting mom-and-pop investors.  The SEC is now looking for the companies to pay penalties in addition to returning all funds raised. In addition, the SEC is looking to prevent Zaslavskiy from participating in any digital securities offerings in the future.  The investigation is ongoing.

42379923,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LIi3,1506720631,IMF's Lagarde: Ignoring Cryptocurrencies 'May Not Be Wise',"The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes that cryptocurrencies may give traditional government-issued ones a ""run for their money.""  Speaking at a conference in London, IMF chief Christine Lagarde told attendees that she thinks ""it may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies.""  Notably, she outlined possible scenarios in which a country – particularly those with ""weak institutions and unstable national currencies"" might actually embrace one more directly.  ""Instead of adopting the currency of another country – such as the U.S. dollar – some of these economies might see a growing use of virtual currencies. Call it dollarization 2.0,"" she said.  One of the driving factors behind that potential evolution would be a shift in consumer preference for new currencies that are ""easier and safer"" than existing ones. That scenario could be further hastened if cryptocurrencies ""actually become more stable,"" she said.  Lagarde went on to say:  ""So in many ways, virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money. The best response by central bankers is to continue running effective monetary policy, while being open to fresh ideas and new demands, as economies evolve.""  That said, Lagarde noted earlier in her speech that such an outcome is, in her view, a distant prospect, saying that cryptocurrencies are ""too volatile, too risky, too energy intensive, and because the underlying technologies are not yet scalable.""  To date, the IMF has advocated a balanced approach on cryptocurrency regulation, voicing that position in a January 2016 staff paper. Lagarde has also voiced support for financial applications of blockchain, a subject that the IMF has explored on an organizational level as well.

Published yesterday, the 2018-2022 Draft Strategy Plan largely focuses on the economic trends that will shape US credit unions, as well as the policy implications that may come about as a result. The growing use of fintech means that ""credit unions are likely to face a range of challenges"" from companies that are advancing products and services in this area.  According to the text, the potential for the wider use of cryptocurrencies is cited as one of the technology factors that could drive change in the way that credit unions do business.  ""The emergence and the increasing importance of digital currencies predicted by many analysts may pose both risks and opportunities to consumers, credit unions, banks and financial regulators,"" the report's authors state, adding later: ""These trends are likely to continue, and even accelerate, through 2022.""  Though the draft doesn't mention it, a number of credit unions in the US have already moved toward exploring how they can apply the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to their own operations.  Last year, a group of institutions unveiled the CU Ledger project, aimed at creating new services built on top of the tech. And just last month, the consortium of more than 50 credit unions revealed their plan to create a credit union service organization, or CUSO, and have since been seeking investors for the venture.

42379926,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LIjJ,1506700800,Swiss Finance Regulator Is 'Investigating ICO Procedures',"Switzerland’s top financial markets regulator is investigating the practices behind an undisclosed number of initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Though it didn't name any specific token sales, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority said today that it is examining ""a number of ICO cases to determine whether regulatory provisions have been breached.""  Specifically, the regulator wants to see whether organizers of ICOs, who sell cryptographic tokens in a bid to bootstrap blockchain networks, have violated any laws around anti-money laundering, securities or collective investment schemes.  FINMA said:  ""Given the close resemblance, in some respects, between ICOs/token-generating events and conventional financial-market transactions, one or more aspects of financial market law may already cover ICO campaigns according to their various models. FINMA is currently looking into a number of different cases.""  That the agency would begin investigating the funding use case in Switzerland is perhaps unsurprising, given the growing number of regulators that have undertaken such actions in recent months. For example, South Korea's government unveiled new measures today to restrict ICOs, stating that token sales run afoul of domestic capital market slaws. That move followed a similar crackdown in China earlier this month.  Yet how the situation in Switzerland will develop remains to be seen. According to FINMA, ICOs are not regulated under Swiss law because they do not have a third-party intermediary and are launched for one own’s platform. However, that does not mean ICOs are completely free from legal obligations, the agency added.  ""Due to the underlying purpose and specific characteristics of ICOs, various links to current regulatory law may exist depending on the structure of the services provided,"" FINMA wrote.

Last month, CoinDesk reported that New York-based money manager VanEck had filed to create the VanEck Vectors Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which would be used to invest in ""U.S. exchange-traded bitcoin-linked derivative instruments...and pooled investment vehicles and exchange-traded products that provide exposure to bitcoin."" It was one of a growing number of efforts to create financial products around the cryptocurrency that offer indirect exposure to investors.  Yet a new letter addressed to the SEC's Division of Investment Management, VanEck assistant general counsel Matthew Babinsky indicates that officials at the agency won't consider reviewing the firm's request because of the nascent state of the derivatives market for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  As a result, VanEck is seeking to pull back (at least for now) the filings it made in August.  The letter explains:  ""The Trust notes that on a call with the Staff on September 20, 2017, the Staff expressed the view that it is the Commission’s policy to not review a registration statement for a fund where the underlying instruments in which the fund intends to primarily invest are not yet available. The Staff requested that the Trust withdraw the Amendment until such time as the underlying instruments in which the Fund intends to primarily invest (i.e., bitcoin futures contracts) become available for investment.""  Babinsky added in the letter that, to date, ""no securities have been sold in connection with the filing.""

42379933,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LIpb,1506691808,Edward Snowden: Zcash Is 'Most Interesting Bitcoin Alternative',"Noted whistleblower Edward Snowden has come out in support of the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash, calling it the ""most interesting alternative"" to bitcoin.  Writing in response to a tweet from technologist Mason Borda which read: ""Zcash is the only altcoin (that i know of) designed and built by professional and academic cryptographers. Hard to ignore,"" Snowden replied, ""Agree.""  He continued:  ""Zcash's privacy tech makes it the most interesting Bitcoin alternative. Bitcoin is great, but ""if it's not private, it's not safe.'""  Snowden is a prominent privacy advocate and is most well known for his massive leak of classified NSA documents in 2013. Asked for his thoughts on monero, a competing private currency, Snowden said it was ""amateur crypto"" and pointed to traceability issues within the tech.  Snowden said that such design errors could put fellow whistleblowers at risk, stating: ""Mistakes happen and have huge consequences for people like me.""  The statements fed into the existing rivalry between the competing currencies. In the resulting flood of Twitter responses, Monero developer Richard Spagni strongly defended his project's technology, while the creator of litecoin, Charlie Lee, stated: “I own Monero but not Zcash”.  Zcash and monero are both geared towards providing privacy for their users, but use different tools to – arguably it seems – achieve the same end result.  While zcash is based on a cryptographic operation called zk-snarks, monero works by obfuscating information with ring signatures and stealth addresses.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash Company, the for-profit entity supporting zcash's development.

42379943,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LIzf,1506691400,Holding Strong? Ether Prices Dip as Korea Bans ICOs,"The ether-US dollar (ETH/USD) exchange rate fell to $278 today, a seeming response to news South Korea is joining the global backlash against the initial coin offering (ICO) funding model.  News hit the wires during the Asian trading session, with word that South Korea's Financial Services Commission would ban ""all forms"" of ICOs echoing out across the global market nearly four weeks after China declared ICOs similarly illegal.  At press time, however, the market response to Korea's news has been more tepid.  Despite the fact that South Korea has emerged as a major driver of trading volume, with news its exchanges will list new cryptocurrencies effectively doubling price, treaction was minimal – ether has held tightly to rangebound trading, hitting a high of $303.75 and a low of $280.59 today.  Following China's ban, ether later extended losses to $200 levels.  Still, over the last two weeks, prices regained poise on speculation that Chinese traders are shifting bases to Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.  Going forward, any announcement from other regional regulators could likely dampen recovery efforts. This means that while ether's rebound from $278 to $297 is encouraging, price action analysis indicates it's not out of the woods yet.  4-hour chart  The chart above shows:  A downside break of the triangle formation. The breakdown was on the back of stronger volumes and indicates the sell-off from the record highs above $390 may have resumed.  The recovery from the low of $278 lacks substance, i.e. volumes dropped.  $307 is strong resistance (confluence of 4-hour 200-MA + former head and shoulders neckline).  View  The recovery from $278 to near $300 levels could be short-lived. A rejection at $300 followed by a break below $278 would open doors for a sell-off to $240 levels.  On the higher side, only an end of the day close above $315 would signal bearish-to-bullish trend change.

The new CEO, Rawdon Adams, takes the helm of the Barbados-based startup just months after it unveiled an ambitious plan to develop a pan-Caribbean settlement network built with blockchain tech. The plan, Bitt said in May, is to create a way to better connect a region with more than a dozen governments, each with their own currency systems.  The startup has also worked with the Central Bank of Barbados on pilot blockchain initiatives.  The appointment of Adams adds heft to the startup's regional plans.

In an announcement today, the regulator confirmed the action, one that follows an amendment to the payment services law that mandated all cryptocurrency exchanges register with authorities by the end of September. Passed in April, the new law established bitcoin as a legal payment method and extrapolated security guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges.  The licensing enforces certain operational requirements for the exchanges, including high standards for cybersecurity, the segregation of customer accounts and the verification of customer identities.  Seventeen applications are still in review, while 12 firms have closed their doors in light of the new regulations.  Local cryptocurrency exchange Quoine – one of the 11 firms to receive a license – said in a press release that it will work alongside regulators ""towards the healthy development of the cryptocurrency industry within Japan and on a global scale.""  An FSA executive said earlier this week that it intended to foster ""sound market development"" by working with the exchanges.  Japan is uniquely proactive in its cryptocurrency regulations. Lawmakers have previously stated that this was driven by the now-notorious collapse of local bitcoin exchange Mt Gox in 2014, which led to the loss of millions of dollars in customer funds.  The news comes at a time of regulatory shifts in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Earlier this month, China issued a blanket ban on fundraising methods involving token sales, or initial coin offerings (ICOs), and local cryptocurrency exchanges have indicated they will cease domestic trading following the ban.  South Korea has also stated ICOs are illegal as of today, as well as tightening the rules for exchanges.

42379940,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LIvt,1506682807,US Bank Regulator Opens Door to National License for Bitcoin Firms,"The acting comptroller of the currency for the U.S. Treasury Department has said he is open to the idea that a new breed of banks might one day conduct business in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  Speaking at an event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Thursday, Keith Noreika, the newly named director of the agency tasked with supervising all national banks, went so far as to state publicly that he foresees a future in which bitcoin companies might be granted ""fintech charters"" – proposed licenses designed to simplify the way startups do businesses across state borders.  Currently, bitcoin companies and traditional money transmitters need to comply with a complicated network of regulatory regimes in all 50 U.S. states, a pain point that industry advocates have argued severely limits startup growth by increasing the cost of market entrance.  But despite being open to crypto businesses applying for charters, Noreika went on to strike a cautious note on their chances of being approved.  He told attendees:  ""I wouldn't be adverse to those people coming in and talking to the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] about how a charter could make sense for them. But that is a long process they'd have to go through, and just because you get in the door doesn't mean you're going to get out the door on the other side.""  A long-time lawyer with a history of working in banking, Noreika was appointed acting comptroller by President Donald Trump in May of this year. In the transition, he inherited the fintech charter proposal from his predecessor, Thomas J. Curry, who last year revealed plans to create a single federal option to act as a kind of substitute for state-by-state money transmitter licenses.  Perhaps appropriately, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency was created in 1863 to help subjugate the state currencies that were then taking root, and to create a national currency in their place.  Mindful of the Federal Reserve's present duties to oversee U.S. currency, Noreika spoke passionately about his willingness to hear innovative ideas, and help create an environment in which they can flourish.  He said:  ""I don't think it's my position as a government official to ever say 'no' to anything, or any idea, of any American who wants to come in and petition the government for a benefit from the government.""  Cautious optimism  Overall, Noreika's comments came after hours of discussion in which panels were devoid of any mention of cryptocurrency or blockchain technology. But that would all change immediately after his talk, when the results of three research papers on the subject were presented.  Sharing Noreika's cautious optimism was Evangelos Benos, a senior economist at the Bank of England, the U.K.'s central bank, who discussed his paper published last month entitled, ""The economics of distributed ledger technology for securities settlement.""  During his address, Benos recounted what he argued are the benefits of how securities settlement platforms could utilize distributed ledgers. In summary, he stated that while the initial costs to bring the concept to life might be high, the potential scale of the platforms created could be massive.  ""Their cost-functions are likely very small, or potentially zero,"" he said, adding:  ""Which means that their average costs are going to be declining. Which I think is an important point, because it suggests that potentially, there's no economic limits to the size of this security settlement network.""  'Hot potato'  But not everyone was so optimistic. One particularly bearish analysis of bitcoin came from a representative of the Federal Reserve itself.  The author of ""The Law of One Bitcoin Price,"" published earlier this year,Asani Sarkar, an assistant vice president of research and statistics at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, recounted data that he said successfully shows the limitations of cryptocurrency.  Specifically, he argued that, while exchanging one cryptocurrency for another is simple and quick, moving these assets to fiat and back creates drag and risk in the economy. As a result, Sarkar said that some banks that formerly banked cryptocurrency companies have stopped doing so.  He concluded that in order to stay connected to the traditional economy, cryptocurrency companies have to accept the need to move from bank to bank:  ""What bitcoin exchanges have started doing is playing this game of hot potato.""

42376233,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5UN,1506681026,South Korean Regulator Issues ICO Ban,"South Korea’s financial regulator has prohibited domestic companies and startups from participating in initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Following a meeting to discuss cryptocurrency controls today, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) said it will prohibit all forms of the blockchain funding method ""regardless of technical terminology,"" while margin trading of virtual currencies will also be illegal following the ruling.  Token offerings, a type of fundraising method that has gained popularity in recent months, are overly speculative and constitute a ""violation of the capital market law,"" the FSC states. An ""intensive crackdown"" will ensue, with ""stern penalties"" issued on parties involved in ICO offerings.  Other measures, which are likely to impact cryptocurrency companies more broadly, include on-site inspections from the FSC from the end of September, and the analysis of virtual currency accounts for user data from December.  Further, the regulator will review the operations of cryptocurrency companies with the intent to ""ramend unfair terms and conditions, including arbitrary withdrawal restrictions.""  It is unclear how far the ruling will extend into cryptocurrency exchanges. South Korea has recently seen a surge in cryptocurrency trading. Domestic exchange Bithumb, for example, has a total trading volume of 104,113 BTC, or $427 million, according to CoinMarketCap data at press time.  The FSC statement also cites a wave of recent arrests and closures of companies involved with marketing fake cryptocurrencies, which had apparently acquired 25 billion KRW ($22 million) from a total of around 1,000 investors. Due to such criminal activity, a new ""Virtual Currency Detention Centre"" has been created, the release states.  Neighbouring China also issued an all-out ban on ICOs earlier this month, issuing a regulatory statement that has also led to a number of cryptocurrency exchanges closing their domestic trading operations.

Testing will also include possible applications for mobile phone repair services. A smart contract will be used to determine how much the phone would cost to repair, how much the phone costs on the used market and whether there are any other factors that would be accounted for in the cost.

42400476,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJggA,1506672025,Central Banker's Next Act: Helping Merchants Mint Cryptocurrency,"While the Bank of Russia has long been at the forefront of central bank cryptocurrency exploration, for Vadim Kalukhov, its recently departed director, exploration alone wasn't enough.  Instead, Kalukhov wanted to move faster than central banks typically do, experimenting and in turn, launching a product. So in May, Kalukhov left the central bank to start something of his own. Flash forward to today and Kalukhov is chief information officer at Crassula, a brand-new blockchain startup that's anything but ordinary.  In his first interview revealing the project, Kalukhov, who helped develop the Bank of Russia's masterchain blockchain platform, described how his experience in global finance prepared him to help others do what had previously been the exclusive domain of central banks: mint money.  Kalukhov told CoinDesk:  ""The Crassula open system will allow merchants to build add-ons including their own cryptocurrencies.""  Similar to how ethereum enables users to launch tokens through initial coin offerings (ICOs), Crassula is aiming to help corporations, and eventually governments, issue their own cryptocurrencies. While Kalukhov declined to share details about the platform's construction, he did give insight into a couple key features that stand out.  Unlike ethereum, the platform will be designed as a private blockchain solution with a native wallet for digital fiat and cryptocurrencies. The platform is also expected to run code from the open-source Lightning Network, a scaling proposal originally developed for the bitcoin blockchain.  But technology aside, what is perhaps the project's most interesting trait is the company's evolution out of an existing payments startup in Russia, one with both real clients and profit.  Evolving payments  Indeed, the story isn't as simple as Kalukhov just launching his own endeavor.  Shortly after leaving the Bank of Russia, Kalukhov began discussing ideas with Daria Dubinina, a co-founder of Payment Ninja, a venture-backed startup that bills its service as ""almost free"" payments using the Symfony PHP web application framework.  With Payment Ninja's similar mission, save for its use of technology, Crassula was soon spun-off with the goal of creating an ecosystem where users could spend cryptocurrency on everyday products. It wasn't a huge leap, in that Payment Ninja had already created an ecosystem of merchants and was interested in experimenting with blockchain as a way to make its platform even more useful.  After exchanging a series of ""small white papers,"" Kalukhov was won over by the idea of a collaborative effort with the Payment Ninja team.  In interview with CoinDesk, Dubinina described the network, saying:  ""The final stage of building the Crassula ecosystem would be an open platform on which each company, no matter if it's a small business or a big business, a financial organization or a governmental organization – any company – could issue their own cryptocurrencies and build their own payments systems.""  But whereas ethereum has helped startups use the ICO mechanism to raise capital, Crassula hopes to leverage its existing merchants and new clients to create an ecosystem that powers the exchange of goods.  Planning for growth  And for this, the potential of having existing merchants migrate to the Crassula platform could prove highly important. For one, they mean the newly launched company is not only generating revenue, but profit, according to Dubinina.  As a result of that nascent momentum, earlier this month Crassula hired its eleventh employee and first lead blockchain architect, Anatoly Resin, who was previously a core developer on the Decent blockchain.  Yet, building the blockchain platform won't be cheap, and so to continue growing the team Crassula is planning to launch its own ICO.  Fresh off winning a startup ""battle"" in Kiev, Crassula plans to formally reveal details about its token sale campaign, which will have a soft cap of $7 million and a hard cap of $35 million, this autumn.  But while this all may seem like an unlikely turn for a central banker, Kalukhov argued that utilizing the more experimental capabilities of blockchains is perhaps best viewed as a matter business.  Kalukhov concluded:  ""We are doing this work because we believe in the project, and we invest our time and our money in order to reach the time when our project is live and it will be easy to deliver this widely to the people.""
