42432810,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1hNh,1601590364,BitMEX's Receding Market Share Might Have Spared Bitcoiners Bigger Sell-Off,"Four years ago, when the Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX announced a new product called the “perpetual bitcoin leveraged swap,” few traders in nascent digital-asset markets could have anticipated what a major impact the obscure rollout would have on the industry.      But the instrument, which made it easy for customers to trade the equivalent of $100 of bitcoin for every $1 down, proved hugely popular and successful among risk-hungry traders, vaulting BitMEX into the top ranks of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.      Now, digital-asset analysts and investors are scrambling to assess the market damage after U.S. authorities on Thursday brought a series of regulatory and criminal charges against BitMEX and its CEO, Arthur Hayes.      One change could be less market volatility because BitMEX’s perpetual swaps were infamous for exacerbating price swings: It’s a well-known trope among bitcoin traders that every time the market tilts one way or another, BitMEX customers’ thinly capitalized positions get liquidated in a series of rapid margin calls, exacerbating price swings that reverberated to other exchanges.      “Long term, it’s so much better for the spot market,” said Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager Digital, an online cryptocurrency trading platform.      A nagging question going forward is whether some BitMEX customers in the U.S. – apparently in violation of the country’s laws and regulations – will be forced to close their accounts and possibly sell their bitcoin. That could put downward pressure on prices.      Bitcoin dropped 4% after the charges were unveiled on Thursday, but a few hours later prices had pared some of their losses and were changing hands around $10,580, staying in a range where they’ve traded for several weeks.      BitMEX officials said in a statement they ""strongly disagree"" with the charges and intend to defend against them vigorously. In a Telegram channel, the company said that its trading platform is operating normally and that all funds were safe.    Competitors in the leverage game    Many other cryptocurrency exchanges in recent years had copied BitMEX’s model, rolling out bitcoin trading instruments with leverage of 100 times or greater. And some traders have shifted to those alternate venues, causing BitMEX’s share of the overall bitcoin derivatives market to recede.      That might reduce the market impact from any additional customer defections in the wake of Thursday’s charges, said John Todaro, director of institutional research at cryptcorrency analysis firm TradeBlock.      “Two years ago, this would have been catastrophic, because BitMEX was such a huge percentage of everybody who’s playing leveraged trading,” David Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes Inc., said in a phone interview. “Now, there are quite a few alternatives to BitMEX and several of them have always been more stringent about trading or not allowing U.S. clients to trade on those platforms.”      A snapshot of bitcoin futures trading on Thursday ranked BitMEX fourth among exchanges on 24-hour volumes, behind Binance, Huobi and OKEX, according to the data site Skew. Open interest, or the value of outstanding contracts, stood at $680 million, trailing OKEx.    'Coming for a while now'    Traders were well aware BitMEX was under scrutiny and may have moved to get ahead of any crackdown, according to the digital-asset firm QCP Capital.      “This has been coming for a while now, and while the charges are heavy and coordinated, it remains to see how much bite it actually has,” the firm said on its Telegram channel.      Based on QCP’s tally, BitMEX has about 190,000 bitcoins in its vaults, worth about $2 billion at current prices, with another 36,000 bitcoins in an insurance fund.      It’s possible BitMEX’s example might provide a shot across the bow to overseas cryptocurrency exchanges that might be cutting corners on compliance, while potentially giving regulatory clarity to those exchanges trying to court U.S. customers. Regulated commodities exchanges in the U.S. also typically offer trading leverage, but the most common bitcoin futures contract, from the Chicago-based CME, only allows positions with about three times the initial money down.      ""It clearly sets a tone for other exchanges that compete with Bitmex – and there's more and more of them popping up every day – that you can't do that with U.S. customers,"" Voyager’s Ehrlich said. ""If I was at one of those competing exchanges, I'd be going through my customer records immediately.""      One of the defendants involved in the BitMEX case went as far as to “brag” that “bribing” regulators in a jurisdiction outside the U.S. cost just “a coconut,” according to a statement by FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney Jr. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) bars Americans from bribing overseas officials.      It might have simply been too brazen for regulators to overlook.      “One thing I know with regulators is, if you say things that are antagonistic in discoverable information places, you're much more likely to be punished than people who do something very similar but keep their nose clean and not say anything and act respectfully,” Weisberger said.      – With reporting by Omkar Godbole",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,"Muyao Shen, Bradley Keoun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/01/bitmexs-receding-market-share-might-have-spared-bitcoiners-bigger-sell-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f67c528a8a80e6ad8638a0a4cf06dc0296637792-1446x796.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432806,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1hFh,1601589023,Decentralized Exchange Volume Rose 103% in September to Record $23.6B Even as Growth Consolidated,"September volume on decentralized exchanges recorded its third consecutive month of doubling the trading volume from the previous month after a 160% rise in August, according to Dune Analytics.    Aggregate trading volume on decentralized exchanges reached $23.6 billion in September from $11.6 billion in August, benefiting from continued speculative interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and assets.  Leading decentralized exchange platform Uniswap reported a 128% volume increase in September, reaching $15.3 billion after topping its August record 10 days into the month, as CoinDesk previously reported.  Growth also benefited from new trading platforms like FTX’s Serum launching in September. Less than two weeks after its launch, Serum reported nearly $50 million in volume, according to data aggregator CoinGecko.  Even though aggregate volume set a new record, only a few decentralized exchanges reported individual growth. Trading volume on only three platforms – Curve, Uniswap, and 0x – grew by more than 50% since August.  Successful token distributions by Curve and Uniswap are a main driver of sustained growth, Jack Purdy, decentralized finance analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk.  Their tokens have “undeniably benefitted the protocols” by significantly increasing the Total Value Locked (TVL) on each platform, which “directly correlates to lower slippage and a better trading experience,"" Purdy explained.  In September, previously popular platform Balancer saw its volume drop 2% while the formerly fast-growing Kyber platform grew by less than 0.5 percent.  The uniquely strong incentives of Uniswap and Curve have “cannibalized volume from some of the other decentralized exchanges that don't have the same market-making incentives,” said Purdy.",POSITIVE,없음,BAL | EXCHANGE | TRADING | UNI | ZRX,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/01/decentralized-exchange-volume-rose-103-in-september-to-record-236b-even-as-growth-consolidated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2459a74a759e2098880f60571883f344c971c958-1100x773.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432799,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1h7h,1601588654,DeFi Degens Hit Hard by Eminence Exploit Will Be Partially Compensated,"It all started with a couple of retweets.      On Sept. 28, Andrew Cronje, the head honcho at Yearn Finance, retweeted graphic designs for a new project called Eminence, so described by Cronje as a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol for a “gaming multiverse.” The game is allegedly a spin-off of a 2016 kickstarter trading card game called Eminence: Xander’s Tales and may incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      The retweets included graphic designs of the words “Spartan” and “Marine” (playful nods to the respective monikers given to the Synthetix and Chainlink fanbases) and was an “art teaser” meant to “showcase all the different clans in the game,” according to Cronje.      Cronje hit ""Send"" on the tweet and went to bed. When he woke up, he would find that the tweet was apparently enough of a signal for DeFi users to dump $15 million worth of DAI into the days-old protocol which, while on Ethereum’s mainnet, was still being alpha tested by Cronje and his team. Eminence didn’t even have a website to use as a front-end for trading; the first users instead swapped tokens directly with the Eminence smart contracts.      The same night, one user exploited Eminence’s code and drained the $15 million. Then, the same attacker returned some $8 million in DAI to a Yearn smart contract controlled by Cronje.      Now, not even 72 hours after the exploit, affected users have had a portion of their losses returned.      The debacle and subsequent bailout is not the first of its kind in DeFi. And it begs the question: Does the DeFi community learn from its mistakes?    Eminence 'hack' explained    The exploit itself, which was not even a hack, was simple enough.      The EMN tokens, generated by the Yearn Deploy smart contract, were distributed initially through a bonding curve, a novel token distribution scheme used by a handful of DeFi products. These bonding curves are smart contracts which “trade” tokens with end users, dispensing one in exchange for another.      For Eminence, users would deposit DAI into the smart contract and receive EMN in return. If the EMN is sent to the smart contract, it is burned and the user receives DAI in return.      You could also exchange EMN for five other tokens (eAAVE, eLINK, eYFI, eSNX and eCRV, all Eminence wrapped versions of the popular tokens with the same tickers). Doing so would burn the deposited EMN. Inversely, if you deposit these tokens into their respective bonding curve contracts, it is burned and you receive newly minted EMN.      To exploit these contracts, the attacker took out a flash loan for 15 million DAI from Uniswap and used this to buy EMN. He then traded and burned half this EMN for eAAVE, driving up EMN’s price. From here, he traded the rest of his EMN for DAI, traded his eAAVE to mint more EMN and then finally traded this EMN for DAI.      By the time the attacker was making these moves, someone had already deployed EMN trading pairs on Uniswap.      This process was repeated three times to net the hacker 15,015,533 DAI. A similar attack using a flash loan was executed against the bZx protocol in February.    Yearn Finance’s response and token redistribution    Surprisingly, after all that effort, the attacker had a slight change of heart: They transferred $8 million in DAI to a Yearn Finance contract, which Cronje promptly sent to a Yearn multi-sig.      A handful of developers, one of whom works on Yearn, cooked up a way to distribute the DAI to users affected by EMN’s price crashing through the floor as a result of the exploit. DAI-denominated reparations are now being distributed to users who trade for EMN from the bonding curve contract and Uniswap.      ""Receiving [the DAI tokens] felt like we were gifted a ticking bomb,"" banteg, a Yearn core developer, told CoinDesk. He adding the team worked fast to distribute the funds lest the affected users get restless.      Banteg believes that most of the affected users were ""in the loop"" since half of the restitution was claimed within 19 minutes of the distribution contract being launched. Only $338,000 DAI has yet to be claimed, according to data banteg shared with CoinDesk.      Looking past the attacker’s bad behavior, the fiasco was exacerbated by two driving forces: trust and greed.      In his tweets, Cronje never said the Eminence protocol was ready. He didn’t even mention what the protocol was for. But a single retweet from the guy behind Yearn – that DeFi unicorn which surged in price from $31 to over $43,000 this year – was enough for traders to pile into Eminence’s token.      Yearning for another moonshot, intrepid Eminence users began interacting with the protocol before Cronje gave any signal it was ready for investors. He’s even tweeted caveats before this incident that anyone using his protocols should proceed with caution.      Cronje has since stated his intentions on Twitter to continue his work on Eminence, adding that he has roughly 100 contracts to test. He also cautioned the DeFi faithful to “wait for official announcements” before using them.      Still, some of the affected traders, reeling from their losses, weren’t ready to let Cronje off the hook.      “Why put unfinished code on mainnet to be tested?” one user chimed in. “The contract should have been on testnet.”      Others, like Delphi Digital’s Tom Shaughnessy, defended Cronje, affirming that “it’s not [his] fault that people degen into [his] work before it is finished.”    DeFi lessons hard-learned or hardly learned?    Indeed, so-called DeFi degens have a reputation of “aping” into smart contracts in search of gains before they are thoroughly vetted. Traders deposited several hundred millions worth of tokens into the yield farming protocol Yam Finance back in August, for instance, days before a bug in its unaudited code drove the token’s price into the ground.      More recently, traders deposited so many tokens into the then-unaudited SushiSwap contract that its volume surpassed Uniswap. Days later, SushiSwap’s creator dumped his developer’s share of SUSHI tokens for $13 million in ETH, only to return the sum in ETH to the SushiSwap treasury after a bout of guilt.      With this Eminence exploit and summary restitution now in the books, DeFi traders have another reason to be leery of unvetted protocols. But with the payback soothing their losses somewhat, perhaps this lesson may be forgotten once the next “big new thing” comes around.",NEUTRAL,ETH | YFI | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | YFI | DAI,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/01/defi-degens-hit-hard-by-eminence-exploit-will-be-partially-compensated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/472dec55fbf1124d237d91b0f65a02d68a520e1c-2560x1642.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432800,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1h1h,1601588541,Should DEXs Be Worried After BitMEX? DeFi Founders Weigh In,"The sudden takedown of BitMEX has cast a new light on Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) markets.      On Thursday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) served the Seychelles-based crypto derivatives exchange with a slew of charges, arresting CTO Samuel Reed and seeking out CEO (and admitted DeFi degen) Arthur Hayes for violating the Bank Secrecy Act.      While centralized exchanges (CEXs) reside on central servers in various municipalities around the globe, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap remain uncensorable, existing within smart contracts on top of the Ethereum blockchain. However, they are founded by real, live humans who are subject to the whims of law enforcement agencies. Are they next?      The value proposition of DeFi platforms becomes readily apparent during regulatory crackdowns such as with BitMEX, Robert Leshner, founder of DeFi lending platform Compound, told CoinDesk in an email.      He labeled centralized exchanges (CEX) such as BitMEX as “opaque platforms that can easily facilitate money laundering.”      “By contrast, DeFi done right is a breath of fresh air – complete transparency, accountability, tamper-resistance, and self-custody,” he said, referring to the fact that DeFi transactions exist for all to see on Etherscan. “In the coming months and years, regulators will likely embrace the virtues and benefits of DeFi.”      Leshner’s view was echoed by Michael Egorov, founder of DeFi stablecoin exchange Curve, who told CoinDesk that it was “no surprise” BitMEX was taken down given that “CEXs without {know-your-customer] are natural mixers.” (Coin mixers like Ethereum’s Tornado Cash or Bitcoin’s Wasabi Wallet can be used to launder cryptocurrency, leaving its origins untraceable.)      DEXs, on the other hand, are not mixers given the auditability of blockchain transactions.      “ETH exchanged to USDT on Uniswap keeps USDT as ‘dirty’ and traceable to the source as ETH was (and the same applies to Curve or Balancer or anything similar),” Egorov said. “It could take time for regulators to understand probably, but I think their job would have been much easier if all the exchanges were DEXs.”    Lingering doubts    Regardless of DeFi’s apparent virtues, the $11 billion DeFi market pales in comparison to the larger CEX market. Moreover, DeFi is often left copying the best CEXs have to offer.      Recently, BitMEX’s most popular product found its way into DeFi markets with cryptocurrency derivatives exchange dYdX. The Andreessen Horowitz-backed firm launched its Bitcoin Perpetual Contract in May, followed by a perpetual contract denominated in ether in August.      Read more: CipherTrace Outlines Regulatory Gray Zones Plaguing Booming DeFi Sector      Like BitMEX, dYdX blocks users from multiple jurisdictions including the United States. “We believe we are in compliance with all applicable regulations in the markets we serve,” dYdX founder Antonio Juliano told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.      BitMEX’s products themselves were not the cause for the CFTC and DOJ clampdown, however. Regulators specifically cited lack of formal know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.      According to the DOJ complaint:    “For example, in or about May 2018, Arthur Hayes, the defendant, was notified of claims that BitMEX was being used to launder the proceeds of a cryptocurrency hack. BitMEX did not implement a formal AML policy in response to this notification.”    Many DEXs fall under the same guise, including Uniswap, especially given recent events with funds from the hacked KuCoin exchange.    Uniswap's rise    Uniswap rose to prominence over the course of 2020 after releasing the second version of its platform with a novel take on increasing market liquidity through token pools.      Yet, Uniswap does not have KYC or AML procedures. All a user needs is an Ethereum wallet – easily downloadable in minutes – and some tokens. (However, it remains fairly difficult to purchase ETH without going through a KYC check at some point.) Traders that used the platform before September were even rewarded with a lucrative airdrop of Uniswap’s new UNI governance token.      Uniswap founder Hayden Adams declined to comment for this story.      Stani Kulechov, co-founder of the Aave DeFi money market, told CoinDesk that builders shouldn’t be daunted by Arthur Hayes’ current predicament. Instead, he said, take note of the crypto industry’s two largest success stories: Bitcoin and Ethereum.      Wrote Kulechov:    “For DeFi builders it might be relevant to have from the start a clear path towards decentralized governance similarly what Ethereum and Bitcoin is today, where there is no centrally controlled entity governing these protocols by design. In the end also remember who you are building for and make safe products for all stakeholders.”    Whether that will stand the test of U.S. financial regulators remains to be seen.

The drop coincided with the announcement crypto derivatives venue BitMEX was formally being charged by U.S. regulators for unregistered trading, among other transgressions.      “The news of BitMEX being served with a lawsuit by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] was met with broad-based selling pressure,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for crypto brokerage Bequant.      Read More: BitMEX ‘Attempted to Evade’ US Regulations, CFTC, DOJ Charge      “This is big,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, on the CFTC’s announcement. However, Shah noted the declining influence of BitMEX on the market since March, when over $700 million in liquidations helped cause the price of bitcoin to dump as low as $3,854 on spot exchanges.      “BitMEX has slowly and consistently bled open interest since March,” Shah said. “This news may accelerate that narrative, but I do not see it being a systemic risk at this point if there is an orderly resolution.”      A number of new derivatives venues, most of which do not provide access to anyone in the United States, is one of the reasons for BitMEX’s decline in the market, said Bequant’s Vinokourov. “BitMEX’s overall importance to the broader ecosystem is not as critical as was the case a few years ago,” Vinokourov added. “Not only have many other exchanges been catching up with BitMEX liquidity and order book depth, but also a widely publicized tech issue earlier this year put a big dent into venue's reputation amongst the larger crypto trading desks.”      Nonetheless, liquidations on BitMEX helped push bitcoin's price down Thursday, as $15 million in sell liquidations in the past 24 hours wiped out long-oriented traders on the derivatives platform, similar to a margin call in traditional markets.      Outside of BitMEX, macro economic events could lead to selling pressure as October opens, according to Andrew Tu, an executive at crypto quant trading firm Efficient Frontier.      “Bitcoin has been stuck in the $10,000-$11,000 range since the drop in the beginning of September,” noted Tu. “The elephant in the room at this point is pretty much the macro climate, with [U.S.] elections coming up and the inability to compromise on a fiscal stimulus between the House [of Representatives] and Senate,” he added.    Ethereum miners reap record revenue from fees    Bequant’s Vinokourov was more bullish on the crypto market’s future, particularly with progress in Ethereum’s long and winding upgrade. “The underlying fundamentals are positive, especially for ETH given the very recent launch of ‘Spadina’ – the final testnet ahead of the Ethereum blockchain's upgraded mainnet release,” added Vinokourov.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Thursday trading around $353 and slipping 0.83% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Miner revenue from fees charged to use Ethereum averaged 38% in August, which was then a record high. It was surpassed in September, when miner revenue from fees hit another record, at 48.5%.      Tellurian Capital’s Jean-Marc Bonnefous, who has been investing in the crypto ecosystem since 2014, said some of the outrageous returns within DeFi are enticing users despite high transactional fees the miners are pocketing.      “Even with high gas costs on Ethereum, some of the net returns available on DeFi are still quite attractive compared to alternatives,” said Bonnefous. ”The basic problem, though, is that these returns are not sustainable in the long run, whatever the Ethereum costs and issues are.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed on Thursday, mostly in the red.

42432805,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1hDh,1601582141,"Bitcoin Starts Shrugging Off BitMEX Bombshell, Recoups Nearly Half of 4% Price Dip","Bitcoin traders have begun recovering from Thursday's bombshell indictments from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Department of Justice against BitMEX and the exchange's co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, and Business Development Lead Greg Dwyer.    Bitcoin (BTC) initially dropped 4% from roughly $10,800 on BitMEX futures on the news, a relatively modest move for typically volatile cryptocurrency markets. Early last month, for example, BTC made three consecutive 7%-8% dips Sept. 2-3 after trading above $11,000 for the first time this year.  “There was some expected negative price action following the dissipation of the BitMEX lawsuit, but the market has seemingly settled a few percent down from where it was beforehand,” said Sam Trabucco, quantitative trader at Alameda Research.  Alternate cryptocurrencies (altcoins) followed BTC’s lead Thursday afternoon with the decentralized finance sector of altcoins dropping less than 3% over the past 24 hours, according to Messari.  Thursday is historically the most volatile day of the week, according to cryptocurrency research firm Markets Science. But “it’s not yet clear whether the market as a whole decides the impact we’ve already seen is sufficient,” said Trabucco.  At last check, BTC has retraced almost half of the intraday dip as buyers pushed the price from $10,450 to $10,580 on BitMEX.  The market’s immediate reaction Thursday may only be the precursor to more volatility, however, Trabucco told CoinDesk. “We’ll see how the markets that are currently mostly asleep react. I’d expect increased potential for volatility as more people are able to react.”  If Thursday’s minor dip cascades into a larger sell-off, “It’s going to be a buying opportunity,” said Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager Digital, a publicly listed cryptocurrency exchange. “Whatever gets liquidated, will get liquidated, and the markets will reposition and start growing again.”  As traders react to the news, BitMEX assured its customers that ""the BitMEX platform is operating entirely as normal and all funds are safe,"" according to a message published to its announcements channel on Telegram.

42432788,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1bzh,1601578754,DeFi Has a Front-Running Problem. Sparkpool's Potential Fix Is Launching This Month,"Ethereum mining pool Sparkpool will launch its new mining network, Taichi Network, complete with a “private transaction” feature in October, CoinDesk confirmed with Sparkpool co-founder Xin Xu.      The network “will gradually go online” this month in what could be one solution to decentralized finance’s (DeFi) long-standing problem with front running, the practice of trading based on information about future trades contained in a blockchain’s transaction queue in cryptocurrency markets.      Taichi’s features are “not designed for selfish usage” but instead for the “public good” of the Ethereum ecosystem, Xu told CoinDesk in an email.      “We will offer Taichi Network’s features as infrastructure to the Ethereum [ecosystem], and we will see how the reaction works out then,” he said. Think of it as a privacy shield meant to level the playing field for all traders.      Sparkpool currently makes up 23% of Ethereum hashing power, according to Etherscan.    Ethereum’s dark forest    Ethereum’s transaction queue – called a mempool – is often alluded to as a “dark forest” due to the predatory nature of arbitrage bots spying on transactions.      First coined by venture capital firm Paradigm’s Dan Robinson, the “dark forest” metaphor describes bots lurking in a blockchain’s mempool to copy and execute profitable trades before the original executes.      Bot arbitrage has long troubled Ethereum, most notably described in a 2019 Cornell University paper entitled “Flash Boys 2.0.”      Profits earned by arbitrage bots skyrocketed over the summer months with an average of 50-100 ether (ETH) earned per day in May, according to estimates shared with CoinDesk by one arbitrage trading firm that requested anonymity. These profits climbed as high as 2,000-3,000 ETH per day at the height of the DeFi mania in early September.      Read more: DeFi Traders Are Gaming Ethereum for Higher Profits, Researchers Say      Private transaction networks like Taichi can cut a path through the trees, however. The mining party, in this case Sparkpool, opts out of broadcasting the chosen transaction destined for its block to the rest of the network. By not communicating to other mempool lurkers, the miner’s transaction gains a higher degree of safety from hungry bots.      For example, Sparkpool’s latest innovation enabled white-hat hacker Samczun to recently save 25,000 ether worth $9.6 million from broken decentralized finance (DeFi) project Lien Finance, according to a self-published account.      On the other hand, you are entrusting your transaction entirely to Sparkpool, meaning the mining giant could front run you itself more easily.      Xu said disrupting the current front-running issues plaguing DeFi transactions “is definitely a direction worth exploring” with Taichi.    Taichi’s early days    Certain aspects of Taichi Network are public, including a general domain registered in July 2020, according to WHOIS. The website remains under construction, but describes Taichi as a “viable Proof-of-Stake (mPoS) Ethereum sidechain” complete with relayers and smart contract capabilities.      Relayers broadcast transactions faster than regular settlements on blockchains by constructing pathways between major nodes. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own relayer networks, such as FIBRE and BloXroute.      Read more: Marlin Releases Open-Source ‘Layer 0’ Transaction Relayer for Ethereum      Sparkpool data website GasNow also includes information on Taichi, describing the network as “greatly improving the efficiency of transactions broadcast” by “directly pushing received transactions into a mempool of mining pools.”      CoinDesk’s invest: ethereum economy is a fully virtual event Oct. 14 exploring the ramifications for investors of the sweeping changes underway within the Ethereum ecosystem.

FinCEN’s advisory notes that governmental entities, and financial, educational and health care institutions have been particularly targeted by these attacks.   The financial watchdog’s advisory notes the “severity and sophistication” of such attacks has continued to rise. It adds that this also represents a major concern for financial intermediaries, like banks or exchanges, because quite often they’re the ones processing ransom payments for such attacks.   The advisory said these attacks have increasingly targeted larger enterprises for bigger payouts, attackers tend to share resources to increase effectiveness of their attacks, and usually require payments be made using cryptocurrencies, most commonly bitcoin (BTC).

With the news, announced Thursday, the Ethereum-as-a-service platform said it now has over $78 million in total value locked (TVL).  These staked millions come from more than 4,000 users and entities from 90 countries helping to secure some 130 network nodes across 46 validators, SKALE said in an announcement.

The modular cloud-based network claims to offer developers of Ethereum-based dapps (decentralized apps) the ability scale to thousands of transactions per second at low cost, while reaching large numbers of Ethereum users.  With Ethereum’s gas fees having skyrocketed in recent months due to a surge in demand for DeFi products, stablecoins and more, SKALE says it can help reduce that burden with its ""elastic"" and configurable chains.

Top shelf    Australia modernizes Australia will commit A$800 million (US$575 million) to invest in digital technologies as part of its coronavirus recovery plan, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Tuesday. The federal plan will see US$256.6 million for a digital identity solution, $419.9 million to fully implement the Modernising Business Registers (MBR) program, $22.2 million for small businesses training to utilize digital technologies and two blockchain pilot programs totalling $6.9 million. “The Plan supports Australia’s economic recovery by removing out-dated regulatory barriers, boosting the capability of small businesses and backs the uptake of technology across the economy,” Morrison said in the announcement.      Nasdaq launch Blockchain services firm Diginex has become the first crypto exchange operator to list on Nasdaq. The stock went live Thursday morning under the EQOS ticker symbol, a nod to the firm’s EQUOS.io trading platform. CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reports Diginex’s back-door listing came through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Diginex CEO Richard Byworth said he expects a mix of global retail and institutional investors to buy shares. Over time, he expects the majority of Diginex shareholders to be U.S. investors because of the Nasdaq listing.      Dorsey responds Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted his disapproval of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s mission statement to keep his company free and clear of politics. Dorsey argued that by the very act of being a crypto exchange, Coinbase was always already engaged in politics. ""Bitcoin (aka 'crypto') is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system which negatively affects so much of our society. Important to at least acknowledge and connect the related societal issues your customers face daily. This leaves people behind,"" Dorsey tweeted. Armstrong made waves this week – in and out of crypto – when saying Coinbase, and its employees, should keep work and activism separate.      Election predictions Putting stake to their claims, many crypto-political gamblers have cast their vote predicting who might win the contentious U.S. presidential election. CoinDesk markets editor Lawrence Lewitinn looked at the data following this week's first presidential debate and found many are betting incumbent President Donald Trump will lose in November. While bettors on decentralized betting platforms like Augur and futures markets on FTX aren’t as bullish on the challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, he does have the odds. “Thus what’s true at the time of publication can change on a dime. It is now fewer than five weeks until Election Day. Buckle up!” Lewitinn warns.      Mining profits HIVE Blockchain has reported its best-ever quarter, as the mining firm raked in record fees from the frenzied activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) over the summer. The Toronto-listed mining company released its unaudited results Thursday, saying it mined a total of 32,000 ether (ETH) and 121,000 ethereum classic (ETC) in the second fiscal quarter ending Sept. 30. Per CoinDesk's price data, that comes to nearly $11.8 million for mining ether, and a further $664,000 for ethereum classic – approximately $12.4 million at time of writing. The figures represent a near 30% increase from the 25,000 ETH that HIVE mined in the first quarter and a 50% increase in the same quarter in 2019.      Stealth launch In the latest effort to smooth a path for buttoned-up investors, Talos, an institutional-grade conduit to the crypto ecosystem, is emerging from stealth mode to serve brokers, custodians, exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks. The platform started out in 2018 and is backed by an impressive list of investors including Autonomous Partners, Castle Island Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and Initialized Capital. Over the past year or so, Talos has been quietly onboarding a core group of capital market participants, so that the platform can make its debut in a revenue-generating state.

Though Kik will have an opportunity to appeal.      Responding to the SEC’s motion to summary judgment – where the regulator can ask to conclude a trial based on “undisputed material facts,” rather than engaging in a trial – U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein found Kik’s “token distribution event” (TDE) satisfied the three prongs of the Howey Test.      CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De reports that initial coin offerings (ICOs) and token sales have been treated as unregistered securities sales for the most part by the SEC.      Kik became a champion for crypto freedoms when challenging the SEC’s claims that its kin ICO – which the company pursued in lieu of VC backing – was an unregistered securities offering. The firm’s CEO Ted Livingston took a gamble, selling off his messaging business in 2019 and going all in on kin.      ""We are getting sued by the SEC. We are going to go to court to fight them. We believe they are wrong,"" Livingston told CoinDesk in 2019. Several times, and in different ways, he asserted: ""It's not that we did something wrong. It's that we did it first.""      In a statement, Livingston said he was “disappointed in this ruling,” and that the company is considering its options, including a potential appeal.      Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist and Anderson Kill lawyer, tweeted: “Tl;dr the court shredded Kik. Don’t f*** around with tokens in America.”      Notably, in a separate action, the SEC has ordered Salt Lending to offer investors refunds for its 2017 ICO. Salt has agreed to settle the action and will pay a $250,000 civil penalty to the Commission in the next 10 days.    Market intel    Crash for cash Bitcoin faced selling pressure in September as the U.S. dollar rose against major currencies for the first time in six months. The cryptocurrency fell by over 7% over the period – the biggest monthly percentage decline since March, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, when prices fell by nearly 25% as the coronavirus-induced crash in the global equity markets triggered a global dash for cash, sending the dollar higher. Bitcoin's latest monthly decline is again accompanied by an uptick in the greenback.      Eth revenues Ethereum miners earned over six times more in fees compared to those working on Bitcoin in September. Glassnode data shows Ethereum's total transaction fees stood at an all-time high of $166 million for the month – far more than the $26 million taken in Bitcoin fees. Fee revenue on Ethereum first outpaced Bitcoin's in June, the same month decentralized lender Compound released its governance token and kick-started the DeFi mania, CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports.    Op-ed    Common cause Matt Luongo, founder of Thesis, writes that Bitcoiners who stack sats and people who use decentralized finance share common cause. “Bitcoiners who stack sats should take a hard look at the decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms seeing explosive growth on Ethereum. While the optics may call to mind the wild speculation of 2017, the truth is that much of the growth in DeFi is driven by the same sound money principles as stacking,” he writes.    Internet 2030    Amy Webb, a quantitative futurist and founder of the strategic foresight firm Future Today Institute, thinks the world can, indeed, get worse. In an interview with CoinDesk, as part of the Internet 2030 series, she lays out her vision for the world where big tech only gets bigger. The conversation has been excerpted below.      Do you see a genuine way out through distributed technologies that may give people control over their own data?      I worry about people who never update their passwords – should we entrust them to manage sensitive data? There are complex questions about data hygiene, data governance, compliance, risk. Distributed tech solutions solve some of our problems, but not all.      Few people have an understanding of how data are collected, by whom, for what purpose. There are lots of organizations proposing some kind of “ownership” model, where we individually would “own” our data. What does that mean?      I want consumers to be much better aware of what data they are generating – that includes the digital emissions they’re releasing without realizing it. Think of all the metadata being generated by our connected devices, the ambient sounds in our homes and offices, our movements and gestures. All of those digital emissions, plus the PIIs collected now by contract tracing apps and biometric scanning systems – I mean, we’re swimming in data.      What might the cultural or political effects be of an ever-greater consolidated and extractive web?      We talk about privacy a lot, and journalists certainly write a lot of stories about data sharing, privacy and consolidation within the tech sector. But when it comes to everyday consumers and business leaders, it just doesn’t seem like these are priority issues. We’ll feel the effects when there is litigation, new policy or sweeping policy enacted.      Have an idea for what the future of the internet will look like, reach out to daniel@coindesk.com.

42432782,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1bph,1601568099,Startup Backed by Uber Co-Founder Poaches CoinList President Andy Bromberg,"CoinList co-founder Andy Bromberg is leaving the token offering platform to helm Eco, a cryptocurrency built to marry savings and spending.      ""I feel like the past eight years I have been searching nonstop for the thing that's going to onboard the world to crypto,"" Bromberg told CoinDesk in a phone call.      CoinList has been the premier site to launch a token while also providing the back-end that helped with compliant sales, going all the way back to 2017's initial coin offering (ICO) boom, when it was formed out of a partnership between AngelList and Protocol Labs.      Eco is a project that has been stealthy for some time. Originally launched as Beam (not the MimbleWimble privacy coin), it has rebranded to Eco thanks to involvement by founding advisor, Garrett Camp, who held the Eco brand. Camp is an Uber co-founder who backed the project through his venture fund, Expa.      Right now Eco is in beta with a limited set of users, trying it out with USDC. Later, the ECO token will launch as an ERC-20. Bromberg is excited about the game plan because, he argues, what the industry is missing is a way to bring people in.      ""You need a migration path. It's kind of what we're seeing with DeFi [decentralized finance] with liquidity migration,"" Bromberg said, referring to how SushiSwap enticed users to move their liquidity deposits from UniSwap to an upstart market maker.    Eco adoption    Eco will get money into user accounts much the same as banks do: by giving people a good reason to deposit their paychecks straight into the Eco app.      They will do it, Bromberg argues, because it will allow them to drop some portion into crypto, like a savings account, where it will earn a far better return than a bank savings account ever could (enhanced returns come courtesy of the premium on stablecoins, thanks to DeFi).      Bromberg said between 2.5% and 5% interest, far far better than the under 0.05% interest most banks give savers these days.      But, also like a bank, it will make transacting easy and perhaps better. Eco will give rebates in its token on payments to major merchants, such as Amazon. With better saving and better spending, Bromberg believes people will want to use the app (which also happens to mean that they will be using crypto).      Read more: Crypto Lender Dharma Pivots to Stablecoin Savings Accounts      The idea is not unprecedented. This is basically the strategy that Alipay used to create the largest money market in the world.      Eco has raised $8.5 million, with Pantera Capital and Camp's Expa leading the round, along with many angels, according to Bromberg.    CoinList departure    Bromberg noted that he's leaving CoinList despite how well it's doing. As a co-owner, he will continue as a special advisor to the firm, which will continue to be led by the remaining co-founder and CEO, Graham Jenkin.      During Bromberg's tenure, CoinList pioneered key products for the space, such as airdrops and online crypto hackathons. It earned gold-standard status as the place to offer new tokens and backing from Square co-founder Jack Dorsey.      In his new role, which he begins Monday, Bromberg looks forward to bringing Eco's token to life.      ""The ECO currency will launch in six months or so and that currency, which is a low-volatility currency, is built from the ground up for payments,"" Bromberg said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/01/startup-backed-by-uber-co-founder-poaches-coinlist-president-andy-bromberg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ef19545787ad0ea8c83b219d5fc4023278f782e-1691x1018.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1bhh,1601568023,Braintrust Raises $18M to Bring DeFi-Thinking to the Gig Economy,"The next generation of the gig economy could look more like decentralized finance (DeFi) than Uber.      Announced Thursday, Braintrust, a tech talent marketplace that will essentially be owned by the IT freelancers and companies using it, has raised an $18 million strategic growth round, bringing its total funding to date to $24 million.      Employing a system of blockchain-based tokens to align the incentives of users and keep fees low, Braintrust boasts a nice mix of seasoned Silicon Valley VCs and crypto heavyweights like Pantera, Multicoin and Galaxy Digital. Notable joiners on today’s round are Omidyar Technology Ventures, the original online marketplace builders.      San Francisco-based Braintrust is another example of how the core tenets of DeFi’s multi-billion dollar science experiment can be applied to real-world use cases. Unlike the often vague “utility” of ICO tokens that were sold in the billions back in 2017, Braintrust is focused on solving the liquidity problem encountered when establishing two-sided marketplaces.      Braintrust’s solution reflects the pooled flexibility and decentralized governance of protocols like Compound Finance, on which some of its software is based.      Read more: This Startup Is Forking Compound to Make Hiring More Efficient      Stepping back, Braintrust CEO Adam Jackson is a veteran at building two-sided marketplaces, including an e-commerce platform acquired by Intuit, an automotive marketplace acquired by Advanced Autoparts and another called Doctor on Demand. The common denominator is how expensive it can be to build liquidity into these networks in order to make them fly, and the effect this can have further down the line.      “The typical playbook from eBay all the way up to the gig economy players we see now, is you raise hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars, and use that money to subsidize one or both sides of the marketplace,” said Jackson. “You’re essentially paying people to show up.”      And the way this typically plays out is the investors, who are the owners of the marketplace, sooner or later start taxing the network, turning up the fees. This then starts to erode the network effects of the business, said Jackson, creating divergent incentives between the operators of the service and the people who make a living there.      The depressing nadir of this is encapsulated in the iniquities of Uber; the sort of stuff that has effectively lowered the minimum wage in the U.S., said Jackson.      “While five guys in San Francisco became deca-billionaires, a third of all Uber drivers live below the poverty line, some of them even live in the cars they drive,” he said. “So I wanted to figure out how we could create a marketplace that is owned and controlled by its users, instead of investors who just want to tax it.”    Non-profit protocol    Jackson describes Braintrust as a “labor protocol” in the same way that Ethereum is a smart -contract protocol. As such, it’s more like a non-profit, a kind of public good, he said, upon which other businesses and use cases will flourish, rather like the composability, or the Lego-like functionality of building with DeFi.      “Our business model with Braintrust involves lowering the fees to almost zero. We charge talent zero; we charge clients 10%, that’s just meant to kind of pay our bills and sustain us,” Jackson said. “By lowering fees to zero, you enable a whole new class of big transactions that could never touch a place like Upwork, because the fees are too high.”      Likewise, the project’s tokenomics are confined to governance and voting decisions (there will be a free issuance of tokens to Braintrust users in the middle of next year). The tokens are simply a way to get millions of users across the world on the same page because you can’t have someone in Ukraine or in India custody a share of a Delaware C-corp, said Jackson.      “A blockchain-secure token is a perfect value-capture incentive and governance instrument to replace a share of stock,” Jackson said. “And when I say replace, I don’t mean a financial token, there’s no dividend.”      Once the Braintrust community of freelancers is up and running, they will be able to use their tokens to vote on proposals such as fee levels, categories of work to be added, standards for allowing workers to join and so on.      Braintrust’s token voting system is a fork of the governance framework created by DeFi money market Compound Finance, actually using some of the same code. (Compound CEO Robert Leshner is a close ally and advisor to the project.)      Jackson pointed out that he started Braintrust well before DeFi was a thing, but said the comparison is apt.      “What DeFi figured out was how to use a token as an incentive mechanism to bootstrap liquidity in a two-sided marketplace – DeFi’s lend and borrow,” he said. “We’re doing the same thing, using a token to bootstrap liquidity in a two-sided marketplace. Ours is labor and clients.”    An ill wind    Following a two-year incubation and armed with a $6 million seed round, Braintrust’s private beta was just getting off the ground when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.      “We thought we were toast,” said Jackson.      But after “a terrible few months,” clients started calling back, with more and more large firms accepting that working remotely was becoming the norm. “So that has become a big tailwind,” Jackson said. “Our Q3 was two times our pre-COVID financial plan for marketplace transactions and that has brought us to this fundraising round we are announcing.”      In terms of numbers, Jackson said Braintrust currently has several thousand testnet token holders and a waitlist of 40,000 for when the service goes public next year. There’s also an impressive roster of 50 or so Fortune 100 clients.      “We just won a job at NASA, where we have a group of engineers building software that will track packages to and from the International Space Station,” said Jackson. “We’re building car software for Porsche, insurance shopping software for Blue Cross Blue Shield. So these are big jobs. It’s not like a logo on a website.”      The thing that’s attracting big enterprise players like Porsche and Nestle are the low fees, Jackson reiterated, and not some kind of tech wizardry.      “It’s not because we are building on a blockchain,” he said. “These guys don’t give a shit about that.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/01/braintrust-raises-18m-to-bring-defi-thinking-to-the-gig-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9702e265eb4638747b2b73996225a6175318e80e-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a public statement Thursday, the RBA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) told the Australian Stock Exchange it should replace its aged Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) in a safe but timely manner.  This comes days after ASX told shareholders it was yet again delaying the launch of its blockchain-based trading system.  Having confirmed it was replacing CHESS in December 2017, ASX originally planned to launch the new system in Q1 2020.  This was pushed back to August 2021 and delayed again this year until 2022, with the exchange citing disruption from the pandemic.  Both the RBA and ASIC told ASX getting the new system up and running was imperative for improving the overall performance of Australia's financial system as well as bolstering investor's confidence.  In a public reply, ASX said further delays were justified to ensure the DLT-based system was able to meet peak capacity.  ASX had seen an ""extraordinary increase in activity levels"" during the initial sell-off in mid-March and said it wanted to ensure its new system was able to handle this sort of capacity from the day of launch.

The CFTC announced Thursday that BitMEX, CEO Arthur Hayes, company owners Ben Delo and Samuel Reed, and corporate entities HDR Global Trading Limited, 100x Holding Limited, ABS Global Trading Limited, Shine Effort Inc Limited and HDR Global Services (Bermuda) Limited allegedly offered U.S. customers illicit crypto derivative trading services.      Similarly, Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced that Hayes, Delo, Reed and Gregory Dwyer (BitMEX's first employee) were being charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and conspiracy to violate the act. Reed has already been arrested; the others remain at large, an SDNY press release said.      ""One defendant went as far as to brag the company incorporated in a jurisdiction outside the U.S. because bribing regulators in that jurisdiction cost just 'a coconut,'"" said Assistant FBI Director William Sweeney Jr. in a statement. ""Thanks to the diligent work of our agents, analysts, and partners with the CFTC, they will soon learn the price of their alleged crimes will not be paid with tropical fruit, but rather could result in fines, restitution, and federal prison time.""      In a statement sent to CoinDesk after the publication of this article, attorneys for Dwyer said they would contest the charges, adding that their client had complied with the CFTC investigation ""and was never so much as invited to speak with prosecutors in the United States Attorney's Office in Manhattan.""      Dwyer ""always worked in good faith to comply with all applicable regulations and requirements,"" the statement said.      In a press release, the CFTC alleged that BitMEX received some $11 billion in bitcoin deposits and made more than $1 billion in fees, ""while conducting significant aspects of its business from the U.S. and accepting orders and funds from U.S. customers.""    US Markets    The CFTC charged BitMEX with executing futures transactions on an unregistered board, offering illegal options, failing to register as a futures commission merchant, failing to register as a designated contract market, failing to implement proper know-your-customer rules and other counts, according to an attached legal filing.      BitMEX, which has reportedly been under investigation by the CFTC since at least July 2019, implemented mandatory KYC in April of this year.      ""BitMEX touts itself as the world’s largest cryptocurrency derivatives platform in the world with billions of dollars’ worth of trading each day. Much of this trading volume and its profitability derives from its extensive access to United States markets and customers,"" the filing said. ""Nevertheless, BitMEX has never been registered with the CFTC in any capacity and has not complied with the laws and regulations that are essential to the integrity and vitality of the U.S. markets.""      The CFTC is looking for a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from entering into any transactions ""involving 'commodity interests,'"" soliciting funds for purchasing or selling commodity interests and applying for registration with the CFTC.      In addition, the agency wants the defendants to disgorge profits; provide full restitution to its customers; pay civil penalties; and rescind “all contracts and agreements” with any customers if those agreements violate the law.      ""As a derivatives market regulator that supports innovation and ingenuity, it is imperative that we actively police trading platform activity and remove the bad apples so that legitimate, law-abiding marketplaces can flourish,"" said CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz in a statement. ""We will not stand for any participant brazenly flouting our rules. I look forward to the successful resolution of this matter and the beneficial impact it will have in this market by holding those who deliberately ignore the law accountable.""    'Strongly disagree'    In a statement shared after this article was published, an external HDR Global spokesperson pushed back against the charges.      ""We strongly disagree with the U.S. government’s heavy-handed decision to bring these charges, and intend to defend the allegations vigorously,"" the statement said. ""From our early days as a start-up, we have always sought to comply with applicable U.S. laws, as those laws were understood at the time and based on available guidance.""      BitMEX's official Telegram group later expanded on this, adding the platform was operating normally and recommending users reach out to its support page if they have further questions.      ""In the meantime, the BitMEX platform is operating entirely as normal and all funds are safe. To allay any potential customer concerns, pending withdrawal requests were processed at 17:45 UTC, in line with our standard procedures.

42432791,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1c7h,1601566051,The Hard Forks That Didn't Dilute Bitcoin,"Some time ago, one of the more thoughtful critiques of Bitcoin went a little like this:      “Sure, bitcoin is scarce in its supply, but since it’s effectively costless to clone the software and fork it, it’s not scarce overall. Forks constitute effective dilution and render the Bitcoin system’s commitment to a hard cap irrelevant.”      This wasn’t altogether a terrible point. For a moment in 2017, it seemed like Bitcoin was being forked on a weekly basis. I’ll confess to feeling a twinge of concern when bitcoin cash (BCH) launched on Coinbase at $4,000 and it seemed like a genuine possibility that it might surpass bitcoin. One of Bitcoin’s peculiarities is the fact that anyone can costlessly replicate its UTXO set and claim affiliation to the original chain. Some particularly confident promoters have even gone as far as to claim their forks actually constitute the original Bitcoin, with the legacy chain being the imposter.      If any of these forks had meaningfully gained ground relative to Bitcoin, the critics would have had a point. What’s the point of a monetary network which is undergoing a constant state of fragmentation?    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.    I was reminded of this concern by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor in his recent appearance on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast. Saylor, the first public company CEO to allocate a meaningful portion of his company’s balance sheet to Bitcoin, had this to say:      The hard forks I think are a big advantage. The fact that Bitcoin went through it and we saw what happened and we saw that the community would defend Bitcoin, that’s what gives a person like me confidence to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into bitcoin. I don’t want to hear that you have got a new idea and you are upset over transaction fees and you would like to implement smart contracts and change everything. […] I want to hear that you are going to defend the network to the death against someone that is going to break it or compromise it in any way shape or form.      With the benefit of hindsight, it’s now clear the challenger forks have been completely rejected. This wasn’t something that was evident in 2017, and it’s indicative of bitcoin’s continued maturation as a monetary asset of consequence.      There are many ways to measure the salience of forks, but the simplest is their aggregate economic significance. When you adjust for free float (as in, taking into account only units which are actually circulating), BCH amounts to a meager 1.7% of bitcoin’s market capitalization, an all-time low since inception. Bitcoin sv (BSV) accounts for a measly 1%.      Transaction fees, used to guarantee the sustainability of miner revenue and hence network security in the long term, are robust in bitcoin (>$700k daily) and practically nonexistent in BCH and BSV ($137/day and $73/day over the last week, respectively). If they can’t muster demand for their blockspace – and I don’t see any catalysts to reverse this trend – they will be forced to reintroduce inflation, centralize block signing, or devise some new consensus mechanism.      And if you eliminate non-monetary OP_RETURN transactions (used to insert arbitrary data into blockchain), Bitcoin Cash settles about 12,000 transactions a day, compared to Bitcoin’s ~350,000.      For a network whose foundational value proposition involved vastly increasing the supply of blockspace to pursue the low-fee, peer-to-peer petty cash vision of Bitcoin, this is a considerable letdown. Three years on, the core hypothesis of Bitcoin Cash – that cheaper blockspace would be more amenable to vibrant on-chain commerce – looks more remote than ever. How long must enthusiasts defer their dream before they admit that a minority, largely undifferentiated clone of Bitcoin isn’t a particularly compelling proposition?      Today, BCH is facing an insurrection and yet another hard fork due to an inability to finance its core developers. Unlike Bitcoin, it never developed a meaningful patronage system. So now certain BCH developers are holding the chain hostage and demanding that miners be expropriated to subsidize their work. The looming hard fork is a consequence of founding the chain on a secessionist impulse. If your reaction to disputes is to fork the chain rather than resolve them, you are likely condemning yourself to a litany of future forks.    By refusing to compromise on its key features, Bitcoin has retained its luster while avoiding capture.    All of this bodes poorly for future minority forks. Investors tend to fight the last war. As BCH, BSV and other more marginal forks fade into irrelevance, they will be very wary of any newer protest forks.      Back in 2017, it was popular to proclaim that Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, were governed by the possibility of exit. If users and investors disagreed with the direction of the project, they could simply fork it and build something more to their liking, or so the saying went. This always rankled me because the natural end state of this paradigm – if taken to its logical conclusion – would be a hopeless fragmentation of Bitcoin’s user base into dozens of marginally different tribes.      This seems unacceptable. Bitcoin is designed such that users agree over a very narrow set of principles, in order to obtain global convergence on a UTXO set. The smaller the argument space, the less likely the project is riven by irreconcilable differences between users. By refusing to compromise on its key features, Bitcoin has retained its luster while avoiding capture.      See also: Nic Carter - The Biggest Story in Crypto: The Stablecoin Surge and Power Politics (podcast)      Interestingly, it’s this inflexibility that permits it to appeal to a heterogeneous user base. Bitcoin users do not need to believe in anything other than the merit of a sound, finite supply, fast-settling digital money system. As Saylor notes, far from being a drawback, Bitcoin’s rigidity is a source of strength and credibility. We’re talking about monetary goods here: something you’d feel confident allocating your savings to for decades. Bitcoin’s stewards don’t take this task lightly, and it shows.      It’s clear now that Bitcoin’s network-driven advantages are insurmountable. If Bitcoin were to be supplanted as a digitally native sound money, its challenger would have to be radically different, with dramatic 10x improvements in multiple key domains. Bitcoin is by no means guaranteed to win as the internet’s sole sound money. But at the very least, we can put one old critique to bed.

The second testnet, named Zinken, will launch Oct. 12 at 12:00 UTC.  Ryan said he is “primarily looking for a clean client release process and minimal headaches for users” with Zinken.  The dress rehearsal testnets were created to give Ethereum stakers another practice run at moving ether (ETH) into the Eth 2.0 deposit contract, a necessary step before the new blockchain can start working.  Spadina hit a snag due to “configuration parameters” with Prysmatic Labs’ Prysm client, the team said in a post-mortem.  “We lagged behind in terms of taking Spadina seriously, having a detailed checklist, and overall having a release ready before the genesis event,” the team said.  Ryan added the dress rehearsal’s load was tilted unfavorably toward Prysm, which took on the lion's share of the testnet’s users.  The same issue – stakers picking Prysm over the four other available Eth 2.0 clients – also presented itself during August’s Medalla testnet.

Since this time last year, the supply of stablecoins has exploded by more than 1,200 percent.  In May, the total stablecoin supply passed $10 billion for the first time, as CoinDesk reported, closing Q2 just below $12 billion.

USDC also joined tether as the only stablecoins with market capitalizations greater than $1 billion after adding $1.5 billion since the end of June.  According to Ardoino, the primary drivers of growth in the past quarter were the “explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi)” and a growing number of hedge funds and over-the-counter trading desks moving funds to tether for “faster arbitrage and reactions to market movements.”  Whether this stablecoin growth will continue is hard to predict, Ardoino said.

42432794,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1c9h,1601558332,First Mover: Nine (Bullish) Bitcoin Predictions for Final Months of (Awful) 2020,"A lot of crypto investors like to think of bitcoin as a bet on higher inflation, or as a futuristic hedge on some imagined economic-armageddon scenario – Gold 2.0, as they say.      Lately, it's looking more like Gold 2x: As bitcoin heads into the final months of 2020, the largest cryptocurrency's 2020 investment returns are twice those of the yellow metal.      Bitcoin gained 50% in the nine months through September versus gold's 25%, during a year when a global pandemic ravaged economies and prompted central banks to print trillions of dollars. Many investors, while acknowledging that recessions are usually deflationary, say the extra flood of money could eventually send consumer prices spiraling higher.      And bitcoin's performance looks especially stark when compared with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which has returned 3.5% this year. A gauge of the bond market's performance is up 19%.      CoinDesk's Bradley Keoun and Daniel Cawrey rounded up commentary from nine crypto analysts and investors going into the rest of the year. Global conditions could get better, or worse still, but the analysts are pretty bullish.      They may be wrong, and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett has said that bitcoin has ""no value,"" but the tone is strikingly different from the skepticism that many Wall Street analysts now express toward the lofty valuations in stock and bond markets.      Denis Vinokourov, Bequant: The market is testing the upper bounds of its recent range and, with the absence of fresh macro news flow that could dampen the risk on sentiment, bitcoin may just find enough momentum to break through the $11,000 price level and, more importantly, stay there. Open options interest continues to show signs of recovery.      Charlie Morris, ByteTree: The vast majority of bitcoin’s past gains coincided with periods of a flat or weak dollar. The implication is that bitcoin is likely to be a powerful hedge against U.S. dollar weakness. How likely is that? Quite likely given it is Fed policy.      IntoTheBlock: There are two areas of strong resistance for bitcoin based on on-chain data. The first one is the current resistance it is facing around the $11,000 mark, where 626K BTC has been bought by 1.17 million addresses. This creates resistance from many of these addresses looking to close their positions to break-even. After that, there is another similar resistance level between $11,400 and $11,700 as shown in the graph above. The good news is that past these resistance levels, there is likely to be less selling pressure past $12,000.      Matt Blom, Diginex: Despite the propensity to buy, hold and not move bitcoin, the network remains buoyed by growth. The only thing going sideways in bitcoin is the price.      Jason Lau, OKCoin: Bitcoin’s price momentum is still positive, with its pullbacks leaving higher highs. This is signaling a possible further continuation of this upwards move. Bitcoin perpetual swaps funding rates have started turning positive. This indicates that investors are more willing to go long at current price levels.      George McDonaugh, Keld van Schreven, Kr1 Plc: We are currently seeing some correlation [involving] bitcoin, other digital assets and movements in the equity and gold markets. We expect the trend of strengthening balance sheets and diversification into bitcoin to continue as the world’s monetary policies shift evermore towards unbridled money printing and higher inflation.      QCP Capital: The key support from the early month lows of $10,000 on BTC and $310 on ETH both saw substantial buying demand. This prevented any cascading short gamma selling into quarter-end, which had been our fear if those levels broke.      Constantin Kogan, BitBull Capital: We’re seeing a spike in activity by new participants coming into BTC not yet reflected in price. It doesn’t happen often. This is what traders call a divergence. In this case the trend looks more bullish.      Patrick Tan, Novum Alpha: While it may be tempting to subscribe to the notion that bitcoin will represent a safe haven in times of instability, there’s little evidence to support that view – especially since gold, tech stocks and bitcoin have all tracked each other closely this year. A further round of stimulus, or a smoother than expected political transition, could pave the way for bitcoin to move higher as politicians get past electing and get back to spending.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin is trading in the narrow range of $10,600 to $11,000 for the seventh straight day.      The long-term sentiment remains bullish, as evidenced by a continued decline in the number of coins held on cryptocurrency exchanges - a sign of investors shifting to holding strategies.

Announced Thursday, Dapper Labs is rolling out its blockchain-based collectibles game, NBA Top Shot, to the public. Currently in its beta version and developed in partnership with the National Basketball Association, Top Shot will also be available to U.S.-based Samsung users on the Galaxy app store.      Built using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) minted on the purpose-built Flow blockchain, Top Shot lets users collect, showcase and trade in-game “moments” which capture moves made on the real court.      For instance, a user can purchase a moment based on a James Harden dunk and showcase it, sell it or swap it for, say, a Steph Curry three-pointer.      The platform has managed to build a strong following under an invitation-only beta. Rolled out in May after scoring financial backing from a handful of NBA stars, the platform has since invited 17,000 users on board, recorded 158,000 transactions and raked in over $2 million in revenue, according to data shared with CoinDesk.    Gameplay options coming soon    NFTs are unique digital tokens that allow the issuer to embed identifying information about the item (be it fine art, selfies or a basketball clip) into the token’s smart contract while also maintaining a corresponding ownership ledger on the blockchain.      The embedded identifying information provides protection against the duplication of such items, and the ownership record ensures that users can verify who owns what and carry out transactions.      Read more: NBA's Spencer Dinwiddie, Andre Iguodala and More Join Dapper Labs $12M Funding Round      While Top Shot’s current interface uses NFTs to combine trading cards with digital clips, Dapper Labs also said it is developing a more immersive experience within Top Shot called “Hardcourt.”      “It's a 3D game where you control players on a basketball court,” Roham Gharegozlou, CEO of Dapper Labs, said in an interview. He explained that once a user has put together their team of desired players for the game, they could then use the “moments” they own to upgrade their players’ abilities.      “If I have a bunch of LeBron [James] dunks, I can train my Steph Curry to be as good at dunking as LeBron by equipping him with a lot of LeBron moments,” he said.      Read more: Dapper Labs–USDC Integration Helps NBA Collectibles Game Clear $2M in Revenue Since June      By adding this immersive interface to its platform, Dapper hopes to attract more mainstream users that have largely stayed away from the NFT-enabled gaming world.      “It’s a high graphical experience, because all of our user research showed that that’s what mainstream fans want to see,” said Gharegozlou, adding:    “Crypto fans would be OK with a trading card game or fantasy sports thing. But to actually go mainstream and have a game that tens of millions of people play every day, you need to kind of make it look as good as all the options that are out there.”    Dapper Labs said Hardcourt is under internal testing and is slated for release toward the end of Q4.      Notably, Top Shot allows users to make payments using both fiat (through credit cards) and cryptocurrencies. Even though credit cards and crypto payments make up equal shares of the platform’s revenue, credit cards account for three-quarters of all transactions made, according to data shared by Dapper Labs.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING | FLOW,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/01/dappers-nba-top-shot-launches-out-of-beta-with-samsung-galaxy-store-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40cecc71c0a08c160cc58757cdb4e43ca7011a1f-1500x1007.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432790,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1bvh,1601557205,CipherTrace Outlines Regulatory Gray Zones Plaguing Booming DeFi Sector,"The exploding decentralized finance (DeFi) space is now firmly on the radar of regulators and concerns are growing that it could become a magnet for criminal or nefarious activity, according to blockchain analytics provider CipherTrace.      DeFi has grown from a science project into a $11 billion market, one in which there appears to be almost zero know-your-customer (KYC) provision and a considerable risk of potential manipulation.      DeFi is such a young space, it’s hard to tell whether the sort of money-laundering activities typically associated with cryptocurrency mixing services will migrate there. But preliminary findings after the recent KuCoin hack suggest this new generation of decentralized exchange (DEXs) could be added to crypto mixers as an attractive service for crooks, said CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans.      “I think there's a lot of concern that these platforms can be used as effectively the next generation of money-laundering mixing services,” said Jevans. “If I can put my stuff into a DeFi contract, it gets mixed up with other people’s money when it comes back out. Because there’s no tracing and there’s no KYC, it effectively is operating as an old-school crypto money-laundering service.”      In the case of the KuCoin hack, the thieves used five DEXs – Uniswap, Kyber Network, DEX.AG, Tokenlon, and 1inch.exchange – and have so far sold over $17 million in tokens that could be frozen by the owners of their respective projects, according to analysis by crypto sleuthing service Elliptic.      Read more: Ocean Protocol Forks to Retrieve Tokens Stolen From KuCoin Exchange      But while these DeFi services are acting as a useful layer to exchange tokens, they are not actually covering the hacker’s tracks at this stage, said Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson.      “The hacker isn’t using DEXs to hide their tracks, they’re doing it so they can sell their stolen tokens,” Robinson said via email. “The token issuers (Tether, Ocean Protocol, etc.) are freezing accounts or reversing transactions associated with the stolen funds in order to aid their recovery. So the hacker needs to convert them into something like ether, which is much less likely to be taken from them.”    On mixers    Speaking hypothetically, there are some other interesting reasons why DeFi could benefit potential money launderers, said Jevans of CipherTrace. Ironically, interacting with a smart contract (computer programs that run on top of blockchains, and on which DeFi is based), could provide a layer of safety and security for the hacker, Jevans said.      “Because these are contracts, it’s much harder to get ripped off,” said Jevans. “Some of the mixing services, when they get sufficient volume, they pull an exit fraud and just basically stop working. That’s the way a bunch of these guys make money; they’ll charge low fees on mixing and wait until there are a few tens of millions in the hopper, then they just take off.”      Another risk for criminals using crypto mixers is the chance the service itself gets busted by law enforcement and the funds are seized.      Read more: 'Inherently Borderless': Acting OCC Chief Talks Crypto, State Licenses and DeFi      “We’ve seen a number of seizures and arrests. Well, if your money was in there at the time, I assure you, you’re not getting it back,” Jevans said.      And despite the fact that gas fees on Ethereum-based DeFi apps are becoming ridiculously high, it’s still cheaper than using a mixer, Jevans added.      “Mixers are expensive,” he said. “DeFi platforms present less risk and the fees are less, too. In my view, a DeFi platform is also better because you’re mixing your bad funds with a lot of good funds,” Jevans said, adding:    “I would argue that mixers – and this is just my opinion – have a disproportionately high amount of criminal activity going through them. Whereas DeFi has a lot of people who want to get in on the next investment trend.”    DEXs are very different from mixers because the flow of funds through them is clear to see on the blockchain, said Robinson of Elliptic.      “Mixers are used to break the blockchain trail by making it difficult or impossible to link incoming funds to outgoing funds,” Robinson said. “In contrast, this is very easy to do with DEXs – the operation of the smart contract is auditable on the blockchain, so the incoming transaction in one asset and the outgoing transaction in another asset, are clear to see.”    No KYC    DeFi platforms contribute a particular black spot on the overall crypto KYC landscape, the general topic of the report released Thursday by CipherTrace. But DeFi is undoubtedly on the regulatory radar, as evidenced by recent comments from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crypto czar Valerie Szczepanik.      “We’ve seen [DeFi] projects that are subject to vulnerabilities, attacks, hacks, manipulation,” Szczepanik said at the Parallel Summit on Sept. 18, 2020. “We’ve seen structures that purport to enable users to lend money, earn interest, borrow money, exchange, take positions; these are all financial activities and they are likely subject to various laws already, including securities law, potentially banking and lending laws – definitely AML/CTF laws.”      So are DeFi platforms thinking about adding KYC at any point in time? Jevans doesn’t think so.      “From what we have experienced over the last couple of months is that they don’t want to have anything to do with KYC,” Jevans said. “They just say they are writing software and, while they get beneficial funds from it, they are not ‘operating’ it. But it’s interesting to see what the governance of the platforms is, which often happens to be from venture capital-backed companies.”      Read more: DeFi Is Just Like the ICO Boom and Regulators Are Circling      Indeed, the CipherTrace report suggests this could be an avenue a regulator like the SEC might pursue, especially when faced with a U.S.-domiciled firm like Uniswap inhabiting a kind of decentralized lacuna.      “While the operations of DeFi exchanges are decentralized, the scale of the governance decentralization varies greatly. For instance, Uniswap – located in San Francisco – has received venture investment capital from Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures,” states the CipherTrace report.      Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures did not return requests for comment by press time.      “So there is a place to go if you are a lawmaker or a regulator,” said CipherTrace’s Jevans. “At the end of the day, all of the governance is centralized by a for-profit company.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | KNC | REGULATION | KSC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/01/ciphertrace-outlines-regulatory-gray-zones-plaguing-booming-defi-sector,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b941bde2b3bf2312709a35bee2f7f71a0304eaa-1500x975.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432787,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1c1h,1601552815,Bitcoin Posts Biggest Monthly Price Loss Since March,"Bitcoin faced selling pressure in September as the U.S. dollar rose against major currencies for the first time in six months.    Bitcoin fell by over 7% over the period, the biggest monthly percentage decline since March, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Back in March, prices fell by nearly 25% as the coronavirus-induced crash in the global equity markets triggered a global dash for cash, sending the dollar higher.  Bitcoin's latest monthly decline is again accompanied by an uptick in the greenback.  The Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against majors, gained nearly 1.8% in September – the first monthly rise since March.  ""BTC seems to be sensitive to a stronger dollar in the short term,"" Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk in an email.  Bitcoin has moved largely in the opposite direction to the DXY since the coronavirus crisis slammed markets in March.  The top cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin rallied from $3,867 to $12,400 in the five months to mid-August before falling back to $10,000 last month.  Heading the opposite way, the DXY topped out at 103.00 in March and fell to a 16-month low of 91.75 in August. The index rose back above 95.00 last month.  The S&P 500, Wall Street's equity index, and gold have moved more or less in lockstep with bitcoin over the past 6.5 months.  However, these correlations may be coincidental, according to Alfred – that is, the dollar has been influencing price action in the major markets as well as bitcoin.  The Federal Reserve's massive liquidity injections drove the dollar lower in the second quarter and the majority of the third quarter, yielding a rally in all major assets priced in the greenback.  As such, the DXY's corrective bounce in September put pressure on bitcoin, gold, and equities. The greenback looked at its most oversold in nearly 40 years during August.  Looking forward  Long-term sentiment remains bullish, as evidenced by a continued decline in the number of coins held on exchanges – a sign of investors shifting to holding strategies.  In the short run, the cryptocurrency could continue to take cues from the U.S. dollar and the stock markets.  ""We can't ignore the greenback's breakout from its recent consolidation and expect a continued rally in the dollar to weigh over BTC,"" said Matthew Dibb, CEO of Stack Funds.  Additional bearish pressure may emerge from potential outflows from tech-heavy stocks and the Nasdaq, Dibb added.  According to a tweet from chart analyst and trader Josh Rager, bitcoin's late September recovery from $10,000 to $10,800 has kept the bullish price structure intact.  Rager now foresees a green month for markets in October ahead of the U.S. elections.  At press time, bitcoin is trading near $10,888, up 1.93% on the day.

42432769,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO1XPh,1601551800,Why Hardnosed Bitcoiners Can Learn to Love DeFi,"I want to talk about stacking sats.      It’s a simple idea: accumulate wealth over time by growing your stack of bitcoin (BTC) and HODLing. People can stack by purchasing bitcoin regularly or earning it through work or rewards. The key is that it’s steady and deliberate, with an eye to the long term. If the vision of a decentralized economy is going to win out, it’s essential that bitcoin continues to be established as a primary means of saving and building wealth.      The concept of stacking eschews the wanton speculation of the initial coin offering boom, epitomized by “wen moon” and similar memes. It’s much more in line with the bedrock principles that underpin the “real economy.” The ability to save money is an essential component of any financial system. Establishing more avenues for people to get predictable but decent returns on their bitcoin is how we truly start to shift the way the world deals with money.      And that’s why bitcoiners who stack sats should take a hard look at the decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms seeing explosive growth on Ethereum. While the optics may call to mind the wild speculation of 2017, the truth is that much of the growth in DeFi is driven by the same sound money principles as stacking.      See also: What Is DeFi?    Supporting good projects wherever they are    Bitcoin’s usefulness and grounding as hard money set it apart from most of the crypto froth from the past several years. The ocean of Ethereum white papers produced has yielded comparatively few working projects, and even fewer that anyone outside the crypto world would call usable.      Regardless of Bitcoin’s advantages, I am on record saying that I am a monetary maximalist, not a Bitcoin maximalist. I believe finance is a human right, just like speech and assembly, and that we need a fair and transparent financial system that empowers individuals, not powerful middlemen. So while I believe in the soundness of Bitcoin and its ability to help reshape finance, I will support any project that furthers this ultimate vision for a new economic system.    Stacking sats is about steadily, gradually, doggedly accumulating wealth over time. And DeFi is in the same spirit when properly implemented.    The fact that Ethereum is not Bitcoin, that it has consistently driven hype and bubbles, and that it still has not found a workable long-term solution for scalability, does not mean it offers nothing of value. In fact, Ethereum’s top DeFi platforms are doing some truly exciting and innovative work, and they have the promise to further the cause of a decentralized future of money.      MakerDAO operates like a credit facility, driving liquidity and encouraging more lending when interest rates are low. Compound, with its developer-focused interest rate protocols, enables the savings and loan functions of traditional banks. In more arcane spheres, projects like Synthetix offer a version of derivatives trading. Together, these platforms represent the germ of a new financial system.      See also: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto's 'Weird DeFi' Moment    Seeds of a decentralized economy    At this point many of you that know me only as a Bitcoiner are rolling your eyes and drawing comparisons to ICOs and tulips. Projects with names like $YAM and $TENDIES do not inspire confidence, I know. But dig a little into what DeFi is and does, and the foundations that have been laid, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised. DeFi is very real, and it’s worth exploring and explaining.      Stacking sats is about steadily, gradually, doggedly accumulating wealth over time. And DeFi is in the same spirit when properly implemented (never a sure thing in the Ethereum community). It’s basic finance: DeFi lets people do things they already do through banks, mutual funds and other financial institutions. But done right, it offers these services in a way that’s fairer, more transparent and more rewarding. So it’s not an exaggeration to say that DeFi is an ally in achieving a vision it shares with bitcoin: a trustless world of democratized, self-sovereign finance.      It would be myopic and self-defeating to ignore the potential of DeFi to advance a goal that is, after all, shared by all of us. It would be even more self-defeating to ignore real opportunities to put money to work, like when there’s a way for BTC holders to earn through cross-chain bridges like tBTC.      As Bitcoiners, we will always believe in the importance of sound money and in the Bitcoin blockchain as the best technology to facilitate it. There is plenty of risk in Ethereum and in DeFi. Potential investors must always do their due diligence. But I’m here to tell you that DeFi is for real. It’s a bubble, but it’s not just another bubble. And although there absolutely are “DeFi” platforms that will crash and burn, many of the concepts are sound. There are real opportunities for people to earn by putting their money to work – and where that’s true, investment and growth will follow.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Matt Luongo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/01/why-hardnosed-bitcoiners-can-learn-to-love-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63891a96104c9fd337690bdbbdd20fd23c67d125-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform started out in 2018 and is backed by an impressive list of investors including Autonomous Partners, Castle Island Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and Initialized Capital.      Over the past year or so, Talos has been quietly onboarding a core group of capital market participants so that the platform can make its debut in a revenue-generating state, said Anton Katz, the firm’s co-founder and CEO.      “It’s not that we were really hiding, but it’s just that we come from a capital markets background and would tend to shy away from talking about things before they are ready; when you’re selling to institutions that can be frowned upon,” Katz said in an interview. “Now I think we have reached a good point, working with a good set of customers and the platform is in a more mature state.”      Talos provides tools to support clients through the full trading lifecycle, from price discovery through to clearing and settlement, the company said.      Read more: Behind 'Prime Broker' Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms      “One of the biggest keys to widespread institutional adoption of digital assets is a technology infrastructure that unites all market participants and gives them the confidence to operate at scale,” Arianna Simpson, founder of Autonomous Partners, said in a statement. “That is exactly what Talos has built, and we are excited to help them realize their ambitious launch and growth plans.”    Institutional herd    The last couple of years have seen much talk about an institutional herd moving imminently into crypto; how has this landscape changed in that time and have these expectations been met?      “I think it’s important to keep in mind that the institutional sector does not have an on/off switch,” said Katz. “It’s not like they’re either in or out. There are really a couple of different groups of institutions, some of them are a little bit more risk-averse, some of them less, and what we are seeing right now are less risk-averse players becoming the early adopters.”      Read more: This Ethereum Startup Is Building a ‘DeFi Firewall’ for Institutional Investors      The design requirements for crypto platforms are quite different from regular capital markets, Katz explained. On the pre-trade side of things, when compared to capital markets the data being collected for crypto is a lot less reliable and has to be collected in multiple places and cleaned properly.      In terms of trading there are things like a treasury management aspect, so moving capital between different exchanges, which again is something that doesn’t really exist in capital markets. While on the post-trade side, capital markets are much more secure and standardized.      “I would say you don’t have to be as defensive when you’re building your platforms in capital markets as you do in crypto,” said Katz. “The precision that you need with every single trade, it calls for completely different system design.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/01/institutional-crypto-platform-talos-emerges-from-stealth-mode,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76aa0e885f0d7ae478268f96153d9a53ac3eaac8-1500x824.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Per CoinDesk's price data, that comes to nearly $11.8 million for mining ether, and a further $664,000 for ethereum classic – approximately $12.4 million at time of writing.  The figures represent a near 30% increase from the 25,000 ETH that HIVE mined in the first quarter and a 50% increase on the same quarter in 2019.  HIVE said it currently costs around $150 to mine a single ether. Based on September's average ether price of $343, the company made approximately $193 in gross profit.  Going by the amount processed across the fiscal quarter, HIVE – which expanded its ETH mining capacity by 20% in March – made roughly $614,000 from ether.  HIVE attributes its bumper quarter to the fees charged over the summer, when surging interest in DeFi led to record transaction volumes on Ethereum.  As fees for processing transactions increase with volume, miner revenue increased considerably over the summer.  CoinDesk reported last month that miners made an estimated $16 million in a single day for confirming DeFi-related transactions on Ethereum.  Before the announcement, HIVE shares closed 5% down Wednesday at 0.35 CAD ($0.26).

Morrison announcedhttps://www.pm.gov.au/media/digital-business-plan-drive-australias-economic-recovery the news Tuesday, saying the funding is aimed to help the country's businesses recover from the economic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as create more jobs.  While Australia hasn't been hit as badly as nations like the U.S. and India by the virus, it has still seen around 27,000 cases and nearly 900 deaths in total, according to its official figures.  After seeing growth for a record 30 years, the coronavirus has now tipped the country into a recession as lockdowns sent spending spiraling.  The US$575 million investment, to be concreted in the 2020 budget, is part of Morrison's plan to bounce back from the pandemic.  In the announcement, he sets out that varying amounts will be spent on different prongs of the plan, including:  $256.6 million on a digital identity solution that will make it easier and more secure to interact with government services (and later, the private sector).  $419.9 million to fully implement the Modernizing Business Registers (MBR) program.  $22.2 million will go to help small businesses utilize digital technologies through tools and training made available under the Australian Small Business Advisory Service.  Blockchain technology gets a specific mention with a $6.9 million initiative that will see two pilots aimed to cut business compliance costs.  Other prongs include the accelerated rollout of 5G and industry trials of the technology, a ""regulatory technology commercialization initiative"" to improve compliance and support digital technology companies, and an effort to mandate the adoption of electronic invoicing by July 1, 2022, for government agencies.  “The Plan supports Australia’s economic recovery by removing out-dated regulatory barriers, boosting the capability of small businesses and backs the uptake of technology across the economy,” the prime minister said in the announcement.
