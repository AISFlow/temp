42381212,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Na5,1537296017,New York AG Report Faults Crypto Exchanges for Manipulation Risks,"The New York Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has released a report on cryptocurrency trading platforms, finding that many are vulnerable to market manipulation and referring several exchanges to another agency for potential violations of state law.  The NYAG's inquiry was launched in April, seeking voluntary participation from 13 of the world's most notable trading sites, including Coinbase, Kraken, Bitfinex, Bittrex, and Binance, among others. The process carried forward in spite of the refusal to participate from some exchanges as well as then-Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's resignation in May.  The newly-released Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative report drew issue with a number of practices put in place by the exchanges, including methods for monitoring and preventing market manipulation.  Indeed, the report states that several crypto trading platforms told the OAG that ""it was impossible"" to monitor or prevent market manipulation occurring on multiple platforms, meaning that exchanges are limited in their efforts to ""police abusive activity."" While noting that exchanges like Gemini are seeking the ability to monitor more effectively, ""some platforms do appear to be taking steps to improve surveillance.""  ""The industry has yet to implement serious market surveillance capacities, akin to those of traditional trading venues, to detect and punish suspicious trading activity,"" the NYAG report contended. ""A platform cannot take action to protect customers from market manipulation and other abuses if it is not aware of those practices in the first place.""  The report also took aim at Kraken, which declined to participate and blasted the NYAG effort in a fiery public statement in April, stating:  ""The OAG could not review the practices and procedures of non-participating platforms (Binance, Gate.io, Huobi, and Kraken) concerning manipulative or abusive trading. However, the Kraken platform's public response is alarming. In announcing the company's decision not to participate in the Initiative, Kraken declared that market manipulation 'doesn't matter to most crypto traders,' even while admitting that 'scams are rampant"" in the industry.'""  Findings on New York operation, self-trading  The wide-ranging report covered a range of topics, including whether the exchanges in question are allowed to operate in New York – and if they are doing so even without permission.  Notably, the report said that Binance, Gate.io and Kraken had been referred to the state's Department of Financial Services after an investigation into whether those exchanges are operating in New York. A fourth exchange, Huobi, was also investigated but not referred.  ""The OAG investigated whether those platforms accepted trades from within New York State. Based on this investigation, the OAG referred Binance, Gate.io, and Kraken to the Department of Financial Services for potential violation of New York's virtual currency regulations,"" the report stated.  The NYAG's office found that some exchanges could quantify how much trading activity on their platforms came from their own operations. Circle said it was responsible for less than 1 percent of the trading volume on Poloniex while BitFlyer USA conducts roughly 10 percent of the trades on its platform.  Notably, ""Coinbase disclosed that almost 20 percent of executed volume on its platform was attributable to its own trading.""  The report also noted that while most exchanges use know-your-customer procedures, Bitfinex and Tidex do not, ""requiring little more than an email address to begin trading virtual currencies."" However, the report did not offer a comment on any legal issues this may cause.

The twist marks the latest in the company's efforts to raise $50 million from accredited investors, which it announced last month.  At the time, High Times said in a press release that it would accept bitcoin as a payment method for the fundraise. However, just days later the company reversed its stance in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), saying that the press release announcing that bitcoin would be accepted ""was distributed in error.""  Despite this filing, the company continued to accept bitcoin and ethereum as payment options, a spokesperson later told CoinDesk, though the company did not hold any cryptocurrencies. Rather, a third-party processor converted the cryptocurrencies into U.S. dollars, which were then sent to High Times.  ""They issued the release to make the SEC happy,"" the spokesperson said at the time.  Now, the bitcoin payment option has been removed entirely from the company's investors page.  It is unclear what caused the latest reversal. However, another SEC filing shows that the IPO – which was originally set to end on September 12 – has been extended through to October 31.

42381235,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94NvT,1537283705,XRP Price Bucks Bearish Market Mood to Hit 13-Day High,"XRP is reporting double-digit gains today, despite a generally bearish mood across the wider crypto markets.  The open-source token – which is developed largely by blockchain payments startup Ripple – was changing hands at $0.3251 at press time, having hit a 13-day high of $0.3241 at 14:00 UTC.  The world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated by 17 percent in the last 24 hours and is the second best-performing cryptocurrency among top 100 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap.  A major part of the rally, though, materialized in the couple of hours before publication – a surprising move, as the broader market is looking very risk averse. For instance, bitcoin is down 1 percent at $6,370, while 81 out of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are reporting losses.  Some in the investor community are associating XRP's gains with reports stating that Ripple's xRapid product – which uses the digital asset – could go live in the next month or so. The news may have put a bid under the oversold cryptocurrency, which is currently down 90 percent from the record high of $3.30 hit in January.  XRP has also seen a 72 percent rise in trading volume, backing up that theory. At press time, 24-hour trading volume stands at $458 million – the highest level since Aug. 17.  Over on the technical charts, XRP is teasing a long-term bullish reversal.  Daily chart  As can be seen, XRP is still trapped in a falling channel (bearish pattern).  A UTC close above the confluence of the 50-day moving average and the top end of the falling channel, currently located at $0.3282, would confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change and could yield further gains.  The relative strength index (RSI) has turned bullish by moving above 50.00.  View  XRP's sharp rally has neutralized the bearish outlook for now, though the sustainability of the rally is uncertain.  A close above $0.3282 is needed to confirm a bullish breakout and set the tone for a move higher to $0.424 (June 29 low).  On the downside, $0.252 (Sept. 11 low) is the level to beat for the bears.

Called Trust ID Network, Gemalto said the new platform will provide users with more control over how and when their personal data is shared with third parties, and that such ""self-sovereign"" identities will make on-boarding at different online services more private and secure.  According to statements, Gemalto is hoping to get financial institutions and other stakeholders to join the pilot project, which expected to launch later this year.  The Trust ID Network has been built using the latest version of R3's Corda blockchain platform, which offers a suite of in-built tools and is designed to streamline integration for service providers.  David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, said in a press statement:  ""Empowering customers to manage and control their own digital identity based on blockchain technology is nothing short of revolutionary ... The Corda platform's unique privacy features offer the ideal basis for a secure, easy-to-deploy decentralized ID management platform.""  The network addresses the ""profound weaknesses"" of traditional identity frameworks, according to Bertrand Knopf, Gemalto's EVP Banking & Payment. These offer a poor user experience and face rising costs and challenges in complying with increasingly strict regulations, he said.  While financial institutions are well-placed to lead a shift to self-sovereign identities for customers, ""it will prove similarly attractive to a wide array of other service providers,"" Knopf concluded.  The identity use case for blockchain technology is one that is already being addressed in partnerships with R3.  In late June, a group of banks and regulators, including BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, announced they were conducting conducted a trial of a know-your-customer (KYC) compliance app also built on Corda.  The trial saw 39 participants put the system, built by tech firm Synechron, conducting over 300 transactions from 19 different countries across eight time zones.  Last November, 10 major banks – all members of the R3 consortium – also tested a blockchain-based KYC registry allowing the participants to create and manage digital identities within a shared system.

42381227,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94NpB,1537275547,This DEX Is Enabling Merchant Payments in Any Ethereum Token,"119,876 – that's how many ethereum ERC-20 tokens are currently in existence.  It's a number that is growing by the hundreds every day, but the trouble is, according to Loi Luu, the CEO and co-founder of decentralized exchange Kyber Network, the majority of those tokens fall short of a practical use case.  ""What we observe is that most tokens are used only on exchanges for trading purposes or within their own specific platforms if the platform is live,"" Luu said.  Luu wants to change that and unlock the potential of ERC-20 tokens to be used for payments.  And to do that, Luu revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Kyber Network will be extending the on-chain liquidity smart contract which underlies its decentralized exchange to allow businesses to accept payments through any ERC-20 out there.  Luu told CoinDesk, ""Our main goal is to make tokens usable anywhere.""  In practice, this means businesses can accept payments in any ethereum token, and that token can be instantly converted into any other token as well.  And Luu has some experience to back up their ambition. For one, he's known for founding ethereum security tool Oyente and building a protocol that uses a scaling solution, sharding, for the enterprise blockchain Zilliqa, before going on it found Kyber Network, that facilitates instant ethereum token swaps on its decentralized exchange (a term, while long a dream in the industry, has failed as of yet to live up to expectations).  ""With Kyber we aim to connect between ERC-20 tokens and use cases, so tokens can be seamlessly used for payments, as collateral for lending, investing in funds and so on,"" Luu said. ""This will definitely create more use cases for tokens.""  And according to Luu, Kyber Network has already secured partnerships with leading ethereum game, Etheremon, popular wallets MyEtherWallet and Coinbase, and ethereum-based microblogging site Peepeth to integrate Kyber.  ""Anyone can integrate, with no gatekeepers dictating innovation,"" Luu explained, adding:  ""Done right, this protocol can be the transaction layer for the decentralized economy, facilitating value exchange across all parts of the decentralized ecosystem.""  Kyber Network also announced today a developer grant that Luu said will ""provide financial support to projects built in and around Kyber's on-chain liquidity protocol.""  And already, startups Canal and MoatFund are getting grant money.  Liquidity contracts  The key technical problem that the crypto industry faces is liquidity – a term that relates to the availability and stability of cryptocurrencies.  Liquidity has been the focus of Luu's research for many years, and it's what initiated his foray into Kyber Network, that allows for seamless trades between different kinds of tokens. Indeed, Luu's adaptation of Kyber to the business world isn't much of a deviation from the tech underlying the DEX. Rather, it's just an extension of the tech into a wider use case.  ""In terms of technical architecture, it's not different,"" Luu told CoinDesk. ""The decentralized exchange was one use case of the on-chain liquidity protocol; it's just one way to utilize the on-chain liquidity protocol that we have been building so far.""  Stepping back, the Kyber contract has two essential components.  On the one hand, there's the aspect of the contract that deals with instant conversions between tokens, and on the other, there's what is known as the ""Kyber reserve."" So-called ""liquidity providers"" commit tokens and ETH, the native cryptocurrency of ethereum, into a pool that is used to fuel the remainder of the contract.  Because all this happens on-chain — meaning stored in a smart contract hosted on the ethereum blockchain — it doesn't rely on a trusted intermediary in order to execute trades.  Luu told CoinDesk, ""These properties are critical to an open protocol since they allow permissionless innovation and trustless collaboration to happen between all the parties seeking the value exchange.""  Many (d)applications  Users that commit tokens to the pool can withdraw funds at any time.  While this might seem worrisome to crypto enthusiasts, especially after decentralized exchange and token creation platform Bancor suffered a $13.5 million hack, according to Luu, the Kyber contract has undergone rigorous security testing to ensure funds are safe in the code.  As well as having undergone multiple audits, the Kyber contract is built in such a way that liquidity providers are still in control of their finances, so even if there was a security breach, users cannot lose funds.  According to Luu, it's for these reasons that the technology will power many experimental payment solutions for businesses and financial services.  ""This protocol enables many transactional and payment flows to happen atomically and in a single step between multiple parties,"" Luu told CoinDesk. ""These use cases would otherwise be very difficult or impossible to achieve.""  Making it so that commerce can accept multiple tokens simultaneously and seamlessly convert these tokens into other crypto tokens, Luu anticipates the technology will be highly useful for the decentralized applications (dapps) in the ethereum ecosystem as well.

42381225,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Nmf,1537272001,Novel Botnet Hunts Down and Destroys Crypto Mining Malware,"Security researchers have discovered a new botnet that, rather than posing a threat, seems to be seeking out and destroying a type of crypto-mining malware.  Called Fbot, the botnet is a variant of one called Satori, which is in turn based on Mirai – a program normally used for DDoS attacks. Unusually, the DDoS module seems to have been deactivated and instead Fbot searches for devices infected with a specific crypto-jacking malware and replaces it in the system, the report says.  Discovered by the team at Qihoo 360Netlab, the variant seeks out a malware form dubbed com.ufo.miner – a variant of Android-based monero miner ADB.Miner.  Distributing itself by searching for devices with a specific open port, the botnet then uses a script to uninstall com.ufo.miner, if found. Fbot is programmed to scan and propagate, install itself over the malware and ultimately self-destruct, the researchers say.  Also unusually, the botnet code is linked to a domain name accessible, not through a standard domain name system (DNS), but a decentralized alternative called EmerDNS that makes addresses harder to trace and shut down.  The researchers said:  ""The choice of Fbot using EmerDNS other than traditional DNS is pretty interesting, it raised the bar for security researcher to find and track the botnet (security systems will fail if they only look for traditional DNS names).""  It is not yet clear if Fbot has been set up by someone with good intentions or by a rival crypto-jacker seeking to remove the competition.  The prevalence of crypto mining malware has shot up in the last year, according to various security teams, and has been found globally on systems owned by enterprises and governments, as well as individuals. Further, the previous crybercrime tool of choice, ransomware, has now taken a back seat amid the surge.  Indeed, IT security firm Trend Micro reported in late August, crypto-jacking attacks spiked by 956 percent from the first half of 2017 to the first half of 2018.  Among current initiatives to counter the rising threat, Firefox said on Aug. 31 that its browsers will soon automatically block crypto mining malware scripts. The Opera browser launched similar protection for mobile devices in January.  Hat tip Bleeping Computer.

42381241,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Nxz,1537268412,Bitcoin Price Outlook Worsens After Drop to Five-Day Lows,"Bitcoin's (BTC) drop to five-day lows on Monday has likely emboldened the bears, technical studies indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency traded in a sideways manner over the weekend, neutralizing the immediate bullish outlook. However, the consolidation was expected to end with an upside break, as the short-term moving averages (MAs) turned bullish on Saturday, adding credence to positive relative strength index divergence (RSI).  Instead, BTC dived out of the trading range in the US session yesterday and fell to a low of $6,203 – the lowest level since Sept. 12 – indicating the corrective rally from the recent lows near $6,100 has likely ended at Friday's high of $6,600.  More importantly, the drop witnessed yesterday signaled a revival of the sell-off from highs above $7,400 seen earlier this month.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,250 on Bitfinex – down 3 percent on a 24-hour basis.  4-hour chart  The bear flag breakdown seen in the above chart is a bearish continuation pattern, meaning the sell-off from the Sept. 2 high of $7,429 has resumed and prices could fall as low as $5,000 (target as per the measured move method).  However, that target looks far-fetched for now. Nevertheless, with RSI at 34.00 (bearish and well above the oversold level), the bear flag breakdown could yield a drop to the August low of $5,859 in the near-term.  The bearish outlook would gain more credence if BTC finds acceptance below the key trendline support, as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  As can be seen, the trendline connecting the June 24 low and Aug. 11 low capped the downside in BTC earlier this month and is living up to its reputation as a key support today.  That said, the probability of a downside break is high this time, as BTC suffered a bear flag breakdown on the 4-hour chart and created a bearish outside-day candle yesterday, putting the bears back into the driver's seat.  A UTC close below the trendline support, currently seen at $6,214, would confirm a downside break of the large pennant pattern and accentuate the bearish pressure.  View  BTC risks a downside break of the pennant pattern in the next 24 hours, having suffered a bear flag breakdown yesterday.  A confirmation of the pennant breakdown could yield a sell-off to $5,755 (June low).  On the higher side, $6,600 (Friday's high) is the level to beat for the bulls.

42381230,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94NqR,1537243409,Palestinians Are Using Bitcoin to Transact Across Borders Amid Conflict,"For a small but growing community of users in the Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, bitcoin has become a lifeline.  Ahmed Ismail, a financial analyst in Gaza, estimated there are at least 20 unofficial ""exchange"" offices there dealing cryptocurrency to local users. Ismail himself helps 30 clients use bitcoin to purchase investments abroad, such as stocks, since there aren't any local alternatives for putting money to work.  One such currency dealer in Gaza, Mohammed, told CoinDesk over the past four years he helped up to 50 families a month purchase an average of $500 worth of bitcoin each to send money abroad or shop online.  ""Bitcoin, in their opinion, is cheaper, safer, and quicker,"" he said. ""Nothing works with Palestinian banks. Bitcoin wallets are alternative banks.""  While Palestine is not the only politically and economically isolated part of the world where cryptocurrency is making inroads, it's somewhat unique among these markets in terms of the drivers – and limitations – to adoption.  For example, Palestinians do not face the kind of hyperinflation that drives Venezuelans, Iranians and Turks to hodl a digital currency with a limited supply, since they don't have a national currency at all, instead using stable foreign currencies.  But another core property of public blockchain networks is particularly appealing in the Palestinian territories: censorship-resistance.  Anyone can conduct a peer-to-peer bitcoin transaction. Once the transaction is paid for, it can't be vetoed by an intermediary. This would appear to solve a real problem for a population with restricted access to the global economy amid the ongoing conflict with Israel. Even supporters in the West have had their bank accounts shut down for sending money to Palestinians.  ""There is no payment gateway, like PayPal, for entrepreneurs to receive payments internationally,"" Laith Kassis, CEO of the nonprofit Palestine Techno Park in the West Bank, told CoinDesk. ""So here comes solutions on blockchain with private nodes.""  (The local alternative, PalPay, predominantly serves Bank of Palestine customers rather than offering a gateway to global commerce.)  However, an electronic currency can only do so much in a place where power outages can be a daily occurrence and even traditional banks sometimes struggle to transact with much of the outside world.  Facts on the ground  While sending or receiving bitcoin may be frictionless, on- and off-ramps just don't exist in the Palestinian territories.  There's no way for Palestinians to get their Israeli shekels, U.S. dollars or Jordanian dinars to online crypto exchanges since none of them work with local banks. Hence, they must rely on dealers as liquidity gateways, and that adds friction back in.  One Palestinian tech worker told CoinDesk that when she tried to cash out a bitcoin payment from a remote employer, she couldn't get a fair fiat price from dealers in Gaza because crypto prices were soaring at the time.  As such, Saifdean Ammous, the Palestinian-born author of ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" is skeptical about any claims that the cryptocurrency currently offers a solution to his homeland's economic straits.  ""If the people who want to do the transaction don't both have balances in bitcoin then you're just adding extra layers of conversion from their home currency to bitcoin and back to the home currency,"" said Ammous, who is a professor of economics at the Lebanese American University. ""That's never going to be a sustainable solution.""  Another non-starter, in his view, is the Palestinian Monetary Authority's publicly touted plans to create a national cryptocurrency. Ammous said it ""completely misses the point to think of bitcoin as a payment solution that can be added onto existing monetary systems.""  He added:  ""Rather, it [bitcoin] is its own monetary system and it will have its own payment solutions.""  Plus, Palestinian communities revolve around local trust networks and physical assets like cash, because high unemployment and poverty rates create urgent daily needs. According to World Bank estimates, 21 percent of Palestinians live below the poverty line on less than $5.50 a day.  In that context, volatile and illiquid assets are predominately useful for cross-border transactions, but not everyday ones.  Crypto nationalism  On the other hand, tech industry optimists like Kassis take a different approach than Ammous or Ismail by engaging with the PMA.  Kassis's Techno Park hosted its first blockchain boot camp the first week of September, with 29 participants ranging from students to entrepreneurs and government officials. By the end of the five-day technical boot camp, several developers were working on new applications. Representatives of the PMA have participated in the center's educational programming.  ""The whole ethos of decentralized ledgers plays into the [Palestinian] community's need to talk peer-to-peer, that will enable Palestinian entrepreneurs to do business internationally,"" Kassis said, adding:  ""I think blockchain and fintech has a huge potential to change the dynamics of our economy and solve many of the financial constraints [by] leveraging the decentralization of the network.""  Kassis said he hopes upcoming programs like the Techno Park crypto hackathon later this year will leverage Diaspora connections to foster local expertise for institutional payment solutions.  So far, the Techno Park's blockchain seminars at four universities across the West Bank have discussed government-sponsored pilots, enterprise crypto services provided by companies like Ripple, and initial coin offerings, in addition to bitcoin.  ""It's all about bringing awareness and creating new markets,"" Kassis said. ""The younger generation is more knowledgeable about crypto, more than the IT departments at banks.""  And even if it's too soon for bitcoin to make much difference now, Ammous said he believes that in the long term it has great potential to spark societal change.  Ammous argues that governments, including those in the Middle East, have been able to fund destructive ideas, such as wars, precisely because of their ability to issue unbacked fiat via central banks.  ""The key thing is that the more it [bitcoin] grows, the more it will deprive governments of the ability to print more money,"" Ammous said, concluding:  ""I think, in the long run, this is going to be a very good thing for everywhere in the world, particularly places in the Middle East.""
