42389283,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJtaY,1621897687,Of Course China Is Anti-Bitcoin: Look What Happened to Jack Ma,"Every bitcoin crash has many parents. In the current bloodletting (total cryptocurrency market cap is down 40% in less than two weeks), China’s recent threat of a crackdown on cryptocurrency certainly seems to be one. But feeding a crypto crash was strictly a side effect of a much broader story: a quest for total control over the financial lives of Chinese subjects.      Over the past year to two years, China’s rulers have engaged in a series of moves clearly designed to clamp down, not on cryptocurrency specifically, but on open financial systems more generally. That included a brutal rebuff of Jack Ma, one of the world's richest men, as well as the development of the digital yuan, which reportedly has strong built-in surveillance and censorship features.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    In the past, China’s crypto hesitancy has often seemed at least partly about protecting its populace from scams and theft. But in the context of this broader maneuvering for financial control, the latest round of clampdowns could be seen as a turning point as the state shifts its focus from defending its people to defending its own power.      To start with the current facts: On May 18, China reiterated existing restrictions on crypto for banks and payment providers. On Friday, May 22, Chinese Vice Oremier Liu He hosted a meeting of an important financial regulatory committee. In a subsequent statement, Liu and the committee called for a crackdown on “cryptocurrency mining and trading activities” in China. The statement on mining and trading was both novel and notable for Liu’s high rank.      It has had an immediate effect: Mining businesses, including HashCow and BTC.Top, had begun to wind down mining operations by Monday, according to Reuters and Al Jazeera. Scattered rumors suggest that Chinese miners are relocating to nearby sites, including Kazakhstan, and that mining equipment is showing up at local auctions in large amounts.      (Bitcoin’s network hash rate, a measure of the number and power of machines mining bitcoin, has also dropped by roughly 15% in the past week. However, it seems likely that just a small portion of that is due to China’s policy shift because dropping bitcoin prices always push less-profitable miners off the network worldwide. Matthew Graham of China-focused blockchain investment fund Sino-Global Capital, for one, says the hash rate drop-off isn’t due to the crackdown.)      You might notice something strange in the timeline of Liu’s declaration: No laws have been passed, no formal legislative processes put in motion. Just a statement from a committee meeting in the form of a mere policy recommendation. In the U.S., such a statement would be seen as an opportunity for a legislator to stake a position or a way to signal firms to prepare for future change.    Read more: David Z. Morris: Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn’t Need a Savior    But in China, the statement often effectively is the policy: the instant declaration of a new status quo. That’s why Chinese miners started going offline within days of the committee declaration instead of waiting for any more formal process. (I seriously doubt any of the Chinese Communist Party nomenklatura who set the regulatory and legislative agenda in China are doing a lot of working through the weekend.)      The risks of failing to read such tea leaves were on stark display in November when the CCP jerked the leash of one of the most powerful men on the planet, Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Ma had been readying an initial public offering of Ant Group, a fintech spin-off of Alibaba, when people suddenly noticed he hadn’t made a recent public appearance. Then, on Nov. 6, at nearly the last possible moment, authorities summarily cancelled the expected $34 billion offering. In addition to investor losses, the intervention personally cost Ma billions of dollars.      The cited reason for the halt was the need for tighter regulatory scrutiny of financial markets and technology, presumably including Ant Group’s hugely popular Alipay app, a predecessor to Apple Pay and similar services. But it was also seen as a symbolic smackdown of Ma, who just a month before the IPO gave a speech strongly critical of Chinese financial regulators.    When even a multibillionaire like Jack Ma can be taken out of the game at any time, a system that nobody controls becomes even more valuable.    Ma’s mysterious disappearance ultimately lasted three months; he finally resurfaced in a brief video in January 2021. One observer described that short clip as “like a hostage video,” and it may almost literally have been. This is the CCP’s treatment of a man with a net worth of about $46 billion as soon as he looks like a threat to its control.      Something notably similar, though both milder and weirder, happened to Justin Sun, founder of Ethereum imitator Tron, after he paid $4.6 million to have lunch with Warren Buffet. Sun heavily touted the lunch as a victory beforehand, inviting skepticism when Sun later announced that he would have to delay it because of kidney stones.      It didn’t make things more reassuring when Sun declared himself recovered the next day. Subsequent reporting found that the real sickness was Communism, with heavy CCP pressure reportedly figuring in Sun’s cancellation of the lunch. In a subtitle to its reporting, The New York Times bluntly described China as a place “where executives sometimes vanish.”      Sun later issued a statement apologizing for being, in effect, too shameless a promoter of his company. Some read this as a sign that putting Sun on punishment was largely an anti-scam effort by the CCP at a time when a lot of Chinese people were getting ripped off by pyramid schemes and other fraud. The dinner finally took place in February 2020.    China crypto truths    All this speaks to two important truths to remember about China and cryptocurrency.      First is the regulatory landscape. When observed from a distance, China can resemble a modern nation-state operated according to the rule of law. But it is, ultimately, an authoritarian one-party state, and increasingly over the past decade a personal dictatorship under Xi Jinping. That means changing stances from either the CCP or Xi don’t necessarily have to pass through any real legislative process to become the new rule on the ground. Instead, what would be considered informal or preliminary signals elsewhere – such as committee minutes – are treated like gospel and acted on immediately by any CEO who doesn’t want to wind up in a literal dungeon.      One generous interpretation of this is that Chinese policymaking is “experimental,” allowing for more flexibility than a rule of law-based approach – because, of course, all these proclamations can be reversed any time. But it also means private sector businesspeople, including most entrepreneurs, lack predictable conditions for planning. Overall, it’s hard not to infer that China’s lack of democratic due process increases the risk and volatility of doing business there.      Second, and closely related, China is engaged in a much broader attempt to create an innovative economy within an authoritarian society. The case of Ant Group shows how difficult that is: Would-be innovators have to judge exactly how much they can dare to innovate while relying not on clear-cut laws and policies but a more numinous sense of the prevailing sentiment among CCP leadership at any given moment. They seem to be moving closer to deciding that cryptocurrency isn’t entirely compatible with that fine balance, but that, above all, means more opportunity for innovators in more free societies.      China’s new pullback may justify short-term caution among global cryptocurrency investors – it seems at the least to have reshuffled the playing field. But if anything, the broader pattern shows why bitcoin and crypto are so important and attractive in the long term. When even a multibillionaire like Jack Ma can be taken out of the game at any time, a system that nobody controls becomes even more valuable.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,David Z.

42389276,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJtFA,1621893687,3 Things You Need to Know About China's Crypto Crackdown,"Crypto exchanges and miners in China are grappling with the aftermath of last Friday’s notice from the State Council, which calls for a crackdown on crypto trading and mining in the country. Here are some of the results of the warning.    Mining    Chinese miners have been scrambling to look for overseas sites to host their mining machines following the State Council’s warning that it may crack down on crypto mining due to environmental concerns.      “I have been having conversations all weekend, starting since last Friday, with Chinese miners looking to co-locate in the U.S.,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at Seattle-based mining firm Luxor. “All the Chinese miners that I know are reaching out, they are getting pricing and quotes.”      While the Chinese authorities have yet to release any concrete plans to enforce the crackdown, some major crypto mining companies are already taking steps in response to the warning.      Cryptocurrency exchange Huobi has shuttered its miner hosting services in mainland China. Crypto mining pool BTC.TOP suspended its operations in China and HashCow said it will stop buying new rigs.      “I think the consensus right now is there are too many uncertainties to tell if this is actually going to take place or not,” Vera said. “But there is for sure the risk of it.”      If China enforces the crackdown, the migration to hosting sites abroad could be costly and take a lot of time.      There is not much idle capacity in major mining hubs such as North America and Kazakhstan, Vera said. He estimated the idle capacity in the U.S. is less than 30 megawatts in the entire country at the moment. To put the number in perspective, that is less than 1% of the hash power required to support all the mining machines that are currently in China, according to Vera.      Chinese miners cannot move to these overseas sites and start mining right away. It would take between 60 and 90 days for a mining farm to build out another 10 or 20 megawatts, Vera said, noting the base rate for these hosting sites would be very high. So after moving it could take up to half a year before all that hashrate comes back online.      In the long run, crypto mining will continue to exist in China but will shift from industrial-size data centers to home miners or small or medium-sized miners, Zhuoer Jiang, CEO of BTC.TOP said on Twitter.      Jiang noted in his tweet that miner makers such as Bitmain would sell most of their machines abroad as the regulations on big-scale mining operations are getting tougher.    Exchanges pull back    Huobi, a major crypto exchange that provides trading services for Chinese investors, has scaled back its offerings following the State Council’s notice.      While Huobi’s spot trading remains largely unaffected, it has suspended futures contracts, exchange-traded products (ETP) and certain other leveraged investment products.      “The move indicates that the Chinese authorities are trying to prevent more capital from flowing into a more volatile market with high systemic risks,” Jason Wu, CEO of crypto lending platform DeFiner. “If you look at what exact services have been suspended on Huobi, they are among the most risky trading activities.”      Leveraged investment products, including ETPs, on crypto exchanges let investors amplify their profits by giving them up to 100 times the amount of cryptocurrencies they actually have on hand. But when prices in the crypto assets that are collateralized decrease, these investors need to put in more as collateral. Their assets will be liquidated if they can not add enough to the collateral.      Financial stability is one of the top priorities for Chinese regulators, and they might not want to see more people investing in such a volatile market.      Compared to the crackdowns in 2013 and 2017, crypto trading in general has become much more leveraged given the boom in financial derivative products in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi).      The rise of more sophisticated structured financial products on centralized exchanges and lending protocols in DeFi has made it easier to do leveraged trading, Wu said.      OKEx, which is another major exchange for Chinese investors, had planned to suspend transactions between its platform token OKB and China’s local fiat currency renminbi. The exchange later aborted the plan due to “customer concerns.” The token’s price fell as low as 70% after they announced the suspension.      This is a less-noticeable move given the low volume of transactions for OKB. But such transactions have a significant legal risk for exchanges.      “Platform tokens can be regarded as a form of illegal fundraising,” Wu said. “Imagine a centralized trading platform is a company, the platform token in nature is similar to its stocks.”      Some exchanges would require the users to hold their platform tokens in exchange for discounted transaction fees and other premium services.    State media’s rant    The Economic Information Daily, a state newspaper that covers Chinese securities, published an article on Monday giving more details on why the Chinese government is intensifying the crackdown on crypto mining and trading businesses.      Crypto’s biggest risks include more interest from average Chinese investors, financial risks associated with high leverage, security concerns with crypto trading platforms and compliance issues related to money laundering and illegal fundraising, the newspaper said.      As for the crackdown on mining, the media outlet said it is mainly due to environmental concerns. However, the newspaper’s characterization of data centers that are used as crypto mining sites indicates the discrepancy in the local and central government’s stance on crypto mining.      “Bitcoin mining activities tend to be in the disguise of data centers so that the miners can trick local governments into supporting such projects and waste a lot of electricity,” the newspaper said. But many local governments are aware of large-scale mining operations, some of which even put forward preferential policies for bitcoin miners.      A few counties in Sichuan province of South China, which is a major mining hub, have set up hydropower consumption parks, where many large bitcoin mining companies run their operations. Bitcoin mining operations have existed in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang for several years.      Local governments’ more permissive attitude towards crypto mining may be due to its pursuit of higher tax revenues, while the central government prioritizes environmental protection.      Compared to the crackdown notice on Tuesday from three financial industry associations, the warning from the State Council, which is a higher-level government body, will deter more people from operating crypto trading or mining businesses, the newspaper said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/24/3-things-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-crypto-crackdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e99106a9852f3bbb36e1b9c675504d0e66c52527-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42389296,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJu6d,1621892371,Polkadot Weighs Multichain Tech Challenges Ahead of DOT 'Parachain' Auctions,"Decentralization is all about trade-offs.      Polkadot, for example, was designed to carry a heavier transaction load than Ethereum. But simply “spreading out,” as Polkadot’s system of interconnected parachains does, comes with its own set of challenges. That’s what Web3 Foundation technical lead Joe Petrowski said Monday during CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference, explaining how the Polkadot builder is going about its business in 2021.      The explosion in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) has left people crying out for faster, cheaper alternatives to Ethereum. But the next stage of building a system where applications are interoperable across chains and transaction processing happens in parallel is a step into the unknown, admitted Petrowski.      Ethereum can be thought of as a single-thread blockchain, which is convenient as far as state changes are concerned, but means users compete for synchronous execution time. The result we are all now seeing is very high transaction fees. Block space is at a premium.      On the other hand, a multichain future invites untold complexity.      “As far as multichain apps, which I definitely see coming with asynchrony, it's a big problem,” Petrowski said. “It's a totally different application programming paradigm. So, spreading out is great, but also requires some new thinking on the part of developers who are using it.”    Read more: DeFi Conglomerate Equilibrium Raises $8.5M to Win a Place on Polkadot    Petrowski gave the simple example of a block explorer: For instance, a transaction done using some Ethereum application like Uniswap results in Etherscan showing everything that changed in that one transaction.      “If you think about a multichain application, then you could have one transaction actually trigger a bunch of different state changes on different blockchains,” Petrowski said. “So how do you go about having some kind of explorer that says, ‘Well, I made this transaction, can you show me everything in the blockchain universe that was affected because of this?’”    Wen auctions?    Polkadot, which was founded in 2016 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, is slated to go fully live later this year.      The next stage in the development process involves the launch of parachain auctions, a fundraising process where projects lock up 1 million DOT to win one of 100 or so coveted parachain slots.      Before the auctions can commence, Polkadot’s various testnets need to be up to speed when it comes to finalizing blocks, said Petrowski. For now, a shell parachain on canary network Kusama is producing blocks every three or four minutes.      “I think once Kusama is producing blocks at about the 12-second rate for the shell parachain, then we'll be able to publish the auction timetable and open that up,” Petrowski said.",NEUTRAL,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/24/polkadot-weighs-multichain-tech-challenges-ahead-of-dot-parachain-auctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2060ae311fba4e9139e8a5974fe44105e4a731bb-1280x876.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Less than 1% of institutions globally actually carry crypto as an asset class, he noted, and for that to change miners need to prove their coins are created sustainably, O’Leary said.      “Most of these institutions have both ethics and sustainability committees that filter offerings before they’re allocated on the investment committee. They’re not just singling out crypto,"" he said.      “We’re at the nascent beginning of this interest. Bitcoin is an asset that is here to stay, and now it's got to get in sync with what institutions want before they buy.""      Elon Musk recently announced that Tesla has rescinded the option to purchase electric vehicles with bitcoin due to sustainability concerns, another example of how bitcoin's environmental impact has been rising up the issue agenda of late.    Read more: Crypto Long & Short: Why Tesla’s Reversal Is Good for Bitcoin    O’Leary is interested in “tagging,” or wrapping bitcoin that has been mined sustainably, and called upon miners to approach institutions with a plan.      While the idea sounds like a win-win, the use of mining pools and the essential fungibility of BTC has drawn skepticism from miners and prominent members of the industry. Nic Carter has called so-called “clean bitcoin” a chimera: something more imaginary than real.      Still, O’Leary, a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist, is eyeing opportunities to support firms that can offer resources and structure for green mining. Greener practices, he says, will help stoke demand and drive up asset prices.      “That is what institutions want, and when that dam gets released the amount of capital that will come into bitcoin… it’ll be the reason it goes to a hundred thousand, two hundred thousand.”      “Everybody that owns bitcoin today, regardless of how it was mined, is incentivized to solve this problem for one reason alone, price appreciation.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MINING | TRADING,Cyrus Rothwell-Ferraris,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/24/kevin-oleary-doubles-down-on-green-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0909e6e9548f873d5b0c97f8930faf5bfe6c934e-1200x805.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Yearn.Finance (YFI) trading around $50,951 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Jumping 76% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,668 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).

Gaining 19% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $33,141-$39,801 (CoinDesk 20)  DeFi tokens explode    The decentralized finance, or DeFi, sector of the cryptocurrency market is making major performance jumps Monday. The token of lending protocol Yearn.Finance is up over 76% as of press time. In addition, UNI, the token of the leading decentralized exchange by volume, Uniswap, has climbed 54% as of press time.      According to charting software TradingView, so far in 2021 both yearn and uniswap have made triple digit percentage gains, but volatility in the market has actually sapped some of their juicy returns. For example, in early May Uniswap was up over 700% before a precipitous fall, then rebounded with Monday’s bull crypto market.      “DeFi tokens, like most altcoins, are lower market capitalized, possess lower liquidity and thus have higher volatility,” said Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital. “This past week saw a sharp decline, with these types of assets being hit harder than blue-chip crypto, such as bitcoin and ether. But as things seem to be rebounding the lower liquidity leads to a faster bid up on price.”    DEX volumes at record in May    The trading volume numbers for Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges are hitting record highs in May, with the total trading tally well over $100 billion, according to data aggregator Dune Analytics. Leading the way is bellwether Uniswap with a whopping $61 billion in volume this month.      Juicy opportunities in the crypto market this month have led to recording trading volumes on centralized exchanges as well, with the highest amount of bitcoin changing hands on those venues just last week. Large-scale capital inflows continue unabated and if anything, are now able to benefit from these slightly softer spot prices before all the weak hands are shaken out and we solidify a floor for this volatility.      John Willock, CEO of crypto custody provider Tritum, says lots of new entrants during this bull cycle flooding into the market is what’s causing record volume numbers across the board.      “Large-scale capital inflows continue unabated and if anything, are now able to benefit from these slightly softer spot prices before all the weak hands are shaken out and we solidify a floor for this volatility,” Willock told CoinDesk.    Ether volatility rising    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,668 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), gaining 34% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is well above the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bullish signal for market technicians.      While bitcoin’s 30-day volatility continues to increase, up to over 88% as of closing data from Sunday, ether is showing even greater choppiness. With an over-150% 30-day volatility metric, it is ether where traders are looking to generate big-time returns from its up-and-down nature as of late.      “We've had a few bumps in the road over the last few days and corrections are healthy,” said Tritum’s Willock. “Most of the recent volatility can be attributed to overextended leveraged speculators who got liquidated and caused a cascading trigger of drops for a lot of other participants who were on margin in some capacity, be it futures or spot markets.”      Read More: Ray Dalio: ‘I Have Some Bitcoin’    Bitcoin jumps, leverage cost levels off    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday by 19% as of press time. BTC was high above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bullish signal for market technicians.      BTC gained from $33,141 24 hours ago to $38,669 by 12:45 UTC (8:45 AM ET), a 16.6% increase during that time based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin slipped, then rebounded to $39,801 as of press time.      While crypto has gone mega-bullish Monday, the funding rates to leverage up in the bitcoin market, known as perpetual swaps, are still near zero. This suggests the recent spot market pop has not been the result of traders borrowing crypto to leverage up long – yet.      “The market recently crashed in a ‘W’ type shape with the first leg going as low as $30,000,” said Elie Le Rest, an executive at crypto quantitative firm ExoAlpha. “This ‘W’ bottom allowed the market to bounce back with a de-leveraged state to build more sustainable growth.”      Read More: Bitcoin, Ether Bounce After Disastrous Week for Crypto Market    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Monday.

The news takes on added significance as it was Musk's comments on May 13 regarding bitcoin's environmental impact that started a dramatic sell-off in the crypto market that gathered force last week and continued through this past weekend with bitcoin dropping to just above $31,000 Sunday.  Monday's quick recovery came as demand from wealthy investors appears to have brought relief to the battered cryptocurrencies, as CoinDesk reported earlier.  Adding support to bitcoin's price Monday was Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, who said he owns some bitcoin. He mentioned that during an interview recorded on May 6 and broadcast during the first day of CoinDesk's Consensus 2021 conference.  The oldest cryptocurrency by market value extended its gains Monday afternoon after Musk tweeted about bitcoin mining's ""promising"" renewable usage.

42434422,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCuhh,1621888046,Marty Bent: Bitcoiners Must Fight for Energy Narrative,"“There's no energy problem. Bitcoin is the energy solution,” said Marty Bent, co-founder of Great American Mining and host of ""Tales from the Crypt"" podcast, to end the panel on “Reframing Bitcoin's Energy: ESG, Time Preference and Public Perception” at Consensus 2021.      Moderated by Zack Voell, research and content director at Compass Mining, the discussion revolved around the role of carbon credits and the responsibility of bitcoin miners to lead the way in energy innovation.      Bent slammed the “energy hysterics” who criticize bitcoin’s energy consumption while ignoring similar or greater problems with favored industries such as wind turbine construction.      Both Bent and Ethan Vera, CFO of mining pool Luxor, were critical of the practice of buying carbon credits as a way to “green” the bitcoin mining industry.      “Miners are being forced in many cases to change their renewable energy source by carbon offsets to position themselves a certain way. Crafting narratives is taking up a lot of mindshare from executives that otherwise would be focused on building out more and better businesses,” said Vera.    Read more: Everything We Want Costs Energy, Including Bitcoin    “ESG is a complete accounting scam that gives subsidies and carbon credits to companies that just masquerade,” Bent said, referring to environmental, social and governance criteria. Meanwhile, bitcoin is “getting picked on.”      “People don't care about energy consumption,” said Bent. “They care about control.”      In the end, however, Vera took a more relaxed view. Bitcoin mining has ""seized the spotlight again and suddenly we’re getting targeted. Time will pass it onto something else. We just need to wait this out.”    'With great power comes great responsibility'    Tad Piper, CFO of Compute North, stepped even further away from Bent’s adversarial position. He pointed out that bitcoin miners have an opportunity and even a responsibility to support the transition to a cleaner grid. “With great power comes great responsibility.”      “I’m not sure I agree [about] the invisible hand of the man taking over the financial world,” he added.      As he broke it down, there are simply different ways to sustain the power grid during the energy transition. Rather than investing billions in battery banks as California is doing, trying to transition towards variable demand could be a better solution for a stable energy grid. Data centers like the Bitcoin network, which can be switched on and off as required, could provide that variability.      But Piper went on the attack when it came to Elon Musk. He speculated that the Tesla CEO’s recent change of tack on bitcoin mining's energy use might mean he has realized that data centers can compete with his main business – batteries – as a solution to the power grid’s impending problems.    What really matters is going out and building free market-based businesses to solve these problems in real life.    The high energy consumption of bitcoin mining has attracted increasing media attention recently. Last week, Greenpeace announced it would stop taking donations in bitcoin because of its energy use and particularly its fossil fuel use. Earlier this month, Musk said Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin payments, for the same reason.      CoinDesk published an opinion piece last month on the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, titled ""Does Bitcoin Have an Energy Problem?"" The author, George Kaloudis, points out that around 40% of energy used in bitcoin mining comes from renewable sources, roughly double their share of global energy use.

42434407,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCuJh,1621884404,Why Selling a Tesla for Bitcoin Makes Even Less Sense Now,"Up until now, businesses that accept bitcoin payments have had a free ride compared to businesses that accept cash. If Tesla sold a car and the customer paid with bitcoin, Tesla didn't have to fill in any special government forms. But an auto dealer who sold a car for cash had to notify the government.      That's about to change. As part of its American Families Plan, the Biden administration just announced that any business that accepts cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services will have to report purchases over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    This obligation has been required for cash transactions going back to the 1980s. For instance, if a real estate broker sells a property for over $10,000 and the buyer pays in cash, the broker has to submit a Form 8300 to the government. The form includes the buyer's name, address, taxpayer ID number and other details.      The Form 8300 requirement applies to car dealers, jewelry stores, boat dealers, pawn brokers and any other cash-intensive business.      The information gleaned from these Form 8300s gets collected in a database by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S.' anti-money laundering authority, and used along with currency transaction report (CTR) and suspicious activity report (SARs) to help catch money launderers. And because the form includes a taxpayer ID number, the IRS can cross-reference it against a taxpayer's stated income to catch tax evaders.      We don't know yet if bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions will be subject to the exact same Form 8300 reporting as cash. But it's likely that the Biden plan envisions something along those lines.    Read more: David Z. Morris: Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn’t Need a Savior    I suspect Tesla's recent foray into accepting cryptocurrency may have helped spur the Biden administration’s $10,000 reporting requirement. Recall that on March 24 Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter Tesla would allow customers to buy cars with bitcoin. (This offer has since been rescinded.)      If you work through the implications of businesses accepting large bitcoin payments, you can see why the government might have been concerned by Tesla’s move.      Regular law-abiding folks were never going to buy their Tesla with bitcoin. The company's punitive return policy for cars bought with bitcoin ensured that. Compounding matters is the fear factor involved in making non-reversible bitcoin payments. Bank-mediated payment methods are a lot friendlier. Most importantly, bitcoiners hold bitcoin because they are expecting to get rich. Offloading bitcoins to buy a Tesla means not becoming a millionaire.      If there was one group of buyers who may have flocked to buy Teslas with bitcoin it was people willing to put up with all these inconveniences. Motivated folks, like money launderers and tax evaders.      Would-be money launderers have strong motives for using businesses that accept bitcoin as a ""money mules.'' The IRS has become more active about gathering personal trading data from cryptocurrency exchanges. And so bitcoin owners with large gains and a preference for avoiding taxes must find lightly-surveilled off-ramps to liquidate their holdings.    If you work through the implications of businesses accepting large bitcoin payments, you can see why the government might have been concerned by Tesla’s move.    At the same time, anti-money laundering (AML) measures at cryptocurrency exchanges are improving, which means it is getting tougher for anyone who earned their bitcoin illicitly to launder them that way.      Tesla's decision to accept bitcoin may have made it the target of these high-risk clients. To convert illicit bitcoin into legitimate dollars, buy 10 Teslas with bitcoin, accept delivery then resell the cars for dollars in a bank account. Voila, Tesla has unwittingly helped launder dirty money.      Money laundering doesn't scale well with small-ticket items, say buying pizzas or T-shirts. But cars are a particularly convenient way to launder money. Reselling 10 new Teslas is much easier than selling 50,000 T-shirts.      In its now-deleted bitcoin policy, Tesla said it would be conducting due diligence on buyers. ""You authorize us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to verify your identity or protect you and/or us against fraud or other financial crime.""      But a would-be launderer may not have taken Tesla's threat very seriously. What does a car manufacturer know about setting up AML controls?      Tesla removed its bitcoin payments option last week. Elon Musk cited concern about ""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions."" (Incongruently, Musk hasn't sold Tesla's bitcoin investment.) But it's also possible that the risks of attracting every money launderer and tax evader in America led Tesla execs to advocate for closing down the bitcoin payments window.      Of course, I'm just speculating about their motivations. But the key point remains: Accepting large bitcoin payments can be risky for a company.    Read more: JP Koning: You’re a Lemon if You Buy a Tesla With Bitcoin    Back to the Biden administration's proposed $10,000 reporting requirement for purchases consummated with cryptocurrency. If it requires something like a Form 8300, it will add an extra layer of paperwork for companies like Tesla that want to accept bitcoin.      But it may also make bitcoin acceptance easier. If companies have balked up until now at the idea of accepting bitcoin payments (because of the risk of attracting shady customers), the $10,000 reporting requirement provides a government-sanctioned way of doing so. A company need only be sure to fill in an IRS form for each purchase and they'll be onside. So a Form 8300 requirement for cryptocurrency might make Tesla more willing to restart bitcoin payments, not less.      If more and more businesses decide to accept large cryptocurrency payments, will bitcoin finally become a popular medium of exchange?      Perhaps not. This gets us back to the original problem. Regular people were never going to buy Teslas with bitcoin, for the reasons listed above. And now with a proposed $10,000 cryptocurrency reporting requirement on the way, money launderers and tax evaders won't bother buying cars, either.      Unfortunately, that leaves no one willing to use bitcoin to buy Teslas.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/24/why-selling-a-tesla-for-bitcoin-makes-even-less-sense-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b2aea77acf20965ede3dea166025f43ef496bab-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kupor said in written testimony that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has “not provided clear regulatory guidelines for how tokens will be treated under existing regulatory rules.”      Kupor, whose own VC firm bets hundreds of millions of dollars on blockchain projects, argued during oral testimony that unclear securities guidelines have created a “very significant disparity” between the haves and the have-nots in the crypto capital markets.      Tokens exist in a gray zone in the U.S., he said. Some may be untouchable securities, others might not. Crypto venture firms pay their lawyers big time to know where they can place their bets.      Casual investors can’t afford to conduct securities research on every iffy token.      “For ordinary folks, without that clarity from the SEC it really does mean that they're missing out on what we believe is a really important growth opportunity,” he said.      Instead, U.S. regulators have focused on policing bad actors following the scam-ridden initial coin offering boom of 2017.      “While this is laudable, it has failed to provide clarity for the many determined good actors who seek to develop blockchain projects that are both successful and regulatorily compliant,” Kupor wrote. “This inability to differentiate between good faith technology entrepreneurs and get-rich-quick schemes makes the SEC’s job of policing this activity even harder.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/24/a16z-tells-congress-sec-disadvantages-ordinary-folks-from-token-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1be9a4217ac896f120e86372cc292d1ca4208ba5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434424,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCunh,1621881496,Rocky Mountain Institute Proposes Protocol to Track Climate Emissions,"The world must accelerate toward climate progress, which will require supply chain decarbonization. The message from the international community of policy makers and climate scientists is clear: More action is needed now and throughout this decade to limit global temperature rise to 1.5℃ this century.      That is the message from the International Energy Agency’s recent ""Net Zero by 2050"" report, as well as from the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In response to this, more companies are implementing science-based emission reduction plans.    Marc Johnson will discuss this piece as a guest on a special ESG-themed Consensus edition of CoinDesk TV's ""Money Reimagined"" show, 3 p.m. ET Monday, May 24. Register here.    Pairing policy measures with market-based mechanisms provides the recipe to supercharge climate alignment. To enable this transformation, climate-related information must be compiled into actionable metrics to drive demand signals for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction at all stages of production and distribution along supply chains.      In this article, we propose a new, digitally native system for supply chain accountability. This solution would include an open-source attribution protocol and digital schema that anyone can use to trace emissions across supply chain operations, providing actionable intelligence to cut emissions at scale.      This system would draw on the principles of a distributed ledger application architecture by providing the means to attribute the source and progress of supply chain operations and associated emissions, to independent stakeholders, according to a common protocol. By doing so, this solution could enable a higher level of verifiability, transparency and fault-tolerance.    Marc Johnson, a senior associate of the Climate Intelligence Program at RMI, is working with RMI and its partner, the Energy Web Foundation, to develop a digitally-native GHG Protocol. Paolo Natali is a principal with RMI’s Climate Intelligence program. David Mann is a senior fellow at RMI.    It is reasonable to expect that corporate GHG inventories will become a requirement in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) within this decade. When that occurs, there must be a robust data standard to represent those disclosures. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is soliciting ideas on this topic, but the SEC does not plan to develop a data standard for climate-related disclosures. Rather, it will adopt one once it is proven in the market.      According to the GHG Protocol, supply chain emissions, referred to as “scope 3” emissions, are often the largest contributor to corporate carbon footprints, yet they are regularly left unmapped or roughly estimated. This is primarily because they are not defined in a way that establishes unequivocal accountability, nor are they trackable.      The current GHG Protocol scope 3 guidance would benefit from updated accounting principles that clarify responsibility, and from a system that adequately tracks GHG emissions. As it is, relationships between emissions and players within a supply chain fade in complex, multi-tiered supply chains involving the global movement of intermediary goods and services.      To address these issues we need a system that generates robust metrics and verifiable data that represent the materiality of climate risks. To fully represent the materiality of climate risks, these metrics and data must account for the embodied emissions in products moving through supply chains.      We envision a digitally native system for supply chain accountability. This solution’s open-source attribution protocol would enable anyone to define, track and trace emissions, and to report disclosures. It would also allow anyone to trade physical goods and digital attributes and their associated credit certificates (e.g., carbon offsets and insets).      It is RMI’s view that such a standard can be developed as an evolution of the existing GHG Protocol, including by enabling supply chain emissions to be defined and verified via digital attributes in addition to calculation, estimation and self-disclosure. This would be compatible with a distributed ledger or blockchain application architecture, enabling a higher level of verifiability, transparency, and fault-tolerance.      Our model calls for ""digital twins"" that represent the product, with emissions attached at the point of generation (when it is an actor’s direct emissions, or what their operations emit as part of making their product). As the product flows through the supply chain, we track the digital twins in parallel, before being expressed ultimately as scope 3 in the carbon accounts of the other actors in the supply chain.      The foundation of this vision is the creation of an open-source digital architecture that defines how an attribute is created, its basic format, and how it is represented in the accounts of each player along the supply chain. The unit of trade for the GHG attribute of any given product is a standard amount of avoided, embodied CO2 equivalent, where the source of the data (e.g., modeled or measured), and any verification, is included.      By incorporating digital attributes into a comprehensive standard, practitioners will be able to verify robust GHG and ESG data, while democratizing the process by lowering the reliance on centralized data service providers. Central registries may still exist for sensitive data and for products based on GHG attributes – certificates, offsets, compliance markets, and so on – but the GHG attributes themselves would enjoy distributed exchange and verification.      One way to accomplish this vision is to develop a system built on a peer-to-peer network that dynamically depicts the progress of supply chain operations, attributing and tracking the associated emissions according to a common protocol. To increase the veracity of data inputs, documentation or validation should be linked to every associated event, enabling a process tracking system that collects and stores information in a transparent manner.      For this proposed system to fulfill its function, it must accomplish two important goals. First, the system should complement the current GHG Protocol scope 3 guidance. Second, the system should be open-source and architecturally decentralized, thus enabling free use, interoperability, and future modification.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET,"Marc Johnson, David Mann, Paolo Natali",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/24/rocky-mountain-institute-proposes-protocol-to-track-climate-emissions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d0faab8364270d175094f42e0396d43d502e4c8-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434420,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCufh,1621877651,IMF Official: ‘A World With More Than One Reserve Currency Is a More Stable World’,"“A world with more than one reserve currency is a more stable world,” Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli, a division chief for the International Monetary Fund, said Monday.      Mancini was responding to a question from CoinDesk Managing Director Emily Parker during CoinDesk TV’s coverage of Consensus 2021, the company’s annual conference that brings together experts and influencers in cryptocurrency, global finance and more. Parker had asked whether the U.S. should be concerned that China's under-development central bank digital currency (CBDC) could threaten the dominance of the U.S. dollar as the world’s global reserve currency.      “I'm not saying this is the case for the U.S. dollar,” explained Mancini, whose full title is division chief of IMF monetary and capital markets payments and infrastructure team. “This is a theoretical argument that underpins the greater stability of the world with multiple reserve currencies. So I think from an international perspective, that there'll be more than one is a welcomed proposition,” Mancini said. He added that the world already has multiple reserve currencies including the dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen.      In March, Agustín Carsten, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said China would not get a “first-mover advantage” over the U.S. by issuing a CBDC. A month later, Jerome Powell, head of the U.S. Federal Reserve, said China’s rush to develop its digital yuan will not push the U.S. into a digital currency race. Meanwhile, China has been quietly testing a digital yuan.      Mancini’s own statement comes after the IMF published a report last year that said CBDCs could benefit countries looking to exert more control over their monetary policy, but they are not a solution for every crisis.    Currency substitution    Mancini also said crypto assets are still too small to be a significant source of financial stability risks.      “For crypto assets to be a significant risk to central banks, there needs to be a considerable amount of currency substitution,” Mancini said, which in this context means countries would have to use a (theoretically) more stable cryptocurrency instead or in addition to the local currency.      Mancini added that currency substitution is a big concern internationally, not just with crypto assets but also with stablecoins and CBDCs because countries with weaker institutions, high inflation and volatile exchange rates have an increasing degree of currency substitution.      “These are exactly the types of issues that need to be tackled through international cooperation,” Mancini said.    Not even close, dogecoin…    Although cryptocurrencies can usually be created over a short period of time, that doesn’t necessarily make them good candidates as global reserve currencies, Mancini said.      CoinDesk Managing Editor of Global Capital Markets Lawrence Lewitinn asked him if it would make sense for the institution to issue its own digital currency that can act as a global reserve currency. When Mancini responded that global reserve currencies cannot be created overnight, Lewitinn argued that currencies like bitcoin and even the euro were created relatively quickly, and that the IMF – a neutral institution – should be able to create one should it have such a mandate.      Lewitinn added that the rise of dogecoin over the past few years happened fairly quickly, and showed that it's not impossible.      “I just wanted to take the opportunity to clarify that bitcoin and dogecoin and other such coins, while they may have been created at the snap of a finger and relatively quickly, and might have reached widespread adoption and substantial market capitalization relatively quickly, they do not serve the purpose of an international reserve currency. Nor can they be perceived as such,” Mancini said.      Mancini added that a global reserve currency must be a stable store of value and digital assets are much too volatile and are closer to investment assets than money.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | DOGE | FIAT | MARKET,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/24/imf-official-a-world-with-more-than-one-reserve-currency-is-a-more-stable-world,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4891f35caf15e723a92d301bc6f27f063b021ed2-1420x919.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434416,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCuXh,1621876002,"Goldman Sachs Report Projects Coinbase Stock Will Climb to $306, Looks to DeFi and Beyond","Goldman Sachs analysts presented the bull case for Coinbase Monday with a sweeping report that highlighted upsides across the nascent crypto economy.      Calling Coinbase’s newly listed COIN stock the “best way to gain exposure to the expansion of the crypto-native ecosystem,” the 54-page report provides analysis of decentralized finance (DeFi), competing centralized exchanges and brief overview of everything from dogecoin (DOGE) to monero (XMR) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      The “Buy” rating and $306 price target for COIN comes as Goldman Sachs ramps up its crypto trading desk with bitcoin futures and other products. However, the report suggests that at least Goldman’s research unit is apprising some of the more exotic corners of the crypto market.      “The development of DeFi applications is still in its infancy, and relative to the nearly ~$2+ trillion market cap for crypto currencies, the total value of crypto on DeFi applications is still relatively low at just ~$67bn,” Goldman Sachs’ Will Nance and Onkar Gandhi wrote, adding:    “That being said, we believe they represent important proofs of concept for more complex applications in the future. One of the most important features of many of these protocols, in our view, is that many DeFi applications have native “governance tokens” (for example, UNI for Uniswap, COMP for Compound) that allow the holders of the token to vote on changes to the protocol’s operations.”    Though DeFi is seen as a competitor to centralized entities like Coinbase, the analysts said its growth has considerable potential to expand the crypto economy, and Coinbase’s business with it.      “Should this occur, though this is not part of our forecast, we believe that the ecosystem has the potential over time to drive meaningful amounts of activity and commerce,” Nance and Gandhi said.      Crypto as whole, they said, has the potential to “expand the market size of financial activities in the traditional financial industry.”    COIN’s position    Goldman analysts said retail trading transaction revenue is likely to dominate Coinbase’s near-term profits. They projected the company controls as much as 30% market share among fiat-driven exchanges.      The cash flow could shift if Coinbase’s fee model, already facing pressure from competitor exchanges, is forced to adopt lower pricing. Crypto market volatility would be good for business: more users tend to trade higher volumes during swings, meaning more fees, meaning more transaction revenue.      Coinbase’s world-leading custody business is a “cornerstone” product well-positioned to capture a steady flow of institutional newcomers. And staking revenue could boom with more chains swapping their consensus mechanism and Coinbase taking a 25% cut. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake “could be a significant driver of staking revenue going forward.”      Other potential growth areas: payments, non-fungible tokens and lending products. There’s “significant white space” for new products, the analysts said.

With COIN down 33% since its April listing, Goldman Sachs hedged its bullishness by illustrating how regulatory headwinds could slash token prices. Lower levels of crypto volatility could also negatively hit COIN’s revenue, the analysts said.      They gave COIN 36% upside as the best “blue-chip” vehicle for chasing the crypto economy.

Caitlin Long, the main catalyst for Wyoming’s favorable crypto regulations, commented on Twitter that despite working with him closely, she hadn’t known Gordon was a hodler.      Gordon said the Cowboy State’s $60 billion broadband expansion program and regulatory groundwork are helping to attract blockchain-focused startups including Kraken, Ripple Labs and IOHK, the company behind Cardano.      He said the state will continue to “push to make sure that entrepreneurs have a fertile ground on which to build these new types of structures.""      “People often look to New York or Miami or Delaware before they look at Wyoming,” he said. “But a lot of the pioneering work has been done here.”      Gordon described the state’s government as “nimble,” with a communicative legislature that first introduced accommodating bills in 2018 to clarify the synergy between banking and blockchain.      IOHK chose the University of Wyoming for its Cardano lab over Harvard and MIT, and Kraken Financial earned special purpose depository institution (SPDI) status in Wyoming in September to become the first cryptocurrency “bank charter” in the country. More recently, Ripple Labs has set up shop in the state, and Bill 38, signed by Gordon last month, will allow decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to be recognized by Wyoming as LLCs.      As a governor known for its small-government principles, Gordon was keen to champion private digital currencies over state-issued ones.      ""I have grave concerns about the e-yuan and other government coins suddenly overwhelming the system. If you can have bitcoin and you can stake with that, that ultimately makes our economy stronger,"" he said.      And he’s keenly aware that other jurisdictions are looking to catch Wyoming in the race for “friendliest” place for crypto development.      “I know [Colorado] Governor [Jared] Polis has talked about catching up,” he said. “If you look at Wyoming, we are still going up.

Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus 2021, Le, who oversees MicroStrategy's trove of 92,079 BTC, said the imperative holds especially true for any company offering a bitcoin product: ""To do so credibly, you have to go all in, you have to put bitcoin on your balance sheet.""      MicroStrategy has gone all in. The business intelligence company has purchased $2.251 billion in bitcoin since August, becoming the cryptocurrency’s largest publicly traded holder.      Given bitcoin’s recent volatility, the remarks could strike mainstream CFOs as odd. The “store of value” has dropped 42% from all-time highs in April. (Zoom out the lens, however, and bitcoin has appreciated mightily since its inception more than a decade ago.)      Le said corporations don't need to mirror MicroStrategy's hyper bullishness.      ""I'm not saying you should put all of your corporate treasury in bitcoin,"" he said. ""But if you're not putting any of it into bitcoin, I don't think you're doing your fiduciary responsibility, which is maximizing shareholder value.""

42434418,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCubh,1621872000,Senator Lummis’ Financial Innovation Caucus to Launch Tuesday,"The U.S. needs a more coordinated regulatory strategy around financial innovation, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said.      The first-term, bitcoin-friendly federal lawmaker took the virtual stage Monday at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 in a pre-recorded interview with CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors to advocate for a more unified regulatory framework around digital assets that encourages innovation.      “The details of this are too important to get wrong, but it’s going to be a big lift for all of us,” Lummis said.      To that end, the senator’s Financial Innovation Caucus, which she founded with Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), will formally launch tomorrow, she said. The caucus intends to study payments, settlement, consumer protection, digital currencies and other issues.      “We have to do a great deal more in the coming years to clarify and modernize these rules,” she said, adding:      “Now we need clear rules.”      Part of the U.S.’ efforts to bolster digital asset regulation must include its effort around a digital dollar, Lummis said.      The senator said a central bank digital currency or a stablecoin would be needed to help the country compete with China’s digital yuan.      “They're thinking of rolling out additional uses for it at the 2022 Winter Olympics,” she said. “We want to make sure that we continue to be strong in innovation in the digital asset space.”    Wyoming rules    In response to a question from Demirors about what benefits Wyoming’s relatively new special purpose depository institution charter and other crypto-friendly regulations have brought to the state, Lummis said new crypto startups can take advantage of the business-friendly environment in the state.      “Our bank regulators have a regulatory manual that really provides a solid foundation, addressing consumer protection and safety, addressing the rules of the road for the charters that have been issued,” she said.      The Federal Reserve recently issued a proposal to allow certain chartered institutions access to its master accounts, which could include Wyoming-chartered SPDIs. If the proposal is finalized and implemented, it would bring the Wyoming institutions – which currently include Kraken and Avanti – one step closer to becoming full-service banks to the crypto sector.      Bitcoin mining is also aiding Wyoming by being used for stranded energy sources, Lummis claimed. In Wyoming, mining rig operators are hooking stranded natural gas up to bitcoin miners, redirecting fossil fuels that otherwise would have been vented into the atmosphere, she said.      “I'd like to point out that about 12% of energy comes from renewables. But in the case of mining for bitcoin, it's about 40% renewables. So this industry is ahead of the game in terms of using renewable energy,” she said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/24/senator-lummis-financial-innovation-caucus-to-launch-tuesday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/37e953537311e72b1e8e69782c0be20df162aa0c-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42434426,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCurh,1621871812,"The Next Mickey Mouse or Hello Kitty Could Be an NFT, Says Gary Vaynerchuk","For the longest time, people have built collections on shared interests. Collecting magnets, trading cards or exchanging banter over sports have all served as social currency. But could non-fungible tokens (NFTs) do the same for digital items?      Media mogul Gary Vaynerchuk says yes.      The chairman of VaynerX and CEO of VaynerMedia, Vaynerchuk said that while the current state of affairs surrounding NFTs reminds him of the hype associated with internet stocks in the early 2000s, it’s quite likely that in the near future the unique digital tokens will become the driving force for social currency.      ""This is going to be the greatest era of intellectual property ownership,"" he said Monday, in an impassioned conversation at Consensus 2021. “This will be bigger revenue [for sports teams] than TV rights.""      Although sports stars have long benefitted from lucrative sponsorship deals, once they realize the sway they hold over a “multi-billion dollar” market it would change the game substantially, including the possibility of collectibles having a tied-in royalty component for the issuers, Vaynerchuk said.      While it's likely “a lot of things will not end up being worth what they are today,” the intellectual property implications go much further, Vaynerchuk said. IP will likely be NFT-native and then built up to include add-ons like concert access or even entry to popular restaurants, he predicted.      Just as “Pokemon used a card game, 'Star Wars' used movies and Harry Potter used books” to build out other forms of IP, an NFT could serve as the kernel for multiple lucrative ventures, Vaynerchuk said. “The original Mickey Mouse drawing is a collectible asset,” and an NFT could play a similar foundational role in future media empires.      “The real crazy opportunity is building a Power Rangers, Pokemons or Transformers” for the digital world, he said.      NFT art and collectibles have shot to fame this year with the most notable sale coming in a March auction at Christie’s, which sold a work by Mike Winkelmann – popularly known as Beeple – for $69 million. The unique digital tokens have also become a hot product in the fantasy sports space with Dapper Labs’ TopShot platform registering $575 million in sales volume as of late March, and raking in investment from basketball legend Michael Jordon, players such as Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, and actors Will Smith and Ashton Kutcher, among others.      In February, Vaynerchuk participated in a $50 million funding round for Sorare, an NFT-powered fantasy soccer and collectibles platform. In the Monday chat, he revealed that his $25,000 investment in Sorare is smaller than his NFT holdings but said he sincerely feels sports are a major expansion opportunity for issuers of digital tokens to capitalize on an additional revenue stream.      Noting that NFTs, much like cryptocurrency and Tesla stock, represent an alternative investment class, Vaynerchuk said those looking to make monetary gains on digital collectibles will be searching for needles in a big haystack since the market is flooded with supply.      “The cat’s out of the bag,” Vaynerchuk said, adding that while not all NFT projects may survive the hype cycle when the token economy grows to a size substantial enough that the hottest restaurant on New York City’s Upper West Side starts minting tokens, “the 58-year-old on the Upper West Side will buy the NFT.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/24/the-next-mickey-mouse-or-hello-kitty-could-be-an-nft-says-gary-vaynerchuk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e90c5f2819c0630a0c78b03fd3ba92b2e09dadf2-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In recent months we’ve started staking our own Ethereum 2.0 validator and we’ve launched $DESK, our own ERC-20 token.      Now, during Consensus 2021, our biggest event of the year, we’re pushing into virtual reality.      We’re debuting “Long the Metaverse,” a VR exhibition featuring dozens of crypto artists at the heart of this financial movement, in collaboration with producer Godfrey Meyer and curators Annissa, Justin and Decryptolorian of the $WHALE community.      The exhibition, hosted on Mozilla’s Hubs browser-based virtual platform, features 25 artists, accompanied by live-streamed interviews from CoinDesk’s studio. Every day during Consensus, we’ll host 30-minute roundtable talks in the metaverse, or virtual world, accessible via PC browser or VR headset, to discuss the artworks and the world of non-fungible tokens (NFT).      See also: Introducing $DESK, CoinDesk’s New Rewards Program    Long on the metaverse    The metaverse is a concept coined by the sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel ""Snow Crash."" It is a persistent virtual environment combining physical and augmented reality. Think Second Life, but vastly expanded and housed on a blockchain.      The gallery of NFT artwork will stay open for the next month, but this permanent virtual space is designed to live on well beyond the conference itself.      NFTs, which reached the mainstream this year, are building blocks in our understanding of how digital and real identities converge. We see the metaverse, meanwhile, as a further extension of the crypto ecosystem.      We’ve already seen how virtual worlds like Decentraland have opened up real jobs at virtual casinos, regardless of geographic location. These new virtual opportunities come at a time when physical jurisdictions are competing like never before to attract talent.      Read more: This Casino in Decentraland Is Hiring (for Real)      If the internet made the world flat, the metaverse will make us multiversal.      It’s a dimension yet to be fully explored, but we hope to continue pushing the needle, and this exhibition is our start as we integrate virtual reality as a staple of Consensus experiences for years to come.    How to access the metaverse    Curator and host Godfrey Meyer, or Boomboxhead, will interview the crypto artists from the exhibition. The roundtable chats will all be viewable in the metaverse, and Meyer will livestream the Monday and Thursday sessions on his Twitter page.      There are three NFT virtual environments – Room 1, Room 2 and Room 3 – where up to 24 users at a time can join and interact with each other via avatars. If those fill up, users can also create a private room - and have the gallery to themselves.      The galleries can be accessed by PC browser or VR headset.

42434410,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCuNh,1621868410,Augur Adds Sports Betting With Launch of Polygon-Based 'Augur Turbo',"Decentralized prediction market Augur is setting its sights on a new field – sports betting.      Announced Monday, the six-year-old project is announcing the launch of Augur Turbo. Notably, the new sportsbook will live on Ethereum layer 2 Polygon, drastically cutting down on fees on the platform, which at times exceeded the winnings for users.      Prediction markets rely on the idea of the “wisdom of the crowd” or the idea that a collective group of people will have a more accurate assessment of a market than any lone expert. Key to that idea, however, is you have to attract a crowd. With the Polygon scaling solution, that concept could become more viable.      Augur Turbo will rely on Chainlink’s oracle network, or a way to feed external data into programmable smart contracts. With the Chainlink integration, users can create betting markets for the National BasketBall Association, Major League Baseball, Mixed Martial Arts and the Olympics. Support for the National Football League, college football, soccer, tennis, golf and esports will soon follow. Chainlink will deliver data such as schedules, post-game scores, team and player stats.      Augur Turbo’s prediction markets will rely on Chainlink data to settle bets immediately after a market closes.      The move to Polygon highlights Augur’s desire to capture more users. Fellow prediction market Polymarket built on Polygon (then known as Matic) last fall and found success in serving crypto-savvy election watchers.

Sports betting surging    Traditional sports books not only siphon off fees, they also limit what markets can be set.      Sports betting remains a lucrative market. Since the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 in 2018, which effectively banned sports betting, more than $20 billion has been bet.      Beyond its sports betting project, version two of Augur will continue to exist on layer 1 as Augur Pro.

42415764,WkWFu5l5TZXnF1B32UXNpt,1621866068,Asset Manager One River Files for Carbon-Neutral Bitcoin ETF in US,"One River Digital Asset Management has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would be carbon neutral.  According to the S-1 filing, submitted on Monday, the One River Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and would buy and dispose of carbon credits to account for the emissions associated with the bitcoin in the fund.  To that end, One River says it has inked a deal with a Uruguay-based firm doing business as Moss Earth to purchase blockchain tokens representing certified reductions in carbon emissions.  Each of the MCO2 tokens is aimed to represent a claim on a certified carbon credit held in a pool of carbon credits held by Moss Earth on a registry with Verra.  No ticker has been announced for the ETF so far, which has been registered as a Delaware statutory trust since April 27.  The trust will not purchase or sell bitcoin directly, per the filing, and instead, will use third parties to provide the digital assets through “in-kind” transactions via the selling and redeeming of shares.  Coinbase Custody has partnered as the custodian for the ETF's bitcoin assets.  Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton is an adviser at One River, having joined the firm's Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council in March 2021.  The proposed bitcoin ETF – which looks aimed to appease investors' anxiety about the carbon emissions associated with bitcoin mining – joins a deep bench of ETF proposals before the SEC, including one from VanEck.

42434423,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCuph,1621863773,"As Bitcoin Gyrates Wildly, Some Traders Start to Bet on Things Calming Down","Bitcoin's implied volatility – traders' expectation for price turbulence as reflected in the cryptocurrency options market – has spiked well above record levels in the wake of the latest crash.      The cryptocurrency's implied month-ahead price volatility doubled from early-May levels to an annualized 150% last week, according to data source Skew. As of press time, the gauge had faded somewhat to an annualized 123%, still well above the historical average of about 75% and also above the 113% volatility actually witnessed in the market over the past month.      Some traders are now taking advantage of the situation by selling options, mainly puts. These put writers, essentially sellers of bearish price insurance, might be betting that the worst of the latest correction has passed. The implication is that the implied volatility will cool in the coming days, making options cheaper. If they're right, the options sellers could prove to have superb timing.      Asian family offices and ultra-high-net-worth individuals ""are starting to fade this move using options (selling puts) given the favorable skew/high implied volatility, as a way to scale in,"" Amber Group, a crypto services provider, said in a tweet thread early Monday.      Implied volatility has a positive impact on options price and typically tends to revert toward its longer-term average. Hence, seasoned traders tend to sell options when they think the spread between the implied volatility and historical averages looks high. The same traders often look to buy options when volatility is relatively low.      Put options are currently drawing higher prices than call options, which is seen as a type of bullish bet for options buyers. The dynamic is evident from the positive one-week, one- and three-month put-call ""skews,"" which measure the cost of puts relative to call options. The six-month skew in the bitcoin options market is currently hovering around zero, signifying a long-term neutral bias in the options market.      Data from exchanges shows there is a clear preference for selling puts at the current elevated level of implied volatility. Short put trades account for 29% of total flows seen today, while call sells (selling insurance against price rally) account for 24%.      However, the elevated volatility level isn't stopping investors from buying calls, a sign of bullishness building in the market. Long puts account for only 14% (half of the short put trades), and call buys 28%.    Bitcoin options writing is a risky business    Selling or writing options is akin to selling a lottery ticket or an insurance policy, where losses can be significant while profit is limited to the extent of the premium received. Premium is the compensation paid by the option (insurance) buyer to the insurance seller.      And, of course, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can be highly volatile and unpredictable; it's entirely possible bitcoin prices have further to fall. So while selling put options looks attractive based on the pricing, it's a risky business, and probably best reserved for investors and traders who can afford to take the loss.      In the past 24 hours, exchanges have seen significant selling in put options at the $32,000, $30,000, and $28,000 strike prices, based on data provided by Swiss-based crypto derivatives tracking platform Laevitas. That suggests more traders think they're getting compensated smartly to offer protection at those levels.      Also read: CME Returns to Second Place in Latest Rankings of Bitcoin Futures Exchanges      If bitcoin continues to recover the lost ground, these put options will lose value, giving traders paper profits.

Announced Monday, Solidus’ $20 million Series A was led by Evolution Equity Partners and included Hanaco Ventures, which led the startup’s $3.75 million seed round in early 2019.      The Solidus Series A attracted heavy hitters from the crypto trading space like FTX and Fidelity Investments-affiliated VC Avon Ventures. Notably, former regulators also joined the round: Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alums Chris Giancarlo and Daniel Gorfine and former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Troy Paredes.      Keeping tabs on whether traders “paint the tape” is particularly tough across crypto’s fragmented legion of trading venues. But it’s crucial to help U.S. regulators give the green light to a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF).

So why is it so different with digital assets?”      A deep dive later, the team found that crypto’s market structure led to a particular set of manipulation topologies such as spoofing, pump and dumps, layering and wash trading.

42434414,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCuVh,1621862400,Ray Dalio: ‘I Have Some Bitcoin’,"Concerns about a looming global debt crisis have taken the world’s top hedge fund manager from doubting bitcoin (BTC) to dabbling in it.      Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said the U.S. dollar is on the verge of devaluation on a level last seen in 1971 and that China is threatening the greenback’s role as the world's reserve currency. In such an environment bitcoin, with its gold-like properties, looks increasingly attractive as a savings vehicle, said Dalio, whose firm started 2021 with $101.9 billion in assets under management, making it the world’s largest hedge fund.      “Personally, I’d rather have bitcoin than a bond” in an inflationary scenario, Dalio said during an hour-long conversation with CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael J. Casey.      Now, his interest is more than hypothetical or academic.      “I have some bitcoin,” Dalio volunteered in the middle of the interview, recorded on May 6 and to be broadcast Monday during Consensus by CoinDesk 2021.      Dalio joins fellow billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller in not only expressing pessimism about the dollar but taking a position in bitcoin. Broadly, the traditional finance world has gone from ignoring or shunning to tentatively embracing cryptocurrencies, some looking to profit from their day-to-day volatility, others seeking a haven from inflation as governments swelled money supplies during the coronavirus pandemic.      Bridgewater’s chief financial officer, John Dalby, recently left the storied firm to join NYDIG, the bitcoin custodian and prime brokerage that facilitated insurance giant MassMutual’s $100 million crypto buy.      After expressing skepticism about the cryptocurrency as recently as November, Dalio began to show a change of heart this year. “There exists the possibility that bitcoin and its competitors can fill that growing need” for an alternative store of value, he wrote in January.      Dalio’s off-the-cuff remark to CoinDesk about owning “some” BTC represents the closest thing to an endorsement from him to date. Nonetheless, in the same conversation, he reiterated his concern that governments, fearing competition from bitcoin to state monetary systems, could crack down on its owners.      “Bitcoin’s greatest risk is its success,” Dalio cautioned.    The debt cycle    More than a decade ago, on the heels of the 2008 financial crisis (and during the nascent stages of Bitcoin), Dalio began studying the rise and fall of the three most recent global reserve currencies: the Dutch guilder, the British pound, and the U.S. dollar, he recounted.      As Dalio sees it, currency supremacy moves in three “cycles” that may occur simultaneously: the creation of debt and financial assets; an “internal cohesiveness clash cycle” (“as the wealth gaps grow and the value gaps grow – and political groups grow – you have a greater amount of conflict”); and the rise of another great power to challenge the existing top currency.      Whether a currency can withstand such cycles depends on the strength of the economy behind the global reserve currency.      The U.S. dollar is currently in the midst of the first cycle, where “debt and credit create buying power,” said Dalio, who is co-chairman and co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater.      Yet, these are short-term “stimulative” and long-term “depressants” because such things as government debts will eventually have to be paid back, he warned. Nonetheless, those debts are issued, but it gets increasingly difficult.      “All of those financial assets are claims on real stuff, real goods and services,” Dalio said. “And when the pile becomes very big, and the incentives for not holding that are no longer there, you have a problem.”      That happened to the U.S. once before, Dalio noted. After the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, global exchange rates were tied to the dollar which, in turn, was backed by gold. However, in the 1960s federal spending skyrocketed due to an expansion of entitlement programs at the same time the U.S. was boosting its defense spending to battle the Soviets in the Cold War as well as pay the escalating costs of the Vietnam War.      The higher debt eventually caused a depletion of America’s gold reserves from about 20 metric tons in the late 1950s to under 10 metric tons by 1970. Sensing the situation was no longer tenable, President Richard Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard in 1971. The dollar has been a “fiat” currency ever since.      The current situation now resembles 1971, Dalio warned.      “As you look at the budgets, and you look ahead, we know we're going to need a lot more money, a lot more debt,” he said.    “You need to borrow money? You have to print that. You need more money? So, taxes go up and that produces a dynamic. Now I can keep going on about what happens in that dynamic. It may be capital controls. … I painfully learned in 1971 that it causes stocks to go up. It causes… gold, bitcoin, real estate, everything to go up, because it's really going down in dollars. And that's the part of the cycle we’re in.”  Looming inflation    A major narrative surrounding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they serve as an inflation hedge, or at least will benefit from fiscal and monetary stimulus.      As governments around the world continue their attempts to stave off economic crises with more spending, much has been made about the prospects of inflation. In the 12 months ending April, the annualized inflation rate for the U.S. was 4.2%, well higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% long-term target, though a large part of that was because the rate is being compared to April 2020, a month where many of the world’s economies ground to a halt.      There are two types of inflation, Dalio said: one caused by supply and demand, where labor demand is high and capacity is low, forcing prices up; and monetary inflation due to a devaluation of the currency.      As money gets pumped into the economy, it intertwines the two inflation types.      “We will have a hell of a lot of demand because we put all that money in cash all over the place,” said Dalio. At the same time as the money supply has increased, yields have fallen to lows as investors snap up bonds and other assets such as real estate.      “It'll change the amount that is in the hands of individuals, and so on,” he said, “and that'll move on because cash is trash. I mean, I'd say that because it'll have that negative real return.”      It is that second, monetary type of inflation that will ultimately hold sway, according to Dalio. That could be good for assets such as real estate, stocks and cryptocurrencies, but only up to a point.      “As those prices rise – like a bond – their future expected returns go down,” he said. “As they come closer to the interest rate … then there's no longer the incentive to buy those things. And you could have trouble. It becomes very difficult to tighten monetary policy, because the whole thing falls apart. Everything's interest rate-sensitive.”      The central bank then has to resort to more money printing, he added, and that could eventually lead assets to have a negative real return despite nominal increases, as was seen in the 1970s.    China as capital competitor    Coming in to fill the vacuum of the dollar’s decline is China, which has done some fiscal stimulus and relatively muted monetary stimulus since the start of the pandemic.      The world’s most populous country is also being helped by loosening restrictions on foreign investment into the country, Dalio said.      “In 2015, only 2% of Chinese markets were open to foreigners. Now it's over 60% [but] if you look at the relative pricing, and so on, it's a whole different story because they're not doing quantitative easing,” he said. “They still have an attractive bond market. They have attractive capital markets that are more open. And as they're more open, big investors – institutional investors, central banks, and so on – view themselves as underweighted there,” meaning their holdings in China are insufficient, relative to the returns they can generate.    Read more: Ray Dalio, Wall Street’s ‘Oddest Duck,’ Shares the Bitcoin Mind    A capital market drawing in investments can translate into added strength to the Chinese renminbi.      “When you buy a Chinese financial asset, like buying an American financial asset, you have to buy their currency. So it's supportive to their currency and it's also supportive to their assets,” said Dalio. He said China gains the capacity to bill and lend in its currency when there are capital inflows. “China has been very reticent to do that [so as] not to disrupt the system. But you're seeing more of the internationalization of the renminbi. It has appeal for borrowers and lenders. … That dynamic is really following the same arc of monetary systems and empires pattern.”    Neutral reserve currency?    With one currency (the dollar) possibly on the wane while another (the renminbi) possibly ascendant, there is the chance a neutral cryptocurrency such as bitcoin could act as gold did in previous centuries.      While he suggested a diversified portfolio could include the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, there are risks many may not be considering, according to Dalio.      “One of the great things, I think, as a worry is the government having the capacity to control almost any of them, including bitcoin, or the digital currencies,” he said. “They know where they are, and they know what's going on.”      Governments may start to worry should bondholders sell their bonds in favor of bitcoin. “The more we create savings in [bitcoin], the more you might say, ‘I'd rather have bitcoin than the bond.’ Personally, I'd rather have bitcoin than a bond,” Dalio said, chuckling. “And then the more that happens, then it goes into bitcoin and it doesn't go into credit, then [governments] lose control of that.”      Such a situation could lead those governments to crack down on bitcoin holders.      One indicator, Dalio said, is the relative value of bitcoin versus gold. Excluding government reserves and jewelry uses, the value of gold is roughly $5 trillion, he estimated, about five times that of bitcoin. “It's about 80/20 right now in the world, so that's something I'd watch, too. But I think those things probably are going to rise relative to bonds.”      There is one scenario where rising debt can be overcome, and that’s through productivity. And while that’s harder to measure than before, it will hinge on technology, he said.      “The world is going to change at an incredibly fast pace,” Dalio said. “Whoever wins the technology race, wins it all, economically, and militarily. … That's what the next five years looks like.”",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Lawrence Lewitinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/24/ray-dalio-i-have-some-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8608297703a87f3571e11badf01b29386a72e63a-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434419,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCuZh,1621861955,"Fed's Brainard Breaks Down CBDC Policy Considerations, Sees Price Pressures Waning in the Future","Digital payments and the growth of private money are two factors helping drive an increasing focus on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), said Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard.      A number of policy considerations remain before the U.S. can assess issuing a digital dollar, she said, speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 on Monday. They include: preserving access to “safe central bank money,” increasing financial inclusion, payment and clearing efficiency, reducing cross-border frictions, complementing bank deposits and protecting both financial stability and personal privacy.      “I do believe that in the context where we maintain the role of safe central bank money as a foundation for the payment system, there’s a lot of room for competition and innovation to flourish,” she said.      While Brainard praised innovation, she said any regulatory framework must evolve and be shared across the different agencies with jurisdiction over the digital asset sector. Further, she said the U.S. should help develop the standards around cross-border payment systems, which CBDCs could provide.      “I do think some cryptocurrencies are very different, in some cases, from more traditional financial assets,” she said.      In prepared remarks, she said distributed ledger technology could lower costs, but digital assets also pose risks to cybersecurity, privacy and money laundering concerns.      The longtime public official, who served in the U.S. Treasury Department prior to her role at the central bank, has warned regulators to pay attention to the digital-asset space for years, well before many agencies began taking an active role in the industry.      Brainard revealed in 2020 that the Boston branch of the Fed was researching central bank digital currencies (CBDC) with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative. The branch is expected to publish its first report on this research later this summer.      “Unlike central bank fiat currencies, stablecoins do not have legal tender status,"" Brainard said in Monday’s speech. ""Depending on underlying arrangements, some may expose consumers and businesses to risk.""      Brainard also warned that the growth of private monies might prove detrimental to the U.S. payment system, which would in turn raise costs for businesses or households.      She likened this risk to the wildcat banking activities of the 19th century in the U.S., when private entities issued their own paper money. The era is associated with inefficiency and fraud, she said.      ""It is not obvious that new forms of private money that reference fiat currency, like stablecoins, can carry the same level of protection as bank deposits or fiat currency,"" she said.    Public-private partnerships    The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston plans to publish its first white paper detailing its research around central bank digital currencies this summer, Brainard confirmed.      “The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is launching a public–private sector collaboration as a Special Committee on Payments Inclusion to ensure that cash-based and vulnerable populations can safely access and benefit from digital payments,” Brainard said, referring to an announcement the central bank branch made earlier this month.      Similarly, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is examining how a CBDC can boost financial inclusion.    Read more: Dalio, Brainard, Lummis: Your Guide to Day 1 at Consensus 2021    This effort will identify different features and approaches that can enable people locked out of traditional financial services to access them, she said.      In response to a question from moderator and CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey, Brainard said she is paying attention to how other countries like China are developing their own CBDCs.      “The issuance of a CBDC in one jurisdiction … does potentially have significant effects across the globe,” she said. “And so it’s very important for us to follow many central banks’ progress on CBDCs.”    Private monies    Brainard also warned that the growth of private monies might prove detrimental to the U.S. payment system, which would in turn raise costs for businesses or households.      “Unlike central bank fiat currencies, stablecoins do not have legal tender status. Depending on underlying arrangements, some may expose consumers and businesses to risk,” Brainard said in Monday’s speech.

The public official also warned there have been historical risks with private monies.      “I think in a world where consumers and businesses retain access to a form of safe central bank money as part of that digital ecosystem, in fact we would see greater competition,” she said. “And that’s a good thing, it would be good to see a more dynamic, more innovative payment system foundation, a safe foundation that could provide greater opportunity for private sector participants to innovate.”    Inflation concerns    Brainard also addressed recent inflation data from April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed a 4.2% increase in prices since April 2020.      The Fed governor emphasized that supply chain bottlenecks and base effects were pushing up year-over-year inflation numbers, and that higher inflation numbers were expected from an unprecedented “surge in demand” as vaccinations allow Americans to participate in pre-pandemic activities.      “I would expect those price pressures associated with reopening and bottlenecks to subside over time,” Brainard said. “An important part is that longer term inflation expectations have been extremely well anchored.”    Read more: The Federal Reserve Is Experimenting With a Digital Dollar    While the deflationary pressures that have caused the economy to miss the Fed’s inflation targets for years could change, a new “inflation dynamic” would appear over time, Brainard added.      “If we did see inflation above our goals persistently … we have tools and experience to gently guide inflation back down to target,” Brainard said. “No one should doubt our commitment to do so.”      UPDATE (May 24, 2021, 14:15 UTC): Updated with additional context.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Nikhilesh De, Nate DiCamillo",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/24/feds-brainard-breaks-down-cbdc-policy-considerations-sees-price-pressures-waning-in-the-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8063eecb789043926b5ecf88e6c218142c6de697-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The partnership will see Opium plug into UMA's Optimistic Oracle product to provide financial derivatives for hedging risks related to SpaceX flights.  The derivatives work as binary options contracts, allowing users to purchase insurance against a failed launch on SpaceX, the Elon Musk-founded space-transportation services company.  SpaceX's SmallSat Rideshare flights allow multiple payloads to share launches into space, so bookers can send smaller, lighter payloads.  The first launch of its kind took place Jan. 24, when a Falcon 9 rocket transported 143 satellites into space.  Owners of these payloads and their stakeholders may wish to hedge the risk of a failed launch. Furthermore, the attention that a SpaceX flight draws may lead some enthusiasts to speculate on its success or otherwise and potentially profit from the outcome.  Insurance is already offered by SpaceX at about 5% of the value of the payload. Opium and UMA are attempting to compete with that.  ""If the market price is less than 5%, we can show how strong DeFi is in making insurance cheaper,"" an Opium spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""If the market sets the price at more than 5% we can invite Elon to stake money and earn free interest.""  SpaceX did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

The crypto exchange announced Monday the hiring of Faryar Shirzad as its new chief policy officer. Shirzad served 15 years at Goldman Sachs, most recently as co-head of government affairs.      Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted about how he went to Washington earlier this month in a bid to “help answer questions about crypto” for U.S. lawmakers. Shirzad will pick up the torch on that effort as the cryptocurrency industry comes under increased scrutiny from the Biden administration.    Read more: Senate Banking Chairman ‘Concerned’ by OCC’s Crypto Charters    “At Coinbase, we see collaboration with policymakers around the world as necessary to unlock the full potential of the cryptoeconomy, but also as a competitive advantage for our business,” the firm wrote in a blog post shared in advance with CoinDesk.      Shirzad will look to leverage his past experience as a White House deputy national security adviser during the George W. Bush administration. Before his time at the White House he was assistant secretary for import administration at the U.S. Department of Commerce.      The revolving door between crypto and K Street has been spinning with increased velocity this year, to the point where the New York Times has noted the phenomenon multiple times.

The BOG token price fell from $8.50 to $0.15, a drop of over 98%, according to data from CoinMarketCap  The flash loan-based attack caused the BOG token contract to be exploited by an unknown hacker, according to a Bogged blog post Sunday.  It took 45 seconds for the attack to be mitigated, enough time for the attacker to make off with $3 million worth of liquidity funds.  The attacker utilized flash loans to exploit a flaw in Bogged's smart contract to manipulate the staking rewards, leading to the minting of 15 million $BOG tokens.  Bogged now plans to migrate the current liquidity to a new contract using the same exploit as the attacker.  ""We're hoping to burn approximately 7.5 million tokens in this migration, but the exact number may change,"" Bogged said in the blog post. ""We will then airdrop the liquidity tokens back to their rightful owners, and then return $BOG legitimately owned and purchased to their owners.""  The exploit marks the latest in a number of such incidents to befall BSC-based platforms.

42389256,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJfcN,1621858992,Institutional Crypto Exchange LMAX Digital Hit Record $6.6B Volume on Bitcoin’s ‘Black Wednesday’,"LMAX Digital, the largest institutional cryptocurrency exchange, registered a record daily volume of $6.6 billion last Wednesday – a day on which bitcoin plunged almost 30% and marked an ongoing rout in the price of crypto assets across the board.      The context of this was that bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market cap, had touched an all-time high over $64,000 as recently as mid-April, having gained over 450% in six months.      Large institutions participating in this year’s crypto bull run is what arguably differentiates this cycle from 2017’s rapid price hike, which was almost all retail speculation. Since LMAX Digital is an indicator of institutional buying and selling and nothing else, a key question would be whether large players are holding more bitcoin or less as a result of the recent volatility.      “More,” said LMAX Group CEO David Mercer. “For everyone who has a long-term view, it was an opportunity to buy. Now, did they buy at $28,000; did they buy at $35,000; did they buy at $40,000? Who knows?”      In terms of LMAX Digital’s record busting $6.6 billion daily volume on what’s been called bitcoin’s “Black Wednesday,” Mercer pointed out that the number of coins traded is a better indicator than dollar amount. For bitcoin, the average price over the record-busting day was around $35,000, so something like 170,000 BTC were traded.      Many retail investors dotted around the world are trading on leverage, and when the price begins to drop that executes stop orders, which in turn executes more stop orders, leading the market into a kind of “death spiral scenario,” said Mercer.      “Institutions are largely not involved in that market, staying out. And then they see an opportunity to add to their portfolio,” Mercer said, adding:    “As a corporate entity, we added to our portfolio. I hold some bitcoin on my balance sheet. I aim for about 5% of my corporate assets to be in crypto. The price drops, so I need to rebalance it. I think every sensible institution who sees it as part of their portfolio will have added [bitcoin] on Wednesday.”  See also: Crypto Hedge Funds Show Growing Appetite for DeFi: PwC    Launched in 2018, LMAX Digital celebrates its third anniversary Monday, according to a press release.

The exchange onboarded 200 institutional investors in 2021 alone, according to the press release.      “I'm a barometer for the institutional acceptance of this asset class,” said Mercer. “If there was no institutional interest, LMAX Digital wouldn’t exist.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/24/institutional-crypto-exchange-lmax-digital-hit-record-66b-volume-on-bitcoins-black-wednesday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/beed81f0b4a8262de5ba0a728c51732e04cba9ac-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Jersey-based digital-asset investment company, which trades on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market, announced Monday a £24.7 million ($34.9 million) year-on-year increase in comprehensive income.  The 338% jump was helped by management fees and trading gains of £39.9 million ($56.4 million), an increase of £31.1 million ($44 million) on Q1 2020.  Assets under management grew almost 10-fold increase from £380 million ($537 million) a year ago to £3.4 billion ($4.8 billion).  The increase can be attributed largely to the crypto bull market that took hold in late 2020 and continued apace throughout the first quarter, and which has shown signs of slowing this month.  “In recent weeks, the cryptocurrency market has reached as high as $2.6 trillion and as low as $1.4 trillion,"" CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti said. ""And while the asset class can be volatile, even the lower of these figures reflects over half a trillion dollars of market growth since the start of the year.""  Mognetti also announced the company's intention to launch a business segment focusing on the consumer-finance market, attempting to broaden its client base beyond institutional investors.  At the net level, the company reported a first-quarter loss of £1.77 billion ($2.5 billion) compared with net income of £80 million ($113 million) the prior year.

42389272,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJgFa,1621851188,"Bitcoin, Ether Bounce After Disastrous Week for Crypto Market","The crypto market is going through a relief rally on Monday as bargain hunting is helping major coins regain some poise following last week's drubbing.      Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, is changing hands near $36,500 at press time, representing a 5% gain on the day. The rise comes after a 25% decline over the week ended May 23 – the second straight weekly loss and the biggest since March 2020, per CoinDesk 20 data.      Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is trading 8% higher at $2,257 (up 7.6%), having dropped by 41% over the same period – its most significant weekly decline on record.      Other prominent coins including Binance's BNB token, internet computer protocol (ICP) , bitcoin cash and polkadot are seeing 8% to 10% gains. Coins associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) such as LINK and UNI are trading 22% and 13% higher, respectively.      Demand from wealthy investors looks to have brought relief to the battered cryptocurrencies.      ""Crypto funds, macro funds, opportunistic venture capitalists are beginning to buy this dip in BTC, ETH as well as blue-chip DeFi by staggering limit orders and running longer time-weighted average prices,"" crypto financial services provider Amber Group tweeted early Monday.      Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio stated that he owns some bitcoin during an interview, recorded on May 6 and broadcasted Monday during Consensus by CoinDesk 2021.      “Personally, I’d rather have bitcoin than a bond” in an inflationary scenario, Dalio said during an hour-long conversation with CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael J. Casey.      The dip-buying shows large investors remain confident of long-term bullish prospects of cryptocurrencies in the wake of recent environmental and regulatory concerns. ""The long-term thesis for crypto remains unchanged. Inflation, decentralization, privacy, programmability, seizure-resistance, and censorship-resistance …these are the secular drivers of adoption,"" angel investor and entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan tweeted.      The market mood soured earlier this month after the U.S. electric car maker Tesla suspended vehicle purchases with bitcoin, citing high fossil-fuel use by miners. The surprise move dampened hopes for increased corporate adoption triggered by the company's decision to enlist bitcoin as a payments alternative in February.      Further, China, which supposedly accounts for most of the computing power dedicated to bitcoin's blockchain, reiterated its ban on cryptocurrency mining last week, drawing additional selling pressure for the cryptocurrency.      Bitcoin fell to a 3.5-month low of $30,000 last week, marking a 53% drop from the record high of $64,801 reached on April 14. Meanwhile, ether fell to below $2,000.      The downturn was largely the result of selling by ""weak hands"" and short-term traders. ""From the end of April until now, wallet addresses holding bitcoin for less than one month dropped from 5.06 million addresses to 4.37 million, a loss of 690,000,"" the Defiant Newsletter said on May 18.      However, the number of addresses holding bitcoin for more than one year, dubbed as ""holders"" by IntoTheBlock, increased by 120,000 from 21.81 million to 21.93 million.      Moving ahead, a V-shaped recovery to $50,000 and higher may remain elusive, as the recent sell-off has shaken investor confidence. Moreover, according to some observers, the market may soon receive more negative news out of China. On Friday, a top Chinese governmental body called for a crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, amplifying regulatory concerns.      Some industry experts believe the negative news has been priced in, and the psychological support at $30,000 is likely to hold.      ""Historically, such news from China (regarding mining and trading bans) have resulted in major drops for BTC, and this time is no different,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, said. ""However, like the previous instances, BTC does recover, and the latest news isn't reflecting any new developments per se.""

BOK’s research into the issuance of a CBDC was published in February, and determined that it could be treated as fiat currency, not a crypto asset, and could therefore be exchanged freely with cash.

42389254,4DXd9IO1qFg1ZzPOBjJfYo,1621814400,Crypto Hedge Funds Show Growing Appetite for DeFi: PwC,"Crypto hedge funds managed nearly $3.8 billion in 2020, up from $2 billion in 2019, and are showing a taste for decentralized finance (DeFi), according to a new report from PwC and the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA).      Released Monday, the third annual Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report, co-authored by Elwood Asset Management, shows that 31% of crypto hedge funds use decentralized exchanges (DEXs), with Uniswap being the most widely used (16%), followed by 1inch (8%) and SushiSwap (4%).      Meanwhile, DeFi-specific tokens are on the rise: oracle service Chainlink's LINK was included in 30% of hedge fund investments, with interoperability protocol Polkadot's DOT and lending platform Aave's AAVE making up 28% and 27%, respectively.      The DeFi space has seen explosive growth in recent months, with the total value locked in Ethereum-based DeFi platforms now sitting at $60 billion, according to DeFi Pulse.      Meanwhile, some large traditional hedge funds like Steven Cohen’s Point72 are reported to be taking an interest in DeFi, as part of a strategy of setting up crypto-focused funds.

Crypto hedge funds are also involved in cryptocurrency staking (42%), lending (33%) and borrowing (24%).      There is also increased interest in DeFi from some of the more traditional financial institutions, PwC Crypto Leader Henri Arslanian said in an email.      “Whilst they may be still far from using decentralized applications, many financial institutions are trying to be more educated and try to understand the potential impact that DeFi may have on the future of financial services,” Arslanian wrote.

The vast majority of investors in such funds are either high-net-worth individuals (54%) or family offices (30%). The percentage of crypto hedge funds with over $20 million in AUM increased in 2020 from 35% to 46%.      Meanwhile, 47% of traditional hedge fund managers surveyed, representing $180 billion of AUM, are already invested or looking at investing in crypto, according to the report.      “The fact that we have partnered with AIMA and included traditional hedge funds for this year’s report is an indication of how fast crypto is becoming more mainstream with institutional investors,” said Arslanian. “This would have been unthinkable even 12 months ago.”",POSITIVE,DOT | ETH | LINK,BTC | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | LINK,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/24/crypto-hedge-funds-show-growing-appetite-for-defi-pwc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27fdc803a71c0a751bab2e01c3eda05a03e2b773-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
