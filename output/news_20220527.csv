This first-of-its-kind streak had cemented the digital asset on one of the worst bearish trends that have ever been recorded. Now, even as the week runs towards another close, the cryptocurrency has not been able to make any considerable recovery, indicating that it may not be done with its bearish streak. Bitcoin Headed For A Ninth Red Close? With bitcoin still trading well below $30,000, it is no long shot to speculate that the digital asset may close out this week in the red too. If it does so, then it will break its previous record while plunging the market into even worse bearish trends. Nine consecutive weekly closes would prove that bulls have mainly relinquished control of the market, meaning the bears have the leeway to pull the market down further.

42421541,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocW5,1653689843,How the US Can Establish Itself as a Crypto Leader,"The week of the terraUSD (UST) collapse was among the most painful weeks in crypto history – and one we’ll reckon with for a long time. It wrought havoc on the crypto market, resulting in billions of dollars in lost value. And while those in Washington, D.C., rightly debate next steps, a smart, thoughtful conversation around potential regulation is critical.  Stablecoins are a vital innovation, providing many benefits for users and a competitive advantage for the United States. Stablecoins improve efficiency in payments and transfers, reducing costs and accelerating settlement for businesses and consumers. They make the financial system more inclusive by offering open access to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their background or economic status. They can also advance U.S. geopolitical interests, strengthening global dollar dominance in the face of attempts by our adversaries – such as China and Russia – to undermine U.S. leadership in the financial system.  Jake Chervinsky is head of policy at the Blockchain Association.  As the name suggests, stablecoins are intended to be stable and reliable. In general, there are two broad categories of stablecoins: custodial and decentralized.  Custodial stablecoins are issued by a central administrator and backed by collateral held in a bank or other institution. They are usually fully collateralized: The issuer holds one dollar in the bank for every one dollar of stablecoins it issues. Custodial stablecoins represent the vast majority of total stablecoin volume and are very stable and reliable, provided the issuer is trustworthy and transparent.  Decentralized stablecoins are designed to address the fact that not all issuers are trustworthy or transparent. Their goal – much like the public blockchains that enable them – is to eliminate dependence on trusted intermediaries in the financial system, who often do more harm than good. They achieve that goal by producing stablecoins that seek to maintain their peg to the dollar through the operation of autonomous code rather than reliance on a central issuer. Instead of being backed by dollars in a bank, decentralized stablecoins are typically backed by other digital assets held programmatically as collateral on the blockchain.  Importantly, although custodial and decentralized stablecoins use different models, neither is fundamentally better or worse than the other. Each has unique properties – both benefits and risks – that combine to form a robust, competitive market characterized by consumer choice. We should support responsible innovation in both categories.  Read More: Secure America’s Financial Strength With Stablecoins, Not Central Banks  Unfortunately, UST was in a category of its own, relying solely on an algorithmic mechanism to maintain price stability with no collateral whatsoever, a risky model that many predicted might fail.  So, following this month’s events, how should policymakers respond?  First, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen indicated in congressional testimony on May 12, policymakers should follow the process set forth by President Joe Biden’s executive order (EO) earlier this year. The EO – directing federal agencies to study crypto and report on regulatory priorities and solutions – provides clear guidance on how to thoughtfully proceed on stablecoin regulation. That work is important and ongoing. With the help of input from industry stakeholders and trade groups like my employer, the Blockchain Association, policymakers should develop a strong understanding of the stablecoin space and the essential differences between various stablecoin designs. This is a necessary first step before effective regulation can be formulated.  Second, a bipartisan consensus should be developed in Congress. Immediately following UST’s collapse, Congress became entrenched on either side of the aisle over the issue. But as my colleague Kristin Smith recently wrote, crypto is too big for partisan politics. We need leaders on both sides of the aisle to come together and determine the best regulatory approach for crypto. As the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) recommended in its report on stablecoins last year, a regulatory solution must come from Congress – not from the regulatory agencies.  Third, new regulations should be adopted that are fit for the purpose. These policies must be balanced and consider the essential nature of dollar-dominated stablecoins to U.S. financial security in the coming decades. We need tailored regulatory frameworks that address the specific benefits and risks of stablecoins. For custodial stablecoins, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) separately proposed tailored frameworks – great examples of smart regulatory approaches from both sides of the aisle in the Senate and House of Representatives. With time, we can develop similarly well-tailored frameworks for decentralized stablecoins, too.  Stablecoins present too big an opportunity for us to risk getting them wrong as a matter of policy. The U.S. is in a competitive international race to be the home of Web 3. It’s time for strategic thought and deliberate action. The future of the U.S. as a hub of global crypto innovation hangs in the balance.  Read More: What's the Point of Stablecoins?

42421587,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoec9,1653688759,"No, the UK Is Not Going to Make USDC and USDT Legal Tender","Following the recent crypto crash came news the U.K. government would “legalize” stablecoins. Crypto supporters on Twitter took this to mean the leading reserved stablecoins – USDT and USDC – would become legal tender in the U.K.  But stablecoins don’t need to be legal tender to be used for payments. They don’t even need to be “legalized.” It’s perfectly legal for people in the U.K. to use USDC, USDT or any other stablecoin – including algorithmic stablecoins – and many people do.  Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.  Currently, stablecoins are only used on crypto exchanges, not in mainstream payments systems. But it isn’t necessary to make them legal tender for them to be used for mainstream payments. The U.K. has a fast, cheap, comprehensive e-payment system to which banks are the gateways. The vast majority of payments in the U.K. use this system. Newer technologies such as PayPal can also be used for many retail purchases.  None of these payments involve legal tender. Debit cards, credit cards, bank transfers, checks, mobile money, PayPal – not one of these is legal tender in the U.K. In England, only banknotes and coins are legal tender, and low-denomination coins are only legal tender for amounts up to 20 pence (US25 cents). In Scotland, only coins are legal tender.  Read More: Why Stablecoin Interest Rates Are So Damn High  Merchants are not obliged to accept legal tender. In England, a 50 pound note is legal tender, but if you try paying for a bus ride with it, you’ll be told to get on your bike. But you can pay with a contactless debit card, which isn’t legal tender.  So as the Bank of England says, legal tender “has no use in everyday life.” It exists for one specific purpose only. Legal tender discharges a debt whether or not the creditor accepts it. The Bank of England also says that “if you offer to fully pay off a debt to someone in legal tender, they can’t sue you for failing to repay.”  Legal tender law dates from a time when people could be imprisoned for failing to pay their debts if creditors didn’t like the coin they offered. In the 19th century, London’s notorious Marshalsea Prison housed huge numbers of defaulted debtors, including people who had money. In Charles Dickens’s novel “Little Dorrit,” Amy Dorrit’s father was a long-term resident of Marshalsea because his debts were so numerous and complex that no one could work out how to pay them off.  These days, we no longer send people to the Marshalsea Prison for failing to pay their debts. But offering to pay in legal tender can still get a creditor off your back. However, both creditors and courts would much rather receive a bank transfer or debit card payment. Legal tender is a nuisance.  With physical cash going into terminal decline, you’d think that lawmakers would want to authorize other media of exchange as legal tender, wouldn’t you? But as payments work perfectly well whether or not legal tender is involved, and the vast majority of debts are settled without legal tender, there’s no urgency to update the laws.  So money doesn’t have to be legal tender to be used for mainstream payments. It just needs to be widely accepted. Making stablecoins legal tender may help to instill confidence in them, but far more important is regulating them so they are perceived as safe. The U.K. has a comprehensive system of regulation to ensure that electronic payments are safe. Bringing stablecoins into this system of regulation would encourage their widespread use.  And this seems to be what the U.K. government intends to do. A U.K. Treasury source quoted in The Telegraph newspaper said that “legislation to regulate stablecoins where used as a means of payment” would be included in the Finance and Markets Bill announced in the recent Queen’s Speech.  So for “legalize” read “regulate.” Using regulated stablecoins for mainstream payments could break the banks’ stranglehold on the U.K.’s payments system and potentially improve financial inclusion. But which stablecoins would qualify?  Read More: Regulating Stablecoins for What They Are  Well, USDT and USDC wouldn’t. The U.K. does not use the U.S. dollar, so it wouldn’t make any sense at all for these stablecoins to be used for mainstream payments within the U.K. And their issuers don’t currently issue stablecoins pegged to the British pound. If the U.K. explicitly encouraged merchants to accept GBP stablecoins, perhaps Circle and Tether might issue them.  But there’s another group of financial institutions that might issue regulated stablecoins for use in the British market: British banks. After all, they won’t want to lose control of the payments marketplace. And both Tether and Circle are foreign companies in the U.K. Tether is incorporated in Hong Kong, which is no longer a British colony, and Circle is based in Boston, Mass. If U.K. regulators favored stablecoins issued by Circle and Tether over stablecoins issued by U.K. banks, there would be heavy lobbying not just from the banks but from politicians and pundits determined to “keep payments British.”  And there is one further institution that might want to issue a regulated GBP stablecoin and indeed has been looking into doing so. That is the Bank of England. The U.K.’s legislative upper chamber, the House of Lords, recently cast shade on the idea, saying it was “a solution in search of a problem.” But if the future of payments is to be stablecoins, then the central bank will surely want to be in on the act.  So the U.K. is not proposing to make USDC and USDT legal tender. It’s not even proposing to “legalize” them, because they are already legal in the U.K. It’s proposing to regulate them. And that may mean they can never be used in mainstream payments systems in the U.K.  Rather than the open door to existing stablecoins that stablecoin aficionados thought this would be, it’s a qualified welcome for new GBP-pegged stablecoins from trusted British issuers – and an invitation to U.K. banks and the Bank of England to get on with issuing them.

42421589,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeeD,1653688731,Thoughts From Davos,"Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney ditched me for Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio as European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walked past in the Congress Centre at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.  And somehow that was only the second-most surreal thing to happen to me this week.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The badgeless  The narrative  A very nice gentleman I met in Davos told me there were about 2,500 official delegates at the World Economic Forum (WEF) this year, and about 3,500 people from the crypto industry on the Promenade outside the main event.  Why it matters  The crypto industry’s attendance at the meeting and the side events outside were meant to be a signal. Crypto, as an industry, should be taken seriously. However, the point of setting up a “house” in Davos on the famed Promenade outside the main WEF meeting is to get your name out there – to show that you have a real brand. It’s not to secure a quick return on investment. As the crypto market continues in its latest bear market (amid broader economic turmoil), the question is what sort of return this actually looks like.  Breaking it down  Crypto has arrived.  Two days in a row, on the train back to my AirBnB after panels at the WEF annual meeting, I met people who are involved in the crypto industry. Attendees who ventured outside of the Congress Centre, where the main panels were held, came face to face with posters and advertisements from different crypto companies. Panelists in various sessions brought up crypto unprompted. I went to a dinner hosted by an entity that has nothing to do with crypto and met someone who invested in certain cryptocurrencies years ago (and he was the second crypto investor I met at dinners!).  Clearly this industry is on people’s minds in some way, shape or form. The question is whether the crypto presence was worth it.  Industry participants paid massively for the privilege of splashing their banners across various buildings. No one shared any specific figures but it’s Davos. In a normal year, companies are competing with financial giants and lauded tech firms. This year, Accenture, SalesForce, Meta (formerly Facebook) and surveillance firm Palantir all set up facilities.  The rescheduling of Davos to May seems to have really thrown things off. Numerous people told me that this year’s event was much smaller than normal. It certainly ended very abruptly, with the security gates blocking off the Congress Centre taken down very quickly by early afternoon Thursday, despite the fact that in theory the event was still underway.  In other words, it’s possible, even plausible, that the crypto industry was able to take advantage of a gap in normal sponsorships to get a foot in the door, so to speak. It’s far too early to know whether they'll be able to repeat this during a normal WEF meeting (the next one will be Jan. 15-20, 2023). Matthew Blake, head of the future of financial and monetary systems at the WEF, told me that the annual meeting wouldn’t have any crypto panels if there wasn’t interest from multiple parties.  “Everything that we do from a thematic and research basis has a multi-stakeholder property to it,” Blake said. “That's kind of core to how we operate. And the answer is absolutely, I mean, I think one of the key areas where we've seen keen interest from central banks around the world is in the [central bank digital currency] space … We're doing interviews around the world with members of parliament, you know, central banking authorities, ministers of finance, and so on. I think there's a combination of like trying to understand the evolution of this space and staying on top of it.”  Even central bankers and finance regulators – though not necessarily welcoming crypto with open arms – are at least tolerating the sector.  The International Monetary Fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, told a panel discussing central bank digital currencies “not to pull out of” the cryptocurrency sector, adding that it is important to “separate apples from oranges and bananas.”  Others were more explicitly pro-regulation  Here are some thoughts on how the CoinDesk team approached this year’s event, and what we can or should do next year.  First off, I overestimated our access to reliable internet. A few of you pinged on Telegram but those messages usually came in hours later and didn’t load when the notifications came in. So that was definitely a bit of an unwelcome surprise.  I definitely started planning a bit late, considering how much happened during the week.  Still, given all the uncertainties and setbacks, I’m really proud of the team we sent. On the reporting side, we had myself, Sandali Handagama and Helene Braun, both of whom I think excelled (more of their coverage is coming in the next week).  I also didn’t realize just how nonstop the whole thing would be. While I expected it to be a bit chaotic, this felt far more like Consensus 2018 than Consensus 2019 (the real mid-Gs here know what I’m talking about). Still, to be clear, I think this was both a fun and productive time.  Speaking of which…  Consensus 2022  CoinDesk will be in Austin, Texas June 9-12 for Consensus 2022, the long-awaited return of our IRL event after two years of virtual forums. It’ll be exciting!  On Friday, June 10, I’ll moderate a one-on-one discussion with Deputy Treasury Secretary Adewale Adeyemo. If you would like to ask a question, email stateofcrypto@coindesk.com with your query. I’ll ask the best ones on stage.  We’ll also have a panel discussion with a team from the Federal Reserve focused on innovation and the U.S. central bank’s role. You can send your questions for the Fed officials to stateofcrypto@coindesk.com as well.  Some other interesting panels:  Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam and former CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump will take part in a fireside chat with CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey.  We’ll have a digital dollar debate with Dante Disparte, Rohan Grey and Caitlin Long, moderated by Forkast News’ Angie Lau.  We’ll have a lawmaker town hall featuring a handful of U.S. senators and congresspeople, moderated by CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton.  Hope to see you in Austin!  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  I’m going to be honest, I have no idea if anything happened this week. I promise to catch up before Tuesday, though.  Elsewhere:  At Davos, Crypto Is No Longer on the Outside: Our first dispatch from the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, taking a look at just how much the industry has embedded itself this year.  Mastercard CEO Teases CBDC Panel: SWIFT May Not Exist in 5 Years: This was a weird one. Was Michael Miebach joking? Who knows. Sure, why not, let’s go with that.

Still, there must be a conclusive close above this week&apos;s highs at $30 for a trend continuation. A close above this mark may lift prices to May 2022 highs of $41. On the reverse side, losses below $20 may trigger a sell-off towards $14. What to Expect After Cream Finance Technical Analysis? Technically, the token is bearish despite today&apos;s attempts. There will be more room for more upsides if bulls build on today&apos;s gains.

42421588,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoedB,1653684083,Crypto's One Unassailable Use Case: Helping Human Rights Activists,"Attendees at this week’s Oslo Freedom Forum, a 13-year-old annual gathering for human rights and pro-democracy activists, might have wondered at times if they’d mistakenly wandered into a cryptocurrency conference.  Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song’s signature cowboy hat could be spotted here and there at the Oslo Concert Hall, where the forum, organized by the Human Rights Foundation, took place. The erudite investor and entrepreneur Nic Carter strolled around with an umbrella cane. On stage, author and podcaster Laura Shin interviewed a non-fungible token (NFT) artist. The stalwarts of Bitcoin and Lightning Network development held workshops on using the currency, and crypto CEOs discussed hedging strategies for a potential ban on stablecoins backstage.  A crypto conference, of course, would not normally feature human rights activists recounting their first-hand experience of political oppression, investigative journalists sharing how they fight propaganda and cybersecurity specialists checking phones for traces of spyware.  But if you think about it, crypto events maybe could be a little more about those kinds of things.  While for many crypto is a way to get rich, for others it’s a human rights tool, providing sometimes clumsy but still serviceable ways to route around financial censorship and surveillance, especially in those parts of the world where such measures are prevalent.  And that use case is not going away, no matter which direction the price of bitcoin (BTC) goes.  Using Bitcoin  “If no one values bitcoin other than a penny, we’re still able to [move value across the world] and fight for freedom,” said Jack Mallers, CEO of bitcoin payments startup Strike, sporting an orange and violet sweater and “Miracle Academy” hat on stage.  Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation and the curator of the financial freedom track at the Oslo Freedom Forum, was asked if he believes the activist community is warming up to crypto. He replied that the reason he incorporates bitcoin content into the program is “because many organizations are already using it.” In some cases, they do so thanks to him.  Meron Estefanos, a human rights activist helping to free victims of human traffickers in Eritrea, says she was skeptical about bitcoin at first, but warmed to it after attending Gladstein’s workshops. At the same time, the government in Eritrea was tightening the screws on Hawala, the centuries-old remittances system relying on a network of people passing cash between each other across borders.  Now, Hawala brokers are asking for their clients’ names “and I can not send my mom any money using my name” because the authorities in Eritrea are after her for her human rights advocacy, says Estefanos, who is based in Sweden. So bitcoin became a remittance channel for her: Now, she is paying a team of researchers in bitcoin to help her.  For activists from Russia whose work has sent them into exile, bitcoin also became a lifeline connecting people to the ones they left behind at home, said Leonid Volkov, who managed crypto donations for Alexey Navalny, the imprisoned Russian opposition leader.  “After our movement was outlawed in Russia and we were forced to relocate abroad, we realized bitcoin is very important as we can use it to support our friends and colleagues back in Russia. Because otherwise, they would be receiving money from ‘terrorists,’” Volkov said, referring to how the government is labeling Navalny’s organization, the Anti-Corruption Foundation.  Read more: Bitcoin Donations to Navalny Surge After Russian Opposition Leader Is Jailed  Bitcoin can serve as an underground payment channel in regimes with abusive financial surveillance, when receiving money from abroad puts activists in the authorities’ crosshairs. That was the case when Students for Liberty, a U.S. non-governmental organization (NGO) supporting student protests around the globe, needed to send money to a student in China.  “We sent a payment, and the next day he was summoned to the police station to explain what that was about,” Wolf von Laer, the organization’s CEO, said. He also told CoinDesk he sent bitcoin to some of his staff in Ukraine when they needed to evacuate from a dangerous area during the ongoing military invasion by Russia.  Stablecoin concerns  At least partly due to Gladstein’s own long-term devotion to bitcoin, most crypto-related panels at the forum have been dedicated to the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, with a series of practical workshops on various software and services for bitcoin payments.  However, stablecoins also got some attention during a panel with Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino and Ire Aderinokun, co-founder of African crypto firm Helicarrier.  Ardoino assured the audience Tether was capable of redeeming its stablecoin, USDT, in large amounts even in times of crisis, like the one that took place after the Terra protocol’s UST, an algorithmic stablecoin, and its sister cryptocurrency LUNA crashed.  Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  The audience seemed to receive Ardoino’s talk well. After the panel, however, he was approached by Obi Nwosu, the founder of U.K. crypto exchange Coinfloor. He asked what kind of insurance could be created against the risk of Tether failing, especially for holders in countries where they can’t receive U.S. dollars in exchange for USDT.  “I think that Tether would fail only if the governments ban it,” Nwosu said. They discussed a possibility to create a kind of insurance policy when USDT holders would receive as much bitcoin as their tethers were supposed to be worth, but the question how exactly that should work was left open for now.  The question of Tether’s reliability and resilience is especially important for people deprived of access to financial services, who are vulnerable to the quirks of their own unstable economies and see USDT as the only available substitute to a U.S. dollar-denominated bank account. Nigeria is one example, Aderinokun said.  “Dollar-denominated accounts are not accessible to everyone and you need to be spending $20 a month” in fees to keep one, she said. “And you might wake up one day to realize the government has converted all your dollars to naira.”  A grain of salt  The human rights angle, in addition to being one of the strongest arguments in favor of cryptocurrencies’ existence, also balances out parts of the crypto narrative in which arrogance, greed and other unsavory aspects of human nature often steal the show.  Nelson Rauda, a Salvadoran investigative journalist for El Faro, poured cold water on the much-touted change in El Salvador, which recognized bitcoin as a legal tender last year after a push from President Nayib Bukele.  While bitcoiners wrote elated tweets over the move, for ordinary Salvadorians, who are concerned about losing the little money they have to bitcoin’s volatility or the flaws of the government-blessed bitcoin wallet, nothing exciting has happened so far, Rauda said. “Go to the streets and you’ll see that people are not taking it.”  And the rhetoric of rich bitcoiners telling not-so-rich Salvadorians how bright their future will be is galling, especially when it comes to “Bitcoin City,” a techno-utopian project to transform the city of La Union into a place where the local economy runs on bitcoin.  The project might “erase” the community living in La Union, whose homes are slated to be demolished to build Bukele’s dream, Rauda said.  “I was last week in the house of a fisherman, who is being displaced, and the community is being displaced by millionaires that are going to support Bitcoin City,” he said, adding:  “Bitcoin has roots in the cypherpunk movement. It was created by people who were activists. How did this change to millionaires flying around on helicopters in Salvador? It makes no sense to me.”  Maybe that’s something to discuss at the regular crypto conferences, too.  UPDATE (June 4, 17:43 UTC): Fixes typo in seventh paragraph.

42421568,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeOj,1653683402,"Who Are We in the Metaverse, and How Do We Prove It?","Soon enough we'll all be interacting with the metaverse and Web 3 as often as we do with the current iteration of the internet. Yet, unlike Web 2, this next-gen web will feel a little more lifelike.  Web 3 has an opportunity to include a “self-sovereign identity layer” that will also be our primary passport into the metaverse. Self-sovereign identity will solve many of the internet’s current issues and may even let us rethink how we represent – and prove – who we are.  JP Bedoya is the chief product officer at Civic. This article is part of “Metaverse Week.""  Self-sovereign identity means you as an individual own the data you produce or bring online. It’s “sovereign” because you can choose to share certain elements of that data only up to the point that's required, and no more, to reach a desired end.  With Web 3 uniting so many different areas of our digital and physical lives, there is a need for precise control over how we are represented across these various spheres.  The endpoint is essentially where you access goods, services or join digital communities. Self-sovereign identity, from a foundational point of view, is comprised of multiple elements.  Private, yet accessible and scalable  Companies are interested in users, first and foremost. Everything they do, from initial design to marketing, is in the service of a variation on one main question: Can this help bring in more users? Can this help us bring them on in a friction-free way? Is there an easier way to ""acquire"" them? And so, as companies build out their ""Web 3 strategies,"" they must think about customers in the metaverse.  A company’s approach to identity will determine a lot about their relationship with users. If the process is cumbersome, invasive and repetitious they will drive many potential customers away. The onboarding process must be user friendly and most of all, as fast as possible.  When users are forced to enter information multiple times, or upload multiple pieces of identification, then wait 48 hours or more to have these documents approved, then still have steps they must go through to finalize, it becomes too much.  See also: Self-Sovereign Identity in 2030 Explained  Compelling people to drop out of their acquisition funnel is a business risk. Crypto companies are uniquely aware of the need for know-your-customer requirements – if only to turn bad actors away at the door. Of course, some will slip through, and that's the cost of doing business.  A Web 3 developer’s goal in providing identity solutions is to deliver the highest level of trust without getting in the way of user acquisition. Composable, reusable and cross-chain identity solutions are a must in this regard.  A one-click ID verification process will benefit all of Web 3.  Levels of identity  But who are we in the metaverse?  Well, who do we want to be? Identity doesn’t have to be an existential crisis. For example, on LinkedIn you may present yourself as a professional, on Twitter you may be less formal and on Discord you're probably an anonymous degen divorced completely from the person you see in the mirror.  With self-sovereign identity solutions in the metaverse, we can tailor our public-facing identities. We can choose how we’re represented.  On social media platforms today, companies often know who the person is behind the avatar. We provide verifiable information when we create an account, but we don’t get to control how that data is used. These Web 2 platforms store, control and repurpose the data.  However, Web 3 identity standards applied to the metaverse – perhaps using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which may be anonymous – our identities will be reducible to the verifiable information on a blockchain. We will decide what exact pieces of data a counterparty actually needs to review or what we want to share.  Tokenized identity is also always already validated, thereby erasing the the repetitious need to create logins, passwords and backup solutions for websites with a firewall.  These layers of identity can be applied dynamically across all platforms at all times. This is exactly how an interconnected metaverse should be designed.  NFTs as building blocks of social identity  Our crypto wallets are becoming representative of us on Web 3, and the NFTs in those wallets are a genuine, if non-legal digital identity. We are what we do on the blockchain. NFTs show what communities we are passionate about, our goals, our values – and they can do it in a dynamic, ever-changing way without even using words. (A profile pic is worth 1,000 words.)  NFTs are an aesthetic language, appropriate for today's internet denizens so focused on high resolution images and video content. Are NFTs the final step in representational identity on the web, or just a quick stop on a longer journey? What lies beyond JPEGs?  See also: JPEGs On Sale, Baby | Opinion  Humans are tribal, we want to belong and integrate ourselves in like-minded communities that are focused on the things we are passionate about. And, just as we have since the dawn of humanity, we submit to our innate urges to form tribes, develop communication standards and protect one another.  NFT communities speak to this primal (or if you're a member of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, primitive or simian) desire to belong. Of course, when communities form without the constraints of physical space, things get strange. Our identities become more fluid.  From a bird’s eye view of this primitive, yet technical industry, the metaverse's horizon appears endless and so does our ability to recreate ourselves. And so we must work to preserve the freedom of individuals to self-identify by building those technical capabilities into the DNA of Web 3.

Crypto traders are still in risk-off mode after experiencing almost nine consecutive weeks of negative returns. BTC is on track for a 27% decline this month, although it is up 10% from its recent extreme low at $25,840 on May 12.  The cryptocurrency is still down by 40% so far this year, compared with a 13% drop in the S&P 500 and a 22% dip in the Nasdaq 100 over the same period. So far, it has been a tough year for all speculative assets.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Over the short term, however, prices could stabilize. ""There’s been massive short selling over the last few weeks, which may presage a short squeeze in the weeks ahead. Month-end rebalancing flows may also help,"" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase, wrote in a Friday newsletter.  And on the macro front, MRB Partners, a global investment research firm, expects equity markets to rebound should global growth conditions prove resilient. The firm is""[a]ssuming interest rate expectations and bond yields stay calm for a period of time, which is probable as inflation will temporarily decelerate, first in the U.S. and then elsewhere. Central banks, in turn, likely will briefly cool their newfound hawkishness,"" MRB wrote in an email.  The short-term rise in stocks could be a tailwind for crypto, assuming the high correlation between both assets remains intact. In contrast, perhaps the decline in cryptos signals limited upside in stocks as risk-off sentiment prevails.

42417136,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3Xp,1653682037,The Metaverse Is Struggling to Hold Onto Users. Sports Could Fix That,"A range of industries have struggled to forge deeper, longer-lasting relationships with audiences in the metaverse. However, with its passionate fan bases and iconic teams and events, the sports sector may have the most success in creating this type of engagement. Metaverse initiatives from some of the world’s best-known sports organizations, including its most iconic teams, are already showing enough promise for these groups and the platforms serving the metaverse to expand their efforts in this area.  “Sports is going to become really big in [in the metaverse] in the next six months,” Sam Hamilton, creative director of Decentraland Foundation, told CoinDesk.  Daniela Dib is a business and tech reporter based in Mexico City.  In many ways, sports are a natural fit for the metaverse, combining fantasy and a passionate audience. It’s also an industry that has successfully experimented with crypto.  According to CryptoSlam, non-fungible token (NFT) sales at as part of NBA Top Shot grew by 72% last January. Its creator Dapper Labs, which has partnered with major sports leagues, is currently valued at $7.8 billion.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Metaverse Week.  Other projects are also banking on sports’ popularity to find a larger gateway for crypto adoption. Bitso, one of Latin America’s largest crypto exchanges at over four million users, is now a main sponsor of Mexico’s national soccer team. In March, NFT platform SportsIcon unveiled plans for a sports-focused metaverse that will allow athletes to interact with supporters.  Earlier this month, Italy’s top soccer division collaborated with ConsenSys and video gaming platform The Nemesis to broadcast its first soccer match on the metaverse. FIFA, soccer's global governing body, locked in Algorand as an official blockchain partner before the World Cup competition that starts in November in Qatar. All of the above doesn’t include the various NFTs minted to honor famous athletes and their most celebrated accomplishments.  Decentraland and sports  Decentraland, which is building a metaverse on the Ethereum blockchain, is also developing a virtual sports infrastructure. It recently announced that the Spanish sports platform StadioPlus will manage NFT sports content in Vegas City, one of Decentraland’s largest districts focused on entertainment.  Read More: How to Make It in the Metaverse  Hamilton believes the sports industry’s participation in the metaverse is just dawning and hinted that the protocol he helps oversee will be increasing its metaverse involvement significantly in the next six months. Decentraland and other platforms have noted that some metaverse initiatives have done a better job attracting audiences than keeping them.  Although Decentraland has sold 172 NFTs at an average price of $6,100 during the past week, according to the NFT Stats tracker, it is struggling to keep users engaged. There are only around 1,200 active players on the platform, according to publicly available data.  Decentraland Executive Director Agustín Ferreira said sports are part of the“compelling content” the platform is creating in hopes of emerging strongly from the current crypto downturn that has hit alternative coin (altcoin) protocols particularly hard. They are also a way to keep users entertained.  “We do content and run events because people enjoy them,” Ferreira told CoinDesk. “They’re an opportunity for us to build, prepare for the next round and make the most of the next bull market.”  The Decentraland executives are aware the current slow pace of adoption and engagement is normal for such a young industry. “We’re still very early, and we’ll be developing this for the next 20 or 30 years,” Ferreira said.  Sports may be of particular interest for many Latin American users who are already flocking to Decentraland and are among the world’s most ardent fans.  “This demographic is really starting to onboard in Decentraland, with a lot of brands and communities growing slowly,” he said. “Cryptocurrencies are a tool for regions like this.”  Read More: How Do You Value Metaverse Projects?

42417141,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3cz,1653679818,Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Metaverse (but Were Afraid to Ask),"Depending on your relationship to video games and artificial intelligence (AI), the metaverse may incite fears of a dystopian future or a happy virtual reality.  You can’t bring up the metaverse to someone and expect the conversation to be simple and digestible. There’s no singular definition of what exactly the metaverse is, for starters, but beyond initial confusion, people worry. How will data be used? Will virtual relationships replace human touch? The anxiety has range and many flavors.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Metaverse Week  Yet, so does the excitement: Does a metaverse future mean online shopping for the right-sized piece of clothing will be easier, thanks to custom-sized avatars? Will Web 3 finally force advertisers to learn from big tech’s mistakes and respect consumer privacy? And will people be able to earn universal basic income via crypto tokens for playing games online and going to their favorite metaverse concerts from their computers? (If so, introverts rejoice!)  Everyone – even the experts – has questions about the metaverse. So we decided to compile some of the questions we hear a lot, along with some we imagine you’re dying to ask and got answers.  What is the metaverse?  We’re starting with the basics, because there’s no room for imposter syndrome in Web 3. What’s the metaverse, exactly?  Poet and non-fungible token (NFT) artist Sasha Stiles speaks of the metaverse by looking at the word itself: The Greek prefix “meta” means higher, beyond, often even transcending. And the “verse” part comes from the word “universe,” to indicate that the metaverse is a universe that transcends the one we currently inhabit.  Yes, this is a philosophical definition. Bringing it back down to earth, the metaverse is a technological infrastructure that allows for human interaction to move beyond physical and geographic barriers. In some ways, we’ve already been living in the metaverse. Gamers certainly have been with not only virtual-reality games, digital avatars and online communities, but even in-game concerts in Fortnite from the likes of Travis Scott.  Most metaverse enthusiasts argue that the global coronavirus pandemic accelerated the use of technology, and now many of us are used to having interactions across technology, whether on Zoom work calls, Face Time with family members or selling physical wares on Facebook Marketplace. The metaverse as people in Web 3 know it will simply enhance these experiences by equipping consumers with digital wallets containing their cryptocurrency (money) and any digital assets they own in the form of NFTs.  “The metaverse is an immersive universal 3D overlay on real life,” said Isla Perfito, co-founder and CEO of Sator, a blockchain-based entertainment platform. “As an alternate form of reality, we are able to navigate the virtual worlds as we would the physical, you are able to move and interact as you would in real life with the added ability to defy the physics we are bound to as humans on planet Earth.”  How to access the metaverse  To participate in the metaverse, you need a compatible crypto wallet. Most popular metaverse worlds and gaming platforms operate on the Ethereum blockchain, but some operate on Solana or other layer 1 blockchains. To enter a metaverse, you need to sign up for a wallet that works on whatever blockchain the world is built on, then link it in your internet browser.  Here are some popular metaverse and gaming platforms and what blockchains they operate on:  Ethereum blockchain  Decentraland  The Sandbox  Axie Infinity  Enjin  Solana blockchain  Somnium Space  Galactic Marketplace  Polygon  CryptoTanks  BNB Chain  Metahero  You can also get fully immersed by wearing a set of VR goggles, which let you control your avatar with your own physical movements, but it's not required.  What is ownership in the metaverse?  So, if everything is digital, what do you actually own in the metaverse?  Imagine you’re a video game player, and you collect a special token or prize that gives you extra lives. In the video game, your avatar could store these items in a digital backpack. That’s an easy enough concept that anyone who’s collected gold coins while playing Super Mario can understand.  In the metaverse, ownership will (and already does) operate similarly. Except now, thanks to blockchain technology, you can create a digital deed (aka record) of this transaction. Blockchain is a giant digital ledger that stores all of this information forever, and your assets don’t go away just because you turn off the computer or gaming console.  Taking things a step further, metaverse companies are finding ways to expand the definition of digital ownership beyond just video game prizes. The platform Mirror lets writers post content for others to consume, and readers may decide to offer the creator cryptocurrency for it in exchange for some type of ownership.  Read More: How to Invest in the Metaverse  Brave, an internet browser, lets users opt in to the amount of ads they want to see. When users choose to view more ads, they are rewarded with Brave Attention Tokens (BAT), which get stored in a crypto wallet for consumers to use how they wish.  Similarly, Perfito’s company Sator was created with this goal of revolutionizing ownership in mind. Users generate the value of a show by watching it, Perfito argues. However, only centralized entertainment companies currently receive the payout from this user activity. Even if I binge watch the same episodes of ""Mad Men"" every year, I don’t receive any portion of the profit Amazon Prime makes by choosing to continue making it available. Sator’s platform rewards film and television viewers for watching their favorite content, which can then be staked to earn interest or traded for crypto or fiat currency. Sator even sets up virtual Movie Nights in the metaverse for wallet holders.  These new concepts of digital ownership are foundational pillars for the brave new Web 3 world, where all of our digital contributions may be logged on blockchain.  How do you make purchases in the metaverse?  Just like online shopping, you will access digital metaverse marketplaces through the internet. But rather than connecting to your accounts via a Google or Facebook sign-on, you’ll simply connect a digital wallet such as MetaMask. To buy stuff, you’ll need to keep enough compatible cryptocurrency in the wallet to cover the cost of the item plus applicable fees.  Read More: How to Set Up a MetaMask Wallet  Is the metaverse fun?  This depends on your definition of fun and what exactly you do in the metaverse, but many do find it fun.  Something about entering a virtual world with new people to meet, novel activities to engage in and fresh experiences to have creates opportunities for human connection, said Luca Arrigo, co-founder of Metaverse Architects, a 3D modeling and game development studio for metaverse worlds like Decentraland and The Sandbox.  “​​I believe there's a difference between my personality in my hometown and my personality outside of my country and online. You drop any preconceived notion of who you are and where you come from. We all grow up with different insecurities. I do think that when I go online, I can be more myself,” Arrigo said.  But just because the metaverse exists online doesn’t mean it has to stay that way. Most proponents of the metaverse emphasize that virtual worlds are meant to be a supplement and enhancement of our life “IRL” (in real life).  “I've met people at a conference,” Arrigo said. “And then we started meeting up in Decentraland.”  Read More: Decentraland for Beginners: How to Get Started in Decentraland  In one instance, Arrigo and a new friend went to Metaverse Fashion Week together and shared NFT wearables for their avatars.  “I honestly don't think everybody would appreciate an NFT wearable. But if you're already in Web 3 and you have your MetaMask and you want another NFT and you receive it as a gift … it really feels like you’re giving someone something,” Arrigo said.  And for Arrigo, who normally wears plain white T-shirts and jeans, dressing up an avatar in the metaverse is a form of fun self-expression.  “I'm not really a luxury brand kind of person. I don't feel like my identity is tied to real world objects. Yeah, well, ever since I started getting into the metaverse and experimenting with wearables, I'm going nuts for virtual fashion.”  How do I find things to actually do in the metaverse?  As for finding things to do, you might have to rely on word of mouth – at least for now.  “A big problem with the metaverse is that if you go on Google, and that's where we look for things to do online, right. And you search for metaverse, events, or you're going to find in person summits, meetups, conferences. And those are events about the metaverse while staying in real life in real life,” said Arrigo.  In some ways, argues Arrigo, taking a trip to the metaverse is just like visiting another country or another city. And it does need all of the same things that tourist destinations have, such as TripAdvisor and tour guides.  For now, exploring the Discord servers of a metaverse project and finding people in crypto Twitter who are excited about the metaverse and following them are two ways to find early signals of interesting things going on.

42421157,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXasCj,1653678718,Cardano’s Hoskinson: Luna Collapse Shows Need to Go Slow in Crypto,"For many observers, the collapse of LUNA and UST was an black eye for cryptocurrency. To Charles Hoskinson, it was a validation of his go-slow approach to developing a blockchain.  “If you move too quickly, as we’ve seen with Luna, and we’ve seen with $10.5 billion of hacks last year, you could actually get it to work until it doesn't, and then when it doesn’t it’s a catastrophic failure and everybody loses their money,” the Cardano founder said in a recent interview with CoinDesk.  Charles Hoskinson is a speaker at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  By contrast, he said, he and his company IOG (formerly IOHK) are moving deliberately in building the Cardano network, playing the “long arc game,” measured not in weeks or months, but in years to decades.  “We always say it’s not first, it’s best out of the gate” who succeeds, Hoskinson said. “The people who are going to survive are those who are tested under stress and exhibit resiliency.”  Hoskinson, who will speak at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, next month, has worked in the industry for nearly a decade – a lifetime in crypto years. A member of the founding Ethereum team, he famously had a falling-out with that blockchain’s creator, Vitalik Buterin.  Despite Hoskinson’s penchant for controversy and Cardano’s protracted development, the project is among the most closely watched in crypto, with ADA, the network’s native currency, commanding a $15.9 billion market cap as of Friday, the market’s eighth-largest.  Hoskinson readily acknowledged that Cardano’s development process is “a bit slower” than other projects. Indeed, Cardano gained the ability to run smart contracts only last year, four years after the network went live, trailing well behind Ethereum and other general-purpose blockchains.  This month, the unraveling of UST – a so-called algorithmic stablecoin designed to hold its value against the dollar without collateral – and its companion token LUNA rattled the global crypto markets. To Hoskinson, the debacle underscored the hazards of a “space where financial incentives and market setups are structured in a way of speed over quality.”  In the long term, Hoskinson said, the slower approach will win. Short-term oriented projects will “keep collapsing” and the market will eventually wise up.  Cardano in Ethiopia  In April of last year, IOG announced a partnership with the Ethiopian government to create a system based on blockchain technology to track the performance of students in local schools.  Read more: Cardano in Africa: Inside IOHK's Ethiopia Blockchain Deal  Asked for an update, Hoskinson said, “you take two steps forward, one step back.” In October, a new education minister succeeded the one who made the deal with IOG. The breakout of a civil war in Ethiopia the following month further complicated matters.  Fortunately for Cardano, IOG met with the new education minister “to make sure they signed a continuity with the arrangement we had under the prior minister,” Hoskinson said. “We got to a point where there’s now a systematic rollout. So, with any luck, we think about 1 to 2 million students should be in the system by the end of the year.”  All told, Hoskinson said, “It’s pretty extraordinary that despite all these struggles, it’s actually on track. The end goal is 5 million students. I think we’ll reach there sometime in 2023 at this current velocity.”  If that happens, he said, “it’s going be very straightforward to roll it out to another 15 million, and then it may be even possible to integrate these ideas into the ‘digital Ethiopia’ ideas that the prime minister wants to do by 2025.”  Blockchain and ESG  This month, Hoskinson attended the Milken Institute Global Conference, an annual gathering of muckety-mucks in Los Angeles, and picked up auspicious signals for blockchain builders.  Topic A was environmentally responsible business practices, known under the acronym ESG (environmental, social and governance).  “The No. 1 thing they were talking about was, how do we do the ESG part, from the oil companies’ perspective, from the battery-powered car company [perspective], from the government perspective?” Hoskinson said.  Talk of blockchains as a way to assess such companies’ ESG performance proliferated throughout the conference, he said, because the whole point of the technology is, “can we create some unified business standards amongst everybody, and then somehow put enforcement into that where you can audit, track and trace?”  (While Bitcoin’s energy-intensive mining process is often derided, fairly or not, as a big contributor to climate change, it is not the only way participants in a blockchain network can reach consensus on which set of records is true. For example, Cardano uses proof-of-stake, which requires less computing power and electricity than Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system, though whether it is as secure is a matter of debate.)  Moreover, Hoskinson said, “The most important [part of] ESG is the metadata and the identity component. You have to know who’s doing what, where and you have to have rich metadata about the facts and circumstances because then you could start talking about an audit regime, ESG scoring.”  Hoskinson, who donated $25 million last year to Carnegie Mellon University, said he could retire and live on a bison ranch in Wyoming but keeps at it because he wants to solve such societal problems.

The proposal to list on the NYSE Arca exchange lacks sufficient investor protections, the SEC said, which is similar verbiage used by the agency in denying other spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.  One River submitted paperwork for the ETF in May 2021, and the SEC in March announced a delay in its decision. This particular spot ETF application differed from others in that One River pledged to buy and dispose of carbon credits to account for the emissions associated with the bitcoin in the fund.  While the SEC has green-lit a number of futures-based bitcoin ETFs, it has denied (or otherwise delayed) all spot bitcoin ETFs brought before it. To name two, the agency in March denied applications submitted by NYDIG and GlobalX.  The most recent futures-based bitcoin ETF to win SEC approval was one from Valkyrie. That asset manager had filed its application under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Other approved bitcoin futures ETFs came under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

42423233,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XUFh,1653677389,Bitcoin Faces Resistance at $33K; Support at $22K-$25K,"Bitcoin (BTC) has traded below the $33,000 resistance level last week, although price action has stabilized within a tight range. That could point to an increase in volatility, similar to what occurred earlier this month.  BTC was down by about 3% over the past week and has outperformed most alternative cryptos, which suggests a lower appetite for risk among traders. Typically, in down markets, BTC declines less than alts because of its lower risk profile.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart is the most oversold since March 2020, which preceded a strong crypto rally. This time however, the deterioration in long-term momentum suggests limited upside in BTC.  There is growing risk of additional breakdowns in price because of negative momentum readings based on weekly and monthly price data. If a volatile down move occurs, initial support is seen at $25,000, which is around the May 9 price low. There is additional support at the 200-week moving average, currently at $22,061, which could stabilize price action.  A more conclusive downside target would be $17,673, which is roughly 78% of the prior uptrend from March 2020 to November 2021. That price level would also result in a roughly 73% peak-to-trough decline, which could signal capitulation.

42423244,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XUXh,1653677216,UK Crypto Hedge Fund Weathers Market Storm With Arbitrage Strategy,"A London-based cryptocurrency hedge fund is staying afloat despite the sharp downturn this year in the price of digital assets.  Nickel Digital Asset Management’s market-neutral arbitrage fund advanced about 0.5% in May, escaping the broader crypto and tech-related equity plunge. For the year, Nickel is down about 0.6%, versus bitcoin’s drop of about 40% and the tech-focused Nasdaq retreating about 24% over the same period. As of April 30, the cumulative performance of Nickel’s arbitrage fund since inception in June of 2019 reached just over 30%, net of all fees. The firm manages about $300 million.  Nickel’s CEO Anatoly Crachilov credits the positive performance to not taking directional views on the market, nor deploying long or short bets on crypto assets. Instead, the company mainly relies on cryptocurrency price dislocations. “What you’re really exploiting is dislocation between spot and derivative markets,” along with arbitrage across different crypto exchanges, Crachilov told CoinDesk.  Investors in the fund may not reap massive upside during a period of rising crypto prices, but their capital is protected during market corrections, Crachilov said. In a market rout, Nickel's main objective becomes protection of investors’ capital, hence the market-neutral arbitrage strategy.  ‘Volatility is our friend’  Typical market-neutral equity arbitrage funds tend to post around 8% annualized returns, according to Crachilov, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. He thinks crypto-focused funds can beat that figure near term, citing greater market dislocations. In the longer term as crypto markets become more efficient, Crachilov is guiding his clients to similar returns, in the 8%-10% range. Last year, Nickel’s arbitrage fund posted 15% returns.  Nickel’s arbitrage fund avoided Terra exposure, though in a bright spot for the industry, Crachilov says that derivative markets remained “very orderly” during Terra’s collapse. He cited most exchanges remaining open for trading, whereas in previous years, there was more systemic risk for crypto assets and exchanges. The ecosystem has improved, he added.  With respect to overall crypto sector volatility, Crachilov and Nickel’s team of former Wall Street and hedge fund professionals are embracing it.  “Volatility is our friend,” he said. “When people complain crypto is way too volatile – from my perspective – it's not as volatile as I would like,” Crachilov told CoinDesk.  It remains a choppy environment for crypto participants, as Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz pointed out in a tweet on Friday.  “Crypto trades poorly,” Novogratz wrote. “This is going to be a period that tests people's convictions. We will find a bottom when we do. The break from trad-fi markets is because we don’t have corporate buybacks and giant pension rebalancing that is causing this squeeze in equities.”  Read more: Crypto Hedge Fund Elwood Closes $70M Funding Led by Goldman Sachs and Dawn Capital  UPDATE (May 27, 2022, 21:07 UTC): Updates to include May performance and photo.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/27/uk-crypto-hedge-fund-weathers-market-storm-with-arbitrage-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3f34c2970c3dc4b78e08f9e653b36a98a990742-1500x786.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421583,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeY1,1653675529,Nansen Research Debunks Single 'Attacker' Myth in Terra's Collapse,"​​Friday morning, on-chain analytics firm Nansen released its in-depth report on the trading activity that led to the depegging of the stablecoin terraUSD (UST). There is an immense amount of detail to be unpacked, but Nansen’s most important conclusion is this:  “We refute the popular narrative of one ‘attacker’ or ‘hacker’ working to destabilize UST. The depeg of UST could instead have resulted from the investment decisions of several well-funded entities, e.g., to abide by risk management constraints or alternative to reduce UST allocations deposited into [lending protocol] Anchor in the context of turbulent macroeconomic and market conditions.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  To put that in English, Nansen concludes that terraUSD lost its one-to-one peg to the U.S. dollar because a variety of large holders felt it was too risky to keep holding the tokens. So they sold them.  Nansen identified seven wallets that were putting big selling pressure on the token, and it believes they all belong to separate actors. Nansen says one of the seven, for instance, is part of the Celsius network.  Nansen found that from May 7-11, these “whales” independently began aggressively trading their UST for USDC or other assets through the Curve liquidity pool, where Nansen said the depeg originated. (Curve is a decentralized token exchange on Ethereum.)  The Luna Foundation Guard tried to defend the peg by buying all that UST, but whales dumped so much LFG couldn’t keep up. That is, the nonprofit founded to protect UST’s $1 valuation didn't deploy enough assets to soak up all that UST. At that point, the peg started to waver as worried UST holders decided it was worth it to take 97 or 98 cents on the dollar.  From there it was all over but the shouting, because UST’s Rube Goldberg-like perpetual motion machine made it profitable to arbitrage this price imbalance in a way that widened it further. That led to a “death spiral” for UST and caused LUNA – its related “balancer token” – to hyperinflate, ultimately leaving few buyers for either.  There’s a lot more to say about the back-end nuances, but the big picture is what matters here: At the end of the day, UST collapsed because several large holders independently decided it was too risky. This shouldn’t be surprising, because after the terraUSD collapse insiders like Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX have suggested the smart money knew the token “was transparently going to falter at some point,” and were poised to bolt when waters got choppy.  And why was the smart money so primed to run for the exits? Because they looked at the fundamental structure of LUNA and UST and saw something that could never work. Any other understanding of events is pure and simple deflection – what the kids these days call “cope.”  As I wrote last week, the idea that a single malicious “attacker” or some shadowy cabal had intentionally knocked UST off its kilter basically amounts to a defense of terrible network design, implying that things would have been fine if it weren’t for the powerful enemies of the Luna(tic) Revolution. But the Nansen report shows that for the delusion it is: UST collapsed because there wasn’t enough market faith in the algorithmic stablecoin’s design and team, and that’s that.  See also: UST's Do Kwon and the Human Cost of Lunatic Hubris | Opinion  This morning, I belatedly discovered one of the most absurd pieces of UST conspiracy cope yet, one that nicely sums up the motivated thinking behind the “attack” narrative. BitBoy, a particularly suspect YouTube crypto “influencer” who has been credibly accused of taking “pay to play” payments to promote tokens, confidently declared last week that the U.S. government is “100% behind the UST depeg.”  Whether he’s self-aware about it or not, BitBoy here is delivering the perfect line to cover his own ass as a Terra promoter (LUNA’s “pump cannot be stopped,” he declared in December), as well as covering for Do Kwon and his investors. Because, boy, if the U.S. government was behind the attack, then surely there wasn’t a problem with the UST design or the team. In fact – My God! – wouldn’t that suggest LUNA/UST were so perfect and powerful that the government was desperate to strangle it in its crib?  This is the kind of lazy, fact-free conspiracy thinking that’s rotting all of our brains and lets grifters get away with stealing your money. In this case it’s particularly devilish because we’re about to see the launch of “Luna 2.0,” which skeptics have said could just be another chance for Do Kwon and his allies to work over the same people they got the first time around.  See also: Do Kwon Is the Elizabeth Holmes of Crypto | Opinion  The truth is that LUNA and terraUSD collapsed, at best, because they were built on a fundamentally flawed economic mechanism that incentivized its own collapse the moment faith wavered even slightly.

42423242,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XUTh,1653674543,Siam Commercial Bank Is Chasing DeFi Yield Through Compound,"Bangkok-headquartered Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), the oldest and one of the biggest banks in Thailand, has entered the decentralized finance (DeFi) realm via Compound Treasury, the lending platform’s institution-focused service.  The digital venture arm of the bank, a subsidiary called SCB 10X that was launched at the beginning of 2020, will deposit funds into Compound Treasury, a kind of institutional wrapper that leverages custody firm Fireblocks, the companies said.  The service converts U.S. dollars into fiat-backed USDC on Compound, which allows institutions to earn fixed annual yields of 4%. The size of SCB 10x’s allocation into Compound Treasury was not disclosed. An S&P Global rating of the platform earlier this month revealed that the platform had “only 20 customers and $180 million invested at the end of April.”  Read more: Compound’s Enterprise Arm Receives S&P Credit Rating in DeFi First  Large institutions including banks have been eyeing the DeFi space, with services like Compound Treasury and Aave Arc offering a serviceable entry point.  SCB 10X has been an avid VC investor in crypto and is also involved in building infrastructure in the space. The bank’s digital division has been ironing out how to actually take part in DeFi since July of last year, explained Mukaya Tai Panich, chief investment officer at SCB 10X.  “Not only are we an investor and a builder, we also wanted to adopt these types of disruptive technology to use, especially to use inside a bank,” said Panich in an interview. “We think Compound has created a regulated instrument that’s very easy to understand: U.S. dollar in, U.S. dollar out with a fixed 4% interest rate, so institutions don’t have to worry about how to interact with crypto.”  SCB DeFi  It was a heavy lift getting the board of SCB, as well as the bank’s rather risk-averse treasury management team, confident enough to participate in DeFi, Panich said.  One wrinkle, she said, concerned the question of principal guarantee (when a fixed-income security guarantees a minimum return equal to the investor’s initial investment, regardless of the performance of the underlying assets).  Panich, who had gotten to know Compound CEO Robert Leshner in recent years (SBC 10X has hosted a couple of virtual DeFi conferences), was able to get a dialogue going to try and meet the bank’s requirements.  “We talked to Compound about the ‘principal back’ guarantee, that it was a request from our treasury team. At the beginning Compound didn’t offer that. But, lo and behold, after many months they offered a ‘principal back’ guarantee,” she said.  A security and compliance layer was provided by crypto custody firm Fireblocks, which also facilitates the whitelisted Aave Arc DeFi service for institutions, and has been working with Compound Treasury since late last year.  “We are seeing more high-end institutional clients tapping into the DeFi,” Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said in an interview. “We believe things like Compound Treasury and Aave Arc are definitely stepping stones to make them comfortable with DeFi, and SCB has always been on the forefront of innovation so we were happy to see them moving forward.”  Compound interest  Compound Treasury is not a permissioned lending pool per se, like Aave Arc, said Shaulov. Rather, it’s an operational layer that on-ramps USDC into the permissionless Compound protocol, which is monitored by analytics software to ensure nothing malicious happens in the lending pools, he said.  SCB’s Panich said this is clearly an important step within institutional DeFi, but the mood has damped of late, particularly by the collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin and lending protocol Anchor. (SCB 10X invested in Anchor’s seed round.)  “It’s very unfortunate that this whole thing happened,” said Panich. “But the education of regulators, board members and the people at the top level of management got accelerated by several years. So, I guess that's a silver lining.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMP | FIAT | REGULATION | ZRX,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/27/siam-commercial-bank-is-chasing-defi-yield-through-compound,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29979f61f304f93c5e5abd3277706a0dc288521c-5600x3732.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421574,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeTt,1653673424,What Happens if You’re Sexually Assaulted in the Metaverse?,"Does your avatar in the metaverse have the same rights and legal protections as you do?  Virtual worlds are being built to mirror the physical world. You can attend concerts, visit casinos, meet a friend for coffee and even hang out in a lounge sponsored by your bank. When it comes to regulation though, real-world law is not mirrored, instead these digital spaces are governed by code and terms of service agreements, leaving some asking, is this enough?  While regulators struggle to understand what their jurisdiction might be in the metaverse and how existing laws apply to digital assets, land, data and privacy - civil and criminal laws that apply to interpersonal interactions are often left out of the conversation.  Jenn Senasie is a co-host on CoinDesk's ""The Hash,"" a daily news show that unpacks the latest developments in tech, cryptocurrency and finance. This article is part of “Metaverse Week.""  This is all the more important considering the metaverse’s promised role to become a large part of how we interact in the future. Regulators will battle with this question as the metaverse gains momentum, and as real people suffer real consequences and injuries in these virtual spaces.  And the harms are real:  “Within 60 seconds of joining – I was verbally and sexually harassed,"" Nina Jane Patel wrote in a Medium article that chronicled a “virtual gang rape” she experienced in Meta’s Horizon Venues, which is now part of the Horizon Worlds platform.  “As I tried to get away they yelled – ‘don’t pretend you didn’t love it’ and ‘go rub yourself off to the photo,’” the 43-year-old mother wrote as she described the experience as a surreal nightmare.  This was not an isolated incident. In December 2021, a Horizon Worlds beta tester said she was groped. She wrote on the official Horizons Facebook page, “Not only was I groped last night, but there were other people there who supported this behavior which made me feel isolated in the Plaza.”  If human interaction in the real world has taught us anything, it’s that we can expect to hear more stories like this. The National Sexual Violence Resource Center, an American nonprofit, found that 81% of women and 43% of men have reported experiencing some sort of sexual violence or assault in their lives.  So what happens when you’re sexually assaulted in the metaverse?  In the case of Patel and the beta user, Meta launched a solution called Personal Boundary for Horizon Worlds. The feature, which was announced in a blog post, prevents others from entering your avatar’s personal space, “making it easier to avoid unwanted interactions.”  See also: What Happens When You Die in the Metaverse? | Opinion  Fixes like this present their own challenges. The personal boundary feature released by Meta remains turned on by default for “non-friends,” and users can adjust their Personal Boundary settings as they please. But what happens if a user turns off their boundary and is sexually assaulted? Is this the user’s fault? What happens if a person isn’t tech savvy enough to navigate the settings? This feels like the virtual version of telling a woman she was assaulted because her clothes were too revealing.  At what point is the person behind an avatar legally responsible for their own actions?  The U.S. Code’s definition of rape includes committing a sexual act on another person by:  Using unlawful force against that other person.  Using force causing or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to any person.  Threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected to death, grievous bodily harm, or kidnapping.  While avatars can’t suffer “grievous bodily harm,” people can suffer psychological damage. Although people can be awarded damages for psychological harm – it isn’t yet specifically outlined in the legal definition mentioned above, nor is it clear how the metaverse mediates mental harm.  A new definition?  Patel described her experience as one so horrible she couldn’t think, she couldn’t put the safety barrier in place, she just froze. It was only after this experience that Meta created the safety barrier that is turned on by default.  Those that experience this type of harm in virtual worlds often feel isolated, just like the Horizon Worlds beta user noted in her Facebook post.  The metaverse isn’t the first instance we’ve seen of virtual assault and harassment leading to feelings of isolation and helplessness. Social media created a world where we became comfortable interacting with each other from behind screens, making it easier for harassment to occur.  With the rise of social media came the rise of cyberbullying and cyber assault, but not specific cyber laws for interpersonal harm.  In 2013, 17-year-old Canadian high school student Rehtaeh Parsons committed suicide, leaving her community in shock. Parsons struggled with mental health issues after photos of her alleged gang rape surfaced online.  Nova Scotia’s government passed the Intimate Images and Cyber-protection Act to “deter, prevent and respond to the harms of non-consensual sharing of intimate images and cyber-bullying,” and offered a path to receive civil remedies.  In this situation the law was reactive. Could Parsons’ life have been saved if the legal system was able to keep up with technology?  Lawmakers have the opportunity to learn from the past and be proactive when it comes to user interaction in the metaverse. If avatars are representative of real world people, real world protections should be put in place to protect the psychological safety of every person.  See also: Using Crypto to Bring the Metaverse Into Reality | Opinion  It is naive to think that the darkest parts of the physical world won’t be mirrored in the virtual world. The impacts are bigger than just breaking a company’s terms of service, and it’s not clear that by enabling new types of experiences, the companies or platforms will share the legal burden if things go wrong.  You might find yourself accessing the metaverse from the safety of your own home, but you could be entering one of the most unsafe situations you’ve ever experienced. How’s that for meta?

However, the basis for disregarding spot ETF vs futures ETF approval presents several talking points. Let us take a look at a few issues: How do Crypto Futures and Spot ETFs Differ? The futures ETFs involve investors betting on the crypto futures where the price movements of the underlying assets determine the trade outcomes. The trade relies on futures contracts which stipulate the period when the investors must sell or acquire particular crypto asset classes. The crypto futures investment involves buying futures contracts and selling when the terms prove true at a later date for profit or selling at a loss. What is Spot ETF? The spot ETFs involve investing in derivatives that depend on the actual market values of the underlying crypto assets.

42421570,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeQn,1653670699,Happiness 3.0: A Mission for Mental Health in the Metaverse,"A recent study highlighted what many have known to be true since ""swipes,"" ""likes"" and ""reels"" began to dominate our attention: Social media and the web can aggravate mental health problems, especially in young people.  The latest research echoes the findings of a 2020 National Library of Medicine report, which noted a ""70% increase in self-reported depressive symptoms among the group using social media."" A study in the New York Times broadened the scope.  Maurice Fadida is the founder of Seeds of Happiness, a new NFT project in partnership with Dapper Labs. This article is part of “Metaverse Week.""  “Social media may have an indirect effect on happiness by displacing other activities, like in-person interactions, exercise or sleep that are crucial for mental and physical health,” that report found.  The stress and salvation of being social  Anyone who has frequented the endless content feeds of social media platforms has likely experienced moments of heightened stress, screen addiction and increased anxiety. Some of these concerns are meta, like worrying about living too much of your life online.  But is the internet all bad?  Of course not! From the dawn of the web to today it has brought countless movements, industries, people, ideas and technologies together. It fostered a sense of global connectedness in the worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic – (bless you, Stanley Tucci). We owe the internet much praise; even in such complicated times.  Read more: How to Make It in the Metaverse  That said, what it means to be human is changing rapidly – largely because of technological innovation. And, for better or worse, it seems like we’re standing on the edge of another tech-driven paradigm shift with the rise of the metaverse.  At its core, the metaverse strives to offer more opportunity, stronger communities, less surveillance, and ultimately, more freedom. This is similar to how non-fungible tokens (NFT) and Web 3 leverage the power of decentralization to break down digital barriers and challenge gatekeepers.  But if the metaverse is to provide salvation for the trials and tribulations of the internet as we know it (Web 2), should we not also be concerned? Social media both increases anxiety and happiness – is that true too for another, heightened form of the internet that promises not just social experiences but life-like ones?  How do we not repeat the same mistakes when diving headfirst into a brave new digital world?  First, we must remember: Too much of anything can be unhealthy, whether it's time online or, for example, in the gym. In a digital space where avatars roam free and reality is skewed, it's always important to take some time to unplug.  Last month, an article from the New York Post highlighted both sides of the spectrum, noting that spending too much time in a digital environment can ""negatively impact our ability to engage in non-virtual life.""  The article also quoted a psychology professor at the University of Oregon, who theorized that ""a young person who may be LGBT and who finds an online context where they can feel a sense of social support – we would predict that that would be a benefit for their mental health.""  Read more: How to Prevent the Metaverse From Becoming a Nightmare  Like anything, balance is key, and the pendulum can swing both ways. As someone who has devoted a career to supporting builders in the metaverse and NFTs, I believe we must promote this balance in the healthiest – and happiest – manner that we can.  Happiness, on-chain  Even amid market volatility, NFT sales continue even among those who knew little to nothing of this three-lettered acronym a mere two years ago. That’s often because NFTs are about more than financial gain, but about creating community.  NFT projects and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) have changed lives, broken records and supported crucial global causes. Previously below-the-radar artists have been able to make headlines, and new communities have been forged through on Discord and IRL at global conferences.  New social circles have applied Web 3 principles to the idea of collective experience and participation. But while this positive outlook has permeated the blockchain in many ways, so has the negative. We’re talking: rug pulls, market hysteria, bad actors, hacks, haters, dodgy decisions, stress, pressure and Twitter addiction.  At this critical time for the future of Web 3, NFTs and the metaverse, how do we ensure a happy and healthy future for us all? Well, there are both tech and social solutions:  Mental health-centric ethos in NFTs: We need more NFT projects to promote better mental health at their core – from their founders to their roadmap to their sale. From musical virtual reality experiences to psychedelics, great work is already being done across the industry. Let’s not stop.  Community incentives and utility: Let's reward holders for promoting mental health and wellness-focused IRL experiences (parties are great, but in-person events and experiences can offer much more). Let’s bring more positivity to the physical potential of NFTs and the metaverse.  Mental-health-focused metaverse experiences: There's still a lot of (sensitive) work to be done here, but I believe we can help people find the health and happiness they need in digital worlds if done correctly. Let’s bring more mental health experts into the space and learn from them.  More education and discussion: It's time to get real about the potential mental health (and physical health) issues surrounding the metaverse and NFTs to come up with productive solutions. Sharing is caring.  Establish clear community values and guidelines in NFT and metaverse projects: If health and happiness are part of your mission (as they should be), lead by example, and start from the top.

42423248,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XUdh,1653668282,"First Mover Americas: Ether Ends May 35% Down, Altcoins Lose Out","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Ether is ending May down 35% as investors look to safer risk profile investments.  Market Moves: Decreasing NFT interest causes the amount of volume traded on Ethereum to drop significantly.  Feature: Stepn gets banned in China, sending its GMT token spiraling.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was down 1% over the last 24 hours, trading at around $28,850. BTC was headed for a ninth-straight weekly decline, its longest-ever losing streak, based on pricing data going back to 2011.  Ether is down 10% on the day, trading around $1,700. Ether opened the month trading at $2,800 and has dropped 64% since. Bitcoin, by comparison, has dropped by 23% in May.  Other altcoins also slid, with Avalanche's AVAX dipping 10%, Solana's SOL by 7% and NEAR by 7%.  As altcoins continue to suffer and bitcoin dominance rises (currently at 46%), traders are seeing bitcoin as a “safer risk profile relative to altcoins,” said Sean Farrell in Fundstrat’s crypto weekly note.  In traditional markets, stock futures edged higher on Friday. The S&P 500 futures rose slightly. Bitcoin has largely followed the S&P 500 downwards this year – but it appears the recent rally hasn’t helped the crypto market.  Market Moves  On-chain metrics  Activity on Ethereum has been declining. Ethereum’s transaction volume is down by 80%, which is one-fifth of what it was a year ago, according to data from IntoTheBlock.  According to IntoTheBlock, activity on Ethereum and most smart contract platforms have suffered from the decreasing interest in NFTs, or non-fungible tokens.  “As large NFT sales have become less common and there is lower demand for blockchains, the amount of volume traded on Ethereum has been decreasing,” said IntoTheBlock’s head of research, Lucas Outumuro.  “Decreasing NFT interest along with lower yields in DeFi have led to volumes dropping significantly.”  NFTs managed to appreciate in the first quarter of 2021 in contrast to other assets, but the recent decline has caused a knock on effect on activity on the Ethereum network.  The takeaway for ether here is that in the near term there becomes less demand for it as this is the main currency used to purchase NFTs.  “It also means that less ether is getting burned since NFT drops used to be the largest source,” said Outumuro.  In the money, out of the money  The percentage of addresses profiting from their ether positions also dropped to the lowest point since July 2020 according to data from IntoTheBlock.  A metric used to see whether investors are profiting or losing out from their investments, labeled In/Out of the Money (IOM), identifies the average price at which the tokens were bought and compares it to the current price. If the current price is greater than the average cost, the investor is “in the money,” if current price < average cost, the address is “out of the money.”  Currently, 55% of the addresses currently holding ether are “in the money,” and 43% are “out of the money.”  The metric shows when prices were at similar levels and compares the percentage making profits and gets an idea of whether more/less investors are profiting.  “​​The IOM around price is helpful to determine price ranges where buying activity has been concentrated, showing an on-chain equivalent of support and resistance levels,” said Outumuro.  Matthew Dibb attributes altcoins’ recent price action to rotation from major crypto and altcoins to BTC. This trend looks set to continue if market weakness persists, with the BTC dominance index breaking out to multi-month highs.  “Speculators are moving exposure from altcoins to bitcoins in search of a more stable asset to hold throughout market volatility,” said Dibb in a conversation with CoinDesk.  Latest Headlines  New Terra Blockchain Expected to Launch on Saturday, LUNA Airdrop to Follow The move is part of a broader plan to help revive the Terra ecosystem and its related tokens.  Ether Accounts for Almost Half of $520M Liquidations Amid Weak On-Chain Data Traders of ether futures saw liquidations nearly double those of bitcoin in an unusual move.

Feature: Stepn to Bar Gameplay in China, Sending 'Move-to-Earn' Token GMT Spiraling  By Cameron Thompson  Solana-based “move-to-earn” game Stepn will effectively bar gameplay in China in mid-July, the company announced Thursday, sending its GMT token spiraling as the markets digested the news.  Stepn said it will stop providing GPS services to users whose IP address or GPS location shows them in China on July 15. Without GPS services, players who own its membership-like shoe non-fungible token (NFT) will not be able to earn tokens for their steps.  The price of GMT was down 38% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Stepn NFT shoes were trading around 8.5 SOL on Magic Eden at press time, 3.5 SOL below Wednesday's price.  Stepn “has always attached great importance to compliance obligations and always strictly abides by the relevant requirements of local regulatory agencies,” the company said in a tweet, without citing a specific policy. It further stated that Stepn has never engaged in business in China.  China’s crypto regulatory landscape is vague, however, and Chinese banking associations' scrutiny of NFTs has been on the rise. Considering users need to purchase NFT sneakers to participate in the game, Stepn could be the next target for a crackdown.  Stepn did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

42423237,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XUNh,1653667515,The Crypto Community Says the UK's FCA Is Finally Starting to Listen,"The Financial Conduct Authority, which is known for being critical of digital assets, took a different tack in its first CryptoSprint, held earlier this month.  Over the course of two days, participants worked in mixed-discipline teams to explore the challenges facing the crypto industry, including how the FCA, the U.K.’s financial regulator, can support and balance innovation with standards that protect consumers, the FCA said on its website.  The CryptoSprint explored how to handle disclosing information related to the issuance of crypto assets, regulatory obligations and custody regulations. Many digital asset company executives told CoinDesk they wanted a collaborative approach that allowed for innovation. The FCA's CryptoSprint made some of its attendees feel like that was actually possible.  Read more: The FCA Is Holding Its First CryptoSprint: Here’s What the Digital Asset Community Wants From It  “I think the way that the FCA has engaged with the industry at this early stage is a great thing, because it's a sign that they're listening so hopefully we can actually get regulations that fit the industry,” said Michael Johnson, head of compliance at U.K.-based crypto wallet provider Zumo.  The FCA  The FCA echoed the enthusiasm.  “The last two days have been hugely positive, with participants collaborating closely on what future policy might look like,"" an FCA spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement. ""It was striking that the general view on future regulation for the crypto market matches ours, with consumer protection and market integrity key to providing confidence in this evolving sector.”  At the CryptoSprint, the FCA heard from a range of players within the digital asset sector including chief executives, compliance heads, academics and lawyers, Johnson told CoinDesk. The event had more than 600 applications and 96 attendees in addition to the FCA staff facilitating the event, Johnson said.  FCA Chief Executive Nikhil Rathi; the head of banking at HM Treasury, David Raw; and Jessica Rusu, the FCA’s chief data, information and intelligence officer, were all at the event, said Ian Taylor, a member of Crypto UK, a local trade organization. These attendees showed that the FCA was taking the event seriously, Taylor said.  The crypto experts attending the event had to organize problem statements, discussing issues the regulator was exploring, into themes and explore them before presenting on different topics. FCA employees were positioned to take notes.  Global approach  International companies attended, including a representative from the San Francisco-based Kraken exchange.  “It was reassuring to participate in well-formed, open and frank policy discussions with the FCA,” Curtis Ting, Kraken's managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said. “We were particularly encouraged by the CryptoSprint’s foundational acknowledgement that offshore firms remaining unaccountable to U.K. regulations pose a challenge to the U.K.’s ambition to become a world-class fintech hub.”  Participants agreed that a global effort to coordinate regulation worldwide would help the digital asset sector mature and grow in terms of adoption, Sabrina Wilson, chief operating officer at Copper, a custody solution provider on the FCA's temporary registration regime, said in a statement.  According to CryptoUK’s Taylor, roughly half those attending the CryptoSprint believe the regulator has not listened to the industry in the past. However, that does not mean it will continue to ignore cryptocurrency representatives now.  The remainder of those attending believe the FCA’s move was positive, Taylor said.  “Personally, I can only go by my past experience. The FCA hasn't really been listening to the industry. However, the main positive is, they're willing to learn,” Taylor said.  The FCA set up a temporary registration regime (TRR) to allow crypto companies without full registration to continue to operate as its licensing regime took effect. Over 100 companies applied for registration, but there are currently only five companies on the TRR list, while 34 have full authorization.  The registration regime from the anti-money laundering perspective has been difficult on the industry, Zumo’s Johnson said.  “If we're going to protect U.K. customers, how can we encourage people to be regulated within the U.K. so they can more fully meet their own objectives?” Johnson said.  What the industry wants  The U.K. announced in April that it will be working on a new crypto regulatory package and has plans to regulate stablecoins. The U.K. already has a manual on how the HM Revenue and Customs, the government's tax arm, will tax crypto.  Read more: UK Crypto Industry Hopes for More Clarity From Planned Stablecoin Rules  Having a self-regulatory organization, where a trade body is given powers to regulate and manage the industry was a “common narrative” among industry participants but the FCA did not have any appetite for this, Taylor said.  There was an interest for incremental regulation, Johnson said.  “If you do it in piecemeal sized chunks, it means that the industry can actually manage those chunks and keep moving fluidly,” Johnson said.

The Second U.S. NFT Property Is Ready For Auction Propy disclosed that its second U.S. NFT-backed property would auction at a starting price of 185,000 USDC. USDC is a stable coin backed by the United States Dollar. The transaction will be similar to Propy&apos;s previous NFT real estate sale. This is because there will be a transfer of property ownership to an LLC created by Propy. The record of ownership of the LLC will be on the blockchain as an NFT. The NFT will then auction on Propy&apos;s Marketplace. Also, the owner of this NFT, stored on the blockchain, will have full ownership of the LLC that owns the subject property. Can Big-Time Investors Place Winning Bids? Yes, they can. Participants and investors must complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) form to participate in the auction. The KYC form is an essential step from both a regulatory and a practical standpoint. It helps Propy combat criminality in the financial sector and money laundering.

42421577,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoeSr,1653663931,We Need to Talk About Exchanges That Sell You Coins Like UST,"Happy Friday readers, David Z. Morris is filling in for Michael Casey today.  CoinDesk Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds alerted me this week to a striking Linkedin post by a Coinbase (COIN) staffer. In the post, apparently now deleted, the Coinbaser wrote in part that it’s “crazy to me how much market value sits in these (probably) useless projects,” before listing a half-dozen tokens including dogecoin (DOGE), bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum classic (ETC), shiba inu (SHIB), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin SV (BSV) and bitcoin gold (BTG).  Now, plenty of people would take issue with the idea that bitcoin cash, ethereum classic or even dogecoin are “useless.” But broadly, such sentiments wouldn’t sound out of place coming from any random account on Crypto Twitter.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The catch, of course, is that here they’re coming from a Coinbase staffer – and Coinbase makes money from the trading of “useless” bitcoin cash, ethereum classic, dogecoin, shiba inu, and Litecoin.  To be clear, I think it reflects both good morals and good strategy that Coinbase staffers are opinionated on social media. In this industry, it’s a crucial way to keep up to date and test ideas. Employees putting their critical thinking skills on display is also good branding.  But the post raised a much larger point: Do crypto exchanges like Coinbase have a responsibility to customers when they choose what tokens they offer for sale? Should exchanges warn customers about projects or tokens regarded as questionable by their own staff? Or is an exchange’s role more neutral, simply listing tokens and letting customers make their own choices?  That’s a particularly pressing question in the wake of the collapse of the Luna ecosystem with the depegging of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin. There have been unsubstantiated Twitter rumors of a class action lawsuit that would target exchanges that sold the LUNA or UST tokens. That group includes many centralized custodial exchanges around the world and several in the U.S., including Kraken, Binance US, and Gemini.  Coinbase didn’t sell LUNA directly, but did offer the UST stablecoin as well as “wrapped LUNA” (wLUNA) bridged to Ethereum (for, I’m sure, perfectly sound reasons). Very much to its credit, Coinbase also does not offer trading in bitcoin SV, bitcoin gold, or dogelon mars (ELON), the other tokens the Coinbase staffer called out.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Let Terra Die  You might not think it makes much sense to sue an exchange for selling you a token that collapses – as I’ll say once more for those in the back, any cryptocurrency at all is a hugely speculative investment, and this could all go to zero tomorrow. But exchanges spent much of the past two years making Super Bowl ads promising that crypto is the future, so you can at least empathize with someone who feels ripped off.  You might expect there to be a bright-line legal or regulatory answer to this question, but it’s actually somewhat unclear. That’s partly because many of the crypto assets Coinbase offers are in a gray zone relative to securities law. So a lot of the rules regarding the responsibilities of financial intermediaries for stocks, for instance, wouldn’t straightforwardly apply to an entity performing the same role for crypto-assets.  Still, without claiming any rigorous legal implications, related securities rules are interesting to consider. For instance, it’s well known by now (I hope) that a securities broker does not have a fiduciary duty to buyers of securities. Brokers represent themselves or their broker company’s interests, not yours. A certified financial advisor (CFA) is legally supposed to be in your corner, but not a broker.  However, brokers do have a lighter duty to customers. FINRA rules say that any recommendations made by a broker must be broadly “suitable,” based largely on the customer’s risk profile. Again, this applies explicitly to securities, and the status of tokens on Coinbase is largely indeterminate, but it certainly seems like a reasonable standard.  There is a further crypto complexity to all this. I’ve been talking about brokers while Coinbase is best known not as a “broker” but as an “exchange.” Because crypto is so retail-centric, exchanges are often effectively also brokers, selling assets directly to customers.  It’s also clear that crypto exchanges have long been regarded in some sense as arbiters of project quality. It’s less true now, but for many years a token earning a listing on any exchange would celebrate it as validation. A Coinbase listing in particular almost always generated a “Coinbase bump,” or a price runup after listing.  It’s a stretch, but that certainly makes a listing sound a little bit like a broker’s “recommendation.” At least, that’s an argument a plaintiff might make in a consumer protection case. Exchanges also regularly do things like write explainer blog posts about specific tokens, or about technological concepts linked to tokens. Are those “recommendations?” (This may be one reason the Nasdaq website runs third-party news content instead of just publishing promotional materials about stocks.)  Read more: Daniel Kuhn - UST Won't Be the End of Algorithmic Stablecoins  Because of this ambiguity, crypto exchanges are perhaps uniquely exposed to customer anger over losses. It’s hard to imagine someone wanting to, say, sue the Nasdaq because Netflix (NFLX) collapsed by 75% (though now that I’ve written it, I’m certain someone will). Partly that’s because nobody buys Netflix stock from the Nasdaq, but through Fidelity or another broker. But if you bought UST in April and then watched it evaporate, you know it’s Coinbase or Kraken that have your money today.  And now we get back to the FINRA broker rules. A broker/dealer does not have a fiduciary duty to customers but must meet a lighter standard of “suitability,” a general matching of risk profile to a customer. For crypto exchanges, this seems close to a reasonable standard for responsible behavior, whenever the U.S. Congress gets around to writing some of those down.  But the case of UST would seem to challenge even this lighter standard. Can any asset be considered “suitable” for even the most frothing risk taker when any monetary finance expert could have confidently predicted its failure? When it’s the fifth version of the same experiment to fail exactly as predicted?  How about when an exchange’s landing page for a token uncritically echoes the creators’ false claims – for instance, that it’s “stable”? Or how about when the venture arm of the exchange invested in the group behind the token the exchange profited from trading before it went to zero?  Well, then you have what in the legal profession is known as an “ethical morass.” It’s just the sort of thing courts specialize in untangling.",NEUTRAL,BCH | ETC | LUNA | SHIB,BCH | ETC | EXCHANGE | LUNA | SHIB,David Z.

The addition of USDT, which is tied 1:1 to the dollar and has a market cap of over $73 billion, will help support Polygon's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by providing a stable currency for investors to generate yield and move in and out of the network.  Polygon is a layer 2 scaling solution that runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain to provide faster transactions and lower fees. There are more than 19,000 decentralized applications (dapps) running on the network, six times more than in October, Alchemy data shows.  Polygon has so far processed over 1.6 billion total transactions, with over a 142 million unique user addresses, and has more than $5 billion in locked value.  “We’re excited to launch USDT on Polygon, offering its community access to the most liquid, stable and trusted stablecoin in the digital token space,” said Paolo Ardoino, Tether's chief technology officer.

If you analyze the BNB on smaller timeframes, you may not notice this consolidation. The current local trend of falling has just stopped at its lower limit near $230. This mark withstood the blows of sellers in May 2021. Then high trading volumes during the weekly candle of 17 May were completely stopped in the range of $230. Analyzing the trading week on 9 May, we see that the desire to keep the mark of $230 is still there. The weekly candle closed with a big pin down and the next two trading weeks without aggression slowly lowered the price of BNB. https://www.tradingview.com/x/TlThjXC7/ BNB cryptocurrency is one of the few tokens that is doing well in the current fall of the cryptocurrency market.

Holders of LUNA and terraUSD (UST), a U.S.-dollar pegged stablecoin, are eligible to receive new LUNA tokens in a vested manner based on their previous holdings. This would, in theory, allow old holders to regain some of their lost investment value while incentivizing usage of the new blockchain.  For example, wallets with more than 1 million LUNA or UST prior to UST’s depegging from the U.S. dollar would have to wait more than a year before receiving any tokens, with a four-year vesting period thereafter. New tokens will be automatically distributed to existing user wallets.  Popular applications from the current blockchain – which will continue as ""Terra Classic"" after the launch of Terra 2.0 – are expected to migrate to the new blockchain.  Separately, a governance vote on Terra’s proposal 1747 to burn 1.388 billion UST passed on Thursday. The move reduced UST’s supply by some 11% of its current supply of 11.28 billion.  Terra’s UST tokens saw a bank run earlier this month that caused prices of the tokens to fall to as low as 7 cents.

Many miners, he claimed, would prefer to use it over carbon energy. &apos;They can get a lot of taxes and good jobs out of this, and all they have done is to scare the capital away.&apos; The Canadian entrepreneur used his own experience to support his position, stating that he had redirected capital that would have otherwise gone from New York to Norway.

Will the breakdown crack the $15 base? Key technical points: The KCS market value reduced by 4.15% in the last 24 hours. The inverted rounding bottom pattern has a neckline at $15. The 24-hour trading volume of Kucoin is $8.60 Million, indicating a rise of 38.7%. Past Performance of KCS The bearish trend continues to lower the KCS market value in an arc of inverted rounding bottom, beginning with the rejection of $17. The negative retracement explains the loss of 12% and warns of the psychological barrier to falling below $15. At present, the price action is forming a lower price rejection close to the neckline that could be breached if selling pressure increases. Source-Tradingview KCS Technical Analysis KCS price is struggling to stay above the neckline of $15 despite the bullish attempts observed in multiple candles. As a result, the price action displays an intense selling pressure, catalyzing the inverted rounding bottom breakout. Falling under the crucial 50 and 200 SMAs, the bearish trend prepares to avoid the golden crossover and break below the 100 SMA. Moreover, a fallout below 100 SMA will increase the likelihood of SMAs regaining the bearish alignment.

Ether-tracked futures lost upwards of $236 million, nearly double those of $125 million on bitcoin futures. The losses were unusual for ether, which mostly sees lower liquidations than bitcoin on average trading days.  Futures of Stepn’s GMT tokens racked up $23 million in losses amid headwinds from Chinese authorities, who banned gameplay of the popular ""step-to-earn"" protocol in the country. Futures on solana (SOL) lost $11 million, while metaverse-focused sandbox (SAND) saw $9 million in losses.  Ether dropped to as low as $1,728 in early Asian hours on Friday, losing some 9% of its value over the past 24 hours. A sudden dip to similar price levels on Thursday night was prompted by traders, but this morning’s slide was gradual.  Price charts suggest support at current levels and resistance at $1,900, which acted as pivotal support earlier this month. Similar prices were previously seen in July 2021, and losing the level could see ether drop to the $1,300-$1,500 range or lower.  A fundamental reason for the drop could be a lack of demand for Ethereum’s block space, as per data from analytics firm Glassnode. ""Gas,"" or network fees, prices have been trending downward since December and recently reached multiyear lows, the firm said in a note earlier this week.  Block space is the amount of transactional data that can be included in each block, with users paying gas fees for doing so. Lower block demand generally means a fall in user activity on any particular network.  Meanwhile, analytics firm Coinalyze said in a Twitter message that Thursday’s volatility in ether was succeeded by a sudden increase in open interest on ether futures. Open Interest is the amount of unsettled futures in any market, and an increase in the figure usually implies traders are opening long, or short, positions in anticipation of a move.  Ether and other major cryptocurrencies seemed to stabilize at writing time. Futures and options data for bitcoin suggests traders are positioning for a bearish period ahead, however.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/27/ether-accounts-for-almost-half-of-520m-liquidations-amid-weak-on-chain-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bccc831f8dd370fb89cb1bf36401db0df0e1f14-5400x4465.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

During a Wednesday evening budget debate, the left-wing parties Bloco de Esquerda and Livre proposed taxing digital assets, but the proposal was defeated. According to the proposal, the government should look into taxing bitcoin earnings exceeding €5,000 ($5,340.45). The days of a tax-free crypto-Portugal, though, may be numbered. The Socialist Party, which currently has a majority in the legislature, has yet to introduce legislation. Despite this, there is a risk that Portugal will no longer exempt cryptocurrencies from taxation shortly. Portugal has long been considered a bitcoin tax haven, with revenues from individual cryptocurrency sales being tax-free since 2018. Compared to the current capital gains tax rate of 28% on financial assets, Portugal&apos;s effective capital gains rate on cryptocurrency is 0%.

Findings show that adults and younger generation users are leading the integration of cryptocurrencies into daily financial operations, the report indicates. The survey provides important data related to US user investment sentiment, which has added up to 5% of new adults to the industry compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

This move is known as &apos;The Merge,&apos; and it will be implemented soon. ETH 2.0 will also solve some of the scalability issues, primarily by implementing sharding techniques. However, in order to attain higher degrees of scalability, layer 2 scaling methods are required. Layer 2 solutions aim to increase Ethereum&apos;s scalability by building on top of it rather than from within the blockchain itself. Separate blockchains, known as sidechains, run concurrently with Ethereum Mainnet but independently. For the most part, sidechains do not rely on the security of the main blockchain, and they have their own consensus process in place. As a result of a separate chain existing in parallel to the main chain, a lot of the workload can be migrated to the sidechain, resulting in significantly faster transaction speeds. But What&apos;s All This Got to Do With Bitcoin? Simply said, sidechains are also a boon for Bitcoin, which has been plagued and critiqued due to its scalability issues. However, due to a slight difference in the terminology, people often get confused. The layer 2 scaling solution is commonly referred to as the Lightning Network when it comes to Bitcoin.

42423230,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2XU9h,1653615000,The Curious Case of Coinbase's India Communications Strategy,"Coinbase's ""unrelenting"" and ""audacious"" communications strategy regarding India continues to surprise, according to multiple people across the crypto industry and inside the government.  Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong has been outspoken compared with other industry leaders, for instance taking to Twitter to ask if the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has violated a landmark Supreme Court order with the currently in-place ""shadow ban"" on crypto exchanges. Armstrong later took note of ""informal pressure"" from the RBI as the reason for Coinbase’s trading pause in India within days of its trading launch.  ""What Coinbase is doing is unrelenting and audacious, one after the other, and to most it appears to be a mistake but it could be very bold,"" an industry source told CoinDesk.  As for who is behind this communications strategy, questions remain. Is Armstrong acting on his own? If not, who is advising him, whether from inside the company or externally? Coinbase declined to comment on an inquiry from CoinDesk.  What Coinbase did  On April 7, 2022, Coinbase launched operations in India, with executives touting how easy it would be to trade on the company app with payments being processed by Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, a widely used payments system in India. Hours after the event, though, the entity that governs UPI, (National Payments Corporation of India, under the aegis of the RBI) tweeted to clarify that it was “not aware of any crypto exchange using UPI.”  Within three days, Coinbase suspended operations, and several days later some payment processors cut off local crypto exchanges.  ""It was a reflection of how they don't know how to do business in India,"" said a longtime veteran of financial services in that country. The Coinbase communications strategy, or thereof, ""antagonized authorities,"" according to industry observers and sources.  A CEO who simply speaks his mind?  To be sure, Brian Armstrong's outspoken nature didn't start with India. Among other examples, he had plenty to say regarding crypto as it related to the Canadian trucker protests earlier this year, and there was a Coinbase company memo some time ago in which he suggested the exit of any employee whose values didn't align with his vision for the company.  ""What Armstrong and Coinbase don't get is that in India, [the] RBI is the all-mighty in the financial world and you can't just come in and do whatever the hell you want whoever you may be and not expect backlash,"" said a person with close ties to the country's financial institutions.  As for the RBI itself, Governor Shaktikanta Das declined to directly address the issue, telling CNBC TV 18, ""I would not like to comment on speculative observations made by individuals outside.""  However, the fact that Armstrong is an ""outsider"" in India's crypto space and his claims supported by news articles stated to be ""speculative,"" the comments by Das could be thought to indicate a unique disregard for the Coinbase chief.  Why it matters  Coinbase's trading launch provided an opportunity for governmental institutions to clamp down on crypto, and they took it, according to several crypto industry stakeholders who preferred to remain anonymous.  For the moment, the industry in India is nearly paralyzed, with trading, adoption and enthusiasm all running low. Coinbase's go-it-alone strategy flies in the face of what had previously been a collective effort by the crypto industry to choose dialogue with the government over any move that could further antagonize the powers that be. ""One crypto company which has its biggest interests outside India could be taking a position that disrupts the good work of several others in India,"" said a person from another exchange.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/27/the-curious-case-of-coinbases-india-communications-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7be1dce73e83ef90d1a52cad6458b4ba29dd9c20-3600x2396.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The coin has continued to remain under the $30,000 price level. The technical outlook of Bitcoin could be pointing at a turnaround in prices on the long term price chart. On the short term price chart however, king coin&apos;s price action remains quite bearish. At the time of writing, BTC has seemed to settle a slightly above the $28,000 support line. In the past 24 hours, the coin lost 1.2% of its value and in the last week, the coin posted some recovery. After Bitcoin traded for $28,000, the bulls came to its rescue and have defended that level. This could be accounted to a positive change in price at the time of writing. The $28,000 support line is crucial for Bitcoin as a drop from that level could push the coin to $24,000 or even lower.

This was made possible by selling digital land, a quite popular and big contribution to creating the metaverse. The sale by Bored Ape led to a rush to buy land through the company Yuga Labs, which ultimately slowed down the entire Ethereum blockchain. Due to this, the price of ApeCoin (APE) fell by up to 11%. The company is popular for its Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT (non-fungible token) collection. This includes 10,000 computer-generated cartoon apes worth thousands of dollars. In March, the Bored Ape company received $450 million (€427 million) for the Otherside, a decentralized virtual world with a Bored Ape theme. Even though little is known about Yuga Labs&apos; virtual world, fans rushed to purchase Otherdeeds NFTs. They believed they could exchange them for plots in its virtual land. There were only 55,000 &apos;Otherdeeds&apos; NFTs available for purchase, costing around $700. Investors can only use ApeCoin (APE), a Yuga Labs-created digital currency, to buy them. Because of the high demand, the Ethereum network experienced the most expensive transaction fees, also known as gas fees, in its history.
