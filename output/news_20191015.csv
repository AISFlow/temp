42382838,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7fx,1571175007,eToro Launches Crypto Portfolio Weighted by Twitter Mentions,"That notorious abyss of Crypto Twitter - where the XRP Army patrols, altcoins flourish and falter, and @Vitalik99832182 promising you infinity ETH - got a new plaything today: an eToro crypto portfolio calibrated to the tenor of its tweets.  The new financial instrument is called TheTIE-LongOnly CopyPortfolio, and, as of Tuesday morning, it was live on eToro’s trading platform with a minimum $2,000 buy-in. It’s a partnership between eToro exchange and The TIE data analysis firm, who sources their tweets - about 850,000,000 daily - from Social Markets Analytics.  With an AI system trawling through that massive trove and multiple benchmarks to compare it against, the network calibrates an optimal crypto portfolio based on the sentiments of those tweets, Joshua Frank, CEO of The TIE told CoinDesk.  At launch, the portfolio included five different crypto assets: 47.24% stake in DASH; 23.92% EOS; 21.86% XRP; 5.01% MIOTA; and 1.97% ETC. It rebalances every month.  Frank’s theory: there’s no better intel source for crypto market movements than Twitter - “kind of the epicenter of the crypto universe.”  “Crypto remains an asset class driven by the wisdom of the crowd.”  Money to Be Made  “There’s nothing fundamentally driving the value of crypto,” said Frank. “There’s no earnings, there's no dividends, there’s no revenue.”  Without any of the normal metrics driving stock market values in crypto, investor sentiment takes a leading role in determining the value of different crypto assets, he argues. Crypto trades almost entirely on public outlook.  And public outlook is forged on Twitter.  Like a great swirling ball of pump-and-dump news blasts, the 50,000-odd daily crypto tweets that The TIE’s algorithm sweeps up from Twitter’s daunting 850,000,000 daily output drive the markets, investor sentiment, and ultimately, the price of different crypto assets.  Its the market-moving glue that tells the narrative of crypto traders. And as such, Frank said it is a high value data set for any investor to use.  But before now, Frank said that a platform with The TIE’s level of real-time sophistication was only available to hedge fund managers and their private clients, who could access, and then sift the Twittersphere with the same Social Markets Analytics (SMA) data stream The TIE uses. SMA licenses Twitter’s 'firehose' - the full daily tweet stream - directly from Twitter.  (The TIE is an off-shoot of SMA, and Frank said SMA remains an investor.)  Now, however, anyone with an eToro account can tap directly into the data stream via the new portfolio.  It “brings strategies and investment capabilities that have been reserved to crypto hedge funds up until this point to the average retail investor,” Guy Hirsch, eToro’s U.S. managing director, told CoinDesk.  The result would have paid dividends in the past, eToro and The TIE tell CoinDesk. The companies back tested their algorithm against two years of crypto Twitter content, from October 2017, and found that the resulting portfolio would have returned 281% returns after fees. A portfolio of the same crypto assets would have only returned 29%.  How it Works  TheTie-LongOnly portfolio’s algorithms choose between 13 different coins: BTC, ETH, XRP, IOTA, BCH, NEO, ETC, DASH, EOS, XLM, LTC, ZEC and ADA. eToro and The TIE have not yet discussed adding more, but expect to in the coming years.  Part of the challenge of using Twitter as a dataset is filtering the real content from fake. Frank said that so much of Crypto Twitter activity is fraudulent, either because of bot accounts or designated shills, that it can be daunting to go through it all.  “We’re actually eliminating about 90% of tweets because we think they’re coming from bots or people trying to manipulate the market.”  But even before the algorithm squashes bots, and long before it makes a judgement as to whether a tweet employs positive or negative sentiment, it must intuit whether the tweet is actually about crypto.  “We have to identify and assess the relevance of each individual tweet,” Frank said.  That can be harder than it seems; Frank said that there are 80 overlapping keywords between crypto markets and other areas.  Is that EOS tweet referring to the EOS blockchain and token, or the popular line of Canon cameras? Natural language processing and a comprehensive buzzword dictionary figure it out.  Once those problems are eliminated, the actual sentiment-crunching can begin. Tweet sentiment is compared against tweet sentiment, not against other coins.  “We know, for example, there are a bunch of XRP shills pushing out positive tweets,” Frank explained. “So we’ll say, ‘hey, how much more positive or negative are conversations on XRP today versus the last seven days’” to account for that.  LongOnly’s Long Game  The resulting composite is, predictably, as much an emotional HODL-coaster as any individual coin has ever been. In January 2019 the portfolio would have lost 17% before rebounding 410% come February, a review of TheTIE-LongOnly’s retroactive projections show.  Stuart Colianni, a Machine Learning graduate student at Georgia Tech, who studied the relationship between Twitter sentiment and crypto valuations at Stanford's Information Management program, told CoinDesk massive swings could be a turn-off to investors.  “While the concept is really good and probably fertile ground for pursuing new investment strategies, people just have to be wary of the amount of risk that they’re potentially exposed to.”  But The TIE plans to build tweet sentiment portfolios for investors of queasy constitutions, too. One product in the works takes out 50% long and 50% short positions “so your net exposure to the market is zero,” Frank said.  It’s all in the name of bolstering crypto’s mass adoption, said Hirsch, the eToro manager. He sees the new portfolio as an accessible investment, especially for crypto-curious individuals still mystified by anything blockchain.  “We hope that this will give people on the fence about crypto a path to enter this asset class, as opposed to trying to figure out for themselves when to sell and when to buy.”  Illustration via CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | XRP,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/15/etoro-launches-crypto-portfolio-weighted-by-twitter-mentions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5bf52078c69a3a989a834933ce1016fdf17ce07b-6256x4172.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a public filing published Tuesday, investment management firm Wilshire Phoenix and NYSE Arca filed an amendment to their ETF proposal earlier this month to address issuance and redemption for the securities and the listing/trading of the fund's shares.  Coinbase Custody will act as the custodian for the bitcoin held by the trust, according to the filing. Tuesday's notice says Coinbase will provide attestations confirming the amount of bitcoin it holds within five business days of the trust's monthly rebalancing, adding a detail not present in the original filing.  The amended rule change proposal also notes that CME and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) provide bitcoin futures products in the U.S., rather than CME and Cboe. The latter company wound down its futures product earlier this year.  Later on, the filing seemingly addresses the SEC's concerns with potential market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space.  ""The Sponsor notes that, in connection with the Commission’s analysis of whether a market is inherently resistant to manipulation, the Commission has in certain circumstances focused not on the market as a whole but instead on the significant subset of the market that has a meaningful impact on the particular ETP [exchange-traded product],"" the filing says, adding:  ""For instance, orders approving listing applications of ETPs that invest in gold bullion focused on the spot and futures market, even though gold is traded on a number of different market segments. Focusing on the spot market is appropriate because the spot market is the market to which the particular ETP would look to determine its [net asset value].""  The amendment filed on Oct. 4 ""replaces ... and supersedes"" the original filing ""in its entirety,"" Tuesday's notice said.  The SEC first kicked off the comment period for Wilshire Phoenix's proposal in June, before announcing in late September that it was evaluating the proposal.  According to the filing, members of the public must submit comments within 21 days of the notice's publication in the Federal Register. The SEC has 45 days after the filing's publication in the Register to make an initial decision, but can extend that timeframe if it chooses to do so.  Tuesday's filing follows the SEC's decision to reject a bitcoin ETF proposal filed by Bitwise Asset Management, also working with NYSE Arca. The regulator cited concerns about market manipulation and a lack of surveillance-sharing agreements as an issue in its rejection.

On Tuesday, the auto-giant said it will use blockchain to monitor and automatically implement fuel efficient driving modes for a fleet of vehicles in Cologne, Germany. This is part of a wider pilot program also happening in London and Valencia, Spain.  In collaboration with the City of Cologne, Ford outfitted 10 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with cellular modems that enable geofencing. As the vehicles enter low-emission zones, they will automatically switch to electric-drive.  The metadata, such as when the vehicle enters or exits a zone as well as the miles driven, will be recorded to a blockchain.  The pilot addresses the issues municipal authorities face in administering and implementing low-emissions zones by transmitting data to officials in real-time.  “Security, trust and transparency of emissions data are of paramount importance to all stakeholders in this project, and are key for our vision of cleaner air in the city,” said Gunnar Herrmann, chairman of the management board, Ford-Werke GmbH.  The pilot is part of SmartCity Cologne, a collaborative program to promote climate protection and energy transition.  On Monday, CoinDesk reported that 5 major automakers including BMW, Honda and Ford are working with the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) to implement automatic payments for tolls, parking meters and similar vehicular payments.

42382828,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7Zf,1571162401,'Satoshi' Enters the Oxford English Dictionary,"The Oxford English Dictionary, published by the Oxford University Press, has added ""satoshi"" to its compendium of the English language.  First used less than seven years ago, satoshi is the newest word added to the dictionary. The addition was made as part of a quarterly update to the respected source’s database that also includes the words ""Manhattanhenge,"" ""whatevs"" and a revised history of ""fake news.""  According to the now official OED definition, a satoshi is “the smallest monetary unit in the bitcoin digital payment system, equal to one hundred millionth of a bitcoin,” or 0.00000001 BTC.  OED lexicographers take a descriptive approach to language, meaning that the dictionary observes how words emerge, grow or diminish in popularity and change definitions over time.  The OED's policy says:  “Our role is to monitor and record emerging vocabulary so that we can make new terms available to our dictionary users as soon as they start to gain traction.”  Cited uses of the noun come from Ripple Project, a Usenet newsgroup in 2012, from the Guardian in 2013 and the Times in 2017.  The OED notes American and British pronunciations differ. Stateside, the ""o"" in Satoshi is pronounced like the ""ʊ"" sound in foot, whereas across the pond the ""o"" sounds like the ""ɒ"" in ""lot.""  The word is derived from the proper noun, Satoshi Nakamoto, the “probably pseudonymous” creator or creators of bitcoin. In this context, Nakamoto is an etymon, or a word from which a later word is derived.  Curiously, the authorities on grammar state Nakamoto was “reportedly born in 1975,” referring to one of the only bread crumbs left behind by the mysterious founder when asked to give a birth date on a website where he first described the plan for bitcoin.

And then they enter crypto and it's like, 'No, that’s not how the world works.'”    As a wallet provider, MyCrypto is the first touching point for many crypto newbies, and onboarding non-crypto customers to crypto has its own set of unique challenges.      Monahan said:    “How can we make this similar to existing systems? And where it just is different, how can we educate the user?

In terms of trade finance, relevant documents will be shared on the blockchain so they can be accessed by financial institutions while export bonds will be made available in the same way so that banks can check for duplicate issuings.  These efforts are key elements in the country's Development Plan for Digital Trade, which was introduced by Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki on Oct. 14. Under the plan, blockchain, along with 5G and AI, will be utilized to transform the trade environment and strengthen exports.  ""We will build a digital trading platform that can be easily and conveniently used in all stages of export, such as contracts, customs and logistics,"" Hong said.  A Digital Trade Blockchain Council will be assembled, with a membership including banks, banking associations, trade associations, and the Korea Trade Network (KTNet), which specializes in the automation of trade processes.  The document also mentions that one of the goals of the initiative is to promote blockchain-based foreign exchange transactions. It sets a target of bringing together seven banks by December 2019 to establish the service.  Another element of the plan that will utilize blockchain is the u-Trade-Hub 2.0 (uHT 2.0) initiative.

Providing a view into this data is vital for the future of the industry, Jevans argued, saying:  “Only by helping virtual asset service providers rid their networks of criminals and terrorists will the industry achieve the level of trust required for widespread adoption and government acceptance.”  With the update, the complete financial transaction histories of top cryptocurrencies by market cap such as ethereum, litecoin, and bitcoin cash have become available. Support for ERC-20 tokens and smart contracts has also been added, including transaction and counterparty information, CipherTrace said.  Through features such as transaction alerts for flagged accounts, CipherTrace is marketing its product to government and law enforcement agencies, as well as crypto and blockchain firms that seek to align with increasingly tough international rules.

42382823,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7Ud,1571144413,Peter Thiel Backs $200 Million Valuation for Renewable Bitcoin Mining in the US,"One company is driving its business plan straight into the ""bitcoin wastes too much energy"" argument and has raised $30 million to do so.  That's according to Layer1 co-founder and CEO Alexander Liegl, which plans to bring wind-powered bitcoin mining rigs to West Texas early next year. The company is raising a total of $50 million at a $200 million valuation, he said.  The idea of bitcoin crowding out other uses for clean energy reflects a misunderstanding of the market, Liegl explained in a phone call:  ""Renewable energy is still primarily under-utilized so you don't actually have a zero-sum game.""  The company has so far raised funds for its series A from Peter Thiel, Shasta Ventures and other cryptocurrency investors that it has declined to disclose. This round follows a previous $2.1 million seed round that also included Thiel, as well as the Digital Currency Group.  Further, Liegl questioned the whole premise that the use of electricity to power the bitcoin network is a waste.  ""Bitcoin is the only thing we believe in and that's what we think can lead to disrupting the financial system,"" he said, adding:  ""We think electricity directed to the bitcoin mining network is certainly a net positive for society.""  The company is vertically integrated, in that it plans to run its own bitcoin mining facilities in the United States, using mining rigs that the company designed and built in-house and running its own power procurement.  ""We actually own electricity substations and land-property in Texas already,"" Liegl explained. ""We own everything up to our own power plant, but I can tell you that is certainly on the agenda.""  The company has co-founders with prior expertise in hardware and mining, such that they believe they can execute a sophisticated strategy that makes mining in the U.S. profitable again.  ""The last seven years we think of as mining 1.0,"" Liegl said, with firms doing little more than racing to deploy the most capital. He added:  ""Going forward, the market is shifting to a game of operational expenses.""  Don't mess with Texas  Texas has a major advantage as a cryptocurrency mining location, with energy prices among the very lowest in the nation (particularly for industrial electricity), according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.  ""I love the place. It's so private-market-friendly,"" Liegl said. ""Bitcoin mining is pretty compelling to people out there because it's pretty analogous to how oil and gas works.""  Further, 16 percent of power in Texas comes from wind, according to the Department of Energy. Over 25,000 megawatts have been built with almost 8,000 currently under construction.  While Liegl acknowledges that any operation like his will need a backup power supply for times when wind is not strong enough, the company still expects to deliver a very high proportion of its hashrate via renewable electricity.  The problem for Texas, Liegl explained, is cooling the miners.  Air-cooled miners in Texas would burn up, he explained, so they had to devise a way to liquid-cool the miners. That's what Layer1 has created with its proprietary mining equipment, each unit of which runs on two megawatts of power.  The first facility will be set up in an open area about 90 minutes west of Midland, Texas.  How big is enough?  ""The United States' hash rate share is currently below 5 percent,"" Liegl said. ""Our goal is to bump that up to at least over 15 percent.""  As the company notes in an announcement shared with CoinDesk in advance, 60 percent of bitcoin's hash rate and all of its hardware production is in China. The announcement describes the scale of Layer1's ambition:  ""With this funding, we are positioned to own the whole Bitcoin mining stack by designing, producing, and operating our entire mining infrastructure, including proprietary: ASIC chips, liquid-cooled mining containers and power procurement and development.""  By securing a large amount of funding early, Jacob Mullins of Shasta Ventures said that Layer1 can pursue a more ambitious vision than most startups could, pursuing unit economics that make it attractive as a long-term investment. Further, he believes that as a producer of bitcoin in the U.S., taking a pro-regulator approach, Layer1 will have an advantage when domestic institutions finally move into bitcoin.  ""I think that's another bold way of going at the market and I think over time will create a moat of quality for the business,"" Mullins said.  Of course to meet institutional demand – if it ever comes – will take a lot of bitcoin.  There's no question that Layer1 is going for scale and quickly, but Leigl declined to disclose expected wattage used in 2020, though he said he expected it to be ""many hundreds of megawatts."" He added:  ""Going forward to 2021, we're talking gigwatts.""

Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe,” Riksbank governor Stefan Ingves said the Facebook-led project has been an “incredibly important catalytic event” forcing central bankers to reconsider their primary product: money.  Ingves said the Riksbank – which is working toward piloting an e-krona in the near future – has had to reconsider its own development in light of private currency alternatives. The development of a new kind of currency is a near-unprecedented event, happening only once every few centuries, he added.  “Part of my job is to produce a good/service called the Swedish krona which is convenient to use for Swedish citizens, and if I’m good at that in a technical sense then I don’t have a problem,” Ingves told CNBC, “But if I were to start issuing 20-kilo copper coins the way we did in 1668, then we soon would be out of business.”  Ingves cautioned, though, that most private sector money initiatives ""have collapsed sooner or later.”  The Libra Association gathered in Geneva, Switzerland Monday to sign a formal charter among its now 21 initial members.

42382837,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7iT,1571137214,Bitcoin Sees Little Price Boost From Long-Term Bull Cross,"View  Bitcoin continues to trade flat despite a bullish crossover of the 100- and 200-period moving averages on the three-day chart – a lagging indicator.  BTC may lack clear directional bias for the next few weeks, historical data indicates.  Daily and 4-hour charts continue to call a drop to recent lows below $7,800.  A break above the 200-day moving average at $8,739 is needed to invalidate the bearish case.      A long-term bitcoin chart indicator has turned bullish for the first time in three years.  The bullish crossover sees the 100-period price average cross above the 200-period average on the three-day chart. The last time the chart event occurred was in March 2016.  So far, however, the crossover has failed to buoy prices, leaving the cryptocurrency in the bearish territory below the widely followed 200-day moving average (MA) – a barometer of the long-term trend.  That key hurdle is currently located at $8,739, according to Bitstamp data. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,310, representing a 0.1 percent loss on the day.  It's worth noting that MA crossovers are based on historical data and tend to lag price. As such, they usually work as contrary indicators.  Moreover, crossovers between the longer duration MAs are the product of price rallies. As a result, more often than not, the market is overbought by the time crossover happens and the confirmation is followed by a pullback.  Hence, bitcoin's lack of response to the latest bullish cross is not surprising. Further, bitcoin remained flatlined for months following the March 2016 bull cross of the same MAs, as seen in the chart below.  The 50- and 100-period MAs produced a bullish crossover in the last week of March 2016.  Bitcoin had entered a consolidation phase in the days leading up to the bull cross and remained flat-lined around $420 until witnessing a convincing upside move above $500 in the last week of May.  If history is any guide, BTC may continue to trade in a sideways manner around $8,000 over the next few weeks before resuming the bull run from April's low near $4,000.  For the short term, there's scope for a retest of recent lows near $7,750.  4-hour chart  Bitcoin has been largely restricted to a narrow range of $8,250–$8,450 since Oct. 11.  The consolidation is preceded by a rising channel breakdown – a bearish setup. Further, bitcoin faced strong rejection above $8,800 on Oct. 11 and fell back below $8,500, invalidating the double bottom bullish reversal pattern confirmed on Oct. 9.  A double bottom is a bullish reversal pattern whose success rate is high when it appears after a notable price drop, which was the case here. Even so, the breakout failed, indicating that bearish sentiment is still quite strong.  Hence, the ongoing consolidation is likely to end with a downside move.  Daily candlestick and line chart  Bitcoin created a big bearish engulfing candle on Oct. 11, torpedoing the recovery rally and shifting risk in favor of a drop to lows below $7,800.  With the cryptocurrency trading well below $8,820 (Oct. 11 high), the bearish candle is still valid.  Also, prices remain trapped below the 200-day MA, which has consistently capped upside since Sept. 27. Notably, the cryptocurrency has struggled to gather upside traction in the last few days, despite the bullish divergence of the relative strength index – again a sign of bearish market conditions.  A bullish divergence occurs when the indicator charts higher lows, contradicting lower highs on price and is considered a strong trend reversal indicator.  BTC, therefore, risks revisiting recent lows near $7,750 in the short term. A violation there would imply a resumption of the sell-off from the September highs above $10,000 and open the doors for $7,200.  The bearish case would weaken if and when prices rise above the key MA, currently at $8,739.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The protocol integrates zero-knowledge proofs with smart contracts, enabling private transactions on the public ethereum blockchain.      Procurements are one particular use case. Any enterprise that can leverage different pricing models often leaves money on the table when making purchase orders. Nightfall, however, can set up smart contracts ""without any additional administrative or operational overhead"" that execute at the best price, Brody argues.      Although the basic product remains free on GitHub, Nightfall’s transaction costs are still high at around $10. Brody thinks these costs could drop below $1 in the coming year, meaning that Nightfall could eventually be more cost effective than private, permissioned blockchains.

42382817,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9t7Pb,1571130017,"Next Bitcoin Halving Could Squeeze out Retail Miners, But Jury's Split on Price","Is the next halving going to send bitcoin to the moon?  Well, maybe not that fast. As the programmed reduction of the miners’ reward is approaching (expected to happen in May next year), people are disagreeing about its probable effects.  Bitcoin has gone through the halving two times before, in November 2012 and July 2016, and both times the events marked the beginning of the next bull market. But, it’s an open question if the halving brings an uptrend and if so, how strong that uptrend will be.  Miners took the stage to debate the issue last week at the recent World Digital Mining Summit in Frankfurt organized by Bitmain, the Chinese equipment manufacturer and pool owner.  Price effects  Jihan Wu, co-founder and ex-CEO of Bitmain, is “pessimistic” about the prospect of a price surge after the halving. He suggested that the first two uptrends might have been “catching up with the bubble-and-bust cycle” phases at the time.  Further, he pointed to halving of litecoin in August, which sent the price not surging but plunging. The token's value shot from $31 to $135 in the first half of the year, but then started falling in July, right before the halving. It's now trading around $57.  Wu said:  ""Maybe people speculate too much before the halving, and then you can’t sell the good news anymore. Maybe, this time a bullish cycle is not coming yet.""  Offstage, Wu told CoinDesk that the bump projected from the halving might be baked in because people have ""started to bet on the price growth in advance"":  “During the first and second halving, people didn’t know what to expect, and during the second halving, the scaling debate complicated the situation. Now people are expecting it.”  But Matthew Roszak, chairman of the blockchain software company Bloq, saw things differently. He said that the maturity of the financial ecosystem around bitcoin spoke to it maintaining a higher price over time:  ""There is a better footing for the Fidelitys, Bakkts and other household names entering the space,” Roszak said, adding that the buzz around Facebook's Libra is also attracting new interest and new participants into the industry:  “All the demand from institutional investors is still crescendoing forward. Custody platforms, insurance, compliance, regulatory is all getting written and this is positive for bitcoin.”  Roszak expects the price to reach “somewhere between $15,000 and $100,000” and for the halving to kick off “a decade-plus of rising.”  The purge and the consolidation  Whoever is right about the halving's impact, the event is important for miners worldwide. With the reward being reduced, profitability will also be cut, at least in the short term, so old versions of specialized mining machines, known as ASICs, will stop bringing their owners any profit.  The Antminer S9, the most popular ASIC model manufactured by Bitmain, has exhausted its productivity limit and “a lot of miners are running on a margin of profit,” Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, said on stage. The S9 and Canaan Creative’s Avalon A851 series, with a similar level of hashing power, are some of the most widely used mining equipment right now. Based on the mining pool f2pool’s index, these older models have a profit margin of 50 percent at bitcoin’s current price.  Replacing them with the new machines will help, the panel agreed, but Wu cautioned against miners buying as many machines as possible:  “If I were a mining rig investor, I would be more conservative, but I would keep investing.”  Bitmain released the new Antminer S17 in September and, starting on Friday, will also be selling the more dynamic S17+ version.  Keeping it profitable  Streng, of Genesis Mining, says less hardware in circulation will serve the industry well in the long run. ""We are going towards a really heavy industry with much longer life-cycles of the machines.”  “It’s a very brutal event. Most inefficient miners will be wiped out. But it’s driving the innovation,” Streng told CoinDesk, adding:  “It’s a psychological event, and there is a tendency for the price to increase. From my experience, a lot of miners are expecting the price to go up, so they reduce selling and weaken the selling pressure of the market.”  According to Streng, the main effect of the halving will be wiping out of individual small miners, which now account for less than 20 percent of the market.  Alexander Gavrik, a co-founder of the mining software company Uminers, said the market is getting less volatile as the main players are becoming larger and larger:  “The market is moving towards the industrial mining, and there won’t be hype like it used to be anymore. There are significantly less crypto enthusiasts on the market now.”  ASIC miners image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/15/next-bitcoin-halving-could-squeeze-out-retail-miners-but-jurys-split-on-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc233ab8578b6c77a4f8151135aff9db0d7ded7e-1500x825.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume said Wednesday it has partnered with fintech firm Amun to develop the USD-denominated ETP.  Listed  on the Switzerland’s principal stock exchange SIX under the ticker ABNB, the financial product can be purchased through a bank or brokerage like a stock.  Amun CEO Hany Rashwan told CoinDesk the ETP will initially be backed by $20 million worth of Binance coins (BNB), representing nearly a quarter of the firm's total crypto assets under management.  Since launching the first crypto-backed ETP in Nov. 2018, Rashwan said Amun’s suite of 8 crypto-ETPs are backed by $75 million in total assets.  The regulated ETP provides an avenue for investors to gain exposure to one of the top performing cryptocurrencies. According to Messari, BNB has a $2.84 billion market capitalization, making it the eighth largest crypto by that metric. In recent months, daily transaction volume usually top $100 million.  BNB is used to pay transaction fees on the exchange and for Binance's development and projects marketing. The exchange completed its initial coin offering (ICO) of 100 million BNB in 2017, raising approximately $15 million.  Binance has capped the supply of BNB at 200 million tokens, of which the firm plans to “burn” half to prevent depreciation.

The British digital tokenization firm is now working with IIP Securities, an international banking consultancy based in New York, as it prepares to bring its security token crowdfunding model stateside.  The alliance provides Smartlands access to IIP Securities’ broker-dealer license - a critical element for complying with U.S. regulatory framework and one that has proven difficult, but not impossible, for digital asset firms to win on their own.  With the license secured, Smartlands CEO Ilia Obraztsov told CoinDesk that his firm will keep building out its global tokenized investments platform on the stellar network.  “Our goal is to tokenize one billion dollars in assets by 2024.” Obraztsov said. “On this road the United States is the next step.”  For asset-holders interested in fractionalized ownership Smartlands’ UK efforts may provide a roadmap. In June the company launched one of Britain's early real estate tokenization projects, crowdfunding about £1 million for a student housing complex.  That listing is projected to yield investors about 15% annually. Obraztsov said modest returns on low-risk assets will continue to be Smartlands’ target as it moves beyond real estate. Green energy, commodities and late-stage startups are all being considered, Obraztsov said.  Smartlands had already been working under UK regulators’ approval and its partnership with IIP Securities only clears one barrier to U.S. entry. Both firms will gin up on local regulatory framework in the coming months. They intend to launch in the U.S. in Spring 2020.  Crowded playing field  Smartlands wants to build a “one-stop shop” for security token issuance, marketing and exchange in the US, Obraztsov said. Many other companies want to do the same.  In the past year a handful of high-profile crypto-focused firms have moved towards securing broker-dealer licensing, including the Winklevoss-controlled Gemini exchange and Harbor, which recently gained regulator approval.  “Harbor’s securing a broker-dealer license was a huge step forward for the security token landscape,” Obraztsov said. He welcomes the competition.  “We think property rights market is really huge, in the hundreds of trillions. There is room for everybody.”  Smartlands' developers mostly work out of Vilnius, Lithuania, and Kiev, Ukraine. Galyna Danylenko, PR Lead for Smartlands, said the company would build out a New York team soon.
