42399100,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQd5,1467753447,Uber Argentina Enlists Bitcoin Partner in Fight to Continue Service,"The Argentinian subsidiary of international ridesharing giant Uber is turning to bitcoin amid what has been described as a crackdown by local authorities on its operations.  Bitcoin industry startup Xapo told CoinDesk today that is has entered a partnership with Uber that allows the company to accept its bitcoin debit cards, and for users to use the payment option when traveling domestically or abroad.  First revealed in a tweet by Uber Argentina this weekend, the action is the latest in an escalation between law enforcement and the Silicon Valley startup that centers on whether Uber is properly incorporated in the South American country, or acted illegally in launching its product in the country.  To date, the dispute has seen police raid the homes of individuals suspected to be connected with the company, as well as actions taken against domestic payments providers to prevent them from processing Uber transactions, according to AFP.  Xapo representatives said they see the event as a way to boost adoption of the startup's product, which allows users to load the debit card with bitcoin, and for that bitcoin to be converted at the point-of-sale in purchases over traditional card rails.  Xapo product manager Anni Rautio told CoinDesk:  ""This is a win for all local Uber users and drivers, and for Uber as a company, as they are able to continue operations in Argentina through Xapo's Debit Card. It's also great news for bitcoin: it's one step closer to seeing mainstream companies adopt bitcoin.""  Rautio said that the partnership began last week, and that Xapo has already seen an increase in interest for its debit card product following the announcement.  While it remains to be seen whether this will boost bitcoin use in the region, local news sources report 550,000 users have downloaded the app and the situation seems likely to continue. Uber officials have called resistance to its startup in Buenos Aires the “fiercest” it has experienced around the world, all the while showing signs it intends to push forward in an effort to serve users.  Prior to the partnership with Xapo, Uber Argentina had made other alternative payment methods available including CardNow, Papipago and Neteller.

42399097,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQa8,1467750636,European Union Adopts Tighter Bitcoin Controls Amid Terrorism Crackdown,"The executive branch of the European Union today adopted a proposal meant to make it more difficult for terrorists and money-launderers to operate by revising existing anti-money laundering (AML) protections.  Tucked away in the list of changes proposed by the European Commission is a measure specifically designed to prevent terrorists from using virtual currencies and other financial tools deemed as risk for abuse, such as prepaid cards.  Under the terms of the proposal, virtual currency exchanges and custodian wallet providers will be brought under the purvey of the EU's Anti-Money Laundering Directive. As such, they will be required to apply due-diligence controls ""ending the anonymity associated with such exchanges"".  In statements, first vice president of the commission Frans Timmermans, sought to connect the actions to international security.  Timmermans said:  ""Today's proposals will help national authorities to track down people who hide their finances in order to commit crimes such as terrorism.""  The European Commission also notably presented a ""parallel"" proposal aimed at preventing tax evasion techniques as revealed in the Panama Papers, leaked documents released earlier this year that catalogued methods for hiding money in off-shore accounts.  Other measures in the proposal adopted today were aimed specifically at tax avoidance and money laundering, including lowering the ownership threshold of those in trusts whose identities must be made public.  Key actions proposed include increased protections for whistleblowers and additional information sharing between EU member states.  European regulation in transit  This year the European Union has aggressively taken steps toward regulating virtual currency due to concerns about the perceived ""anonymity"" of users.  In January, the European Parliament first gathered in Brussels to discuss stricter controls over virtual currency following terrorist attacks in Paris. A month later the parliament proposed a task force on virtual currencies to further research the technology.  Following today's decision, the proposal related will be submitted to the European Parliament for consultation and adoption.  Under the terms of the virtual currency rules adopted today, member states need to implement the changes and other counter-terrorism financing actions by the end of the year.

42399103,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQf3,1467743982,"At W3C Event, Industry Seeks to Weave Blockchains into New Web","Armed with sky-high expectations and seemingly boundless enthusiasm for how tech could reinvent industry in the digital age, the ""blockchain"" industry has been overwhelmed with blockchains.  Not only are there multiple open public blockchain projects, but legacy institutions and corporates are building exclusive permissioned blockchains. So far this year, there have been specialty blockchains created for everything from credit default swaps to managing global supply chains.  It's unclear how these blockchains will need to interact with each other in the future to prove its benefits. But there’s consensus that some standards are needed to promote competition while eliminating redundancies.  Entering into this wider discussion is the W3C, the international standards body for web development that has taken an interest in web payments.  Last week, the W3C held its first blockchain workshop, an event that showcased how many areas of the industry are ripe for standardization as well as how much work needs to be done to bring together various stakeholders working on the technology.  Among the participants, a few were apprehensive about standardization, thinking the industry was too young and standards could impede progress made through experimentation. The majority, however, see this discussion as one that’s driven by business need.  Christopher Allen, principal architect at blockchain tech company Blockstream, told CoinDesk:  ""In order to move forward and work with other organizations we can’t all have different data formats and APIs. No one will buy into that if we do it that way.""  Data first  Which is why there’s plenty of talk about interoperability.  Most participants were interested in developing standard APIs and primitive data formats (those provided by the programming language) to allow both new and legacy applications to have consistent approaches to communicating with blockchains.  First objectives in this area included key management and payment protocols, and most are layers above blockchain that use cryptographic approaches.  Several representatives working on the Interledger Protocol and Lightning, a variation on bitcoin lightning networks, were in the room and had discussions on how those two similar systems could move forward so that transactions on both could be more compatible.  ""There are some things that aren’t worth keeping completely different and fighting over,"" said Allen. ""It will have an impact on the community as a whole in the future if we’re fractured too much.""  Allen used SSL, a security technology he helped develop in the 1990s, as an example of the Web community coming to agreement over its approach and allowing all stakeholders to participate equally.  This constructive collaboration is why Blockstream began participating in standards organizations. And while there were several well-known blockchain efforts in the room (Eris Industries, IBM Blockchain Labs, MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, ethereum), notably, not many popular bitcoin industry stakeholders were at the workshop.  These bitcoin players could have been helpful as the group discussed the possible standardization of wallet APIs. Some of these topics included the process for getting signed blocks written to a blockchain, how information is stored within blocks and what information can be stored off-chain.  Hardware authentication was another area of significant interest.  While dongles have been used for authenticating financial transactions within enterprise, dedicated hardware devices haven’t seen much success for consumer applications. Instead, many industry stakeholders think a user’s smartphone with SD cards and biometrics can be used to verify identity.  Identity and authentication  It all comes back to identity, said Doug Schepers, a W3C technologist and team contact that organized the workshop.  ""The reason people are so interested in it is because usernames and password and the existing way identity is done is so flawed and hard to deal with,"" he said. The idea is that transacting with a public/private key pair over a blockchain is more convenient and secure than today’s username/password identity schemes.  Standardizing these identity iterations could move forward at a quicker pace because Microsoft is a powerful member of the browser-focused W3C already. Plus, the vendor has secured a number of partners for its blockchain identity programhttps://blog.blockstack.org/blockstack-labs-partners-with-microsoft-3ffccebf3f4f, and several representatives from Samsung’s mobile browser work spoke with Microsoft at the workshop about joining the identity initiative.  These developments are especially important as the threat and instance of data breaches increases, occurring even at large institutions like Anthem and Swift.  But while there’s meaningful excitement for blockchain identity efforts, some uneasiness mostly from the incumbents still persists.  Several representatives of legacy financial services providers voiced concerns about counterfeiting and account takeover as it relates to blockchain systems which tout irrevocable and immutable identity.  Others worried that blockchain systems only recreate the current system whereby a person’s identity information is stored under one master key.  Licensing and provenance  There was also discussion about how such standards could impact non-financial blockchain applications.  At the workshop, this category revolved around content creators, and several presenters mentioned the ability to trade cryptocurrency tokens like contracts on a blockchain to have a transparent record of the history of digital media.  The Internet of Things (IoT) could benefit from a transparent history of transactions and liability. Many think this era of connected devices communicating with each other will work through ""if this, then that"" smart contracts riding on blockchains.  Examples include washing machines that detect issues and search warranty information to order parts or smart packages that monitor the temperature of shipments.  Most IoT solutions today are based on centralized, hierarchical systems which are more vulnerable to attack than distributed, decentralized systems. Plus, today’s systems are typically device- instead of user-centric. In device-centric models, users would have separate apps for each device they had connected to the internet.  Blockchains, many participants said, could coordinate a user-centric IoT environment.  Next steps  It seems the event has already inspired industry participants.  One community group focusing on digital assets has already been formed since the event and plenty of others were conceived. The majority of these community groups will incubate ideas for standardization, allowing members to start forming specifications.  W3C’s general blockchain community group will continue to expand its scope and keep the conversation going. Schepers also plans on organizing a follow-up workshop more focused on the browser vendors.  As the first event of its kind, the blockchain workshop demonstration of how similar events will need to improve to get more people on board.  For example, many conversations at the conference were more theoretical than concrete. Participants talked about how blockchains could revolutionize various industries, but the technical details of how these systems would do that were often glossed over.  But working inside these standards bodies can not only allow blockchain tech to realize the reach of the web, but also cultivate environments for critical thought about how tech interacts with people.  Keynote speaker and assistant professor of computer science at Princeton, Arvind Narayanan, gave the workshop a particularly important note of caution here.  He said:  ""There’s a tendency in blockchain world to jump too far and to try to find technological solutions to social problems. There’s a heavy responsibility when dealing with humans; standardization can act as a key check to this problem … as it offers opportunity for introspection.""

42399094,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiQZ9,1467740791,Donald Trump Presidency Could Be a Boost to Bitcoin,"Global concern over the possible election of Donald Trump, along with other macroeconomic concerns, could lead to a massive jump in bitcoin transactions, according to a new report.  The digital currency that is increasingly being linked to spikes in price during times of economic instability would likely experience such a spike following a Trump election, Juniper Research has found.  In interview, research author Windsor Holden said that it was specifically Trump's ""aggressive attitude"" towards China and Mexico and ""bellicose statement towards Muslims"" that have him and some other economists concerned.  Holden, who is also Juniper’s head of forecasting, said that Trump’s ""hostility to free trade"" could lead to the imposition of tariffs and that his threats to ban Muslim’s from entering the US could serve as a recruiting tool for jihadists.  Holden told CoinDesk:  ""Should these outcomes come to pass, then there will clearly be a substantial negative effect on numerous national economies, including the US itself. Hence, should it appear that a Trump Presidency is a distinct possibility, expect a marked uplift in the volume of bitcoin transaction(s) – and in the value of bitcoin itself.""  More than Trump  A depreciation in the value of the yuan and uncertainly over Britain’s departure from the European Union are also both cited as reasons why bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a hedge investment.  That, coupled with the reduction in bitcoin supply as a result of the halving of bitcoin’s mining reward this month, could potentially lead to bitcoin transactions reaching $92bn this year, triple what it was at the year’s beginning, the report said.  In March, the Economist included Trump on its list of the Top 10 Global Risks published earlier this year, which was also included in the Juniper report.  Uncertainly in China and the impending exit of Britain from the EU were also named, and since its release, both China’s economic struggles and Britain’s departure from the EU have been connected with recent spikes in the price of bitcoin.  Increased adoption  In addition to perceived global instability as a result of various socio-economic considerations, the Juniper report cites increased adoption as a factor.  Specifically, the report mentioned reduced cost of processing, reduced fraud risk, and the easy of cross-border transactions as factor in the increased adoption.  From the report:  ""Given bitcoin’s continued upward trajectory and the likelihood that this will continue prior to the halvening, we believe that for 2016 as a whole, transaction value is likely to be at or around 3.5 times that in 2015.""

42378805,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lmVZ,1467727224,The Bitcoin Halving Will Trigger a Fear of Missing Out,"Akin Fernandez is the owner of bitcoin voucher service Azteco and an active technology blogger under the pen name 'Beautyon'.  In this piece, Fernandez offers his take on the upcoming halving of the bitcoin network subsidy and what it means for those who risk ""being left out"".  Very shortly, there will be an important scheduled change in the way bitcoin is generated. The rate at which new bitcoin is created will halve, an event popularly referred to as ""the halving"".  At the time of this writing, 3,600 BTC ($2.4m) are generated every day. This will be slashed to 1,800 BTC per day ($1.2m), and the rate will never ever increase.  Taking this into account, and some basic economics, we should be able to make predictions about how the perception of bitcoin may change, but since the perception of bitcoin is almost entirely irrational, save for the thinking of a handful of very clever men, it is almost impossible to predict how people will react to the halving.  Bitcoin was designed to be released onto the market in a slow and predictable way. This was done to incentivize the security of the network through its generation as well as limit the supply of bitcoin so that it could attain a nominal value and not ""flood"" the market. This plan has worked spectacularly well, and is a further testament to Satoshi's understanding of economics (The Austrian School) and human behavior.  From a plain utility perspective, nothing will change when the rate of bitcoin creation halves. You will be able to transact with your bitcoin normally and won’t notice any difference at all. As for the effect on the price of bitcoin, the price of bitcoin doesn't matter if you are using it as a money transporter.  You put $100 in vitcoin in at one end, send it over the network to your recipient, and she can either redeem $100 or spend that same value on Amazon via a service like Purse, or anywhere that accepts bitcoin.  Bitcoin’s price is irrelevant to the user if a company’s business model adapts to bitcoin’s true nature.  It is also important to bear in mind that the finite nature of bitcoin doesn't impede its long-term, low-level flexibility. Improvements can be made to the protocol, increasing capacity, guaranteeing anonymity and ensuring its distributed nature, all without touching the central benefit of bitcoin; its guaranteed limited money supply.  Furthermore, the amount of money that can ""fit into"" bitcoin before and after the halving will not change. The amount of fiat currency that can fit into bitcoin is infinite. Bitcoin can absorb all the money that currently exists in the world, and yes, that would be a good thing.  Bitcoin history bunk  Each bitcoin has a history attached to it. You can explore where a bitcoin has been using one of the many Bitcoin Explorer tools, one of the best being OXT’s Graphalizer application.  Because bitcoin is not anonymous (or well understood), there is a false idea that bitcoin can be “tainted” by circulation. This is why some businesses with bitcoin surveillance tools close the accounts of users that receive bitcoin from what they wrongly consider to be ""tainted addresses"".  Fresh bitcoin is bitcoin that has just been mined and which has never been spent. It has no transaction history, and nothing can be assumed about it, other than that it its spendable; it is ""clean bitcoin"" to their thinking, in this incorrect mental picture of bitcoin.  Obviously, the idea that there is ""clean bitcoin"" and ""dirty bitcoin"" is completely absurd; bitcoin is data, and everything people think about it is imputed. There isn't a strong market for “fresh bitcoin” yet, so that should not be a factor at all in the halving.  If it were, we would expect the price of fresh bitcoin to at least double. There probably won’t be a market for fresh bitcoin in the future when Bitcoin is more anonymous, which is the only perceived advantage of fresh or ""history-less"" bitcoin.  Speculative boost  Perception changes however, could cause the price of bitcoin to spike. The halving of bitcoin’s generation rate is likely to cause an increase in speculation.  Anyone using bitcoin as a speculative investment will be interested in the halving. Simple supply and demand says so… or maybe not; Bitcoin exchanges are not rational yet.  It is reasonable to speculate that logically, this event and the others that will follow will increase the price and perception of bitcoin’s structural stability. People may start to understand that this halving is one of several to come, and now is the time to get into bitcoin before subsequent reductions in production kick in on schedule and the price spikes again.  It all depends on how you choose to use and view bitcoin.  One thing we can say for sure; bitcoin is an exceptionally stable system that is absolutely immutable. It is slowly beginning to dawn on people that you can rely on bitcoin to exhibit a fixed set of characteristics that cannot be changed by public opinion, a handful of men with a particular use case, or the desires of anyone who chooses to use it for any purpose.  The 'C' of money  The need for immutable international standards has been understood for centuries. It is impossible to perform trades for goods if everyone is using a different standard for weights and measures.  This is why the definition of the meter was very carefully specified in 1875 in The Treaty of the Meter at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Sevres, France. Thirty prototype standard lengths made of platinum-iridium ally in an “X” profile were manufactured to exacting standards and distributed to different countries.  By doing this, every country was ""on the same page"" when it came to the definition of the word ""meter"".  Today, the metre is defined as the distance travelled by light in 1/299 792 458th of a second. Bitcoin is like the length of a meter; a global standard that is securely set in the same way that one of the fundamental forces of nature is unchangeable; the speed of light, ""c"".  You can use the definition of a meter for any purpose. You can use it to produce rulers of wood or steel, or use it to create rulers made of light. The purpose of a meter is to act as a point of reference, a standard, that cannot change. Bitcoin is the same. It is not there to piggyback your political views or be an aid for your flawed business model, any more than the meter is there to aid cartographers over carpenters.  You must deal with bitcoin on its terms, in the same way that you deal with measurement standards and mathematical constants.  Once people begin to understand what the idea and impact of a global, math-based, non-governmental standardized monetary unit means (and the fact that you can transact with something that acts as a fundamental force of nature), the entire idea of what money is will change forever.  This has profound implications for every economic process and every person on Earth.  There are only 5,286,750 BTC left to be issued by the network.  Compared to the value of all the goods and services on Earth, this is a small number, taking into account that each bitcoin can be split into a million pieces. Clearly, bitcoin is one of the most undervalued systems, services, databases, assets, networks or tokens (depending on your application) currently available to man, and even if an ultimate total utilization is never realized, the truth of what bitcoin is cannot change because it is based on maths, and not people’s opinions.  Even if bitcoin absorbs 10% of all global commerce, it will be spectacularly useful and valuable.  Above all other considerations, this is the fundamental breakthrough; Bitcoin is an opinion-less, irresistible standard system based only on math.  It is globally available as an infallible means of exchange, and accounting without any new functionality being required. It belongs to no single country, is incorruptible, unstoppable and completely eliminates payer fraud.  The 2016 halving and the others that will follow as the bitcoin generation curve tops out are key points where this should be reiterated as a warning to those who still refuse to accept the consequences of bitcoin’s existence and the truth of math.  ""A danger foreseen is half avoided, and a man warned is half saved"". The danger is being left out of bitcoin.

However, this isn't stopping startups from moving ahead on this objective. Toward this goal, digital identity startup Netki has announced it has raised $3.5m in a seed round led by O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures (OATV).  Joining the round was domain name provider, Donuts, Colle Capital, The Husseini Group, Digital Currency Group, Bitfinex, Plug and Play, Base Ventures and Tom Turney.  In an interview, Netki CEO Justin Newton, explained that the funds were raised to help the company, founded in 2014, continue with its growth.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We plan to use the funds to invest in our technology and grow our team in order to support customer growth.""  For O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, this marks its first investment in a blockchain startup.  Ease of use  Netki was launched by Justin and Dawn Newton, both of whom were part of early Internet companies. (Justin Newton designed technology for AboveNet, NetZero/United Online, Demand Media and Blackline, while Dawn grew support operations at NetZero/United Online and worked at Microcom and InterAccess).  At Netki, their primary focus has evolved from this background.  To date, it has seen the entrepreneurs target applications that they believe are ready to be used today that can reduce the barrier of entry for blockchains, with a primary focus on identity projects.  Its first product, the Wallet Name Service, launched in the beginning of 2015 in an attempt to create a cleaner wallet address, and companies that have integrated Netki’s wallet naming service are Purse, BitSo, Bitt and BlockCypher.  Its latest product, announced at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2016, is a soon-to-be launched digital identity certificate, which it has compared to an SSL Certificate for the blockchain.  The company anticipates its digital identity certification offering will be in full production by the end of 2016.
