The enormous climb in value in a short time is responsible for all the chatter. One particular whale turned $27 into more than $4M. Yet, according to the cryptocurrency community, the owner do the related wallet might never be able to cash in on those gains. “Blacklisted” Pepe Wallet Left A Sad Frog The meme coin based on Pepe the Frog has everyone who bought in earlier today, feeling good. Aside from a little chop here and there, the rising star in crypto simply wont stop climbing higher.

This rounds out to roughly 0.59% of the max supply. The only problem, is that according to crypto Twitter, the owner of the coins cannot cash out, and has been “blacklisted.” User “Borovik.ETH” claims it was a dev’s wallet, and therefore is unable to sell their holdings. Ethereum versus the frog king of the memes | PEPEUSDC on TradingView.com Why The King of Meme Coins Could Keep Climbing Shocking stories of fortunes being made by simply buying and holding Pepe are growing by the day. And while the early returns are certainly substantial, because of the dynamics of price discovery, it could be nowhere near done. New cryptocurrencies perform the best as capital and liquidity rushes in. With no bagholders to speak of, there is no real resistance levels leading to large price increases and extended moves.

The same can be said for more recent altcoins like Chainlink or Solana. In the comparison above, Pepe can be seen side-by-side with Ethereum. The chart, made for entertainment purposes, is pure speculation and designed to demonstrate the lack of price history and clear skies Pepe has above current levels.

12357083,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529982,1683243046,"Bitcoin On-Chain Transactions Reach New Heights, What’s Fueling the Surge?","The number of daily Bitcoin (BTC) transactions on the blockchain has risen, reaching an all-time high of 682,000 on May 1st. Rafael Schultze-Kraft, one of the founders of Glassnode, has suggested that this increase in transaction volume is likely due to a combination of factors. Related Reading: US Regional Bank Failures Trigger Bitcoin Surge, $30,000 Level In Sight Bitcoin Transactions Skyrocket Rafael argues that one key driver is the growing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors and large corporations. As more companies begin to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets and offer it as a payment option, the demand for Bitcoin transactions has more potential to increase. Another factor contributing to the rise in Bitcoin transactions is the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. These applications, built on top of blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin, allow users to borrow, lend, and trade cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, Schultze-Kraft notes that the recent surge in Bitcoin transactions could be a sign of increased interest and activity in the cryptocurrency space more broadly. As more people become aware of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In addition, according to Schultze-Kraft, the current surge in transaction counts is noteworthy because it is more than double the baseline established in 2022, which had been relatively stable at around 250,000 transactions per day, as seen in the chart above. A notable increase in the use of Taproot transactions has accompanied the recent surge. According to data from Glassnode, Taproot transactions accounted for 37.5% of spent outputs on April 30th, and on May 1st, a record-breaking 60% of all Bitcoin transactions used Taproot. So, what is Taproot, and why is its adoption increasing? Taproot is a proposed upgrade to the Bitcoin network designed to improve privacy and efficiency. It achieves this by combining multiple BTC script paths into a single output that can be spent using a single signature. This makes transactions smaller and cheaper, which can help to reduce congestion on the network and lower fees. Taproot was first proposed in 2018, but it has taken some time for the Bitcoin community to reach a consensus on its implementation. However, with the recent activation of Taproot looking increasingly likely, more users and businesses are starting to adopt the technology. Furthermore, the recent surge in Taproot transactions in the Bitcoin network can be attributed to the heavy increase in text inscriptions, according to Rafael Schultze-Kraft. More than 50% of all transactions on the Bitcoin network have been associated with text inscriptions. When separating transactions related to text inscriptions from all other Bitcoin transactions, it becomes clear that they are the sole driver for the recent increase in BTC activity, surpassing the total number of all other transactions for a brief time. The data from Glassnode shows that text inscriptions are far more popular than others on the Bitcoin network, including images, videos, and audio. While there are some uses for these other types of inscriptions, such as embedding a digital signature or proof of ownership, text inscriptions seem the most versatile and widely used. As the Bitcoin network continues to evolve and adapt to changing user needs, there will likely be more innovations and upgrades that will further enhance its functionality and usability. Whether through text inscriptions or other technologies, it is clear that BTC is becoming more than just a financial instrument but also a powerful tool for communication and expression.

12356524,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529844,1683241214,Pro-XRP Attorney Shares Information That Could Be Bullish For Ripple,"In a new development, a pro-XRP attorney has shared some startling information that could point toward victory for Ripple in its ongoing securities battle against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This ruling in another case that was similar to what Ripple is currently fighting with the SEC shows there could be a positive outcome for the crypto firm after all of this. A Case Similar To Ripple Gets Good Judgement Attorney Jeremy Hogan took to Twitter to share a previous ruling by Judge Analisa Torres in another case involving a crypto mining company Rio Tinto and the SEC. In the cutout of the ruling posted by Hogan, it shows that the judge previously ruled that there was no liability on the part of Rio Tinto when “the sole basis for such claims is alleged misrepresentations or omissions,” something that is also present in the Ripple case. Related Reading: This Meme Coin Created By GPT-4 Is Now Worth $40 Million, Here’s Why Now, as expected, the SEC appealed the judgment by Judge Torres but the interesting thing is that the appellate court upheld the judgment. The crypto company emerged victorious in this case, as the judge did not see any evidence of scheme liability, saying that Rio Tinto only “failed to prevent misleading statements from being disseminated by others.” I was just reminded of a case in which Judge Torres ruled against the SEC on a key issue, the SEC appealed, and the appellate court upheld Judge Torres. SEC v. Rio Tinto. Just don't ask how long the whole process took. pic.twitter.com/4EPoU4mnhx — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) May 3, 2023 What makes this important is that Judge Torres is also the presiding judge in the Ripple v. SEC case and such a judgment on a previously similar case could also translate to a similar judgment for Ripple. If so, then this is a positive for the company. What A Victory Would Mean For XRP The Ripple v. SEC case has dragged on for a couple of years now which has negatively impacted the price of XRP. In 2020 when the bull market was starting to roll around, Ripple was hit with a lawsuit that saw XRP’s price crash over 50%, and while other cryptocurrencies in the space went on to see new all-time highs in the next year, XRP suffered tremendously. Even now, the token is yet to reach its full potential but a Ripple victory would turn the tide on this. An example of what kind of impact such a victory would have on the price was back in Q1 2023 when CEO Brad Garlinghouse said he expected the case to come to a close in the first half of 2023. XRP price struggles at $0.46 | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com The price of XRP soared on this news and reached as high as $0.55 before correcting back downwards. However, it worked to show what such news could do to the price. It is entirely possible that a Ripple victory would push the digital asset to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Is Meme Coin Season Back? Here’s What The Numbers Say As for if the SEC would take such a judgment lying down, Hogan responded to a Twitter user that he does not think the SEC would appeal. Furthermore, he cited two other lawyers who are familiar with the case who also believe that the SEC would not appeal if Judge Torres were to rule in favor of Ripple. However, all of this remains to be seen. At the time of writing, XRP’s price seems to be moving in tandem with the general market trend. It is trading at a price of $0.46, with a minor 0.43% increase on the 7-day chart.

I see upside potential to crypto, and ETHE is one way to play momentum in the space. While it carries a high fee and a concerning discount to its holding value per share, the upside prospects outweigh the negatives. Crypto prices have enjoyed a stellar 2023 after a tough 2022. Year-to-date, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up 77% while Ethereum (ETH-USD) is higher by 60%. Investors have been flocking back to digital currencies amid global central bank uncertainty and turmoil at times in the banking world. With a falling US dollar in the last year, that has been another boon to crypto. Consider that more global investors and consumers, particularly younger people, are increasingly adopting crypto as a preferred unit of exchange. In America, we don't see it quite as much, but jump overseas or visit South America, and you'll realize that de-dollarization is becoming more popular. More People Are Adopting Crypto Worldwide GWI Research I have a bullish outlook on Ethereum, but I am cautious on the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) due to its high fee and growing discount to its holdings value per share. Overall, my buy rating is premised on strong near-term momentum and global policy uncertainty with traditional currencies. Strong Crypto Momentum In 2023 StockCharts.com According to the issuer , ETHE's investment objective is for the value of its Shares (based on ETH per share) to reflect the value of Ethereum held by the Trust, less fees and expenses. To date, ETHE has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Ethereum held by ETHE, less ETHE's expenses and other liabilities, but have instead traded at a premium or discount to such value, which at times has been substantial. The Trust's ETH is stored in offline or ""cold"" storage with Coinbase Custody Trust Company, a fiduciary under §100 of the New York Banking Law and a qualified custodian for purposes of Rule 206(4)-2(d)(6) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. You can learn more about ETHE specifics here . Total assets under management of the fund are $5.5 billion as of the end of March while the market cap of the fund is $2.8 billion. Owning ETHE means paying a high 2.5% annual sponsor's fee, similar to a mutual fund or ETF's expense ratio. There may be additional expenses payable by the trust, per Grayscale. As of the end of the first quarter, one share of ETHE represents 0.00973361 ETH. ETHE's market price is $9.04 as of the close on May 3, a steep discount to the $18.15 holdings value per share (like a fund's net asset value). ETHE's Market Price/Share Is At A >50% Discount To Holdings/Share 50% Discount to Holdings/Share"" contenteditable=""true""> Grayscale Historically, the fund has traded at an increasingly large discount to the holdings/share value. In the quarters after ETHE's inception, the trust traded at a premium to the hypothetical fair value. While many analysts consider the discount to be an upside factor in their theses, I am cautious about how that spread will evolve. With ongoing banking risks and custody concerns in the crypto space, I would not place big bets on the market price reverting to the holdings value any time soon, however, the discount would revert should the trust convert to an ETF. Regulators continue to be hesitant to approve such spot crypto ETFs, though. A Growing Discount Grayscale Seasonally, while May has historically featured the second-biggest average monthly climb, the summer months can feature volatility. June and September are, on average, rough months while only July boasts a better than 50/50 historical trend of higher prices when assessing the June through September timeframe. So, the seasonal tailwinds could be abating. ETH-USD Seasonality: Strong May, Tougher Summer StockCharts.com The Technical Take Homing in on the chart of ETHE, notice in the view below that there are bullish factors. First, the trust broke out from a protracted downtrend resistance line earlier this year. At the same time, ETHE was establishing a bullish rounded bottom pattern. But there's still work to do: In my technical opinion, the share price needs to break above the $12 level to confirm the bullish reversal. If it does, I see an upside price target to near $17. There is also an old gap just shy of $20 that lingers. Another bullish catalyst is the 200-day moving average that has just recently turned positive in its slope. So, while I am cautious on the fundamentals of ETHE as an investment product, the chart is bullish. I see support near $8 and near $6.85 (the early 2020 range lows).

Shares have plenty of momentum (buoyed by strong buying) going into the report. Earnings and cash flow are expected to be boosted this year due to significantly higher annual sales. Intro We recently wrote about Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) back in March post the company's full-year numbers when we stated that the growth potential of the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner continued to outweigh downside risks in the stock. The above premise has actually played itself out over the past six weeks, as shares have rallied over 21% whereas the S&P has only returned just over 4% over the same timeframe. In fact, if we look at the technical chart below, we see that shares of MARA managed to punch above overhead resistance (and the stock's respective 200-day moving average) in early April where these former resistance levels should now act as underside support (which is what we are seeing). Furthermore, buying volume has continued to remain very strong in MARA in recent weeks, demonstrating that investors continue to see more upside potential over downside risk in this play. MARA Technical Chart (StockCharts.com) Bitcoin Tailwind In our March commentary, we stated that if the relationship between the miner's profitability & valuation could continue to improve in upcoming quarters, then downside risk would continue to decline and that is what appears to be playing itself out here. Obviously, a rising Bitcoin price would also play into MARA's bullish picture and this is what we have seen with Bitcoin up well over 4% over the past six weeks alone. MARA announces its fiscal first-quarter earnings numbers on the 9th of May next, where the bottom-line GAAP estimate comes in at -$0.09 per share. Although expected bottom-line profitability remains in negative territory, earnings revisions in MARA continue to be dialed up, resulting in actual positive expected GAAP numbers in the final two quarters of this year. Hash/Rate Growth Trends in Marathon 's recent March & April numbers speak to this improving profitability, where we witnessed the operational hash/rate continue its rise (now 14 EH/s) and the installed hash/rate climb to 17.9 exahashes by the end of April. These trends led to over a 40% spike in Bitcoin production in the first quarter alone, followed by the production of a further 700+ Bitcoin in the month of April. Therefore, with hash/rates increasing & with immersion mining now gaining traction which will result in better optimization, operational momentum is expected to continue for the remainder of the year. Suffice it to say, if these trends can indeed continue, management should be able to tackle the debt load more aggressively on the balance sheet, whilst also increasing its holdings (growing equity) over time. Bears may continue to point to the sky-high short-interest ratio as well as the bloated share count, but the risk here (from a bearish standpoint) is not to take into account the growth expectations this year which continue to impress. The almost $420 million in expected top-line sales for fiscal 2023 if met would be a 257% increase over fiscal 2022. In fact, if current trends continue (Where top-line revisions are being dialed up), a higher top-line number is the most likely outcome. Furthermore, the $0.09 EPS expectation for Q1 (if indeed met) will lead the way to positive profitability this year. Although the full-year bottom-line GAAP estimate of $0.10 per share will not turn many heads, growth stocks invariably seem to find a new lease of life when they finally can turn a profit. Furthermore, a return to strong cash-flow generation this year (forward P/C of 8.68) is a positive step in improving optimization and increasing that exahashes number as quickly as possible. Q1 Earnings Bears should not overlook these trends in that the longer and higher earnings and especially cash-flow numbers can remain elevated, the stronger the likelihood that both forward sales and earnings estimates will continue to be dialed up over time. For example, if we were to go to MARA's implied volatility chart as we can see below, we can see that the stock's IV currently comes in at approximately 122% in the forward month. Although we expect to see this number increase as we approach MARA's upcoming Q1 earnings announcement (expected on the 9th of May) and plenty of option skew continues to present itself on the call side (upside fear), IV is still trending lower than usual which points to the continuation of the trend in motion (bullish). MARA Implied Volatility Chart (MARA IV) Conclusion Marathon Digital Holdings is expected to announce its fiscal first quarter numbers on the 9th of this month where -$0.09 in GAAP earnings is the expectation for the quarter.

12355476,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529979,1683237647,"Ethereum Transaction Fees Hit May 2022 Highs, What This Means For ETH?","Ethereum transaction fees are once again hitting highs last seen since May 2022. This development has raised concerns about the impact on the Ethereum network usage and its native cryptocurrency, ETH. Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, is one of the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) platforms. The network has been experiencing a surge in activity due to the increasing popularity of memecoins such as PEPE, which has caused fees to spike. Rising Transaction Fees: A Cause For Concern On May 2, the median average transaction fee on the Ethereum network soared to around 87 gwei, according to Dune Analytics. This spike was mainly attributed to the increased on-chain activity surrounding memecoin trading, according to Hildobby, a pseudonymous data researcher at VC firm Dragonfly. Memecoins such as Pepe the Frog-themed token have been enjoying a renaissance recently, with the token price soaring over 266 times in just four days in April. The memecoin’s market cap rose to over $500 million this week before crashing below $400 million again. Related Reading: Meme Coin PEPE Hits New All-Time High As Shorts Get Rekt While this surge in activity may indicate increasing interest in the crypto market, it also highlights concerns about the network’s scalability and the impact of rising fees on users. High transaction fees can deter users from interacting with decentralized applications on the Ethereum network; as the fees increase, smaller users are priced out of the platform and its applications. Notably, the rise in memecoin trading activity, which increased the number of transactions on the Ethereum network, leading to a surge in fees, has also made decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum experience the highest level of users since 2021. Dune Analytics data shows that Ethereum-based DEXs saw a surge in volume, with the total trading volume on these platforms surpassing $63 billion in April alone. This represents a significant increase from March, when the total trading volume was around $31 billion. What This Means For ETH It is worth noting that the rising transaction fees on the Ethereum network are seen as a disadvantage to the value of ETH, as users may seek alternative blockchains with lower transaction costs. An instance of this is the increasing interest in other L1 blockchains such as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Fantom (FTM), and so on. However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently suggested that the network could quickly scale up to 100,000 transactions per second. This could help alleviate network scalability concerns and reduce transaction fees. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Just Reversed And Signals Fresh Run To $2,000 Regardless, the increased activity may be a positive sign of growing interest in the crypto market; but it has an expensive price tagged. The rise in fees could discourage smaller transactions and lead to a decline in demand for ETH. Wwith Ethereum’s scalability improvements in the pipeline, it remains to be seen how the network will evolve in the coming months. Meanwhile, ETH price has declined 0.4% after a potential surge to trade above $2,000, last month. ETH currently trades for $1.872 at the time of writing. ETH has a 24-low of $1,855 and a 24-high of $1,919, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Regardless of the market decline, the asset’s trading volume has only ranged between $8 billion and $9 billion in the past two weeks.

42420567,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFp7,1683237145,"Bitcoin Holds Near $29K as Investors Weigh Rate Increases, Banking Contagion","Bitcoin (BTC) spent much of Thursday quietly hovering a little below $29,000, roughly where it’s stood for much of the past 10 days, as investors weighed U.S. and European central bank interest rate increases and the latest debacles in a mushrooming bank crisis.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $28,800, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. BTC slid below $29,000 Thursday morning as U.S. stock markets opened, and remained between $28,700 and $29,000.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, followed a similar pattern and was changing hands around $1,877, down 0.6% from Wednesday, same time. Prices of major cryptos moved little over the course of the day. Litecoin’s LTC token recently was trading almost flat at around $87.8 while Solana’s SOL token slid roughly 0.8% to trade at $21.70.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 0.3% for the day.  Equity markets struggled with the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, closing down 0.7% Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.  Stocks of several regional banks tanked, including those of Los Angeles-based PacWest Bancorp (PACW) dropping 50% Thursday afternoon and Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL) falling 38%. Investors fretted over bank sector contagion, which began in mid-March with the collapse of three banks, including Silicon Valley (SVB) and Signature.  PacWest is weighing its options, including a possible sale. Western Alliance denied a report that it’s for sale.  In bond markets, the note on the two-year Treasury yield – ​a gauge of near-term interest rate expectations – fell 15 basis points to 3.78%, close to its lowest mark this year. The 10-year Treasury yield also slid roughly 2 basis points to sit around 3.37%.  “The financial crisis that we seem to be sleepwalking into will almost certainly become real,” Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of decentralized layer 1 blockchain Pastel Network, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “Banks will struggle even more now given that the yield curves are so incredibly inverted,"" he said. ""And, ultimately, this will likely force the [U.S. Federal Reserve] into urgent rate cuts and a return to something akin to quantitative easing – or else the economy and the banking itself will be in deep, deep trouble."" He added that the latter scenario could buoy BTC.  Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Thursday note that BTC “isn’t seeing the same amount of flows as it did early during all the banking drama with SVB.”  “It is getting very ugly for financials and that should spell trouble for the broader economy,” Moya wrote. “Bitcoin appears anchored until it gets regulatory clarity.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/04/bitcoin-holds-near-29k-as-investors-weigh-rate-increases-banking-contagion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d50945880b441e09eabcc2c7f5d42e15a1d43898-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420570,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFsD,1683236341,Wrapping Up Consensus 2023,"CoinDesk wrapped up Consensus 2023 on Friday, marking the end of three days filled with discussions around policy, technology and scams. Catch up on some of the key stories below.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Policy Summit  The narrative  There were a lot of policy sessions at Consensus this year, including our first Policy Summit – a full day of discussions centered around regulatory issues around the world.  Why it matters  Thousands of people descended on Austin, Texas last week to talk about crypto. Here’s some of the highlights. That same week, we saw multiple Congressional hearings, follow-up work from the European Union and additional work from regulators trying to grapple with this sector.  Breaking it down  Policy issues had a day in the limelight at Consensus and showed up throughout the week in various talks.  “What's really fascinating to me about the regulatory conversation is we're seeing these discussions happen in parallel with ongoing work in Congress and other jurisdictions, lending a bit more urgency to this week's talks. It has been a very busy week,” I said last week as part of a compilation of views for CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey’s Money Reimagined column.  Here’s the thing: I’m biased. I cover policy and regulatory issues both in the U.S. and worldwide as part of my daily job.  What was also really fascinating to me is that my colleagues, who don’t necessarily have to address regulatory issues, also called out regulation as a key topic. Both Nick Baker, CoinDesk’s deputy editor-in-chief and Ben Schiller, CoinDesk’s managing editor for Consensus Magazine, mentioned regulatory issues in the same column. The other contributors included CoinDesk reg team reporters Cheyenne Ligon and Amitoj Singh.  But it is true: the regulatory issues remained front and center in many of the panels last week, including those that in theory were about anything other than regulation. How crypto companies will navigate the various jurisdictions they operate in and how they'll address concerns from regulators in the wake of last year’s various collapses are both questions we heard during the three days of panels.  There's also what I’ve taken to calling “fundamental questions.” During a Twitter space discussing Consensus last week, as well as during my opening to the Policy Summit, I mentioned that one of these fundamental questions is “will we ever get a clear delineation between what is a security and what is a commodity.”  It’s a question I asked during some of the sessions I moderated. Of course, this question has an answer if you ask regulators, say at the Securities and Exchange Commission, but mostly I’ve heard it’s a facts-and-circumstances analysis rather than a clear bright line. Will we get that clear bright line?  Another is if we’ll actually see legislation addressing crypto passed in the near future. Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chair of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, said “yes” when I asked him if a bill might be passed into law within the next year.  Other issues that came up include the upcoming election, which includes the 2024 presidential election. Obviously that’s going to be of interest, but I’m also starting to hear more and more that this may be the first presidential election with an actual crypto component (the Twitter Hack of 2020 doesn’t count).

42420563,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFo5,1683235858,"Bitcoin’s Frenzy of Activity Pushes Average Transaction Fee Over $7, Nearly 2-Year High","A spike in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain involving Ethereum-style tokens and non-fungible token (NFT)-like “inscriptions” has driven up congestion on the network, pushing the average fee rate to the highest in nearly two years while showering miners of the cryptocurrency with extra revenue.  On Wednesday, the average fee per Bitcoin transaction rose to $7.25, the highest since July 2021. For comparison, the rate so far this year had fluctuated between roughly 50 cents and $4, data from BitInfoCharts shows.  With transaction activity also surging, total fees on Bitcoin have also jumped.  Per blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin’s total transaction fees, which are paid by users to miners, jumped to around 124 BTC or roughly $3.5 million, on May 3, representing a 484% increase in the past 14 days.  “This current fee spree is an anomaly,” wrote Colin Harper, head of content at Luxor Technologies, a full-stack Bitcoin mining pool.  In recent days, a token type called BRC-20 (a play on Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard), which facilitates the issue and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, has accounted for about 6% of all Bitcoin activity since its inception in early March, according to pseudonymous analyst and yield farmer Dynamo DeFi. This year has also seen the rise of Ordinals inscriptions, which are similar to NFTs and could be images or text strings inscribed into Bitcoin-based transactions. Both activities require transaction fees.  “Inscriptions are the primary driver here,” said Harper. “Biggest difference now between this jump in transaction fees and past ones with inscriptions is that BRC-20 standard is a new way to inscribe. Adoption of this standard is driving fees up.”  “The increase in transaction volume of that token standard has driven up demand for Bitcoin blockspace,” said Jimmy Zhang, who works in the business operations and strategy department at blockchain data firm Artemis.  Kydo, vice president of Stanford Blockchain Club, told CoinDesk via direct messages on Telegram that ""Blockspace is the core commodity on any blockchain. People have found a new use case and the usage skyrocketed. BTC is more than money now."" Kydo said they only use the one name publicly because of privacy concerns.  Miners who secure and maintain the Bitcoin network are beneficiaries of the recent increase in BTC transaction fees because they are rewarded in BTC fees for processing users’ transactions.  Harper predicts the increased transaction fees currently occurring in the ecosystem are “a temporary phenomenon, though, and that transaction fees will revert back to a manageable mean soon.”  Kydo said they think the current phenomenon will last a while, ""given how much people like NFTs.""  The price of BTC has increased 1.2% in the past 24 hours to $28,884, at press time. The average transaction fee on Bitcoin is $7.25. According to data website cryptofees.info, Bitcoin’s seven-day average fee stands at roughly $2 million, second only behind Ethereum’s $12.5 million.

As a result, these assets have experienced a massive surge in value and trading volume. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Under Sell Pressure As Bears Retaliate Over the last 24 hours, memecoin PEPE saw a 53% profit while WOJAK, AIDOGE, have experienced rallies of over 20%. Over the past week, PEPE alone saw a 629% profit while WOJAK recorded a 972% profit increasing the euphoria around these assets. Memecoin Fever Triggers Euphoria The increase in the price of the memecoin sector has seen traders betting a large portion of their capital in the hopes of turning into millionaires overnight. Some achieved this goal by investing as little as $20 before the memecoin explosion. $27 $pepe wallet update: Now worth $4,240,471.20 pic.twitter.com/jsA4BIRSms — borovik.eth (@3orovik) May 4, 2023 One investor put $27 into PEPE and turned the capital into over $4 million in a few weeks as the token entered price discovery. Crypto is no stranger to these stories, but new data from Coingecko is trying to shine a bigger light on this phenomenon. The analysis team behind Coingecko attempted to reply to the following question: How much money do you need to be a Meme Coin Millionaire? On average, and taking into consideration the current trending coins (PEPE, BONK, AIDOGE), and the classic memecoins (DOGE, SHIB, Baby Doge), the study concluded: An investor would have needed $66,298.25 on average to become a meme coin millionaire, according to an analysis of 10 meme coin price returns. To reach $1 million in meme coin holdings, the minimum initial investment that is needed ranges from $11.87 for Shiba Inu, to $190,585.57 for ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE). As seen in the chart below, AIDOGE, WOJAK, and PEPE, needed the highest initial capital to reach millionaire status. As seen in the chart below, ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) required a $190,000 investment if buying them in 2023, while classical Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) needed $820 if buying in 2022 and 2013, respectively. How To Find The Next PEPE, WOJAK, AIDOGE? As these assets become mainstream, it is harder for early investors to see a higher investment return. As the chart shows, earlier investors in classical memecoins needed much less capital to reach millionaire status but much more time. In order to achieve millionaire status, an early Dogecoin investor needed 2,701 days or 7 years, while a Bonk investor needed but a week. Thus, there is an inverse correlation between initial capital and the take it would take investors to become a millionaire with these assets. Coingecko concluded: For the 2023 meme coins in particular, it is likely that Pepe, ArbDoge AI, Wojak and Ignore Fud will subsequently surpass their current all-time highs. Although they might take longer to reach higher prices, it also means that a lower initial investment is needed to become that meme coin’s millionaire. In the crypto industry, trends, and sectors can lose popularity and gain overnight. In that sense, finding the “next big thing” is challenging.

The company reported an adjusted loss of $0.34 per share, compared to an analyst estimate for a loss of $1.45 per share and a narrowing from Q4’s loss of $2.45 per share.  Trading volume came in at $145 billion versus analyst estimates of $147.7 million for the quarter. Trading volume was roughly $146 billion in the fourth quarter.  Shares of Coinbase were up about 8% to $53 in after-hours trading Thursday. Shares are up about 40% this year with bitcoin’s rise of roughly 74% year to date.  “This is the fourth crypto cycle that Coinbase has been through and we've emerged stronger after each one,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in a statement sent to CoinDesk. “We've shifted the business to operate more efficiently in this down market driving positive adjusted Ebitda in Q1.”  Investors have been particularly interested in Coinbase’s recent unveiling of its derivatives exchange in Bermuda, which is part of the company’s expansion outside the U.S., because it could have a positive impact on revenue coming from fees. The initiative comes as regulators crack down on crypto companies in the U.S.  “The goal here is to get into the derivatives market in a more pronounced way and better serve the international customer base,” Anil Gupta, chief investment officer at Coinbase, told CoinDesk. “It’s really early days so we’re not expecting a big financial contribution in the near term, but it’s something we’re super excited about in the coming quarters.”  Out of the U.S.-based crypto companies, Coinbase is one of the most active advocates for clearer regulation in the country. During an earnings call in March, Armstrong said that he would be spending more time in Washington, D.C., because policy is his top priority in 2023.  “America is in a position to lead in crypto and help update the global financial system,” Coinbase said in a letter to shareholders. “We need crypto specific rules, rather than regulation by enforcement, to help this innovative technology flourish and for America to maintain its leadership position.”  While the company is very much focused on international expansion, including in Canada, Brazil and Singapore, its U.S.-based operations remains the core business, Coinbase said.

Bitcoin Market Is Observing A Moderate Distribution Phase Currently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the behavior of the largest BTC whales has once again deviated from the rest of the market. The relevant indicator here is the “Trend Accumulation Score,” which tells us whether Bitcoin investors are buying or selling. There are mainly two factors that the metric accounts for to find this score: the balance changes taking place in the holders’ wallets and the size of the investors making such changes. This means that the larger the investor making a buying or selling move, the larger their weightage in the Trend Accumulation Score. When the value of this metric is close to 1, it means that the larger holders in the sector are accumulating right now (or a huge number of small investors are displaying this behavior). On the other hand, the indicator has a value near the zero mark suggesting the investors are currently displaying a distribution trend. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? This indicator is generally defined for the entire market but can also be used on specific investor segments. In the below chart, Glassnode has displayed the data for the Bitcoin Trend Accumulation Score of the various holder groups in the market. The value of the metric seems to be red for most of the market right now | Source: Glassnode on Twitter Here, the investors in the market have been divided into six different cohorts based on the amount of BTC that they are carrying in their wallets: under 1 BTC, 1 to 10 BTC, 10 to 100 BTC, 100 to 1,000 BTC, 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, and above 10,000 BTC. From the above graph, it’s visible that the Trend Accumulation Score for all these groups had a value of about 1 at the bear market lows following the November 2022 FTX crash, suggesting that the market as a whole was participating in some heavy buying back then. This accumulation continued until the rally arrived in January 2023, when the market behavior started shifting. The holders began distributing during this period, selling especially heavily between February and March. Following this sharp distribution, the rally lost steam, and the price plunged below $20,000. However, these investors once again started to accumulate as the price sharply recovered and the rally restarted. Though, this time, the accumulation was only moderate. Interestingly, while the behavior in the market had been more or less uniform in the months leading up to this new accumulation streak (meaning that all the groups had been buying or selling at the same time), this new accumulation streak didn’t have the largest of the whales (above 10,000 BTC group) participating. Instead, these humongous investors were going through a phase of distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Up After Fed Rate Reveal, Correlation With Stocks Over? Since Bitcoin broke above the $30,000 level in the middle of April 2023, the investors have again been selling, showing moderate distribution behavior. Like the accumulation phase preceding this selling, the above 10,000 BTC whales haven’t joined in with the rest of the market; they have rather been aggressively accumulating and expanding their wallets. These holders seem to have decided to move in the opposite direction of the general market. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,900, up 1% in the last week.

SDIG will operate 2,000 A1346 (110 terahash per second per miner) and 2,000 A1246 (90 TH/s per miner) miners supplied by rig maker Canaan ( CAN ), with a total hash rate capacity of 400 petahash per second. Under the terms of the deal, Stronghold ( SDIG ) will get 50% of the bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) produced by the miners and get payments from Canaan ( CAN ) equal to 55% of the net cost of power at the company's Panther Creek plant, in dollar-per-megawatt-hour terms, calculated on a monthly basis. The A1246 miners will be installed by May 15, and the A1346 miners are to be installed a month later. All 2,000 A1246 miners are currently on site and ready to be deployed, said SDIG, one of the many miners that got stung by falling BTC prices and rising energy costs. With a ~$15M investment, Stronghold ( SDIG ) has procured around 22K miners since last August with mining capacity of ~2.2 exahash per second, Chairman and CEO Greg Beard said. ""We achieved this through opportunistic purchases of Bitcoin miners in a distressed market and through unique hosting agreements where we retain exposure to Bitcoin mining economics and power upside, consistent with our vertically integrated business model,"" he said.

12352179,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529956,1683226832,"US Regional Bank Failures Trigger Bitcoin Surge, $30,000 Level In Sight","Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of reaching the $30,000 milestone, but regional banks in the United States face significant anxiety and fear. Investors are concerned about the potential for contagion following the recent struggles of PacWest, a California-based lender. The bank’s shares have plummeted by as much as 60% overnight, causing it to reassure investors and confirm that it is in talks with potential partners and investors about a deal, as reported by The Telegraph. Despite insisting that it has not experienced any unusual deposit flows, regional bank stocks are down by more than 5% today, with not one of the 349 banks in the sector seeing gains. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Under Sell Pressure As Bears Retaliate Regional Banks Take A Hit, 130 Stocks Down Over 5% The fears surrounding regional banks are undoubtedly fueled by the recent failure and sale of First Republic Bank to JPMorgan Chase. This high-profile event has highlighted the potential risks and challenges facing smaller banks, particularly in the current economic climate. Despite the broader concerns in the financial sector, Bitcoin has climbed above the $29,000 level, up by 1.7% in the last 24 hours, potentially fueled by the ongoing concerns surrounding the US banks. This suggests that there may be some investors who are turning to alternative assets as a potential hedge against the risks and uncertainties in traditional financial markets, which have shown no signs of relief for the short term. Furthermore, according to CryptoCon, a Bitcoin market analyst, the accurate BTC bull market is here. This is based on the mid-line crossover of the 3 Week Keltner Channels, a technical indicator measuring volatility and trend in Bitcoin. When BTC crosses over the mid-line, currently priced at $26,500, it is a strong signal that a bull market has begun. Additionally, CryptoCon notes that historically, Bitcoin has not returned under the mid-line after crossing, supporting the argument that a bull market is underway. According to the analyst, this has been true, as the crossover has consistently brought months of bull market activity. Bitcoin On The Rise As US Bank Failures Mount Daan Crypto Trades, a cryptocurrency market analyst, has analyzed Bitcoin’s dominance and potential impact in the broader cryptocurrency market. According to the analyst, Bitcoin dominance, which measures the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization made up of Bitcoin, is currently trading at its range highs at the 48-49% area. Daan suggests that if Bitcoin can push through this range and make new local highs, it could move toward 52% or higher. This likely leads to continuing the ongoing trend of Bitcoin dominance, which has increased in recent months. However, the analyst notes that if Bitcoin remains range-bound between $27-30K, it could lead to a recovery in ALT/BTC pairs, seeing Bitcoin dominance come down. This would suggest that altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin, could outperform Bitcoin in the short term. Related Reading: Coinbase And Ripple CLOs Meet, Will XRP Listing Follow? When writing, the top cryptocurrency in the market is trading at $29,000. In the past 24 hours, there has been a total liquidation of $100 million in short positions.

Bitcoin was trading at about $28,900, roughly where it has stood most of the past 24 hours, while ether was hovering near $1,900. Jobless claims rose by 13,000 to 242,000 last week, slightly surpassing expectations of an 11,000 increase in claims.  In comments Wednesday following the U.S. central bank’s decision to raise interest rates 25 basis points, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the “gradual cooling” of labor markets demonstrated the economy’s resilience and may foreshadow an economic soft landing instead of a much-feared recession.  In what many observers of monetary policy viewed as a slight shift, Powell also noted that a decline in wage growth “to a more sustainable level” would help alleviate inflationary pressures.  Wages and their growth cadence will likely play a significant role in the Federal Open Market Committee’s evaluation of economic conditions, and the merits of future rate increases.  BTC traded along its 20-day moving average, with a narrow trading range that spanned 2.3% from low to high. BTC momentum sits at neutral levels with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 51. The BTC RSI is slightly above its 20-day average of 50, but giving little indication of moving higher at the moment.  Ether is trading just below its 20-day average, exhibiting slightly less strength than BTC, while trading in a similarly narrow range. Since April 21, ETH's price has increased 2% versus a 6% increase for BTC.  ETH’s RSI of 50.19 exceeds its 20 day-moving average of 48.01, and has accelerated by 10% since April 21. The difference in pace between ETH’s increased price versus the RSI does not indicate a divergence, but that additional upside exists for the asset.  A divergence between price and technical indicators generally occurs when they are moving in opposite directions.

42420557,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFcj,1683225505,The Reactionary Political Theater of CBDC Bans,"Florida has essentially banned the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in the state, and its regional neighbor, North Carolina, as well as several other U.S. states, seem likely to follow soon. This is a major legal advancement in what’s largely been a rhetorical battle: The U.S. government, as it stands, is “looking into” CBDCs but it is still far from, if ever, actually deploying the largely misunderstood technology.  As the 2024 election cycle heats up, CBDCs – a broad term covering a number of ways to “digitize” fiat currencies, which will not necessarily use blockchain or see use by average citizens – have become a flash point. Political critics, largely but not exclusively Republicans, have argued that a “digital dollar” would be a financial privacy nightmare, a tool that empowers the state while exacerbating existing issues with financial inclusion.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Over 100 countries are researching CBDCs, but only 11 are deployed, according to the Atlantic Council. There are several studies pretty far along, including a two-year project from the European Union, a multinational initiative in the Middle East called Project Aber and, perhaps most worryingly to U.S. pols, China’s “digital yuan,” which debuted to the world during the last summer Olympics, among dozens of other on-going proof-of-concepts and pilot programs.  What all of that research has revealed is … complicated. There are legitimate risks associated with CBDCs, and theoretical impacts that could reshape the financial sector as we know it. A “retail” CBDC, for instance, essentially a checking account kept at the Federal Reserve that any U.S. resident would be entitled to use, would compete against private banks and credit unions, numerous studies have found.  Would that really be bad? At least on my end, I’m a proud supporter of broad, universal programs that provide people access to stuff – whether that’s governments setting aside land for the “public good” or systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum that do something similar for finance. More to the point, CBDCs would be large systems where the full range of outcomes is not currently understood.  That hasn’t stopped people from saying definitively that a theoretical CBDC’s risks outweigh the benefits. Circle, the stablecoin issuer, has come out strongly against them. So has Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a possible Republican presidential candidate, who will soon have the chance to pass into law the bill he proposed to Florida legislators banning CBDCs in the state.  See also: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Proposes Law to Ban CBDCs  While a statement from Circle is very much worth considering – the company has as large a financial incentive to oppose CBDCs (which could compete with its USDC token) as well as a reason to rally behind them as a potential technology provider for global CBDC development – the political theater from actors like DeSantis is truly regrettable.  Last March, the Biden administration announced its intention to “assess the benefits and risks” of central bank digital currencies, joining dozens of other initiatives around the world. This being America, and DeSantis being the opportunistic politician he is, the Florida governor almost immediately proposed a law to “prohibit” CBDCs in the state. A number of similar initiatives soon followed (including a media event from Texas Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, being the opportunistic politician that he is).  And this being America, where the political process bogs down anything useful but expedites the most dysfunctional laws, these state legislative bans of CBDCs are coming to pass. Many in crypto will see this as a win, having convinced themselves that all statecraft is the Devil’s work. But I urge humility and ask for patience, not only because the verdict isn’t out on CBDCs but because the laws that are being proposed and introduced may end up doing more harm.  North Carolina’s representatives are going to block the state from participating in potential CBDC experiments. So when did research become a bad thing? Florida literally redefined what “money” is to exclude CBDCs. While the Bitcoin Policy Institute has praised DeSantis’ action in particular, it also published a report stating all this anti-CBDC fervor may end up impeding the industry’s growth by introducing poorly written rules or causing politicians to reject pro-crypto reforms.  This is to say nothing of the latent sinophobia in many CBDC critiques, which often says a digital dollar or digital euro would be used as a tyrant's tool because CBDCs have more-or-less become synonymous with the digital yuan, a topic my colleague Emily Parker explored in a recent article. Or the idea that CBDCs might prevent the types of “financial censorship/replatforming” that critics predict, precisely because a CBDC may be subject to constitutional protections that banks do not have to follow.  See also: If Money Is Speech, CBDCs Should Be Tools for Freedom | Opinion  In the end, CBDCs may not be advisable in the U.S. or elsewhere. But that’s something countries should decide on after considering the evidence. The only thing worse than political theater is being forcefully stuck as a character in someone else’s stupid ass political play.  CORRECTION (MAY 5, 2023 – 21:20 UTC): The article originally stated only two CBDCs have launched, based on out-of-date information from the CBDC Tracker's chart.

42420561,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFkz,1683223411,Liquid Staking Platform Lido Surpasses 6M Ether Deposits as Shanghai Upgrade Spurs Inflows,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Lido Finance has surpassed six million ether (ETH) deposited on its liquid staking platform amid steady inflows following the Ethereum blockchain’s Shanghai upgrade.  Lido has enjoyed a net inflow of 105,644 ETH through last week, worth some $199 million, pushing deposits to 6,008,480 ETH, according to blockchain data by a Dune Analytics dashboard.  Liquid staking has become a popular way for investors to earn yields on their digital assets, making it one of the largest DeFi sectors with $16 billion of value combined, per data by DefiLlama. Liquid staking platforms, including Lido allow users to keep their locked-up tokens liquid with a derivative token that can be used for lending and borrowing.  The rapid expansion of liquid staking catapulted Lido to the top spot in DeFi, with some $12 billion of assets on the platform.  Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which allowed withdrawals from staking contracts starting April 12, has accelerated the growth of liquid staking for ETH. Blockchain data shows that many crypto investors have withdrawn previously locked-up tokens and decided to reinvest them using liquid staking protocols, CoinDesk reported.  While Lido is still the top liquid staking protocol by far with a 79% market share, according to Nansen, it is facing increased competition from up-and-coming players. Rival platforms Frax Finance and Rocket Pool have enjoyed net inflows of $367 million altogether.  In contrast, centralized exchange giants Binance and Coinbase, which also offer liquid staking with their own derivative tokens, have endured heavy deposit outflows. The two exchanges experienced more than $700 million in withdrawals as of Tuesday.  Lido has not yet activated withdrawals, pending the release of its version (v)2 protocol upgrade expected later in May. Given the nature of liquid staking, users who want to withdraw from the platform can just sell their stETH derivative token on exchanges. As the token’s price tracks closely to ETH’s, Lido likely isn’t facing significant withdrawal pressure, Kunal Goel, an analyst at crypto research firm Messari, wrote in a report Wednesday.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | RPL | FORKS,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/04/liquid-staking-platform-lido-surpasses-6m-ether-deposits-as-shanghai-upgrade-spurs-inflows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acc1ea6b0c4c3d6c8b4f243400a3e5f6113014ce-5740x3822.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
12351101,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529884,1683223222,"SUI Gets A Bear Introduction On Day 2, Will Sell Pressure Continue?","Yesterday marked a new dawn in the crypto industry as the SUI Layer 1 blockchain launched on Mainnet with its hyped native token SUI. The news of the token launch on major exchanges brought excitement to the crypto community, and SUI did not disappoint as its native token rallied massively, recording over 2,000% in the first hour of listing. The layer 1 blockchain token was seen to hit the $2.16 mark at the time of its launch and listing on exchanges before it retraced due to selloffs. However, while crypto investors have been drawn to the opportunities and price potential a layer 1 blockchain token can offer, SUI has temporarily failed to continue its price rally on day 2 of its listing. Bears have sent a welcome message. SUI Token Price Falls Short On Day 2 The Sui layer 1 blockchain token has experienced a price decline in today’s trading session after a significant rally that followed its launch and listing yesterday on major exchanges. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Price Shows Vigor, Are Bulls Up To Something? According to trading data reports from Coingecko, the native token, which trades at $1.33 at the time of writing, is on a negative 38.46% from its 24-hour all-time high of $2.16. Bears are seen to take over in today’s trading session as the token struggles to hold the price on its red candle on the daily timeframe. Why Is The Ethereum Killer Falling In Price The recent price decline of the layer 1 blockchain token may be attributed to selloffs from holders and traders who took part in the SUI recognition sale. Weeks earlier, before the mainnet and token launch, SUI had announced a community access program to enable its community members to receive its native tokens in the “early phases of the network’s life.” Instead of carrying out airdrops as rewards, the SUI Foundation proposed a recognition sale for its user champions and network supporters. Community members and users eligible for the recognition sale were reported to have met specific requirements as stated by the foundation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rips Above $29,000, But Why Is The Mean Transaction Size At A 3-Year Low? Eligible community members were required to register on a participating exchange, which would then notify them via email on how to purchase the allocated SUI tokens. Bybit, a participating crypto exchange for the recognition sale, made available 1,500 SUI tokens at a unit price of $0.03 for each eligible user purchase. At this price, each eligible user purchased and received allocations of 1,500 SUI tokens at a total price of $45 before the public listing on May 3, 2023.SUI, upon launch, rallied massively, and at a high of $2, crypto traders who participated in the recognition sale made around $3,000 from their $45 investments. As it is with airdrops and community recognition sales, the price of the reward token is subject to temporary retracements and price dumps due to selloffs and users cashing out their rewards. While SUI may experience selling pressure, it is important to note that the hype surrounding it is very much active as some call it the Ethereum killer and, as such, may recover in price. Bitcoin’s price movements also have a major role and effect on the price direction of many altcoins, including SUI, and may dictate if selling pressure continues.

42420556,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFgr,1683222601,"Judge Upholds Freeze on SpartacusDAO's $35M in Lawsuit Served Via Discord, NFT","A federal judge is keeping the freeze on $35 million in crypto assets held by SpartacusDAO, a crypto investment project whose leader faces a lawsuit from disgruntled investors in its SPA token.  Judge Victor Marrero upheld his previously signed restraining order against Wei Wu, allegedly the man behind Spartacus, in a hearing in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York on Thursday. Marrero said the order will remain in place until Wu, who has been a no-show, starts to work with the court, said Diogenes Casares, CEO of the investment company suing Wu.  The courtroom decision marks the latest chapter in a multimillion-dollar battle over the future of SpartacusDAO and SPA tokens.  SPA investors unhappy with the progress of the crypto yield project staged a vote last year to dissolve the decentralized autonomous organization and return its value to token holders. But Spartacus has ignored their non-canonical proceedings – the vote did not occur on SpartacusDAO’s traditional governance platform – and pressed on.  Amid all this, Patagon Management LLC, a proprietary crypto trading firm, alleges Spartacus wronged investors by holding Wu's own token redemption program that he front-ran for $4.3 million in profit. In its lawsuit against the DAO leader, the prop trading firm also alleges violations of securities laws and shareholder obligations.  Serving Spartacus Discord  Late last month, a lawyer representing Patagon informed Spartacus, whom they identified in court papers as Wei Wu, of a lawsuit with legal papers posted to SpartacusDAO’s Discord server, the project’s town hall. Within minutes the post was deleted and the lawyer was banned, according to court documents.  The back-and-forth highlights the challenges and also opportunities of conducting legal business in the crypto’s digital native realm, where defendants are more easily located on Twitter, Discord and governance forums than the meatspace.  “Especially in the crypto space, people have to take what they can get, and if the only manifestation of a party that wronged you is via a Discord server, well, that’s where you have to go” to serve them, said Nelson Rosario, an attorney who works in crypto.  SpartacusDAO is a crypto yield project and Ohm fork on the Fantom blockchain whose treasury has attracted activist investors who seek to redeem their SPA tokens for the treasury’s underlying assets. According to Patagon, Spartacus has absolute power over the treasury and is ignoring governance token holders' demands. Last year he staged – and front-ran – his own token redemption program, but is now ignoring a community vote to hold another.  Leader gone AWOL  Spartacus “basically dropped off the map last year. And we couldn't find a location” to serve him at, Casares told CoinDesk in a phone interview. He said he connected the pseudonymous Spartacus to the real world identity Wei Wu by cross-checking a variety of internet records.  After private investigators came up cold and a notice served over email yielded no response, Casares said his team turned to Discord as a last resort. If Spartacus not only ignored but deleted the notice there, he said, then perhaps he could be held in contempt of court.  “It’s the same way that if you serve someone, put the letter on their doorstep with a giant thing saying ‘this is a legal letter,’ and then they throw it out – that's contempt of court,” he said.  Indeed, the letter was deleted and neither Spartacus nor Wu has formally responded to the allegations. Patagon’s lawyers pulled out another legal trick Wednesday and attempted to serve the defendant via a non-fungible token (NFT).  Wu did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/04/judge-upholds-freeze-on-spartacusdaos-35m-in-lawsuit-served-via-discord-nft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e801d9d3c26c146f6d320087ddaebe52b104cacc-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For example, financial-services firm Prime Trust had started working with crypto exchange Binance.US to store its customers' cash with Prime Trust's network of banking partners, the newspaper said. Firms like Prime Trust essentially act as an intermediary between their banking partners and clients so that crypto firms can gain access to dollars and other fiat currencies needed to pay employees and fund other expenses. Binance.US previously used Signature Bank ( OTC:SBNY ) as one of its fiat banking partners, until the regional lender failed in March. Silvergate Capital ( SI ), another crypto-friendly bank, also collapsed two months ago amid the fallout from the failure of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) and the Federal Reserve's most aggressive tightening campaign since the 1980s. In recent weeks, Binance.US has reportedly found a new partner for direct lending. “There are still a lot of banks willing to bank crypto, but there’s now more concentrated risk,” Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of U.K.-based BCG Group, told the WSJ . His company is seeking to add bank partners in the U.S. to help crypto firms in the country gain access to bank accounts. At the onset of the banking turmoil, the Journal reported that some smaller-sized banks extended welcomes to crypto-focused companies as they scrambled for banking services.

However, the price is trading sideways and there might be a modest recovery next week as investors take advantage of this dip to acquire more DOT. According to CoinMarketCap, Polkadot ranks #11 among all cryptocurrencies with a current market price of $5.75. Polkadot’s 24-hour trading volume is up by 29.40% in 24 hours, while its market cap has also gained 1.57% within the same time frame. Polkadot’s (DOT) Fear & Greed Index today is 46. This level indicates that bulls are pushing the price up gradually, but the bears are still in their positions. Over the last few days, Polkadot (DOT) has been showing some bullish signs; so expect a possible recovery within the next few weeks as investors take advantage of the current momentum. DOT Price Analysis Polkadot trades between the 200-day simple moving average and the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). This indicates that the market is in a neutral or consolidation phase. The price does not trend significantly in either direction. During this phase, traders and investors may use the 50-day and 200-day SMAs as support and resistance levels while trading. Related Reading: Check Out This Shocking Pepe Coin Versus Bitcoin Comparison However, if the price exceeds the 50-day SMA, it could indicate a short-term uptrend, giving investors a buying opportunity. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) level of DOT is 41, indicating that its market is heading towards the neutral zone and there’s indecision among investors. But the 24-hour volume indicator shows that the trading activity is gradually growing, which could mean investors are building interest in the coin. This may increase liquidity and potential price movement in favor of DOT. The chart above shows the key support and resistance levels of Polkadot (DOT). Polkadot now trades between $5.587 and $6.07 primary support and resistance levels. DOT’s first important resistance level is $6.07. If the price rises above this level, the next resistance levels are $7.970. Future Developments For Polkadot Many upcoming developments on the Polkadot network might push its adoption, usage, and price in the nearest future. Related Reading: PEPE Goes To The Moon: Meme Coin Listed On OKX, Binance Listing In the Works? For instance, the community voted to onboard a Bridge Hub system parachain to Polkadot.

These development proposals and discussions depict the team’s effort to enhance the network’s efficiency, connectivity, and interoperability.

42420554,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqFen,1683216007,Blockchain Developer Platform Alchemy Launches Public Support for ZK Rollup Starknet,"Alchemy, which provides tools for software developers to build apps for blockchains, released a public version of its platform for Starknet – seen as a project to watch because of the combination of two hot technologies, zero-knowledge cryptography and account abstraction.  Although Alchemy's dapp store lists 39 blockchains, the company said that the Starknet integration is key because of its “fast-growing developer community” and the project’s “pioneering approach to zero-knowledge rollups.”  Starknet is a ZK rollup, which scales a main blockchain by bundling transactions and processing them for faster and cheaper on a separate one. ZK Rollups use some cryptography known as “zero-knowledge proofs,” to ensure that a transaction is valid by only showing a small amount of information about that transaction before posting it back to the main blockchain (in this case Ethereum.)  Starknet also has native account abstraction, which allows users to access blockchains via smart-contract wallets, making the experience easier.  The integration of Starknet into Alchemy’s suite could be a sign of demand from developers to build more with account abstraction. ""Alchemy makes it easy to build dapps, and Starknet provides the scale and features they need,"" said Gal Ron, a product manager and blockchain researcher at StarkWare.  “Native AA unlocks a ton of flexibility and room for innovation for wallet UX,” Alex Miao, a software engineer at Alchemy, told CoinDesk in an email. (""UX"" is short for user interface.) “Developers can incorporate customizable account permissions, build in safeguards to run at the wallet level, and create simple transaction flows. This empowers developers to build for a world where end users and businesses are always represented by a smart-contract wallet.”  Read more: Ethereum Upgrade Could Make It Harder to Lose All Your Crypto  UPDATE (May 4, 2023 18:04 UTC): Adds quote from StarkWare.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/04/blockchain-developer-platform-alchemy-launches-public-support-for-zk-rollup-starknet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f685ae664ff8bc5c0589104fca40af4818513b6b-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CLO expressed his appreciation to Ripple’s General Counsel, Stuart Alderoty, for their meeting, stating they needed to meet more often. Related Reading: AVAX Smart Contracts Hit 6-Month High – What This Means For Its Price In response, Stuart Alderoty thanked him for chatting with their legal team. After the tweet, two top lawyers in the community supported the strategic meeting, and some others called on Coinbase to relist XRP on its marketplace. Ripple And Coinbase OfficlainsLeading The Battle, Deaton One of the notable reactions to the meeting between Ripple and Coinbase CLOs came from CryptoLaw founder John Deaton. Deaton is the attorney representing thousands of XRP holders. His response to the tweet was that the picture shows two valiant General Counsels leading the front line in battle. Further, Deaton wrote that he “tipped his cap” to Alderoty and Grewal to express his respect. By saying “frontline in battle,” Attorney Deaton reiterates his position that the crypto industry is battling with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Notably, the attorney shared a tweet to that effect in March, calling every stakeholder in the industry to meet and share strategic ideas to win the war. Related Reading: Top 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week Amid US Banking Crisis Following the recent tweet, the two firms battling SEC’s lawsuit may have listened to Deaton’s suggestion. Another prominent figure that responded to the recent development was the Australian-based lawyer Bill Morgan. The lawyer stated that teamwork against a common foe is the best strategy to win. However, Morgan further said he doesn’t regard Coinbase as a friend of XRP holders as it “ceased secondary market trading in its exchange.” Crypto Users Call For XRP Relisting Other responses following the recent tweet were calls for Coinbase to relist XRP. A Twitter user going by Jon Mann, who responded, asked Coinbase to relist XRP, stating that the meeting is the tag team the Ripple community has been waiting to see. Another user XRPcryptowolf also supported the call maintaining that Coinbase should relist XRP if they need Ripple’s help beating the SEC. There has not been any mention of why the parties met yet. However, the crypto space still hopes for a favorable summary judgment that will bring regulatory clarity for XRP.

42420585,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqIRB,1683213213,CoinDesk Turns 10: The Legacy of Mt. Gox – Why Bitcoin’s Greatest Hack Still Matters,"“Hi everyone, I just put up a new Bitcoin exchange,” Jed McCaleb wrote on the Bitcoin forum. “Please let me know what you think.”  This was in 2010. The new exchange was called Mt. Gox.  On Mt. Gox’s first day of operations, 20 bitcoins (BTC) were traded. They each sold for 5 cents.  The origin story is now legendary – it almost feels like a fable. The roots even go back to elves and dwarves. McCaleb, as all students of bitcoin history know, had created the site years earlier as a place to geek-out on the fantasy card game “Magic: The Gathering.” He wanted to buy and sell cards. So he launched “Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange,” or Mt. Gox for short.  This feature is part of our ""CoinDesk Turns 10"" series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history.  Back then, it wasn’t easy to buy bitcoin. Some early enthusiasts would barter the “coins” (as they were called then) for things such as T-shirts and Visa gift cards. As then-software developer Kolin Burges remembers, to purchase bitcoin he’d use a clunky workaround that involved buying “Linden dollars,” the digital currency from Second Life. “It was a disaster,” Burges says now. In one $5,000 purchase, he lost 40% of the value because of a lack of liquidity.  When a Canadian we’ll call Greg first tried to buy bitcoin, he was so confused that he went to a local TD Bank because he knew it converted currency. None of the tellers knew what he was talking about; they had never heard of bitcoin.  Then came Mt. Gox. Suddenly, you could just buy and sell bitcoin (or “bitcoins,” as people said then) without any major headaches. Sure, maybe the downside was that the digital currency sat on a “centralized exchange,” but was that really so risky or problematic? Isn’t it easier to just let someone else – the experts – handle the nitty-gritty of security?  So Mt. Gox grew. It grew and it grew and it grew. Despite an early hack in 2011 when it lost 25,000 bitcoin – temporarily sending the price to almost zero – eventually Mt. Gox accounted for 70% of all bitcoin transactions. It seemed that Mt. Gox was the bitcoin market.  The stolen loot from Mt. Gox is now over three times more valuable than the top 10 bank heists in all of recorded history  Along the way, Mt. Gox changed ownership. In 2011 McCaleb, frustrated with the burdens of running the site, sold Mt. Gox to a French coder named Mark Karpelès, a “chubby twenty-four-year-old” who “had tremendous difficulty with human interaction, while the logic of the computer had spoken to him naturally,” as Nathaniel Popper described him in the book “Digital Gold.”  Burges, Greg and the other 24,000 users of Mt. Gox didn’t really care who owned the exchange. They just liked that it worked. For Burges, that changed in January 2014 when, while traveling with his girlfriend in Paris for his 40th birthday, he tried to cash out some of his bitcoin(s). The withdrawal didn’t go through. Huh?  Others noticed the same thing. Daniel Kelman, a 20-something lawyer who began buying bitcoin when it cost $100, also couldn’t book any withdrawals. Mt. Gox told him the withdrawal couldn’t be processed for know-your-customer (KYC) reasons, but that explanation seemed fishy. Kelman had 44.5 bitcoin in Mt. Gox (each worth around $1,000 at the time) – a life-changing amount of money. Kelman was so anxious he couldn’t sleep. He was confused and he was pissed.  So were thousands of fellow Mt. Gox customers, especially when they read vague and unsatisfying explanations from Karpelès. In a post on Reddit, Mt. Gox stated that “it is necessary to temporarily pause all withdrawal traffic to obtain a clear technical view of the current processes.” (“Haha, the first bitcoin bank run,” one Redditor posted. “Awwww, it's growing up so fast.”)  Burges had 250 bitcoin tied up in Mt. Gox – then worth a quarter of a million dollars. He wanted them back. So he booked a flight from London to Tokyo and he staged a mini-protest outside of Karpelès’ office.  It was cold and snowing and Burges was jet-lagged, but he slapped together a sign that said “MT. GOX WHERE IS OUR MONEY?” Burges intentionally did not say, “Where is our bitcoin?” because at the time no one would know what the hell he meant.  Read more: Michael J. Casey - CoinDesk Turns 10: What We Learned From Reporting a Decade of Crypto History  Burges soon met a reporter from The Wall Street Journal and a reporter from a new website that had begun covering the crypto space – CoinDesk. Burges’ protest soon gained more attention and became one of bitcoin’s early crossover stories into mainstream media.  The Japanese onlookers, meanwhile, seemed bewildered by the protest as 1) Burges didn’t speak Japanese and 2) no one had heard of bitcoin. But this didn’t deter Burges. He patiently waited for Karpelès to show up to work and when he did, he confronted him.  “Do you still have everyone’s bitcoins?” Burges asked Karpelès in the snow, who awkwardly carried an umbrella and iced coffee.  Karpelès had no adequate answer for Burges, and he had no adequate answer for the other 24,000 Gox customers. Eventually, the hard truth emerged: Mt. Gox had been hacked. The bitcoin was gone. It seemed that nothing was left. ""We had weaknesses in our system, and our bitcoins vanished,” Karpelès said at a Tokyo press conference in February 2014, where he announced Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy. “We've caused trouble and inconvenience to many people, and I feel deeply sorry for what has happened.”  750,000 bitcoins were stolen.  This was roughly 7% of all the bitcoin that existed at the time. At present market value of roughly $30,000 per bitcoin, this tallies up to a crime of over $22 billion. Mt. Gox isn’t just the largest hack in crypto’s history. The stolen loot from Mt. Gox is now over three times more valuable than the top 10 bank heists in all of recorded history.  But the wildest part of Mt. Gox? The legacy is as relevant in 2023 as it was in 2014; the hack helped shape the crypto industry; and now, somehow, nearly a decade later … the story has a final surprise twist.  Not your keys  In the aftermath of the hack, other heavyweights in the space – no dummies – quickly distanced themselves from the odor of Mt. Gox, stressing that the exchange was the blunder of one bad actor and not a failure of bitcoin. Sound familiar?  “This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company’s actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry,” Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, Jesse Powell of Kraken, and the heads of several other exchanges wrote in a joint statement. “As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we’re seeing today.”  You can swap out Mt. Gox for “FTX” and this is a carbon copy of what crypto advocates have been saying about Sam Bankman-Fried.  Mt. Gox, to many, embodies the original sin of the crypto space: putting too much trust in centralized exchanges. To them this is a lesson that should have been learned in 2014, but it’s a mistake that still haunts us in 2023. “The legacy of Mt Gox is ‘not your keys, not your coins,’” says Caitlin Long, a longtime bitcoin advocate and founder of Custodia Bank. Long, who was a Mt. Gox customer, regrets trusting a centralized institution and now says that “it was the cheapest tuition I’ve ever paid to learn a critical life lesson.”  Roger Ver, who had once lent a hand to help Mt. Gox during the 2011 hack, says nearly exactly the same thing. “Not your keys, not your bitcoin,” says Ver when asked for Mt. Gox’s core lesson. Peter McCormack, host of the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast, offers an identical takeaway from Mt. Gox: “Not your keys, not your bitcoin.”  Then McCormack offers a second takeaway. He notes that in the carnage of Mt. Gox, the price of BTC collapsed and it seemed to many that bitcoin was done. As tech reporter Kevin Roose wrote just after the hack, “The Bitcoin dream is all but dead.”  To his credit, Roose has since recanted. (“Hoo boy, did I blow it,” he followed up in 2017.) And bitcoin, of course, did not die. You could argue that it grew stronger. Less fragile. When you look at the past 13 years of history that includes Mt. Gox and Silk Road and FTX, says McCormack, “the fact that it’s still here is its strength. It’s very hard to kill a blockchain.” Even in the worst-case scenario where bitcoin itself is hacked, or it becomes banned in the United States, says McCormack. “I guarantee you that the next day people will be moving it around and it will have a price.”  The hack of Mt. Gox didn’t just fail to kill bitcoin, it led to certain improvements and innovations in the space. In part because Mt. Gox’s collapse had left customers in the cold – in the protestor Burges’ case, the literal snow and cold – Japanese authorities strengthened the regulations of crypto exchanges. JP Koning argues that because of this Mt. Gox-inspired regulation, “Japan was the safest place to be an FTX customer.”  The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is the juiciest unsolved mystery in the crypto space, but the question of who hacked Gox is arguably the runner-up  The hacker’s success at Mt. Gox led to a hardening of security measures. Jed McCaleb’s original exchange, after all, was designed with orcs and goblins and magic missiles in mind – not billions of dollars in assets. Security was lax. Steve Walbroehl, a crypto security expert, teaches classes on Web3 security and his syllabus includes a section on Mt. Gox. The failings of Karpelès’ exchange, says Walbroehl, led to advancements in both “technical controls” (such as extra password security like two-factor authentication) and “administration controls,” such as KYC mandates and a certain amount of collateral that an exchange needs to hold in reserve.  As for the exact details of how the hack happened, while the U.S. Department of Justice later fingered a Russian crypto exchange runner named Alexander Vinnik for laundering Mt. Gox’s stolen bitcoin, the exact cause and culprit of the hack is “still a mystery,” says Walbroehl. (The prevailing view by many in the space is that while Karpelès was sloppy and perhaps even negligent with safeguarding the Mt. Gox data, he was not the mastermind and did not act with malice. Karpelès was found guilty in court for manipulating data, but not for embezzling or hacking funds.) So who’s the real villain here? The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is the juiciest unsolved mystery in the crypto space, but the question of who hacked Mt. Gox is arguably the runner-up.  And there’s one more mystery of Mt. Gox that has long cast a shadow over the space. Weeks after Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and all of the bitcoin had vanished, Karpelès made a startling discovery. He had found an old bitcoin wallet. That wallet contained 200,000 bitcoin, which he thought had been stolen. For perspective, this one tiny wallet contained nearly 1% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist. Think of the Goonies discovering One-Eyed Willie’s treasure, and now imagine not just a single pirate ship but instead an entire fleet.  Kelman, the young lawyer who had lost 44.5 bitcoin in the hack, had been obsessively following the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. And when Karpeles discovered that stash of 200,000 bitcoin, says Kelman, “everything changed.”  End of the rainbow  What happened next is convoluted and confusing and took nearly a decade to sort out. “The crazy thing about Mt. Gox is that it took place in Japan, but almost none of the creditors are in Japan,” says Kelman. “No one knew what was going on.” For perspective, when you look at the crypto legal intrigues of today – Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, FTX – you can easily access court documents in the United States. “That didn’t exist in Japan,” says Kelman, who was not formally involved in the legal case. “There’s one set of physical documents. It’s in a room. You have to go to that room in the Tokyo District Court and you have to speak Japanese and you have to be a creditor.”  Put yourselves in the shoes of the Mt. Gox creditors. They were livid and they wanted answers. A bitcoiner who goes by the alias “Django Bits,” at the time a Swiss photo editor, first bought bitcoin in 2011 when it cost around 30 cents. He had 20 bitcoins in Mt. Gox, worth around $20,000 at the time. He set up a Telegram group for fellow creditors to swap stories, commiserate and keep track of any developments in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case.  Keeping track was hard to do. “We’re looking at these weird documents coming from Japan. And things kept dragging on,” says Django. With Karpelès booted from the exchange, a Japanese attorney named Nobuaki Kobayashi was appointed by the court as Mt. Gox’s trustee. He was charged with distributing any remaining assets to the creditors.  But what exactly were those assets worth? In 2014, before the hack, each bitcoin was worth around $1,000. Post-hack, the price crashed to below $500. At one point, the trustee’s plan was to liquidate the 200,000 bitcoin and then divvy up the cash to the creditors … with the price pegged to $483.  Kelman and the other creditors had a different idea. What if they could get back their bitcoin, as opposed to a cash payout? “It would be a message to the whole world that bitcoin was money,” says Kelman, who occasionally visited the Tokyo courtroom to view the documents and then leak them to the community. Kelman believed in bitcoin. He had attended weekly meetups in Tokyo’s Roppongi district where they had convinced a few bars to accept bitcoin for beers. To Kelman bitcoin was money. If the Gox payout to creditors was paid in bitcoin, that would help validate their underlying thesis.  Meanwhile, the Gox bankruptcy case – which was later changed to a “civil rehabilitation” case – dragged on and on. Complicating matters was a lawsuit from an early bitcoin exchange called CoinLab, where founder Peter Vessenes claims he had an early agreement to purchase Gox. And over the years, a who’s who of bitcoin notables drifted in and out of the Mt. Gox scene. Brock Pierce tried to launch “Gox Rising” as an alternate resolution path for creditors. Craig Wright claimed to own the wallet that contained over 79,000 of the stolen bitcoin.  And Karpelès himself has popped up from time to time, at one point even wading into Django’s creditor group Telegram to answer questions and face the music. (Django even credits Karpelès for warning the group that they were at risk of having their bitcoin – at the time worth well over $1,000 – of being liquidated at $488. The creditors wrote concerned letters to the trustee and averted that outcome.)  Even Django, who runs the creditors Telegram group, struggles to follow every twist and turn. He describes the current state of play, the “Civil Rehabilitation Plan,” as a 102-page document that’s written in Japanese. “There’s a 17-page English document but it says that the translation is for ‘reference purposes only,’” Django says with a laugh. “It always says that the Japanese version is the binding one.”  Happily, that 102-page Japanese document does appear to have one important takeaway: The creditors will soon get back their bitcoin, or at least a chunk of it. The creditors will receive roughly 21% of the bitcoin they lost at Mt. Gox, plus a matching amount of bitcoin cash (BCH), which was created during the “fork wars” of 2017.  In a normal settlement, a paltry 21% payout might feel profoundly disappointing – no one’s happy with a 79% loss. But nothing about bitcoin is normal. Even though the current crypto climate is often characterized as a “bear market” with “low” prices, today’s prices (about $30,000) are roughly 30 times higher than they were during the Gox hack ($1,000).  The Mt. Gox creditors were some of the earliest believers in bitcoin. The exchange might be gone but they are still here, still HODLing, still believing.  Greg had 14.7 bitcoin in Mt. Gox; he’ll get back roughly 2.2, as well as 2.2 bitcoin cash and some actual cash. At today’s prices that will give him roughly $60,000, which far exceeds the 2014 value of his 14.7 bitcoin (around $15,000). After this decade of frustration and angst he is now, suddenly, better off. His assets have quadrupled. He can use the windfall to help renovate a home he just purchased. “It’s also nice,” he says, “to have the mindset of, ‘f**k it, it’s done.’”  In theory, if Greg’s bitcoin had never been shackled at Mt. Gox and if he had perfectly timed the market, he could have sold all 14.7 bitcoin in November 2021 for $69,000 each, pocketing a cool $1 million. But that feels unlikely. What are the odds he would have held onto all 14.7 for many bumpy years and then sold at the top?  Greg, Kelman, Burges, Django and the other creditors were essentially locked into “forced HODling,” and many are now better off for it. “The forced HODL has made a lot of people money,” says Kelman, as they had no choice but to ignore the market gyrations and play the long game. For many of the creditors, says Kelman, “there’s gold at the end of the rainbow.”  As things stand now, each creditor has a choice: Receive an early lump sum that the Mt. Gox trustee will (theoretically) pay by October 2023, or wait until the CoinLab lawsuit is finalized and receive a potentially larger sum. The early payout is roughly 90% of what they could get if they wait for the CoinLab resolution, which could drag on for even more years. (A poll from the Telegram group, says Django, showed that 46% are opting for the early lump sum payment, 20% for the final, and 30% are undecided.)  Django politely pushes back on the “forced HODL” narrative, acknowledging that, yes, some creditors might be better off for it, but they did still lose 80% of their bitcoin. Fair.  If and when the creditors finally receive these long-lost bitcoin? Django ran another poll in the creditors’ Telegram group. Incredibly, Django says that only 14% would sell the bitcoin immediately, 25% would sell a portion of their total, and a jaw-dropping 50% said they would continue to HODL.  Depending on your perspective, this is either madness or inspiring. These creditors spent a decade in limbo. They thought their money was gone. Then they thought they’d only get crumbs. Now it turns out they might receive four times (in terms of comparable U.S. dollars) what they had in 2014. And thousands of them believe in bitcoin so much that they’re not cashing in a nickel.  The Mt. Gox creditors were some of the earliest believers in bitcoin.

42420572,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqICj,1683213196,CoinDesk Turns 10: What We Learned From Reporting a Decade of Crypto History,"We journalists are a privileged breed. As the saying goes, we get to write the first pages of history.  Nowhere has that seemed truer in my career than at CoinDesk. Even after 10 jam-packed years of covering its comings, goings, ups and downs, the cryptocurrency and blockchain economy still feels new, fresh and different. There is so much more of the story to come.  Still, as you read the upcoming articles on iconic past crypto events, all featured in a four-week celebration of CoinDesk’s anniversary, a pattern arises that can feel counter to that high-minded, history-making ideal. It’s that often the big crypto story of the moment is one of failure.  This piece is part of our ""CoinDesk Turns 10"" series looking back at seminal stories from crypto history.  From Mt. Gox to The DAO hack to FTX, the lesson – other than that crypto has too many three-letter names with an “X” in them – might seem that this industry’s excessive dreams and greed repeatedly fall victim to gravity and to the limits of human capability.  But the articles need not be read with gloom. In fact, this pattern of failure affirms a constructive feature of the communities that are engaged around both crypto and journalism.  The crypto ethos draws from principles of open-source development, which treats failure as vital to evolutionary growth. It means that, with real money always at stake, harsh lessons are quickly encountered and processed, generating rapid iterative improvements.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - The Legacy of Mt. Gox: Why Bitcoin’s Greatest Hack Still Matters  Indeed, if you step back and apply any 10-year metric – from market capitalization (up 160,000% to $1.77 trillion) to wallets (up 56,000% to 84 million) to countries adopting crypto regulation or innovations (from none to almost every one) – this industry has grown faster than almost any in history, even if it has failed to transform the economy in the way its most ardent advocates have predicted.  The journalism ethos, at least as celebrated by journalists, embraces a similar idea. The cynical old newsroom maxim of “if it bleeds, it leads” need not be a commentary on reporters smugly delighting in the others’ pain. It can also be that uncovering failure is integral to the profession’s higher calling: to bring transparency and accountability to any human endeavor in which there is a public interest.  That mission is aligned with that of the crypto community. The more that committed journalists uncover otherwise hidden failures, the faster the industry can learn from its mistakes, adjust and get stronger.  For crypto journalists, this calling to transparency and accountability – which, admittedly, can get short shrift from large and small media outlets alike – puts a new spin on the romantic old idea that the press is the Fourth Estate.  Under that traditional construct, journalists are expected to hold governments and other agents of power to account so their pursuit of self-interest doesn’t deplete public goods in which society holds a common interest, such as security, economic well being and environmental sustainability.  In the crypto world, we have a new notion of a public good: the idea that blockchains should be free from control by centralizing special interests, whether they’re mining pools, venture capitalists, corporate exchanges or government regulators. In an ambiguous but important way, crypto journalists are called on to protect the ideal of decentralization.  Crypto’s rich quarry of stories  All media outlets are flawed, many terribly. But the best will put this commitment to protecting public goods through transparency and accountability at their core. And on that score I am immensely proud to lead a team that has upheld that standard in the face of relentless, unfounded accusations and conspiracy theories from a hostile and often toxic social media mob.  When, on April 14, our reporters Ian Allison and Tracy Wang were handed the prestigious George Polk award for stories that led to the downfall of the FTX exchange, it wasn’t just a big day for them or for CoinDesk. It mattered for crypto generally. Standing alongside reporters and editors from The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Associated Press and other titans of U.S. media, our two CoinDesk rock stars showed why it’s so important that this community expose its bad actors and strive to keep public blockchains decentralized.  CoinDesk’s 10 years of coverage uncovers the Shakespearean breadth of the crypto story  But only a few journalists get to be recognized with an award for upholding these noble objectives. What drives the rest of them? The answer is that in doing so they get the thrill of uncovering a great story.  And, boy, what stories crypto throws at us.  Some CoinDesk journalists buy into an idea I often put to journalism school graduates to entice them to join us rather than, say, a mainstream outlet: that crypto is the biggest story in finance since Florence’s Medici family created our current, bank-centric model of money during the Renaissance. Others see that as hyperbolic and – reflecting a divergence of views that makes CoinDesk stronger – are far more skeptical of this technology’s capacity to meaningfully change the world.  Yet, regardless of their views, our journalists pursue stories day in, day out, tuning out industry critics who assume they’re all “crypto shills.” That’s because those stories are inherently fascinating.  Whether crypto succeeds or not, the fact that it grapples with audacious goals of transforming a centuries-old system of money, of reimagining organizational structures and community governance, and of overturning the tyranny of Web2, makes it an endlessly intriguing subject.  Out of it emerges, not the story of a mechanical technology or the precision of math and cryptography, but of humanity itself, of its dreams, its dramas, its successes and, yes, its failures. CoinDesk’s 10 years of coverage uncovers the Shakespearean breadth of the crypto story.  History being made  Beyond the aforementioned Mt. Gox collapse in 2014, the DAO hack of 2016 and the FTX meltdown in 2022, the CoinDesk Turns 10 series offers many other chapters in this ongoing human drama.  There’s the 2015 launch of Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum – to its believers, a moment on par with Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web; to its detractors, a money grab for those who attached themselves to Buterin’s high-minded idea.  There are the block wars of 2017: either a tale of a fringe community’s destructive internecine struggle or a crucial victory for commoners – i.e., users – who protected a public good from abuse by corporate interests.  There’s the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2018, which by popular account is an example of speculative excess and loss, but can equally be seen as a story of hope for a new, inclusive capital market that was simply ahead of its time.  There’s the emergence of Facebook’s libra in 2019, which, as flawed as many saw it to be, stirred policymakers into finally realizing that crypto inventions could challenge their stewardship of the world’s core monetary institutions.  There’s the 2020 rise of crypto memes. Critics see it as a symbol of this industry’s frivolity, failing to recognize it as a remarkable expression of collective human creativity and of how new systems of communication are shaping ideas and culture.  And there’s El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, a reminder, regardless of how you feel about that move, that this technology challenges deep-set, nation-state-based ideas of money and power.  Money, power and the human struggle for creativity and independence: That’s what emerges from the opening pages of crypto history, as penned by CoinDesk these past 10 years.  What will the next 10 years hold for this technology?  Stick around and find out.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

42420574,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqIDl,1683212498,Central Bank Digital Currencies Are Unexpectedly Becoming a Presidential Election Issue,"Most Americans spend little time thinking about central bank digital currencies, if they even know what they are. For those who don’t, CBDCs are digital forms of national currencies, issued by a country’s central bank. The United States Federal Reserve has no plans to issue a digital dollar. Yet, potential presidential candidates in next year’s U.S. election are already sounding an alarm.  “Expect this CBDC issue to become a presidential campaign talking point,” said Ron Hammond, director of government relations at Blockchain Association. “Perfect intersection of fear of government, China and finance collapse with the bank crisis.”  Indeed, a number of potential presidential candidates have recently taken a strong stance against CBDCs. Opponents paint a future digital dollar as a government attempt to monitor and even control citizen transactions. A CBDC could theoretically be designed so it could be used for certain items but not others. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a likely Republican contender, suggested that the U.S. government could use a CBDC to restrict purchases of gas or prevent you from buying too many rifles.  Emily Parker is CoinDesk's executive director of global content.  DeSantis went as far as to propose legislation to ban the use of CBDCs in Florida. “The Biden administration’s efforts to inject a Centralized Bank Digital Currency is about surveillance and control,” DeSantis said in the press release. Just this week, the bill passed the Florida legislature. Then, on Wednesday, North Carorlina's House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill banning digital dollar payments to the state.  Another potential presidential candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democrat, used similar language to DeSantis' to oppose CBDCs. “We should be wary since CBDCs are the ultimate mechanisms for social surveillance and control,” he said.  Yet, another possible candidate, Republican Vivek Ramaswamy, recently tweeted, “Every GOP candidate needs a clear answer to CBDCs: hell no.”  While Kennedy’s statement demonstrates that anti-CBDC sentiment isn’t a purely partisan issue, it does appear to be an increasingly popular Republican talking point. In March, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show to explain why she vetoed a central bank digital currency bill. The video was featured in a Fox News opinion piece titled, “Politicians are quietly preparing for a digital dollar. It’s not good for your freedom.”  Other well-known Republican politicians have voiced their skepticism of CBDCs, while stopping short of proposing an outright ban. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for example, introduced legislation to prohibit the Federal Reserve from unilaterally creating a direct-to-consumer CBDC. The bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).  Expect this CBDC issue to become a presidential campaign talking point. Perfect intersection of fear of government, China and finance collapse with the bank crisis.  In February, Majority Whip Republican Tom Emmer of Minnesota introduced in the House of Representatives the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. “Any digital version of the dollar must uphold our American values of privacy, individual sovereignty and free market competitiveness,” Emmer said. “Anything less opens the door to the development of a dangerous surveillance tool.”  Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) also recently issued a condemnation of states’ legalizing CBDCs. “Governments around the world are taking steps to establish a Chinese-style, centralized currency that would give the government more control over our lives,” Davidson said.  Shadow boxing  The urgency of some of this language might give the impression that a digital dollar is right around the corner, but that is far from the case.  It’s true that more than 100 countries are exploring a CBDC, with 11 countries having already launched one. China’s digital yuan is the most famous example. But the United States has been very cautious about the idea of issuing a digital dollar, largely because of privacy concerns. The current U.S. position is essentially, we should give this more thought.  Last year, a Biden Administration executive order directed the U.S. government “to assess the technological infrastructure and capacity needs for a potential U.S. CBDC in a manner that protects Americans' interests.” Late last year, MIT and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston completed their own “agnostic” CBDC research. This year, Treasury Undersecretary Nellie Liang said that policymakers are still deliberating about whether to have a CBDC and, if so, what form it would take. “The Fed has also emphasized that it would only issue a CBDC with the support of the executive branch and Congress, and more broadly the public,” Liang said.  It is also likely that CBDC use would be intermediated by the private sector, rather than managed directly by the Federal Reserve. “An intermediated model would facilitate the use of the private sector's existing privacy and identity-management frameworks,” according to the Fed.  These statements are not enough to appease CBDC opponents, however. In April, the Federal Reserve tweeted that it has made no decision on issuing a central bank digital currency and “would not do so without clear support from Congress and executive branch, ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law.” DeSantis and others jumped on the word “ideal” to cast skepticism on the Fed’s claim.  Congress has been talking about CBDCs since at least 2021 when Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote a letter to the Federal Reserve urging research on a U.S. CBDC, said Jennifer Lassiter, executive director of the Digital Dollar Project. The Digital Dollar Project is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization devoted to catalyzing private sector research and experimentation of a potential US CBDC. “Since then the dialogue has ebbed and flowed with a more recent bump in attention as a result of proposed anti-CBDC legislation in Congress and political speeches by republican candidates,” Lassiter said.  What’s notable about the Republican opposition is that it’s not entirely clear who’s on the other side. “While it's true there’s a Republican opposition, there’s not necessarily a strong Democratic support,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center.  There are some exceptions, of course. Rep. Jim Himes (D- Connecticut) proposed a U.S. CBDC and outlined some of the benefits. But Democrats are hardly rallying around a pro-digital dollar agenda. In fact, it’s not clear if anyone really is.  “There aren’t a lot of CBDC champions. Even the Fed themselves have said, very cautiously, we’re studying it, better to get it right than get it first,” said Lipsky. A Fed paper on the topic outlined both benefits and downsides, while noting that preserving privacy was a key consideration.  So why are people getting so worked up about this now? A number of politicians with similar talking points might suggest some influence by consultants, lobbyists or other outside groups. The Cato Institute, for example, has been very vocal in its opposition to CBDCs. Cato published a paper and also polled Americans about their views on CBDCs and found that most people were unfamiliar with them. Another group that would have an interest in opposing CBDCs are U.S. stablecoin issuers. USDC issuer Circle, for one, has been outspoken about its opposition to CBDCs.  The 2024 agenda  Criticism of China, a familiar subject in U.S. presidential elections, comes up again and again in anti-CBDC talking points. “Centralized currency provides an avenue for the controlling entity to push an agenda. This is exactly what China is doing with its centralized digital currency,” DeSantis’ press secretary, Bryan Griffin, said.  While it's true there’s a Republican opposition, there’s not necessarily a strong Democratic support.  Rep. Emmer’s bill was co-sponsored by nine Republicans, several of whom directly mentioned China. “The Chinese Communist Party’s move to use government-run digital currency to impose further control on its people and its economy is a cautionary tale that America must avoid,” said Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska.  China is indeed the most visible champion of this technology. While the digital yuan is still far from ubiquitous in China, it still covers 13.6 billion RMB, 260 million wallets and 25 cities, according to Ananya Kumar at the Atlantic Council. It may not be so scary to think of a CBDC as one form of payment, co-existing alongside cash, stablecoins and decentralized cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. But China’s CBDC project is so ambitious that it’s not impossible to conceive of Beijing pulling levers to incentivize citizens to primarily rely on digital yuan.  China’s Central Bank has claimed that privacy is an important consideration for its digital yuan. But extensive reports of Chinese surveillance have led to skepticism in this area.  It is extremely unlikely, of course, that a theoretical digital dollar would be identical to a digital yuan. And some would argue that China’s ambitions should light a fire under Washington, D.C. Digital Dollar Project co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Giancarlo, a speaker at CoinDesk’s Consensus festival, argues the U.S. has an opportunity to lead with a digital currency that protects privacy rather than encourages surveillance.  It’s not just China, of course. DeSantis’ criticism of CBDCs goes hand in hand with larger criticism of the Federal Reserve and of the Biden administration in general. “The track record of the establishment throughout [COVID-19] and under this administration speaks for itself and leaves plenty of room for concern,” Griffin, DeSantis’ press secretary, said. He also pointed to Canada, mentioning the freezing of bank accounts of Canadian protestors during the so-called Freedom Convoy in February 2022.  DeSantis also depicted CBDCs as an example of Davos elites backdooring “woke ideology” such as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investment frameworks into the U.S. financial system.  War of words  While the CBDC issue is likely to come up in the 2024 presidential campaign cycle, it is hard to imagine it becoming a central issue. It is even harder to imagine even a single American voter casting a ballot based on this issue. But that doesn’t mean the political debate won’t have a discernible effect. The most immediate impact could be on research.  “Experimentation and innovation is happening around CBDC with U.S. companies,” Lassiter of the Digital Dollar Project said. But “perhaps the sharing of the results of that experimentation is limited and slowed in a politically divisive environment. Innovation is continuing, the question is whether companies are willing to lead on experimentation for a U.S. CBDC if there is political disagreement about the need for research at all.”  “It’s very important to be cognizant and work diligently on the privacy issues,” said Lipsky of the Atlantic Council. “I hope that this discourse doesn’t have a chilling effect on the Fed’s research.”  At the very least, raising CBDCs to the level of national politics will bring more Americans into the conversation. Even if some of the digital dollars discussed on the campaign trail will bear little resemblance to anything that would ever exist.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/04/central-bank-digital-currencies-are-unexpectedly-becoming-a-presidential-election-issue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12aadf777b36dc32a0cd75e657cfee15fdcd5e22-1893x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This price drop comes despite the fact that its trading volume increased by over 26% in the last 24 hours. ADA has now lost its earlier gains in the past week, dropping from $0.4028 on April 29, 2023, to $0.3974 on April 30. Currently, it is trading in the $0.3926 range. Its past price behavior suggests it will likely recover from the bearish trend. Fortunately, Cardano retains most of its gains in 2023, moving from $0.248 on January 1, 2023, to its current price of $0.3922 at press time. ADA Price Analysis ADA is experiencing price volatility today, forming a red candle on the daily chart.

The approval occurred in a May 3 Federal Executive Council meeting. Blockchain Adoption Could Impact The Economy Positively Notably, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim, had presented a memo about the regulatory framework earlier. While announcing the approval, the FMCDE cited a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report predicting the increasing blockchain adoption and how it will boost the global gross domestic product by 2030. It noted that the global GDP could gain an additional $1.76 trillion from various industries representing about 1.4% of the world’s GDP. Related Reading: AVAX Smart Contracts Hit 6-Month High – What This Means For Its Price In October 2020, the country released a draft of the blockchain adoption strategy. The document mentioned decentralized ledger and blockchain technology would support the growth of the Nigerian digital economy. The FMCDE developed the national policy by consulting stakeholders in the private and public sectors. The creation of the policy conforms to the seventh pillar of the national digital economy policy and strategy, with the major focus of the policy being on growing global innovative technologies and digital society. Importance Of The New National Policy The main purpose of the new policy is to create a blockchain-based economy suitable for digital activities in the country. It will ensure secure transactions, value exchange, and data sharing among individuals, companies, and the government. Also, the policy will impact the public and private sectors in the country positively. Blockchain adoption strategy in Nigeria cuts across several pathways and initiatives. These include the establishment of a consortium for blockchain, fostering digital identity, and developing a national blockchain sandbox for piloting and testing. Related Reading: Top 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week Amid US Banking Crisis Also, the strategy will involve the creation of blockchain business incentive programs, advancing digital awareness and literacy of blockchain technology, and building a robust regulatory and legal framework. While FMCDE will supervise the policy initiatives, the coordinating responsibility lies on the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA). A multisectoral committee has also been created to oversee policy implementation. Further, several regulatory bodies will be putting in some regulatory regimes for implementing blockchain technology in many sectors of the economy. The Federal Executive Council appointed some bodies, such as the Central Bank of Nigeria, NITDA, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Nigerian Communications Commission, and the National Universities Commission for using blockchain technology in different sectors for the betterment of the economy.

The 2,000 A1246 and 2,000 A1346 miners will provide a total capacity of 400 petahash per second (PH/S), according to an emailed announcement on Thursday. The A1246 miners will be installed by May 15, while the A1346 miners will be installed by a month later.  Stronghold has procured around 22,000 miners since August with capacity of 2.2 exahash per second (EH/s) at a cost of $15 million, CEO Greg Beard said.  ""We achieved this through opportunistic purchases of Bitcoin miners in a distressed market and through unique hosting agreements where we retain exposure to Bitcoin mining economics and power upside,"" Beard said.  As part of the two-year hosting agreement with Canaan, Stronghold will receive 50% of the bitcoin mined and retain any upside of selling power back to the grid, should the company elect to curtail the usage of the machines to do so.  Like its peers across the mining industry, Stronghold spent 2022 in a squeeze between falling bitcoin prices and exorbitant energy costs.

The fundraise will help drive zkLink towards its mainnet launch in the third quarter.  Crypto venture capital funding rode the bull market of 2021 off a cliff as the bear market and post-scandal turbulence hit. Still, infrastructure projects proved to be resilient, and noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz highlighted the promise of zero-knowledge (zk) technology in its recent annual report on the crypto industry.  The race to launch zk-based technology has started to intensify. Polygon and Matter Labs announced in March the mainnet launch of dueling zk-EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) offerings within days of each other. For zkLink, the company will launch a community campaign called “Odyssey” and the “Dunkirk” asset withdrawal test ahead of its own mainnet launch.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  ""ZkLink plays a crucial role in shaping the future of the crypto landscape by leveraging the potential of ZK technology,” co-founder Vince Yang said in an email to CoinDesk. “For newcomers to the field, envision a scenario where [decentralized finance] DeFi trading delivers comparable user experience, efficiency and speed as centralized exchanges, but also provides the advantages of being trustless and non-custodial.”  ZkLink is built around zero-knowledge rollups, an Ethereum scaling approach that mathematically proves the validity of an off-chain transaction to save time, throughput and fees. The company’s decentralized trading layer connects layer 1 blockchains and layer 2 protocols. Developers can use its application programming interfaces (API) to create a wide range of products, including order book decentralized exchanges and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, among others.

12347238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529822,1683210043,"Bitcoin Up After Fed Rate Reveal, Correlation With Stocks Over?","Bitcoin has surged above the $29,000 mark following the Fed rate hike of 25 bps, a sign that the asset may be decoupling from the stocks. Bitcoin Has Jumped Despite Fed Interest Rate Hike Announcement According to the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the cryptocurrency market has shown some promising rise potential since the rate hike announcement has gone live. In the past year, the US Federal Reserve System (“Fed”) interest rate hikes have generally been met with panic in the market, as coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have suffered significant hits to their prices following them. This has been because the sector has experienced a high correlation with the US stocks during this period, meaning that the prices of the assets in the two sectors have been moving in a similar fashion. Recently, however, things have been changing for the better, as the cryptocurrency and stock markets have become increasingly separated. The initial reaction in the prices of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to the latest announcement has also been a positive indication of this. Here is the comparison between BTC, ETH, and S&P 500 that Santiment posted one hour after the FOMC meeting: Looks like BTC didn't move much following the event | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, S&P 500 fell shortly after the rate hike, while BTC and ETH remained steady, showing the disconnection between the two sectors. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have risen in the hours since then, breaking the $29,000 and $1,900 levels, respectively. This could be a sign that investors are at ease now that the meeting is behind them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally May Not Have Hit Top Yet, Here’s Why “At least for now, it seems that the initial reaction to this interest rate hike was: “At least it’s over with now. Crypto no longer needs to worry about fiscal policy until June,” notes Santiment. On-chain data also shows that the trading volumes of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap have trended up since the meeting, an indication that activity has been increasing in the sector. BTC's price has trended up since the announcement | Source: Santiment Another indicator, the “active addresses,” which measures the daily total number of unique addresses that are taking part in some transaction activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, has also observed a surge following this Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting day, as the below chart highlights. The indicator's value has been going up during the past day | Source: Santiment This metric provides an estimation of the total number of unique users that are using the network right now, so its value going up suggests a high amount of traffic has visited the chain during the past day. The latest spike in the Bitcoin active addresses is the highest seen in the last two weeks, with the one from two weeks ago being mostly due to a sharp plunge in the price.

This incredible surge in burn rate is causing many to speculate that a price reversal may be on the horizon, as the token’s value continues to experience significant volatility. As the burn rate of Shiba Inu continues to soar, the cryptocurrency’s fate remains uncertain, leaving investors and enthusiasts alike wondering what the future holds for this meme-inspired token. Will Shiba Inu be able to maintain its momentum and reach new heights, or will the current volatility lead to a dramatic price u-turn? Related Reading: AVAX Smart Contracts Hit 6-Month High – What This Means For Its Price Shiba Inu Burn Rate Climbs, Signaling Potential For Price Reversal Shiba Inu, the popular cryptocurrency inspired by the Shiba Inu dog breed, has experienced an astonishing 30,940% surge in burn rate at the time of writing, according to Shibburn’s data at the time of writing. But what exactly does “burn rate” mean in the context of cryptocurrencies? In simple terms, the burn rate refers to the amount of tokens that are permanently removed from circulation. When a cryptocurrency “burns” tokens, they are essentially destroyed, which can have the effect of increasing the value of the remaining tokens. In the case of Shiba Inu, the massive surge in burn rate is an indication that more tokens are being removed from circulation than ever before, which could potentially lead to a supply shortage and a subsequent increase in value. Based on the data presented, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is experiencing exponential growth in the number of total transactions, resulting in a significant transfer of 2,254,093,318 SHIB tokens to inactive or “dead” wallets overnight. SHIB total market cap at 5.8 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Top 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week Amid US Banking Crisis The sudden transfer of tokens to dead wallets is believed to be a response to the rapid surge in transaction activity within the ecosystem. The data highlights two specific addresses that were responsible for a large portion of the transaction volume. One address was used to “burn” 2,005,265,274 SHIB tokens, effectively removing them from circulation permanently. The other address burnt 246,743,138 SHIB tokens, contributing to the overall reduction in circulating supply. Where Shiba Inu Stands Right Now At the time of writing, the price of SHIB on CoinMarketCap stands at $0.00001005, with a 24-hour rally of 0.83%, while experiencing a decline of 2.37% over the last seven days. Despite the massive surge in the burn rate of Shiba Inu tokens, the price of SHIB has shown little movement. Source: CoinMarketCap One possible explanation is that the market has already priced in the impact of the burn rate, and therefore, the current token burn rate is not enough to move the price significantly. Another factor could be the current market conditions, which have been unfavorable to many cryptocurrencies, including Shiba Inu. Furthermore, the sheer number of SHIB tokens in circulation could be another contributing factor to the price stagnation. With a circulating supply of over 394 trillion SHIB tokens, any changes in the token burn rate would need to be substantial to affect the overall supply and demand dynamics of the market. -Featured image from Picography",NEUTRAL,AVAX | SHIB,AVAX | ICO | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-burn-rate-explodes-31000-will-price-heat-up-as-well/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/12346677.jpeg

But the Mean Transaction Size, based on the 7-day moving average, is at a 3-year low, according to Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm. Bitcoin’s Mean Transaction Size Crashing The Mean Transaction Size relays the average transaction size over a given period. It can be used as a lead to gauge the level of activity. Typically, the higher the demand for BTC, the better the prices. Considering the decentralized nature of public networks, including Bitcoin, transactions are packed in blocks before being confirmed and added to the longest chain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market in Disarray, But Optimism Prevails With Two Narratives The size of each Bitcoin block is fixed at 1 MB; therefore, the number of transactions that can be packed in a block directly depends on the size of each transaction. On average, BTC transactions can be between 300 and 400 bytes. Coupled with the set transaction processing time of roughly 10 minutes, transaction sizes, and by extension, the block size cap, directly impacts the network’s throughput. A notable observation is that the mean transaction size in Bitcoin has been rapidly falling over the past few weeks. There was a sharp expansion from late January 2023 when the mean transaction size rose from around 590 to 1,195 in mid-February. It then see-sawed in the following weeks, falling from 1,192 in late March to 820 in early April. It crashed to 467.949 on May 2, the lowest in three years. 📉 #Bitcoin $BTC Mean Transaction Size (7d MA) just reached a 3-year low of 467.949 Previous 3-year low of 468.425 was observed on 02 May 2023 View metric:https://t.co/PJ0bkLTuVs pic.twitter.com/WNZE2VmaOM — glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) May 4, 2023 Blame The Ordinals The initial expansion in late January could be attributed to the launch of the Bitcoin Ordinals platform. The portal allows individuals to attach files, including texts, images, and videos, to Satoshis. Afterward, these files are stored in Bitcoin blocks after being confirmed by miners. Because each file is unique and exists as a transaction, every Ordinal stored in a Bitcoin block has been compared to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), though they are not technically NFTs. And Dune data shows that over 3.5 million inscriptions have been added to the Bitcoin network. However, while the number continues to rise, there is a marked shift in the types of files attached. In the early days of the Bitcoin Ordinals, there were more images, which were bigger than texts and other files, such as audio or applications. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Regains Strength Post Fed Hike, $30K Could Be Next Over the months, this has changed, and there are more text inscriptions.

On Tuesday, Coinbase ( COIN ) introduced its crypto derivatives exchange in Bermuda , through which institutional users based in eligible jurisdictions outside the U.S. can trade perpetual bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) futures, as regulatory scrutiny of the industry heated up in the U.S. The company secured a license toward the end of April to operate in Bermuda.

42420582,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqIO5,1683205200,OpenTrade Raises Over $1.5M for Building Crypto Structured Financial Products,"OpenTrade, provider of on-chain structured financial products for Web3 treasuries and businesses, has raised just over $1.5 million in a funding round led by crypto-native venture capital firm Sino Global Capital.  Other backers in the funding round included Circle Ventures, Kronos Research, Kyber Ventures, Polygon Ventures, and Outlier Ventures. The capital will help OpenTrade scale its operations ahead of the launch in the second half of this year.  The initial products will include liquidity pools for U.S. Treasury bills, investment-grade commercial paper and investment-grade supply chain financing. Tokenized access to traditional finance products, such as the short-term U.S. debt obligations backed by the government, have grown in popularity as a way to tap into the crypto market while managing volatility amid a protracted bear market.  The decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol platform is built on Circle’s DeFi and payments infrastructure and runs on Polygon and Ethereum.  How it works  Founded earlier this year, London and Palo Alto-based OpenTrade utilizes a global network of financial institutions and business-to-business (B2B) networks to create on-chain liquidity pools with specific investment criteria, underlying assets and target yields, according to the company website. Assets backing each pool are held in a bankruptcy remote structure by a regulated custodian in segregated accounts to help mitigate risks.  Users can deposit USDC stablecoins or euro coin (EUROC) from their wallets into the OpenTrade liquidity pools. In exchange, the user receives an ERC-20 token representing a pro rata claim on the net asset value (NAV) of the pool and its underlying assets. To withdraw, a user can redeem the liquidity pool tokens for the equivalent amount of USDC or EUROC, an amount that will include a pro rata share of the principal and accrued interest.  Financial backing  The OpenTrade founding team includes CEO Dave Sutter and Chief Commercial Officer Jeff Handler, who previously worked at Centre, the consortium co-founded by Circle and Coinbase to govern USDC. The team also includes Michele Bisceglia, who was previously a partner at advisory and asset management firm AgFe.  As part of OpenTrade’s formation, Bisceglia and adviser Steve White launched Five Sigma, a dedicated structured finance and investment advisory firm that was spun out of AGFE to manage OpenTrade’s off-chain operations.  Five Sigma currently has over $700 million in assets under management and advisory.

42420578,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqIKz,1683205200,Layer 2 Network Optimism to Use Ethereum Attestation Service to Promote User Trust,"Optimism, an Ethereum-based layer 2 companion blockchain, will be using Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), an on-chain attestation protocol to enable users to assess the trustworthiness of the platform’s users and vouch for whether something actually happened on the blockchain, EAS said in a press release sent to CoinDesk.  This could promote fairer OP token distribution and community voting systems on Optimism, according to the release.  Any Optimism user can use the technology to attest to information that they believe is accurate, such as whether a person built, or contributed to, a particular project, whether an individual makes profitable trades or not, and more.  EAS’ launch aims to enable Optimism users’ to allow them to verify on-chain content that could sway how the platform’s native OP tokens are distributed and how users interact with one another more broadly.  “We're trying to be a base layer where identity platforms can exist, where supply chain companies can attest to supply movements, and provenance, where governments can attest to land registries and entities can vote,” EAS co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Steve Dakh told CoinDesk.  The team said the technology will allow developers to create innovative identity products across Optimism, and other networks such as Base, Polygon and Ethereum.  Such a service could include products such as an aggregated rating system for decentralized finance (DeFi) users’ reputations that could assign an individual a reputation score based on other users’ attestations of their interactions with that individual.  The technology can also support the work of the Optimism Collective, an entity that rewards the ecosystem’s contributors with crypto, by providing the group with the information it needs to distribute OP tokens to community members who have positively contributed to the blockchain, Zain Bacchus, senior product manager of ecosystem at OP Labs, told CoinDesk.  This will incentivize developers to build critical infrastructure on Optimism and pursue other projects that improve users’ experiences within the ecosystem.  “People in the Optimism Collective have been kind of trying to figure out, ‘hey, how do we actually identify one person – and not just like any person, but like a positive contributor to the space – to give these tokens to’ and that's when we started experimenting with attestations,” Bacchus said.  Using EAS, users can also post a publicly accessible, on-chain record of how the collective distributes tokens. This could allow on-chain analysts to more easily understand who is receiving OP tokens and for what purpose, promoting transparency across the entire ecosystem.

42420580,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqIIv,1683204300,Estate and Legacy Planning for Crypto Assets,"Despite the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S., investment and adoption of crypto assets is not slowing down.  The U.K., European Union, UAE and Southeast Asia have all enacted legislation concerning crypto assets and decentralized finance participation. U.S. investors, both individuals and businesses, remain interested in and continue to invest in and use blockchain-based systems.  This continued movement toward crypto opens up opportunities for financial advisors to guide clients, even if those advisors cannot or choose not to recommend or manage crypto assets.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  The growing importance of crypto assets in estate planning  More clients than you think own crypto assets in some form. Some may use a custodian, such as Coinbase or Kraken, and have accounts with four to five figures of bitcoin. Some may have been spooked by the failures of several custodians and decided to move their assets onto hard wallets or into cold storage, adhering to the “not your keys, not your crypto” mantra.  As we continue to witness the creation of new accounts and new wallets every day, it’s apparent that more investors are moving some fiat into crypto. These investors now require some guidance in establishing an estate and legacy plan for their crypto assets, even if they believe they have the custody portion all figured out.  Younger investors are often the ones diving deeper into crypto without informing their spouse or family members or educating them on the nature of crypto custody. They may not consider themselves wealthy enough to warrant typical estate planning since crypto assets can be so volatile. However, proper planning is crucial to ensure their assets are passed on to their heirs according to their wishes.  How is crypto estate planning different?  Legacy planning in digital assets is different from the planning we see with traditional assets. In crypto, the technical plan is often more important than the legal plan, especially for typical investment amounts. For instance, I can create the legal conditions to ensure my daughter receives my bitcoin after I pass, but if I haven’t provided her the technical ability to control the bitcoin, the legal planning won’t matter.  Legacy planning for digital assets poses additional unique challenges, including regulatory uncertainty, cost basis considerations and rapid innovation.  Many crypto investors have yet to consider these unique aspects of legacy planning, whether their assets are held in centralized exchanges or self-custodied wallets. As we move from simply buying crypto assets to participating in on-chain protocols and holding tokenized securities, the need for proper legacy planning will only increase, creating opportunities for financial advisors to add value.  Crypto legacy planning is also important due to the potential for crypto assets to significantly increase in value in a very short amount of time. A small investment, even as speculation, can become a material value overnight.  Key strategies for effective crypto asset planning  To provide value to clients in legacy planning, financial advisors can begin by asking the following typical questions: “Do you own crypto assets?” “How are you holding those assets?” “Have you thought about what happens to your crypto when you’re not here?”  The next step would be to create an up-to-date inventory of client assets.  Centralized custodians provide application programming interfaces (API) that can feed into some reporting tools. There are also new reporting and management tools like Kubera that already have the ability to provide traditional and crypto assets in one package.  If the client hasn’t prepared to pass their crypto on, that is usually the next step. Most custodial accounts do not provide the transfer-on-death abilities, so the advisor will need to help the client make those arrangements.  If the client is holding assets in hard or soft wallets, multi-sig wallets or vaults, the advisor now has even more value to provide. Access is often more critical than legal ownership in this case, so advisors should help clients make arrangements for transferring seed phrases or private key material to their heirs. We’ve all heard the horror stories of people dying without leaving the keys to heirs.  Read more: What Happens to Your Crypto When You Die?  Education is a crucial part of the crypto legacy plan, which differs from traditional asset planning. In my case, I need to make sure my daughter understands how to use the keys I leave her and some investment philosophy behind my decisions. I don’t want her having to go to the internet and ask how to use the 24 words Daddy left behind, as that is a sure way to get scammed. I also want her to know I have a five- to 10-year time horizon and understand my plan for hodling vs. selling.  Advisors can add so much value by helping clients prepare the inventory, the technology-focused legacy plan, and the education plan for those heirs.  Estate planning challenges even for the crypto wealthy  The Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) in crypto also face unique challenges when addressing their estate planning needs. They have tax issues, which are further complicated by basis considerations and jurisdiction questions. They may have received their tokens en masse before a project launches or participated in a mining or staking program.  In addition to the typical planning needs, these clients have security issues – both personal security and wallet/funds security.  They will probably have to employ the services of a crypto-literate advisor, attorney and likely a multifamily office to provide some structure to their newfound wealth. This would involve employing some of the same structures used by the wealthy for decades but adding the custodial element. The aim will be to protect assets, engage in proactive tax planning, and preserve wealth while still allowing them and their families to enjoy it.  To maintain the tax efficiency and asset protection, they may need to do something they never thought they would utilize a centralized custodian. Except it can be in a jurisdiction like Switzerland or Liechtenstein, where they offer true custody of assets, with a structure that still allows for security of the funds and the ability to manage the assets.  Summary  Financial advisors will have a crucial role in guiding clients through estate and legacy planning for crypto assets, regardless whether their client is the typical investor or the ultra high net worth individual.  As cryptocurrencies and digital assets continue to gain prominence, it’s imperative that clients' estate plans account for these unique assets in a tax-efficient and legally compliant manner.  Financial advisors will help navigate the complex landscape of digital assets, develop tech-native strategies for wealth transfer and protection, and collaborate with legal and tax professionals to ensure the successful implementation of estate plans that accommodate both traditional and digital assets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/04/estate-and-legacy-planning-for-crypto-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24e8683bf0d1b5aa2152a4aa1ebb409fb7f582d1-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
12345510,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529821,1683204243,Dogecoin Next Big Hurdle: Barreling Past $0.50 Mark In 2023,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is now making serious waves in the investment world as the potential for its value to reach $0.50 in 2023 becomes a hot topic of discussion among crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. Despite its humble beginnings, Dogecoin’s popularity continues to soar, and its recent performance has caught the attention of many who are eagerly watching to see if this cryptocurrency can continue its meteoric rise. Let’s delve into the realm of Dogecoin and examine the route it would take to attain this significant achievement. Related Reading: Top 5 Cryptos To Watch This Week Amid US Banking Crisis From Internet Meme To Investment Sensation Dogecoin started off as a joke in 2013. But little did anyone know that it would become a phenomenon in the world of cryptocurrencies. Created by two software engineers, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, the coin’s logo was inspired by the popular internet meme of a Shiba Inu dog. Initially, Dogecoin was nothing more than a fun project for Markus and Palmer, but the coin’s popularity skyrocketed when Tesla, SpaceX, and now Twitter CEO Elon Musk tweeted about it in 2020. Musk’s tweet sent Dogecoin’s value soaring, and it has since become one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market. In fact, Musk has been a significant factor in the rise of Dogecoin’s value. His tweets about the coin have caused significant fluctuations in its value, and he even referred to himself as the “Dogefather” during his appearance on Saturday Night Live. Despite its origins as a joke, Dogecoin has become a legitimate investment option for many people. Is The Moon ‘Within Reach’ For Dogecoin In 2023? As we look ahead to the future of Dogecoin, many are wondering if the cryptocurrency will reach the much-hyped milestone of half a dollar in 2023. While it’s impossible to predict the future of any investment, Dogecoin has already defied expectations and become a legitimate player in the world of cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin’s value continues to hold steady, with the cryptocurrency trading at $0.07941 according to CoinMarketCap. Despite a small 1.13% rally in the past 24 hours, Dogecoin has seen a slight 0.48% dip over the past seven days.

After reaching an unprecedented peak of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, the value of Dogecoin has experienced a significant decline. Whether or not the cryptocurrency will be able to rebound and reach the coveted $0.50 mark remains to be seen, as it depends on a range of factors such as market dynamics, supply, and adoption. Meanwhile, according to CoinCodex’s optimistic short-term Dogecoin price forecast for 2023, the cryptocurrency’s price could rise to $0.096137 by April 25, before continuing to rise to $0.109626 by May 21. Perhaps surprisingly, its technical analysis was neutral, with 21 indicators sending bullish signals and nine sending pessimistic ones. On the basis of past trends, DigitalCoinPrice forecasted that the average price of Dogecoin in 2023 would be $0.18, while in 2024 it would rise to $0.22, and in 2025 it would reach $0.32. Based on the site’s DOGE price forecast, the cryptocurrency’s value might hit $0.94 in 2030 and rise to a possible $1.30 in 2031. -Featured image from CoinEdition",POSITIVE,ADA | DOGE,ADA | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-next-big-hurdle-0-50-mark/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42420587,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqITF,1683202903,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Pushes Above $29K After Fed Rate Hike,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin has pushed above $29,000 following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point interest rate hike on Thursday, with some analysts speculating on a strong break to the upside after over a month of trade in a narrow wedge. The move over $29,000 came a few hours after the Fed hike as a report indicated another U.S. bank failure could soon be at hand. Crypto services provider Matrixport has said that if Thursday’s rate rise proves to be the last of this cycle, bitcoin could rally 20% to $36,000. Despite trading volumes declining slightly, the “path higher sees only limited resistance,” Matrixport said in a research note on Thursday. The end of the recent earning season will see stock buybacks restart, which will “continue to be a tailwind for stocks and risk assets,” the note added.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to include a definition of digital assets in its latest hedge fund ruling, in what could have been a sign of positive intent toward clearer regulation of the crypto sector. The SEC had included the definition of assets that “use distributed ledger or blockchain technology,” in its 2022 proposal to overhaul mandatory disclosures for hedge funds, but has now pulled that wording. The agency said it is “continuing to consider this term and [is] not adopting ‘digital assets’ as part of this rule at this time.” Anne-Marie Kelley, a former SEC official and now a partner at Mercury Strategies, suggested the commission may have deleted it as “any recognition of digital assets’ uniqueness weakens their litigation stance that digital assets are securities.”  The WallStreetBets token (WSB), which is linked to the WallStreetBets subreddit, dropped 90% in the last 24 hours following a big run higher that had seen its market cap jump to $50 million in under three days. The plunge came after one of the insiders connected to the project, @zjzWSB, dumped a large amount of tokens in return for 334 ETH ($635,000). Blockchain sleuth @ZachXBT flagged the transactions on Twitter, which seemed to trigger the mass selling, bringing about the 90% crash. Users had previously received an airdrop of nearly seven ether worth of WSB tokens for simply pasting their crypto wallet addresses on Twitter. This helped the tokens go viral on Crypto Twitter, forming part of the ongoing meme coin frenzy, which has also spawned the likes of PEPE.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows U.S. recession probability based on the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's preferred indicator, the so-called near-term forward spread – which tracks the difference between expected yields on three-month Treasury bills in 18 months and the current three-month yield.  The probability has surged to 94%, the highest ever, surpassing the peaks seen ahead of the coronavirus-induced crash, the sub-prime crisis and the dot-com bubble.

According to Coingecko data, the frog token has risen to become the third most popular meme coin, behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), with a market cap now at $688.5 million, leaving FLOKI behind. In the ranking of all cryptocurrencies, PEPE is now ranked #73, while FLOKI is ranked #123 ($332.5 million market cap). Remarkably, PEPE initially retreated to $0.0000008383 yesterday, but since then the price has skyrocketed more than 112% at times, hitting a new all-time high at $0.000001794. The brutal price move is likely due to a short squeeze, as tweeted by the data tracking platform Laevitas. Pepe shorts adding more fuel to the fire. pic.twitter.com/mdcS1n60iQ — Laevitas (@laevitas1) May 4, 2023 Funding rates are a measure of the payments that futures traders have to make to keep their positions open. If the funding rate is negative, it means that traders with short positions are required to pay the funding rate to traders with long positions. The opposite is true for positive funding rates. PEPE’s funding rates were extremely negative before the short squeeze. This means that short positions were dominant, which showed the dominance of bearish positions in the derivatives market. Meanwhile, the spot market was strong. Related Reading: Check Out This Shocking Pepe Coin Versus Bitcoin Comparison Often, however, the market tends to do the unexpected. When the overwhelming majority is bearish, it is easy to wipe out liquidity, especially for larger players or market makers. This is especially valid for smaller coins with low liquidity and a comparably small user base. PEPE still only has 80,000 total addresses. Trader @htltimor added that some shorts are being chased like there’s no tomorrow. “It’s fun (and was extremely predictable),” says the trader, who shared the chart below and shared another piece of advice: You can *sometimes* try the stochastic < 20 on new coins in a lower TF (i.e. 1h) and if it coincides with RSI oversold and logical levels and patterns and volume profile, you can take a punt. Did not do that myself, as I don’t trade meme coins. Another factor for the gigantic price increase could be investor psychology. NewsBTC analyst Tony Spilotro says: This is what price discovery is like in crypto. The reason we see it more in fresh newly hyped coins is there aren’t really any bag holders at a loss yet looking to dump at every rally. So they just hold and hold and price go up. Related Reading: PEPE Goes To The Moon: Meme Coin Listed On OKX, Binance Listing In the Works? At press time, PEPE was trading at $0.000001673. As NewsBTC reported, PEPE is still waiting for a listing on Binance. During a recent AMA, CEO Changpeng Zhao said that the listing process on Binance is “dictated by user interest.” So if the trend continues, it should only be a matter of time before PEPE is listed on Binance and experiences the obligatory “Binance pump.” Investors should ask themselves, however, if this could be the top signal for the meme coin.

Chronos, which launched on April 27, is a so-called (3,3) exchange, using staking as a primary resource for accruing value to its token to achieve store-of-value status. The (3,3) paradigm was made famous by Ethereum-based Olympus DAO – one of the most prominent projects of the previous crypto bull run.  Some liquidity pools on Chronos are paying as much as 2,300% to liquidity providers (LP) in the form of chr (CHR) tokens, which can be used to vote on protocol changes. LPs are entities that provide two different tokens to a decentralized exchange’s smart contracts, netting a cut of the fees charged by the exchange on each trade.  Holders can restake these tokens to earn additional fees, retain voting power and ensure a liquid marketplace for other projects that may look to borrow capital from Chronos.  Such yields are rare in the crypto market, which may explain the sudden rush of capital to Chronos.

42420584,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqIQ9,1683200612,North Carolina House Unanimously Votes to Ban Digital Dollar Payments to the State,"North Carolina's House of Representatives on Wednesday unanimously passed a bill prohibiting the state's agencies and institutions from accepting payments in central bank digital currencies (CBDC).  Representatives voted 118-0 (with two excused absences) in favor of the bill, in its second reading, that would prevent the state's court system or any agencies tied to the state from accepting a Federal Reserve-issued digital dollar. The bill also bans the state from participating in any pilot tests CBDCs.  While the U.S. Treasury Department has said leaders are evaluating the issuance of a digital dollar, countries including China have already run pilots, and the European Union is nearing the end of a two-year experiment into a digital euro.  But U.S. lawmakers are increasingly opposing the issuance of a digital dollar, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis proposing similar legislation to ban CBDC payments in his state. Crypto ally, and Majority Whip in the House of Representatives Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) has said CBDCs could be weaponized as a political tool.  The North Carolina bill was, in fact, introduced in early April under the title ""No Cryptocurrency Payments to State,"" and was changed to focus on digital currencies issued by the U.S. Federal Reserve in an edition filed on Tuesday.

42420583,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqIP7,1683198749,Pepecoin Funding Rates Remain Negative as Bears Proliferate,"PEPE, the self-proclaimed ""most memeable meme coin,"" has skyrocketed to more than $500 million in market capitalization in just over two weeks since launch.  Still, funding rates in perpetual futures tied to the token remain negative, indicating the dominance of bearish positions in the derivatives market.  A perpetual futures contract is an agreement with no expiration date to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price. Exchanges offering perpetual futures charge funding rates – or costs – of holding long (bullish) and short (bearish) positions to keep prices tethered with the spot market.  A negative funding rate indicates that shorts are dominant and are willing to pay longs to keep their bearish bets open. In other words, most traders expect prices to drop. A positive funding rate suggests the opposite.  Negative rates can stem from outright bearish speculation. Or they can indicate hedging activity – traders and early investors shorting perpetual futures to protect their long positions in the spot market against a potential price slide.  Hedging may be primarily responsible for PEPE's funding rates, which have been negative from Day 1, because small-cap meme tokens tend to be more volatile than market leaders bitcoin and ether, and can fluctuate greatly in a short amount of time.  While the funding rates reflect the bearish market sentiment, they also indicate scope for a short squeeze – a rally triggered by a mass unwinding of bearish short positions. The wealth of sellers in the market means prices need to move down, or the funding cost will become too burdensome for the bears.  According to data tracking platform Laevitas, PEPE's recent rally may have been partly driven by the short squeeze.",NEUTRAL,PEPE,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/04/funding-rates-in-the-500m-market-cap-pepe-token-remain-negative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb70fb0a5a96033e994120e4c51ddbde71d6d806-483x272.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company's auditor has identified multiple material weaknesses. In addition to large losses, the company has issued large amounts of stock over the past three years. A Tough Scene Bitcoin, and crypto in general, has had a difficult twelve months. Despite the crypto rally that kicked off 2023, many of the largest-name coins are still trading in the red on a trailing twelve month basis. Koyfin Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are all down double digits. Crypto exchanges are also facing, well, headwinds: from the blowup of FTX, to declining exchange volume ( click here to read our article on the topic ) and SEC troubles at Coinbase ( COIN ), overall trust and trading volume in the crypto universe has been dented considerably. The past two years has also seen electricity prices rise considerably. Consider the following table from the Bureau of Labor Statistics : Bureau of Labor Statistics Since 2021, average prices for electricity per kilowatt hour [KWH] have spiked dramatically. This is expected to fall somewhat this year , but the electricity markets are highly volatile and, of course, forecasts don't always go as planned. Against this backdrop, miners of cryptocurrency (particularly Bitcoin) have had a difficult go. After all, it isn't easy to turn a profit when the asset you mine is falling in value and one of your biggest input costs is going through the roof. In this article we will consider Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ), a Bitcoin mining company which we think is poorly positioned to perform well in the coming months. Let's dive in. Accounting Troubles To say that 2022 was a bad year for Marathon would be an understatement. For one, the company announced in February 2023 that its prior financial statements from 2022 and 2021 could no longer be relied upon, and that it would be issuing a restatement of the affected quarters in its 2022 10K. Unfortunately, the warning signs were present well before February 2023. In the company's 2021 10K , Marcum LLP issued an adverse opinion (page 51) on the company based on a material weakness in the company's internal controls over financial reporting. Marcum explained that ""[a] material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis."" This opinion was expressed, again, in 2021. In 2022, things do not appear to have gotten better. In the most recent 10K, in fact, Marcum changes its wording of 'weakness' from singular to plural, which is most troubling. In addition to the previously noted weakness regarding internal financial controls, Marcum added this on page 106 of the 2022 10K : The Company had a material weakness related to the application and interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles primarily in the areas of consolidation, impairment of digital assets, disposal of property and equipment, and principal versus agent considerations in revenue recognition. In other words, Marcum did not eliminate their original material weakness--because Marathon apparently didn't correct it--and added a new one which appears to be the material weakness that led to the restatement of the company's 2021 and 2022 financials. Adverse opinions are things investors want to see. To see one go uncorrected for a year and then have a new material weakness uncovered is... not good. 2022 Results Against the backdrop of falling cryptocurrency prices and rising electricity costs, one would expect that the financial results from Marathon would be less than stellar in 2022, but we think that would be an understatement. Company Filings Total revenues fell 26% year over year, from $159 million to $117 million, while the cost of revenues (looking at the energy and hosting line, in particular), jumped a massive 165% from $27 million to $72 million. In this regard, of course, the company cannot be blamed. It is a mining business, after all, and just like anyone who mines anything, the value of the asset being mined along with input costs can fluctuate wildly. What is not so understandable are the company's enormous impairment of mining equipment and its advance to vendors ($332 million) or its full of deposits due to the vendor bankruptcy of Compute North ($24 million). This sea of losses led to the company reporting a net loss of $686 million for 2022. The company, presumably in an effort to generate fresh capital against these losses, has been a prolific seller of stock over the last three years. Koyfin From 2021 to 2023, Marathon has sold $229 million, 313 million, and $361 million worth of stock, respectively. This--in conjunction with stock based compensation--has helped to boost shares outstanding from under 10 million in 2020 to over 160 million today. The Bottom Line Details on these results would be nice to have, but the company appears to not have held a conference call for its 2022 earnings. While one can debate the future of Bitcoin, or Bitcoin mining generally, we believe that the above issues should give investors--at a minimum--a high level of concern about the state of Marathon. From the existence of not one, but two identified material weaknesses by the company's auditor, to the large issuance of stock and enormous losses the company has posted, we believe investors should be extremely cautious if considering Marathon. As for us, we opt to avoid it altogether.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4599828-marathon-digital-look-out-below?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12343538.jpeg

At least six blockchain networks are on track to be launched in the coming months, adding to the more than 50 layer 1 mainnets already active. In just the past two weeks both zkSync and Sui Network have started operations.  Forthcoming projects such as Scroll, Coinbase-backed Base and ConsenSys-backed Linea are gaining traction among developers. All are flush with capital to fund development activity and marketing, potentially cutting into the market share of existing networks such as Solana.  Yakovenko, however, remains confident in Solana's technical strengths.  “None of them are as fast as Solana, do as many transactions as Solana or run as many nodes as Solana. I think we're still quite ahead on the technology front,” Yakovenko said in a Wednesday interview on CoinDesk TV. “You've seen folks like Helium move from their own layer 1 that they've been working on. Render voted to move to Solana as well.”  Crypto connectivity project Helium kicked off its migration to Solana last month, abandoning its own infrastructure in favor of what it called a more stable home. Render, originally on Polygon, moved to Solana last week, citing faster speed and security.  The fall of crypto exchange FTX, while unprecedented, has little reason to damage the Solana ecosystem, Yakovenko said, even though FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a vocal proponent of Solana, voicing support for multiple network applications via token listings, investments and promotions.  “FTX had such an outsized kind of place in the marketplace. And they were building on Solana, they were building a lot of applications. And when they collapsed that created this massive hole,” he said. “I myself wasn't even sure. Is this ecosystem going to survive?”  Developers, however, took a longer-term perspective, he said.  “The rest of the developers that are building on Solana really had nothing to do with FTX. And you saw that in the last hackathon. We had over 800 projects submitted during that hackathon. That was our largest hackathon ever. So and that happened, basically, two months after the FTX collapse,” Yakovenko shared,  His words aren’t empty air, on-chain data suggests.

During the meeting, the Bitcoin price dropped from $28,800 to $28,250 as the market reacted to the extremely hawkish comments made by Jerome Powell. The Fed Chairman avoided confirming that yesterday’s rate hike was the last one in this cycle, despite multiple requests from journalists. He also stressed that there is no room for rate cuts this year in the Fed’s current scenarios. On the other hand, in its rate hike statement, the Fed omitted the earlier remarks that announced further hikes. Bullish 👇 https://t.co/k4DiOUwl2T — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) May 3, 2023 Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? The fact that Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are rising today is likely due to the fact that despite all of Powell’s efforts, the market is expecting a pivot, that is, a pause in rate hikes at the next FOMC meeting on June 14. The reason: In March, the majority of FOMC participants said that the final rate for this tightening cycle would be between 5% and 5.25%, which is exactly where the fed funds rate arrived yesterday. The CME’s FedWatch tool shows that an overwhelming 99.2% currently expect a pause in June. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market in Disarray, But Optimism Prevails With Two Narratives More than 85% expect the first rate cut as early as September. In total, the market currently expects at least three rate cuts (to 4.25 to 4.5 basis points) by year-end. And even JP Morgan’s Davis believes that “this is definitely the end of the hiking cycle for the Fed.” The representative of the largest U.S. bank by deposits also believes a Fed rate cut could come “as early as September.” The projections are extremely bullish for Bitcoin and crypto, as risk assets traditionally benefit the most from a dovish monetary policy as more liquidity is pumped into the financial system. On the other hand, Bitcoin investors may have once again reacted to the deepening banking crisis in the US. Related Reading: Check Out This Shocking Pepe Coin Versus Bitcoin Comparison As with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank, BTC saw a spike yesterday as Los Angeles-based PacWest (PACW) crashed by around 60% in after-hours trading. The regional bank is rumored to be looking for a buyer and considering other strategic options, Bitcoinist reported. Rumor has it that there is little buying interest, so PacWest could be the next domino. Further Upside Momentum In Sight? Further upside could be provided today by the Dollar Index (DXY) on the back of the European Central Bank (ECB) rate decision. As analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) explained, the DXY is expected to make a strong move today: 50 bps hike and dollar index should finish the day much lower. 25 bps hike and I’d expect a small bounce. The DXY continued to fall yesterday after the FOMC meeting and is currently still only just above the multi-month support at 101. If the level breaks, the DXY could face a deeper plunge, Bitcoin could benefit heavily due to its inverse correlation. A move towards $30,000 could be next if the support at $28,800 holds. However, first a sweep if the open interest seems necessary as long positions on the futures market are once again heating up (during a sideways movement).

42420586,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqISD,1683187560,Bitcoin's Dominance Rate Surges After U.S. Banking Crisis,"Bitcoin's (BTC) dominance rate, measuring the cryptocurrency's share in the broader market, has risen sharply since the onset of the ongoing U.S. banking sector instability almost two months ago.  Since early March, the dominance rate has increased from 42% to 22-month highs near 49%, indicating the top cryptocurrency's outperformance relative to the broader market, according to data tracked by the charting platform TradingView.  The SPDR S&P regional banking exchange-traded fund (ETF), which seeks to replicate the performance of an index derived from the regional U.S. banks, has tanked by 35% over the same time frame.  In March, three U.S. banks – Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank (SBNY) and Silvergate Bank (SI) – failed, triggering fears of a full-blown banking crisis. First Republic Bank (FRCB) became the latest victim of the banking crisis. To complicate matters, shares in Los Angeles-based lender PacWest Bancorp (PACW) plummeted over 60% on Wednesday.  However, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the banking sector is ""sound and resilient.""  According to Decentral Park Capital's portfolio manager, Lewis Harland, bitcoin's growing market dominance amid the banking sector instability and the slide in banking stocks is evidence of the cryptocurrency's strengthening appeal as anti-U.S. dollar play or bet on the dollar weakness just as gold and oil.  ""You see outperformance of BTC within the crypto market when regional bank share prices collapse. This signals that BTC is the high-quality, anti-dollar liquid play for investors as the crisis unfolds further,"" Harland told CoinDesk.  Expectations for renewed liquidity easing by the Federal Reserve have strengthened amid the banking crisis, signal dollar weakness ahead. On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points and opened the doors for a potential pause in June.  BTC's dominance rate is now probing the upper end of the multiyear range. A breakout would mean continued BTC outperformance, according to Harland.  ""Bitcoin dominance is looking to break its three-year oscillation pattern,"" Harland said. ""A break of 50% would likely signal a new market regime of prolonged BTC outperformance within the market.""  Bitcoin picked up after regulators Silicon Valley Bank of March 10 and has rallied 48% to $29,100 since then, CoinDesk data shows.

WSB's market capitalization had jumped to over $50 million in just under three days.  Blockchain sleuth @Zachxbt warned holders of the sales early on Thursday morning, stating one @zjzWSB had “dumped a large portion of the WSB team supply for $635K (334 ETH).”  @ZachXBT said in a separate tweet that yet another token insider called “OIP” signed these transactions that were held on a multisignature wallet – one apparently existing for the team to fund marketing and exchange listing plans.  The insider sale led to token holders dumping their holdings en masse, which contributed to the 90% price fall.  Previously, Crypto Twitter community members received an airdrop of nearly seven ether (ETH) worth of WSB tokens for simply pasting their crypto wallet addresses on @WSBmod’s tweet, one of the pseudonymous creators of wsb tokens.  This helped the tokens to quickly go viral on Crypto Twitter, where holders heralded the “official, unofficial token” as another boost in the ongoing meme coin frenzy – one that has birthed the likes of pepe (PEPE) and wojak (WOJAK), or tokens based on memes rooted in popular internet culture.  Meanwhile, @WSBMod remained hopeful of recovery and warned of legal action against @zjzWSB on Thursday morning.  ""Hey @zjzWSB , if you don't get in touch with me within 4 hours I will file a police and FBI report,” @WSBMod tweeted. “You are fully doxxed. I don't understand why you would do this.”  “You can still return the money,” he added.  Blockchain data shows none of the tokens were returned as of writing time.  In a turn of events in U.S. morning hours on Thursday, @zjzWSB alleged that @WSBMod was ""constantly, secretly"" draining tokens with airdrop that he had sent to himself.

Customers of the U.S.-based exchange who used the program – which allowed customers to borrow fiat loans up to $1 million against as much as 30% of their bitcoin holdings, with interest – received an email on Wednesday informing them that the last day to take out new loans would be May 10.  Coinbase has been under extra scrutiny from regulators following crypto exchange FTX’s collapse, and is expecting an enforcement action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over alleged securities violations.  However, the closure of Coinbase Borrow seems – at least for now – to be unconnected to any enforcement action. A person familiar with the matter told CoinDesk the closure of Coinbase Borrow had nothing to do with either pending or past troubles with the SEC.  When contacted by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for the exchange attributed the decision to reduced demand.  “We regularly evaluate our products to ensure we’re prioritizing the offerings that our customers care about most,” the spokesperson said. “Effective May 10, we will stop issuing new loans through Coinbase Borrow. There is no impact on customers’ outstanding loans, and no action is required from them at this time.”  Coinbase Borrow launched in November 2021 and was advertised as a way to get fiat loans quickly without needing to sell bitcoin, which could incur a taxable gain or loss.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,"Cheyenne Ligon, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/05/04/coinbase-to-stop-issuing-new-loans-via-coinbase-borrow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fccdcd1b1e4b69ef63f9e2b3ccbc924d82566a99-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
