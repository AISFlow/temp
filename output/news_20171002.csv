42400483,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjf8,1506976250,PBoC Advisor: 'China Was Right to Ban ICOs',"An advisor to China's central bank said he supports the recent government crackdown on domestic initial coin offerings (ICOs).  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the People's Bank of China and other regulators in the country moved in early September to restrict new offerings that utilize the funding model, through which parties can issue digital tokens that are cryptographically tied to a blockchain in order to raise funds or create a network effect for that project.  In announcing the ban, China declared the method a form of illegal financing, triggering a range of platform closures and efforts to refund investor contributions. According to Sheng Songcheng, counselor to the PBoC and an adjunct professor of economics and finance at the China Europe International Business School, the Chinese government made the right move.  Writing for Chinese-language newspaper Caixin, Songcheng – who previously said that the government should mandate disclosure standards for ICO organizers – argued that the crackdown was necessary in order to inhibit the ""chaos"" caused by unfettered finance.  He wrote:  ""I fully agree with the move to ban ICOs in China, and the calls for refunds to be made to investors. In my opinion, these actions are largely aimed at averting risk and protecting investors’ interests while also being an opportunity to further regulate trading of virtual currencies. Still, it is important for China to continue to encourage the current development direction of blockchain technology.""  Likening ICO-derived tokens to securities – a connection advanced by a growing number of regulators worldwide – Songcheng said that the push for refunds was a ""fair one"" through the lens of investor and consumer protection. He went on to suggest that regulators there could put in place new guidelines for the model so that ""everyone plays by the new rules of the game.""  In the op-ed, Songcheng called for tighter rules around bitcoin trading, though he also acknowledged that ""bitcoin is a globalized asset, and so it is hard to ban it completely."" Instead, regulators should hone in on its use for money laundering in particular.  Lastly, the PBoC advisor wrote that ""blockchain technology itself is worthy of encouragement"" from regulators, highlighting the work by companies like Alibaba in this area as examples that the government should promote.  ""With the ICO chaos being cleaned up, the blockchain community will itself attach more importance to identifying solutions to existing problem and technology, and the blockchain industry will see more prudent development,"" he concluded.

42400485,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjh6,1506969040,Ross Ulbricht Drops Claim to Millions Raised in Silk Road Bitcoin Auctions,"Ross Ulbricht  , the convicted operator of the now-defunct dark marketplace Silk Road, has dropped a long-standing claim to millions of dollars previously seized by US law enforcement.  Court records show that on September 29, US District Judge Katherine Forrest issued an order forfeiting just over $48 million to the US government. Those funds were gained as the US Marshals Service auctioned off more than 144,000 bitcoins confiscated during the crackdown on the Silk Road, an unregulated marketplace that used bitcoin as a primary medium of exchange prior to its closure in late 2013. Ulbricht had previously sought to regain possession of the funds after they had been seized.  The US government held its first bitcoin auction in 2014, during which nearly 30,000 BTC was sold to Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper (who would later buy 2,000 BTC in a subsequent auction). The final auction was held in November 2015.  Notably, the forfeited $48 million will count toward the more than $180 million in monetary judgments he was ordered to pay at sentencing. Ulbricht, found guilty in February 2015 on narcotics distribution and computer hacking charges, was sentenced to life in jail without parole in May of that year.  ""The sum of $48,238,116.04 shall be credited in partial satisfaction of the Money Judgment,"" Forrest wrote in the court order.  The forfeiture also comes months after Ulbricht's failed appeal of the judgment. In May, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a 139-page decision that rejected the claim by Ulbricht that he had been given an unfair trial as well as an overly harsh sentence.

The Journal further adds that the trading operation could see input from more than one office within Goldman.

That suggests the firm believes bitcoin’s future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold,"" the Journal reported.

But a spokeswoman told the Journal that, in light of interest from the bank's clientele, ""we are exploring how best to serve them in [the cryptocurrency] space.""

South Korea is currently the world’s second largest Ethereum exchange market, and is evolving into a Ethereum powerhouse, thanks to a rapidly growing number of active developments, domestic projects and communities. So, in terms of trading volumes, liquidity and activity, it really is taking over! South Korean government ban ICO’s This news has come after the South Korean governments and its financial regulator, The Financial Services Commission (FSC) revealed the plans to ban domestic ICO’s, or Initial Coin Offerings. It saw the price of Ether decline by over eight percent, as the ICO industry is a massive market for Ethereum, which led to many traders selling their Ether in panic. This was very short lived though, and the price quickly recovered within hours of this news being released. Despite an overall fall in the Ethereum exchange market from 33 percent to 23 percent, South Korea still managed to secure its position as the second largest market for Ethereum, showing that even with this latest turnaround, Ethereum was still a very strong currency in this country. South Korean Investors One of the reasons that Ethereum market is taking over South Korea is because it is supported by mostly speculative investors. Although speculative investors can, and tend to be influenced by industry movements that can then affect the price of Ethereum. Particularly those that can lead to a decline in price. That said, regardless of this, a large portion of investors are real supporters of Ethereum, and an infrastructure for decentralised applications. Although ICO’s are a considerable market for Ethereum, it is likely that the performance of decentralised applications will evolve as a major factor for the market cap of Ethereum, over the next few years. It has been emphasised that it could take a few years for Ethereum to be at a point in which the decentralised applications with millions of users can be launched and sustained. That said, it should be noted that there are many different multi-billion dollar conglomerates and financial institutions in the Ethereum industry, who are working to develop decentralised applications and platforms on top of the protocol. This is all to create a better environment for decentralised applications, which will allow the highly anticipated projects to evolve. It is easy to see why, when you consider the investors that South Korea have in Ethereum, why it is taking over, and they are becoming a successful Ethereum powerhouse! Buterin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, noted that this kind of mindset and support could lead the country to become a major factor on the impact that the blockchain could have. In an interview, he stated that Ethereum’s main benefits are; “in its generality and in its utility to many kinds of industries” and that this is a result of “Ethereum deliberately being designed as a general-purpose programming platform.” This indicates that the currency could easily continue to take over South Korea, as the applications continue to be tested and implemented.

This should not come as a complete shock, as according to research carried out by Visa, cards are the main form of payment, with the public using them three times more often than the average European. Swedish buses for example, have not taken cash for a number of years, and you cannot use cash to pay for metro tickets. Even more so, by law, retailers have the right to refuse coins and bank notes. So, what does this mean for crypto? Well, for the most, this is seen as very good sign for digital currencies, namely Bitcoin; however, it does bring an element of privacy concerns, due to the fact that every transaction is monitored and surveyed. Many feel that it could see a huge increase in Bitcoin investments, as fewer and fewer establishments accept cash that more people will turn to other forms of virtual currency. According to the Central Bank, Riksbank, cash transactions made up just 2% of all payments made in Sweden for the entire year, and they predict that this figure will simply keep dropping, until eventually, they will become a completely cashless society, which is estimated to happen within five years. Over half of Swedish bank branches no longer keep cash, or will even accept cash deposits, and many areas no longer have ATM’s. The circulation of Swedish Krona has fallen from 106 billion to just 80 billion in seven years. One of the main benefits for turning to Bitcoin as a solution is that it does not requires its users to have a bank account, like other forms of cashless payments do. Users can spend their money anonymously, increasing security and privacy, which is again, an improvement over other forms of cashless payments. Are there any profits to going cashless? The use of cash lacks harvestable personal data, and has to be physically managed. Not only does this take more time, it also means that companies make no profit from the use of cash at all. This is one of the main reasons for Sweden leading the way in cashless transactions. Due to the aforementioned decline in cash, particularly from banks in the country, the Central Bank was left wondering whether it would be more beneficial to introduce a digital form of government backed money, and Bitcoin is the leading choice for a solution. Completely cashless society? We have already mentioned that Sweden is partly there when it comes to operating a cashless society. Cards are the main form of payment, along with Swish, which is a mobile app that uses phone numbers to allow anyone with a smartphone to transfer money from one bank account to another. Despite this raising a number of security and privacy concerns, it has proven to be a very popular way of paying for items. Although Sweden is fast becoming the first country to become completely cashless, other Scandinavian countries are quickly following suit. The Chamber of Commerce of Denmark has already proposed that the majority of retailers should ensure that all financial transactions are carried out electronically in order to eventually ban cash. The Danish Government have even set themselves a deadline of 2030 to completely eliminate paper money. What comes next? We have already seen that other Scandinavian countries are following suit, but what is next for others? Is the UK likely to follow? Like many other countries the UK has seen card, and contactless transactions are increasing, seeing a raise of 200 percent in just one year alone; however, cash is still heavily relied upon, and it would be harder to introduce a completely digital currency, as on average, 2.2 million people still rely exclusively on cash for everyday transactions. It has also just released new polymer bank notes, perhaps suggesting that cash is very much here to stay, for the UK at least.

This should not come as a complete shock, as according to research carried out by Visa, cards are the main form of payment, with the public using them three times more often than the average European. Swedish buses for example, have not taken cash for a number of years, and you cannot use cash to pay for metro tickets. Even more so, by law, retailers have the right to refuse coins and bank notes.

42400497,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjus,1506962134,Bearish Undertone: OMG Token Flirts With Fibonacci Support,"The ICO token with the largest market capitalization continues to hold its own.  At press time Monday, OmiseGo, a token issued in July by online payments startup Omise, was demonstrating traction amongst traders even amidst a bearish news cycle. In recent weeks, South Korea and China have moved to ban ICOs, and though secondary market trading is unaffected, the sector has taken a psychological and reputational hit.  The OMG/USD exchange rate pushed prices to a low of $8.95 on Friday, but the minor blip was quickly undone. That said, it's unclear how much higher prices may go.  The token repeatedly failed to gain altitude above $10 levels over the weekend, though it did defend the 38.2% Fibonacci support of $9.06. At press time, the token is trading at $9.40; down 3 percent as per CoinMarketCap. The ICO token has shed 5.2 percent week-on-week and 12.80 percent month-on-month.  Still, heading into the afternoon sessions, OMG looks heavy as the technical chart carries a bearish undertone.  The price action analysis suggests the OMG/USD exchange rate could witness a knee-jerk sell-off if the support at $9.06 is breached.  4-hours chart  The chart above shows:  Rejection at $11 and lower highs formation over the weekend  Bearish crossover between the 50-MA and 200-DMA. The bearish crossover occurs when the short-term moving average cuts the long-term moving average from above.  Thus, a break below $9.06 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement) would add credence to the bearish price action and shall open doors for a sell-off to $7.40 (50% Fibonacci retracement) and $6.588 (September 15 low).  On the higher side, a move above $10.38 would open up upside towards $11.80 levels.

Making his comments at an international science and technology forum in Kyoto, Japan, Dvorkovich stated:  ""I don't have the slightest doubt blockchain technologies will find broad use in state administration in the short term.""  As reported by Russia's state-owned news service TASS, the politician also spelled out that the technology will require a legal framework in which to operate, adding that authorities are looking to recent regulatory developments in Japan as an example.  ""All of these novelties require legislative foundation for further development, and we’re studying Japan’s experience with much interest now,"" he said.  Japan has taken a more progressive approach toward blockchain and cryptocurrencies compared to other nations. The country passed legislation earlier this year which recognized bitcoin as a form of legal tender, and last week, 11 cryptocurrency exchanges were granted operating licenses.  Dvorkovich continued later emphasized that the actual process of integrating blockchain, as well as other new technologies, could involve some additional hurdles.  ""The greatest challenge for the governments is to develop the regulations that would avert the emergence of a yet another fiscal bubble and would pave the road for new technological and scientific discoveries,"" he said.  Development of these regulations are likely to be completed by 2019, TASS has previously indicated.  The deputy prime minister's statements come as part of a wider effort within Russia to implement blockchain into a variety of services. In a speech in March, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ordered two government ministries and a state-owned development bank to research potential applications of the tech. A week prior, he stated that blockchain could ""decisively change our lives.""  A cryptocurrency law is currently being developed in Russia, though it is likely take a more restrictive tone than Japan's recent legislation. Alexey Moiseev, Russia's deputy finance minister, has said he expects the legislation to impose new restrictions on the kinds of permissible transactions.

42400480,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjdA,1506956360,AngelList Creator Naval Ravikant Backs S&P-Style Cryptocurrency Fund,"A startup led by former Facebook and Google employees is launching a cryptocurrency index fund.  Backed by AngelList founder Naval Ravikant, Bitwise Asset Management is today coming out of stealth mode to reveal its first product, the Bitwise Hold10 Private Index Fund – a market cap-weighted basket of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by network value. With the launch, investors who participate in the fund will own shares meant to reflect the value of the underlying assets, allowing them to achieve what BitWise argues is a broad exposure to the cryptocurrency market.  The fund's co-founders are Hunter Horsley, a former Facebook and Instagram product manager and Wharton graduate, and Hong Kim, a Google veteran and former Korean military software security expert.  One of the key goals of the fund, Horsley said is to create a way for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency with the ease and economy of investing in an S&P 500 index fund.  Horsley told CoinDesk:  ""We want to create a meaningful and secure way to own a portfolio of cryptocurrency. We feel that, today, it's too hard and it's too expensive.""  Bitwise's basic thesis breaks down rather neatly along those lines – particularly the assessment of the founders that existing investing options now present significant challenges to retail investors.  According to Horsley, prior to March of 2017, investors could gain broad exposure to the cryptocurrency asset class simply by owning bitcoin, which until then represented 85 percent of the total market value.  However, with the rise in the total market capitalization of the various different networks to more than $100 billion, he contends that achieving such exposure now requires more active management and, given the nascent stage of the market, specialized expertise.  Fees and features  But amidst a boom in the number of investment options available, Horsely intends to compete on more than simply market knowledge.  Notably, the fund charges just 2 percent on an annualized basis. Further, it does not charge a fee on profits, making it more reasonably priced than alternatives, he claims.  By comparison, other funds are charging investors a traditional hedge fund-style ""two and twenty"" fee, which includes a sizable 20 percent fee charged against any profits the fund generates. While the fund requires investors be both accredited and based in the U.S., the minimum investment is a relatively modest $10,000.  Also, in what he argued puts the fund in contrast to a wave of other hedge funds launched over the summer, Horsley said Bitwise will seek a passive investment strategy. While other funds actively trade crypto assets in an attempt to generate a larger return, he said BitWise will simply hold a portfolio of assets that represents the broader market.  Another advantage, Horsley said, is that retail investors won't have to take ownership of any cryptocurrencies themselves, or to devise a strategy to ensure the security of their investments. ""We are 100 percent 'cold storage',"" he said, in reference to the way the fund stores its assets in a more secure, offline environment.  The only time the assets will come out of cold storage, he added, is when the fund rebalances itself – meaning the times when the fund must buy or sell coins in order to reflect the same relative market capitalizations of the market more broadly.  Horsley explained:  ""I think for some people it can be feasible to store things in hardware wallets, and do it themselves, but there are, of course, a lot of risks to doing that. I think, from a security perspective, having a titled share – the assets of which are then backed by our storage – is really helpful.""

Bitcoin Prices Climb Toward $4,500 on Weak Volumes","Having defended its 50-day moving average last week, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is looking up.  Now eyeing the next psychological resistance level at $4,500, BTC/USD remains well bid even despite the ripple effects of the recent regulatory news from China that caused the fall below $3,000.  At press time, it appears the country's bitcoin exchanges are following through with earlier promises to shut down domestic trading operations, though the lack of major price movement indicates the bearish news has now been priced in.  Prices remained on the front foot over the weekend, as investors shrugged off South Korea's decision to follow China in banning ICOs. Moreover, ether has regained poise, which has helped stabilize sentiment in the cryptocurrency space.  At press time, the BTC/USD pair is trading at $4,420 – up 2.8 percent on the day. The cryptocurrency is up 11.3 percent week-on-week, but still down 4.9 percent on a monthly basis.  The price action analysis suggests that the odds of the cryptocurrency revisiting record highs have improved following the bullish price action over the weekend.  However, patience will be tested as trend indicators signal a lack of vigor in the market. Another slight cause of concern is that volumes remain weak as well.  Daily chart (RSI/DMI)  The rebound from the 100-day moving average followed by a convincing break above the 50-day moving average (as seen in July) coupled with a bullish relative strength index (RSI) and the directional movement index (DMI) indicate scope for a rally to $4,692 (September 6 high) and possibly $5,000 (record high).  DMI is used to confirm price action, and a bullish crossover occurs when the green line crosses up through the red line.  Only a convincing break below $4,180 (confluence of the 50-day moving average and the rising trend line) would abort short-term bullish bias on bitcoin.  Trend lacks strength  Daily chart (volume)  Despite the bullish break above the 50-day moving average, volumes have remained low.  The average directional index (ADX) line is sloping downwards, suggesting the bullish move lacks strength.  View  Although the medium-term outlook is constructive, a minor pullback to $4,200 cannot be ruled out, courtesy of weak volumes and lack of strength as indicated by the ADX line.

42400491,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjoy,1506949216,SAFT Arrives: 'Simple' Investor Agreement Aims to Remove ICO Complexities,"""Toxic."" That's how veteran lawyer Marco Santori described the first ""SAFT"" he saw.  Created by an unidentified token seller as a way to solicit investment, Santori – the head of Cooley LLP's fintech practice – went on to call the document a cheap knockoff of the ""Simple Agreement for Future Equity"" (SAFE) framework popularized by early stage investor Y Combinator.  In true startup fashion, the Cooley partner recalled that it was as if the author simply ""held down control and hit 'F'"" as part of a misguided effort to replace the word ""equity"" with ""tokens.""  But whether true or exaggerated, the story is successful in establishing two points – first, that so-called ""Simple Agreements for Future Tokens"" (SAFTs) are already in sporadic use, and second, that developers and entrepreneurs are badly in need of formal frameworks in their drive to sell tokens for fundraising.  It's against this backdrop that Santori and Protocol Labs executives Juan Benet and Jesse Clayburgh are today introducing a formal white paper for the SAFT concept – an effort they hope will elevate the idea and help it realize its potential.  Far from a way to tame the creativity unleashed by a wave of initial coin offerings (ICOs), Santori framed the release as both a formalization of practices used during Protocol Labs' recent $205 million token sale and a good faith effort to introduce a viable model designed with U.S. law in mind.  Santori told CoinDesk:  ""The paper takes a time slice of what's happening in the market today and it applies the prescriptive rules of at least the U.S. securities, money services and tax laws. Frankly, that's one of the more powerful things about the framework – it doesn't require too much deviation from what's actually happening.""  And here, he notably argues that what's happening in the ICO space isn't the quick cash-grab that's been advertised.  While the blockchain token fundraising model has garnered a ""millions in minutes"" mystique in media coverage, Santori contends the description fails to portray the difficulty inherent in launches that must navigate international law to tap a global liquidity base.  ""We have only analyzed three bodies of federal law,"" he said. ""There are also state laws, and there's also the laws of every damn country in the world to analyze.""  Far from a polished market standard, Santori said he sees the SAFT paper as the start of a conversation between legal experts, developers and investors on how to best advance the concept in order that it can become broadly useful.  Unpacking SAFT  First and foremost to understanding SAFTs is exploring how they differ from tokens, and on this matter, the paper is clear: SAFTs are investment contracts.  As outlined in the paper, SAFTs are designed to be sold to accredited investors as a means of funding development in a way not dissimilar from the way equity changes hands in traditional venture capital. In a SAFT sale, no coins are ever offered, sold or exchanged. Rather, money is exchanged for traditional paper documents that promise access to future product.  ""The developers use the funds to develop a genuinely functional network, with genuinely functional utility tokens, and then deliver those tokens to the investors once functional,"" the paper reads.  By ensuring that no token sales take place prior to the funding, the authors of the SAFT paper argue a key hurdle is overcome: namely, that any resulting tokens created are less likely to meet the definition of a security as put forth under the Howey Test, the standard created by the U.S. Supreme Court to judge whether offerings are securities.  ""If executed as set forth in this white paper, a token sale can permit users to participate financially in that creation and growth without taking on significant enterprise risk,"" the paper reads.  Still, the paper notes that it's possible that the tokens created as a result of a SAFT still could be securities, meaning developers simply can't use the model as a way to avoid legal counsel.  ""Howey is not a black-and-white metric for security status. It is a highly variable facts-and-circumstances test,"" the paper explains.  Investors pledge interest  The formalization of the document was a significant effort for more than the lawyers involved.  Also consulted over the course of its creation were investors who hope to use the tool to explore opportunities in the token market, as well as those seeking to build platforms to connect token issuers and buyers.  For example, Paul Veradittakit, a venture investor at Pantera Capital, said his firm has created its own version of a SAFT, and that it contributed findings to the white paper.  Describing the potential of the development, Veradittakit told CoinDesk:  ""The SAFT is the first tremendous step to bringing a financing structure and standard for token financing that fits with the stage and intent of the companies.""  Still, the investor cautioned that SAFTs will be limited in their utility. For one, there's the fact that the model is primarily aimed at projects wanting to raise money for tokens not intended to be securities.  Erik Syvertsen, general counsel at startup resource giant AngelList, was quick to note that SAFT in no way limits the kinds of tokens that could be eventually listed on CoinList – a new entity that the company is creating in partnership with Protocol Labs for hosting compliant ICOs.  ""We're open to working with all kinds of different projects, and that's not dependant on using a SAFT,"" he told CoinDesk. ""If everyone can get comfortable with a token that has an existing network, and the developer work is complete, we would certainly be interested in that as well.""  Broad strokes  Santori sees SAFT as a framework that offers something for all parties that are involved with, or impacted by, the spread of token sales.  This also includes policymakers who have been eyeing the market with uncertainty. In recent months, the number of global regulators who have clarified rules (or have proclaimed an interest in doing so) has been noticeably on the rise. But not all regulators are waiting for possible signs that market conditions will improve.  Following China's lead, South Korea, one of the more active regions for cryptocurrency trading closed its doors to ICOs last week. Still, Santori hopes to change more minds before such final decisions are made more widely.  ""A good chunk of the white paper is spent on talking about why this harmonizes with policy goals and the principles that drive them,"" he said.  Indeed, the SAFT paper warns against a ""mass exodus"" of U.S. talent and jobs to jurisdictions deemed more friendly to the funding model.  ""In many cases, though, projects based originally and organically in the U.S. have made the difficult decision to relocate the project to non-U.S. jurisdictions like Switzerland. This seems to be due primarily to questions around the applicability of the U.S. securities, money services or tax laws,"" the document reads.  The path ahead  As for what happens now, it seems that's up to the community. After all, as noted by those involved, a framework is only as useful as its adoption.  And issues remain that might inhibit its use. Most notably, there's the fact that SAFTs don't follow through on the promise inherent in the ICO model, that it would ""democratize"" venture capital by opening up deals to retail investors across the globe.  Indeed, Santori went so far as to call this the ""most powerful"" criticism he has yet come across. However, he frames this notion as idealistic and out of touch with how the market is actually developing.  While more than $2 billion has now been raised through the token funding model, the paper argues that 60–80 percent of those funds have been from accredited investors.  Still, Santori stressed that the SAFT model is simply a way to work within existing laws, one that doesn't assume legislative change to accommodate the technology could be possible. For its part, the white paper seeks to stress the benefits of the model, suggesting SAFTs can reduce risks for VCs, while democratizing access through a vibrant secondary market.  ""The SAFT network may prevent someone from buying the next bitcoin at $0.30, but they're still going to get in at $1 or $2,"" Santori argued.  Likewise, Syvertsen suggested that simply exposing such issues to a wider audience was perhaps one of the chief gains to be had from the white paper release, concluding:  ""The path we'd like to see the industry move towards is to one of transparency, and that's the greatest value of the SAFT project, smart lawyers will have a way to improve it and the document can evolve.""

42400493,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjpx,1506945929,Why ICOs Should Want to Be Securities,"Lindsay Lin is a counsel and program manager at Lightyear.io, a company that leverages the open-source Stellar protocol to build digital payments infrastructure and services.  In this opinion piece, Lin argues that issuers of ICOs should not only accept but embrace regulators' classification of their tokens as securities.      In the past year, most organizations conducting initial coin offerings (ICO) have desperately sought to avoid having their tokens categorized as securities.  These organizations tend to emphasize that their tokens are ""utility tokens,"" more akin to a tradable gift card or software license than a security. Others frame their ICOs as donation initiatives, whereby those who contribute bitcoin or ether in exchange for tokens are deemed to have charitably contributed to a foundation or non-profit entity.  However, the SEC's philosophy is ""substance over form."" It is still unclear what token characteristics will suffice to avoid categorization as a security, and the analysis may differ by state.  Contrary to popular sentiment, there are multiple reasons why organizations planning ICOs may actually want to consider issuing security tokens rather than try to avoid the label. When sold in a compliant manner, security tokens have the potential to provide legal certainty (ergo lower risk), strengthen buyer protection and deliver better returns.  Given the uncertain regulatory landscape, there are even benefits to presuming that a token would be categorized as a security.  Issuing security tokens under regulatory frameworks such as Regulation D, Regulation S, Regulation A+, and Regulation Crowdfunding is significantly cheaper and faster than conducting an initial public offering, and it can significantly reduce legal risk.  As the SEC ramps up investigations and enforcement actions, organizations that issue tokens in a compliant manner will have certainty that they will not suffer significant business interruptions from SEC enforcement actions and private litigation arising from unregistered securities offerings.  Gambling on 'utility'  If an organizer freely issues tokens that are later deemed to be securities, this could open up a Pandora's box of potential liability.  Issuing unregistered securities is a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, and, beyond significant monetary penalties, issuers could face a maximum of five years of federal prison. Secondary trading markets that facilitate transactions in the tokens could themselves be liable for penalties for failing to register as a broker-dealer, exchange or alternative trading system (ATS).  Arguably, given that the SEC has limited resources to initiate enforcement actions, private plaintiffs may be the most pervasive nightmare for those who issue unregistered, non-exempt security tokens.  For example, token buyers could instigate private litigation under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act, in which they could obtain monetary damages or rescission of the sale. If the price of the token nosedives below the original ICO price, token buyers may find this option quite attractive. Moreover, token buyers who feel misled or defrauded could leverage the private cause of action in Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Act.  An organization that claims that its tokens are non-security utility tokens, and does not register or use a registration exemption, also must evaluate the “Blue Sky” securities laws of all states in which token buyers reside.  By contrast, if you rely on an SEC exemption like Rule 506(c), 506(b), and Regulation Crowdfunding, federal preemption obviates concerns with any particular state’s ""Blue Sky"" securities laws.  Clarity and recourse  The ultimate goal of the SEC is to protect ordinary investors and prevent them from being taken advantage of by fraudulent entities.  Many compliance requirements, such as disclosures and filings, help to clarify token buyers’ expectations and rights. Limiting certain sales to accredited investors and setting investment limits for non-accredited investors help to protect those who cannot afford to lose money on high risk investments.  Rules against unfair or fraudulent behaviors, such as Rule 10b-5, provide a private right of action for fraudulent activities, affirmative misrepresentation and material omissions, market manipulation, insider trading, and more.  Securities laws have been developed and continuously refined for decades. Security tokens would inherit a wealth of legal precedents that would illuminate token buyer rights, protections and expectations.  Additionally, they would clarify duties and obligations of the issuer.  Flexibility in token structure  What percentage of token buyers purchase ICO tokens for the utility, instead of solely as an investment?  The truth may be that most token buyers are HODLing tokens as an investment, not because they intend to use them personally. While there are utility tokens that are structured to have no investment characteristics, they are few and far between.  If an organization acknowledges that its token is a security, then it can acknowledge it as an investment. The organization could provide token buyers with benefits like dividends, profit shares and voting rights which it would normally avoid if it wanted to avoid the security label. Its security token could still feature significant “utility” attributes; it could still be used in native transactions in an organization’s service or product.  Moreover, the organization can be more transparent with buyers about token economics and how they intend to increase token value.  Bottom Line  If you were to dedicate years of your life to building a revolutionary product and business, wouldn’t you want certainty that your ICO is not a ticking litigation time bomb?  If you are a token investor seeking high monetary returns from your tokens, wouldn’t you want to have defined protections against market manipulation and organizational wrongdoings?  The cryptocurrency community must reevaluate its attitude towards security tokens. Instead of something to fear and avoid, security token ICOs may actually be the path forward.

42400488,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJjl2,1506942010,Two Fewer Tims: R3 Sees Key Employees Depart for New Ventures,"Blockchain consortium R3 has lost two of its most public employees.  Fresh off raising $100 million in May, CoinDesk has confirmed that both Tim Grant, R3's head of global business development, and Tim Swanson, its director of market research, have left to start their own businesses.  But while details about their possible replacements weren't forthcoming, R3 managing director Charley Cooper said he sees the moves as a sign of a maturity in R3's Corda platform, which he expects Grant and Swanson will continue to evangelize in their new ventures.  Cooper told CoinDesk:  ""These guys know so much more about our platform than a company that comes to us as an issue of first impression. They're in a really unique place to go out and push the benefits of Corda because they were there to help develop it.""  Both Swanson and Grant confirmed their intent to maintain ties with the group.  Launched in 2014 with a mission to streamline transactions at financial institutions by using shared, permissioned ledgers, the consortium now boasts more than 100 members. Still, even with those achievements, the executive exits demonstrate how hard it is for blockchain companies to hold onto talent.  R3 now employs 140 people, including about 15 contractors.  Swanson's song  Swanson, who left R3 earlier this month, plans to stay on as an advisor, but is focusing his attention on Post Oak Labs, a consultancy he founded to help fintech firms navigate regulatory requirements and other challenges.  In his first interview since launching Post Oak, Swanson said, ""I felt there was a big gap in the market in the fintech world and blockchain-related stuff, and I felt that I could leverage the knowledge I had to fix that.""  Before R3, Swanson spent almost four years as an independent market research consultant. During that time he published two books (one on smart property and one on bitcoin), and advised firms including Koinify, a now-closed bitcoin crowdfunding platform.  With that experience under his belt, Swanson said his part consultancy, part intellectual property firm will also help entrepreneurs turn dormant or ill-used ideas into companies and sort through opportunities for investment and partnerships.  Rather than raise capital, Swanson said he'll fund his new business with revenue from existing relationships. Of the 500 or so companies he said he's spoken with during his time at R3, Swanson said he's now in talks with 45 family offices, startups and other organizations looking for a sense of clarity around blockchain.  ""They hear the permanent bullish perspective on blockchain, but they don't hear from anyone who has a more nuanced view. They're wanting a different perspective than the pumpers you see on social media,"" Swanson told CoinDesk.  Grant's spin-off  On the other hand, Grant's new startup, DrumG, has all the markings of an R3 spin-off, with a business model that appears geared toward providing consulting services to companies building with the enterprise version of R3's Corda.  Grant, who previously worked as managing director of risk management at the hedge fund manager UBS O'Connor, joined R3 in December 2015 as CEO of its Lab and Research Center, where he helped oversee projects with the consortium's members.  While an early version of the DrumG website described the company as having a ""DLT vision with execution,"" the now-modified site has dropped that language. LinkedIn describes the project as focused on building distributed ledger applications using Corda Enterprise.  Added in the recent update of the website is speed-test service that appears to let users test transaction volumes. The test is processed by 14 nodes around the world using both the RAFT consensus and Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithms. Further, a password-protected guest area appears to be focused on trade finance applications.  Currently, little else is known about the company, other than a comment provided by R3's Cooper: ""The conversations around DrumG have been going on longer than with Tim Swanson's group. We're still finalizing conversation with Post Oak.""  That statement seems to suggest both Tims will continue to work closely with their former employer going forward.

On its website, BTCC now states that all local trading in yuan and cryptocurrencies has been officially suspended as of midday, September 30, Beijing time. The exchange stopped accepting deposits on September 27, with China-based users being advised to withdraw their funds from the exchange before the end of October.  In a tweet accompanying the closure, BTCC claims to have had the longest known lifespan for a cryptocurrency exchange, having operated for a ""world record"" of 2,305 days.  The closure of the exchange's China-facing trading operations comes following a statement from financial regulators on September 4, which banned developers and entrepreneurs from launching token sales (or ICOs) within the country. Exchanges in the country have since ""voluntarily"" decided to cease trading activities, though regulatory pressure is widely believed to have been the catalyst.  BTCC will continue to operate trading services outside China, and has also confirmed that its mining pool will continue to operate normally. Other major cryptocurrency exchanges in the country – including Yunbi, Huobi and OKCoin – are expected to cease trading by the end of October.

Arrested in July by authorities on behalf of the U.S. government, Vinnik was charged with money laundering, computer hacking, fraud and drug trafficking alongside his former employer, bitcoin exchange BTC-e. However, the trial is perhaps best seen as the first step in a larger tug-of-war that will find the Greek justice minister deciding where a judge will hear the case.  At issue will likely be the now-murky details of Vinnik's role at the company. For example, while BTC-e originally claimed it had no association with Vinnik, in his first interview after being arrested, he admitted he worked for the exchange. The U.S. government has also taken a different stance on his involvement, framing him as the ""operator"" of BTC-e.  Further complicating matters, is that Vinnik, a Russian national, is also wanted for fraud charges in his home country. According to Russia Today, he has agreed to be extradited to Russia, though no hearing date on that matter has yet been set.  Both countries claim Vinnik laundered some $4 billion through BTC-e over the course of six years. One of the oldest bitcoin exchanges, BTC-e was shut down after being raided by U.S. authorities in July.  Despite its troubles, the exchange is attempting a revival.

In a report released last week, the Republic of Korea's National Police Agency (NPA) said the incidents – which were said to be ultimately unsuccessful – did occur. It further detailed that 25 employees at four different exchanges were targeted in 10 separate ""spear phishing"" attempts since July.  Spear phishing is when a would-be hacker pretends to be someone else in order to trick the victim into providing login or other details.  The confirmation comes several weeks after cybersecurity firm FireEye published a report on the attacks.  AFP, citing regional news source Yonhap, reported that those behind the attacks pretended to be security specialists and sent emails with malware included as attachments. The police report further indicated that the hacking attempts also targeted smartphones, suggesting that they may have been attempting to compromise devices used for two-factor authentication.  Perhaps most notably, the NPA indicated that none of the investigated attempts resulted in either the loss of funds or an actual security breach, according to AFP. No exchanges were identified in the report.

42379927,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LIgn,1506931224,Case-By-Case or Cease-and-Desist? In Search Of a New Approach to ICOs,"That rumble you hear is the sound of regulators around the world mobilizing resources to tackle the pressing matter of token sales.  Yet, in spite of the spectacular growth of blockchain token-based funding, no one seems to have a clear idea of what type of rules to introduce. The resulting uncertainty (not to mention ridicule) is left hindering progress as money flows to unviable projects and investors are left vulnerable to foul play – exactly what regulation is supposed to prevent.  Perhaps a new approach is needed.  But to see where this could go, it's worth stepping back and asking what we expect the regulation to do.  Safety belt  First, why do we need regulation, not just of finance, but of anything at all?  To protect us. At its roots, that is the main role of government – to protect its citizens from avoidable harm and extreme loss brought about by others or from our own lack of common sense. When it comes to securities, that usually means stopping us from making poor decisions.  After all, the word ""security"" means ""safety,"" from the latin securus, or ""free from care."" Obviously, with time, the original intent of financial securities got buried in market myth, and the promise of high returns changed the connotation, implying risk.  As markets got more complex, instruments emerged that creatively skirted around the rules, which fostered innovation but also fragility, as we saw in 2008. Many argue that stronger oversight and tighter limitations could have prevented the crash – but at the time, innovation seemed like the better option.  This is especially relevant now that digital token sales have entered the picture.  Second, given the risk inherent in ideas with no working model, barely any documentation and doubtful liquidity, should the state intervene to ""protect"" us from token sales? The concern is that heavy-handed control would quash the fascinating progress going on in the space.  However, a wait-and-see approach is perhaps not doing enough to prevent extreme loss.  In applying a blanket rule with few specifics, the SEC seems to be taking a hybrid approach. In addition to its previous admonitory statements, this past week it announced not one but two new task forces to strengthen its footprint in token activity and investor protection.  While this is no doubt designed to both reassure and warn the market, it is still lacking in concrete guidance, requires case-by-case analysis and relies on post-hoc measures.  Checklist  A more solid and less resource-intensive solution could be to focus more on prevention than penalties.  This could be done by making it harder to sell newly issued tokens, regardless of structure, through disclosure and due diligence conditions.  Similar to the filing requirements for an IPO, tighter pre-sale rules could confirm that participants see the relevant documentation, while analysts have greater access to pertinent information and regulated alternative exchanges – such as the one revealed by tØ earlier this week – have time to ensure a minimum level of liquidity.  Establishing disclosure requirements would also streamline the regulators' workflow, and set clear guidelines for new ideas without eliminating either risk or creativity. What's more, it would impose a discipline on issuers, while leaving the ultimate decision on whether or not to participate to better-informed investors.  While passing through hurdles to get authorization does not necessarily mean that an issue is a good value or even honorable, it could serve to filter the flow and mitigate some of the risk.  And, obviously, not everyone thinks that regulation in financial instruments is a good idea – or even that it's possible.  But for buyers that want protection and issuers that want respectability, official support can open up new areas of opportunity and growth.  Changing lanes  The SEC has already shown its willingness to forgo full-IPO levels of disclosure, with its Regulation A+ exemptions. A different category could be introduced for blockchain tokens that harness some of the advantages of this new distribution mechanism while ensuring a certain level of probity.  It would mean higher issuance costs than the current situation, which will push some contenders out of the market. However, projects with solid prospects and decent fundamentals should be able to cover those costs, either through existing revenues or through the intervention of angel and venture capital investors.  This type of collaboration could perhaps put a welcome end to the talk of ICOs ""replacing"" traditional financing methods, and encourage more stable, hybrid approaches.  It would also help bypass the prickly need to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a token is a security or a ""utility coin."" It wouldn't matter – ideally, they would all be a bit of both.  As well as simplifying the regulation of the sector – giving it a solid base from which to innovate while offering a certain level of comfort and upside to buyers – this approach would help shift us from the set mindset that new concepts can be defined by old categories. That alone could be enough to unleash another wave of creativity, giving rise to new functions, ecosystem and terminologies.  Who knows, perhaps we could come up with a better word to describe this new paradigm-changing concept, more in line with its potential. And ""security"" could go back to meaning something secure.  And ""security"" could go back to meaning something secure.
