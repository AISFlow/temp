42380317,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MpdH,1517523336,Bee Token ICO Stung by $1 Million Phishing Scam,"Investors in the decentralized home sharing network Bee Token’s initial coin offering (ICO) have been swindled of nearly $1 million in just over 25 hours.  Bee Token, which recently partnered with San Francisco-based financial services platform WeTrust to create a decentralized competitor to home-sharing service AirBnB, launched its public ICO on Jan. 31.  However, while the startup runs its token sale, scammers posing as operators appeared to have launched their own version. Using email addresses like presale_regirstration@thebeetoken.com, the scammers contacted would-be buyers who then signed up for the full token sale.  All told, signs indicated that those involved collected at least $928,000 from potential investors.  It is not immediately clear how the scammers acquired investors' emails, though one Reddit user claims the startup failed to secure their email database. The scheme involved emailing victims an ethereum address or a QR code which lead to the address, telling them to invest quickly to significantly increase their returns, according to one user who shared the email they received.  Three ethereum addresses, two of which are confirmed to be part of the Bee Token scam and one of which has only been confirmed to be related to phishing schemes in general, show balances ranging from $100,000 to nearly $600,000. The earliest transaction for any of the three addresses happened on Jan. 31, at roughly the same time the token sale began.  In a statement released late last week, the company confirmed the existence of the scams, saying investors should only send funds to an address listed on the startup’s official website.  Notably, the company went on to state that even email addresses ending in @thebeetoken.com would be impersonators:  “Further, we will NEVER communicate ANY funding address via any channel other than on beetoken.com. If you are solicited to send money to an address (even if it’s from a thebeetoken.com email address, official Bee Token social media accounts, or Bee Token telegram moderator/group), please report this to a moderator on Telegram (@DTodd) and email team@thebeetoken.com.”  In another statement, the company stated it would not use QR codes, give 100% bonuses, accept more than 0.3 ETH or partner with Microsoft.  The startup completed a successful private pre-sale in late December, as well as a public pre-sale earlier this year. So far the company has raised roughly $10 million.

42380299,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MpLf,1517518813,UPS Might Be Making a Locker That Accepts Bitcoin,"Global shipping giant UPS may be looking at accepting bitcoin through an item-exchange locker service, newly published patent filings show.  UPS is eyeing a system of locker banks that can take digital forms of payment, according to an application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Thursday. In addition to traditional payment systems, the patent filing lists bitcoin as a possible currency to pay with.  The filing outlines a system of lockers where a party trading or selling an item can leave it in the locker for a buyer to pick up at their convenience. Some of these lockers may be configured to accept payments if the parties are renting the locker.  The filing outlines different methods by renters can pay for the locker, specifically stating:  “In example embodiments, the locker bank may include a point-of-sale (POS) system for accepting payment from users in the form of: (1) a cash transaction; (2) a credit or debit card transaction; (3) a gift certificate; (4) an electronic payment, such as payment by Google Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, Bitcoin; and/or (5) any other suitable type of payment.”  The patent application mentions bitcoin again later, as a way to refund customers, among more traditional payment methods like credit.  The filing is the latest example of a patent application that lists bitcoin as a possible payment method. While this isn't indicative that companies are moving en-masse to accept the cryptocurrency, its inclusion as an option highlights its profile as a digitized medium of exchange.  In 2017, more than 20 patent filings released by the USPTO mentioned bitcoin as a possible payment system. While the number dropped slightly from 2016, more than 50 patent filings released by the agency in the last two years reflect this line of thinking.

42380316,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mpc1,1517513412,Crypto Cleanup? Law Group to Focus on Tech Messes,"Stephen Palley, a lawyer in Washington D.C., known for his wry tweets about the industry's travails, has started a blockchain and cryptocurrency practice with an unusual focus.  The new 10-person team at Anderson Kill will concentrate on mediating disputes and what people in the traditional finance world call ""workouts"" – that is, resolving distressed situations.  It's a fitting mission for Palley, who has long voiced skepticism about the just-do-it mentality of some tech innovators. In his view, many projects are forging ahead without first thinking through dry but critical matters such as governance, indemnification, directors and officers insurance and so on.  This creates a need for lawyers who can help companies stay out of trouble – or get out of it.  As Palley told CoinDesk:  ""I'm the guy you talk to before you get started, or after you have problems because you didn't talk to someone like me first.""  While many big law firms have created blockchain or digital currency practices in recent years, few have positioned them as cleanup crews. Silver Miller, which has sued a number of cryptocurrency exchanges and ICO promoters, comes closest, though Palley said he's not particularly interested in class-action plaintiff work.  Palley, who has 18 years of litigation experience, joined Anderson Kill in April 2016. His previous work at the firm involved construction and other insurance disputes, but also software development.  Taking advantage of that tech knowledge, he hopes to help clients build things that are useful but compliant. Blockchain networks, which know no borders, present interesting challenges in this regard.  ""If somebody wants to work with a system of nodes that are distributed among various jurisdictions, you have to think through things a lawyer might worry about,"" such as local healthcare privacy laws, copyright, or takedown notices, he said.  But for clients who failed to do that sort of thinking at the outset, he and his colleagues are ready to defend them in court when necessary. Last year, he noted, he won a three-week trial case in a federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y.  Throwing shade  The web page for Anderson Kill's new practice takes a dig at members of the profession who have branded themselves as blockchain advocates: ""We are lawyers, not 'CryptoLawyers.'""  Palley said his main objection to that term is that unlike ""divorce lawyer"" or ""securities lawyer,"" which indicate specialized knowledge but are essentially neutral descriptions, adding the ""crypto-"" prefix positions attorneys as ""fellow travelers.""  Such positioning ""could preclude them from providing advice people don't want to hear,"" he said, adding:  ""People don't hire me because of my ideological or philosophical bent. They hire me to provide neutral advice that's in their best interest.""

42380309,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MpUT,1517508051,SPECTRE Creators Propose 'PHANTOM' Blockchain Protocol,"The researchers behind the SPECTRE and GHOST projects have proposed a new blockchain scalability protocol.  Called PHANTOM, the protocol claims to provide transaction confirmation that is ""secure under any throughput that the network can support"" – smart contracts included.  Authors Yonatan Sompolinsky and Dr. Aviv Zohar outlined the new protocol in a paper published this week, building on SPECTRE, which deviates from bitcoin's common block structure with more scalable ""directed acyclic graphs of blocks""(blockDAGs). The team describes the tech as ""a generalization of Satoshi's chain which better suits a setup of fast or large block[s].""  Unlike off-chain solutions such as the Lightning Network, where transactions are conducted on a separate layer, Phantom proposes an on-chain means of achieving scalability.  The authors explain that PHANTOM's primary focus is that it enables the linear ordering of blocks, which is not possible in the SPECTRE protocol. To do so, it uses a ""greedy algorithm"" on the blockDAG to identify blocks mined by ""honest"" nodes, but not those from ""non-cooperating"" nodes that deviate from the mining protocol.  The paper states:  ""Using this distinction, PHANTOM provides a full order on the blockDAG in a way that is eventually agreed upon by all honest nodes.""  Solving the problem of linear ordering, the authors say, enables PHANTOM to scale any computation, including smart contracts.  However, Sompolinsky and Zohar note that, by adopting linear ordering, the protocol sacrifices some of the speed of confirmation previously achieved by SPECTRE. The researchers indicated their plans to resolve this problem in future work.

As of press time, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) had hit a low of $8,932.89, a move that came hours after the market opened above $10,000. As previously reported, the price of bitcoin has seen significant volatility on Thursday as it fell below that figure.  The fall below $9,000 marks the lowest bitcoin has fallen since late November 2017, market data shows, when it first reached that milestone. As of press time, the price of bitcoin was trading at roughly $8,954.13, representing a decline of roughly 11%.  Additional market data reflects how many other cryptocurrencies are seeing price declines during the day's session. Most of the top 25 cryptocurrencies are seeing double-digit percentage declines over the past 24 hours, according to price-tracking websites CoinMarketCap and OnChainFX.

According to a transcript published by LiveMint, Jaitley – giving an annual budget speech – reiterated the policy view and said that the government would take measures against the tech's use for illegitimate purposes. He also referred to prohibiting their use ""as part of the payment system,"" though what this means in practice remains to be seen pending expected regulations from the government.  He was quoted as (per the transcript):  ""The Government does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system.""  In early December  , Jaitley said the Indian government was working on recommendations to regulate cryptocurrencies but had acknowledged that there are currently no rules surrounding digital currencies. The government has set up a committee with the central bank and various government departments to study possible regulations.  ""The government's position is clear, we don't recognize this as legal currency as of now,"" he said at the time.  In contrast to his comments on cryptocurrencies, Jaitley mentioned blockchain technology in a more positive light during Thursday's speech, noting its use in recording transactions or data without requiring an intermediate platform.  ""The Government will explore [the] use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in [a] digital economy,"" he said, per the transcript.  The comments have raised fears that India is moving to ban cryptocurrencies outright, though it remains to be seen what specific measures the government will introduce following Jaitley's comments.

The price of XRP fell to a two-week low of $0.99 today, according to CoinDesk's Ripple Price Index. The XRP/USD exchange has depreciated by 11.86 percent in the last two hours, indicates CoinMarketCap.  As of writing, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands at $1.01. XRP was last seen this low on Jan. 17 when prices fell to $0.85.  The recovery that ensued then ran out of steam in the $1.72 neighborhood on Jan. 18. Since then, XRP has been steadily losing altitude, creating lower highs (bearish prices) on the price chart despite big financial firms publicly expressing their interest in the blockchain startup's technology.  That said, XRP is not the only loser today. Except for ethereum's ether token, all top 20 currencies by market capitalization are trading in the red. Bitcoin has dropped by 8.69 percent in the last 24 hours. Cardano and Stellar are down 14 percent, while bitcoin cash has depreciated by 10 percent.  The price chart suggests that XRP could extend the decline to 0.8647 levels.  XRP chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Bears are in control, as indicated by the series of higher lows.  5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA are trending lower, indicating a bearish setup.  The relative strength index (RSI) also favors further losses in XRP.  $0.86 marks the confluence of the 100-day MA and 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from Dec. 7 low to Jan. 4 high.  View  XRP looks set to test $0.8647 in the next 12–24 hours.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $0.8647 would expose support at $0.64 (Dec. 18 low). However, a move below $0.86 may end up pushing the 4-hour RSI and the daily RSI into oversold territory (below 30.00). So, the odds of a further decline to $0.64 would be low.  Bullish scenario: Meanwhile, only a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA would signal bearish invalidation and could yield short-term consolidation.

42380312,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MpWz,1517493617,Illinois Eyes Blockchain for IDs and Public Asset Management,"An Illinois government task force has outlined how it might apply blockchain technologies in the state's inter-government operations.  According to a report filed on Jan. 31 by the Illinois Blockchain Task Force to the General Assembly, the state is eyeing the use of blockchain technologies to manage state resident identification, tokenize assets and reduce entitlement fraud.  The task force detailed in the report that using a blockchain-powered platform would allow residents to access and store all their ID information, such as tax records, voting histories and driver licenses as decentralized nodes. This user-centric model would then let residents own the information and share it with different government agencies for public services.  The report states:  ""This new model would reimagine the relationship between state and individual, as government would become the verifier, rather than the custodian, of people's public service identity. Government would move from providing data storage to verifying identity, allowing users to store access to personal data securely on devices.""  In addition, the team also suggested that blockchain technology has potential for Illinois' public sector in digitalizing assets such as tax credits, social benefits and municipal bonds.  By tokenizing these asset through blockchain technology, such as the ethereum blockchain, transparency can be brought to each transaction, the report said. This improves efficiency by reducing manual paperwork while avoiding benefit entitlement fraud.  Also as part of its research initiative, the task force has published a database that tracks worldwide initiatives currently exploring blockchain and distributed ledger technologies in public sectors.  The long-waited report comes as the latest research effort by the inter-government task force, which was required by the state's legislative house to present potential areas in which blockchain could be utilized.  Formed by law in June last year, the group has seen contributions from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR), the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and the Department of Innovation and Technology, among others.

42380311,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MpZV,1517490314,When Crypto Exchanges Hold More Than Your Money,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and a former editor in chief of American Banker.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Each of these three stories out of Asia is significant on its own, but when you read them side by side they tell a much bigger, global story.  First, on Jan. 23 South Korea's financial regulator set a date for the introduction of a new rule barring anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts. (Or, as some sensitive snowflakes out there prefer we'd put it, ""requiring customer identification for crypto trading accounts"" – we never imagined anyone in this space would want to sugarcoat unwelcome news with euphemisms, yet here we are. But I digress...)  The very next day, a different South Korean agency fined several cryptocurrency exchanges for failing to secure customer data. ""While the security threats such as virtual currency speculation and hacking of handling sites are increasing, the actual situation of personal information protection of major virtual currency exchanges is very weak,"" warned the chairman of the Korea Communications Commission in announcing the fines.  Topping it all off, on Jan. 26, Coincheck, a crypto exchange in Japan, admitted it had been hacked in what appears to be the largest single theft in cryptocurrency history. Some $533 million-worth of a mid-tier crypto known as XEM were pilfered.  So let's step back here. Taken together, these events remind us that:  Concerned about money laundering and financial crime, international regulators want to make sure crypto exchanges, like most financial intermediaries, know who their customers are. Depending on how much crypto a user trades, this entails the exchanges collecting all sorts of personally identifiable information: real name, address, a copy of your passport, even a selfie.  The exchanges aren't very good at securing this data. Which isn't a surprise, because...  They aren't very good at securing users' funds, either.  Experienced crypto users will tell you that the answer to No. 3 is to keep most of your coins in cold storage and use the exchanges only for assets you're actively trading. But the first two observations present a much knottier problem.  In short, the juxtaposition lays bare the fundamental tension between compliance with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer laws, on the one hand, and data privacy on the other.  No easy fix  There are a number of ways to potentially resolve this conflict:  Revisit AML laws.Ha. Fat chance.  Not that these don't deserve greater scrutiny. Libertarian early adopters of bitcoin may overstate their case (and invite ridicule from smug, soy-eating bluechecks) when they declare ""money laundering is not a crime."" A better way to put it is this: It stands to reason that covering up a crime is itself a crime, but should it be a crime to obscure activity that is not itself illegal or harmful, simply because doing so inconveniences law enforcement?  Some would say the answer is yes. There is a lot of nasty activity going on out there, even if you exclude victimless crimes (those involving only consenting adults). But the question needs to be asked of policymakers more than it has been. Still, don't hold your breath for much in the way of change in a political climate shaped by 9/11, Charlie Hebdo, San Bernardino, etc.  Exempt crypto businesses from AML laws. LOL, JK. See above.  Require exchanges to tighten up cybersecurity. Say what you will about Benjamin Lawsky, but the former New York State regulator and architect of the BitLicense recognized the importance of diligent security practices for digital asset custodians. In fact, the strict cybersecurity standards he wrote for cryptocurrency firms in that controversial regulation were later imposed on traditional financial institutions on the NYS Department of Financial Services' watch (over their objections).  Granted, the BitLicense hasn't exactly been a roaring success, with a grand total of four licenses granted since the regulation took effect in 2015 (unless you count the two trust charters given to applicants). Most startups in the crypto space have simply avoided doing business with Empire State residents or performed contortions to get around the regulations, viewed as onerous for a number of reasons. But the cybersecurity requirements aren't usually cited among them.  More to the point, though, this approach still amounts to saying ""thou shalt collect and store nuclear waste – oh, and you better secure it, too."" More creative solutions might be in order.  Thread the needle. In other words, find a way to satisfy the objective of fighting crime without making businesses hold all this data in the first place.  For example, there is an adjacent ecosystem of digital identity startups and open-source projects aiming to create personal data vaults and reusable IDs. Although models vary, a common thread is that instead of giving the keys to your identity to every stranger you do business with, you could just present them with proof that you are entitled to access a given resource.  For example, a bouncer at a club needs to know you're old enough to drink, but not your exact birthday; similarly, if you can prove to a bitcoin exchange that you're not on the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control's sanctions list, maybe they wouldn't need that copy of your passport.  The big idea is that not everyone you trade with needs to know who you are as long as someone knows who you are. Law enforcement could still trace transactions through the blockchain, to an exchange, and ultimately to an identity provider that could identify the user under court order.  Generally this concept, articulated in the 2014 Windhover Principles and elsewhere, sounds like an improvement on the status quo. But real-world applications have been rare.  Also, you could argue that even if put into wider practice, these ID solutions might amount to a mere rearrangement of deck chairs, at best. If we no longer have lots of nuclear waste facilities, but instead have a few big nuclear waste facilities (with back doors for law enforcement to boot), won't that make identity thieves' job even easier?  And finally, even if these ID providers are secure, who's to say they'd insist on seeing a warrant before giving up your data to the government? The Snowden revelations showed how the odious ""third-party doctrine,"" which states that citizens have no reasonable expectation of privacy when they give information to a business, has undermined Fourth Amendment protections in the U.S. It's hard to trust governments to respect constitutional limits on their power in this day and age, and Donald Trump occupying the Oval Office is really the least of it.  One sincerely hopes that the development of decentralized exchange will eventually make the issue moot, at least as it relates to trading of digital assets. Until then, stay vigilant about protecting your money, your personal information, and your civil liberties.

42380314,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mpfn,1517487015,Bitcoin Sinks Below $10k on $133 Billion January Loss,"Bitcoin price has dropped to the lowest level since for two weeks and could drop below $9,000 in the next 24 hours, price charts indicate.  The downward move follows a month for bitcoin when its market capitalization has tumbled from a high of $296 billion on Jan. 5 to $163 billion today – a $133 billion (44.93 percent) loss.  Having failed to hold above the $10,000 mark for the third time in last 48 hours, prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) dropped to $9,480. The BPI was last seen this low on Jan. 17, when prices fell to $9,199.59.  On a 24-hour basis, bitcoin (BTC) is down 6.16 percent, according to data source CoinMarketCap. Further, the price action in the last 48 hours has established the former support zone of $10,000–$10,313 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low–high) as a strong resistance.  15-minute chart  The above chart shows bitcoin repeatedly ran into offers in the range of $10,000–$10,313 over the last two days. The drop from the high of $10,166 seen today has yielded a downside break of the 700-point trading range defined by $9,600 (Jan. 31 low) and $10,300 (Jan. 31 high).  So, the doors are open for a drop to $8,900 (target as per the measured height method; range value subtracted from range floor).  Bitcoin chart (log scale)  BTC has also breached the ascending trendline support (now resistance) of $9,880, adding credence to the bearish set up on the 15-minute chart.  The same trendline support is seen around $5,700 on a linear (arithmetic chart below). However, linear charts tend to be a bit distorted with fast-moving assets like bitcoin.  Meanwhile, the logarithmic chart is plotted in such a way that two equal percent changes are plotted as the same vertical distance on the scale. Therefore, distortions created by one or two big price moves (on linear chart) are smoothed out.  Also, as seen in the above chart, BTC tends to respect trendlines drawn on logarithmic charts.  Still, it is worth noting that as per the linear chart below, the trendline drawn from the Sep. 15 low and Nov. 12 low could offer support around 9,048 today.  Bitcoin chart (linear scale)  BTC looks set to test $8,900 in the next 24 hours.  A corrective rally due to intraday oversold conditions cannot be ruled out, but may be short-lived as the 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA are trending down.  Price action in the last 48 hours has established $10,000–$10,313 as a strong resistance zone. So, only a daily close (as per UTC) above $10,313 would signal bearish invalidation. Meanwhile, a move above $11,690 (Jan. 25 high) would signal a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

42380302,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MpMv,1517482819,Cloud Network Xunlei Hit By Class Actions Over ICO,"Amid its blockchain and cryptocurrency pivot, cloud-based content delivery network Xunlei has been hit by two class action suits alleging it distributed false information that materially affected its stock price.  According to filings with the New York Southern District court on Jan. 18 and Jan. 24, the lawsuits against Xunlei, its CEO Chen Lei, CFO Eric Zhou and Zhou's predecessor Wu Tao, are being brought by investors who purchased Xunlei stock from Oct. 10, 2017 to Jan. 11, 2018.  The filings state that during that period, Xunlei announced its shift into exploring blockchain technology, and subsequently launched a blockchain-based token to facilitate its cloud services.  The plaintiffs allege that the company, while knowingly participating in unlawful initial coin offerings, also issued a series of false statements about the legitimacy of this activity, which led to a material impact on its stock price. As such, the plaintiffs are seeking remedy through legal action.  Xunlei, based in China and listed on the NASDAQ exchange, was one of the first publicly traded companies that saw its stock price rise then plunge amid a business pivot into blockchain technology in late 2017.  Yet, the latest legal cases perhaps also mark the first time investors have teamed up to bring charges over questionable moves by public companies that have moved or pivoted operations into blockchain and cryptocurrency services.  Blockchain pivot  According to the court documents, the cases stem from the initial announcement on Oct. 10, 2017, when Xunlei said it would launch its own blockchain-based cryptocurrency dubbed OneCoin, also known as Wanke Coin, which was later renamed to Lianke, or LinkToken in English.  According to announcements at the time, Wanke Coin was issued as a reward for Xunlei's OneCloud users who were willing to share their idle network bandwidth on its platform. In order to receive this reward, users need to purchase an item of hardware called OneThing Cloud from Xunlei to be able to share their cloud storage and network bandwidth.  The firm doubled down on its commitment to its blockchain pivot in an earnings release in November.  ""Xunlei is transforming itself from a traditional internet service provider of membership subscription to a growth-oriented company developing innovative cloud computing products and exploring emerging blockchain technology,"" Li was quoted as saying in the statement.  Following the announcement, Xunlei's stock price surged from around $4 per share in October to as high as $25 in November, which was followed by major declines that triggered the plaintiffs' allegations.  Initial miner offering?  But what perhaps sparked the controversy to begin with was the timing and nature of the blockchain-based issuance, which arrived just a month after China's central bank put the notable ban on domestic initial coin offerings.  Amid challenges over Xunlei's motivation, Chen has stated publicly that its Wanke token is only for utility purpose and not allowed for trading, thus it was not conducting an initial coin offering, claiming the company had been abiding by Chinese law.  However, the plaintiffs allege that the statement is false and that Wanke Coin has the substance of an ICO while under the disguise of a business pivot, since the company requires users to purchase hardware to start receiving token rewards.  The court document further cited a notable announcement by China's National Internet Finance Association, which specifically pointed out on Jan. 11 that Xunlei's model is bypassing the ICO regulation through a disguise called an ""initial miner offering.""  ""In the case of Lianke issued by Xunlei, for example, the issuing company in effect substitutes Lianke for the duty to pay back project contributors with legal tender, making it essentially a financing activity and a form of disguised ICO. In addition, with frequent promotional activities and publishing of trading tutorials, Xunlei has lured many citizens without sound discernment into IMO activities,"" NIFA noted at the time.  Although the NIFA is a self-regulatory association, not a regulatory agency, it was launched by the People's Bank of China and authorized by the State Council.

42380308,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MpYF,1517475616,Alt-Right ICO? Gab to Sell $10 Million in Tokens,"One of the internet's more controversial social media brands is getting into the crypto-powered fundraising game.  Revealed in an SEC filing on Tuesday, the alt-right-friendly Gab let slip it intends to raise $10 million in a forthcoming initial coin offering (ICO). But perhaps most notable about the company's plan is its decision to take a compliant route to reaching investors.  As opposed to opening up its token offering to just any global buyer, Gab will pursue its funding under Reg A+, a creation of the 2012 Jobs Act that allows non-accredited U.S. investors to buy equity in startups. (Gab first announced its plans to run an ICO in August, but hadn't revealed how much it would raise or how it would do so.)  Following the filing, Gab CEO Andrew Torba clarified that the company has created 2 million ethereum-based ""gab"" tokens that, due to the mechanics of the design, will effectively function as Class B shares in the company.  Selling for $5 apiece when released, Gab tokens will represent 16.6 percent of the total equity in the business, Torba said, adding:  ""There's no tricks or utility made-up nonsense. It's an equity token plain and simple.""  Equity held in gab tokens may be reduced later with the issuance of new shares of common or preferred stock, as the circular acknowledges. (The token shares are non-voting.)  To those who have been following closely, though, Gab's plan of action may not be surprising. For one, the company has been dismissive of many aspects of the ICO trend to date, referring in another Medium post to a controversial project as a ""dumpster fire.""  Utsav Sanduja, Gab's COO and global affairs director, expounded on this theme in an email, writing that he believes many ICOs have been ""fraudulently raising funds"" by bypassing regulations and standards.  ""We believe this is the wrong approach,"" he said. ""We have many crypto millionaires on Gab who love liberty and our mission, but were unable to invest in our last round which was fully in fiat.""  Launched in 2016, the company is known as a gathering place for the alt-right.  A visitor to the site today will find lots of posts about President Donald Trump, memes mocking activist celebrities and a pretty decent animal photos thread (with a smattering of body painting mixed in among the dog memes).  Despite making some noises last year to diversify its audience, the SEC filing describes the ""massively underserved"" niche market it hopes to capitalize on:  ""We estimate that there are over 50 million conservative, libertarian, nationalist and populist internet users from around the world who are seeking an alternative to the current social networking ecosystems.""  Investors have already registered an intention to buy $1.6 million-worth of tokens, and there is no date scheduled for the offering because it's contingent on regulatory approval, though the team hopes to run the sale in the first or second quarter of the year.  Social media exodus  Stepping back, details were also revealed about the platform on which the tokens will operate and how it could add value to Gab's existing offering.  The company, for example, has a vision to create a new architecture for social media that it's calling the ""Exodus Protocol."" It doesn't have a white paper or a complete technical description other than a broad outline described on Gab's page on Start Engine, from which it will sell the equity tokens.  The page describes Exodus as a peer-to-peer social networking infrastructure that will allow Gab to ""offload the risks of routing data."" The current plan is to build it in a decentralized fashion, leaning on existing protocols like the distributed data protocol Dat and the content addressing system IPFS.  It may not use a blockchain at all, though Torba told CoinDesk that it is looking at both EOS and Blockstack as potential platforms.  ""Nothing concrete set in stone right now. The truth is, all of this tech is super early and very unscalable,"" he wrote.  The company said it has a large number of anonymous technologists working with it now helping it to assess its options, which it calls the Alt-Tech Alliance, ""inspired by events that took place at Google last year when engineer James Damore was fired,"" Sanduja explained.  The engineer was let go in August for writing a memo arguing that men may be better suited for engineering roles at the company. It put out a call for the best of the best engineers to join, but that Alt-Tech Alliance's channel on Gab only has two posts.  Torba said:  ""The point of this ICO is to raise capital to build out a team to make Exodus happen. The goal is a censorship-resistant, open-source communication protocol that no government or corporation can censor.""

42380313,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Mpal,1517461247,$160 Million Stuck: Can Parity Still Shake Up Ethereum?,"When life gives you lemons to the tune of nearly $160 million, it's not so easy to make lemonade.  But that's just what ethereum startup Parity Technologies is seeking to do after a rough 2017, a year in which it suffered one of the most high-profile breaches in the history of blockchain. Far from a sinister hack, though, it's had to face that its fortunes effectively changed when a novice developer ""accidentally"" froze the funds so no one could access them.  Worse still, attempts at getting the money back don't exactly look promising.  Entering 2018, that could have an impact beyond just a single startup. Far from a conventional business, Parity supplies support for one of the two most widely used clients on ethereum, providing software roughly a quarter of the network uses to operate.  And like other blockchain conglomerates (think the ever-expanding Brooklyn startup ConsenSys), Parity has diverse interests. Also affected by the incident was the Web3 Foundation, the non-profit that oversees the development of the Polkadot blockchain, and it is also led by former ethereum CTO and Parity founder Gavin Wood.  The much-heralded blockchain for blockchains raised roughly $150 million in an ICO last year, and as reported by CoinDesk, funds lost in the Parity freeze included the ICO earnings.  As such, Ashley Tyson, a spokesperson for the Web3 Foundation, acknowledged that the loss to its operations has been felt. Plans to deploy bounties designed to fix code weaknesses and grant programs to spur development, she said, have been scrapped.  Tyson told CoinDesk:  ""With a majority of our funds frozen, we're not sure what our ability is to financially contribute to these initiatives. Certainly, it will need to be massively scaled back.""  Yet, the affected companies are rebuilding and continuing to develop their software, with some major projects proceeding almost as if nothing happened.  Technical progress  So far, the best example of Parity's ability to bounce back is the release this week of its node software, which improves the speed of its ethereum client while adding a range of updates.  A bigger and more long-term project, though, is their so-called ethereum ""bridge."" Based off an age-old idea in blockchain, the tech has been in development for a while, with Wood telling CoinDesk in November the project was 70 to 80 percent complete.  For now, the prototype can be used to connect the ethereum network with Kovan testnet, meaning users can send their funds to a special ethereum smart contract and locks those funds for use on an experimental version of ethereum.  Unlike the main blockchain, Kovan comes to consensus via a mechanism called ""proof-of-authority."" Though it's not as decentralized, it's still designed to make sure no one's making transactions they really shouldn't be making, replacing ethereum's miners with a set of approved authorities.  This is a first step. And if and when the project is finished, users will be able to seamlessly send their money in this way to any ethereum-like network.  Eventually this will be used to link ethereum to Polkadot, an idea described in the ""Polkadot white paper"" to connect many blockchains together with the help of incentives and game theory.  This is a pretty big step in and of itself, though, since the company is the first such ethereum ""bridge"" to connect two networks with such different underlying algorithms.  To put the project into context, they are trying to achievedsimilar functionality to sidechains, a long-promised bitcoin technology that has stalled for years due to security problems.  Despite the frozen funds, development updates show the bridge is still in progress, with the developers releasing a number of security improvements a couple weeks ago. One of the next big steps for the bridge is to move funds back and forth in a decentralized fashion.  ""We're getting all our ducks in a row. Soon it will be time to start machine gunning them down,"" Wood said.  Setting perspective  And for Wood, the hack is less of a debilitating loss and more of an expensive growing pain.  In interview, Wood and Parity Technologies developer Robert Habermeier both spoke in a manner that alluded to the nascent state of ethereum broadly, with Wood noting it only ""kind of"" works as it was envisioned today.  With this in mind, Wood is still confident Parity can make progress on technologies that will bolster the blockchain he helped found. (Wood was the author of the ethereum ""yellow paper"" and is responsible for much of its high-concept math).  ""For ethereum to continue its fairly staggering success story its gonna need to scale,"" he said, noting that's another thing Polkadot, moved along by the bridge prototype, can help.  Along these lines, Web3 Foundation is building on its plans to help develop the rest of the decentralization world, partnering with a range of ethereum projects with the same goal of keeping data in the hands of users.  It's hosting a workshop bringing together a number of budding decentralized exchanges in Berlin, Tyson told CoinDesk, and plans work with developers of encrypted peer-to-peer technologies that shield data passed around on blockchain networks.  Still, she stressed that Web3 Foundation won't be crystal clear about its budget for another couple of months, and it won't be able to contribute to the overall ethereum ecosystem as much as ot hoped.  And with technical ideas for recovering the funds shot down by other ethereum developers so far, there still might be hurdles to come.  Tyson told CoinDesk:  ""We would obviously like to find some way to recover the funds, but the process for that is still unclear. We will take time to engage the community on what their concerns, feedback and suggestions may be.""  Correction: An earlier version of the article misstated that a file deletion froze the funds.

FedEx, which is part of BiTA's standards board, launched a pilot program using blockchain to store data for dispute resolution, said vice-president of strategic planning and analysis Dale Chrystie. The project hopes to establish what data would be needed for a permanent ledger to ease disputes between customers sending and receiving goods through FedEx.  The shipping giant also wants to use blockchain to store its records, he said, expanding:  “We have millions of records a day in our system, and we think of blockchain as a secure chain of custody that could transform the logistics industry. We believe it holds a lot of promise in that space and would streamline all that data exchange in a very secure way.""
