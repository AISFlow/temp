42428155,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL68xh,1511384126,Bitcoin Gold Wallet Scam Nets $3 Million in Illicit Earnings,"More than $3.3 million has been stolen as part of an elaborate scam that took advantage of bitcoin users seeking to claim their share of the newly created cryptocurrency bitcoin gold.  Perpetrated by the operators of a website called mybtgwallet.com, the scheme prompted users to submit their private keys or recovery seeds as a means to generate bitcoin gold wallets, as seen on an Internet Archive snapshot. Shortly after users did so, however, the cryptocurrency holdings in their wallets were sent to different addresses.  At least $30,000 in ethereum, $72,000 in litecoin, $107,000 in bitcoin gold and more than $3 million in bitcoin were confiscated, according to self-reported numbers verified by CoinDesk.  In an interview, victims blamed the association of the website with the official bitcoin gold project as a source of the effectiveness of the operation.  One of the victims, Mikel Martin, explained to CoinDesk:  ""I reached this site by following the link at [the] bitcoingold.org official website so I trusted it. Yesterday afternoon I noticed both my BTC and BTG stored in that wallet were gone.""  Safety assurances?  Before the thefts became apparent, the team behind bitcoin gold – an effort to create a new version of bitcoin that would restrict the types of hardware that can be used for mining – promoted mybtgwallet.com on their Twitter account, assuring users that it was safe to use on multiple occasions.  The person behind the service was, to an extent, ingratiated in the nascent BTG community, including its Slack channel. The website was developed by a user named John Dass, though it is unclear whether this is the developer's actual name or a pseudonym.  Further, the Bitcoin Gold website also included a balance checking tool based on code that was shared on GitHub on their website for a brief period of time, though the window only asked for a wallet address and included a disclaimer that users shouldn't share private keys. The Bitcoin Gold team has clarified that the malicious code itself was never present on their official website.  Yet once the thefts became apparent, the news quickly spread.  An analysis of the site's code by Reddit user Uejji four days ago found that the site stored the recovery keys, which were later sent to the site's owner. The site claimed to be open-source, but all of the source code was changed on GitHub after the scam was initiated, said Torsten Sandor, a spokesperson for Exodus, a digital wallet whose users lost funds in the scam.  Some of the victims of the scam used this wallet, which allowed the company to put together how the scam operated for one of their users, he said.  ""The user gave his recovery seed to the site and his wallet emptied,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""This only happened with bitcoin gold. It's a very interesting fork ... I think it's extremely unfortunate that new investors, people who know little about crypto, started buying into it.""  Scam response  Representatives from the bitcoin gold say they're moving to figure out a remedy to the situation.  After first being made aware of the scam, the launched an internal investigation, according to spokesperson Edward Iskra. In a published statementhttps://bitcoingold.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Statement-on-MYBTGWALLET.pdf, Bitcoin Gold developers said they were ""working with security experts to get to the bottom of this issue,"" but did not clarify who these experts were.  Iskra told CoinDesk that, initially, John Dass claimed innocence during this investigation.  ""The investigation increasingly indicated that the original developer, 'John Dass,' was responsible for the fraud all along … He has dropped out of touch with us, as well,"" he said.  While Dass was in the bitcoin gold Slack channel with a ""developer"" tag, he was not a part of the project's formal team, Iskra said.  There was ""no formal relationship at all. He did interact with our devs in the Slack regarding developing his open-source code [and] his web site,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The BTG Twitter account was simply supporting an individual in the community who was supporting BTG – that was their sole intent, at the time.""  The Bitcoin Gold team will make a further announcement about their investigation within the next few days, Iskra said.

Mataruka went on to say:  ""In Southern Africa, what we have done as regulators, we have said that we will not allow [bitcoin] in our markets.""  However, it's not entirely clear from the statement whether Mataruka was saying that bitcoin is not legal tender within Zimbabwe – that is, an officially recognized currency – or actually prohibited more widely.  Still, Mataruka reportedly noted that research is being undertaken within the central bank to determine the risks associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, stressing that ""[bitcoin] will not be allowed"" until the central bank has drawn up a regulatory framework – a hint that some form of recognition could occur.  According to Chronicle, Zimbabwe's central bank has previously warned that people who are involved investing in cryptocurrencies could lose their funds without recourse.  Nor is it the first institution of its kind in the region to stake out a prohibitive stance toward the tech.  The central bank of Namibia announced last month that it would prohibit the formation of cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as ban bitcoin's use for goods and services payments.

42428144,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL68fh,1511356212,What's Next for Bitcoin Cash? Stopping User Fund Loss,"The rift between bitcoin and its offshoot bitcoin cash isn't just ideological – it's hazardous.  For months, a technical quirk has led some users of both cryptocurrencies to lose money, both temporarily and permanently. But it appears that nightmare scenario may soon be in the past, as bitcoin cash's developer team recently announced it is taking steps to address the problem.  To recap, bitcoin cash originally split from bitcoin earlier this summer in an attempt to experiment with a different long-term technical vision for the technology. For all their differences, though, it's their similarities that are causing the problem.  When bitcoin cash created a new blockchain from bitcoin's transaction history, it took much of the old code along with it, including the address format that users use to send money. The problem with that is, if users aren't paying attention, they can send bitcoin cash to their bitcoin addresses, or vice versa.  A quick google search unearths dozens of forum posts where users complain of this problem.  ""I accidentally sent my BTC to a BCC address. Is there a way to recover them? Is there somebody that can help me with this matter?"" pleaded one user on Bitcoin Stack Exchange, a technical forum.  ""It was about $500 worth. I feel like an idiot!"" said another requesting help.  The solution, however, is within reach: the address formats simply need to be changed so they aren't compatible. And Amaury Sechet, lead developer of Bitcoin ABC (a bitcoin cash software implementation), believes achieving this should be the project's next big step.  When announcing his work on a new address format called ""cashaddr,"" he called it a ""pressing"" change, contending that the change could be made as soon as December.  He added later:  ""In order to reduce confusion for users with the use of different addresses, I think it is important to deploy this shortly and stop the fragmentation of the ecosystem.""  The change  Unlike bitcoin cash's last big change, though, this one wouldn't need to be a hard fork, meaning not everybody needs to upgrade their software in order to stay on the network.  ""The 'key' to this, pun intended, is that the underlying public and private cryptographic key pairs won't change – just how they are represented as 'addresses' will look different in wallet software,"" Calin Culianu, who's contributed to the Bitcoin ABC software, told CoinDesk.  Still, he noted the upgrade will go smoother if everyone, including wallet providers, adopts the change in advance. That way, the whole ecosystem will be aware of the new addresses.  But what's interesting is that Sechet's proposal draws from changes first put forth by Bitcoin Core contributors, the volunteer development group behind bitcoin's main implementation.  Although bitcoin cash intends to compete with bitcoin, attempting to push fees lower, this willingness to take inspiration from bitcoin's main software implementation shows the two cryptocurrencies aren't on totally different paths.  ""We want the user experience to be flawless, especially with potentially significant amounts of money involved,"" said Bitcoin ABC contributor Shammah Chancellor.  Getting consensus  All that said, the jury's still out on whether the proposal will be adopted.  Developers argue it needs agreement from the bitcoin cash community. One developer, Roy Bagami, for example, agrees with ushering in a new address format but said he's ""not a big fan of bech32,"" the format Sechet's cashaddr based off of. So, he's proposed something else.  Another developer Freetrader released a ""community survey"" to get a more clear idea of sentiment.  Still, others defended the change. ""It's a good proposal,"" Chancellor told CoinDesk.  More broadly, developers have an optimistic outlook for the bitcoin offshoot, with Culianu arguing it's doing ""great,"" and he no longer feels the need to help out.  ""I was more interested in making sure it takes off and it has a shot back when they really needed manpower – now that Amaury Sechet has put together an even larger team and everything is going smoothly – I no longer felt a need to contribute,"" Culianu told CoinDesk.  Other contributors have proposed longer-term roadmaps with possible enhancements bitcoin cash could make down the line, such as addressing the ""transaction malleability"" bug. While they might be a hint of what's to come, they've mostly generated heated debate so far.  Either way, while an address format might seem like a small change, it could be a sign of further differentiation between bitcoin and bitcoin cash moving forward.

Having sat in the $80-$100 range since Sep. 18, monero first significantly broke above the $100 mark on Nov. 8 and has since continued to rally. Finally, at around 11:30 UTC today, monero peaked at a new record high of $156.09 – just topping the previous high of $154.58 set on Aug. 28.  At press time, prices were still climbing. The gains for the eighth largest cryptocurrency by total value mark a 14.59 percent rise over the last 24 hours, and on a weekly basis, monero is up 27.07 percent, as per CoinMarketCap.  As is becoming a common theme in price updates across various cryptocurrencies, South Korean trading seems to be playing a part in the buoyant monero market.  Again going by CoinMarketCap data, Korean exchange Bithumb is responsible for 31.64 percent of the trading volume. However, European exchange BitBTC and U.S.-based Poloniex are posting significant volumes at 15.07 and 14.30 percent, respectively.

Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, the country's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Emilio Aquino said that his agency could class ICO offerings as ""possible securities"" under the Securities Regulation Code, a Manila Times report said.  According to Aquino, the move is in line with regulations passed by the U.S. SEC, and other regulators in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand. Recognizing the growing popularity of the blockchain funding use case, he said regulators were eyeing rules to protect consumers.  The commissioner also revealed the SEC is currently in talks with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country's central bank, with regard to the licensing of cryptocurrency exchanges. Some companies have already been ""registered and endorsed"" by the BSP, he said, though they are restricted to money services businesses working in remittances.  The change could see other cryptocurrency exchanges allowed to function as money changers, central bank Governor Nestor Espenilla Jr. said yesterday, according to the source.  BSP has registered two exchanges so far, he indicated, and more are under evaluation.  Espenilla Jr. further indicated that BSP has an ""open mind"" toward fintech developments. ""This means that we take a very active role in ensuring that our policies provide opportunities for innovation,"" he added.  Earlier this year, the central bank released new guidelines for bitcoin exchanges operating in the country, suggesting that exchanges need to register with BSP and the country's Anti-Money Laundering Council Secretariat, and that they would be subject to ""registration and annual fee services.""

42400672,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKNlN,1511344801,Who Needs a CSD? Nivaura to Issue First Regulated Ether Bond,"Blockchain startup Nivaura has today initiated its first bond denominated exclusively in ether.  Built under the regulatory oversight of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the first-of-its-kind instrument was issued by London-based luxury retail startup LuxDeco and created with the help of industry leaders to give the company a new way to raise capital for short-term seasonal demand.  But what's truly disruptive about the issuance isn't the use of cryptocurrency, rather it's that the bond will be cleared, settled and registered on the public ethereum blockchain. With a relatively short lifecycle of only one week, the bond is also part of a larger experiment to see if removing financial middlemen can make such investment vehicles more accessible to small businesses on a massive scale.  ""As an entrepreneurial business we are always looking at ways to gain advantage and scale,"" said the founder and CEO of LuxDeco, Jonathan Holmes, in an interview with CoinDesk. ""So, if cryptocurrency becomes a valid funding and trading option we would definitely look at issuing further bonds in the future.""  And while private blockchains have largely been the purvey of CSDs and other legacy infrastructure providers, the founder and CEO of venture-backed Nivaura, Avtar Sehra, argued that the new bond shows the potential of public blockchains when applied to enterprise business models.  Sehra said:  ""What we're showing is you can use open public infrastructure for regulated financial instruments, and this is a very critical step, because from the earliest stages we've always believed that public blockchains are the way forward.""  Big name input  To ensure the ethereum bond aligned with existing workflows, a number of counterparties were involved in its creation.  As part of JPMorgan's in-residence program Nivaura received input for the development of an automated bookbuilding process that could be deployed for a number of different financial instruments. With the help of law firm Allen & Overy Nivaura then used that structure to construct legally compliant documentation that automated the work using ethereum smart contracts.  In turn, credit rating firm Moody's priced the instrument by providing data to generate yield curves, factoring the volatility of ethereum into the structure of the bond itself.  Specifically, while a control experiment (discussed in greater detail below) paid 2.5 percent annual interest, the ethereum bond is expected to offer annual interest of about 10 percent to help offset the perceived risk of using a cryptocurrency prone to rapid price fluctuations.  Ether used to purchase the bond was be deposited to a public address called the Nivaura Client ETH Account. To help conclude the process, investors, in turn, must confirm the account in which they'd like to receive principal and interest when the bond reaches maturity on Nov. 29.  While the entire process was designed to be as self-service as possible, a trustee service is also being provided by Australia-based Link Asset Services (previously known as Capita) in case the issuer defaults on the loan.  ""A blockchain can't do that,"" said Sehra, elaborating:  ""A blockchain can't go and enforce a contract and reclaim the assets for the investors. This is essentially where an accountable third party is always required.""    Bitcoin control        Yet, the ethereum bond issued today is just the latest of a two-part experiment designed to show how public blockchains could turn bond issuance into an increasingly self-service industry.  Considered a control group for comparison with the ethereum bond, the earlier work was conducted using the bitcoin blockchain, resulting in a more manual process in part due to expected difficulty writing smart contracts.  This bond was created last month as part of another regulatory sandbox similarly set up by the FCA to give the partners assurance they won't accidentally violate industry controls.  In spite of the difficulty automating some of this earlier work, end users were still afforded a degree of self-service, by using private keys assigned to them via a KYC/AML onboarding process built into the Nivaura platform.  The biggest difference between the tests was that instead of depositing the cryptocurrency directly to an account on the blockchain, as with the ethereum bond, British pounds were deposited into Nivaura's Client Money Account.  A document given by Nivaura to the counterparties explained the limitations of this arrangement:  ""This meant that the ownership of money on the blockchain could not be considered as the independent source of truth due to the dependency on, and management of, the funds held in a Client Money Account.""  Going forward  With the lessons learned from both of these live experiments, Nivaura and LuxDeco have plans for a number of further implementations.  LuxDeco's Holmes said he first discovered Nivaura in response to global customers who wanted to pay for their goods in ethereum and bitcoin – and if the bond matures without any problems, that's exactly what the firm would like to do next.  ""If we eventually start accepting payments in cryptocurrency, which we think will come, there is potentially a natural case for funding our working capital cycles through this means too,"" he said.  As for Nivaura, Sehra is mindful of other bond issuers such as Daimler, Fisco and Overstock who have used cryptocurrency for part of their process. As those companies, and others working in derivatives, make their own progress, he expects to see a convergence.  Sehra concluded:  ""We're already seeing derivatives in cryptocurrency. Bonds and derivatives are going to be the next step. They're going to be the next pioneers.""

42400667,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKNgS,1511337635,Banca IMI Researcher Explores Ethereum Derivatives,"A subsidiary of global banking giant Intesa Sanpaolo is taking steps to reimagine what the $1.2 quadrillion derivatives market might one day look like on a public blockchain.  In a new white paper released today, a researcher from Banca IMI details how an ethereum smart contract built by Intesa Innovation, Banca IMI and blockchain startup Oraclize makes it impossible for any counterparty to default by anticipating eventualities that might otherwise result from a legal dispute.  Written by the bank's head of interest rate and credit models, Massimo Morini, the paper represents a continuation of work he's been conducting at Banca IMI for two years. However, it also hints at what sets the bank apart in its approach to the blockchain sector.  While its peers have been largely working to resolve regulatory concerns and protect user confidentiality, Banca IMI has been focusing on the business of derivatives.  But in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk Morini also shed light on two other projects currently underway that he hopes could help inspire entirely new derivatives models using bitcoin and ethereum.  Morini said:  ""We tried to design a business model exploiting the technology such that from a financial point of view it works on the public blockchain, because the guarantees are so much stronger than those we have with standard technology.""  On-chain derivatives  In the paper, Morini opens with a detailed mathematical description of how collateralized derivatives meant to help offset risks can backfire.  While derivatives built on underlying assets such as cash, gold and bonds are constructed to minimize loss in more high-risk endeavors, what the report calls ""a generic paper contract"" might not specify data sources or algorithms implemented by the counterparties.  As a result of these uncertainties and others, discrepancies between the parties can result in default, delays and costly legal litigation. According to Morini, though, a smart contract executed on the ethereum blockchain could make this a problem of the past.  In the proof-of-concept (POC) detailed in the paper, a smart contract was built using an ethereum testnet that communicated contract details to an external computation engine located in the cloud.  Instead of risking delays and relying on courts to resolve possible disputes, Morini said the team's derivatives workflow builds the terms of resolution into the smart contract itself.  By anticipating problems and encoding solutions, he said his smart contract-based derivative could reduce delays from days to minutes and dramatically cut the cost of resolution.  ""In the end, it's enough that the smart contract keeps a little amount of funds to be used in case one stops paying, to guarantee that even if one stops paying, in a few hours, you are out of the contract and you have lost no money,"" he said, adding:  ""This is really a different business model from what we are used to seeing in standard financial markets, but financially, it works.""  Transitioning to the chain  But the potential solution developed by Morini's team can only go so far without some help from financial institutions.  Last year, the 18-year veteran of the bank wrote another paper about how the potential benefits of moving transactions to a distributed ledger would be mitigated if banks don't meet the change halfway.  As such, other projects currently underway afford users various degrees of privacy while the public blockchain use case matures.  One project employs a network of state channels designed to let counterparties send messages related to a derivative to each other off of the blockchain. The project, which is only in its earliest stages, is designed to ease concerns about privacy by only interacting with the public blockchain when a derivative terminates.  A third project — also being built with Intesa Sanpaolo, Banca IMI and Oraclize — aims to give users the highest levels of privacy by building private blockchains into a central counterparty clearing house (CCP) for trading derivatives.  ""In the long term, this may also mean the transformation of their business model, where you actually keep some elements of the current business model,"" he said. ""But also you improve in other elements and you create some more decentralization even in a fundamentally centralized business model.""  Obstacles ahead  But while Morini appears convinced of the superiority of public blockchains to service the derivatives market, he concedes one fundamental obstacle which has yet to be fully overcome: privacy.  To meet that demand, derivatives startups like LedgerX are already conducting increasingly complicated contracts using bitcoin, and the DTCC is using a private blockchain developed by Axoni to move its own derivatives to a blockchain.  Yet, even as one U.K financial regulator has warned against investing in derivatives that rely on cryptocurrencies, Morini remains convinced his work is headed towards a derivatives market that leverages the best of the old and the new.  He concluded:  ""The fundamental idea is to perform a change — a reform if you want — of the business model of financial derivatives to exploit in the best way the technology of the blockchain to get derivatives which are more transparent, which are more secure.""

CNBC received 43 responses from their Global CFO Council to a survey about their views bitcoin, with 12 of these respondents stating that it was “real but in a bubble,” and a further six saying it was “real and still going higher,” according to their results.  Another 12 respondents said they believe bitcoin is a fraud, with the remainder responding that they do not know enough about the cryptocurrency to say anything.  More CFOs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa think bitcoin is in a bubble than in the United States or the Asia-Pacific regions, according to the survey. Similarly, more CFOs in the former areas responded with the “fraud” moniker.  Roughly 21% of American CFOs think bitcoin is in a bubble, compared to about 29% in the Asia-Pacific area.  One of the CFOs on CNBC’s council, Solvay executive Karim Hajjar, said he was unsure about bitcoin.

42400675,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKNmM,1511326821,Enabling or Crippling? The Risks of State-by-State Blockchain Laws,"Andrea Tinianow is the director of Global Delaware. Joshua Ashley Klayman chairs the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance’s Legal Working Group.  In this opinion piece, Tianiow and Klayman consider whether so-called enabling legislation passed by a handful U.S. states is necessary for blockchain technology to flourish – and if so, some potential approaches.      When governments announce the adoption of blockchain legislation, even self-professed blockchain skeptics take notice. But are blockchain-enabling statutes really necessary in many cases, and could their passage lead to some unintended results?  To date, to our knowledge, four U.S. states have passed formal blockchain legislation. Such statutes authorize the use of blockchain technology for one or more functions, for instance: to conduct commerce (Arizona and Nevada); to introduce information into evidence (Vermont); and to maintain corporate records (Delaware). No doubt other states also are contemplating and, in some cases, actively working to draft and pass legislation authorizing the use of blockchain technology for some of the same – and perhaps, myriad other – functions.  Do we need permission?  It is exciting and, in many ways, laudable that Arizona, Delaware, Nevada and Vermont have taken leadership positions with respect to blockchain technology. By passing blockchain enabling statutes, those states arguably have signaled to the public and the market their confidence in the technology and, many believe, have given their imprimatur to the technology. These statutes appear to suggest, “Go ahead and use blockchain technology. We won’t penalize you for using it. You have our permission.”  But is it necessary? Do we need U.S. state governments to give their permission for the use of blockchain technology? Have there been other times at which we have called out a specific technology and required legislation to authorize its use? Why do we think we need to do it here? Will we have to go through this one more time to authorize the use of artificial intelligence?  And, if legislation is passed in one jurisdiction, what does that say about those jurisdictions that choose not to enact similar laws? Does that omission by a particular state somehow imply that such blockchain activity is invalid, illegal or not permitted there?  Many jurisdictions likely are struggling with these very questions, namely, whether specific legislation is required to authorize the use of blockchain technology and, if so, to what extent is such legislation required and with what degree of specificity?  In other words, how do we encourage blockchain innovation in all 50 states and across many sectors, including healthcare, education, banking, etc.? Do we identify every single function for which blockchain technology and smart contracts could be deployed, and then draft legislation accordingly?  Hopefully not. What a lengthy and cumbersome process that would be.  Risk of balkanization  Clearly, a scattershot approach among the 50 states (and cities, and counties) is not ideal when it comes to enacting blockchain legislation. Forethought and coordination among jurisdictions is important.  Otherwise, the result could be a hodgepodge of legislation covering different functions, with different standards, and different levels of specificity, potentially making nationwide blockchain solutions unduly complicated and perhaps commercially impracticable.  Without some degree of harmony across jurisdictions, even well-intentioned businesses that may have operations or customers located in or spanning more than one state may be faced with compliance challenges.  While it is true that there are many instances in which state laws differ from one another and that businesses may be accustomed to complying with such a tapestry of laws, a scattershot approach may result in a lack of clarity regarding whether the use of blockchain technology in a given state is permissible.  Even within a state, the passage of blockchain-enabling legislation with respect to certain functions and sectors also might suggest that those contemplating deploying blockchain technology for other functions and sectors not explicitly sanctioned may be prohibited.  Copying and pasting  In an effort to achieve coordination, some U.S. jurisdictions may consider copying their blockchain enabling legislation from another jurisdiction that already has passed it. This may be less than ideal for a number of reasons.  For instance, there may be legal differences and nuances across states that may not be evident from a plain reading of their respective statutes. Even identical statutory language in two different states may have different meanings, as that language may have been interpreted differently by different courts.  Merely grafting the same language, copycat style, onto another state’s statute is unlikely to be wise, absent considerable thought, analysis and planning.  Also, those states that have enacted blockchain enabling statutes may have encountered hurdles or complications that they had not foreseen at the time of passage. Based on their post-passage experiences, those states may recommend different approaches or language modifications, or might have approached the blockchain enabling legislation differently with the benefit of hindsight.  Insights should be sought from those states that have been leaders in passing blockchain technology before merely copying their blockchain enabling statutes or approaches.  A rule of thumb  With the goal of permitting blockchain enabling legislation to be truly enabling and not inadvertently crippling or confusing, we suggest that states consider enacting blockchain enabling laws only where the failure to enact such legislation would perpetuate existing – or create new – ambiguity about whether the technology’s use is permissible, or where the existing state laws preclude the deployment of the technology altogether.  Ambiguity about the permissibility of blockchain technology use may exist, for example, when an existing law contemplates that an enumerated function be performed by one or more human beings (as opposed to by technology).  This was the case in Delaware. Before enactment of the “Blockchain Amendments” to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute had contemplated that a corporate officer (a human being) would have charge of a corporation’s stock ledger. The amendments modified the corporate law to expressly allow performance of the administrative function of maintaining a corporation’s stock ledger by use of a network of databases (i.e., a blockchain), with certain qualifying requirements.  In our view, states that are exploring whether and how to enact blockchain legislation may benefit from considering which of their statutes contemplates or requires intervention by a human intermediary (like a corporate officer under the prior Delaware law), and then consider amending the law accordingly.  In circumstances and for functions where state laws do not preclude the deployment of blockchain technology or create legal ambiguity regarding the permissibility of, the adoption or use of blockchain technology, we suggest that the passage of specific blockchain enabling legislation not only may be unnecessary, but also may have unintended or confusing effects.  The views expressed are solely their own. The authors thank Lewis Cohen, Matt O’Toole and Aaron Wright for their contributions.
