42404729,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkR8V,1592512668,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Quiet at $9.3K While DeFi Gets Loud,"It’s a lethargic Thursday across most markets, including bitcoin. Yet, on a longer-term view, the big growth story remains the Ethereum network’s DeFi movement, which continues to help drive ether’s performance in 2020.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,395 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 0.97% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Thursday (8:00 p.m. Wednesday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,443 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. It then dipped to as low as $9,365. While the charts were relatively flat Thursday, the price was below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages - a bearish signal for market technicians who study charts.      Yet, not everyone sees the daily market action as bearish overall.      “I'm not bearish until sub-$8,500,” said Josh Rager, a cryptocurrency trader and founder of educational platform Blackroots. “I'm not ruling out a pump, but we need to reclaim $9,800!”      Read More: Bitcoin Still Undervalued After Q2 Rally, Price Metric Shows      Traders like action, and this week has been bereft of it so far. However, it is not stopping some from scooping up $9,400 bitcoin, said Michael Gord, CEO and co-founder of brokerage Global Digital Assets. “There has always been a brief accumulation phase following each halving and each accumulation phase has gotten longer as the market has matured,” he told CoinDesk.      Read More: Bitcoin Halving 2020, Explained      ""The market has been very flat over the month of June,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for digital asset brokerage Bequant. “But there is room for a break out next week heading into options and futures expiry dates.”      Indeed, there are a number of bitcoin options expiring next week, on June 26, according to data aggregator Skew.    Ether beating bitcoin in 2020    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), is trading around $230, climbing 0.64% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). So far in 2020, ether is up 77% while bitcoin has appreciated 30%.      Traders point to the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications being constructed on the Ethereum network as fundamental drivers of more people buying ether, causing the price to go up.      Read More: Compound Has Been a DeFi Darling. Its New Token Is Priced Accordingly      Over the past week, total value locked in DeFi has jumped 28%, closing in on $1.2 billion.      However, Michael Arrington, founder of Arrington XRP Capital, a fund that currently is using 80% of its assets for trading various cryptocurrencies, says narratives can change quickly in this market. “This year the story so far has been ether. But it might end up being bitcoin again,” he said.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mixed Thursday.      The biggest cryptocurrency winners on the day include lisk (LSK) climbing 2.3% and nem (XEM) in the green 2.1%. Significant losers include decred (DCR) dipping 1.9% and dogecoin (DOGE) in the doghouse down 1.3%. All price changes were as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      In commodities, oil is the lone asset making gains Thursday, jumping 3%. A barrel of crude was priced at $38.84 as of press time.      Gold is trading flat as the yellow metal slipped 0.08%, trading around $2,724 for the day.

42432138,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9w9h,1592512628,FTX Releases COMP Derivatives to Keep Up With DeFi Frenzy,"Derivatives market and crypto exchange FTX is moving into the storm created by Compound's new governance token, COMP.      Traders will soon be able to place their bets on which way decentralized finance (DeFi) will go, CoinDesk has learned.      Later Thursday, FTX and FTX US will both list COMP as well as cUSDT, the Compound version of tether (USDT). On the global site, FTX will also open its suite of crypto derivatives, allowing users to take leveraged bets on the token's prices looking down the road.      ""For basically all of DeFi, MakerDAO has been the king of DeFi, and it has had the canonical tokens,"" FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""One thing the markets are implying right now is that Compound is making a serious run for that crown.""      Read more: A Coinbase Pro Listing and Other Eye-Opening Data Points on Compound’s Surge in Demand      Since users of Compound began earning COMP tokens for borrowing and lending on June 15, the total value locked has shot up over $300 million, from less than $100 million on Sunday.      Compound currently has $318 million staked on the platform, according to Defi Pulse, and the COMP token is trading at $170, according to CoinGecko.      Incorporating COMP derivatives on FTX, although not in the United States, opens up a variety of positions traders can take.      ""These will be the first futures on Compound by a longshot,"" Bankman-Fried said.      He expects the most popular product will be the perpetual futures markets. These are futures that let traders take a long or short position on a product without needing to worrying about renewing their contracts.      ""It's a futures contract that never expires,"" Bankman-Fried explained, saying it's one of those products that are relatively unheard of outside of crypto.    Gut check    Bringing a market for short positions could actually be healthy for Compound's users.      The arrival of COMP has created a strange situation where users can potentially borrow money and profit, SesameOpen's Henry He detailed on Medium earlier this month. At some point, the number of people earning COMP and the price of COMP will reach an equilibrium where some users will decide it no longer makes sense to keep going deeper into debt. A market for short positions should help bring some clarity.      Bankman-Fried said he's been curious about the endpoint of COMP's runaway growth, too. ""I don't know at what point it stops,"" he said.      Read more: COMP’s Sudden Growth Has Swamped a DEX Dealing Only in Stablecoins      Besides adding COMP, incorporating cUSDT allows FTX users to use a token for collateral on FTX that actually earns interest.      When users deposit funds in Compound, they get a new ERC-20 that represents that deposit. For USDT, that's cUSDT. This makes their deposits tradable and it also means users can earn interest on their deposits wherever they hold the token.      So for FTX users that switch from USDT to cUSDT as their collateral token, it creates a small built-in hedge for those users. FTX hasn't yet determined how COMP earned for any trader holding cUSDT will be managed, but either way holders of cUSDT are earning 0.50% annual percentage yield as of this writing. Further, this is the first time users can easily acquire cUSDT without going directly to Compound.      FTX US does not offer the derivatives product but it does offer a large amount of liquidity and margin trading for certain customers, Bankman-Fried said. FTX US only went live in May.      ""We're really excited to give our users access to Compound's products . It's a huge step forward for DeFi and also a really active project right now,"" Bankman-Fried said.",POSITIVE,COMP | USDT,COMP | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/18/ftx-releases-comp-derivatives-to-keep-up-with-defi-frenzy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f807928596230d64695a6812c8fedd1ed92c3ae1-1665x1111.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432131,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9vxh,1592510624,Reddit Seeks Scaling Solution for Ethereum-Based 'Community Points',"Reddit is anticipating big demand for its Ethereum-based “Community Points” system only one month after rolling out the product.      Now the social media site is looking for a scaling solution.      Posted in the r/Ethereum subreddit Thursday, Reddit announced a partnership with the Ethereum Foundation to find a Layer 2 (L2) scaling technique for the site’s 430 million users. Community Points are earned by garnering “upvotes” on posts and can be used to purchase specialized GIFs or emojis.      Following CoinDesk’s request for comment, Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Ayako Miyaguchi tweeted:      Read more: Reddit Rolls Out ‘Community Points’ on Ethereum to Incentivize Positive Behavior      A blockchain for decentralized applications, Ethereum has been eyeing various scaling techniques since its mainnet launch in 2015.      The scaling debate has been siloed into two parts: Current work on Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain called Eth 1.x and the future Eth 2.0 update, which promises “unbounded” scaling via two technologies called Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding. Eth 2.0, sometimes referred to as Serenity, remains a highly technical project with no firm timeline, though an initial phase is tentatively slated for later this year.      Conversely, Ethereum’s Devcon 5 in Osaka, Japan, in October 2019, exhibited product-ready L2 options such as ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups from the Plasma coding group, now operating under the name Optimism. For example, decentralized exchange IDEX currently trades on its own variant of the product.      Read more: Ethereum’s Top DEX Is Rebooting With New Scaling Features      However, Reddit is looking for a product that is focused on social media. As the post notes, most L2 solutions have focused on exchanges, which require fast transaction times that most blockchains cannot handle.      “Many of these designs don’t take into consideration the costs of obtaining tokens or entering the scaling system, which can be significant,” the post states. “Community Points distributions have cost an order of magnitude more gas than all other operations combined, primarily due to on-chain storage costs associated with onboarding new users.”      Applicants are asked to submit proofs-of-concept by July 31 with reviews concluded by September. Unfortunately for these Reddit developers, the only reward is notoriety.      “This is your chance to earn some fame but, to be clear, there is no prize if your solution is chosen or modified to meet Reddit’s needs. Our lawyer made us write this,” the post states.

42432142,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9wJh,1592509776,Delta Exchange Launches Crypto Interest Rate Swaps,"It was only a matter of time before crypto adapted elements of the $341 trillion interest rate swap market to its own. Traders may now be able to hedge the risks they face from interest rate payment fluctuations in perpetual contracts. And it could also help those lending and borrowing in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      On June 9, the Singapore-based Delta Exchange launched interest rate swaps (IRS) - a contractual agreement between two parties to exchange interest rate payments over a set period of time.      Usually, an IRS involves the exchange of floating rate and fixed-rate obligations (the parties do not exchange the principal amount). A floating interest rate is the one that moves up and down with the reference rate.      In traditional finance, an interbank interest rate like Libor often serves as a reference rate in a swap. Delta’s interest rate swaps offer floating to fixed swaps using cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX's bitcoin perpetual (XBT/USD) funding rate as the reference, which helps tether the price of the contract to bitcoin's spot price.      See also: A Coinbase Pro Listing and Other Eye-Opening Data Points on Compound’s Surge in Demand      The funding rate is positive when the perpetuals trade at a premium to the spot price, indicating stronger buying pressure. In that case, longs pay funding to shorts. On the other hand, when perpetuals trade at a discount to the spot market, the funding rate is negative and shorts pay funding to longs. Funding occurs every eight hours at 04:00 UTC, 12:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC, and traders receive funding only if they hold positions at one of these times.      The BitMEX funding rate is usually positive and tends to hover in the 15%-20% range in anualized terms. However, it does rise or fall sharply during bouts of sudden price rally or crash.      A significant chunk of a trader’s profit can evaporate due to fluctuations in the funding rate if a position is held for a long time. That risk could be hedged with the interest rate swaps.      Assuming the funding rate is positive, a trader holding a long position on BitMEX can turn his floating funding rate liability into fixed cost by buying a floating-for-fixed contract for the same notional size as the XBT/USD position. Essentially, the trader would pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate. Meanwhile, traders with a short position on BitMEX can sell floating-for-fixed contracts.      If the funding rate turns negative, the direction of floating payments will reverse, but the hedge will stay intact, according to the official blog.    Speculation    Pankaj Balani, CEO and founder of Delta Exchange said, “IRS is also for traders who do not have any exposure to these rates but just want to speculate on rates rising or falling over time.”      A speculator can buy a floating-for-fixed contract if interest rates are expected to rise over a specific period of time. ""The trade will be profitable if the realized value of floating rate is higher than the expected value baked into the fixed rate,"" according to Delta Exchange.      The exchange collects fixed payments up front at the trade inception, and disburses floating (funding) payments every eight hours (4 a.m. UTC, 12 p.m. UTC and 8 p.m. UTC), in sync with funding exchanges on BitMex.      “Delta has registered a notional volume of $2 million since inception,” Balani told CoinDesk. Activity could continue to rise with the increase in the institutional participation in the crypto markets.      Indeed, in traditional finance, interest rate derivatives are the largest traded contracts on organized exchanges as well as in the over-the-counter markets globally. For the second half of 2019, the notional amount of interest rate swaps globally was over $342 trillion and valued at nearly $7.5 trillion, according to data compiled by the Bank of International Settlements.    Swaps for DeFi    Besides traders and speculators, interest rate swaps may find a market with those involved in decentralized finance (DeFi).      ""IRS on Delta Exchange will be super helpful for crypto companies that borrow stablecoins from lending protocols like Compound Finance and MakerDAO by keeping ether as collateral,"" said Balani.      Interest rates in the DeFi space are determined by the interaction between demand and supply forces, and are quite volatile.      For instance, yields on the stablecoin tether (USDT) offered by Compound surged earlier this week following the impressive debut of the protocol’s new COMP token. Notably, interest on USDT loans rose above 15% from 3% and were last seen at 8%, according to data source Defirate.com.      See also: COMP’s Sudden Growth Has Swamped a DEX Dealing Only in Stablecoins      Just like those trading in perpetual contracts, a USDT borrower can hedge risk by executing a buy of floating-for-fixed contracts on Delta.      Delta exchange announced early Thursday that it will soon be launching interest rate swaps for stablecoin USDC and dai. Thus, companies that borrow MakerDAO's dai and need to pay the volatile stability fee as interest can also hedge. ""That stability fee is variable and it exposes the borrower to risk of rising interest rates. IRS will help such companies swap the variable interest rate risk with a fixed risk,"" Balani told CoinDesk.      Compound CEO Robert Leshner said that ""interest rate swaps will give sophisticated traders an opportunity to more easily access, hedge, and arbitrage floating interest rate markets like Compound - leading to more stable, and less volatile financial products.""",POSITIVE,USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/18/delta-exchange-launches-crypto-interest-rate-swaps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ffb7645c10ee9fae897ac2d7bd4a46e6cc140c71-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432129,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9vnh,1592502694,Crypto.com Tech Upgrade Paves Way for Derivatives Trading,"Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com has revamped its digital exchange.      The new upgrades are expected to increase the performance and throughput of the exchange tenfold, the company announced Thursday. Changes include improvements to speed, scalability and security.      The Crypto.com exchange launched in beta at the end of last year. The exchange is one of many services offered on the platform alongside currency accounts, debit cards and a mobile app. Company co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek told CoinDesk the firm is planning to end the trial phase by the end of the year, and the infrastructure upgrades are expected to pave the way for new features including margin trading and derivatives trading.      Read more: Crypto.com Rolls Out Visa Card to 31 European Nations      “With the enhanced performance of the exchange and new features in the pipeline, we want to eliminate any reason for users to go elsewhere, and function as their trusted ‘one-stop shop’ for their digital asset needs,” Marszalek said in an email.      CIO Matthew Chan told CoinDesk that to accommodate new features, Crypto.com had to change the foundation on which the exchange was built.      “What we did here was essentially the equivalent of changing the engine on an airplane mid-flight,” Chan said in an email.    Under the hood    According to Chan, the tenfold increase in performance is thanks to a revamped matching engine and order management system. For high-frequency traders, this would translate into faster response times, stability and access to real-time data.      Chan also took on the improvement of scalability, or processing capabilities, during peak transaction traffic.      “The aim we had when making our adjustments was to build a dynamic system which in theory can scale infinitely,” Chan said.      Crypto exchanges are vulnerable to attacks, with users losing their currency held in exchanges or wallets online. Crypto.com holds 100% of user funds offline in cold storage. According to Marszalek, this is not something the platform is willing to change, despite opening it up to increased transaction volumes.      Read more: Users See ‘Buying Opportunity’ in Coronavirus Market Downturn, Says Crypto.com      “This was a golden opportunity for us to reassess all elements of our architecture, and fully integrate DevSecOps into our development lifecycle,” Chan added. “The tech stack, internal communications and other major aspects of all systems have been carefully reviewed, and stress-tested by both internal and external ethical hackers.”      For Marszalek, the new upgrades are part of a larger vision. Crypto.com was founded by Marszalek in 2016 as Monaco, a payment platform with its own MCO token. In 2017, the company’s initial coin offering raised $26.7 million. The next year, Monaco was rebranded as Crypto.com, which currently holds $360 million in cryptocurrency insurance.      “Our three core business pillars consist of payments, trading and lending. As of today, trading is the biggest contributor to our bottom line,” Marszalek wrote in an email.

42432126,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9vrh,1592497262,Novogratz: Galaxy Digital Will 'Suck' if Bitcoin Fails to Become an Institutional Asset,"With Galaxy Digital now working on an educational course for financial advisers, founder Mike Novogratz told CoinDesk he hopes it will help finally kick-start the institutional use of bitcoin, and turn around the asset manager's fortunes.      Novogratz, a Wall Street veteran, loves a compelling narrative. ""Bitcoin specifically is a story about adoption,"" he said a few minutes into our call. ""And the next big group that's going to adopt bitcoin as a store of value, as a digital gold, are the financial advisers.""      Earlier this week, Galaxy Digital announced it had partnered with the educational arm of CAIS, a financial product platform that specializes in connecting institutional investors – financial advisers, hedge funds, private equity – to alternative investments and products.      The tie-up will see Galaxy provide educational content about crypto to wealth managers and financial advisors. Although the course will offer material on the broader digital asset space, as well as on the emerging market infrastructure, it will revolve around bitcoin.      It's a ""really sweet partnership,"" Novogratz said. Galaxy can make bitcoin's investment case directly to the strata of society that controls most of the country's wealth. ""CAIS is spectacularly situated to help us educate them and then connect with them to sell our products.""      See also: Galaxy’s Novogratz: XRP Will ‘Underperform Immensely Again This Year’      Indeed, going back to the narrative, Novogratz has long believed institutional involvement was the natural next step for crypto. While it may have started out as a ""retail-driven, people's revolution,"" he predicted institutions would always get involved as the asset class grew in size.      Novogratz saw a gap. As a crypto merchant bank, Galaxy offers clients asset management and advisory services; it uses its own capital to trade and invest in the space. It would become the bridge, allowing traditional capital to flow into the nascent crypto space.      While Galaxy got off to a flying start, such as a high-profile investment into Block.one, the bank's performance over the past two years has been anything but spectacular.    My mom told me money doesn't grow on trees, and right now it's growing on trees.    In fact, Galaxy has failed to turn a profit since its launch: it lost a whopping $272.7 million in its first full year of operation. It rode the market rebound in the summer of 2019, but still lost $97 million in Q4 2019. Losses stemming from the its trading arm have wiped out its other revenue streams. A pear-shaped investment into WAX, a gaming token, for example, lost the firm as much as $47 million      In order to keep itself going, Galaxy has been forced to shrink its workforce by 15%. But it may not be out of the woods yet. The bank warned earlier this year that the coronavirus outbreak would likely contribute to a further hit to revenue.      Novogratz is confident, however, that institutions can help turn his company's fortunes around. It has taken longer than expected, he admits, but says he has this ""intuition"" that there's ""going to be a big [institutional] take up in the next six to 24 months.""      See also: Binance Launching Crypto Exchange in the UK      What makes him so sure? It's all about the narrative, he said.      ""We would not be having this conversation if, you know, [the U.S.] budget deficit was going from 4% to 2% and everything looked hunky-dory,"" he said. ""In one week after the coronavirus crisis started, the [Federal Reserve] did more QE than it did in the entire 2008-2009 episode.""      ""My mom told me money doesn't grow on trees, and right now it's growing on trees,"" he said.      Novogratz belongs to the school of thought that sees bitcoin ultimately becoming the digital equivalent to gold: a store of value, uncorrelated to the traditional markets. As such, this darkening macro backdrop is ""fantastic"" for the story of bitcoin.      The smart money is buying bitcoin as a macro hedge, Novogratz said. Paul Tudor Jones, he says, is a perfect example of a well-known figure from the traditional space, who has seen the narrative and has begun allocating bitcoin to his fund. And that could open the flood gates for other institutions.      Indeed, it does feel like institutional investors are getting more interested in bitcoin. Last Month, Fidelity found that 80% of those surveyed found the asset class appealing. The likes of Coinbase, Gemini and BitGo are racing to launch prime brokerages for an institutional crowd.      ""The drumbeat from the financial advisory committee on wanting to learn more about bitcoin and blockchain has been increasing,"" said Matt Brown, founder and CEO of CAIS.      See also: Bakkt, Galaxy Digital to Offer Bitcoin Trading, Custody Solution for Institutions      Which brings us back to why Galaxy is getting involved in CAIS. Novogratz said most of the content they plan to use had already been developed over the past three years. It had been collecting dust till last week. When they had tried to publish it before, institutions simply weren't interested.      Novogratz says now is the perfect opportunity to use his course to proselytize about bitcoin and drive home the narrative that bitcoin is the new gold. ""This education piece is selling the story,"" getting institutional investors comfortable with the asset so they'll potentially encourage other institutions to do the same, he said.      Crucially, it will also provide Galaxy with the opportunity to connect with thousands of financial advisors who, between them, control more than a trillion dollars in wealth.      Looking back, Novogratz realizes Galaxy Digital, as a bridge for institutions into crypto, came too early. ""Quite frankly,"" he said, ""the consumer business was the easier play."" Even now, businesses such as exchanges, wallets, and platform providers, which cater for a retail audience, are, in his mind, still performing best in crypto.      But by talking to investors about the ""bitcoin story,"" Novogratz wants to be a key part of a sea change. His partnership with CAIS, he said, could be the ""first big leg of more traditional capital coming into the space.""      ""It's taken longer to get there than I thought it would, but it feels like we're finally through the starting line and starting to gain some pace.""      See also: Custody Battle Pits Institutional Boomers Against Crypto Upstarts      But, CoinDesk asked, what happens if bitcoin doesn't become this great institutional asset? If, after educating financial firms about crypto for a whole year, few roll their sleeves up and get involved?      ""If very few hedge funds get into the space, then my company's going to suck,"" Novogratz said. Galaxy can keep investing in businesses and trading crypto, ""but the real core of what we're trying to is build this connectivity to institutions. If they don't come, you know, we're a little shit out of luck.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/18/novogratz-galaxy-digital-will-suck-if-bitcoin-fails-to-become-an-institutional-asset,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/beb0e7bc9cc780ee75c24b90ed10d2fc3132615c-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432133,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9vth,1592496903,A Coinbase Pro Listing and Other Eye-Opening Data Points on Compound’s Surge in Demand,"It's hard to pick just one stunning fact about the market suddenly created by the issuance of Compound's COMP token.      Since Monday, when the governance token started being released to users of the decentralized lending platform, the total value locked (TVL) on Compound has broken $200 million for the first time, according to DeFi Pulse, and it's decisively on its way to $300 million. At $283 million as of press time, the prior all-time high for Compound's TVL occurred Feb. 23 when it reached $183 million.      The question, of course, is why.      This has been a wild week in decentralized finance (DeFi) as users scramble to earn the daily rewards of COMP, currently priced at $123, according to data site CoinGecko. As previously reported by CoinDesk, users are depositing one token (usually USDC) and borrowing another (usually USDT), because Compound emits fresh COMP every day to both lenders and borrowers.      In many cases, borrowers turn around and convert the borrowed USDT to USDC in order to repeat the operation and maximize their COMP earnings.      Read more: COMP’s Sudden Growth Has Swamped a DEX Dealing Only in Stablecoins      From 12:00 UTC to 13:00 UTC on Thursday, Compound's TVL shot up $50 million.      It's not unfair to say the DeFi market has been completely overtaken by Compound this week. A few relevant data points:    Coinbase Pro announced Thursday it will list COMP next week. CoinDesk has not been able to confirm yet whether or not this is Coinbase's fastest listing to date. Coinbase invested in Compound's $8.2 million seed round in 2018.  More than 10% of the total supply of USDC, the stablecoin created by Circle and Coinbase, is currently locked on Compound.  The total amount of tether (USDT) on Compound is up almost 8,000% since June 11, noted crypto investor Spencer Noon, who also added a note of caution.  CoinFlip, which runs a bitcoin ATM network in the U.S., announced Thursday it would list USDC on its machines, partly due to COMP-related demand, a spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk.  Every day since its initial release, COMP has had more volume on the stablecoin exchange Curve than any day prior, though it has slowed down since Tuesday evening.  Compound is the only DeFi market besides MakerDAO to break $200 million in TVL, according to DeFi Pulse.    As long as the token's price remains above $100, the effective market cap of COMP is over a billion dollars, though it should be noted that this price is skewed by the fact that so little of the supply is actually liquid.      To recap, 2,880 COMP tokens are released to borrowers and lenders on Compound each day. Only 9,231 of the 4.2 million set aside for community members have been released so far, according to the Compound website.      Read more: First Mover: Compound Has Been a DeFi Darling. Its New Token Is Priced Accordingly      Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner of Dragonfly Capital, put the long-term prospects of Compound and the short-term reality of its governance token into context in an email to CoinDesk Thursday:    ""Given that COMP represents a potential claim on future interest paid, as more collateral onboards to Compound, this should make COMP more valuable as more lenders/borrowers show up. (In the short term though, most of COMP's price fluctuations are a function of the tiny float. Think Zcash early days. I wouldn't read too much into the current price.)""",POSITIVE,COMP | USDC,COMP | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/18/a-coinbase-pro-listing-and-other-eye-opening-data-points-on-compounds-surge-in-demand,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41d723cf87449476b0fab53a3a45893235499d53-1500x834.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432130,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9vvh,1592496606,Infosec Exec Urges US Lawmakers to Tighten Crypto Regs Over Pandemic-Driven Scams,"Cryptocurrencies should be regulated more stringently, a VMWare security executive told U.S. lawmakers, citing a rise in cybercrime during the pandemic.      The focus of Tuesday’s hearing, hosted by a House Financial Services subcommittee, was criminal activity around financial services during the COVID-19 lockdowns, when bad actors online are targeting people who are unemployed or working from home. But crypto made an appearance, with lawmakers questioning witnesses about its potential uses in fraud or organized crime.      Tom Kellermann, head of cybersecurity strategy at publicly traded software company VMWare, told lawmakers that virtual currencies need stronger oversight. There has been an increase in the number of security breaches and thefts at digital currency exchanges, which cybercriminals used to launder stolen money, he said.      “In addition to organized crime, extremist organizations are also known to use alternative payment systems for operational purposes and to raise funds. Many of these payment systems and cryptocurrencies offer true or relative anonymity. This raises the necessity of increased regulation of digital money,” Kellermann said during his opening remarks.      He urged the House members to pressure their Senate colleagues to pass a bill that would revise requirements related to anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing laws. He also suggested charging the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a monitoring body of the Treasury Department, with the responsibility of creating a framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and developing guidelines for strong protections against money laundering as well as cyber threats to those marketplaces.    Blast from the past?    In his testimony, Kellermann claimed social media platforms are rife with advice on ""regarding jihadists’ potential use of Dark Wallet, a bitcoin wallet that provides anonymity.""      The use of capital letters in his written statement suggests he was referring specifically to Dark Wallet, one of the earliest anonymizing bitcoin wallets. That project appears to have been inactive for some time; the last code update was made in 2016, according to its GitHub page.      Later, Kellermann and Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio) used the phrase in a seemingly generic sense, to refer to anonymizing services.      See also: US Lawmaker Proposes Legislative Groundwork for National Blockchain Strategy      ""You also talk about Dark Wallet as a platform where jihadists can avoid your customer regulations and launder money,"" Gonzalez said to Kellermann. ""My question is, do we technologically, do we have the ability to shut down something like a dark wallet? Is that technologically possible?""      “I wouldn't be an advocate of let's say, shutting it down,” Kellermann replied.      Instead, he said he would challenge the developers of the platforms to be able to freeze assets associated with anything that has been proven to be part of a criminal or terrorist conspiracy, when called upon.      “I think the FBI, Secret Service and the intelligence communities do have the capacity to do more interesting things. But then again, I'm just a watcher on the wall, sir, I don't have that much expertise vis-à-vis dark wallets,” Kellermann said.    Sherman weighs in    Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), who once said Libra could be worse than 9/11, expressed concerns about cryptocurrency-based fraud.      Many scams identified by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) during the pandemic potentially involved cryptocurrency investments, he said. In his view, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has resisted identifying cryptocurrencies as securities.      “I believe that the lack of SEC registration requirements makes cryptocurrencies attractive to those who have investment scams,” Sherman said.      He went on to ask Amanda Senn, NASAA representative and chief deputy director of the Alabama Securities Commission, what Congress can do to correct a system where investors aren't protected.      “We have a regulatory framework for investments in cryptocurrency,” Senn responded, referencing a state-level campaign focused on educating investors about initial coin offerings (ICO) and online scams.      “I do believe that particularly the state can be more proactive in preventing types of fraud that are prevalent,” Senn said.    Forfeiture fund    Kellermann said fintech companies must be given clear incentives to guard against intrusion and learn anti-money-laundering protocols outlined by the Bank Secrecy Act.      He suggested that funds seized in cybercrime, including those involving cryptocurrencies, should be redirected through a forfeiture fund to strengthen cybersecurity.      “Given that 50% of all crimes now have a cyber component, it's high time that we follow the money to create an international forfeiture fund,” Kellermann said.      Gonzalez asked how such a fund could become a reality.      “We need to [incentivize] developing countries to play ball with us,” Kellermann responded.      See also: This Is What a Productive Congressional Blockchain Hearing Looks Like      Giving governments a percentage of the forfeited assets in an investigation can motivate nations to take a stronger position on cybercrime, he said.      An international fund would be the best option considering most cyberattacks against the U.S. originate elsewhere, he added, suggesting that the Bank of International Settlements, the central bank of central banks, might be well suited to this task.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/18/infosec-exec-urges-us-lawmakers-to-tighten-crypto-regs-over-pandemic-driven-scams,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76e19ab839cdd09177fd0c0a068d4741e6c0270c-1431x786.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432140,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9wFh,1592496576,"Blockchain Bites: Trump on Bitcoin, Powell on Digital Dollars and the Truth About Terrorist Financing","The Washington Examiner published an excerpt of John Bolton's new book detailing a dramatic scene in which President Trump told Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to go after bitcoin before tackling trade with China.      This news follows a report from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) showing how the agency failed to properly oversee crypto investigations, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's statement that a ""digital dollar"" should be investigated. Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Who Watches the Watchdogs? The DEA failed to adequately police its undercover agents’ handling of cryptocurrency, according to the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (IG). “The DEA’s management of virtual currency-related activities was insufficient due to inadequate headquarters management, lack of policies, inadequate internal control procedures, insufficient supervisory oversight and lack of training,"" the IG wrote. Elsewhere, President Donald Trump ordered Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to focus on a clampdown on bitcoin over negotiating a trade with China, according to an excerpt from former National Security Advisor John Bolton's new book.      Officials Weigh In Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking before the House Financial Services Committee, said the idea of a digital dollar should be taken seriously, adding later, “this is something that the central banks have to design… The private sector is not involved in creating the money supply, that’s something the central bank does.” Elsewhere, Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said XRP is more like an alternative currency than a security. He argued Ripple Labs hadn’t violated any U.S. securities regulations and should have the same legal status as bitcoin or ether. Halfway across the world, Russia’s Ministry of Justice criticized a new draft bill prohibiting crypto operations in the country, a week after the Ministry of Economic Development also opposed it. The bill is believed to be the brainchild of the country’s central bank, which has a prohibitive approach to crypto.      Missing Funds A district judge has denied two requests for subpoenas filed by iFinex, in its bid to track $850 million in user funds seized by authorities after bank accounts held by its payment processor, Crypto Capital, were frozen. It appears the subpoenas were filed in the wrong district. Elsewhere, Wirecard AG, a German payment processor and an issuer of Crypto.com and TenX debit cards, is unable to locate 1.9 billion euros (over $2 billion) worth of cash balances on its trust accounts, after an EY audit. The firm said a third party may have added “spurious” balances “in order to deceive the auditor,"" The Block reports. Finally, a new report shows that cryptocurrency is not a significant trend in terror financing in the Middle East. However, a new round of U.S. sanctions aimed at Syria may tip the scales in favor of experimentation.      Platform Growth Polkadot has announced a proof-of-concept token redeemable for bitcoin (BTC). Designed by Interlay, the system will lock BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain and mint a PolkaBTC token on Polkadot, in effort to boost the interoperability of the network. Elsewhere, the South Korean soccer association K League announced a licensing agreement with the blockchain enabled fantasy soccer platform Sorare to enable fans to collect and trade digital tokens representing league players and use them to play fantasy soccer games run by the firm.      Quarterly Slump Chinese bitcoin miner manufacturer Ebang estimates it incurred a net loss of $2.5 million on a revenue of $6.4 million for Q1 2020. In an SEC filing ahead of the company’s proposed public listing, Ebang said revenue grew 6.1% annually, while incurring $5.9 million in cost of revenues, in addition to other operational expenses. Ebang is applying to list on the Nasdaq exchange and anticipates its IPO launch price will be between $4.5 and $6.5 for each of the 19.3 million Class A ordinary shares offered, for a market value of around $800 million.      Grants Crypto exchanges OKCoin and BitMEX recently partnered to provide a $150,000 grant to Bitcoin Core contributor Amiti Uttarwar, an alumna of Coinbase and Xapo, to build out privacy features. Elsewhere, the Ethereum Foundation followed up on its 2019 gift to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) this week with a second cryptocurrency donation. UNICEF said the fund is accepting applications from startups in emerging markets to receive investments via this second donation of roughly 1,125 ether (~$262,000). So far, UNICEF has invested crypto in nine startups in Mexico, India, Turkey, Bangladesh and Cambodia. Finally, Binance has joined an Indian tech industry association to help set best practices in the Indian crypto market.

Bitcoin is trading near $9,450, up nearly 47% this quarter and 145% from the low of $3,867 observed on March 13. Despite the rise, bitcoin’s Mayer multiple – the ratio of the cryptocurrency’s price to its 200-day moving average – currently stands at 1.15, according to MayerMultiple.info. A below-2.4 ratio indicates the cryptocurrency is undervalued.    Opinion    Crypto's Convergence Ajit Tripathi, CoinDesk columnist and an executive director at Binance, said the worlds of crypto, fiat and finance are converging. “A new way of thinking about money, banking and economics has inspired banks and regulators to take a fresh look at whether or how the monetary system is working for society at large. As the pace of digital assets and fiat systems coming together accelerates, I hope a world will emerge where customers have greater financial freedom, wider choice and increased access to capital, payment systems and investments than they have today,” he said.

42432147,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9wBh,1592495326,Crypto Card Issuer Wirecard Says It's Missing $2.1B in 'German Enron' Scandal,"Former German blue-chip Wirecard has said a quarter of its total balance sheet is missing after ""spurious cash balances"" were provided to its auditor, EY.      In an explosive statement Thursday, the Munich-based card issuer, said a total of €1.9 billion ($2.1 billion) could not be accounted for and that some members of the company had purposefully filed false or misleading statements ""in order to deceive the auditor and create a wrong perception of the existence of such cash balances.""      Wirecard admitted the accounting hole was roughly a quarter of the company's total balance sheet.      A former poster child of the German tech scene, Wirecard has been heavily scrutinized over supposed irregularities in its accounting practices. The company was accused last year of fraudulently inflating sales and profit figures, and that it was using client funds held in escrow accounts to boost cash balances.      Wirecard's share price has tanked. At press time, shares traded at the €36 (~$40) mark, down 70% since Wednesday. The credit card issuer had once been one of Germany's most prestigious companies, even surpassing Commerzbank with a €24.6 billion( ~$27.6 billion) market valuation in September 2018.      Lionel Barber, former editor-in-chief of the Financial Times, said on Twitter that Wirecard was turning into a German version of the Enron scandal.      See also: BitPay Launches Prepaid Crypto Mastercard for US Customers      Wirecard subsidiary Wirecard Card Solutions branched out into crypto when it became the issuer for crypto payment card providers Crypto.com and TenX. Wirecard had also partnered with TON Labs, the developer house behind Telegram's blockchain. A court document also claimed Wirecard's COO participated in the $1.7 billion token sale in 2018.      It's unclear if Crypto.com, which only rolled out is payment card in Europe last month, is planning on switching its card issuer. CoinDesk reached out for comment but hadn't heard back by press time.      Wirecard had already delayed the release of its audited financial statements and Thursday was supposed to be the final publication date. Today's news has now pushed this back indefinitely. The delay means creditors will be able to pull up to €2 billion (~$2.2 billion) worth of loans as of Friday.      Wirecard's board is now working ""intensively"" with EY ""towards a clarification of the situation.""",NEGATIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TON | TOKEN SALE,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/18/crypto-card-issuer-wirecard-says-its-missing-21b-in-german-enron-scandal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4bd2f4ed7bb9e6f660ed16ba57f9c1da672fa2a0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432139,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9wDh,1592488034,Tearing Down Monuments Isn't Censorship – It's Speech,"Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.      There was a practice in Ancient Rome called damnatio memoriae. Literally “the condemnation of memory,” this referred to the removal of a person’s name and visage from public records. These purges were an official practice, decreed by the emperor or ratified by the senate. This was a punishment meted out to lowly traitors and to former emperors alike. Statues of the condemned individuals were removed, beheaded or creatively reworked to represent somebody else. Their names were erased, chiseled out of stone inscriptions and ink-blotted over on papyrus scrolls. In paintings, their faces were scrubbed away.      In 2020, we might say they were “cancelled.”      See also: Jill Carlson - What Goldman Gets Wrong About Bitcoin (From Someone Who Used to Work There)      Over the last few weeks, in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests around the world, I have been flooded with images of a modern damnatio memoriae. In Montgomery, Ala., they have at last torn down the Confederate general, Robert E. Lee. In Boston, Christopher Columbus has been decapitated. The protestors in Bristol, U.K., not only tore down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston, they rolled the bronze effigy through the streets and pushed him into the harbor. Just as Roman emperors could find themselves the subject of damnatio memoriae, even the likeness of Winston Churchill – a man who, to many, remains a celebrated war hero and the original anti-fascist – has become the subject of defacement, tagged with graffiti that calls out the man’s imperialist past and points to his role in tragedies such as the Bengal Famine.      Everywhere these statues and protestors meet, there rings an outcry against censorship. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson himself has stood up in defense of the monument to Churchill.      He said:    We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations. They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come    Johnson’s sentiment has been echoed by historians throughout time. The ancient Roman historian Livy said something similar in the opening of his history of Rome:    What chiefly makes the study of history wholesome and profitable is this, that you behold the lessons of every kind of experience set forth as on a conspicuous monument; from these you may choose for yourself and for your own state what to imitate, from these mark for avoidance what is shameful in the conception and shameful in the result.    There are two assumptions upon which both of these statements rely.      The first assumption is that statues, portraits and inscriptions are descriptive rather than normative; that they just show the facts of people, places and things that viewers can interpret for themselves. In other words, there is no value judgment implicitly associated with monuments.      But monuments, by their nature, are normative. They place individuals and their actions on literal pedestals, holding them up as examples to be emulated.      The second assumption is that history is static, that monuments, and the figures and deeds they represent, are relics of the past.      In fact, monuments are and have always been living, breathing artifacts of the evolving present.      See also: ‘We Need 30 Different Words for Censorship,’ Feat. Andreas M. Antonopoulos      Today, many view the act of tearing down statues as an effort to “censor the past,” to borrow Johnson’s words. Reframed, however, the act of defacement or destruction can become a part of each statue’s past. To tear them down is not necessarily, as Johnson would have it, “to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.”      By all means, continue to educate generations to come about these men. Educate generations to come about these statues. And finally, educate generations to come about why some of these statues were defaced or removed. Removing or altering monuments to fit the morals and values of the day is not censorship. It is an act of speech in and of itself.    Rather, the act of scrubbing becomes a part of history.    Amid all the hand-wringing about erasing history, we forget that history is constantly being erased, rewritten and erased again. This is what makes the study of history wholesome and profitable: to recognize that history is continuously reinterpreted and that the evolution of interpretations can tell us as much about ourselves as it does about those who lived tens or hundreds or thousands of years ago. Attempts to scrub a person from a public monument do not need to result in scrubbing that person from history altogether. Rather, the act of scrubbing becomes a part of history. It is worth noting that even 2,000 years later we are very much aware of the Roman practice of damnatio memoriae and continue to study the histories of those against whom it was used.      I am reminded here of a practice stemming from another ancient culture. Kintsugi (“golden joinery”) is the Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics using gold, silver or metallic-colored lacquer. Rather than abandoning the broken piece to the trash or attempting to disguise the breakage, Kintsugi highlights the cracks and incorporates them into the new history of the piece.

42432137,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9w3h,1592487313,The New York Times Proves Why Civil's Vision Is Still Vital,"Cathy Barrera, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an advisory group, and was chief economist at ZipRecruiter. She has a PhD in business economics from Harvard.      The Black Lives Matter protests in response to the police killing of George Floyd have resurfaced the truth of America’s systemic racism. Police brutality, mass incarceration and other acts of violence against black Americans are not new. And, frustratingly, many white Americans have long overlooked the extent of the injustices.      There are many factors that contribute to systemic racism, and there is no single policy or institutional change that will end it, although the Black Lives Matter movement lists local policy changes and demands.      At a macro level, the presence of principled and autonomous news media is an essential component in identifying and combating the embedded bias, discrimination and racism that persists in nearly every institution. And that is why, even though blockchain seems trivial in the midst of the momentous protests of the past two weeks, I was disappointed to read that blockchain news platform Civil is closing its doors.      See also: The Decentralized Web Has Plans, if Not Solutions, for the Misinformation Nightmare      Civil was a blockchain-based, decentralized news platform with a goal of creating “a community-run platform for independent journalism founded to advance trust and sustainability for journalism worldwide.” Civil was decentralized in the sense that any newsroom (existing or newly created) could join the Civil Registry by agreeing to uphold certain journalistic principles.      Advertising wasn’t banned on the platform, but newsrooms were required to be transparent about advertisers. After Civil’s token sale failed in October 2018, it attempted a slow-and-steady approach, re-launching in March 2019 with nearly 100 newsrooms on board. But after losing financial support from members and partnerships, it was forced to shut down in early June 2020, a little over one year after its rebirth.      Despite the struggles Civil encountered, the events that have unfolded at The New York Times over the last week reinforce that the societal need for organizations with Civil’s mission has never been greater.      On June 2, the Timespublished “Send In the Troops,” an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a Republican, in which he argued the U.S. military should be used as part of an “overwhelming show of force to disperse, detain and ultimately deter lawbreakers” during the largely peaceful protests on U.S. soil. Dozens of NYT employees took to social media, breaking official company policy and risking their jobs to speak out against the publication of the op-ed because of the threat to black lives that engagement of the military would pose. After an internal investigation, in which it was revealed the op-ed had not been reviewed by the editor in charge of Opinion, James Bennet, and did not meet fact-checking standards, Bennet resigned.      In this historic and fast-moving news environment, it is alarming the U.S. ""paper of record"" published such an inaccurate op-ed, which bolstered its credibility and amplified its violent call to action. Sadly, the contribution of the news media to violence against black Americans is not new. For decades, the manner of the news coverage of both the violence and the protests has allowed too many Americans to look away, to forget and to block out these truths.    Without a truthful picture we cannot effectively participate in democracy and work to change our institutions for the better.    But this blindness cannot continue. We rely on journalists to provide the information we need to support fact-informed democratic decision-making. The public must receive a raw, honest depiction of what is really happening and how policies and institutions contribute to those events. Without a truthful picture we cannot effectively participate in democracy and work to change our institutions for the better.      The editorial processes that allowed for such a misinformed op-ed to gain credibility exist because of a larger problem in journalism that has been exacerbated in recent years by shrinking budgets. Most outlets are for-profits that earn performance-based revenue through advertising, where article views are the ubiquitous performance metric. Under these conditions, the incentives for the Fourth Estate to effectively facilitate democracy are too weak.      The press must inform all citizens so they are motivated to change policies and institutions and begin the tough yet necessary process of eliminating systemic racism. However, to directly and honestly inform citizens, news outlets must de-emphasize sensational stories. It is common knowledge that, historically, the best strategies to drive clicks focus on extremes.      Sometimes outlets cater to a tight base, spoon-feeding their readers exactly what they want to hear. Other times, outlets thrive on outrage, antagonizing readers with extreme, attention-grabbing headlines and opinions. Rewarding publishers based on clicks is diametrically opposed to honestly informing the public, because clicks are earned through preaching to the choir and/or sensationalized headlines such as “Send in the Troops.”      See also: Media Startup Civil Shuts Down, Team Absorbed Into Decentralized ID Efforts at ConsenSys      While many individual journalists certainly aim to provide this public service, the organizations they work for are fundamentally unable to support this important work under their current structure and business model. A number of public-interest oriented outlets have recognized this fact and are actively working to develop new, innovative structures to overcome this structural obstacle. Nonprofit newsrooms such as ProPublica and Chalkbeat fund their coverage using philanthropic donations (although a portion of Chalkbeat’s revenue is from sponsored ads and job listings).      Civil aimed to take this one step further, leveraging a token-based crowdfunding model along with other innovations to encourage decentralization. While that experiment didn’t pan out, it is imperative others continue the work of iterating on failed aspects of prior business models.      Fixing these incentive problems in journalism will not end systemic racism or police violence. But it is a necessary step toward creating a more just society. The Colorado Sun, one of the most notable Civil newsrooms, is continuing to use a membership-based, part-subscription, part-donation model, alongside CultureBanx, a media company focused on stories in business, finance and tech that are relevant to black culture. We must support and expand these efforts to rebuild a well-functioning Fourth Estate.

42432128,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9vph,1592485208,Ethereum Foundation Makes Second Crypto Donation to UNICEF,"The Ethereum Foundation followed up on its 2019 gift to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) this week with a second cryptocurrency donation.      UNICEF crypto portfolio manager Cecilia Chapiro said the fund is now accepting applications from startups in emerging markets to receive investments via this second donation of roughly 1,125 ether (ETH), or $262,000 at press time.      “We are still looking for big donors … also from a technical expertise perspective, we’re always matching our startups with mentors in the space,” said UNICEF blockchain lead Christina Lomazzo. “We’ve not received any more bitcoin, beyond what we got from the Ethereum Foundation [in 2019].”      There’s no set number, but Chapiro expects to find five to 10 attractive startups for equity-free investments worth $100,000 each. The fund is in talks with other prospective donors, but so far none that could be named for this article.      Read more: How the Ethereum Foundation Got UNICEF to Embrace Blockchain      “When we are going through a global crisis we decided to make a new round of investments to help mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis,” Chapiro said. “It’s the first time we’re doing a call for applications where we’re doing funding in both USD and crypto.”      According to a press statement, the fund is especially keen to invest in projects that “enable decentralized deal-making, for example through decentralized marketplaces” that “enable people to use, earn, and hold cryptocurrencies,” or “collect, aggregate and validate datasets for blockchain oracles.”      So far, UNICEF has invested crypto in nine startups in nations including Mexico, India, Turkey, Argentina and Chile. Investments in Bangladesh's W3 Engineers and Cambodia's Somleng to date have only been in USD, UNICEF said. Many of the projects from this first round, which may receive a second investment, focused on communication networks.      For example, the 10-person startup StaTwig in India, founded in 2016, received a government contract to develop a blockchain-based app for tracking rice deliveries in low-income areas.      “We’re creating the supply chain layer as a base layer, one of the requirements from the government is that we use Ethereum,” said StaTwig co-founder Sid Chakravarthy. “The program benefits 128 million people. … There are close to 2,000 retail shops that get rice from these meal houses.”      Read more: UNICEF Launches Cryptocurrency Fund to Back Open Source Technology      He estimated 250,000 people benefitted from or relied on this application, even if indirectly. He said receiving the investment from UNICEF was the startup’s first time using cryptocurrency. It has received ether and now plans to run an Ethereum node.      “We’re also looking at vaccine supply chains,” Chakravarthy said. “This program didn’t start just because of the virus, in developing countries you have subsidized food programs.”      Because of the pandemic, poverty is an even bigger problem because many people are out of work. Nonprofit organizations and governments around the world are exploring a variety of blockchain solutions during the pandemic.    Meet the entrepreneurs    Rakib Islam is another such recipient, founder of W3 Engineers in Bangladesh since 2009. There are now roughly a dozen employees, out of a total of 100, working on a blockchain project for peer-to-peer messages that include coronavirus emergency updates.      “We want to help the communities in emerging markets handle COVID-19 more effectively,” Islam said. “[Apple and Google] contact tracing isn’t very useful if the community doesn’t have connectivity.”      W3 Engineers also received an investment from Ethereum Classic Labs, $150,000 in fiat, so the team uses both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic blockchain solutions to develop its messaging app. This app was built for people who don’t have access to SIM cards or decent WiFi. Instead, Islam said, the Android mobile app relies on mesh networks and points tallied via an ERC-20 token.      See also: Bootstrapping Mobile Mesh Networks With Bitcoin Lightning      “The refugees don’t have any tender, any currency, and they don’t have any way to make money because they must stay within the camp. … We thought we should offer a type of point system,” Islam said, describing how the messaging app was developed with feedback from some of the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. “Every user, we’re using them to be a node and the role of the phone is to transfer data through them, even if I don’t have an internet connection I can be transferring the information and making a large mesh network.”      Meanwhile, in Cambodia, UNICEF crypto recipient David Wilkie is working on a like-minded communications startup called Somleng. Wilkie described the project as “an open-source cloud communications platform which is currently being used in Africa and Southeast Asia to deliver voice messages to communities affected by COVID-19.”      He added the startup doesn’t plan to run an Ethereum node and doesn’t have a plan yet for how to use cryptocurrency. The funding, however, will enable further development throughout 2020.      As such, UNICEF’s Chapiro emphasized the fund seeks to invest both fiat and crypto in selected startups.      “Each company will receive up to $100,000 in USD and on top of that they will receive bitcoin or ether,” she said.

In a terse exchange about imposing sanctions and tariffs with China, Trump reportedly told Mnuchin: ""Don't be a trade negotiator,"" ordering him instead to: ""Go after bitcoin [for fraud].""      ""If you don't want me on trade, fine, your economic team will execute whatever you want,"" Mnuchin retorted. The exchange comes from an excerpt from Bolton's new book, obtained by the Washington Examiner.      The conversation is said to have happened in May 2018, around the time investors were cheering bitcoin on after it rose 33% against the dollar. It's unclear from the excerpt what specifically led Trump to order Mnuchin to crack down on bitcoin and whether the two men had been talking about cryptocurrencies beforehand.      At the time, there had also been a lot of speculation about what U.S. regulators were going to do about crypto. At CoinDesk's Consensus event that year, industry figures were calling for greater clarity from regulators.

Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      But the action in markets last week might have provided glimpse of how things would play out in the event that the contagion came back – or even if doubts emerged about the prospects for an economic recovery.      Stocks and bitcoin tumbled last week amid concerns the number of cases is rising and as the Federal Reserve warned a full economic recovery isn't likely for at least three years.      Markets recovered quickly, partly due to an announcement of fresh stimulus from the Federal Reserve. But cryptocurrency analysts say the episode shows bitcoin might tumble anew if traditional markets swoon again.      “Should a second wave hit this year, bitcoin will likely continue moving in correlation with the overall market,” Jonathan Leong, CEO of BTSE exchange, said in comments to First Mover.      Cases are rising around the globe as the coronavirus spreads through the herd of humanity.      After more than 50 days without a reported case, health authorities in Beijing reported 36 new cases on Saturday, believed to have been carried in on imported salmon sold at a local market. City officials shut down surrounding neighborhoods, and major supermarkets pulled salmon from shelves.      Daily records of new cases have also cropped up some U.S. states that have started reopening, including Florida, Texas and Arizona.      In France, where President Emmanuel Macron declared a “first victory” against the illness and reopened cafes and restaurants, he has warned the pandemic could easily return.      The risk has spurred some cryptocurrency analysts to start asking how bitcoin might perform if conditions took a turn for the worse.  The memories are still fresh of the sell-off on March 12, now known as “Black Thursday,” when the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks tumbled almost 10%, and bitcoin fell 39%.      Rapid pledges of trillions of dollars of liquidity injections by central banks helped to put a floor under markets. By mid-May, central banks and governments had injected roughly $15 trillion into the global economy. Both bitcoin and U.S. stocks recovered.      Over the past week, the pattern returned. From last Thursday through Monday, the S&P 500 fell by nearly 7% and bitcoin tumbled, too.      The markets rebounded after the Federal Reserve announced Monday it would start buying individual corporate bonds as part of an expanded program that might eventually reach $750 billion of total assets. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) also announced it was ready to pump an additional trillion dollars' worth of yen into local companies.      “The latest demonstration of seemingly unlimited central bank support drowned out the worrying news,"" Michael Mackenzie wrote in his Market Forces newsletter for the Financial Times.      For the past several months, bitcoin and U.S. stocks have shown a weak but persistent correlation.      Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantitative Economics, wrote Tuesday in an email to subscribers that the question of whether bitcoin will crash with stocks ""keeps coming up lately.""      ""The clearer it gets that we may be in for further pain in the stock markets, the more people want to know if bitcoin will again participate in a multi-asset sell-off,"" he wrote.      Investors are likely to be ""a lot more prepared"" for a second crash, he said, and there's a possibility that a ""bout of extreme volatility could break the correlation"" between bitcoin and stocks.      ""Of course, it's only a theory,"" Greenspan said.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,434 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,557 | 24-Hr Low: $9,240      Trend: Bitcoin continues to defend key support and may challenge the $10,000 market in the short term.      The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $9,440, having defended the ascending (bullish) 50-day moving average (MA) support at $9,375 early on Thursday.      Sellers have repeatedly failed to establish a strong foothold below the 50-day SMA in the last week. So far bitcoin has not been able to capitalize on the dip demand, or seller exhaustion, seen below the average support.      The range play, however, could soon end with a breakout on the higher side, according to bullish developments on the three-day chart.      To start with, the 50- and 100-candle MAs have produced a bull cross for the first time June 2016. Back then, the confirmation of the bullish crossover had accelerated the preceding uptrend. Similarly, bitcoin broke into a bull market in the October 2015 following a bull cross of the same two averages.      In addition, the cryptocurrency created a classic long-tailed bullish hammer candle in the three-days to June 17, marking a strong dip demand near support at $8,876. That level marks the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $3,867 to $10,429.      With the three-day chart reporting bullish patterns, technical traders may enter the market, lifting prices higher. The immediate resistance is seen at $9,566, followed by $10,000. On the downside, the Fibonacci support at $8,876 is the level to beat for the sellers.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Paddy Baker, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/18/first-mover-as-us-stocks-defy-economic-gravity-bitcoiners-shudder-at-march-memory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f42db5234c618faa37d4ceefacee3fd77f0c2f8-1500x1035.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432132,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9vzh,1592481603,Polkadot Is Latest Blockchain to Explore Redeemable Bitcoin Tokens,"The latest blockchain to announce a token redeemable for bitcoin (BTC) is Polkadot.      It's only a proof-of-concept at this point and Polkadot is running but not usable yet, but a company called Interlay has designed a model under a Web3 Foundation grant for locking BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain and minting what it's calling PolkaBTC on Polkadot.      If Polkadot does prove to be a meeting place for different blockchains, then the interoperability project will have to touch the original crypto asset, and that's bitcoin.      ""Bitcoin is the asset with the most liquidity and hence we believe there is a natural demand for BTC on platforms that offer DeFi products and other features that are not natively supported in Bitcoin,"" Alexei Zamyatin, CEO of Interlay, told CoinDesk in an email. Interlay works to make decentralized finance (DeFi) products interoperable.      The model deployed has similarities to the model Keep used in launching its tBTC system. A smart contract on Polkadot controls a key to a wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain and verifies its contents using simplified payment verification (SPV). That wallet is collateralized with Polkadot’s native token, DOT, which the initial design sets at 200%, though this could change. Once it verifies that the BTC is present in the wallet it controls, it issues PolkaBTC equivalent to the amount deposited.      Read more: Makers of Keep Protocol Raise $7.7M to Bring Trustless BTC to DeFi      It's important to note here the proof-of-concept describes how it would be done, not who would do it. Different entities would be able to set up vaults to issue PolkaBTC, earning income as the tokens are issued and redeemed.      This also makes it a marked contrast from, for example, wBTC on Ethereum, which is entirely under the centralized control of BitGo, as the sole custodian and issuer.    Motivation    Once a PolkaBTC is created, that new token can be used throughout the Polkadot network and any holder of PolkaBTC can redeem it for actual BTC at any time. The BTC locked on Polkadot is monitored by the BTC-Relay announced by Interlay in April.      A key difference between BTC on Polkadot and on Ethereum is that Polkadot is building it ahead of the use cases. There are no DeFi products as yet ready to enlist PolkaBTC for uses such as lending or collateral.      ""While Etheruem is without question the market leader, there are quite a few projects on Polkadot that are preparing to offer DeFi products,"" Zamyatin noted. He listed Katal, which will enable selling future cash flows, and Acala, a stablecoin platform that could use PolkaBTC as a form of collateral.      Interlay is itself going to create a derivatives platform on which PolkaBTC could be useful.      That said, using wBTC as the main example of the original cryptocurrency on another chain, without a real use case the market showed relatively little interest in bridging the two chains.      Looking at BitGo's record of supply verifications, the wBTC supply hovered between 100 and 600 before wBTC was accepted as a form of collateral on MakerDAO on May 3, 2020. Since then, it has consistently been over 1,000, with a current supply of 4,095 wBTC.      If the Interlay model proves to work well, it can be extended beyond Polkadot.      ""Both the design and code underlying the BTC-Parachain can be reused to bridge other blockchains such as Zcash with only minor modifications,"" Zamyatin said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOT | ETH | MARKET,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/18/polkadot-is-latest-blockchain-to-explore-redeemable-bitcoin-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca9c40e43131df5ea32bd2c99c29b4847f60fabc-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432141,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9wHh,1592479790,"Bitcoin Still Undervalued After Q2 Rally, Price Metric Shows","Bitcoin remains a bargain despite having carved out solid gains in the second quarter, according to one price metric.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading near $9,450 – up nearly 47% so far this quarter and has gained 145% from the low of $3,867 observed on March 13, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price.      Despite the recent rise, bitcoin’s Mayer multiple – the ratio of the cryptocurrency’s price to its 200-day moving average – currently stands at 1.15, according to MayerMultiple.info.      A below-2.4 ratio indicates the cryptocurrency is undervalued. Once the ratio rises above that level, it indicates that bitcoin may be overbought and a speculative bull frenzy has set in. That often leads to a price bubble and a subsequent crash.      For instance, the ratio rose above 2.4 on Dec. 1, 2017, following which bitcoin doubled in value to $20,000 in just two weeks only to fall back to $12,000 on Dec. 22. Similarly, an above-2.4 ratio marked market tops in April 2013 and December 2013.      So, with the ratio currently down more than 50% from the key 2.4 level, the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side – more so, as bitcoin's Mayer multiple is still below its lifetime average of 1.44.      The ratio has been higher than the current level of 1.15 nearly 52% of the time, as noted by Mayer Multiple’s twitter handle. “This is a good time to stack sats,” tweeted Ecoinometrics, a bitcoin analysis company, referring to satoshis, small divisions of a bitcoin.      Simulations performed by Mayer Multiple’s founder Trace Mayer show that in the past an investor would have achieved better results by accumulating bitcoin when the ratio was below 2.4.      That said, the Mayer multiple is a technical analysis tool and its accuracy in predicting undervalued/overvalued conditions is not guaranteed.      See also: First Mover: As US Stocks Defy Economic Gravity, Bitcoiners Shudder at March Memory      And expecting past performance to hold consistent for future performance is risky as market conditions change. For instance, bitcoin’s correlation with the equity markets has strengthened this year and the cryptocurrency may suffer sharp losses if stocks crash on renewed coronavirus fears.      However, on-chain activity is supportive of the bullish picture painted by the Mayer multiple. The number of bitcoin whales or entities holding more than 1,000 coins recently rose to 1,844, the highest level since November 2017, as noted on Wednesday.      Retail interest, too, is at record highs, as tweeted by Ciara Sun, head of global business and markets and vice president at cryptocurrency exchange Huobi.      The continued accumulation of bitcoin by both retail and large investors indicates confidence in the long-term bullish narrative surrounding bitcoin. Whether that confidence is justified, only time will tell.

The financial disclosure was posted Wednesday in an update to the firm's initial public offering (IPO) prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing means Ebang is now a step closer to becoming the latest publicly traded bitcoin miner manufacturer in the U.S.      In the amended F-1 form, Ebang said it has now applied to list on the Nasdaq exchange and anticipates its IPO launch price will be between $4.5 and $6.5 for each of the 19.3 million Class A ordinary shares to be offered in total.      With that range, Ebang would command a market value of around $800 million and is targeting a raise from $86 million to $125 million – generally in line with the company's initial plan published in April.      Read more: Why Miner Maker Ebang’s US IPO Raises More Questions Than Answers      If successful, the Hangzhou, China-based company will become the second bitcoin miner maker traded in the U.S. after Canaan, which made its Nasdaq debut last November and raised $90 million with an offering of $9 per per share. But since then, Canaan's stock has been on a downward trend and recently hit a record low below $2.      Also disclosed in the updated prospectus are Ebang's ""estimated preliminary unaudited"" financial results for Q1 2020. The firm said it made $6.4 million in revenue with 6.1% growth year-on-year – primarily due to a better bitcoin mining outlook in the first three months in 2020 compared to the same period last year.      Yet, the firm said it recorded $5.9 million in cost of revenue, in addition to other operational expenses, which in total led to a net loss of $2.5 million for the first three months of the year.      Read more: Bitmain’s Power Struggle Takes Toll on Customers as Co-Founder Halts Shipments      For the same period, Canaan, which has a bigger bitcoin miner market share than Ebang, reported a net loss of $5 million even though it had cut the price of its mining hardware by more than half around bitcoin’s halving event and the COVID-19 pandemic that has disrupted global supply chains.    Growing tensions    Ebang's IPO update also comes amid rising geopolitical tension between China and the U.S., which is casting a shroud of uncertainty over Chinese companies that are already listed or seeking to list in the U.S.      In Ebang's initial prospectus in April, the firm said its independent auditor was not fully inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a U.S. non-profit auditing watchdog, as it requires ""the approval of the Chinese authorities.""      ""This lack of PCAOB inspections in [China] prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our independent registered public accounting firm’s audits and its quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections,"" Ebang said.      At the time, there was heightened regulatory interest in placing tougher rules on foreign companies listed in the U.S. with regard to granting PCAOB approvals and providing U.S. regulators routine access to the audit reports of Chinese firms.      But discussions around the issue have become more serious over the last month, with the U.S. senate unanimously passing a bill that would require the SEC to ban the trading of any company whose auditors haven't been inspected for three years by the PCAOB, according to a May 20 report from The Wall Street Journal.

However, the issue has attracted attention again following the scandal of U.S.-listed Chinese Starbucks coffee rival Luckin, which reported in April that much of its $310 million 2019 sales numbers were fabricated by its senior executives.

Uttarwar is an alumna of Coinbase, the bitcoin custody startup Xapo and the Chaincode Labs residency. Over the past two years, she’s quickly become one of the industry’s most sought-after developers. According to Chaincode residency organizer Adam Jonas, Uttarwar’s work is focused on improving the privacy of bitcoin transactions.      “She is redesigning transaction rebroadcasts to prevent spy nodes from being able to map IP addresses to transaction broadcasts,” Jonas said, describing Uttarwar’s work involving internet protocols.      Read more: Where to Find Bitcoin’s Rising Stars      Bitcoin Core contributor Gleb Naumenko, who also received a grant from BitMEX, estimated Uttarwar is now one of roughly 21 full-time Bitcoin Core developers with funding, out of 57 full-time developers, focused on open-source bitcoin projects at companies such as Lightning Labs and Blockstream.      “Only the most responsible users understand the importance of ‘roads’ and support their development,” Naumenko said, describing public goods Bitcoin funding. “I see many benefits in responsibility-based, non-forcible dev funding. It turned out that by 2020 we have several responsible ecosystem members like that.”      The 2020 grant for Uttarwar, worth roughly $150,000, will allow her to continue working on privacy tech related to bitcoin.      “Backing independent developers continues to be a priority for us as we seek to contribute to the long-term success and proliferation of the Bitcoin network,” OKCoin CEO Hong Fang said in a statement.

Bitfinex’s parent firm, iFinex Inc., is seeking to trace $850 million in user funds seized by authorities in four different countries after bank accounts held by its payment processor, Crypto Capital, were frozen in August 2018.      iFinex applied for subpoenas in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia in April, but the U.S. District Court of Georgia recently denied its request due to filing errors.      A federal judge did grant iFinex’s application in Arizona in April and the third subpoena filing in Colorado, for a different bank, was granted last month.      According to the court ruling filed June 8 in Georgia, Magistrate Judge Alan J. Baverman said the bank iFinex is trying to subpoena merged with another financial institution and is now based in North Carolina. As such, the Georgia court does not hold jurisdiction over the exchange’s petition.      Moreover, for reasons unknown, iFinex named Citibank in its petition rather than the intended SunTrust Bank, which merged with Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) to form Truist Bank in December 2019.      ""[It] appears that Applicant ... has filed its petition in the wrong district. Even if Applicant had shown that SunTrust Bank still exists and is headquartered or otherwise 'resides' or 'is found' in this district, the petition would still be due to be denied as the proposed subpoena is addressed not to SunTrust Bank (or Truist Bank) but instead to Citibank,” Judge Baverman wrote.      The missing funds were first made public by the New York Attorney General’s office which alleged that Bitfinex lost the $850 million and later used a secret loan from affiliated stablecoin issuer Tether to secretly cover the shortfall.      See also:New York Attorney General Calls Bitfinex’s Legal Stance ‘Deeply Perverse’ in New Filing      In addition to filing its petition in the wrong district and naming the wrong bank, iFinex also failed to present relevant supporting evidence to the court. Lastly, the judge concluded that a lack of clarity on the time frame of the subpoena meant it was “unduly intrusive and burdensome.""      The various state subpoena applications follow an initial subpoena request in October 2019, filed in California, where the exchange sought testimony from a former TCA Bancorp executive about Crypto Capital’s accounts. This subpoena was later granted.

The nation's Ministry of Justice opposed the draft new regulation Tuesday, a week after the Ministry of Economic Development also criticized it. The bill was introduced by lawmakers in March but is broadly believed to be the brainchild of the country’s central bank, which has a prohibitive approach to crypto. The proposal met some harsh reviews from Russia’s crypto community after being unveiled.      According to Russian newspaper Izvestia, Deputy Minister of Justice Denis Novak prepared the ministry’s comment for the draft bill, criticizing the proposal’s inconsistency.      The ministry's press office confirmed to CoinDesk he wrote the response, adding his feedback was sent to the Digital Economy think tank, which is working with the government on policy issues.      See also: Russia’s Supreme Court Makes ‘Landmark’ Vote With Blockchain System From Kaspersky Lab      The bill sets out that Russians should not be able to use the nation's infrastructure to conduct any operations with cryptocurrency, but individuals are allowed to inherit coins or accept them as the result of a counterparty's bankruptcy process.      Crypto can also be seized like any other type of property with a court warrant.      The justice ministry pointed out, though, it’s not clear what courts would be able to do with confiscated crypto. Normally, marshals would sell seized property at auctions, but if all crypto transactions are illegal in Russia this wouldn't be possible.      Instead, the ministry suggests choosing a government body that will be allowed to help Russians sell crypto abroad.      In the meantime, the draft bill’s sponsor, lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov, told the news agency TASS the part of the bill regarding digital securities is ready to be passed and will go through a final hearing soon.

42432108,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9rJh,1592438400,South Korean Soccer League Tokenizes Players for Fantasy Football Game,"Fans of South Korean professional soccer will now be able to collect and trade digital tokens representing league players and use them to play fantasy soccer games run by the firm Sorare.      The South Korean soccer association K League announced a licensing agreement with the blockchain enabled fantasy soccer platform on Wednesday. The agreement gives Sorare the right to include over 400 players from the league’s upper division onto its platform, which currently includes players from prominent teams including Juventus, Atletico Madrid and Napoli, according to a press release.      Based in Paris, France, Sorare uses the Ethereum blockchain to generate unique digital cards representing players, which can be traded by users. Upon joining, a user is given a random set of five cards they can use to build a team and participate in weekly league competitions. Users have the option of buying tokens representing other players to improve their team and – depending on how the soccer players perform in real life – may receive rewards in ether or more trading cards.      According to Sorare CEO Nicolas Julia, the firm’s fantasy soccer platform currently has about 3,000 monthly active users that can choose to play with players from over 100 different soccer clubs. He also said the company generated about $200,000 in sales last month.      “Collecting and engaging with your favorite football (soccer) players is part of the initiative to attract more people into following the K League,” said K League, in the press release.      Although betting on online sports is illegal in South Korea, Sorare said the firm’s fantasy soccer is not betting because there is no financial sacrifice users have to make.      “Sorare is more like a mixture between trading cards and fantasy football,” Julia said. He added that users may choose to buy cards to improve their team, but they can play for free and a bad performance from the player would not mean that they lose money.      Sorare said using the Ethereum blockchain ensures the authenticity and scarcity of digital player tokens. The scarcity is what makes the tokens valuable and likely to appreciate in value if a player performs well. One of the digital tokens issued for soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo is currently valued at over €14,000 (US$15,700) on Sorare’s website.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | TRADING,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/18/south-korean-soccer-league-tokenizes-players-for-fantasy-football-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29eaca03561d86858d51aba98100e001363d5b79-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
