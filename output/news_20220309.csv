42395863,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzbig,1646869836,First Mover Asia: Signs Point Upward for Crypto in India and South Korea; Bitcoin and Ether Soar on US Executive Order,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos spiked following U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order.  Insights: The signs for crypto in India, South Korea and other parts of the world pointed upward on Wednesday  Technician's take: BTC appears to be overbought on intraday charts.

And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,020 +3.2%  Ether (ETH): $2,729 +1.6%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Stellar XLM +9.3% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin Cash BCH +8.5% Currency Bitcoin BTC +8.4% Currency  Top Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Prices Rise After Executive Order  After near five days of bad news and sagging prices, crypto hit a gusher on Wednesday.  For once the drumbeat of horror stories from Ukraine, ongoing angst about inflation and energy supplies, and uncertainty about crypto regulation evaporated with the release of U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order on cryptocurrency. The document provided few specifics but allayed many investors' fears the administration would adopt a ham-fisted approach, hindering innovation and discouraging consumers and financial institutions from diving deeper into the market. Those groups, particularly the institutions, fueled the massive increase in bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos last year.  Instead, the order acknowledged crypto's importance and instructed agencies responsible for regulation to coordinate their efforts. Investors saw this approach as a positive.  ""The market hates uncertainty,"" John Sarson, CEO and founder of Sarson Funds, a provider of blockchain and crypto investment products and services, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. He added: ""We've been saying for some time this executive order would be a springboard for a rally in the crypto market, and that's exactly what we're seeing.  Recently, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at around $42,000, up about 3% over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at about $2,700, a roughly 1.5% gain over the same period. Both bitcoin were up even higher earlier on Wednesday All other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap were in the green, most of them significantly.  In a CoinDesk op-ed Kristin Smith, the executive director of the Blockchain Association, the powerhouse, Washington, D.C., trade group, called the Biden order ""a major milestone for the industry in the United States.""  ""If you are bullish on the long-term possibilities for cryptocurrencies to transform many of the foundational services of our lives, then this recognition by the federal government of crypto's fundamental importance can only be viewed as an affirmation of that position,"" Smith wrote.  Wednesday's price increases dovetailed with the performance of equity markets that have been battered lately as Russia escalated its unprovoked attack on Ukraine and the U.S. and other countries that condemned the invasion responded with severe sanctions. Sarson noted bitcoin is now functioning both as ""a safe haven and risk-on asset, which is where we can really start to see new all-time highs made for the asset category.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,277 +2.5%  DJIA: 33,286 +2%  Nasdaq: 13,255 +3.5%  Gold: -2.8%  Insights  Crypto Regulatory Signs Also Point Upward in India and South Korea  Wednesday was a good day for crypto in parts of Asia, as well as the U.S. and Dubai.  Prices soared on the Biden Administration's release of a crypto executive order that recognized the importance of crypto and mapped some reasonable next steps for regulating the rapidly growing industry. U.S. investors and beyond expecting a more stringent approach were relieved.  But the news was far from the only boost on the regulatory and political front for cryptos. South Korea elected a new president in an election that was marked partly by the two main candidates' efforts to woo younger voters by promising crypto friendly policies. India's finance minister said that the nation's central bank would launch a central bank digital currency sooner than previously indicated. In the Middle East, where a number of countries have accelerated their efforts to cultivate blockchain projects, Dubai's ruler tweeted about the adoption of a crypto law.  South Korea  In a close election, South Korea picked the conservative People Power Party candidate Yoon Seok-youl as president. In an effort to connect with younger, tech-savvy voters, both Yoon and his opponent, Lee Jae-myung of the governing Democratic Party promised to promote crypto friendly policies during their campaigns.  Yoon pledged to raise the threshold for a crypto capital gains tax to be the same as equities, taking it from the current 20% tax which kicks in at KRW 2.5 million (US$2,024) to KRW 52.4 million ($42,450). He also promised something similar to Lee, which was to ""take legal measures to confiscate crypto profits gained through illegitimate means and return them to the victims.”  Lee said he would use security token offerings as a way to issue tokenized securities to return ill-earned profits from real estate speculation to the people, to establish a monitoring agency and to bring back initial coin offerings (ICO), which the nation banned in 2017.  India  India Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that she expected the nation's central bank to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or digital rupee “this year,” veering from her earlier statement that it would launch some time between 2022 and 2023. The announcement ratcheted up the competition with China in which will be the first country to make a CBDC a staple of their monetary system. China, the world’s most populated nation, is increasingly embracing blockchain and the metaverse, even recently holding a metaverse job fair.  Dubai  Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai's ruler, addressed uncertainty and concerns in his country about crypto when he tweeted about the adoption of a crypto law and the establishment of an independent authority for oversight.  Al Maktoum said that Dubai hopes to create the “best business environment in the world for virtual assets” and coincides with its hosting Dubai Blockchain Week and several crypto or metaverse related events throughout the month.  Shanghai  According to the South China Morning Post, the state-backed Shanghai Data Exchange has launched what it describes as a metaverse-based recruitment program in which job seekers “enter the metaverse and adopt the avatar of an animated man in a black suit and then meet recruiters who represent nine departments. Controversially, job seekers cannot interact with human recruiters while in the metaverse and the gender of the avatar, a man, cannot be changed.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Enters Resistance Zone Between $40K-$45K  Bitcoin (BTC) rallied as much as 10% over the past 24 hours as buyers reacted to short-term oversold readings.  Resistance, or the pointwhere an uptrend is expected to pause temporarily due to a concentration of supply, at around the $40,000-$45,000 price zone could stall the current upswing, similar to what occurred last week.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is oversold, which typically precedes a brief pullback in price. On the daily chart, however, the RSI is neutral, suggesting that lower support around $37,000-$40,000 could stabilize pullbacks into the Asia trading day.  For now, bitcoin remains in a tight trading range, although downside momentum has slowed over the past two months. That means bulls could remain active at short-term support levels.  BTC was recently trading near $42,000 at press time and is down 3% over the past week.

Cryptocurrencies are also trading in the red as a result of the Russian-Ukraine military crisis. However, much of the fascination with these unregulated currencies stems from the desire to trade for profit, with speculators sending prices high at times. For many young investors, cryptocurrency has proven to be the best asset to invest in. There are numerous use cases where cryptocurrencies are frequently used, ranging from commercial giants to startups. Cryptocurrencies with high investment rates, trading volumes, and liquidity are typically picked for long-term investment. March is likely to be another tough month for the cryptocurrency industry, especially if authorities continue to press for more crypto regulation. This has been on the cards for a while, but it might come sooner if states suspect Russia of exploiting crypto to avoid sanctions. Apart from this, Ukraine has also been getting huge donations in terms of Bitcoin. As a result, now is a smart moment to stick to more well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. And if the largest cryptocurrency is picking up the bull run, then Altcoins is most likely to follow suit as it has always done.

Miners who participate in mempools help to confirm transactions for which they receive a reward once a transaction is cleared. Usually, the mempool is &apos;free&apos; and transactions go through easily with low fees but there are times when the mempool fills up causing transactions fees to surge. This was what took place at the start of March. Bitcoin Transaction Fees Surge At the beginning of the month, bitcoin had experienced higher transaction fees. These higher fees were as a result of transaction clustering in the mempool. Once the mempool has filled to a point where there were too many transactions to confirm, fees had invariably gone up given that transactions are confirmed based on the fee they carry. So transactions with higher fees had been confirmed first. Related Reading | Why Is Bitcoin So Volatile, Anyway? Fidelity Digital Assets Explains In order to compete in this pool that had filled up, incoming transactions had to carry a higher transaction fee per vByte (virtual byte) which is the size of the transaction.

42395862,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzbhh,1646864574,"Inflation, Tracked by Bitcoiners, Keeps Accelerating, and It Hasn't Even Peaked","U.S. inflation probably accelerated last month to a new four-decade high, showing the intensity of upward pressures on consumer prices even before Russia's war on Ukraine sent commodity prices from oil to wheat soaring, according to a Bloomberg report.  The consumer price index (CPI), due out from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, is expected to show that the inflation rate was 0.8% in February, or 8% over the past 12 months. That would be the highest level since 1982, and faster than the 0.6% monthly clip reported for January.  Bitcoin (BTC) traders are likely to monitor the index, since the largest cryptocurrency is seen by some investors as a hedge against inflation. There's also a view that bitcoin's price sometimes reacts to Federal Reserve decisions on monetary policy, and a key mandate for the U.S. central bank is to assure price stability.  Many analysts are still bullish on bitcoin, but the cryptocurrency isn’t performing as the hedge against inflation that they expected. Bitcoin is down 8% since the start of 2022 after reaching its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021.  “Bitcoin and crypto in general will remain tied to the news out of Ukraine and continue to trade broadly in a risk off/on fashion,” said Richard Usher, head of other-the-counter trading at BCB Group. “We feel that the CPI report on Thursday will prove to be a side event to the Russia/Ukraine situation.”  Gas prices and the Fed  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he supported a 0.25 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates, which would be the first hike since 2018. The Fed has become more dovish in recent weeks as the Russia-Ukraine conflict drags on and adds concern about global oil supplies and price pressures.  Bitcoin has underperformed gold in 2022, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent many investors in traditional markets searching for the yellow metal long seen as a ""safe haven"" asset.  The cryptocurrency was changing hands at $41,900 at press time, down 8.9% on the year.  Richard F. Moody, senior vice president and chief economist at Regions Financial, wrote in a report that he expects inflation will continue to rise in coming months.  “We and most others had thought we’d see inflation peak with either the February or March data,” Moody said.  With oil prices clearing $120 per barrel due to the cutoff of Russian supplies, Moody expects “further pass-through to retail gasoline prices in the weeks ahead.”  The national average price at the pump for regular unleaded gasoline has soared to a record $4.252 per gallon, according to AAA, the motorist association. That's up from $2.796 a year ago.  Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy metrics, are expected to have risen 0.5% in February, according to Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. Porter said he’s watching to see if inflation is seeping into other categories like services which aren’t driven by supply chain constraints.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Brian Evans,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/09/inflation-tracked-by-bitcoiners-keeps-accelerating-and-it-hasnt-even-peaked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/470806b426e0644423c9857f70f7d22173407fe9-4860x3634.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The types of supported tokens, staking periods, and staking methods vary depending on who you stake with. Nowadays, liquid staking is becoming more popular. What Is Liquid Staking? If you&apos;ve staked before, you may have been required to keep your staked crypto assets locked up for some time. This is why the widely used Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism works so effectively over hundreds of blockchains. It vastly improves the Proof of Work technique as it is very energy efficient and provides rewards quickly. If your cryptocurrency is frozen in the staking process, you won&apos;t be able to transfer, sell, or use it until the staking period has ended. The unlocking time of staked tokens varies based on the token and platform you&apos;re using, but they might range from days to weeks and even months. This isn&apos;t a significant issue in staking, but it does deter some users because they won&apos;t be able to touch their tokens for an extended period. Furthermore, you may be charged a penalty if you un-stake before the end of the staking period. Un-staking typically takes weeks, so you&apos;ll have to wait a long time for your funds to become available. This is where liquid staking becomes a viable opti...",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-liquid-staking/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42395852,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzbao,1646862645,Conservative Candidate Yoon Suk-Yeol Wins South Korea’s Presidential Election,"Conservative Party candidate Yoon Suk-Yeol, a former top prosecutor who promised to deregulate the crypto industry, will become South Korea’s next president.  The election was one of the closest in South Korean history. Yoon beat his opponent, Lee Jae-myung of the ruling Liberal Party, by less than one percentage point on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.  Crypto was one of the hottest topics during the election. Both Yoon and Lee announced crypto-friendly stances in an attempt to win over younger voters.  Increasing levels of household debt and stagnating salaries have pushed many young Koreans to turn to the stock market and crypto investing to get ahead, but the current government under President Moon Jae-In has cracked down on crypto. Strict regulatory changes saw nearly 70 Korean exchanges shut down in 2021, leaving only a handful operating.  Read more: Young, Crypto-Savvy Voters May Hold the Key to South Korea’s Next Election  Across South Korea’s top three exchanges, there are more than five million individual crypto accounts – representing nearly 10% of the country’s population.  Unicorn hunting and reducing crypto taxes  During his campaign, Yoon promised to deregulate the crypto industry. At a crypto conference in January, Yoon said regulations “that are far from reality and unreasonable” must be overhauled in order to “realize the unlimited potential of the virtual asset market.”  Yoon expressed his desire to attract and develop crypto “unicorns” – startup businesses valued at $1 billion or more.  Yoon also pledged to raise the proposed threshold for capital gains taxes to kick in on cryptocurrency profits to KRW 52.4 million (US$42,450). Starting in 2023, a 20% tax is to be levied on crypto gains above KRW 2.5 million ($2,024) earned in under a year.  Yoon has also promised to ""take legal measures to confiscate crypto profits gained through illegitimate means and return them to the victims.”  Some of South Korea’s biggest companies in the entertainment and gaming sector have indicated an interest in crypto, pledging during their annual shareholder meetings to create non-fungible tokens (NFT) or play-to-earn games.  Lee, the runner-up, focused his efforts on courting those gaming companies. He set up a gaming and metaverse task force and promised to make the country a crypto hub. Lee also released his own NFTs and said he would accept campaign donations in crypto.  Meanwhile, there are at least 14 crypto-related bills currently circulating in the South Korean parliament, and the lack of clear regulation has frustrated many in the industry.  “Something has to happen after the presidential election,” Harold Kim, former director of the Korea Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk in February.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/09/conservative-candidate-yoon-suk-yeol-wins-south-koreas-presidential-election,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2fcea22a4023261c7022bad3a430a7667a313ae4-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The three banks are now part of the USDF Consortium, a group that includes founding members New York Community Bank, Synovus Bank, NBH Bank, First Bank and Webster Bank, the organization said in a statement Wednesday. Investment bank Piper Sandler will offer guidance through the process as the consortium grows.  The USDF Consortium was formed in January to tackle concerns over fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies issued by non-bank entities. Stablecoins have swelled into a roughly $180 billion slice of the $1.8 trillion crypto economy, with Tether’s USDT as the top dog.  “The increase in membership is a testament to the consortium’s ability to provide in-depth guidance and connect banks with turn-key technology solutions as well as the transformative role that blockchain payment rails can play in financial services,” Ashley Harris, chairwoman of the USDF Consortium, said in the statement.

42395864,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzbjf,1646860791,Market Wrap: Cryptos Rise After Biden's Executive Order; Sentiment Still Mixed,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded higher on Wednesday after U.S. President Biden issued a long-awaited executive order on crypto, which did not impose new regulations on the industry.  Instead, the executive order directs federal agencies to better communicate about their work in the digital asset sector. It does not lay out specific positions the administration wants agencies to adopt, according to CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De. Still, the order could lead to additional regulation in the future.  ""The order seems relatively benign, hence giving the market some clarity,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""As many investors had prepared for the downside risks of this event by waiting on the sidelines, we are seeing many buy bitcoin back in what appears to be a spot-driven rally.""  ""A year ago, bitcoin holders were afraid of regulation, and now the U.S. government sees the value and long-term prospects for innovation and opportunity,"" Edward Moya, an analyst at Oanda, told CoinDesk. ""Regulation is viewed as a positive for crypto. Large parts of the crypto industry need to get cleaned up and that should happen once crypto companies have regulatory clarity.""  Bitcoin rose as much as 10% following the release of the executive order, and traded above $40,000 over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, ether (ETH) rose about 5% over the past 24 hours. Equities were also higher on Wednesday, while traditional safe havens such as gold and the U.S. dollar declined.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $41,896, +8.60%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,697, +5.39%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,278, +2.57%    ●Gold: $1,997 per troy ounce, −2.09%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.95%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Volatility returns  Implied volatility in the bitcoin options market is starting to rise from extreme lows over the past few days. That could point to greater price swings outside of the $30,000-$40,000 BTC price range, especially ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting on March 15-16.  QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm, noticed increased activity in short-term BTC and ETH volatility markets, with significant demand during the Asia trading day. ""We managed to take some profit on our March 18 long volatility position,"" QCP wrote in a Telegram announcement. Long volatility is a trading strategy that usually involves buying options to profit from a greater than expected rise in realized volatility.  Sentiment has been less bearish among bitcoin option traders, evidenced by the decline in the put/call ratio over the past month. Still, there has been a slight uptick in the ratio in recent days, indicating some caution among traders.  Other indicators show immense bearish sentiment, which means traders are still skeptical despite recent price jumps. For example, ""option buyers are willing to pay higher premiums to hedge their expected price decline risk,"" Deribit, a crypto options and futures exchange, wrote in a blog post.  During times of market stress (such as a war), however, sentiment can fluctuate wildly.  ""The impact of local wars and subsequent series of events on the market has shown significant “shortwave” characteristics: The volatility of options near the expiration date jumps up and down rapidly, while the volatility of options farther away from the expiration date remains relatively stable,"" Deribit wrote.  Altcoin roundup  LUNA surges 25% to new all-time high of $104: Terra’s LUNA token rose to as high as $104.58 on Wednesday morning, topping a previous all-time record of $103.34 notched in December.

Historically, investors see gold as a reliable safe-haven asset they can run to when stocks and bonds decline.

Peterson noted the contrast between the U.S. and China, which last summer banned crypto mining altogether and drove a wave of new investment in North America. “We see this [executive] order as another indicator that the regulatory environment in the U.S. is more supportive of miners and cryptocurrencies,” he added.  Peterson reiterated buy ratings on miners Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Marathon Digital (MARA). Shares of both are higher by about 15% at the same time as a 9% advance for bitcoin (BTC). However, shares of the miners remain lower by more than 30% for the year to date, while bitcoin's price is down about 16%.

42421201,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIjl,1646855153,‘People Will Get Burned’: Matt Odell on the Long Road to Bitcoin Privacy,"Ask a hundred people what Bitcoin is and you are bound to get a hundred different answers. It’s “digital gold.” An uncensorable transaction network. A high-alpha buy tracking tech stocks.  One thing is clear, however. Bitcoin is not an effective tool for money laundering.  The most notable example is perhaps Russia, which – facing never-before-seen sanctions blocking it from most of the dollar-denominated global economy – hasn’t yet been all that interested in using the stateless monetary network, Bitcoin. Not even the U.S. Treasury thinks crypto will be an effective means to skirt international sanctions.  Bitcoin, as it stands, just isn’t very good for the actual day-to-day needs of criminals, be they individuals or nation-states. That’s because there’s no privacy on Bitcoin. And that’s a problem for law-abiding users as well. A fully auditable ledger of transactions, grouped and ordered by computer hashes to also make it immutable, the blockchain is unlike any other financial system. The books are fully open, and they leave a permanent record of crime.  Sure, there is a modicum of privacy on Bitcoin by way of native pseudonymous, alphanumeric addresses. You don’t have to reveal your true name to use Bitcoin. But you do if you want to use Coinbase or most other on-ramps to the fiat economy.  “Privacy is the ability to selectively reveal yourself to the world,” said privacy advocate and full-time bitcoiner Matt Odell, who has written a guide on how to achieve this using bitcoin. The system isn’t perfect, but it can be used pragmatically.  Staying private on Bitcoin requires a lot of work. It requires sourcing your bitcoin anonymously and figuring out how to store it, send it and spend it without divulging any personal information – ever. If at any point you leak identifying information, your whole history of financial transactions and all transactions going forward can be tied back to your identity. You have to start again.  Like other bitcoiners, Odell, the co-host of ""Tales from the Crypt,"" wants to make bitcoin better for anyone in a disadvantaged position – even if that might benefit money launders.  Part of the reason there are so many definitions of or metaphors explaining Bitcoin is that it’s a system that has promise to develop into so much more. It could be the settlement layer for the global economy or even a reserve asset held by central banks. Despite the lack of privacy, Bitcoin’s other features – its supply limit and censorship-resistance – make it appealing. It’s the best money, Odell says. And because it is the best money, all other finance will fly to it.  In a recent interview, Odell talked about CoinJoins, using bitcoin privately and the need for “canaries.”  This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.  So there’s a “canary” at the bottom of your website. What’s the idea behind that?  Usually companies do it. The idea is that the U.S. government has been known to issue warrants and subpoenas with gag orders where you cannot tell your customers that you've got a warrant. But those gag orders don't stop you from removing something from your website. So if you have a warrant canary up already, when you get a subpoena, warrant or a request for information, you remove the canary because it doesn't violate the gag order.  Then you just hope that your audience is paying attention. I am not a company, obviously, but I am an outspoken privacy advocate. So who knows? If there is a situation where I just cannot talk on Twitter the canary text will disappear.  Is this a serious threat?  The stakes are extremely high. Privacy is a very sensitive topic, period. We have had governments push against encrypted communications and censor different privacy-related topics. Financial privacy is even more sensitive because it so quickly morphs into, “Oh, you're enabling terrorists.” That’s a real pigeonhole advocates face – when obviously the goal is accessible financial privacy for the whole world. Criminals are already going to be able to use these tools privately; the question is if the average person is going to, too.  Is there a contradiction between living a public life and advocating for privacy?  Privacy advocates get stuck in a hole because if we do not have people talking about it then we have already lost. But if you care about privacy, you do not really want to talk about it, which is why you see a lot of privacy advocates or “nyms” [short for pseudonym] not showing their faces.  The unfortunate reality in our society is people do not take you as seriously if you are not a public individual. So the way I have circled that square is I put myself out there, but I try my best to elevate and empower nyms so it is more distributed. The other thing is, there is this disconnect between privacy and secrecy. Privacy is the ability to selectively reveal yourself to the world – so people might know my face, they might know some things about me, but they know what I want them to know in a controlled way as much as possible.  If you could do it over again would you use a pseudonym?  First of all, I have a ton of names. Many names. The name is not the issue. The issue is the face. If I did it again, I might not show it. You know, names can be changed, our faces are with us forever.  We live in a world of increasing facial recognition – my face is likely in government databases around the world. And that is not great. But it goes back to the same trade-off, right? I do not think my platform would be as large if I did it any other way.  What does “functional privacy” mean? It’s a term I hear a lot in reference to the open Bitcoin system, where, strictly speaking, privacy is impossible, but pseudonymity can be maintained.  With Bitcoin, you do not explicitly have a name attached to your Bitcoin addresses or when sending transactions. But every transaction does get recorded in this public ledger that we call the blockchain forever, and that is going to outlast all of us if we are correct.  It can be explored by anybody who has an internet connection. One of the dangerous things that can be done – after the fact, you do not need an active adversary – is that someone can find something out about you and then go back on-chain and follow everything you have done. That means if you do not start practicing privacy best practices now, it could have massive effects for you down the line that you're not even considering.  At the same time, we have every regulated company requiring intimate personal information on bitcoin users. They are keeping huge lists on our transaction history, our balances. That information is obviously used to track users, to deanonymize users. We have surveillance, mercenary companies that have popped up that are focused purely on doing that for both corporations and governments, so the privacy situation on Bitcoin right now is not great. Over 95% of users are probably coming in through KYC [“know your customer”] on-ramps if not more.  See also: There's a Bigger Scam Than Anything in Crypto, It's Called KYC  At the same time, the fact that Bitcoin is an open ledger is a key aspect of its value prop[osition]. The whole idea is that you do not have to trust anybody, that you can verify everything yourself. That is enabled because it is easy to use your own node, and the ledger is transparent and verifiable.  Everything has trade-offs. Where's the middle ground?  The middle ground is more user-friendly apps that can give people practical privacy that is accessible on the app level rather than necessarily trying to bake it all into the actual Bitcoin protocol.  We have started to kind of see that over the last few years. We have Wasabi and Samourai wallets. They are about to put out Wasabi 2.0, which hopefully should fix a lot of the issues that we have seen in Wasabi 1, which I do not recommend right now. I recommend Samourai Wallet and JoinMarket.  Privacy is a very achievable goal in Bitcoinland, but the protocol is extremely hard to change – that’s another key aspect of its value prop, because if you could change it then you can change it to the negative. It is important for us to have achievable goals and I think the most achievable goal is more user-friendly apps.  That's fair. But the pointed question to ask would be – putting aside that at least 95% of people are coming on through KYC exchanges and considering that you have to figure out how to store it, how to use it properly, get familiar with mixers, all of these steps that you cannot mess up once – is privacy on Bitcoin a dead end even with apps?  I get where you're going with this.  First of all, it's important to make a distinction between mixers and CoinJoin. Mixers to me are centralized custodial services where you send someone bitcoin and they send you new bitcoin. CoinJoin is a collaborative transaction: when you have multiple people sending a transaction together to help break the probability-analysis that chain-surveillance companies do. As a result, it's a native bitcoin send transaction.  So obviously there's been a long history of custodial mixers being deemed illegal specifically by the U.S. government (and others). There's been no such cases with CoinJoin, but I am not necessarily the most optimistic person in terms of what our legal rights will be going forward.  There might be issues in terms of using bitcoin privately – with regulated services – and that's just unavoidable because the issue is on the regulated banking side. To me, that is a short-term adoption growing pain while people are actually still connected to the traditional financial system. In the future, ideally, you are looking at a bitcoin circular economy. People are not going to be buying bitcoin, they are going to be earning bitcoin through their jobs. They are not going to be selling bitcoin, they are going to be spending bitcoin. All of a sudden, those regulated entities that are attached to the banking system are way less crucial.  Do people actually care enough about privacy?  There are a lot of good arguments that they do not, that they could not give two [rhymes with “mitts”]. I mean, they have Alexa in their house. They have Google Home in their house. They have a smartwatch on their wrist. They are sending their DNA out to companies. There are plenty of examples of the overwhelming majority of people trading convenience for security and privacy.  There is a bright side with things like Signal or iMessage, which bridge the gap between the trade-offs of encryption and convenience. Bitcoiners should study Signal’s adoption – how they polished it as much as possible while providing good privacy guarantees. You want to make it as convenient as possible to reduce friction for people's needs. It cannot be much more expensive or more difficult than a regular bitcoin transaction. Ideally, it could be cheaper.  My most optimistic take on privacy sounds really pessimistic. We have never been in a world that is so digital and open to corporate and government surveillance. What is going to happen is as more of our lives are online, we are going to see more and more leaks, hacks and compromises that put people at risk. As that happens, people will get burned, and when they get burned, they will seek out better alternatives.  At that point, it is important we have the tools and resources available for them so they can actually execute on that plan. But unfortunately, I think the majority of people will not wake up until they get burned.  Why haven’t CoinJoins become more popular?  I think, first of all, there has been a decent amount of traction. It has not been a miserable failure. Small steps, right? The overwhelming majority of people are not using CoinJoin. I think there are a couple of reasons. First, it is significantly more expensive than a regular native bitcoin transaction. Second, it is not exactly intuitive. The required tools are getting built and they are already much more user-friendly than they were a year ago. The team at Samourai Wallet has done a great job making using bitcoin privately much easier. Like everything else, it is a matter of reducing friction whether that's cost or UX.  The third thing is a lot of people are just not actually transacting in bitcoin. No one is sending bitcoin privately or receiving bitcoin privately because they are just buying and holding. And of that subset, a lot of people are just onboarding directly onto custodial services, and they are not actually even taking custody themselves.  So if we're going to talk about increasing CoinJoin adoption, you have to get people to actually send and receive bitcoin first.  What do you make of the fungibility concerns about “washed coins?”  That is another point. There is a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding CoinJoin. If people are in the short-term fiat game, they are thinking about whether or not they can sell their bitcoin in the future on a regulated service. That is a reasonable concern – that they are not going to be able to sell bitcoin with a CoinJoin history. Personally, I think that is a short-term fear. Long term, if we cannot spend bitcoin with the CoinJoin history, then Bitcoin in general is going to have larger problems than your individual stack. Bitcoin would have basically failed at that point.  Why is that?  It is a matter of fungibility. If you did a CoinJoin eight hops ago or received bitcoin with an UTXO [unspent transaction output] 10 hops ago – is that coin “nonspendable?” If I am a shop owner and accept bitcoin, do I have to [survey] you to make sure that it's the right bitcoin or something?  In the short term – if you are a trader – I completely respect the viewpoint that CoinJoin is not for you. Keep your options open. But I am not in it for trading bitcoin – it is a long-term game of accumulation. I think you should operate under the assumption that you are never going to sell on a regulated exchange and will spend it eventually. If that is the viewpoint, then it is not a real concern.  This reminds me of Kevin O’Leary’s thoughts on “clean” and “dirty” bitcoin, where he thinks institutions will only want to deal with environmentally-neutral coins. But white and black markets can spring up in a lot of ways – FATF-compliant crypto, crypto tied to hacks. Isn’t this inevitable?  You know, in 2013, there was a big push for merchant adoption, but it was done in a nonproductive way. Regulated startups like BitPay came in, offered companies the ability to accept bitcoin and immediately sell it for fiat. The whole thing was centralized and regulated. You were not really using bitcoin; you were selling it to a third party to buy goods and services in fiat. To me that's not a proper circular economy.  Something like BTCPay Server that allows everyone to, in a sovereign way, accept bitcoin themselves with open source software rather than outsource it is an absolute game changer. We are seeing other open source projects like Satsale and CypherpunkPay emerge that provide this very easy to use open source stack to receive bitcoin. All of a sudden merchants around the world can accept bitcoin without KYC requirements, without banking relationships and might even be able to accept bitcoin in situations where they cannot accept fiat.  See also: The Myths and Realities of 'Green Bitcoin'  There are probably more merchants than you would think that want to receive bitcoin. They are the type that will not immediately sell for fiat and want bitcoin in a sovereign way without taking on intimate KYC information. There are businesses that want to stack sats [i.e., slowly accumulate bitcoin in small amounts] – so they offer discounts for payments in bitcoin or even refuse fiat. If you want to buy a Nodl [a bitcoin hardware product], you have to pay in bitcoin. You cannot get it any other way.  As things start to emerge, we will see more and more people using bitcoin in a slow, organic way. Bitcoin is ultimately a permissionless open system, there is really no way to force people to use it. People will find the need and will start to use it more.  That’s the circular economy. If you really want to make it happen, shouldn’t you similarly resist accepting KYC bitcoin in the same way that Kevin O’Leary won’t touch contaminated coins?  Ultimately, whether or not people want to use KYC services to onboard onto Bitcoin is a personal decision. Bitcoin is a system that relies on personal responsibility, and people should make their own decisions based on their own personal situation. My biggest issue with KYC right now is that I do not think the trade-offs are very clear to people who are onboarding and using it. I don't think they realize that KYC is forever and that there will always be a record of how much bitcoin you purchased, when you bought it and where you sent it. All that can be used going forward or backwards to track you on-chain. So users should be aware of that.  It is very much a personal issue because it puts users at risk of theft, extortion and persecution. If an authoritarian government knows you bought bitcoin, they could put you in jail or seize your coins. Or if your KYC information leaks, malicious criminals might try to rob or extort you. We're seeing so many newcomers come in and sign up for like eight different services – they are sending their passport and selfies to all these different places that are all secured horribly.  Have you considered Zcash or Monero?  I think Zcash is just a dead-end project. There's concerns about the math being overly complicated. They had an inflation bug that took a while to detect. And I think even to this day, [people] are not 100% sure if it is compromised. Worse, it was a situation where two or three people knew about it while they were trying to patch it – this undetectable bug – so you have that centralization risk. But besides the math, it is a U.S.-based company with U.S.-based VCs that have a massive amount of influence on it that still takes out a pre-mined reward every block. To my mind, that is a complete disqualifier.  Monero, on the other hand, is novel and unique and can provide very good transactional privacy. But there's two things here. First, long term, I expect bitcoin to significantly outperform monero with respect to purchasing power. Monero is less hard money because you do not have the ability to verify its supply without trusting complicated math assumptions. You cannot have both – there is a trade-off and they went with privacy. So, as a result, money will flow to the harder money, which is bitcoin.  See also: Monero: The Privacy Coin Explained  The funny thing is, because monero is getting removed from regulated exchanges – they have made it easy to swap with bitcoin. Instead of relying on regulated exchanges, they rely on bitcoin as their on-ramp and off-ramp. That means bitcoin users today can easily swap into monero basically as a private sidechain for transactions. It is a utility token but because XMR is trending to zero against bitcoin, there is no reason for you to hold the actual token long term.  That’s especially true once real privacy solutions are solved in Bitcoin, so to me both projects are flawed long term but for different reasons.  I’m about 90% of the way to being a bitcoiner, but it seems like there’s always a lot of solutionism [and widespread assumption] that problems – be they privacy, environmental, the fee economy – will always have a solution eventually. Why not be more pragmatic and use the worse tools for the better today?  There is a disconnect there, right? It's something that is very frustrating to me about the bitcoin world, and it is not just a privacy thing. You normally will not hear a developer say anything like that, but on Bitcoin Twitter, you hear it all the time, “oh, this will fix it. We'll figure it out.”  The privacy world in general cares more about practical solutions today because it is a real- world situation today. It is something that we absolutely need today. I do wish that there was more priority placed on some of these pressing issues but expect more people to get burned before the need for better privacy tools is realized.

42411509,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSjU,1646852494,Why Russian Sanctions Could Push Corporations Towards Crypto,"The stunning excommunication of Russia from the global financial system will dramatically reshape the way global entities of all sorts move money. According to one corporate treasury expert, that will likely include more openness to cryptocurrency as a way for big companies to do business around the world.  “Going forward, you will see more [corporate] adoption,” said Mitch Thomas of FinLync, a corporate treasury services firm. “You will see more conversations among corporate finance and treasury officials.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Given the risks of smaller fiat currencies and the potential for the West to restrict access to the dollar-based economy, companies could potentially look to crypto – non-state, universally accessible and censorship-resistant monetary networks – as “a global settlement system,” Thomas said.  Thomas thinks big companies are having those conversations internally right now. “Should we be looking into how to invoice and settle in crypto in the future? Not just for situations like [the war in Ukraine], but for countries where corporates don’t care to have banking or don’t want to be exposed to a very risky Middle Eastern or African or South American currency?”  Thomas is North American head of solutions engineering for FinLync, which provides a non-SWIFT method for connecting corporations and banks as well as treasury management services.  Thomas does not foresee a broad shift towards crypto or other digital tools for payments, though, in part because corporate usage hasn’t reached enough saturation to create network efficiency.  “There aren’t enough companies that have fully thought through the ability to settle and trust company invoices with cryptocurrency … So I don’t see it being used broadly from a corporate perspective,” he said.  Fragmentary adoption of crypto for trade with marginal nations is not, to be clear, good news on the whole. Post-9/11 banking restrictions, usually framed as “de-risking,” have already led to many banks in geopolitically troubled regions losing access to the global financial system, with serious impacts for everyday people. Moving so swiftly against Russia will hopefully help save Ukrainian lives, but in the longer term many agree with Thomas’ prediction of further financial fragmentation.  That would inevitably put downward pressure on the global economy. Remember your Adam Smith: Division of labor and specialization increase productivity, but shrinking and restricting markets interferes with the ability to specialize. This strangulation would be slow and subtle, its impacts stretched over not years, but decades.  At the highest level, it aligns with other trends towards “de-globalization,” such as America’s (so far largely rhetorical) effort to “re-shore” medical production and other key industries from China. From the fragile hyper-efficiency of just-in-time production, we are shifting back to a world of shorter supply chains – but also higher costs and lower profits.  See also: Bitcoin Is 'Armageddon Insurance'? | The Node  Crypto can be seen in similar terms. As anyone who understands blockchains knows, they are less efficient in most senses than traditional trust-based banking. At least in the case of global payments, crypto is not so much a hopeful bit of technological progress as an emergency backstop when human frailty undermines the current streamlined but politically fragile banking network.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,David Z.

The &apos;daily trading volume&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin being transacted on the blockchain on any given day. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the BTC network is becoming more active as a larger amount of coins are being moved around on the chain. On the other hand, when the value of the volume decreases, it implies the network is turning less active. Such a trend may be there because investors are waiting for the crypto to reach certain price targets before they make their move.

However, tools like the stock-to-flow (S2F) model can be used to make investments rationally. Just like the traditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the S2F model can help anticipate the price of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Let&apos;s understand what is the stock-to-flow (S2F) model and analyze its accuracy for crypto price prediction in this article. Stock-to-flow ratio Explained The S2F ratio provides a number that indicates the number of years crypto will take to reach the current supply (at the current production rate). In general, with the highest number, the crypto asset will be more expensive too. An institutional investor called &apos;Plan B&apos; popularized the concept of the S2F ratio. The SF ratio has a long history of being connected with the price of Bitcoin (BTC), making it a popular approach for predicting future BTC price estimates. Bitcoin is the first and most well-known rare digital object globally, and its supply is limited, just like silver and gold, with only 21 million coins in circulation. The value of Bitcoin increases because of its scarcity, and the S2F takes advantage of this fact to predict Bitcoin&apos;s future price. Bitcoin&apos;s core technology ensures that the number of new coins issued decreases over time, increasing scarcity.

42395865,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzbke,1646851703,"Helium Miners From Lisbon to Miami Say It's Location, Location, Location","Chris Grundemann, a former network engineer and technology consultant, has a Helium hotspot on the roof of his home in El Paso, Texas. It took a day to set it up, but he had waited over nine months for the unit to arrive and was keen to get it in the best possible position to maximize his earnings from mining HNT – the native tokens of the Helium network.  ""I spent my Sunday morning drilling holes in my walls and climbing up on my roof,"" Grundemann tweeted on Jan. 30.  So far, six weeks in, Grundemann has made a total of 6 HNT ($133).  The Helium network is a crypto-powered distributed network of long-range wireless hotspots, and the operators range from digital-asset enthusiasts to more practical-minded internet users who want an alternative to the often pricey service available from entrenched local cable companies and telephone utilities.  The network started off with just 14,000 hotspots at the beginning of last year and now has about 631,000. Helium miners are scattered around the globe, ranging from small islands in the Maldives with populations as small as 3,600 to densely populated areas of the United States.  While Helium describes itself as “the People’s Network” based on the fact it's a decentralized project, the price of a Helium hotspot might pose a barrier to entry for some, given the $400 starting point. In some cases, the earnings can be substantial, but some Helium operators are finding that the revenue barely justifies the outlay or the effort.  Purchasing hotspots can be done through third-party manufacturers like Bobcat Miners, Cal Chip Connect and Nebra, to name a few. These vendors have received approval from the Helium community to sell the hotspots. Some providers have faced criticism recently because of shipping delays.  In a recent initiative by San Jose, Calif., where more than 95,000 people lack internet access, the mayor’s Office of Technology and Innovation deployed hotspots to volunteer residents and small businesses across the city for a pilot program. The participants mined HNT, and the token rewards were then used to provide broadband internet access to low-income households.  The amount of HNT miners earn depends on location. The network involves physical real-world network coverage, and because of that, miners need to take location into account when working out potential mining earnings.  For example, major metropolitan areas are heavily saturated and therefore miners’ crypto rewards are smaller.  James Putra, head of product strategy at TradeStation, has a Nebra Helium miner set up in his home in Miami. Putra’s hotspot reaches other miners as far as 22 miles away and has even communicated with another hotspot in the Bimini islands in the Bahamas.  But because of the number of other miners in Putra’s area, his HNT rewards aren't as impressive as if he were located farther away.  In the last 30 days, Putra has gained $43.63 worth of HNT through his Miami-based hotspot.  “I don’t look at it as a business, it's more of a hobby for me,” he said.  Putra says he has since bought five more miners and distributed them to friends and family members.  The trick, according to Putra, is to set up in an area that's less saturated but still within range of other Helium hotspots. “Hotspot users don’t want to be the only one in the middle of nowhere as there will be no connectivity,” Putra said.  Manuel Pereira, a student based in Lisbon, Portugal, says his hotspot managed to reach 107 miles away. He used a Bobcat Miner 300, a high-efficiency unit that costs around $600.  Pereira told CoinDesk in an interview that he also has a long-range antenna with a 6.5 dBi (dBi is used to measure antenna performance), which contributed to the long reach. He said that the weather conditions that week also helped the signal spread to a longer range. Pereira plans to increase the height of his hotspot in order for his miner to reach even farther out.  How much miners earn is visible to the public on the Helium explorer page.  For context, a hotspot named “Zealous Yellow Dragonfly,” located just above Chicago, earned $404 in HNT over the last 30 days as seen in the image below.  There are some exceptions to hotspots in heavily saturated areas, Frank Mong, Helium’s chief operating officer, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “Even in heavily saturated areas, earning potential could be totally different if the location of the hotspot is at the top of a high-rise condo, for example,” Mong said.  The engineering considerations are similar to the way some radio signals can travel only a couple of blocks in places like New York, according to Mong. Large buildings get in the way.  Raina Saboo, a Google employee from California, waited over seven months for her hotspot to arrive. Saboo said she ordered the hotspot to generate a passive income but has been disappointed with her earnings; she figures that there are too many other miners close by and that she doesn't have the best installation setup.  Since September, Saboo has earned 10 HNT ($210). “Although the rewards are low, it’s still worth it for me because it requires zero effort on my part,” she said.  “Because of this, I have bought additional HNT tokens on exchanges as I am bullish on the project,” Saboo said.  HNT tokens were trading at around $22 as of press time, up 400% in one year.  A network for everyone?  One obstacle to further growth might be the daunting cost of a new unit.  In order to tackle the barrier to entry, Arman Dezfuli-Arjomandi founded a startup called FairSpot that allows miners in the U.S. to finance their initial capital outlays – similar to a rent-to-own model.  Miners keep 70% of their earnings and FairSpot takes the remaining 30%. After 500 days of mining, the hotspot's ownership transfers from FairSpot to the user.  Applicants are accepted based on their location and to some degree their financial situation.  “We try to emphasize giving to those that are less advantaged when selecting,” Arjomandi said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Arjomandi said that the main focus of the business is inclusion, claiming a “racially diverse” user base that's at least 20% female.  “I think Web 3 is an incredible opportunity for many people, but if its main beneficiaries look the same as those who rode the previous waves of wealth creation, I don’t think the world will be a very good place,” Arjomandi said.  On Tuesday, Helium announced a partnership with Techtenna, a high-density LoRaWAN network operator, simplifying end-to-end internet-of-things products for a variety of use cases.  According to the press release, Techtenna plans to deploy more than 2 million devices by 2023 across a wide range of fields such as smart water metering, smart cities, forest conservation and smart agriculture.",NEUTRAL,HNT,BUSINESS | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING | HNT,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/09/helium-miners-from-lisbon-to-miami-say-its-location-location-location,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec070df52f2b74fe8d565c0f7b08963446b2593e-2880x1580.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395861,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzbfj,1646850839,LUNA Surges 25% to New All-Time High of $104,"Terra’s LUNA token rose to as high as $104.58 on Wednesday morning, topping a previous all-time record of $103.34 notched last December.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, LUNA was up 25% over the previous 24 hours. As of press time, the token had pulled back a bit to $102. LUNA has now more than doubled in price since putting in a 2022 low of about $44 in late January. Its current valuation just shy of $38 billion makes it the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  LUNA’s new milestone makes it an outlier among large-cap cryptocurrencies, with names like bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), cardano (ADA), binance (BNB), avalanche (AVAX) and solana (SOL) down 40-70% from all-time highs.  The LUNA/UST relationship  The gains for LUNA are likely thanks to strong demand for sister token TerraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.  UST maintains its dollar peg by burning or issuing LUNA tokens. When the value of UST drops below $1 (for example, to $0.98), holders of UST can convert UST to $1 worth of LUNA (therefore, arbitrageurs can pocket the $0.02 difference).  Conversely, if – as appears to be occurring now – demand for UST drives the price of the token over $1, users can mint additional UST (driving the price of UST back down to $1) by burning the dollar-equivalent amount of LUNA. This burning of LUNA tokens to create UST drives up the price of LUNA.  Anchor Protocol driving UST demand  Behind that strong demand is Terra’s Anchor Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform advertising an annualized percentage yield (APY) of nearly 20% on Terra stablecoins. That high yield compared to other stablecoin lending protocols has attracted an influx of capital into Terra in recent weeks. The total value locked (TVL) on the platform soared to $12.6 billion, making it the largest DeFi protocol by TVL in the Terra ecosystem, according to data provider DeFi Llama.  Anchor is currently paying out a 19.46% APY for users that lock up their UST in the protocol. The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) tweeted last Saturday that it was minting the “maximum amount” of UST to keep up with demand.  In another tweet this morning, the LFG said it would burn the remaining 4.2 million LUNA left in its treasury to provide UST liquidity to the stablecoin decentralized exchange Curve.  To add further tailwinds, Terra co-founder Do Kwon tweeted that the LFG is adding $418 million in reserves to its treasury, bringing its total to $1.5 billion.  The reserves could be used to buy LUNA tokens to convert to UST, or to shore up Anchor’s reserves to pay those sky-high yields to depositors. Either scenario would put upward pressure on the price of LUNA.  CORRECTION (March 9, 8:15 UTC): Corrects to say 4.2 million LUNA tokens.

However, there are constant rumblings of a crash, and the noise has lately increased. Not only due to stocks, a new COVID version and increased interest rates are driving firms to pay more to borrow money. This has prompted a decline in global markets. Cryptocurrency markets have been affected by this, along with worries of increased regulation. How likely is it for the stock market to crash? Taking cryptocurrency out of the equation, the mounting conjecture that a collapse is inevitable is based on sound reasoning. In the United States, the inflation rate was much higher than projected in June. There is currently a debate on lifting the debt limit due to the government&apos;s ongoing issuance of bonds and accumulation of debt. Of course, the continuing pandemic relief effort justifies this. Government stimulus programs are being implemented, although other indicators, like the price of U.S. stocks, show that the money being spent is not necessary. The real estate market in the United States is also booming, and the Federal Reserve has previously voiced worry that investors are growing more irresponsible, citing the interest in-joke stocks and cryptocurrencies as examples.

42395892,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzbgi,1646848580,Biden’s Executive Order on Crypto Met With Relief From Key Industry Players,"The crypto industry breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday as U.S. President Joe Biden finally unveiled his hotly anticipated executive order on crypto.  The order will direct federal agencies to take a unified approach to regulating crypto, tasking them with working together to address the risks of crypto – including consumer protection issues, national security implications, and threats to the financial system – but also calling them to support crypto innovation and ensure the U.S. maintains “technological leadership in this rapidly growing space.”  The order has been the source of much handwringing in the crypto community since its announcement in October. Many were concerned the order would call for sweeping regulatory crackdowns on crypto; the relatively light-touch approach revealed in the fact sheet – no new regulations on the sector and no thumb on the scale for what specific positions the Biden administration wants agencies to adopt – were met with widespread relief.  “It was better than I thought it was going to be,” said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, a Washington, D.C.-based crypto industry group. “Given all of the FUD that has been out there about a regulatory crackdown, I think this is obviously in stark contrast. This is much more positive and thoughtful.”  Big players in the crypto industry took to Twitter on Wednesday to share their thoughts on the executive order. Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX and a major Biden donor, called the order “constructive.” Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire praised the order’s focus on the rapid growth of crypto and its calls for “constructive problem solving around known risks that exist with the legacy financial system.”  Read more: Here's the Full Text of Biden's Executive Order on Cryptocurrency  Regulatory clarity  Many industry participants hope the executive order will address the current, fragmented regulatory environment in which regulation is often achieved through enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Anchorage Digital co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley called the order a “shot in the arm for crypto” and said that, to strike the balance of “responsible innovation” called for by Biden, “the crypto community needs to recognize that – for the benefit of our industry – regulators have a role to play in the crypto ecosystem.”  “Today’s executive order makes it clear: This isn’t them-against-us,” McCauley said.  Candace Kelly, general counsel for Stellar, echoed McCauley’s sentiment.  “Today's order is the first step in what will likely be an extended process to get the industry the clarity we've been seeking,” Kelly told CoinDesk. “We now have a much better understanding of the government's intentions and roadmap for digital assets and a commitment to support innovation in this space.”  A long road ahead  While the promise of regulatory clarity is exciting for many in the crypto sphere, Kelly pointed out that input from industry participants will be key.  “If the desire to get this right is genuine – and we hope it is – it's critical that industry is part of this process and engages in this process every step of the way,” Kelly said.  Crypto lobbying boomed in 2021, but Smith told CoinDesk the executive order means the industry’s efforts to engage with the government will get even more intense.  “There are going to be a lot of questions, a lot of policy solutions proposed, and it’s incumbent upon us in the industry to be a resource to policymakers and bring our own thoughtful solutions to the table,” Smith said.  The process will not be a quick one. The executive order called for agencies, including the Treasury Department, to conduct research and submit reports to the White House on various crypto-related issues – all which can take up to six months.  “This is a very long road ahead on the policymaking front,” Smith said. “But I think this is the place we want to be … it’s the right framework to be thinking about how to regulate the space.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/09/bidens-executive-order-on-crypto-met-with-relief-from-key-industry-players,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a677541aca06ed4cfc21486d7b513e1b2594ecef-5785x3857.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411513,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOStP,1646848184,The NBA’s Web 3 Innovation Dilemma,"Under Commissioner Adam Silver’s leadership the National Basketball Association (NBA) has been the most innovative major professional sports league in the United States. It is thus no surprise it has also been the most crypto forward, most notably inking the partnership with Dapper Labs to create NBA Top Shot. In its first weeks, NBA Top Shot swept mainstream consumers in a way no crypto product has before, and arguably kicked off the non-fungible token (NFT) craze.  While the NBA x Dapper partnership has only scratched the surface of opportunities around digital collectibles and fan engagement, the NBA must now grapple with how to progress its relationship with crypto and Web 3. Is the league ready to embrace not just selective profit-maximizing technologies (like collectible NFT drops) but also the Web 3 ethos of democratized ownership, governance and financial upside. If so, that ethos is seemingly at odds with the interests of its 30 team owners.  Becoming a more Web 3-native league will not be easy and will require the NBA to re-examine its long-held beliefs about its business to maintain its cultural relevance. On the other hand, failing to progress along the Web 3 curve – most notably by allowing the ultimate fan ownership in the team’s themselves – will not have any immediate consequences. But it might threaten the league’s long-term cultural and consumer appeal.  NBA vs. Web 3 mindset  As a business, the NBA – the collective of 30 teams and the league office – seeks to maximize dual objectives of business growth today (revenue) and in the future (increasing fan engagement across generations and geographies) while minimizing the amount of control it needs to give up to achieve these goals. NBA Top Shot has perfectly slotted into this strategy: It has become an attractive new revenue generation tool and a fan engagement tool – a win-win that required no sacrifice on the league’s part.  This optimization lens, however, creates a natural innovation ceiling for the league when it comes to Web 3: NBA’s tight control of its brand, product, and business model is directly at odds with the Web 3 mindset of yielding that control to fans and players – the stakeholders who make the product work.  ConstitutionDAO might have failed at acquiring an original copy of the U.S. Constitution but it succeeded at expanding the realm of what’s possible when it comes to collective purchasing power for even the loftiest and most expensive of things. The idea of a DAO owning a sports team immediately came up next. Fans have whetted their appetites for fan ownership of a sports team. But is the NBA ready?  For years, the NBA disallowed private equity fund investment in teams’ minority positions. Then, in early 2021, the league changed its position, developing a framework for private equity ownership that allows funds to own up to 20% of a single NBA franchise and teams to accept up to 30% of ownership from institutional investors. With those guardrails in place, the league opened itself to new ownership structure in exchange for benefits such as greater liquidity for minority owners in the era of ever-increasing franchise valuations.  Read more: What Is a DAO?  Today, the notion of accepting a team investment from a DAO still sounds preposterous to NBA lifers (partially, to be fair, due to the legal gray area that DAOs currently stand in) but it does not have to be meaningfully different from the prior access opening to institutional capital. The league can, and should thoughtfully design its parameters around an acceptable level of fan involvement through novel ownership structures like DAOs.  What do fans want?  The NBA’s future success depends on fans continuing to watch and spend – the league is nothing without the eyeballs and the wallets. That is why any strategy for long term growth must begin with a question: What do fans really want? The Web 3 rallying cry is decentralized ownership, but is that what fans care really about?  Humans don’t desire ownership per se, but what that ownership enables us to do and feel. Ownership of any asset, including a sports team, is about four fundamental benefits/motivations:  Love/pride: intrinsic satisfaction (“I love this team and so I want to own a piece of it.”)  Status: external signaling (“I want to flex being a team owner.”)  Control: governance and decision-making (“I want to have a say about team’s direction.”)  Greed: financial returns (“I want to benefit from the team value appreciation.”)  Different fans have different motivations, but ultimately at least a couple of these have to be met to generate real fan engagement. Fan tokens like those from Socios have sprung onto the scene to serve those desires with a promise of synthetic team ownership and fan impact on decision-making. Fan reception has been lukewarm at best, and for a good reason. The fan tokens represent innovation incrementally that fails to deliver on their issuers’ lofty promises.  Just DAO it  In theory, companies like Socios present a win-win situation of fan tokens as shadow team ownership, creating an additional revenue stream from token sales for the teams and giving fans a say in certain aspects of team decision-making.  In practice, most if not all fan token programs to date have disappointed, with teams too scared to yield any meaningful decision-making to fans. Asinine polls on topics such as “Who was the player of the month?” could be equally well served by an Instagram poll.  Read more: Most Influential 2021: Dapper Labs' Roham Gharegozlou  As a result, fan tokens fail to deliver on all four of consumer motivations for ownership:  Love/pride: Emotional benefits require real connection that fan tokens have not yet meaningfully provided. Thus far they’ve been monopoly money but without the board to play on or friends to play with.  Status: Easily accessible on an open market (and with teams’ ability to issue more tokens at will), fan tokens no longer allow for flexing. No one flexes “I own Amazon stock” because anyone can own Amazon (AMZN) stock. Fan tokens are no different.  Control: Given teams’ reluctance to offer meaningful decisions up to a fan vote, fan tokens fail on the primary promise of enabling fans to have a say in team decision-making.  Greed: Fan tokens value is fully divorced from franchise value and as such has been a volatile asset driven entirely by short-term demand and crypto sentiment, more aligned with speculators than long term value appreciation holders.  In short, fan tokens (as currently issued) are just an incremental solution that’s more an illusion of Web 3 innovation than real change in the relationship between fans and teams/leagues.  Minority ownership DAOs can better deliver what fan tokens have promised to the fans, while also better serving the league’s long-term goals (because they serve each of the four core ownership motivations). From love/pride to status signaling to governance to financial returns, DAOs deliver a product to fans that’s superior to fan tokens and virtually indistinguishable from minority ownership by an individual, save for a couple of courtside seats (at best!).  In fact, the league can elect to give additional governance input to a DAO vs. an individual minority owner (who truly has no impact on any team decision-making) by treating the DAO as a focus group of incentive-aligned superfans.  Humans don’t care about governance for governance’s sake – governance rights are just a delivery mechanism for what we truly care about, like feeling heard, making an impact, or protecting your investment. As long as expectations are aligned up front that the DAO has no fewer (but also no more) governance rights than any other minority owner, but also that the league genuinely desires the DAO’s advisory input, all parties will be better off than in status quo or a fan token equivalent.  Allowing a DAO to hold a minority ownership position and collaborate with the league can then additionally create a relatively low-stakes learning opportunity for both parties to consider more substantial, control ownership by a community in the future, and the conditions necessary to make it a success.  …Or else?  The NBA is in the spotlight because of its status as the most pro-crypto league today, but it is weighed down by its legacy vested interests from existing stakeholders. It has resources and brand power, but with that it loses its ability to move quickly and experiment without repercussions. This creates an opening for upstarts to take a hold of fan minds, hearts and wallets. Startup leagues like Fan Controlled Football have no long-standing vested interest. They can design incentives and control and money flows from ground up. Under-monetized leagues like Major League Soccer (MLS) or the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) that have smaller but deeper fan bases are also well suited for Web 3 business models. Nothing to lose means an asymmetric upside potential.  Read more: Daryl Morey on Crypto and NFTs: 'It's the Start of a Major, Major Trend'  Just as in a corporate context, less-resourced but more nimble upstarts have opportunity to innovate and disrupt from below. If, or rather when, one league cracks the code on delivering an exciting Web 3-native product that turns fans into incentive-aligned shareholders, it will have substantial repercussions on the appeal of every other league lagging in making that shift. The next generation of fans is too tech-native and too demanding to be satisfied with legacy approaches.  Dear Adam Silver  The NBA is a top-notch product with global appeal and a younger fan base than the other major pro sports leagues in the United States. It does not need to innovate immediately to stay relevant today, but it is in this enviable position compared to leagues such as Major League Baseball or the National Hockey League precisely because it has not been afraid to embrace new technologies and take bold initiatives under Adam Silver’s stewardship. Web 3 is in its infancy and calls on everyone to experiment and learn-by-doing. The NBA should be no different.  The approach needs to begin with fans – understanding current NBA and WNBA fans across the core fandom segmentations, from demographics (age, willingness to spend) to type (team-first versus player-first) to intensity (casual to superfan) with respect to their deeper engagement needs and wants, then crafting experiments and solutions that seek to serve them.  For years, the WNBA has been treated as the immature sister – now it’s time to shine as the more nimble, energetic sibling that understands and implements technology faster. It’s no secret the WNBA remains a cost center for the NBA. There is no reason not to turn that into an opportunity as NBA’s de facto Web 3 innovation lab.  The league office first broached the topic of institutional minority investments with the team owners in 2019 and didn’t implement it until two years later – changes for such prized brands as NBA take time, which is why it’s important to begin considerations around fan ownership right now.  The innovator’s dilemma is scary because it requires some sacrifice in the present in exchange for survival and/or growth in the future. In the grand scheme of things, though, allowing minority ownership by fans is not a huge sacrifice at all. It’s one that can redefine and elevate the league’s relationship with its fans. If any of the major leagues in the U.S. can do it, it’s the NBA.

42411510,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOScs,1646848079,President Biden’s Crypto Order Is a Huge Step Forward for the Industry,"President Joe Biden’s executive order on digital asset innovation – directing federal agencies to study the industry and report on regulatory authority – is a major milestone for the industry in the United States.  If you are bullish on the long-term possibilities for cryptocurrencies to transform many of the foundational services of our lives, then this recognition by the federal government of crypto's fundamental importance can only be viewed as an affirmation of that position. The industry welcomes the open dialogue. The debate is no longer whether crypto will survive; the debate has shifted to encouraging responsible innovation and how the U.S. can maintain a leadership position in this innovation.  Kristin Smith is the executive director of the Blockchain Association, the Washington D.C.-based trade association representing the most prominent and reputable organizations in the crypto industry.  A short time ago, policymakers typically viewed crypto with some combination of confusion, derision or apathy. Even just last summer, Congress slapped misguided Internal Revenue Service requirements on crypto entities to raise cash for the infrastructure bill. Now, the president of the United States is publicly saying that the federal government must do its due diligence before moving forward with new regulation.  By directing federal agencies to study crypto, the president is acknowledging the importance of getting the regulation of this space right. Crypto is regulated today by a patchwork of directions from multiple agencies, from the IRS to the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Treasury Department's FinCEN. Some of those guidelines are vague, others are contradictory and many of them fail to adequately set clear and consistent rules that nurture crypto innovation while protecting consumers.  The current regulatory landscape will only cause more challenges for crypto as the industry matures. Entrepreneurs and founders can’t focus on growing their business, creating jobs and providing the best services to consumers if they’re ensnared in uncertainty. That’s why the crypto industry has repeatedly called for an open and productive conversation with government. President Biden’s executive order brings us closer to that goal.  However, an executive order can only go so far. We need the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue – Congress – to examine if legislation is needed. As history proves, this type of action can have enormous benefits for our society.  Read more: Biden’s Executive Order on Crypto Met With Relief From Key Industry Players  In the 1990s, a novel technology called the internet was growing fast, and regulators suddenly had to grapple with how to address it. Ultimately, Congress passed legislation that provided clear rules and necessary protections while giving tech companies the breathing room to create better products. If Congress considers the same for crypto as it did for the internet, then we could see a similar explosion of innovation.  That innovation could have an impact on communities. Crypto technology has the power to provide financial services to the unbanked and underbanked, give individuals control over their finances, make data storage secure and private, and so much more.  None of that will be possible without clear rules for the industry.  Crypto is a transformative technology that’s simply too important to leave to a scattershot of regulations, and it’s very encouraging that President Biden recognizes this in his executive order. Now, the rest of the government should follow his lead and help power the crypto boom of the 21st century.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Kristin Smith,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/09/president-bidens-crypto-order-is-a-huge-step-forward-for-the-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fa51ab905c7aa0d638aee4027175e46476ca2b7-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Called FTX Access, the new unit will eventually seek to offer custody, derivatives, structured products and other asset management products, according to a press release on Wednesday.  ""The role crypto plays in the global financial landscape continues to expand, and with that comes an influx of institutions looking to add crypto to their balance sheets,” FTX’s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said in the release. “To make the transition into the digital asset ecosystem seamless for these institutions, we have launched FTX Access in order to provide these companies with familiar services.”  FTX named Gustavo Miguel as U.S. head of FTX Access. Miguel was previously a founding member of Coinbase Risk Strategies, where he served as the global head of derivatives.  FTX’s move comes as crypto exchanges continue to build out their offerings for institutional investors. U.S.-based Coinbase (COIN) said last year it would be opening its prime brokerage to all institutional investors. Its prime brokerage offering stems from the exchange’s acquisition of Tagomi in May 2020.

42395853,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzbYq,1646845549,Here's the Full Text of Biden's Executive Order on Cryptocurrency,"On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a long-awaited executive order directing various federal agencies to coordinate on policy for digital assets. The verbatim text from the White House briefing room appears below.  By the authority vested in me as president by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:  Section 1. Policy. Advances in digital and distributed ledger technology for financial services have led to dramatic growth in markets for digital assets, with profound implications for the protection of consumers, investors and businesses, including data privacy and security; financial stability and systemic risk; crime; national security; the ability to exercise human rights; financial inclusion and equity; and energy demand and climate change. In November 2021, non‑state issued digital assets reached a combined market capitalization of $3 trillion, up from approximately $14 billion in early November 2016. Monetary authorities globally are also exploring, and in some cases introducing, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). While many activities involving digital assets are within the scope of existing domestic laws and regulations, an area where the United States has been a global leader, growing development and adoption of digital assets and related innovations, as well as inconsistent controls to defend against certain key risks, necessitate an evolution and alignment of the United States government approach to digital assets. The United States has an interest in responsible financial innovation, expanding access to safe and affordable financial services and reducing the cost of domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments, including through the continued modernization of public payment systems. We must take strong steps to reduce the risks that digital assets could pose to consumers, investors and business protections; financial stability and financial system integrity; combating and preventing crime and illicit finance; national security; the ability to exercise human rights; financial inclusion and equity; and climate change and pollution.  Sec. 2. Objectives. The principal policy objectives of the United States with respect to digital assets are as follows:  (a) We must protect consumers, investors and businesses in the United States. The unique and varied features of digital assets can pose significant financial risks to consumers, investors and businesses if appropriate protections are not in place. In the absence of sufficient oversight and standards, firms providing digital asset services may provide inadequate protections for sensitive financial data, custodial and other arrangements relating to customer assets and funds, or disclosures of risks associated with investment. Cybersecurity and market failures at major digital asset exchanges and trading platforms have resulted in billions of dollars in losses. The United States should ensure that safeguards are in place and promote the responsible development of digital assets to protect consumers, investors and businesses; maintain privacy; and shield against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance, which can contribute to human rights abuses.  (b) We must protect United States and global financial stability and mitigate systemic risk. Some digital asset trading platforms and service providers have grown rapidly in size and complexity and may not be subject to or in compliance with appropriate regulations or supervision. Digital asset issuers, exchanges and trading platforms and intermediaries whose activities may increase risks to financial stability should, as appropriate, be subject to and in compliance with regulatory and supervisory standards that govern traditional market infrastructures and financial firms, in line with the general principle of “same business, same risks, same rules.” The new and unique uses and functions that digital assets can facilitate may create additional economic and financial risks requiring an evolution to a regulatory approach that adequately addresses those risks.  (c) We must mitigate the illicit finance and national security risks posed by misuse of digital assets. Digital assets may pose significant illicit finance risks, including money laundering, cybercrime and ransomware, narcotics and human trafficking, and terrorism and proliferation financing. Digital assets may also be used as a tool to circumvent United States and foreign financial sanctions regimes and other tools and authorities. Further, while the United States has been a leader in setting international standards for the regulation and supervision of digital assets for anti‑money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), poor or nonexistent implementation of those standards in some jurisdictions abroad can present significant illicit financing risks for the United States and global financial systems. Illicit actors, including the perpetrators of ransomware incidents and other cybercrime, often launder and cash out of their illicit proceeds using digital asset service providers in jurisdictions that have not yet effectively implemented the international standards set by the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The continued availability of service providers in jurisdictions where international AML/CFT standards are not effectively implemented enables financial activity without illicit finance controls. Growth in decentralized financial ecosystems, peer-to-peer payment activity and obscured blockchain ledgers without controls to mitigate illicit finance could also present additional market and national security risks in the future. The United States must ensure appropriate controls and accountability for current and future digital assets systems to promote high standards for transparency, privacy and security – including through regulatory, governance and technological measures – that counter illicit activities and preserve or enhance the efficacy of our national security tools. When digital assets are abused or used in illicit ways or undermine national security, it is in the national interest to take actions to mitigate these illicit finance and national security risks through regulation, oversight, law enforcement action or use of other United States government authorities.  (d) We must reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system and in technological and economic competitiveness, including through the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets. The United States has an interest in ensuring that it remains at the forefront of responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system, particularly in setting standards that promote: democratic values; the rule of law; privacy; the protection of consumers, investors and businesses; and interoperability with digital platforms, legacy architecture and international payment systems. The United States derives significant economic and national security benefits from the central role that the United States dollar and United States financial institutions and markets play in the global financial system. Continued United States leadership in the global financial system will sustain United States financial power and promote United States economic interests.  (e) We must promote access to safe and affordable financial services. Many Americans are underbanked and the costs of cross-border money transfers and payments are high. The United States has a strong interest in promoting responsible innovation that expands equitable access to financial services, particularly for those Americans underserved by the traditional banking system, including by making investments and domestic and cross-border funds transfers and payments cheaper, faster and safer, and by promoting greater and more cost-efficient access to financial products and services. The United States also has an interest in ensuring that the benefits of financial innovation are enjoyed equitably by all Americans and that any disparate impacts of financial innovation are mitigated.  (f) We must support technological advances that promote responsible development and use of digital assets. The technological architecture of different digital assets has substantial implications for privacy, national security, the operational security and resilience of financial systems, climate change, the ability to exercise human rights and other national goals. The United States has an interest in ensuring that digital asset technologies and the digital payments ecosystem are developed, designed and implemented in a responsible manner that includes privacy and security in their architecture, integrates features and controls that defend against illicit exploitation and reduces negative climate impacts and environmental pollution, as may result from some cryptocurrency mining.  Sec. 3. Coordination. The assistant to the president for National Security Affairs (APNSA) and the assistant to the president for Economic Policy (APEP) shall coordinate, through the interagency process described in National Security Memorandum 2 of February 4, 2021 (Renewing the National Security Council System), the executive branch actions necessary to implement this order. The interagency process shall include, as appropriate: the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the attorney general, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the director of National Intelligence, the director of the Domestic Policy Council, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the director of the National Science Foundation and the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. Representatives of other executive departments and agencies (agencies) and other senior officials may be invited to attend interagency meetings as appropriate, including with due respect for their regulatory independence representatives of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other federal regulatory agencies.  Sec. 4. Policy and Actions Related to United States Central Bank Digital Currencies.  (a) The policy of my administration on a United States CBDC is as follows: (i) Sovereign money is at the core of a well-functioning financial system, macroeconomic stabilization policies and economic growth. My administration places the highest urgency on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options of a United States CBDC. These efforts should include assessments of possible benefits and risks for consumers, investors and businesses; financial stability and systemic risk; payment systems; national security; the ability to exercise human rights; financial inclusion and equity; and the actions required to launch a United States CBDC if doing so is deemed to be in the national interest. (ii) My administration sees merit in showcasing United States leadership and participation in international fora related to CBDCs and in multi‑country conversations and pilot projects involving CBDCs. Any future dollar payment system should be designed in a way that is consistent with United States priorities (as outlined in section 4 (a)(i) of this order) and democratic values, including privacy protections and that ensures the global financial system has appropriate transparency, connectivity and platform and architecture interoperability or transferability, as appropriate. (iii) A United States CBDC may have the potential to support efficient and low-cost transactions, particularly for cross‑border funds transfers and payments and to foster greater access to the financial system, with fewer of the risks posed by private sector-administered digital assets. A United States CBDC that is interoperable with CBDCs issued by other monetary authorities could facilitate faster and lower-cost cross-border payments and potentially boost economic growth, support the continued centrality of the United States within the international financial system and help to protect the unique role that the dollar plays in global finance. There are also, however, potential risks and downsides to consider. We should prioritize timely assessments of potential benefits and risks under various designs to ensure that the United States remains a leader in the international financial system.  (b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the director of National Intelligence and the heads of other relevant agencies shall submit to the president a report on the future of money and payment systems, including the conditions that drive broad adoption of digital assets; the extent to which technological innovation may influence these outcomes; and the implications for the United States financial system, the modernization of and changes to payment systems, economic growth, financial inclusion and national security. This report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. Based on the potential United States CBDC design options, this report shall include an analysis of: (i) the potential implications of a United States CBDC, based on the possible design choices, for national interests, including implications for economic growth and stability; (ii) the potential implications a United States CBDC might have on financial inclusion; (iii) the potential relationship between a CBDC and private sector-administered digital assets; (iv) the future of sovereign and privately produced money globally and implications for our financial system and democracy; (v) the extent to which foreign CBDCs could displace existing currencies and alter the payment system in ways that could undermine United States financial centrality; (vi) the potential implications for national security and financial crime, including an analysis of illicit financing risks, sanctions risks, other law enforcement and national security interests, and implications for human rights; and (vii) an assessment of the effects that the growth of foreign CBDCs may have on United States interests generally.  (c) The chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (chairman of the Federal Reserve) is encouraged to continue to research and report on the extent to which CBDCs could improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of existing and future payments systems, to continue to assess the optimal form of a United States CBDC and to develop a strategic plan for Federal Reserve and broader United States government action, as appropriate, that evaluates the necessary steps and requirements for the potential implementation and launch of a United States CBDC. The chairman of the Federal Reserve is also encouraged to evaluate the extent to which a United States CBDC, based on the potential design options, could enhance or impede the ability of monetary policy to function effectively as a critical macroeconomic stabilization tool.  (d) The attorney general, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, shall: (i) within 180 days of the date of this order, provide to the president through the APNSA and APEP an assessment of whether legislative changes would be necessary to issue a United States CBDC, should it be deemed appropriate and in the national interest; and (ii) within 210 days of the date of this order, provide to the president through the APNSA and the APEP a corresponding legislative proposal, based on consideration of the report submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 4(b) of this order and any materials developed by the chairman of the Federal Reserve consistent with section 4 (c) of this order.  Sec. 5. Measures to Protect Consumers, Investors and Businesses.  (a) The increased use of digital assets and digital asset exchanges and trading platforms may increase the risks of crimes such as fraud and theft, other statutory and regulatory violations, privacy and data breaches, unfair and abusive acts or practices and other cyber incidents faced by consumers, investors and businesses. The rise in use of digital assets and differences across communities may also present disparate financial risk to less informed market participants or exacerbate inequities. It is critical to ensure that digital assets do not pose undue risks to consumers, investors or businesses and to put in place protections as a part of efforts to expand access to safe and affordable financial services.  (b) Consistent with the goals stated in section 5(a) of this order: (i) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the heads of other relevant agencies, including, as appropriate, the heads of independent regulatory agencies such as the FTC, the SEC, the CFTC, federal banking agencies and the CFPB shall submit to the president a report, or section of the report required by section 4 of this order, on the implications of developments and adoption of digital assets and changes in financial market and payment system infrastructures for United States consumers, investors, businesses and for equitable economic growth. One section of the report shall address the conditions that would drive mass adoption of different types of digital assets and the risks and opportunities such growth might present to United States consumers, investors and businesses, including a focus on how technological innovation may impact these efforts and with an eye toward those most vulnerable to disparate impacts. The report shall also include policy recommendations, including potential regulatory and legislative actions, as appropriate, to protect United States consumers, investors and businesses, and support expanding access to safe and affordable financial services. The report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. (ii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the chief technology officer of the United States, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit to the president a technical evaluation of the technological infrastructure, capacity and expertise that would be necessary at relevant agencies to facilitate and support the introduction of a CBDC system should one be proposed. The evaluation should specifically address the technical risks of the various designs, including with respect to emerging and future technological developments, such as quantum computing. The evaluation should also include any reflections or recommendations on how the inclusion of digital assets in federal processes may affect the work of the United States government and the provision of government services, including risks and benefits to cybersecurity, customer experience and social‑safety‑net programs. The evaluation shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. (iii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the attorney general, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit to the president a report on the role of law enforcement agencies in detecting, investigating and prosecuting criminal activity related to digital assets. The report shall include any recommendations on regulatory or legislative actions, as appropriate. (iv) The attorney general, the chair of the FTC, and the director of the CFPB are each encouraged to consider what, if any, effects the growth of digital assets could have on competition policy. (v) The chair of the FTC and the director of the CFPB are each encouraged to consider the extent to which privacy or consumer protection measures within their respective jurisdictions may be used to protect users of digital assets and whether additional measures may be needed. (vi) The chair of the SEC, the chairman of the CFTC, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency are each encouraged to consider the extent to which investor and market protection measures within their respective jurisdictions may be used to address the risks of digital assets and whether additional measures may be needed. (vii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Energy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the assistant to the president and National Climate Advisor and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the president on the connections between distributed ledger technology and short-, medium- and long-term economic and energy transitions; the potential for these technologies to impede or advance efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad; and the impacts these technologies have on the environment. This report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. The report should also address the effect of cryptocurrencies’ consensus mechanisms on energy usage, including research into potential mitigating measures and alternative mechanisms of consensus and the design tradeoffs those may entail. The report should specifically address: (A) potential uses of blockchain that could support monitoring or mitigating technologies to climate impacts, such as exchanging of liabilities for greenhouse gas emissions, water and other natural or environmental assets; and (B) implications for energy policy, including as it relates to grid management and reliability, energy efficiency incentives and standards, and sources of energy supply. (viii) Within one year of submission of the report described in section 5(b)(vii) of this order, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Energy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall update the report described in section 5(b)(vii) of this order, including to address any knowledge gaps identified in such report.  Sec. 6. Actions to Promote Financial Stability, Mitigate Systemic Risk, and Strengthen Market Integrity.  (a) Financial regulators – including the SEC, the CFTC and the CFPB and federal banking agencies – play critical roles in establishing and overseeing protections across the financial system that safeguard its integrity and promote its stability. Since 2017, the Secretary of the Treasury has convened the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to assess the financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by the ongoing adoption of digital assets. The United States must assess and take steps to address risks that digital assets pose to financial stability and financial market integrity.  (b) Within 210 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury should convene the FSOC and produce a report outlining the specific financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by various types of digital assets and providing recommendations to address such risks. As the Secretary of the Treasury and the FSOC deem appropriate, the report should consider the particular features of various types of digital assets and include recommendations that address the identified financial stability risks posed by these digital assets, including any proposals for additional or adjusted regulation and supervision as well as for new legislation. The report should take account of the prior analyses and assessments of the FSOC, agencies and the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, including the ongoing work of the federal banking agencies, as appropriate.  Sec. 7. Actions to Limit Illicit Finance and Associated National Security Risks.  (a) Digital assets have facilitated sophisticated cybercrime‑related financial networks and activity, including through ransomware activity. The growing use of digital assets in financial activity heightens risks of crimes such as money laundering, terrorist and proliferation financing, fraud and theft schemes, and corruption. These illicit activities highlight the need for ongoing scrutiny of the use of digital assets, the extent to which technological innovation may impact such activities and exploration of opportunities to mitigate these risks through regulation, supervision, public‑private engagement, oversight and law enforcement.  (b) Within 90 days of submission to the Congress of the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, the attorney general, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the director of National Intelligence and the heads of other relevant agencies may each submit to the president supplemental annexes, which may be classified or unclassified, to the strategy offering additional views on illicit finance risks posed by digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, CBDCs and trends in the use of digital assets by illicit actors.  (c) Within 120 days of submission to the Congress of the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the attorney general, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the director of National Intelligence and the heads of other relevant agencies shall develop a coordinated action plan based on the strategy’s conclusions for mitigating the digital‑asset-related illicit finance and national security risks addressed in the updated strategy. This action plan shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. The action plan shall address the role of law enforcement and measures to increase financial services providers’ compliance with AML/CFT obligations related to digital asset activities.  (d) Within 120 days following completion of all of the following reports – the National Money Laundering Risk Assessment; the National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment; the National Proliferation Financing Risk Assessment; and the updated National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing – the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the relevant agencies through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order on any pending, proposed or prospective rulemakings to address digital asset illicit finance risks. The Secretary of the Treasury shall consult with and consider the perspectives of relevant agencies in evaluating opportunities to mitigate such risks through regulation.  Sec. 8. Policy and Actions Related to Fostering International Cooperation and United States Competitiveness.  (a) The policy of my administration on fostering international cooperation and United States competitiveness with respect to digital assets and financial innovation is as follows: (i) Technology-driven financial innovation is frequently cross-border and therefore requires international cooperation among public authorities. This cooperation is critical to maintaining high regulatory standards and a level playing field. Uneven regulation, supervision and compliance across jurisdictions creates opportunities for arbitrage and raises risks to financial stability and the protection of consumers, investors, businesses and markets. Inadequate AML/CFT regulation, supervision and enforcement by other countries challenges the ability of the United States to investigate illicit digital asset transaction flows that frequently jump overseas, as is often the case in ransomware payments and other cybercrime-related money laundering. There must also be cooperation to reduce inefficiencies in international funds transfer and payment systems. (ii) The United States government has been active in international fora and through bilateral partnerships on many of these issues and has a robust agenda to continue this work in the coming years. While the United States held the position of president of the FATF, the United States led the group in developing and adopting the first international standards on digital assets. The United States must continue to work with international partners on standards for the development and appropriate interoperability of digital payment architectures and CBDCs to reduce payment inefficiencies and ensure that any new funds transfer and payment systems are consistent with United States values and legal requirements. (iii) While the United States held the position of president of the 2020 G-7, the United States established the G-7 Digital Payments Experts Group to discuss CBDCs, stablecoins and other digital payment issues. The G-7 report outlining a set of policy principles for CBDCs is an important contribution to establishing guidelines for jurisdictions for the exploration and potential development of CBDCs. While a CBDC would be issued by a country’s central bank, the supporting infrastructure could involve both public and private participants. The G-7 report highlighted that any CBDC should be grounded in the G-7’s long-standing public commitments to transparency, the rule of law and sound economic governance, as well as the promotion of competition and innovation. (iv) The United States continues to support the G-20 road map for addressing challenges and frictions with cross-border funds transfers and payments for which work is underway, including work on improvements to existing systems for cross-border funds transfers and payments, the international dimensions of CBDC designs and the potential of well-regulated stablecoin arrangements. The international Financial Stability Board (FSB), together with standard-setting bodies, is leading work on issues related to stablecoins, cross‑border funds transfers and payments and other international dimensions of digital assets and payments, while FATF continues its leadership in setting AML/CFT standards for digital assets. Such international work should continue to address the full spectrum of issues and challenges raised by digital assets, including financial stability, consumer, investor and business risks, and money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing, sanctions evasion and other illicit activities. (v) My administration will elevate the importance of these topics and expand engagement with our critical international partners, including through fora such as the G-7, G-20, FATF and FSB. My administration will support the ongoing international work and, where appropriate, push for additional work to drive development and implementation of holistic standards, cooperation and coordination and information sharing. With respect to digital assets, my administration will seek to ensure that our core democratic values are respected; consumers, investors and businesses are protected; appropriate global financial system connectivity and platform and architecture interoperability are preserved; and the safety and soundness of the global financial system and international monetary system are maintained.  (b) In furtherance of the policy stated in section 8 (a) of this order: (i) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall establish a framework for interagency international engagement with foreign counterparts and in international fora to, as appropriate, adapt, update and enhance adoption of global principles and standards for how digital assets are used and transacted, and to promote development of digital asset and CBDC technologies consistent with our values and legal requirements. This framework shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. This framework shall include specific and prioritized lines of effort and coordinated messaging; interagency engagement and activities with foreign partners, such as foreign assistance and capacity-building efforts and coordination of global compliance; and whole‑of‑government efforts to promote international principles, standards and best practices. This framework should reflect ongoing leadership by the Secretary of the Treasury and financial regulators in relevant international financial standards bodies and should elevate United States engagement on digital assets issues in technical standards bodies and other international fora to promote development of digital asset and CBDC technologies consistent with our values. (ii) Within one year of the date of the establishment of the framework required by section 8(b)(i) of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development and the heads of other relevant agencies as appropriate, shall submit a report to the president on priority actions taken under the framework and its effectiveness. This report shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. (iii) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury and the heads of other relevant agencies, shall establish a framework for enhancing United States economic competitiveness in, and leveraging of, digital asset technologies. This framework shall be coordinated through the interagency process described in section 3 of this order. (iv) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the attorney general, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit a report to the president on how to strengthen international law enforcement cooperation for detecting, investigating and prosecuting criminal activity related to digital assets.  Sec. 9. Definitions. For the purposes of this order:  (a) The term “blockchain” refers to distributed ledger technologies where data is shared across a network that creates a digital ledger of verified transactions or information among network participants and the data are typically linked using cryptography to maintain the integrity of the ledger and execute other functions, including transfer of ownership or value.  (b) The term “central bank digital currency” or “CBDC” refers to a form of digital money or monetary value, denominated in the national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central bank.  (c) The term “cryptocurrencies” refers to a digital asset, which may be a medium of exchange, for which generation or ownership records are supported through a distributed ledger technology that relies on cryptography, such as a blockchain.  (d) The term “digital assets” refers to all CBDCs, regardless of the technology used, and to other representations of value, financial assets and instruments, or claims that are used to make payments or investments, or to transmit or exchange funds or the equivalent thereof, that are issued or represented in digital form through the use of distributed ledger technology. For example, digital assets include cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and CBDCs. Regardless of the label used, a digital asset may be, among other things, a security, a commodity, a derivative or other financial product. Digital assets may be exchanged across digital asset trading platforms, including centralized and decentralized finance platforms or through peer-to-peer technologies.  (e) The term “stablecoins” refers to a category of cryptocurrencies with mechanisms that are aimed at maintaining a stable value, such as by pegging the value of the coin to a specific currency, asset, or pool of assets or by algorithmically controlling supply in response to changes in demand in order to stabilize value.  Sec. 10. General Provisions.  (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative or legislative proposals.  (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees or agents, or any other person.

42394537,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBWxN,1646841039,Custodial Wallets vs. Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets,"Custodial and non-custodial crypto wallets allow you to hold and transfer digital assets by connecting to and interacting with a particular blockchain network. For instance, a software wallet like MetaMask can be used to connect and interface with the Ethereum blockchain, whereas Solflare is specifically designed to connect to Solana’s blockchain.  There are two different types of crypto wallets:  Hardware wallets.  Software wallets.  It’s also important to note all crypto wallets consist of two important components:  A public key.  A private key.  Public and private crypto wallet keys  A public key is effectively the address of your crypto wallet. This is a public-facing data point like your home address and is used to receive inbound cryptocurrencies and encrypt outbound transaction data. When depositing crypto into a wallet, you simply input the public key as the deposit address. This is similar to using your handle in a service such as Venmo or CashApp.  A private key is like the key to your front door and is used to facilitate the transfer of cryptocurrencies out of a wallet and prove ownership over any funds held inside. Just like you wouldn’t want a stranger having your front door key, you don’t want anyone to possess your private key. This is because any outside person who gains access to a wallet’s private key can effectively take control of the assets inside the wallet and move the funds elsewhere. And unlike traditional finance, there’s no way of reversing the transaction without rolling back the blockchain – something that very rarely happens in the industry.  Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet: How to Use It and Why You Need One  The two keys are used together in order to send cryptocurrency from one wallet to another. In order to send coins through the blockchain network, a user must first enter the public key and then confirm the transaction by entering the private key. Upon correctly entering both the public and private key, the wallet then broadcasts the transaction to the network and the recipient’s public address is attached to the coins, completing the transfer.  Cryptocurrency is essentially a bearer asset, as the person who holds the private keys to a wallet effectively controls (owns) the coins inside.  So why is all this important? Well, understanding the difference between custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets means understanding who controls the private keys.  Custodial crypto wallets  Custodial wallets are wallet services offered by a centralized business such as a cryptocurrency exchange. Custodial wallets have certain benefits, such as less user responsibility regarding private key management. When a user outsources wallet custody to a business, they are essentially outsourcing their private keys to that institution. The individual user is not responsible for protecting the private key to the wallet and therefore places trust in the business keeping the private key safe.  When a user wishes to send coins out of a custodial wallet, they simply log in to the platform with a username and password, input the public key of the location to where they wish to send coins, and the business is responsible for inputting the private key to complete the transaction.  This creates an extremely simple solution for the user but also creates an additional layer of risk. There have been many exchanges that have been hacked, including Mt. Gox, QuadrigaCX, BTC-e and Bitstamp.  In recent days, with the development of the conflict in Ukraine, certain governments have prevented custodial wallets from completing transactions for citizens in certain areas. The Canadian government even recently attempted to freeze the assets of a group of supporters funding the Canadian trucker protest.  Non-custodial wallets  Non-custodial wallets do not have this problem. Non-custodial wallets do not require the outsourcing of trust to an institution, so no institution can refuse to complete transactions.  These transactions are essentially censorship-resistant, as the user controls the private key. However, non-custodial wallets are not as easy to use as custodial wallets. When using a non-custodial wallet, users must remember that if they lose the private key, the coins in the wallet are essentially lost forever. Misplacing private keys can be a costly mistake. Users must develop a set of practices to maximize security and protect private keys in order to enjoy the full benefits of a non-custodial wallet.  Read more: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  Non-custodial wallets are a great way to ensure user assets are not subject to censorship or confiscation, however, in exchange for this freedom, a tremendous amount of responsibility is placed on the holder of the private keys.  Ultimately, there is no right or wrong way to store your assets. In crypto, there’s a popular saying, “not your keys, not your crypto.” This is true, as the holder of private keys essentially controls the coins in a wallet, but not all people are afraid of trusting an institution with private key management, nor do they fear censorship.

42411516,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOT01,1646840377,America's Quiet Default,"Amid the dying embers of World War II, in an ornate ballroom in a New Hampshire resort in July 1944, America gathered the imminent victors of the war and designed a new monetary system. Global currencies would be various weights of the dollar, redeemable for gold held with the U.S.  At the time, a British economist spoke up, and suggested instead a neutral international settlement medium consisting of a basket of sovereign currencies. This “Bancor” idea proposed by a certain John Maynard Keynes was overruled by the American delegation, which favored the more U.S.-centric dollar-gold standard. From 1944 to 1971, sovereign currencies were simply different weights of the dollar, redeemable (albeit infrequently) by the governments themselves for actual gold at a rate of $35 dollars an ounce.  The tether was tenuous, however. The entire system depended on the beneficence of the U.S. government and its willingness to not overspend, increasing the ratio of dollars to underlying gold. Things came to a head when the U.S. spent extravagantly on President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society and the Vietnam War, and sovereigns began to doubt the veracity of America’s promise to redeem currency for gold on demand. In August 1971, France called America’s bluff and dispatched a battleship to retrieve their gold.  Read more: Nic Carter - Bitcoin Mining Is Reshaping the Energy Sector and No One Is Talking About It  President Richard Nixon knew the U.S. could not honor its commitments and defaulted on the promise that had held since 1944: The U.S. would no longer honor the peg. A decade of ruinous inflation followed, and the U.S. was only able to stabilize the dollar through enormous rate hikes, in combination with the inventive petro-dollar scheme. This latter device saw the U.S. ally with the oil producers like the Saudis, guaranteeing them military protection in exchange for the exclusive pricing of oil in dollars, combined with the recycling of profits into U.S. Treasurys. With a reliable Treasury bid secured, faith in the dollar that was lost in Nixon’s default was restored.  Other tools facilitated the reentrenchment of the dollar in overseas commerce. The U.S. funneled its cheap debt into military spending and became the de facto guarantor of markets globally, ensuring energy and food security for the globe by protecting trade routes with its blue water navy. The U.S. set the rules of the game through their control of the international financial institutions – the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for short-term lending to sovereigns and the World Bank for long-term development finance. The U.S. maintained an open capital account and allowed their securities markets to become a global piggy bank for savers worldwide.  Today, the size of publicly traded securities in the U.S. relative to public markets worldwide vastly outweighs its share of global gross domestic product (GDP). U.S. dollars denominate most international trade, even for exchanges occurring outside the country. U.S. Treasurys came to be considered the global risk-free savings device for sovereigns, as the U.S. was presumed to have no default risk whatsoever. The Federal Reserve became the lender of last resort for central banks, willing to create unlimited liquidity to support markets worldwide during times of stress.  Even absent the tether to gold, the U.S. dollar thrived as the dominant medium of settlement internationally, and U.S. Treasurys served as the default savings device globally. Around 2014, however, something began to turn. Foreign government purchases of U.S. debt began to stagnate. Even though foreign purchases of Treasurys eventually picked up in absolute terms in 2018, they didn’t remotely keep up with the expanding scale of the U.S. debt.  While seizing Afghan or Russian reserves may feel righteous and just, the immediate effect of such actions is to completely undermine the credibility of dollar debt as an international savings device.  In short, foreigners, who had long supported America’s largesse by eagerly buying its debt, were buying less and less of our new debt issuance. Foreign ownership of U.S. debt declined from 34% in 2015 to 24% at the end of 2021. China’s ownership declined from $1.25 trillion in 2015 to under $1.1 trillion in 2021. To compensate for this diminishing outside interest, the U.S. looked inward for new creditors. The Federal Reserve held around 4% of U.S. debt in 2009; that figure has climbed to 19% today.  These purchases, made with dollars summoned out of thin air, come with a giant asterisk – they do not derive from organic demand for our debt. They are only sustainable as long as inflation is tolerably low, which it no longer is (in February, it hit a 40-year high of 7.5%).  The exact explanation for the lost appetite among foreigners for U.S. dollars and U.S. debt is hard to pin down. It may have been a delayed reaction from the 2008 crisis, when the Fed made it clear it had the ability to print unlimited dollars to support domestic markets (at the expense of foreigners). It might have been the aggressive sanctions the U.S. instituted against Russian banks after Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 – the most economically powerful nation the U.S. had ever targeted in such a manner.  Previously, sanctions had been reserved for small, economically unimportant nations. At the time, the U.S. threatened to exclude Russia from the SWIFT international transfer system entirely but backed down due to the severity of the measure. Russia took the threat to heart, and its central bank divested most of its U.S. Treasury exposure and set up a SWIFT alternative called SPFS.  Even as the Russians took steps to free themselves from dependence on the dollar system, the U.S. wisely walked back from the brink, realizing that American and European banks were hopelessly intertwined with Russian ones. At the time, President Obama laid out a prescient warning regarding the risk to the dollar system that arbitrary exclusions could pose. In 2015, he cautioned, in the context of unilateral Iran sanctions:  We cannot dictate the foreign, economic and energy policies of every major power in the world. […] We’d have to cut off countries like China from the American financial system. And since they happen to be major purchasers of our debt, such actions could trigger severe disruptions in our own economy and, by the way, raise questions internationally about the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency.  Joe Biden did not heed the warning of his former boss. First, the U.S. seized Afghan central bank assets held in New York and bizarrely handed a large portion over to the plaintiffs in a 9/11 lawsuit. While the seizure may have been predictable, expropriating the savings of ordinary Afghans and distributing them to Americans affected by 9/11, an attack perpetrated by Saudis, is deeply unusual. Partly as a consequence, the Afghan banking system is keeling over, worsening a humanitarian crisis.  Not content with that, Biden then dropped a financial nuke on Russia with the seizure of her reserves.  It’s important to untangle the perceived morality of this action – a reaction to an unjust invasion – and its prudence. While seizing Afghan or Russian reserves may feel righteous and just, the immediate effect of such actions is to completely undermine the credibility of dollar debt as an international savings device. The U.S. wants to have its cake and eat it, too: We need foreigners to buy our debt, so the government can finance its structurally high levels of spending. But we increasingly seek to impose moral conditions on who can hold that debt. The U.S. will find that their creditors are increasingly unwilling to pass these purity tests and will choose to hold a money that doesn’t require the owner to comport with Washington’s latest political fashions.  Author Luke Gromen pulled no punches, asserting that the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) “completely discredited sovereign debt as an FX reserve, completely,” adding that “the multi-currency, multi-polar world was likely fully born on Wednesday night.” Fed blogger Joseph Wang called the freezes of FX reserves “financial WMDs,” adding that “foreign sovereigns must now diversify as a matter of national security, and some citizens must now diversify as a matter of self-preservation.”  Wang points out that India and China, both of whom voted “abstain” on the United Nations motion to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, maintain heavily FX-based sovereign reserves that they will now be eyeing uneasily. Russia made the fundamental miscalculation of not realizing all of their foreign fiat reserves were at risk; other nation-states falling afoul of the U.S. will not repeat that mistake.  Most notably, the celebrated Credit Suisse interest rate strategist Zoltan Pozsar declared an end to Bretton Woods II – the post-1971 pure fiat period based on the petrodollar and treasury recycling. “Bretton Woods II was built on inside money, and its foundations crumbled a week ago when the G7 seized Russia’s FX reserves,” he wrote.  Read more: Credit Suisse Strategist Says We're Witnessing Birth of a New World Monetary Order  While the reach of goldbugs and Fed critics might extend only to narrow echo chambers on Twitter, Pozsar’s words reverberate around the financial community. For once, the difference between gold and dollars is starkly clear. Outside of James Bond novels, gold cannot be immobilized at a distance. Dollars and dollar assets can.  While not as dramatic as the Nixon shock, the Biden sanction was just as genuine a default. U.S. Treasurys in the post-1971 era were the global risk-free asset, used by friends and enemies alike to reliably store value. Rug-pulling the Russians, even if warranted, introduced for the first time genuine doubt into the quality of the commitment the U.S. can maintain towards foreign creditors. The prospect of total asset invalidation is an unacceptable tail risk, and any nation-state wary of falling afoul of U.S. sensibilities, especially as the U.S. becomes ever more capricious and less interested in the well-being of the international sphere it used to govern, will consider diversifying out of U.S. Treasurys and other freezable assets.  In 2022, Pozsar’s “outside money” is king. For now, that’s gold, but even the former skeptic has some time for its digital analog, concluding: “Bitcoin (if it still exists [after the war]) will probably benefit from all this.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/09/americas-quiet-default,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Swim Protocol, a Solana-based protocol aiming to build the cross-chain bridge of the future, announced Wednesday it raised $4 million in a seed round led by Pantera Capital. Founded by alums of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, Swim proposes a streamlined system for moving stablecoins across chains, using liquidity pools and automated market makers (AMM) to make cross-chain swaps quicker and more convenient for end-users.  Swim’s technology is built atop Wormhole, the bridge that suffered a $320 million exploit in early February.  In addition to decreasing the number of steps required to send assets through Wormhole, Swim’s main improvement to the everyday user experience will be enabling native swaps.  Swim CEO Troy Tsui told CoinDesk that his inspiration to start Swim started during his days as a quantitative trader.  How it works  As with other bridges, when you send an asset like UST from Terra to Solana via Wormhole, the UST that you receive in Solana is not actually UST, but a kind of “wrapped” UST that is compatible with the second chain (Solana in this instance). Wormhole-wrapped UST should trade on Solana around the value of regular UST, but wrapped tokens have less liquidity than the real thing, and you’ll need to use a separate service like Saber to unwrap your assets in order to take advantage of most decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and protocols.  Swim’s AMM-based mechanics will eliminate the unwrapping step. Swim is also adding the ability for users to more easily monitor swaps between chains, theoretically making it easier for users to troubleshoot transfers that get stuck on their way between chains (something that happens more often than one might hope).  Read more: Jump Trading Backstops Wormhole’s $320M Exploit Loss  The Swim team cites security as a core focus. Wormhole suffered a major exploit in February, and while the funds were ultimately reimbursed by Jump Crypto (which has also invested in Swim Protocol), the incident highlighted the need for reliable cross-chain infrastructure and the challenges that come with building bridging solutions.

42411497,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSCQ,1646837100,How Crypto Companies Must Mesh With Traditional Financial Services Platforms for DeFi to Succeed,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) soared in 2021. The total value locked in DeFi protocols, measured as the aggregate amount of digital assets locked across all DeFi smart contracts, grew roughly 13 times in the year, reaching an all-time-high of $260 billion.  But virtually all that activity supported digital asset price speculation rather than real-world use cases. If DeFi is to realize the promise of better financial services, crypto companies building on top of DeFi must first connect to the traditional financial system.  In other words, crypto companies themselves will determine DeFi’s future, and most are not yet ready to play.  There are many reasons to want DeFi to win. DeFi could increase global access to financial services, enabling users to lend, borrow and exchange assets quickly through automated protocols without much of the burdensome intermediation of the current financial system. And DeFi may offer better investment returns than traditional finance. To date, yields across DeFi protocols have greatly outperformed yields from regulated depository institutions and treasuries (although one might expect yields to converge over time as the risks inherent in those protocols lessen).  But DeFi will lose in a vacuum. Although certain layers of the DeFi tech stack (like settlement, asset and protocol layers) are decentralized, others must plug into the traditional financial system. Indeed, a growing number of crypto companies are building products that seek to connect DeFi and traditional finance, using the aptly coined “DeFi mullet” strategy – fintech in the front, DeFi in the back – to increase adoption with regular consumers.  These products require integration with activities reserved for traditional financial institutions, such as fiat on- and off-ramps, trust accounts, secured loans, retirement vehicles and access to certain payment systems, among others. To integrate, crypto companies must either engage with those institutions (e.g., banks, institutional investors, investment advisors, rating agencies, etc.) or subject themselves to direct regulation.  Crypto companies that choose to engage with traditional financial institutions will need to meet the institutions’ risk management and compliance expectations that are driven partly by the institutions’ regulatory obligations. This is no simple task. Regulated financial institutions will, to different degrees depending on the context of the engagement, expect their crypto partners to have:  Clear and comprehensive business plans explaining their products, customers and markets  Financial statements that demonstrate sustainable capacity to meet current and projected financial obligations  Strong management teams with solid reputations, relevant experience and clear visions for strategic success  Robust risk and compliance programs, along with supporting policies and procedures, likely including comprehensive:  undefined  Crypto companies building on top of DeFi that cannot meet these expectations are unlikely to survive. In contrast, those that invest now in experienced executives and strong risk management, compliance and security practices will score big dividends, both operationally and competitively.

42423683,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2e8lh,1646835045,Miami Nightclub E11EVEN Rolls Out Crypto Division and 'Captain's Club' NFTs,"Miami super club E11EVEN is doubling down on its Web 3 push with a new crypto-dedicated division of its brand called “E11EVEN Crypto,” created in partnership with blockchain firm Horizen Labs, .  The company announced Wednesday the new division’s first product is a soon-to-be-released non-fungible token (NFT) collection titled “11 Captain's Club” dropping in early April, with artwork inspired by the club’s iconic hat designs and a hefty 1 ETH (around $2,700) mint price.  Since its inception in 2014, the downtown nightclub has prided itself on innovative revenue streams, having created its own apparel company, vodka brand and even a real estate arm that’s partnered with crypto exchange FTX to complement the club’s operations.  Now the company is eyeing NFTs as its next opportunistic frontier, at a time when Miami has begun to embrace digital currencies in a bid to be the U.S. hotbed for crypto innovation and culture.  Read more: Miami’s Multiple Money Visions  CEO Michael Simkins first envisioned the crossover years ago, reaffirmed by its potential after E11EVEN began accepting cryptocurrency as a payment method in April 2021.  “We were the first major club to accept crypto as payment, and now we’ve processed over $5 million of it at the nightclub,” Simkins told CoinDesk in an interview. “We’ve always been a preferred entertainment establishment for people in the crypto community, both VCs, founders and investors. So we’ve been in the ecosystem by doing all these things, even before being a direct participant.”  (The publicly traded owner of the Miami area’s Tootsie’s Cabaret and Scarlett’s Cabaret recently followed suit in accepting bitcoin payments.)  E11EVEN’s first foray into digital collectibles came in December, when the club purchased Bored Ape #11 as its first NFT for 99 ETH (roughly $272,000).  While Simkins couldn’t confirm any Bored Ape events being hosted at the club in the near future, he did hint at an in-person get-together for holders of Captain Club NFTs around the time of the upcoming Bitcoin 2022 conference in April.  “We want to listen to the community to hear what utility they want us to offer, especially real-life utility,” Simkins said. “There will be real-life utility and it will be driven by the owners.”  New York-based Horizen Labs, tapped by the club for the project’s backend, raised $7 million in August in a funding round led by Kenetic Capital.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/09/miami-nightclub-e11even-rolls-out-crypto-division-and-captains-club-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d23fe14f989dfeaaa66e0f7c610503359b896d5-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423697,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2e95h,1646834400,EmpireDAO Is Building a WeWork for Web 3,"In a DAO landscape often headlined by promises of real-world acquisitions, EmpireDAO has announced what few in the space have yet to pull off – opening its doors.  The decentralized autonomous organization, founded by entrepreneur Mike Fraietta in October, aims to provide coworking space for companies and individuals building Web 3 projects. It opened its first physical location on Tuesday in New York City. (Note: EmpireDAO created a corporate entity to rent the building.)  The group has set up shop in lower Manhattan at 190 Bowery – a landmarked Beaux-Arts building built in 1898. Originally a Gilded Age bank, the site of a Supreme pop-up store is now home to another class of tastemakers: crypto entrepreneurs and nomads, many of whom have yet to experience “in-person” work at all, building out the much-hyped future of the internet.  EmpireDAO is the latest in a string of ventures seeking to bring Web 3 communities into real-world spaces, following in the footsteps of social clubs, non-fungible token (NFT) restaurants, a golf course (in which Fraietta was involved) and fast-food franchises.  Though crypto originated as an internet-native and often pseudonymous technology, the growing wave of “real life” Web 3 projects, Fraietta said, is indicative of a longing by crypto users for good old-fashioned human connection.  “I’ve spent my whole career pushing online work, digital work. I was like, ‘Guys, we don’t need to go to the office, maybe just two to three days a week,” Fraietta told CoinDesk during a tour of the building last month. “But I’ve been missing this dramatically. So many things come out of meeting in person.”  Former Brooklyn Nets pro basketball player Lance Thomas, one of EmpireDAO’s lead investors, shared Fraietta’s sentiment.  “People want the option to work remotely but they also crave community,” Thomas said.  The vibe of the project’s open house reaffirmed the sentiment, a scene where hundreds of young crypto enthusiasts scavenged through the building’s many rooms in between conversations about who’d already claimed what.  ‘Crypto-native’ coworking  Visitors to the 36,000-square-foot, six-floor coworking space will be able to rent “hotdesks” for individual use, with memberships being sold as NFTs priced comparably to WeWork (WE).  Fraietta isn’t picky about which cryptocurrencies will be used as payment.  “We’ll take anything that has liquidity,” Fraietta said.  What matters to him is that the coworking space remains completely crypto-native – from desk rental to snack and coffee purchases, which Fraietta said will be done through Solana Pay.  Read more: ‘Pay’ Product Looks to Boost Stablecoin Payments on Solana  DAOs and crypto companies will be able to lease their own rooms in the building. Fraietta told CoinDesk the DAO has received over 200 applications from groups looking to rent office space, including three major blockchain foundations, and is currently reviewing them to determine which organizations are the best fit.  According to Austin Federa, head of communications at Solana Labs, the Solana Foundation is one of those considering renting space from EmpireDAO, though he said no lease has been signed yet.  Fraietta sees the project as a proof-of-concept for EmpireDAO’s “work protocol,” which he believes could eventually be used as a back-end system for coworking spaces across the world. He told CoinDesk he and the other four core contributors to EmpireDAO have a lot of ideas for how to use the space, though many of the plans seem to still be up in the air.  Fraietta said the group is in talks with a music studio (“We think this will be the music hub of Web 3,” Fraietta said.), and has floated the idea of installing a golf simulator (sponsored by LinksDAO, naturally) where visitors can blow off steam.  There are also loose plans for an NFT gallery, a DAO-sponsored Peloton room, a series of educational courses for members and, for non-New Yorkers, a virtual reality environment where remote workers partake in the metaverse.  Web 3 in NYC  New York’s crypto industry is booming, and the opening of EmpireDAO is another feather in the cap for Mayor Eric Adams, who promised to make the city a crypto hub.  “Every day I meet someone who moved here from Silicon Valley,” Fraietta told CoinDesk. “It’s almost taboo to say they worked for a Web 2 company.”  Read more: NYC Mayoral Front Runner Eric Adams Says City Will Become ‘Center of Bitcoins’  According to Fraietta, the influx of developers has been “nonstop” and they’re looking to make connections with crypto companies and DAOs – that’s what he and his team are seeking to offer.  “This is the best time to be alive right now. This is the beginning of the future,” Thomas, the former Nets forward, added. “Why would you want to isolate yourself in the midst of so much innovation?”  Fran Velasquez contributed reporting.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | SOL | SPONSORED,"Cheyenne Ligon, Eli Tan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/09/empiredao-is-building-a-wework-for-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d306072bbcd2391524945593087a3b89c9a937bf-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin keeps early gains. Biden's crypto order didn't announce new regulations for the industry. Privacy coins rally.  Featured stories: U.S. 10-year breakeven inflation rate hits record high, offering positive cues to bitcoin's price. Whales liquidate their holdings.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today’s show will feature guests:  Kristin Smith, executive director, Blockchain Association  Damanick Dantes, markets reporter, CoinDesk  John Sarson, CEO and founder, Sarson Funds  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated on overnight gains after U.S. President Joe Biden signed a crypto order early Wednesday directing federal agencies to coordinate their efforts to draft cryptocurrency regulations.  The executive order did not lay out specific positions the administration wants agencies to adopt or announce new regulations for the industry, CoinDesk's managing editor for global policy and regulation, Nikhilesh De, reported.  A senior administration official did a balancing act while talking to reporters, acknowledging potential opportunities for American innovation and competitiveness that digital assets could provide along with risks associated with the growth of the crypto sector.  Some analysts were worried the long-awaited crypto order would announce stricter regulations, given the recent speculation that wealthy Russians are using digital assets to circumvent sanctions imposed by the West.  However, those fears were put to rest late Tuesday after an unintentional release of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's remarks on Biden's then-impending crypto order said the administration would support ""reasonable innovation."" Bitcoin picked up a bid after CoinDesk reported Yellen's comments, rising more than 7% to $42,000.  While most cryptocurrencies followed suit, privacy coins like monero (XMR) and zcash (ZEC) backed off from Tuesday's high. Both coins surged over 25% on Tuesday, perhaps due to traders anticipating increased demand for privacy on fears of increased regulation.  ""My best guess of what's going on: With stronger oversight confirmed, segments of the market that value privacy (for ideological or illicit reasons) will rotate away from trackable crypto assets like BTC and [ether] ETH. Or at least this is what traders are speculating on,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the TagusCapital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.  ""Traders are thinking that other traders are thinking that oligarchs would buy privacy coins, so they buy privacy coins. But really, no one believes that oligarchs are buying,"" Solot added.

The 10-year breakeven rate, derived from the spread between conventional and inflation-adjusted Treasury yields, rose to a new record high of 2.785% on Tuesday, surpassing the previous peak reached in 2005, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  The above chart shows bitcoin has often moved in lockstep with the 10-year breakeven rate since the March 2020 crash.  ""Bitcoin’s 90-day correlation with the United Sates’ 10-year breakeven inflation rate, which reflects inflation expectations, moved higher from the second quarter [of 2021] onward,"" Babel Finance said in a 2021 crypto market review shared with CoinDesk early this week.  ""As an asset with the same durability, exchangeability and scarcity as gold, bitcoin began to partially replace gold as a trading instrument to hedge against inflation in the middle of the year,"" Babel Finance added.  Whale selling  Data tweeted by Blockware Solutions' William Clemente shows whales, or large investors, have been offloading coins over the past two weeks and the number of coins held by these wealthy investors has dropped to the lowest since September 2021.

42423691,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2e8th,1646833886,Owner of Bitstream Mining to List on Nasdaq,"The latest crypto miner to go public is U.S.-based Bitstream Mining, as its owner, Agora Digital Holdings, plans an initial public offering on the Nasdaq, according to a Wednesday IPO prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Agora will list under the ticker DEFY, with a pro forma total stockholders' equity of $53 million but has not announced the share price, the prospectus said. Agora booked a $3.3 million loss the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2021, according to the prospectus. The listing and ticker is still pending regulatory approval.  Agora has invested $7.2 million to set up operations for Bitstream, including buying 5,000 used Canaan AvalonMiner 841 mining rigs for $1.35 million, according to today's filing. About $2.4 million of that was a payment to a power management firm, including a downpayment to an energy supplier, said a September 2021 SEC filing. The firm has agreed to spend another $6 million to buy energy, order miners, and develop mining infrastructure, the prospectus said.  Starting November 2021, 550 of the AvalonMiners are in operation, the prospectus said. The firm expects to deploy Bitmain s19 Pro miners, currently one of the best on the market, through a third-party hosting service provider, Elite Mining, by the end of of Q2 2022, it said in the prospectus.  Ecoark Holdings (ZEST), which owns 90.1% of Agora shares, will hold on to 74% of Agora's equity after the listing, said the prospectus. Approximately three months following this public offering, Ecoark is expected to spin off 80% of its Agora stock it holds, 33,336,997 shares, to Ecoark’s security-holders as a stock dividend. After the stock dividend, 77% of Agora stock will be held by public shareholders, and the firm will act independently from Ecoark, according to the IPO prospectus.  Bitstream has signed a letter of intent with a power broker to obtain 12 megawatts (MW) of electricity in west Texas, and is expecting to buy another 48 MW in the next six to 12 months, according to the IPO prospectus. The firm has also signed a letter of intent for a 30 MW second site at an undisclosed location, and is negotiating definitive agreements for energy, the prospectus said.  Under its September 2021 hosting agreement, Elite Mining will supply the Bitmain s19 Pro miners, host the data centers, and operate the machines. Bitstream will replace the Bitmain s19 Pros with its own as soon as it can fund them, including possibly buying Elite Mining's rigs, said the agreement. Through the agreement, Bitstream would take advantage of 6MW of energy worth during a beta testing phase, set to last until mid-January 2022, said the September filing.

Chad DePue, a former senior director of engineering at Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., announced on Wednesday that he is joining Uniswap Labs as a vice president of engineering.  DePue has been working in tech since at least 1997, including with companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and the Whisper App. He is also a general partner at Uncommon Projects, a venture capital firm.  In a blog post, DePue cited “the endless opportunity that lies before us” in Web 3 as a motivating factor in joining the team.  “I’ve spent years building developer tools with innovators and creators and enjoy the challenge of bringing products from zero to one. Uniswap may be a household name for crypto-natives, but the broader culture is just getting to know us,” he wrote.  The hiring comes at a time when Uniswap is beginning to expand to chains and environments beyond Ethereum. Unlike SushiSwap, which has deployed to 15 different chains and layer 2 companion systems, Uniswap has only deployed to Optimism, Arbitrum and, as of December 2021, Polygon.

The team’s hiring page currently has openings for 17 positions, and has 53 employees listed on LinkedIn.

42410924,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtGs7,1646829000,The Promise of 'Stateless Ethereum',"Last week, crypto users in Venezuela and certain other jurisdictions were blocked from accessing MetaMask and, ultimately, the Ethereum blockchain.  The core issue ended up being with Infura, a crypto software and API provider that plays one of the largest roles in providing infrastructure for on-chain wallets and decentralized applications. While Infura said the ban was in accordance with legal standards and global sanctions and not a blanket ban, many noted that even the ability to block access poses a threat to the decentralization of the ecosystem.  So what are the potential solutions?  Industry-level change – use decentralized API providers, create hundreds of options that are geographically diversified  Protocol-level change – allow anyone to run a node on a simple computer and access the blockchain locally  The former is essential in addressing some of the concerns laid out by Moxie Marlinspike a few months ago and ultimately in pushing the industry forward to reaching actual decentralization. Marlinspike noted that unless users or applications are running their own node, they are completely relying on third parties like Infura and Alchemy to interact with the blockchain for them.  The latter is something that Vitalik Buterin has been discussing since 2017. The concept of “Stateless Ethereum” would help remove the reliance on centralized service providers and would allow blockchain users to access the chain locally in dire situations, especially if they are being blacklisted. To understand Stateless Ethereum, it is vital to understand the problem, as broken down by Ethereum researcher Sandra Johnson of ConsenSys:  “The Ethereum world state contains all Ethereum accounts, their balances, deployed smart contracts and associated storage. New accounts are continually being added and new smart contracts are being deployed. Therefore, by design, the state size of Ethereum keeps growing ad infinitum. The implication of this unbounded state growth is that it takes longer and uses more space to spin up a new full node.”  The Ethereum Foundation sums up some of the reasons to run an Ethereum node as follows:  As seen above, running a full node allows users to bypass third parties while interacting with Ethereum, but how could ordinary users spin up their own full node, especially as it will continue to become more memory and software intensive as Ethereum’s state grows? According to Ethereum developer Ben Edgington, you can fix this at the protocol level by making state storage somebody else’s problem. By introducing state providers, tasked with the core job of maintaining the history of Ethereum, you can also introduce stateless clients that make running an Ethereum node easier than ever, leading to true decentralization and resilience of the network.  This is all a very high-level overview of a concept that continues to evolve in real time. Ethereum’s Core Developers have been discussing implementation details, which will take place under the proof-of-stake network, hopefully in the coming few months. Stateless Ethereum is just one of the exciting upgrades that will become possible after the Merge, and 2022 is lining up to be one of the most exciting years in the network’s 6-year history.  And a programming note: Finally, I have to announce that this will be my last week at CoinDesk and my final edition of the Valid Points newsletter. I want to thank all of the readers who have followed along over the past few months and everyone at CoinDesk who helped make my job easy. I truly appreciate everyone who has reached out with feedback and helped me on my journey to understand the Ethereum ecosystem and community.  However, all you readers are in luck because Andrew Thurman and Sage Young will be taking over the newsletter starting next week! Andrew is top of the class in his knowledge and reporting around the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) industry and will do an amazing job following the progression of Ethereum. Sage started at CoinDesk as an intern just weeks ago and has already been a tremendous help with the newsletter, taking over the Validated Takes section and covering all data surrounding the validator. Valid Points is in good hands!  Signing off,  Teddy  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Frances Coppola, an ex-banker and financial author, posed the idea that stablecoin interest rates are so high because of the lack of central bank liquidity. BACKGROUND: While stablecoin interest rates in DeFi have fluctuated by a factor of 10 over the past two years, they have been consistent in beating returns on the dollar. Coppola assumed that a lack of liquidity injections and a lower level of rehypothecation have sustained this yield, but she failed to recognize the risk inherent in smart contracts and the incentives paid by DeFi protocols in the form of token equity.  A bug in Convex Finance’s staking contract unlocked staked tokens weeks ahead of schedule. BACKGROUND: By staking Convex’s CVX token for 16 weeks, users are able to participate in revenue sharing with the protocol. The mechanism has become very popular, with up to 72% of tokens staked as of just last week. The vulnerability forced Convex to mass unstake the locked tokens and the price immediately crashed 20% as the vesting schedule was thrown off course and a majority of supply became free to trade.  An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) was introduced to create a new transaction type for Ethereum staking withdrawals. BACKGROUND: EIP-4863 is just one of many proposals to get Ethereum ready for a liquid staking contract, but the proposal highlights the progress in making withdrawals a reality. The specific EIP will allow users to send the transaction out of the Beacon Chain without needing to pay a transaction fee on the receiving wallet.  Evmos to merge the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the Cosmos-based Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. BACKGROUND: Considered the port of entry from Ethereum to Cosmos, Evmos gives “Ethereum developers a frictionless way to build cross-chain applications,” said Federico Kunze Küller, co-founder of Evmos. Developers can port over implementations of protocols that are already running on Ethereum and make interchain transactions across the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystem. Evmos’ announcement signals the importance of interoperability between blockchains in the future of Web 3.  Factoid of the week  Open comms  Valid Points incorporates information and data about CoinDesk’s own Eth 2.0 validator in weekly analysis.

Gem is an application programming interface (API) company that offers fiat-to-crypto on-ramps and off-ramps, or bridges between fiat and digital assets. The company also offers a trade data aggregation service and a know your customer (KYC) product.  The Blockdaemon blockchain node infrastructure is intended to allow users to stake, scale and deploy nodes with institutional-grade security and monitoring. The platform supports more than 50 blockchain networks and is primarily used by exchanges, custodians, crypto platforms and financial institutions.  “We aim to provide the full node stack for institutions, which includes dedicated instances, high availability clusters, abstraction APIs, yield earning nodes via staking and liquidity.” Blockdaemon CEO Konstantin Richter told CoinDesk in an interview. “The other area that we think nodes should cover, and that are very relevant to our institutional customer base, are fiat on- and off-ramps.”  Crypto on-ramps are often “bad and poor products,” said Richter, but a good on-ramp offers a new source of transaction-based revenue.  The acquisition follows Blockdaemon’s $207 million Series C funding round earlier this year at a $3.25 billion valuation.  Blockdaemon will integrate Gem’s embeddable user interface (UI) flows and API that lets users purchase over 40 cryptocurrencies from 125 countries through the on-ramp services, which are used by the likes of decentralized finance platform Celsius and crypto management platform ShapeShift.  “[Gem] makes it very easy for people to take funds from anywhere and connect them and put them into another payment or yield earning platform, a little bit like Stripe,” Richter said, explaining why Blockdaemon made the acquisition. “It's ultimately transaction-based revenue for payments and on- and off-ramping of fiat.”  CORRECTION (March 9, 15:47 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Moon Pay as one of Gem's customers.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/09/blockdaemon-acquires-crypto-onramp-company-gem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9848e4fb26221c3f6ae86c96008d39d837520a16-1973x1315.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin jumped to over $42,400 before falling to $42,115 as traders took profits on the sudden move. Ether similarly moved to $2,762 a $20 drop. Ether previously reached $2,773 in early Asian hours, data show.  ""While volatility is currently rocking the digital assets as some buyers are currently taking profits, the certainty that more investors will invest in these leading assets, in the long run, is high, as they align with what Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen tagged 'responsible innovation.' With the plausible future buyup, we can expect BTC and ETH to breach new resistances in the near future,"" Greg Waisman, co-founder and COO of the global payment network Mercuryo, said.  The move followed the upward trend from early Asian hours when bitcoin jumped to over $42,484 from Tuesday’s lows of $38,100. An inadvertently published statement from Yellen said that presidential executive order on cryptocurrencies would ""support responsible innovation.”  ""This is most probably due some immediate speculation on the impact of the order. The approach of the order is more positive than some have expected. But nothing will happen immediately. It will take long time for the policies to be established (the order by itself does not introduce any policy). Therefore we can expect some ambiguity in regulation for foreseeable time. Sanctions on Russia do not help here as that is also introducing additional uncertainty in the [anti-money laundering] field,"" Vasja Zupan, president of Matrix Exchange, said.  Wednesday’s executive order, the first such to focus exclusively on the growing digital asset sector, directs federal agencies to better communicate their work in the digital asset sector without laying specific positions the administration wants agencies to adopt, as reported.  Crypto markets added 6.3% in the past 24 hours following reports of the executive order. Broader markets saw similar moves, America’s S&P 500 futures added 1.6% while Europe’s Stoxx 600 3.12% to extend Tuesday’s gains.  Bitcoin is up nearly 9% in the past 24 hours.

Taken together, the market capitalization of the top gold-backed coins – PAX gold (PAXG) and tether gold (XAUT) – rose above $1 billion early this week, marking a 60% increase on a year-to-date basis, according to data provided by Arcane Research. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has declined 17.8% to $1.80 trillion this year, per chart platform TradingView.  ""The rallying gold price seems to have attracted more crypto investors to the gold-backed tokens,"" Arcane Research said in a weekly note published on Tuesday, adding there are only two gold-backed tokens of considerable size: PAX gold and tether gold. One PAX gold and one tether gold represent one troy fine ounce of gold.  The precious metal has risen nearly 10% this year to trade above $2,000 per ounce. On Tuesday, prices narrowly missed the record high of $2,075 reached in August 2020.  The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has sent prices of all oil, wheat and other commodities skywards, stirring up fears of stagflation – supposedly a best-case scenario for store of value assets like gold and a worst-case scenario for risk assets. Stagflation is a combination of red hot inflation and stagnant economic growth.  ""Stagflation and gold are better bedfellows than anything you will read in '50 Shades of Grey,' and once gold comprehensively broke $2000.00 overnight, the rally accelerated sharply as expected. Gold rocketed 2.63% higher to $2,050 an ounce, edging slightly higher to $2,053 in Asia,"" Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific, Oanda, said. ""The stagflationary factors that are so supportive of gold are persisting and will remain so.  ""Stagflation is a serious risk and a higher and longer inflation is close to a certainty,"" Singapore's Monetary Authority said early on Wednesday, according to ForexLive.  While the crypto community considers bitcoin an inflation hedge, the top digital asset tends to move or less in tandem with high-beta stocks, perhaps because it is also an emerging technology sensitive to expectations of monetary tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks. The cryptocurrency is down 2% this year.  ""Bitcoin (BTC) has underperformed in this uncertain macro climate, but many investors still view it as an inflation hedge,"" Arcane Research noted.

42420993,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqgX,1646823600,Biden Issues Long-Awaited US Executive Order on Crypto,"The Takeaway  U.S. President Joe Biden signed a first-of-its-kind executive order on cryptocurrencies on Wednesday, directing federal agencies to coordinate their approach to the sector.  The executive order does not lay out specific positions the administration wants agencies to adopt, or impose new regulations on the sector.  One part of the order will direct the Treasury Department to create a report on the “future of money,” including how the current financial system might not meet consumer needs.  U.S. President Joe Biden directed federal agencies to coordinate their efforts at drafting cryptocurrency regulations in a first-of-its-kind executive order on Wednesday.  The “whole-of-government” effort to regulate the crypto industry focuses on consumer protection, financial stability, illicit uses, leadership in the global financial sector, financial inclusion and responsible innovation, according to a fact sheet accompanying the order.  The executive order, the first such to focus exclusively on the growing digital asset sector, directs federal agencies to better communicate their work in the digital asset sector, but it does not lay out specific positions the administration wants agencies to adopt.  Similarly, the order did not announce any new regulations for which cryptocurrency companies to abide.  A senior administration official struck a neutral tone on digital assets by telling reporters the growth of the cryptocurrency sector could threaten the U.S. financial system, national security or business stability. Without “sufficient oversight,” criminals can use cryptocurrencies to launder funds or evade sanctions.  “At the same time, however, digital assets can also provide opportunities for American innovation and competitiveness and promote financial inclusion,” the official said. “Innovation is central to America's story and our economy, generating jobs and opportunities, creating and building new industries, and sustaining our global competitive edge and leadership.”  Wednesday’s executive order, which was originally reported to be in the works in October 2021, will define six “key priorities” for the administration: protecting U.S. interests, protecting global financial stability, preventing illicit uses, promoting “responsible innovation,” financial inclusion and U.S. leadership, according to a fact sheet shared with reporters.  Roughly 40 million Americans, or 16% of the total U.S. population, have reportedly invested in or are trading in cryptocurrencies, according to the official.  Investor protection  Crypto’s volatility was cited as one issue that could harm investors by an administration official, who pointed out that bitcoin’s (BTC) price at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was around $10,300. The price peaked close to $70,000 in November before falling again in the fall of 2021 and start of 2022.  Bitcoin’s price surged more than $3,000 (close to 8%) on Tuesday after a Treasury Department statement on the executive order was seemingly inadvertently published.  “The President has put forward a holistic whole-of-government approach to understanding not only the macroeconomic risks, but also microeconomic, with the risk to each individual, investor and business that engages with these assets,” the official said.  Investor protection is then a chief goal, the official said. Part of this effort will include understanding the technology underpinning digital assets. Another part will include understanding the weaknesses in the current financial system and which areas do not currently serve all consumers.  “[The order] recognizes that our assessment of the risks and potential benefits of digital assets must include an understanding of how our financial system does and does not meet the current needs of consumers in a manner that is equitable, inclusive and efficient,” the official said.  Consumers might face an “antiquated payment infrastructure,” which would be slow or unserviceable. The official said this was “especially true” of cross-border payments.  ‘Future of money’  Part of the order directs the U.S. Treasury Department to draft a report on “the future of money and payment systems,” according to a fact sheet.  The interagency report will analyze cryptocurrencies’ impact on economic and financial growth, financial inclusion, national security and “the extent to which technological innovation may influence that future.” The report should also answer the earlier question of how the current financial system does or does not meet consumer needs.  In a statement originally published (and later removed) on Tuesday night, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the report will complement the Treasury Department’s existing efforts to analyze the cryptocurrency sector.  “Already, the Department has worked with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, the FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation], and OCC [the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] to study one particular kind of digital asset – stablecoins – and to make recommendations,” Yellen said. “Under the executive order, Treasury and interagency partners will build upon the recently published National Risk Assessments, which identify key illicit financing risks associated with digital assets.”  The President’s Working Group report, published in November, called on Congress to pass a law more clearly defining federal bank regulators’ oversight authority over stablecoins, but said the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) could take action in lieu of legislation.  Yellen referenced FSOC’s role in her statement, saying the financial stability watchdog would look at any potential risks posed by the cryptocurrency sector “and assess whether appropriate safeguards” already exist.  “Because the questions raised by digital assets often have important cross-border dimensions, we’ll work with our international partners to promote robust standards and a level playing field,” she said.  Another senior administration official said the executive order will organize these previous or ongoing efforts, bolstering Treasury’s efforts with input from national security and economic advisers at the White House.  Digital dollar  The executive order will also ask agencies to evaluate how the U.S. could issue a central bank digital currency, “should issuance be deemed in the national interest.”  In this, the order ties in to the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to study digital dollar issuance. Branches of the central bank have published multiple reports in recent months evaluating both the policy and technological questions that must be answered before a central bank digital currency (CBDC) can be issued.  More than 100 countries are already looking into CBDCs, the administration official said, with use cases encompassing both domestic transactions as well as international usage.  “Many of these countries are also working together to set standards for CBDC design and cross-border systems,” the official said. “With implications for domestic and international priorities, including the centrality of the U.S. dollar in the global financial system, the [executive order] will help make sure we have a leadership role and a seat at the table.”  The official said the U.S., when it held the Group of 7 presidency, established a digital payments experts group to evaluate CBDCs, as well as stablecoins and “other digital payments issues.”  Biden’s executive order will ask the Fed, as well as any other relevant agencies or departments within the federal government, to look at the possible risks of a CBDC in addition to the possible benefits.  Implications to national security, human rights and financial inclusion are other factors that these agencies will have to consider in answering the question of whether issuing a CBDC is in the national interest.  The privacy of the dollar remains a key issue.  National security, international cooperation  The executive order has long been rumored to have a focus on national security. The fact sheet detailing the order mentions national security a handful of times, while an administration official said the administration has already begun work on addressing these concerns.  The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) each have their own relatively young units focused on crimes committed with, or using, cryptocurrencies.  “The insufficiency of international implementation of anti-money laundering networks and frameworks with digital assets is the greatest vulnerability of these ecosystems that criminals are currently exploiting,” the official said.  Part of this stems from the fact that cryptocurrency networks were not designed with tools like identity screening or the ability to block transactions implemented, the official said.  Indeed, most cryptocurrency networks are arguably designed to limit identification and be more decentralized. To address this, the executive order “represents a continuation” of the U.S. working to set both financial and technological standards abroad, the official said.  “We remain committed to working with allies in the broader digital asset community to shape the future of digital assets systems in a manner that's inclusive, consistent with our democratic values and safeguard the integrity of the global financial system,” the official said.  The fact sheet described this as “promoting U.S. leadership in technology and economic competitiveness.”  The U.S. Commerce Department will be directed to create a framework to address these concerns, the fact sheet said, and to ensure that the U.S. remains a leader in using digital asset technologies.  Other agencies should be able to take advantage of this framework for their own policy or operational approaches to crypto.

42423694,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2e93h,1646823549,"Monero’s XMR, Zcash’s ZEC Jump as Privacy Coins Gain Favor","Tokens of the privacy-focused cryptocurrencies of Monero, Zcash and Secret were among the biggest gainers in the past 24 hours as the crypto market bounced from Tuesday’s support levels to add more than 6% to total market capitalization. The moves were among the largest for privacy tokens in recent months.  Monero’s XMR gained more than 25% in the past 24 hours, spiking as high as $277 on Binance before falling back to $196 at the time writing. Zcash’s ZEC and Secret’s SCRT increased 16% in the same period, reaching prices not seen since late January.  Price-chart analysis suggests XMR could fall to a support level at $180, while ZEC and SCRT could drop from their current $137 and $5 to $129 and $4.20, respectively.  Some analysts say masking a user’s wallet address and identity could play a role in increasing investor demand for privacy coins.  “With the quality of shielding the identity and details of transactions, many crypto users still believe privacy coins help enshrine the core tenets of blockchain transactions,” Alexander Mamasidikov, a co-founder of crypto bank MinePlex, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “The tokens have inherent qualities and use cases that many investors believe will also stir an increase in their demand across the board,” he said.  Monero and Zcash, unlike bitcoin or ether, use a cryptographic process to ensure that transactions cannot be linked to wallet holders and are untraceable.  Such an arrangement is helpful to some users in the current environment: Exchanges like Coinbase blocked over 25,000 crypto addresses linked to illicit activity on Sunday, as reported.  Crypto exchanges have been under pressure to monitor Russia-linked crypto activity, especially as the country faces sanctions from western countries following its invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions include blocking funding to Russian businesses and entities, as well as avoiding purchases of Russian products and commodities.  Demand for privacy cryptos  Privacy coins have seen declining interest from investors in recent years as narratives in crypto circles shifted away from privacy to decentralized finance (DeFi) – which uses smart contracts for the development of financial services – and non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Layer 1, or base, blockchains like Terra, Cosmos and Avalanche have been another investor favorite for the scalability, speed, and affordability they provide to users. Their tokens have been among the highest gaining cryptos in the past two years.  But the war in Ukraine and resultant sanctions might have pulled some of the focus back toward privacy coins, some say.  ""With some crypto exchanges announcing that they are blocking a large number of wallets many users that have normally nothing to hide or fear may still want to protect their assets,” Alexander Tkachenko, founder of VNX, said in a Telegram message. “During turbulent times safety assets like physical gold and privacy coins get large inflows of capital.”  Gold neared $2,000 on Wednesday, a level last seen in September 2020. The increase came amid a broader run in metals and commodities. Nickel jumped to $101,000 on Tuesday morning, while Brent oil touched nearly $140 a barrel.",POSITIVE,XMR | ZEC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | XMR | ZEC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/09/moneros-xmr-zcashs-zec-jump-as-privacy-coins-gain-favor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c041e3c2360bea5d78a6423ab4b734d9c3a74e50-3264x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

During the campaign, both major parties announced crypto policy in a bid to get young voters out to the polls.  The Democratic Party’s Lee Jae-myung pledged to use security token offerings as a way to create a dividend from real estate speculation distributed to the public.  In his official booklet of campaign pledges, Lee promised to ""issue tokenized securities to give ill-earned profits from real estate speculation back to the people"" and ""give citizens the opportunity to invest in large-scale state development projects.""  Lee vowed in January to establish a ""digital asset management and supervision agency,"" but this has since been toned down to ""a monitoring agency” of sorts.  Lee has also said he would consider bringing back initial coin offerings (ICO), which were banned in South Korea in 2017.

The EVM launch enables developers and decentralized applications, or dapps, from the Ethereum ecosystem to build and deploy on Kava. EVM refers to a virtual computer accessible anywhere in the world through participating Ethereum nodes.  Kava is built on Cosmos SDK – a framework for building public proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains – and aims to combine the Ethereum and Cosmos chains into a single network. This allows developers to build and deploy applications on a single chain that is accessible to users and assets of both Ethereum and Cosmos.  Over 15 protocols will be deployed to the closed testnet of the Ethereum Co-Chain as part of the Kava Pioneer Program, including yield farming protocol Beefy Finance, yield aggregator AutoFarm, and liquidity protocol RenVM. These projects will test the interoperability between Kava's Ethereum and Cosmos Co-Chains prior to their mainnet launch.  ""Ethereum is still where the vast majority of developers and protocols are, but Cosmos is growing fast and it offers so much more in terms of scalability and interoperability,” said Scott Stuart, CEO of Kava Labs, in a prepared statement.  Protocols launching on the Kava network will also be able to take advantage of its $750 million Kava Rise developer incentive program following the mainnet launch.  The Kava Rise fund launched in early March after community votes.

""A presidential executive order on cryptocurrencies would 'support responsible innovation' as it coordinates U.S. policy across agencies,"" Yellen said in the statement, which was accidentally published, and then unpublished, late Tuesday before being officially published Wednesday.  ""Under the executive order, Treasury will partner with interagency colleagues to produce a report on the future of money and payment systems,"" Yellen added.  Bitcoin (BTC) picked up a bid and rose nearly 7% to $41,900 after CoinDesk reported Yellen's comments, soothing market nerves. Other prominent cryptocurrencies including ETH, SOL, LUNA followed suit, according to CoinDesk data.  ""Based on remarks, crypto [executive order] is positive and calls for coordinated and comprehensive approach to digital asset policy that will support responsible innovation,"" Gemini Trust's Cameron Winklevoss tweeted.  ""I applaud this constructive approach to thoughtful crypto regulation and look forward to working together with the various stakeholders to ensure that the U.S. remains a leader in crypto,"" Winklevoss added.  The White House's long-awaited executive order directed at cryptocurrencies has recently attracted strong attention, thanks to speculation wealthy Russians could be using bitcoin and dollar-pegged stablecoins to bypass economic sanctions levied by the West. As such, several analysts have been worried the Biden administration would take a hard stance on the evolving crypto sector.  While Yellen's comments have revealed a balanced approach, concerns about crypto's use for illicit financing persist. ""The executive order will address risks related to illicit finance, protecting consumers and investors, and preventing threats to the financial system and broader economy,"" Yellen's now-deleted statement said.  The statement, dated March 9, was posted on the Treasury Department’s website on Tuesday night and was taken down shortly after it was published.

The exchange-traded fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in securities of crypto miners that generate or have the potential to earn at least 50% of their revenue from mining activities or related technologies. The fund will track the MVIS Digital Assets Mining Index and will a have net expense ratio of 0.5%  “Blockchains introduce transparency, efficiency and lower costs compared to traditional centralized databases and processes, but without miners, blockchain transactions cannot be verified and audited, making their role absolutely essential,” VanEck Head of Product Management Ed Lopez said in a statement on Wednesday.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  The ETF launch comes just a month after asset manager Valkyrie launched its Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), focusing on miners that primarily rely on renewable energy. That fund fell more than 10% since its inception on Feb. 8, roughly in line with declines in other miners and the price of bitcoin (BTC).  It’s a “compelling time” for VanEck to launch the fund, said Lopez, as the crypto mining sector is still in the early stages of growth, and he expects high levels of demand from investors for all types of digital assets.  The top holdings of the fund include miners, mining manufacturing companies, aspiring mining manufacturers and a blockchain-focused bank.  The largest weighting is Riot Blockchain (RIOT) at about 11%, followed by Hut 8 Mining (HUT) at 9.1%, Marathon Digital (MARA) at 8.3%, Iris Energy (IREN) at 7% and Canaan (CAN) at 6.5%. Rounding out the top 10 holdings are Hive Blockchain (HIVE) at 6.3%, Northern Data (NB2.GR) at 5.8%, Block (SQ) at 5.7%, Bitfarms (BITF) at 5.6%, and lender Silvergate Capital (SI) at 4.8%.

Jittery investors also awaited a long-awaited crypto executive order on Wednesday by U.S. President Joe Biden that will outline the country's approach to regulation.  Yet at the time of publication, bitcoin (BTC) was trading at about $38,600, up slightly over the previous 24 hours. Ether (ETH) was changing hands at a little under $2,600, a roughly 2.5% gain over the same period. Other major altcoins were a mixed bag.  ""Bitcoin is higher on the day as risk appetite showed signs of life after U.S. stocks had the worst rout in a few years,"" wrote Oanda Americas Senior Markets Analyst Edward Moya in an email.  Russia continued its campaign to isolate Ukraine's major Black Sea ports to the south and lay siege to its major cities, bombarding military and, increasingly, civilian targets. More than two million Ukrainians have fled their devastated country. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed to ""fight to the end, at sea, in the air,"" echoing Winston Churchill, Britain's prime minister during World War II, in an emotional video address.  The U.S., European and other countries, which have condemned the unprovoked invasion, continued to ratchet up economic pressure on Russia. Biden announced the U.S. would ban the importing of Russian oil. The price of Brent crude has soared to $130 a barrel, sending energy prices higher worldwide. The price of a gallon of gas in the U.S. reached an average $4.17 per gallon, an all-time high.  Meanwhile, a new round of major international brands, including McDonald's (MCD) and Coca-Cola (KO) said they were pausing operations in Russia. The latest events and the Biden Administration's expected crypto executive order contributed to investors' fears.  Moya noted that ""bitcoin’s fundamentals are still sound, but many active traders are putting the crypto trade on hold and focusing on a handful of commodity supercycle trades."" He added: ""Bitcoin is forming a trading range and over the next few weeks it could trade between the $35,000 and $45,000 trading range.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,170 -.7%  DJIA: 32,632 -.5%  Nasdaq: 12,795 -.2%  Gold: $2,052 +2.7%  Insights  What’s the Point of Singapore’s Digital Payment Token License if it's Too Hard to Get?  Three years ago Arthur Hayes (jokingly) bragged during a debate that his BitMEX crypto exchange was in Seychelles because regulators could be bribed with a coconut.  Hayes was trying to irritate his cantankerous debate opponent on stage while colorfully illustrating that there were alternative regulators to those in New York.  Nobody liked that comment, from regulators in the Seychellian capital to the U.S. Department of Justice, and the phrase eventually ended up quoted in the indictment against Hayes.  But in 2022 New York’s hardly the only regulatory body because other financial capitals vie to attract the crypto industry.  Singapore is often referred to as the next crypto hub in Asia, particularly because of its reputation for spotless governance and a strict rule of law.  Its strongman founder, Lee Kuan Yew, saw the nation’s path to prosperity as one of good governance and honesty. Unlike its neighbors, the government isn’t run by kleptocrats: Its civil servants are paid well for their competency, police don’t take bribes and the tap water is drinkable.  As much as Seychelles’ regulator might have honest intent and be run by sharp people, the perception of the country among some people is that it's the Third World.  So when Singapore’s Monetary Authority, its all-in-one regulator and central bank, started building a comprehensive crypto framework called the Digital Payment Token license, the industry was excited.  There’s no reason to keep ourselves parked in places with a less-than-stellar reputation, the industry thought. Let’s all move to Singapore.  From the Third World to First, but for the crypto era.  Since the doors opened for applications in early 2020, 180 firms applied for a DPT license. But 30 applications have been withdrawn, including Binance’s, and two were outright rejected.  That’s quite the sharp funnel, especially for a maturing asset class.  It’s 2022, not 2012. Crypto is young compared with other asset classes, but it has moved rapidly.  “Singapore’s standard is very high, and they will ask you to impose travel rules on your platform,” Patrick Chiu, the founder of Hong Kong’s AP Capital, a fund with a growing digital asset portfolio, told CoinDesk.  Travel rules involve strict anti-money laundering (AML) requirements on incoming and outgoing funds.  Chiu said the license terms have terms and stipulations that “aren’t typical for global exchanges.”  Everyone was welcome to apply, said Chiu. But there’s a tall regulatory wall.  So far only four firms have been approved for a DPT license with a fifth receiving approval-in-principle.  Included in the list is DBS (which counts Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund as its largest shareholder), which opened an accredited-investor-only trading desk in early 2021.  But absent are the usual stalwart names in crypto. Sure, there’s a lot to say about Binance dropping out given its baggage. But what about Coinbase (COIN)?  Chiu thinks the high license requirements may be deterring many of the usual names in crypto because of how unusual the requirements are for crypto.  For example, the license prefers face-to-face know your customer (KYC) vetting, Chiu said. Not really practical for many firms. There’s also the requirement that the crypto only stays within a network of whitelisted wallets within Singapore. Given the size of the market, this would no doubt hamper liquidity.  Bringing in foreign capital is possible, but because of the reporting requirements it’s just not realistic, especially for crypto traders that expect speed and liquidity that isn’t matched in any other asset class.  After all, DBS is only now planning to offer its small pool of crypto traders the ability to buy crypto online. Before, they needed to call in their orders. The bank is planning to offer a retail product by the end of this year at the earliest.  The question is, what kind of trader are these rules hoping to attract? It looks like a buy-and-HODL type.  As it stands there’s a pathway for people to buy and hold crypto under the licensing scheme, and that’s about it. Institutions might take an interest in this to add it to their balance sheet, but it's unlikely that professional traders or degens will be very interested.  By all accounts licensed decentralized finance (DeFi) is going to be impossible if the digital assets can’t leave the whitelisted wallets.  All of this sure sounds antithetical to crypto’s very fundamentals.  Sure, regulated crypto in Singapore will be as spotless as the country’s governance. But if the assets are stuck in Singapore, will anybody care?  Technician's take  Bitcoin Approaches $40K; Resistance at $43K-$45K  Bitcoin (BTC) has held support at $37,000 over the past few days, which could yield short-term upside targets toward the $40,000-$45,000 resistance zone. Support refers to the price level where a downtrend can be expected to pause because of a concentration of demand or buying interest.  The cryptocurrency recently traded around $38,700 and is up about 3% over the past 24 hours. A decisive break above $40,000 could encourage additional buying into the Asia trading day.  For now, narrow price zones could benefit short-term positioning among traders as most technical indicators are neutral.  A counter-trend exhaustion signal on the daily bitcoin chart, per the DeMARK indicators, appeared on Monday. That could point to short-term stabilization in price, although the previous signal on Dec. 29 did not result in a price bounce.  At times, when confirmed, reversal signals could be helpful for brief trades. For example, there was a technical set-up for a price reversal on Jan. 24, which preceded a 30% price rally. In a bear market, however, price swings tend to fade within the direction of the prevailing downtrend.  BTC will need to hold above $37,000 support and break through the $46,700 resistance level in order to signal a trend reversal.
