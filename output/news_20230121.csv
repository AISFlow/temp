7863152,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517019,1674345599,Solana Keeps Positive Radiance But Bears Could Dampen The Mood At This Level,"In recent times, the Solana price has witnessed a considerable upward push, which made the coin breach important resistance levels. Over the last 24 hours, SOL has rallied close to 20%, and in a week’s time, the altcoin has appreciated close to 40%. As Bitcoin’s price has remained above $20,000, most altcoins have shown positive price momentum on their respective charts. If Bitcoin continues to climb higher, then short-term bullish momentum will prevail across the market. Related Reading: Polkadot Could Present Buying Opportunity As Bullish Outlook Continues The technical outlook of Solana has pointed towards the bulls, but the chart also reveals that as the coin has been overbought, SOL would eventually witness a price correction. Accumulation remains high on the chart as demand for the coin has been at a multi-month high. Solana could present its buyers with buying opportunities; the coin might retrace on its chart and then rise again. The market capitalization of Solana increased, which meant that there had been an increase in buying strength. Currently, Solana has been trading at a 90% discount to its all-time high, which was secured in 2021. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was priced at $25 at the time of writing. Solana pierced through many resistance levels. The $25 price mark has acted as stiff resistance for the coin; it is imperative that SOL stay put above that region to avoid bullish momentum from fading. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $31, but before the altcoin gets to that level, SOL is bound to trade south. Local support for the coin stood at $21. The support region that ranges between $21 and $18 will present traders with entry opportunities. The amount of Solana traded in the last session increased and was green, which meant that the coin depicted bullish momentum. Technical Analysis SOL continued to display overbought tendencies, the asset was overvalued. Despite a tiny correction in demand, accumulation for the coin shot past the overbought region again. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was parked at the 70-mark, which was a sign that buyers exceeded sellers heavily on the daily chart. Similarly, the price of the asset was above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which meant that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Solana was also above the 50-SMA line (yellow), which is a sign of a bullish extension. On the flip side, SOL displayed a death cross where the 50-SMA crossed above the 20-SMA line, and that meant an incoming fall in price. Bulls were still around for Solana, but buy signals for the altcoin were declining in size. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) depicts price momentum and reversals. The MACD displayed decreasing green histograms, which meant that buy signals were declining on the chart.

7862864,https://newsbtc.com/?p=517030,1674344997,"Aptos (APT) Gains 55% In 24 Hours, Maintaining Its Bullish Form For The Year","The crypto market has been remarkably bullish since the turn of the new year. In the last three weeks, several assets have experienced price rallies, like Bitcoin, which gained over 37% to trade above $21,000 for the first time in two months. While that is an impressive feat, altcoins have been the real stars of the market, with many pulling off a stunning market performance. Aptos (APT), one of the trailblazing tokens of 2023, has just recorded a 54.73% gain in the last 24 hours based on data from CoinMarketCap. APT has been one of the best-performing coins in 2023, gaining by over 248% since the start of the year. Although it is a relatively new token, Its price growth in 2023 outshines that of many market giants, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) and, of course – Bitcoin (BTC). At the time of writing, Aptos (APT) is trading at a market price of $12.60. According to CoinMarketCap, the token’s daily trading volume has also gone up by 373.99%, attaining a value of $1.82 billion. APT trading $12.64 | Source: APTUSD Chart on Tradingview.com Related Reading: What Is SingularityNET And Why Is Its AGIX Token Exploding By 116%? What Is Behind APT’s Rise? Aptos was launched on October 22, 2023, making it one of the newest projects in the crypto space. On October 23, the APT token attained its ATH value of $10.25. However, APT began the new year trading at $3.43 due to the FTX crisis that occurred in November. That said, the dramatic rise in APT’s price so far can be attributed to many factors. One of which is growing support from various crypto projects. On January 6, PancakeSwap, the biggest DEX on the BNB Chain, announced its deployment on the Aptos blockchain following approval by its user community. The following week after this announcement, the price of APT surged by 97.6%, marking the beginning of APT’s price rally in 2023. During this period, Atomic Wallet, one of the top cold crypto wallets with over 3 million users, also announced they would be providing support for APT with immediate effect. Another contributing factor to APT’s impressive price rally is the constant buzz around the project due to its origins stemming from the now-defunct Meta Diem blockchain initiative. Moreover, Aptos is designed with many intriguing features, including its unique programming language – Move – that makes many investors consider it as a blockchain with massive potential to become a major competitor to Ethereum, Solana, and other established smart contract-compatible platforms. Related Reading: Polkadot Could Present Buying Opportunity As Bullish Outlook Continues What To Expect From Aptos In 2023 The Aptos blockchain is definitely one to look out for in 2023. According to the project’s roadmap, the major focus of the developer’s team will be the implementation of demand-driven gas costs in a bid to drastically reduce the current gas fees on the network. If successful, it is expected that such an upgrade could exert a positive effect on an APT token that is already soaring high in the clouds. However, it goes without saying that this is merely speculation and should not be relied upon in making investment decisions.

In the crypto mining space, several other factors contributed to the rally. Much like the relationship of gold mining companies to the price of gold, crypto mining companies are also leveraged to the price of Bitcoin. While the crypto rally is exciting for crypto investors, Bitcoin prices and crypto equity prices are still low on a long-term basis. Out of the entire ETF universe, the best performing ETFs YTD so far are crypto ETFs - more specifically, crypto miners following weak performance in late 2022. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) topped the list, increasing over 70% YTD as of January 18. The Vaneck Digital Assets Mining ETF ( DAM ) is currently in sixth place, returning over 57% YTD. Broader blockchain and crypto equity ETFs were also in the top 15, including the Vaneck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ), the Global X Blockchain ETF ( BKCH ), the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ), the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF ( IBLC ), and the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF ( SATO ). Just a couple of months ago, the FTX crash (discussed here ) was seen by some as the end of the crypto industry - which obviously was not the case. What happened to Bitcoin prices, crypto equities, and the crypto mining sector? This note explores why we're seeing a rally in 2023. Crypto prices were in the high $60,000 range in 4Q21 and have seen pressure throughout most of 2022, averaging just under $30,000 for the year. First of all, inflationary pressures and higher interest rates were causing investors to shy away from risky assets, including Bitcoin and anything growth or tech-related (including blockchain and crypto equities). This was worsened by several high-profile crypto events (e.g., Terra Luna, FTX). This year, however, investors are now somewhat more confident given weaker inflationary readings and a less aggressive Fed stance. Many investors are now more willing to consider taking risks again - including crypto. For many long-term crypto investors, the initial shock of the FTX bankruptcy has worn off after over two months with lower prices revitalizing interest in the space. In the crypto mining space, several other factors contributed to the rally. Much like the relationship of gold mining companies to the price of gold, crypto mining companies are also leveraged to the price of Bitcoin (see the formula below provided by Hut 8 Mining). If the price of Bitcoin increases, miners earn more profit. But if the price of Bitcoin decreases, then miners earn thinner profits - at a certain point, it may not even be profitable to run mining rigs. With Bitcoin under $20,000 for much of the end of 2022, along with rising energy prices, miners were making extremely thin margins. Both Core Scientific (CORZQ) and Argo Blockchain (ARBKF) announced that they would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, which added to the already negative sentiment in this space. Crypto mining ETFs like WGMI were down 83.5% in 2022 by the end of December (this ETF has an inception date of February 7, 2022). But in January, as positive news hit the broader economy, Bitcoin prices, and energy prices, things started to look up for miners. Argo Blockchain announced that it would receive a $100 million investment from Galaxy Digital and would avoid bankruptcy. Its stock price rebounded by over 470% since its low in mid-December. With Bitcoin prices still barely over $20,000, crypto miners aren't going to make the same profits they did when Bitcoin was $60,000, but this rally proves that the crypto mining industry isn't dead, and miners can still maintain profitability throughout weak markets. Annual mining profitability = (miner hash rate / network hash rate) x (price of BTC) x (block reward) x (blocks per year) LESS (price of miners) + (cost of electricity) + (corporate expenses) Bottom Line: While the crypto rally is exciting for crypto investors, Bitcoin prices and crypto equity prices are still low on a long-term basis. But this rally has created renewed interest in the space and has served as a good entry point for investors looking to get back or add to their crypto and growth allocation. Investors who want to invest in crypto equities may prefer to invest through an index-linked product like an ETF, which not only diversifies away single-stock risk, but also uses a rules-based methodology to eliminate more illiquid securities.

With Microsoft investing $10 billion on ChatGPT, we should expect AI applications to become more mainstream in the next few years. AGIX, the native token of the SingularityNET, is capitalizing on this as it tallied huge gains since the start of 2023. According to CoinGecko, the token is up 116% in the past week (at the time of writing, Friday) with the biggest gains made at the bi-weekly time frame at 360%. Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration What Is SingularityNET? SingularityNET is the first decentralized AI market that is built on top of the Cardano blockchain. The project was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel, a cognitive scientist and one of the leading figures in AI research. The project is set to create an AGI or an artificial general intelligence. Image: SingularityNET/Twitter As of writing, the SingularityNET ecosystem comprises 13 protocols that are either being built or are already deployed as a full-fledged component of the ecosystem. Getting Smarter By The Day On-chain developments have been very bullish for the SingularityNET ecosystem. According to the ecosystem’s recent blog post, the journey of SingularityNET in creating an AGI is getting closer by the day. The development of the MeTTa, a custom coding language specifically built for SingularityNET’s goals, have been successful so far. Image: Thoughtworks Arts The alpha release of the coding language will be accompanied by the release of the Distributed Atomspace (DAS) knowledge store this 2023. This technology would enable the AGI to store data for the long-term. These developments in the realm of AI will certainly make the creation of SingularityNET’s AGI easier. How Did These Affect AGIX? The ecosystem’s native token AGIX is currently one of the most bullish tokens on the market. As of Saturday, AGIX is trading at $0.2139, rising 32% in the last week, and facing rejection at two strong resistances at $0.2362 and $0.2546. The current rally of the token is unsustainable and bears might be able to retest its support $0.1404. This support is shaky as any breakthrough on this level might force AGIX to drop at $0.0822 in the medium term. AGIX/US Dollar trading at $0.2139 on the weekend chart | Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Decentraland (MANA) Swells 55% – Are Metaverse Tokens Back? But as time progresses, investors and traders should be able to observe how AGIX will react with the releases of crucial components of SingularityNET’s AGI development. However, Microsoft’s investment on ChatGPT development will further cement artificial intelligence technology in the mainstream, boosting the development of the AGI. With this in mind, investors and traders would have to sustain short term volatility and losses for possible medium term gains.

7823440,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516978,1674259237,Polkadot Could Present Buying Opportunity As Bullish Outlook Continues,"The Polkadot price has breached the $5 resistance mark in the past trading sessions. Over the last 24 hours, DOT has appreciated by 3.8%. The price of Bitcoin has been surging, which has caused other altcoins to also move upward on their respective charts. When Bitcoin crossed the $18,000 price mark, other altcoins broke past their immediate resistance marks. Polkadot price momentum remains bullish in the shorter time frame. The technical outlook for DOT showed that despite a price correction, accumulation on the chart increased. Related Reading: This Metric Suggests Bitcoin Could Be In Danger Of Another Selloff Polkadot demand also showed an increase on its chart. The asset’s price has to remain above the $5.40 support line and breach the $6.20 resistance level if the coin has to maintain a bullish stance for a longer time frame. The daily chart of DOT also points towards an incoming fall in price, which means that traders might be presented with shorting opportunities. Currently, DOT is trading at an 89% discount from its all-time high secured in 2021. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was exchanging hands at $5.89 at the time of writing. Polkadot had formed a cup and handle pattern, which means that the bullish momentum can continue, which is why Polkadot resumed its northbound journey on the daily chart. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $6. Toppling the $6 mark can take the coin to $6.20. As Polkadot was overbought, demand for the coin could trickle down. This can cause the price to fall for a few trading sessions before it starts to rise again. In case of a price retracement, DOT will encounter its local support at $5.40 and then at $5.33. These two levels can be an entry point for buyers, as the altcoin will rise in value after it touches these support lines. The amount of Polkadot traded in the last session was still green, indicating that buying pressure remained. Technical Analysis The asset had secured a multi-month high in registering demand in the past week. The coin was overvalued a week ago, and as a result, demand has retraced slightly. The Relative Strength Index fell back from the 80 mark, which was a sign of the asset being overbought. At press time, DOT again registered an uptick, indicating that buying strength was building again. On that note, the price of DOT was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, hinting that buyers were driving price momentum in the market. The coin was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) line. Despite that, the 50-SMA line crossed above the 20-SMA line, which signified a death cross. A death cross means an incoming fall in value. This reading corresponds to traders finding the chance to short the asset. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which depicts price momentum and reversals, showed declining buy signals. This means that the price will fall over the next trading session.

Overall, the bulls could continue to dominate the price action in the shorter time frame.
