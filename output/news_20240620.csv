29745103,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625696,1718924400,German Government’s Bitcoin Dump Surpasses $195M As Selling Spree Persists,"The German government has recently begun selling millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) from a confiscated wallet, further contributing to the lack of catalysts for a price recovery in the cryptocurrency market. The move comes as increased selling activity and unprecedented selling by long-term BTC whales have led to a sharp price correction, preventing Bitcoin from consolidating above $70,000 and retesting its previous all-time high. Whales And German Government Fuel Market Volatility According to blockchain analysis platform Arkham, the German government has initiated the process of selling Bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges. During Thursday’s morning trading session, $65 million worth of BTC was sent to two likely exchange deposits, including Coinbase. NewsBTC reported on Wednesday that the German Government moved $600 million worth of BTC, with $130 million sent to four likely exchange deposits, including Kraken and Bitstamp. Arkham’s records indicate that the German Government still holds $3.05 billion worth of BTC. Related Reading: Cardano And XRP Shorting Activity Could Act As ‘Rocket Fuel’ For A Rally; Santiment In late January, the German police seized the country’s largest cryptocurrency, confiscating 50,000 Bitcoin worth $2.17 billion. The seizure occurred after the suspects voluntarily transferred the BTC to official wallets provided by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). Moreover, recent on-chain data reveals that long-term BTC whales have sold a substantial $1.2 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past two weeks, further exacerbating the market downturn. Bitcoin Price Analysis In a recent social media post, technical analyst Mags, provided an insightful analysis of Bitcoin’s current price action, suggesting a potential mid-range breakdown. Mags highlights two possible scenarios for the market’s future direction: Scenario 1: Reclaim the mid-range: According to Mags, the recent pump on Thursday, which temporarily pushed the price above $66,000, has been completely retraced as BTC trades at $64,860, indicating a bearish retest on the daily chart. Scenario 2: Retesting the range low: Mags highlight an important support level near the range low of $60,500. This level holds significance in determining the potential future trajectory of BTC’s price. Bitcoin reclaims the mid-range level in this scenario, leading to a potential run back towards the range high. According to Mags’ analysis, if this scenario plays out, it may result in a breakout above the previous range high, suggesting a bullish trend continuation. Related Reading: 87% Of Bitcoin Hodlers Laughing All The Way To The Bank – Here’s Why Alternatively, BTC may retest the range low before moving higher. If this scenario unfolds, it could lead to a prolonged period of sideways movement, potentially prolonging the consolidation phase. However, even in this scenario, Mags maintains a bullish outlook as the overall higher time frame structure remains positive.

But even after dropping so much already, analysts do not believe that the worst is over. In particular, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has said that Bitcoin may still have a ways to go before the crash is over, prediction another 20% decline from here. Bitcoin Falls Below Major Pricing Band Crypto analyst Ali Martinez posted a new analysis on X (formerly Twitter) on the Bitcoin price that paints a rather bearish picture for the pioneer cryptocurrency. According to Martinez, the Bitcoin crash below $68,000 had actually pushed it below an important level. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Long Overdue For Bullish Wave, Here’s The Target The major level of importance here is the $67,890 pricing range, which the price has now fallen below. As Martinez explains, this area is important as the “+0.5σ MVRV pricing band” lies here. It also means that a crash below this level is very bearish for the price, and as Martinez shows, Bitcoin has already fallen below it. This fall puts a bearish motion in place as the crypto analyst believes it may trigger a correction. Now, while corrections are normal, the expectation for how far the crash will go is what is worrying because the analyst has placed a possible $54,930 target for the price. #Bitcoin has dropped below the +0.5σ MVRV pricing band at $67,890, which may trigger a correction toward the mean pricing band at $54,930. pic.twitter.com/zZvswgpUpS — Ali (@ali_charts) June 19, 2024 Such a crash would mean that the Bitcoin price would fall another 20% from its current level. Given the previous crashes, this could be devastating for altcoins, whose prices could fall another 50% if BTC were to crash below $55,000. Navigating The Drop In Interest One interesting development for Bitcoin is the drop in interest that has been experienced this week. For example, the daily trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap, fell 43.5% in the last day along. This brings the Bitcoin daily trading volume to around $19 billion from the almost $40 billion recorded the previous day. Related Reading: Cardano Bucks Bears As Large Transactions Climb To $10 Billion, Can This Drive Price To $1? This drop in trading volume indicates that investors are taking fewer positions. With the uncertainty surrounding the market, this comes as no surprise, given that investors are prone to wait for the situation to improve before taking more positions. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has also declined, showing that fear is growing in the market. It is now sitting at a score of 60, which shows greed, a long way from May’s score of 76, which showed extreme greed in the market. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is holding at $65,667, with a 0.77% gain in the last day.

The two had already been major donors for 2024 U.S. campaigns, each previously giving about $2.7 million, mostly to the industry's super PAC, Fairshake.  Portions of the contributions were reportedly refunded by the campaign fund to comply with legal limits on individual donors.  Gemini CEO Tyler and his twin brother Cameron Winklevoss, the company's president, have made two of the first major presidential contributions from prominent crypto executives, favoring former President Donald Trump with $1 million each in support, Tyler explained Thursday in a extensive posting on X.  ""Over the past few years, the Biden Administration has openly declared war against crypto,"" Winklevoss began in the lengthy case against President Joe Biden's administration. ""It has weaponized multiple government agencies to bully, harass, and sue the good actors in our industry in an effort to destroy it.""  Gemini was targeted last year in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case that accused the exchange of offering unregistered securities, which Tyler Winklevoss called at the time a ""manufactured parking ticket."" His explanation for supporting Trump was much more about opposing Biden.  ""President Donald J. Trump is the pro-Bitcoin, pro-crypto, and pro-business choice,"" he concluded.  Tyler Winklevoss said he used Trump's recently established willingness to take crypto contributions and gave his contribution in the form of 15.47 bitcoin, and his brother posted later that he'd done the same. The money went to the Trump 47 Committee Inc., according to a spokeswoman.  Part of each million was reportedly returned to the executives, though, to comply with donation limits, Bloomberg reported on Friday. Individuals are only allowed to give at a level less than $850,000 per individual for Trump 47, which is a ""joint fundraising committee"" that's organized to divide the amount to comply with legal limits for campaign contributions, meaning the money could be spread across a longer list of Republican benefactors. It's unclear what the brothers intended to do with the extra portions refunded to them.  Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have – all along – donated matching amounts to U.S. election efforts. It was already a large sum that placed them among the major individual contributors in the 2024 campaigns. Before today, the two had given a total of about $2.7 million each, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures. On the presidential level, they'd already backed most of the prominent contenders that had tried earlier to yank the Republican nomination out from under Trump: Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Gov. Ron Desantis.  The bulk of their donations, however, have been to the industry's main political action committee (PAC), Fairshake. Their combined $5 million represents a small but significant share of the Fairshake super PAC contributions that have now almost reached $169 million. That money has been devoted to buying outside ads for congressional candidates in the hope of loading Congress with crypto supporters.  The Winklevoss donations to Trump 47 join similar maxed-out contributions from Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder, chairman, and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, and his wife Kelly Lynn Loeffler, a former U.S. senator and CEO of Bakkt; Joe Ricketts, the founder and former CEO of TD Ameritrade; and Robert Bigelow, who owns Budget Suites of America and founded the now-defunct Bigelow Aerospace.  Updated (6/21/24, 19:50 UTC): The Trump campaign can only legally accept $844,600 per person. The Winklevoss brothers were each refunded the amount they donated above that limit, according to Bloomberg.  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

42408014,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8knd,1718918884,"California Judge Dismisses Part of Civil Lawsuit Against Ripple, Sends Rest of Securities Case to Trial","A civil lawsuit on a securities claim against Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse will proceed to trial in California.  A judge dismissed several other claims made in the lawsuit.  A California judge has ruled that a civil securities lawsuit against Ripple will proceed to trial, denying in part the crypto firm’s motion for summary judgment in a suit alleging that Ripple’s CEO violated state securities laws in 2017.  A jury will hear arguments on whether Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse made “misleading statements” in connection with the sale of securities in a 2017 televised interview. The other four claims in the class action securities lawsuit – the so-called “failure to register claims” – were tossed out on Thursday by Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  “We are pleased that the California court dismissed all class action claims. The one individual state law claim that survived will be dealt with at trial,” said Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty in an emailed statement.  The plaintiff has alleged that Garlinghouse violated California’s securities laws by professing to be “very, very long XRP” while simultaneously selling “millions of XRP on various cryptocurrency exchanges” throughout 2017.  According to court documents, Ripple’s lawyers argued that the claim should be tossed because XRP doesn’t meet the definition of a security under the Howey Test and “thus cannot give rise to a claim for misleading statements in connection with a security.”  In her Thursday ruling, Hamilton said that Ripple’s lawyers urged her to “follow the reasoning” of U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres who, in a parallel case in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), ruled that XRP did not meet all the prongs of the Howey Test when sold directly to retail participants on crypto exchanges.  Torres’ ruling constituted a partial victory for Ripple, and was celebrated by many in the crypto industry as a step in the right direction for long-awaited regulatory clarity, as well as a potential precedent for other crypto securities cases. But Torres’ ruling hasn’t seemed to have as much sway as hopefuls once thought it might. Last year, Torres’ colleague in the SDNY, District Judge Jed Rakoff, rejected her ruling in a separate case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Singaporean crypto firm Terraform Labs.  Hamilton, in her Thursday ruling, also broke with Torres’ legal opinion that that XRP sold to “programmatic” (meaning non-institutional) traders was not a security because those traders had no expectation of profits due to the efforts of others, one of the four prongs of the Howey Test.  “The court declines to find as a matter of law that a reasonable investor would have derived any expectation of profit from general cryptocurrency market trends, as opposed to Ripple’s efforts to facilitate XRP’s use in cross-border payments, among other things,” Hamilton wrote. “Accordingly, the [court] cannot find as a matter of law that Ripple’s conduct would not have led a reasonable investor to have an expectation of profit due to the efforts of others.”  In his statement, Alderoty added that Torres’ ruling in the SEC case “still stands.”  “Nothing here disturbs that decision,” Alderoty wrote.

29741897,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625636,1718917200,"Bitcoin Analyst Claims BTC Consolidation Will Continue, Hedge Funds Throw In The Towel","Bitcoin is trending lower at spot rates, sliding away from all-time highs. Looking at the performance in the daily chart, it looks like bears are stepping up, following the general inactivity in an overwhelmingly bearish trend. When writing, the coin is down 10% from March 2024 highs but steady. Will Bitcoin Consolidate For Two More Months? Taking to X, one analyst argued that the current state of affairs will likely continue in the days ahead. While most experts predicted Bitcoin prices to rebound sharply, even breaching all-time highs and race to $100,000 after the all-important Halving event on April 20, bears have had the upper hand. So far, the coin is stuck in a broad horizontal range with caps at around $74,000 on the upper end and $56,500, registered in May. Technically, the uptrend remains from a top-down preview following the welcomed push higher in Q1 2024. Related Reading: Double-Whammy For Ethereum: Price Collapses, Exchange Supply Dries Up However, even as traders expect more gains in the days ahead, the analyst said prices will likely stagnate in the next few trading weeks. When the network halved network rewards in 2020, the analyst notes that the coin moved sideways for 150 days, with prices capped between $9,000 and $11,000. Currently, the sideways consolidation, the analyst added, has been for 90 days, nearly halfway through the last cycle. If this guides, prices could continue moving sideways for the next two months, even dumping below the key support levels. Thus far, Bitcoin bear bars are banding along the lower BB, pointing to intense selling momentum. At the same time, the divergence between the middle and lower BB points to rising volatility, swinging in favor of sellers. Crypto Hedge Funds Reducing BTC Exposure As Whales Sell Via OTC Currently, macroeconomic factors and on-chain data paint a cause for concern. One analyst observed that more crypto hedge funds have reduced their BTC exposure, indicating a loss of confidence. Over the past 20 trading days, the analyst claims that crypto hedge funds have slashed their Bitcoin market exposure to 0.37, the lowest level since October 2020. Related Reading: Ethereum At A Crossroads: Big Move Coming After Consolidation Phase? While crypto hedge funds reduce exposure, another analyst said inflow to over-the-counter (OTC) desks has risen since Halving. This suggests that miners or big institutions are offloading BTC away from exchanges. On-chain data shows that OTC balances rose by 62,000 BTC, one of the largest 30-day recorded changes since 2017.

What This Means For BTC At the beginning of the year, miner reserves stood at approximately 1.87 million BTC but have yet to grow to about 1.81 million BTC today, a level not seen since 2010. This reserve decline is notable as it indicates a higher propensity for miners to sell off their holdings. Typically, this could lead to increased market supply and potential price depreciation, but the scenario has unfolded differently this year. Related Reading: Quiet Summer Ahead For Bitcoin, But Ethereum Holds Potential for Surprise — QCP Capital Despite the drop in miner-held BTC, the value of these reserves remains high, buoyed by a nearly 150% price increase since October last year, keeping the total dollar value of miner holdings near all-time highs at over $130 billion. Additionally, data from CryptoQuant indicates that Bitcoin miners’ over-the-counter (OTC) sales have peaked daily since March. Bitcoin In The Spotlight This miner activity comes amid broader market movements that have seen significant price fluctuations. BTC’s price has retreated by nearly 7% in the past day, dropping from a peak of $66,436 to around $65,269. The decrease aligns with a general volatility trend that has recently characterized the crypto market. Analyst Willy Woo commented on the situation, indicating that BTC might not see new highs until the current phase of miner capitulation and market boredom resolves, which historically precedes a significant rally. I know it sucks, but BTC is not going to break all time highs until more pain and boredom plays out. On the bright side, miners are capitulating and when that is through, it nearly always ends in a huge rally. Look for compressions in this ribbon.

42408011,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8kkK,1718911419,The Tide is Shifting: Cryptocurrency Regulations and Growth,"The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial. Authors' views and opinions are their own and not associated with CoinDesk Indices.  In a recent article you say “the tide is shifting” in Washington regarding bipartisan support for cryptocurrencies. What do you think is prompting this change in sentiment?  A recent poll by DCG said 20 percent of individuals in swing states believe cryptocurrency is important. Around the time that came out, former President Trump signaled for the first time that he was in favor of crypto, and soon after he started accepting cryptocurrency for his campaign. Right after that, famed investor Mark Cuban said to the Democrats, “Wake up, we’re going to lose this election if we don’t have more favorable cryptocurrency policies.” About 50 million people hold cryptocurrency in the US, it’s a very passionate demographic, and while you’re looking at the slimmest of margins heading into election season, it matters.  Next, we saw Congress vote to repeal SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 which is a very punitive measure that essentially restricts access to custody for crypto assets. Fast forward to FIT21, the first bill that would establish a regulatory regime for crypto, and also hopefully enhance customer protections, passed with 71 Democrats joining their Republican counterparts. What we’re seeing is bipartisan momentum; Nancy Pelosi even signed up for this bill.  Now, none of these bills or resolutions have gone into effect and become law, but you’re seeing a market and political sea change. Finally, we saw the SEC approve an spot ether ETF listing rule change which likely wouldn’t have been possible without this incredible policy shift, particularly among the Democrats. We’ve always talked about this generational divide, but now we’re seeing some of the more seasoned government officials on both sides stepping up and realizing that technology is not political. However, voting against technology innovation is un-American.  How could the introduction of a spot ether ETF affect the liquidity and volatility of ether in the broader cryptocurrency market, and what measures can be taken to mitigate potential negative impacts?  I think the impact of the spot ether ETF is going to be overwhelmingly positive because you’re going to attract a new generation of institutional investors who start to gain an appreciation of the value of the crypto industry in its entirety. Bitcoin is exciting because traditional minds and institutions understand this concept of limited supply and, essentially, digital gold. Next is a pivot to the Ethereum network and where they realize ETH has a stable supply as well. Ether also delivers utility because you need it for smart contracts to pay for gas. Then you realize, oh my gosh, it has this yield, which is very competitive – it’s between three and four percent when staked. When you look at it from a real yield perspective (adjusting for inflation), it outperforms its fiat counterparts in many cases – particularly in the US. And so, it’s a very accessible, exciting financial product for people who’ve not spent the time to study it.  I expect a new generation of people to get excited once they understand the nature of the technology. So, therein is an opportunity and a challenge. We do not expect the initial approval to allow the ETFs to stake their holdings, which will make it an imperfect product, but I do think we’re going to be able to offer yield via staking in the future. What it means for the ecosystem is that it’s overwhelmingly positive because people are going to say, “Wait a second, this ETF is correlated to spot price, but how do I get yield?” The desire for yield is going to bring a new generation of participants into the native staking ecosystem, which is a positive thing. Currently, about 30 percent of ETH is staked – it’s going to be interesting to see what happens in the ecosystem if that spot ETF scales materially because people are going to need to buy ETH on the market. If that ETF grows materially and you can’t stake it, there’s going to be a proportionate reduction in stake. Now I don’t think this is going to impact the network from a security perspective, not even close, but when you lower the staking, the rewards are shared by fewer. That could have the impact of making staking rates higher.  Has staking been growing in adoption, is it important that it does, and why would staking a benchmark be attractive to institutional investors?  Staking has been growing materially with the advent of liquid staking tokens. The issue we’ve seen in staking is that today it’s not so transparent. Effectively if you go to a staker and say, “What’s my price,” and they say, “Well, you get what I get and I take 10 percent,” that’s not institutional. What’s more institutional is saying, “Wait a second, what is the benchmark out there?” We developed a benchmark called CESR (composite ether staking rate), which we launched with CoinDesk Indices. Here, we look at the mean annualized returns across approximately a million eligible validators. We look at their returns over a 24-hour look back and we annualize it; that’s the baseline rate for staked ETH. And so, when you’re looking for a provider or a return, benchmark rates provide much better transparency of the performance you’re receiving versus some arbitrary rate. I think this makes it much more institutionally appealing. What we’ve seen is that most professional validators outperform the benchmark. This makes it good for validators themselves because they can price to that benchmark and outperform that benchmark. The benchmark determines how strong a yield you’re receiving as compared to the mean across the baseline rate.  How will the next wave of innovation in the digital asset market further bridge the gap between traditional TradFi and DeFi, and what new products or services would you like to see emerge from this integration?  Interest rate swaps, a $500 trillion market in TradFi, didn’t really exist in crypto before CESR. This brings utility to investors in many ways to hedge rates. This is an improvement over previously constructed traditional rates because it’s not closed – it’s open, transparent, observable and replicable. I believe a benchmark yield rate has the potential to unlock incredible utility by offering some of the same capabilities that we see across the $500 trillion interest rate derivative space. It’s that big for a reason. Swaps, structured products, ETPs – benchmarks are everywhere. If you turn on Bloomberg in the morning, in traditional news, they talk about the Federal Reserve and its rates outlook non-stop. Rates power the global economy.  For the first time, we have an exciting new rate that’s decentralized, open and very difficult to manipulate. I believe that benchmark rates like CESR have the opportunity to unlock an entire new class of financial products. We can extend this to other proof of stake tokens and see how their yield rates compare. But you really can’t scale these types of derivative products that are used for hedging or speculating without a foundational benchmark. That’s why we’re so excited.  What specific criteria and strategies does CoinFund use when evaluating potential investments in the Web3 space, and how do you identify projects with the most potential for long-term success and innovation?  CoinFund has been around for nine years. We have four core strategies:  CESR, which I spoke about earlier  Pre-seed and seed strategies where we invest in founders and protocols  A venture strategy that focuses on Series A and Series B  A liquid strategy that targets public liquid markets  Our investment criteria depend on the strategy. So, in the very early stages of pre-seed and seed, you’re looking to find the best founders in the world, and you want to make sure they’re building something special. As you move into Series A and Series B, you have a business model, and the business model is working. You are starting to have revenue. And so what we can do is work closely with founders differentiating our approach due to our crypto native expertise, our traditional markets expertise, and all the resourcing we bring to bear, whether it is people and recruiting resourcing, marketing, infrastructure, or regulatory support, and we get into the trenches and work with these founders.  If you look at our model, it’s really that we champion the leaders of the new internet and we want to be perceived as very strong partners that will help these businesses scale. The liquid strategy is looking at public markets and performance, and we also seek to actively risk-manage those assets. And then there’s CESR, our risk-based strategy, which is gaining global momentum.

This price recovery may be due to another significant investment round by business intelligence company MicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor. The company announced on Thursday the acquisition of an additional 11,931 BTC valued at approximately $786.0 million, further solidifying its position as a major institutional holder of the digital asset. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Surge To Nearly $15 Billion MicroStrategy’s Chairman and Co-founder, Michael Saylor, revealed the latest acquisition in a social media post. The company purchased 11,931 Bitcoin between April 27 and June 19, utilizing proceeds from convertible notes and excess cash at an average price of $65,883 per Bitcoin. Notably, the recent purchases increased MicroStrategy’s overall Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 226,331 BTC, acquired at a total cost of $8.3 billion, currently valued at approximately $14.9 billion. Related Reading: Solana Could Face A 41% Crash, Warns Mechanism Capital Co-Founder Saylor’s interest in Bitcoin dates back to 2020, when he began purchasing the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to holding cash. Since then, Bitcoin has experienced substantial growth, appreciating around 600% since Saylor’s initial investments. The recent purchase by MicroStrategy comes at a time when market sentiment towards Bitcoin is mixed. Market intelligence platform Santiment reports that the community is “mainly fearful” or disinterested as Bitcoin’s price hovers between $64,000 and $65,000. However, Santiment suggests that BTC trader fatigue, combined with whale accumulation exemplified by MicroStrategy’s latest acquisition, often leads to price bounces “that reward the patient,” as seen in the image above. BTC’s Cycle Top To Reach New Heights Despite the current mixed sentiment in the market, most experts and analysts are forecasting a cycle top for Bitcoin beyond the current all-time highs. Market analyst Crypto Con recently used Fibonacci retracements to forecast conservative and less conservative potential cycle top targets. According to Crypto Con’s analysis, the .618 Fibonacci retracement level has proven reliable for previous Bitcoin cycle tops. Extension levels can be derived by retracing from the cycle bottom to the top of the first move. The cycle tops of 2013 and 2017 were predicted at 4.618, while the 2021 top was forecasted at the 5.618 level. For the current cycle, the conservative target for the cycle top is $106,000, while the less conservative target stands at $161,000, according to Crypto Con. Related Reading: SEC Drama Fuels XRP Rally: Open Interest Skyrockets Adding to the positive sentiment, wealth management firm Bernstein has made bold predictions for Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Despite arguments from bears that the Bitcoin ETF trade is over and early allocations were driven by retail investors, Bernstein holds a different viewpoint. The firm emphasizes that Bitcoin ETFs are on the verge of approvals at major wirehouses and large private bank platforms in this year’s third or fourth quarter. These potential approvals and institutional interest act as a catalyst for adoption. Bernstein expects Bitcoin to reach a cycle high of approximately $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029, and an impressive $1 million by 2033. The firm asserts that institutional investors are evaluating “net long” positions, indicating a growing interest in the cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, BTC has limited its losses in the 7-day time frame to 3.6%, resulting in a current trading price of $65,170 for the largest cryptocurrency on the market.

However, amidst the prevailing bearish sentiment, there are glimmers of optimism for XRP and Cardano, fueled by recent market data analysis and insights from industry experts. Undervaluation Signals from Market Metrics Santiment, a prominent blockchain analytics The post Santiment Presents XRP and Cardano Bullish Metrics Amid Market Downturn appeared first on Times Tabloid - Latest Cryptocurrency News, Bitcoin (BTC) News, Ethereum (ETH) News, Shiba Inu (SHIB) News, Ripple's XRP News .",POSITIVE,SHIB | XRP,ADA | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,TimesTabloid,https://timestabloid.com/santiment-presents-xrp-and-cardano-bullish-metrics-amid-market-downturn/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png
29737418,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625672,1718904650,Cardano And XRP Shorting Activity Could Act As ‘Rocket Fuel’ For A Rally; Santiment,"On-chain analytics platform Santiment has outlined a factor that could contribute to Cardano (ADA) and XRP enjoying further moves to the upside. Both tokens recorded relief pumps following the recent decline in the crypto market, but market traders believe this development is far from a bullish reversal. Heavy Trader Shorting Could Lead To Price Rises For Cardano And XRP Santiment claimed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the heavy trader shorting which Cardano and XRP are currently seeing could be the “rocket fuel” for continued price rises for these crypto tokens. Santiment had also revealed that Cardano and XRP were among the most notable altcoins that are heavily shorted following their relief bounces. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Hit $10,000, ‘Just The Way The Chips Have Fallen,’ Analyst Says Interestingly, they called this a “good sign” for the patient bulls, as they believe that liquidation of these short positions could effectively be the momentum that these crypto tokens need to rise higher. Cardano and XRP being named among the most shorted altcoins isn’t surprising, considering that they are the most underperforming coins this year among the top 50 crypto tokens by market cap. Cardano and XRP have also usually failed to enjoy significant relief pumps even when Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market enjoy a massive rebound. However, this time could be different, as Cardano and XRP have enjoyed a modest price recovery while some other altcoins lag. Data from Coinglass shows that Santiment’s theory could already be in play, seeing how the Cardano and XRP bears have suffered significant losses in the last 24 hours. Over $50,000 in Cardano short positions have been liquidated during this period, while not a single cent in Cardano long positions have been liquidated. Similarly, over $30,000 in XRP short positions have been liquidated while XRP longs were unaffected. A Major Move Might Be On The Horizon For XRP Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently predicted that XRP could enjoy a price pump of around 1,700% starting in July. He alluded to XRP’s quarterly hammer formation between April and June 2016 and July and September 2017 before the crypto token enjoyed a major pump. The crypto analyst stated that XRP could form this bullish pattern again but needed to close the 3-month candle above the range between $0.55 and $0.58 in 10 days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment Drops To 2024 Lows, What Does This Mean For Price? Egrag further claimed that if the hammer formation is similar to the one in 2016, the XRP could begin the projected 1,700% price rally in July, eventually sending the crypto token to $8. However, if the hammer formation is similar to the one in 2017, Egrag mentioned that XRP holders might have to wait another six months before the “epic” pump of around 5,500%, sending XRP’s price to $27.

While FinCEN did cite four tokens -- bitcoin, ether, monero and tether -- the news of crypto's involvement in this illicit market has been well covered by previous criminal and sanctions actions from U.S. authorities.  Criminal organizations in Mexico have been using several popular digital assets to buy the raw materials needed to make the drug fentanyl, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which cited the use of bitcoin and other tokens in a Thursday advisory.  The cartels ""are increasingly purchasing fentanyl precursor chemicals and manufacturing equipment"" from China-based suppliers and paying in tokens including bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}}, monero {{XMR}}, and tether {{USDT}} ""among others,"" according to an updated FinCEN advisory to alert U.S. financial firms about the network of criminal organizations producing the dangerous narcotic.  The payments often end up in the Chinese suppliers' hosted wallets at crypto firms, sometimes through a secondary money transmitter, according to the notice.  The new warnings, updating a FinCEN advisory from 2019, reflect problems that had already emerged in sanctions and criminal cases brought by U.S. authorities.  In October, the U.S. Department of Justice charged eight China-tied companies with illegal drug production, distribution and sales of precursor chemicals.  U.S. overdoses involving fentanyl have become the leading killer for those aged 18-45. The chemicals used to manufacture the dangerous drug often come from China and wind their way across multiple borders on their path to U.S. users of the synthetic opioid, which the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says is 100 times more potent than morphine.

Events such as scandals, high-profile investors, and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs have contributed to Bitcoin's price surges. Cryptocurrencies remain a small asset class compared to traditional markets, with Bitcoin's market cap at over $1.275 trillion. EZBC is a spot Bitcoin ETF Product with the lowest expense ratio. Bitcoin began trading around 2010, and the leading cryptocurrency has experienced boom-and-bust price action for nearly a decade and a half. The ascent from five cents in 2010 to over $73,660 per token has been astounding. However, the ride higher has been more than bumpy as parabolic rallies have often led to shocking plunges, shaking the faith of even the most devoted crypto proponents. Meanwhile, events have caused the most extreme rallies and corrections. Scandals from the Mount Gox hack and bankruptcy to the FTX failure were responsible for significant declines. Futures on the CME, high-profile investors, and spot Bitcoin ETFs have increased the token's price to new highs. At over the $64,500 level on June 18, Bitcoin's market cap was over $1.275 trillion, representing nearly 55% of the cryptocurrency asset class's total $2.32 trillion market cap. Bitcoin was worth more than double the second-leading cryptocurrency, Ethereum. Moreover, only three cryptos, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether, had a total value of over $100 billion. At $2.32 trillion, cryptocurrencies remain a small asset class compared to stocks, bonds, currencies, and the leading commodity markets. However, the asset class and its leader continue to experience boom-and-bust price action, leading speculators and investors to flock to cryptos. Extreme price volatility creates a paradise of opportunities for nimble traders with their fingers on the pulse of markets. Cryptos offer substantial rewards for trend-followers and speculators, but the potential for significant profits always comes with commensurate risks. In 2024, the U.S. SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETF products, increasing the crypto's addressable market. The Franklin Bitcoin ETF ( EZBC ) is a spot Bitcoin ETF. While there are many choices in the spot Bitcoin arena and the ETFs that hold the leading crypto display identical performance, EZBC's expense ratio or management fee makes it one of the most attractive. Bitcoin - New high and a correction The monthly chart reflects Bitcoin's boom-and-bust price action over the past fourteen years. Long-Term Bitcoin Chart Since 2010 (Barchart) The chart shows the pattern of higher lows and higher highs in the volatile leading cryptocurrency. The latest March 2024 record high took Bitcoin to $73,662.76 per token. New highs have led to significant corrections, and Bitcoin tumbled 23% to a $56,668.48 low in May 2024. After the most recent correction reached at least a temporary bottom, Bitcoin has been consolidating. Six-Month Bitcoin Chart (Barchart) The six-month chart highlights the sideways trading pattern since the March high and the May low. An alternative currency in a changing world for foreign exchange Bitcoin is a means of exchange, a decentralized digital currency that market participants can buy, sell, and directly exchange with an intermediary, a function that banks serve in traditional currency markets. The U.S. dollar has been the world's reserve currency for decades, but times are changing. In early 2022, President Xi of China shook hands with President Putin of Russia, beginning a "" no-limits "" alliance. Less than one month later, Russian troops invaded Ukraine, launching a war that continues. China has stated its plans for reunification with Taiwan. Relations between the U.S. and Moscow/Beijing have deteriorated. Sanctions, tariffs, and other trade barriers have caused the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency to diminish. In 2024, Saudi Arabia ended a fifty-year petrodollar agreement and is now selling petroleum for payment in non-dollar currencies. The potential for a BRICS currency with gold backing is rising. The bottom line is the dollar's retreat in the global financial arena has supported alternative means of exchange. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies without borders or government intervention have gained acceptance. Bitcoin's rise has further sparked speculative and trend-following activities, with many investors allocating a percentage of portfolios to the cryptocurrency asset class. Bitcoin's role as a global foreign exchange transcending borders is one of the most attractive aspects of the leading crypto. Moreover, the technology that underpins Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other digital currencies has revolutionized bookkeeping and transaction times, changing the international finance landscape by bringing it into the modern technological era. The risk if the market cap grows to over $3 trillion At $2.32 trillion, cryptocurrencies remain a small asset class. The market caps of the leading U.S. stocks are higher than the entire digital currency asset class. Largest Companies by Market Cap (Source: Companies ranked by Market Cap - CompaniesMarketCap.com) The chart shows that NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) have market caps higher than the total cryptocurrency asset class. Moreover, those companies, along with Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), (GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), and Saudi Aramco, have market caps higher than Bitcoin, while the leading crypto's market cap is around the same level as Meta Platforms, Inc. (META). The bottom line is that cryptos remain small when compared to stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and other traditional asset classes. The high watermark in market cap for cryptos was just over the $3 trillion level, which could be a line in the sand for U.S. and other international legislators and regulators. As governments derive power from control of purse strings, if cryptos move to levels that push the market cap significantly over the $3 trillion level that threatens existing fiat currencies, we could see increased regulations and legislative efforts to curtail or even ban the cryptos. The higher they rise over the coming months and years, the greater the odds of intervention, which could cause significant volatility. EZBC - A spot Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin's latest rally occurred after the U.S. SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, increasing the cryptocurrency's addressable market. As investors, traders, and other market participants now have an alternative to holding cryptos in computer wallets and on digital currency exchanges, they have become more comfortable owning the assets. One of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs is the Franklin Bitcoin ETF ((EZBC)). EZBC's fund profile states: Fund Profile for the EZBC ETF Product (Seeking Alpha) EZBC's top holdings include: Top Holdings of the EZBC ETF Product (Seeking Alpha) As the chart shows, EZBC holds 100% of its assets under management in Bitcoin. At $37.55 per share, EZBC had $410.47 million in assets under management. EZBC trades an average of nearly 150,000 shares daily and charges a 0.19% management fee. Perhaps the most significant advantage for EZBC is the ETF's cost or expense ratio. At 0.19% it is below many of its peers : BTCW charges 0.25% . BRRR has a 0.25% management fee. BTCO's expense ratio is 0.25% . HODL charges 0.20% . BITB's management fee is 0.20% . IBIT charges 0.25% . GBTC's expense ratio is 1.50%. Since all the leading spot Bitcoin ETF products hold their assets in physical Bitcoin, EZBC's lowest expense ratio makes it attractive. A good track record of replicating the price action over the past months EZBC reached a $42.75 high on March 13, the day before Bitcoin rallied to its record $73,662.76 high. Bitcoin fell 23% to a $56,668.48 low on May 1. At the $64,640 level on June 18, Bitcoin was 14% higher than the May 1 bottom. Chart of the Price Action in the EZBC ETF Product (Barchart) EZBC fell 23.2% from $42.75 on March 14 to $32.81 on May 1 and rallied 14.4% to $37.55 on June 18 as the ETF did an excellent job tracking spot Bitcoin prices. One drawback is that Bitcoin trades around the clock, while EZBC is only available during U.S. stock market hours. EZBC can miss highs or lows when the stock market is not operating. Bitcoin is consolidating and awaiting the next event that could cause another boom-or-bust move. While it may only be a matter of time before Bitcoin reaches new heights, governments could be the most critical factor in leading the crypto's path of least resistance. Controlling the money supply is a power they will not easily surrender.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4700202-ezbc-bitcoin-consolidates?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29735979.jpeg

Over 87% of Bitcoin holders are in profit, with their investments valued higher than their initial purchase prices. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over $1 Billion In Bitcoin: Fire Sale Or Foreshadowing? On average, these investors are seeing unrealized gains of 120%, a significant figure that reflects the substantial rally that pushed Bitcoin to its all-time high in March, according to Glassnode data. However, despite these gains, the market exhibits both encouraging long-term trends and some short-term uncertainties that merit closer examination. Profitability And Market Metrics The profitability among Bitcoin investors is notable. The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) metric, a key indicator of market sentiment, remains comfortably above its yearly baseline. This metric measures the ratio of Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value and serves as a gauge of average unrealized profit across the market. A high MVRV ratio indicates that most investors are sitting on substantial unrealized gains, painting a positive picture of the market’s health. This upward trend contrasts with the recent price volatility, underscoring the resilience of long-term investors who bought the dip and are now seeing their foresight rewarded. Reduced Trading Activity And Demand Despite the overall profitability, the Bitcoin market is experiencing a notable reduction in trading activity. The vibrant speculative trading that once characterized the market has significantly diminished. Day traders, who previously capitalized on price swings, have retreated, resulting in reduced trading volumes and tepid demand. This lack of speculative trading has led to a stagnation in Bitcoin prices, which are now confined to a well-defined range. The market’s current state can be likened to a calm period after a storm, where activity is subdued, and prices sway gently without significant movement. Investor Caution And Market Sentiment The reduced trading activity reflects a broader sentiment of caution among investors. The current period of consolidation suggests that many investors are taking a wait-and-see approach, carefully assessing the market landscape before making any decisive moves. This cautious sentiment is further evidenced by on-chain data showing a significant decrease in the flow of Bitcoin into exchanges. Typically, an increase in Bitcoin transfers to exchanges is a precursor to selling activity, as holders look to liquidate their positions. The current decline in these transfers indicates that both short-term and long-term holders are refraining from selling, preferring to hold onto their assets. Related Reading: SEC Drama Fuels XRP Rally: Open Interest Skyrockets Short-term holders, who once actively traded Bitcoin for quick profits, are now transferring significantly fewer coins compared to the peak levels seen in March. This behavior suggests a shift towards a more conservative strategy, possibly in anticipation of future price movements.

42408019,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8l4A,1718899200,Crypto for Advisors: Crypto Trends,"2024 has been an active year for crypto investments. Connor Farley from Truvius breaks down institutional investment trends, interests, perceptions, and how they have evolved over recent years.  I’d like to welcome a new contributor, Marissa Kim from Abra Capital Management, who provides insights in the Ask an Expert section about supporting client’s investment interest in cryptocurrencies.  - Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Measuring Trends in Institutional Interest in Crypto  Since 2019, the crypto-focused subset of Fidelity’s institutional business has published a survey called the “Institutional Investor Digital Assets Study,” measuring trends in sentiment and adoption of crypto investing among institutional investors globally.  Overall,the 2023 survey depicts a generally sturdy but still mixed institutional outlook toward crypto on the back of a turbulent 2022.  Trends Reflecting Positive Sentiment  Half of high-net-worth investors maintained a positive perception of digital assets, and nearly a third have been invested in them for more than two years.  Positive perception and investment in digital assets are inversely correlated with age: 76% of institutional investors under 35 currently invest in digital assets compared to 18% of investors 65 and older.  Trends Reflecting Negative Sentiment  Overall familiarity, perception and investment in digital assets fell for the first time since the survey began in 2019.  Price volatility and regulatory concerns were the two largest obstacles to investing in digital assets, as reported by U.S. survey participants.  “Fraud/scandals” and “bad press/news” were the two biggest drivers of worsened views toward digital assets. The survey didn’t elaborate on these categories, but institutions likely have the FTX saga in mind.  It’s important to note the latest survey only spans May 30, 2023, to Oct. 6, 2023, missing a critical year-end period during which bitcoin rose from approximately $28,000 to $42,300, driven largely by anticipation of the SEC’s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs which occurred later, in January of 2024. Perceptions have likely evolved meaningfully since the start of 2024 following crypto’s market capitalization climbing above $2.5 trillion, Bitcoin surging to nearly $74,000, and the SEC’s approval of bitcoin and soon Ether spot ETFs.  What to look for in 2024  Arguably, the biggest market moments in the history of digital assets occurred after this survey was conducted, namely actions that reduce regulatory uncertainty, which may, in turn, reduce price volatility and improve investment options for investors.  Will the surprise SEC approval of spot Ether ETFs diminish regulatory concerns among institutions?  The digital asset market has begun transitioning from early adoption to mass adoption. A sea change in industry leadership, product development, and fiduciary commitment swept crypto in 2023 and early into 2024, enabling a new suite of increasingly institutional-grade on-ramps into the asset class. This change may take time to permeate through to institutional allocations more foundationally, but the rapid adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs following the SEC’s approval (aggregate ETF AUM doubled from approximately $30 billion in January to nearly $60 billion as of mid-June) may provide early indications of stronger institutional interest in crypto.  Will concerns about price volatility persist?  Volatility for the digital asset class remains elevated compared to other asset classes, but it has trended down over time and may continue to do so as improving regulatory conditions and institution-friendly product offerings potentially stabilize markets. Investors should also consider not just crypto volatility butthe risk-adjusted return profile of various blockchain assets.  Will institutional investments flow primarily into spot BTC and ETH ETFs, or will they be spread across investment structures (SMAs, private funds, VC) offering diversified exposure to blockchain assets beyond the two mega caps?  Supported by major advances in industry infrastructure in 2023 spanning custody, trading, and asset management, investors now have a better – but still nascent – array of product options and investment platforms to not only help avoid the pitfalls of early-adopter risk but also to exploit early-adopter premia. These options, in addition to ETFs, include the increasingly prevalent SMA direct-index vehicle.  With the combined surge in blockchain data providers and the growing presence of systematic digital asset managers, will institutions become more familiar with crypto fundamentals and methods of digital asset valuation?  Some 37% of 2023 respondents cited a “lack of fundamentals to gauge appropriate value” as a barrier to investing. This large number reflects the asset class's emerging nature and the learning curve associated with measuring blockchain value. However, this number is down from 44% in 2021. It may continue to fall as investors become increasingly familiar with blockchain technology and the unique ways to analyze a protocol’s value to users.  - Connor Farley, CEO,Truvius  Ask an Expert  Q: What else should I be thinking about aside from buying and holding Bitcoin?  A: If clients want exposure to digital assets, it’s advisable to diversify that exposure, as you would with traditional assets. Bitcoin should be the core of every portfolio. Still, consideration is increasingly being given to ETH and SOL, given that Ethereum is becoming the chain of choice for institutional applications and Solana is for consumer payment applications. Financial advisors should not leave their clients’ assets on exchanges but utilize secure custody solutions to retain ownership and access to their client’s assets.  Q: Should I get exposure through ETFs?  A: While ETFs are convenient for retail investors, they lack the flexibility and opportunities available from holding actual digital assets. Digital assets trade 24/7, unlike ETFs, which only trade during market hours. Moreover, ETFs do not enable yield generation, which can be an attractive income stream and cannot be used as collateral for borrowing. For clients with large BTC portfolios, borrowing against their digital assets may be preferable to selling and incurring capital gains tax.  Q. Which client demographic are digital assets most suitable for?  A: Understanding the suitability of digital assets requires assessing clients' risk tolerance and wealth management goals. For low-risk clients, digital assets may serve as a store of value, with opportunities to generate attractive yields through staking. High-risk clients may instead desire access to venture capital investments in early-stage blockchain projects or higher-yielding DeFi investment strategies. Tailoring these approaches to individual needs helps integrate digital assets into a comprehensive wealth management plan.  - Marissa Kim, head of Asset Management, Abra Capital Management  Keep Reading  U.S. SEC chair Gary Gensler stated that spot ETH ETFs should be available by September this year.  BNY Melon’s global family office survey showed that 39% of family offices hold cryptocurrency or are currently exploring it.

29732129,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625631,1718893835,"Cardano Bucks Bears As Large Transactions Climb To $10 Billion, Can This Drive Price To $1?","The Cardano decline in the past week seems to be coming to an end, as evidenced by on-chain data. While the overall crypto market has been in a slump, Cardano is starting to buck the trend. ADA, Cardano’s native token, has seen a huge surge in on-chain transactions from large holders, indicating sporadic activity and interest in the blockchain. Notably, transaction data shows that Cardano has registered over $10 billion worth of large transactions in the past 24 hours, representing a 26% increase within the time frame. Furthermore, this puts the worth of ADA large transactions at $32.54 billion in the past seven days. Cardano Large Transactions Climb To $10 Billion in 24 Hours Cardano, like most altcoins, has been going through a turbulent price action since the beginning of the month. This decline was further exacerbated by Bitcoin’s drop below $65,000 in the past 48 hours. However, Cardano now seems to be building bullish momentum, particularly from large holders. In the past 24 hours alone, 27.17 billion ADA, amounting to $10.43 billion, was traded between large holders, according to ITB. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Long Overdue For Bullish Wave, Here’s The Target Interestingly, the number of Cardano large transactions jumped to 851 in the past 24 hours, which is a 107% increase from 410 of such transactions recorded on June 16th. IntoTheBlock’s large transaction metric measures the number of transactions larger than $100,000 on the blockchain. It’s worth noting that while activity from this cohort has grown in the last 24 hours, it remains considerably below the transaction peak of 95,730 set on May 29. Can The Activity Push ADA To $1? With activity from large holders starting to increase, a natural question is whether this can translate to significant price appreciation for ADA. Many analysts think ADA still has plenty of room to run if the crypto market recovers and turns bullish again. Cardano, for one, now has its 30-day MVRV ratio at -12.6%, which is a very bullish indicator for a bounce in the short term. Related Reading: Dogecoin Weighted Sentiment Drops To 2024 Lows, What Does This Mean For Price? At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.3915 and is up by a meager 0.45% in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, recent price action shows ADA bouncing off a 7-month low of $0.3685 on June 18. The journey to $1 seems tough at the moment, and there are many price resistance levels to overcome. The first step is to push above the $0.400 resistance level. Failure to push above could lead to the start of another decline to $0.37. However, ADA reached an all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021, so reclaiming $1 is not yet out of the game.

The broker reiterated its buy rating and C$3 price target.  The sell-off in DeFi Technologies’ (DEFI) stock looks overdone, and the shares now offer an attractive buying opportunity, Wall Street broker Benchmark said in a research report on Thursday, reiterating its buy rating.  Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange-traded product issuer (ETP), plummeted in recent days following steep declines in altcoins and a negative opinion piece in a crypto newsletter.  Benchmark's analyst Mark Palmer wrote that the stock had gained more than 330% since the beginning of May; it then lost almost half of its value over two days before recovering much of that loss yesterday afternoon.  Most of the ETPs that DeFi offers are altcoin focused, and the slump in these tokens earlier in the week had a negative impact on the share price, Palmer said.  The pullback might be partially due to traders taking some profit off the table after the recent outsized rally, but the sell-off appears overdone, and the stock’s significant repricing offers an “attractive buying opportunity,” the report added.  Palmer reiterated his buy rating on the stock and a C$3 price target. The shares slipped as much as 17% in early trading on Thursday to around C$1.93 before rebounding near C$2, according to TradingView data.  “Volatility in the price of altcoins should not surprise anyone who has even a casual understanding of the dynamics of the crypto market,” Palmer wrote, adding that some weakness in the stock price due to the sell-off in these tokens was understandable.  DeFi has responded to the negative article published by CoinSnacks, describing it as a “misleading short and distort report,” the note added.

42408013,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8kdi,1718892153,Telegram Is Crypto’s Adoption Machine,"Listen to any crypto podcast or convention panel, and you will hear crypto natives speak of a killer app yet to come that will onboard the rest of the world. But what if it is already here? I argue that Telegram and a handful of independent developers have made more progress in onboarding the masses to crypto than the $100 billion in venture capital that has flooded the space since 2014.  Crypto adoption has been hindered by (i) poor UX, (ii) limited real-world utility, and (iii) terrible distribution. Through its support for and integration of The Open Network (TON), Telegram is addressing all of these issues and more.  From a Crypto Enthusiast’s Perspective  Throughout its early development and up until recently, crypto focused on niche tech development that primarily served crypto speculators and lacked real-world utility. With the arrival of spot ETFs and firms such as BlackRock opening up funds focused on asset tokenization, the time for evolution is now.  Telegram combined its messaging app boasting 800 million monthly active users, a blockchain providing rails for crypto adoption in TON, and a native wallet bot known simply as Wallet. Many crypto pitch decks vaguely romanticize the notion of “merging Web2 and Web3,” Telegram is actually doing it.  With this combination, Telegram addresses the three core issues that held crypto back. In my view, stablecoins are crypto’s greatest product to date. With native USDT on TON since April, the seamless transfer of value P2P became a reality. Users can send crypto to their friends as easily as sending a message on WhatsApp. This is a smoother UX than neobanks like Venmo or Revolut, and lightyears ahead of traditional banks.  The opportunity for onboarding 100s of millions to crypto, however, likely comes through Telegram’s Mini Apps — an open platform for businesses to build and deploy crypto-friendly apps. This will enable crypto teams to distribute their product to non-crypto-natives while the end user will not necessarily know they are using a crypto product — whether that is a fun mobile game or a DeFi protocol.  From a Crypto Native’s Perspective  Telegram solidified its place in crypto long ago. It is a popular platform among crypto natives used to keep in touch or share ideas, and it is usually the first social media channel new crypto projects set up along with their X account.  Recently, it became more than that for on-chain traders. A new generation of Telegram trading bots changed crypto UX forever, and perhaps changed on-chain trading forever. Buying/selling, setting limit orders, scanning new projects, sniping new launches, and copy trading “smart money,” all became simple with a single command.  Having a Telegram bot comprehensively freeing me from the most frustrating UX issues of on-chain trading was a breath of fresh air. It was one of the very rare times a crypto product made me say “wow, this is great.” It did, however, make altcoin trading much more competitive and spurred on what I consider the “proliferation of altcoins.”  Read more: TON-Based Economy Starting to Take Root in Telegram, TON Foundation Says  Does this mean altcoin trading/investing is dead? Far from it. The ease with which newcomers can now interact with smart contracts compared with what I had to do starting out is night-and-day. This, combined with distribution and increasingly useful apps means a new wave of capital flowing into crypto over the coming years.  Exciting, But There Remains Work To Be Done  The improvement we have here in UX cannot be overstated. I say this because I have myself onboarded non-crypto friends through TON's Wallet. Prior to Telegram’s current infrastructure, I would let out a small sigh at the prospect of trying to teach a friend how to use crypto. Now, thanks to Telegram, I do not see how it could be easier.  So that’s it, Telegram and TON have won, right? Not quite. The improvement in UX and distribution is a big leap forward, but we have yet to see a comprehensive range of consumer-facing apps. Mini apps are being developed and there is a major incentive for game devs to build a fun Telegram game that captures the attention of its huge user base. Alas, what exists now is more meme-based than utility-based. Regulations also remain a concern, but that is an ongoing industry-wide issue not isolated to Telegram or TON.  Telegram and TON have a lot to do, but I believe they will pull it off. The market seems to be pricing this in now, as $TON has already reached the top-10 crypto list in market cap. $TON’s run has largely been fueled by fervent speculation we are so familiar with, but there are real fundamentals to back up a lot of its growth.  Most of us want to see a future where crypto is being used by the masses. This sentiment is shared by Telegram’s co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov, who is a major Bitcoin advocate. TON’s mission statement is to “put crypto in every pocket.” Simply put, Telegram is better positioned to make that happen than any other entity in our growing industry.

29729331,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625599,1718888401,"Solana Could Face A 41% Crash, Warns Mechanism Capital Co-Founder","Andrew Kang, co-founder of Mechanism Capital, voiced concerns over the potential volatility and impending price correction of Solana (SOL) in a market analysis posted on X. His comments come amid a broader dialogue concerning the delayed second wave of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which he now anticipates could be pushed back by one to two quarters. He states, “I believe the timeline for this is delayed by 1-2 quarters. Some market views. Experts now suggest that solicitation approval/ETFs added to wealth management platforms is slated for Q4 instead of late May as originally suggested.” He believes that this delay in ETF approvals could result in a lack of immediate capital influx into the market, thereby potentially reversing the current upward momentum. Impacting the broader crypto market, Kang’s prediction for Solana, Kang’s prognosis is less optimistic. He highlights Solana’s price volatility, which has been significantly influenced by meme-driven trading activities. “Solana has been a great horse this cycle but it’s seen the reflexivity from the meme trading demand works in both directions. If meme trading takes a pause for the next few months, then you’ll likely be able to buy SOL near $80 again,” he remarked, indicating a potential 41% decline in SOL’s price from its current price level. Reasons For A Potential Solana Price Crash Crypto analyst TexasHedge further elaborated on Kang’s insights, providing a nuanced view of the market dynamics that influenced Solana’s price movements. He discussed the historical attractiveness of Solana as a high-risk, high-reward investment, often referred to metaphorically as “the world’s best casino.” Related Reading: Bitcoin And Solana Brace For Quiet Q3: What Crypto Traders Should Know This environment attracted significant capital inflows, which were crucial in driving up Solana’s valuation during its peak periods. “Kang’s SOL commentary makes a lot of sense. Solana remains arguably the best casino in the world, but casino outflows are as painful for the SOL token as inflows were beneficial,” the crypto analyst noted. TexasHedge shared his previous investment approach, which saw Solana as a compelling trade based on several factors: Initially, it involved the re-rating of Solana, which had been considered a laggard in the crypto space due to the FTX collapse but then gained momentum. Another factor was the strong influx of capital into SOL because of the memecoin frenzy. Lastly, Solana’s movement often mirrored broader crypto market trends, benefiting from the overall market beta. Related Reading: Solana Down 40% But Analyst Says Now’s The Time To Buy SOL Reflecting on these factors, TexasHedge remarked, “I liked SOL in October 2023 as a three-part trade: (i) re-rating of a presumed dead chain, (ii) inflows into the world’s best casino, and (iii) crypto beta. Now, you’re largely just left with (iii), at much higher levels, and amid a backdrop in which it is hard to make a great case that SOL is the best expression of crypto beta.” Moreover, the analyst pointed out several structural challenges that Solana faces, which might contribute to a downward price correction. These include an inherent annual inflation of 5.21%, translating to about 82,570 SOL entering the market each year—worth approximately $11.1 million at current prices—and the regular monthly release of locked SOL purchased from FTX, which increases supply and potentially depresses prices if demand doesn’t match up. “Even absent a cooling of memecoin mania, the outlook over the next few months is challenging,” TexasHedge concluded, indicating a tough road ahead for Solana amidst reduced speculative memecoin trading and ongoing market pressures. At press time, SOL traded at $137.

The complexity of crypto and on-chain assets is abstracted away, leaving a Web2-like context easily integrated with existing accounting software.  Cryptocurrency custody firm Fireblocks will offer clients the ability to generate audit-ready reports in one click in a deal with Tres, a startup that helps organizations handle accounting, auditing and tax reporting for digital assets as it anticipates growing interest in areas like tokenization of real-world assets.  The reports can be integrated with accounting software such as QuickBooks, Xero and NetSuite, the companies said in an announcement on Thursday.  Tokenizing traditional assets is a growing trend among financial institutions, and many other organizations have started holding bitcoin and adding it to their balance sheets. This means more chief financial officers, non-crypto-native analysts and risk teams will need to interact with on-chain data, which is indecipherable in its current form, said Adam Levine, SVP of corporate development and partnerships at Fireblocks.  As crypto becomes more widely adopted, firms will need a context that's as familiar as the Web2 world, where it's a breeze to create reports and workflows that fit seamlessly into existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, said Tal Zackon, co-founder and CEO of TRES.  “When you’re sitting at a board meeting and the CEO says, 'I've got this idea we should tokenize assets, or we should get into crypto and payments in USDC,' the first person to knock on the table during that board meeting was a CFO saying they don’t know how to handle these kind of assets,” Zackon said in an interview. “Well now it's easy for them.

42408007,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8kQU,1718886599,Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Acquires 11.9K More Bitcoin for $786M,"Nasdaq-listed software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin {{BTC}}, has acquired another 11,931 BTC for $786 million, according to a Thursday morning press release.  Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company as of the end of April held 214,400 bitcoins. This latest acquisition brings the company's total holdings to 226,331 tokens worth just under $15 billion at bitcoin's current price of roughly $66,000. The company's bitcoins were purchased at an average price of $36,798 each, or roughly $8.33 billion.  This most recent purchase followed the company's $800 million convertible note offering to institutional investors. That offering size was originally to be for $500, then raised to $700M and finally closed at $800M. In March, the company added 9,245 BTC for $623 million after raising money in a similar debt issuance.  Saylor and MicroStrategy started accumulating the largest and oldest cryptocurrency in 2020 and since have attempted to spearhead a movement to adopt BTC as a reserve asset for other corporate treasuries. While a handful of companies have added modest amounts of bitcoin to their balance sheet, of particular note is U.S.-listed Semler Scientific (SMLR), which over the past three weeks has not only added bitcoin as a relatively sizable treasury asset, but – in similar fashion to MicroStrategy – is attempting to tap capital markets to buy bitcoin in amounts far larger than what its current market cap might indicate.  MicroStrategy shares have risen roughly ten-fold since the firm's bitcoin purchases began four years ago. Semler shares are higher by more than 60% since the company disclosed its first bitcoin buys in late May.  Last week, brokerage firm Bernstein initiated coverage of Microstrategy, setting a $2,890 price target for the company's shares with an outperform rating. MSTR is currently up 2% premarket to $1,507.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/20/michael-saylors-microstrategy-acquires-119k-more-bitcoin-for-786m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dbb2fea217b52998d1955532b0481c1c36b133c8-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The FCA said it will do everything in its power to stop crypto firms from operating illegally.  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and London's police force arrested two people suspected of operating an illegal $1.3 billion crypto business.  ""More than 1 billion [pounds] of unregistered crypto assets are believed to have been bought and sold through this business,"" the regulator said in a press release on Thursday.  The suspects, aged 38 and 44, were interviewed under caution by the FCA and released on bail. During the investigation, the FCA inspected the offices associated with the two and the Metropolitan Police seized several digital devices during searches in two London residential properties.  The investigation continues. The FCA declined to add any further details.  Since January 2021, crypto asset services must be registered with the FCA under its anti-money laundering rules. So far, just 44 companies have succeeded in landing on the register despite over 300 businesses trying.  The U.K. also recently awarded the police with more powers to seize and freeze crypto and crypto-related items when conducting investigations.  ""The FCA has an important role to play in keeping dirty money out of the U.K. financial system,"" Therese Chambers, the FCA's executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said in the statement. ""These arrests show we will do everything in our power to stop crypto firms from operating illegally in the U.K.""  The regulator may be leaning more into its enforcement powers after being called out by the U.K.'s spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, late last year for being too slow to take enforcement action.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/20/uk-regulator-fca-arrests-two-people-associated-with-1b-pound-illegal-crypto-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eab93fb28591f28e6961bc9a521c6739853d47e8-1655x931.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto assets enjoyed a rally during the European morning, lifting bitcoin around 1.5% over 24 hours to $66,300 and ether 2% to $3,600. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has climbed about 1%, with Avalanche's AVAX the biggest gainer at just under 3.9%. XRP has risen by 1.5%, while Solana's SOL gained 1.3%.SOL, as the closest thing to an ether competitor in the altcoin market, may be experiencing downside as traders anticipate the listing of spot ETH ETFs in the U.S., an event thought likely sometime in the next few months.  The VanEck Bitcoin ETF (VBTC) started trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). This is the first exchange-traded fund to list on the ASX, the country's largest stock exchange. VBTC rose 1% from its opening price to end the day at A$20.06 ($13.4) after trading 99,791 shares. The ETF is a feeder fund that provides exposure to bitcoin by investing in the company's Bitcoin Trust (HODL), a U.S. ETF listed on Cboe. At the start of this month, the first Australian spot bitcoin ETF, Monochrome Asset Management’s IBTC, debuted on Cboe Australia, a smaller rival to ASX.  Tokens said to be using AI technology have surged as much as 35% in the last 24 hours. Fetch.ai’s FET, SingularityNET’s AGIX and Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN led the advance while the sector added 15% on average. The growth followed gains in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)'s stock, which has risen 5% since Monday, making it the most valuable company in the world. ""AI as a sector is hot in both traditional markets and crypto,” Edward Wilson, an analyst at Nansen.ai told CoinDesk. “It should come as no surprise that on the back of Nvidia becoming the world's most valuable company AI tokens are rallying.”  Chart of the Day  The number of bitcoin held in wallets associated with miners has declined to 1.802 million BTC, the lowest since April 2019.  Faster selling by miners is one of the factors stopping bitcoin from keeping pace with Nasdaq.

The draft decree reviewed by Reuters said fines as high as 5 million euros ($5.4 million) could be imposed.  Italy is set to adopt measures that will include high fines for those who manipulate the crypto asset market as part of a wider scheme to beef up surveillance of risks tied to the sector, Reuters reported, citing a draft decree it reviewed.  The document is due to be approved by the cabinet later today and will include fines between 5,000 euros ($5,400) and 5 million euros for insider trading, unlawful disclosure of inside information or market manipulation, the report said.  Countries in the European Union are gearing up to implement the bloc's regulatory framework for the sector, known as the Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA). Part of that process is deciding on which local regulators will help supervise crypto – referred to as National Competent Authorities (NCA).  The Reuters report said the draft decree designates Italy's central bank and market watchdog, Consob, as the relevant authorities.  Italy has been preparing to follow the framework for some time, with the governor of the central bank adding the caveat that it is doing so despite a survey showing only about 2% of Italian households held ""modest amounts, on average"" of crypto and that the exposure of Italian intermediaries to the market was also very limited.  Italy set up mandatory registration requirement for crypto company operating in the nation but approved 73 firms as virtual currency service providers without running proper checks to make sure they are safe for investors, CoinDesk reported previously.  Optimism about crypto in Italy has been reflected by moves such as one from Conio, a cryptocurrency wallet company, which teamed up with Coinbase (COIN) to bring digital assets to Italian banks and financial institutions.

42408012,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8kh1,1718884602,LayerZero Says Users Must Pay 10 Cents per ZRO to Claim Token,"LayerZero's ZRO token airdrop requires recipients to donate 10 cents worth of ether (ETH) or a stablecoin for each token they wish to claim.  This ""proof-of-donation"" mechanism is a unique approach in the crypto community, where donations are usually voluntary, and has received mixed reactions from users.  LayerZero’s newly introduced ZRO token, which will go live on Thursday, requires claimants to pay 10 cents worth of ether (ETH) or a stablecoin for each token they want to unlock from their airdrop kitty.  “By donating to Protocol Guild, eligible recipients show long-term alignment with the LayerZero protocol and a commitment to the future of crypto,” LayerZero said in an X post. “To claim ZRO, users must donate $0.10 in USDC, USDT, or native ETH per ZRO. This small donation goes directly to the Protocol Guild.”  “The LayerZero Foundation is matching all donations up to $10 million,” it added.  The so-called “proof-of-donation” mechanism is the first time a project is asking users to donate a small amount of money to claim tokens. While crypto donations are commonplace and appreciated among developers in the market, they are usually not mandated or placed as a requirement upon users – especially for an airdrop.  Early reactions in the crypto community were mixed. Some users expressed their disagreement with the move, while others stated it would help support development.  Airdrops refer to the distribution of tokens to project users, usually based on their interaction with that blockchain or usage of related products. LayerZero is one of the most-anticipated and high-profile airdrops for 2024, with 85 million ZRO set to be available for distribution on Thursday.  Over 50% of the supply has been earmarked for investors and core contributors subject to a three-year vesting period with a one-year lock and a monthly unlock over the following two years.  Meanwhile, ZRO trades at $4.27 in pre-market futures trading ahead of its Thursday launch.

Of the many crypto bills in the U.S. political corridors, stablecoin legislation has been the closest to moving past the U.S. Congress to become law.  Stablecoin issuers are fast emerging as a significant source of demand for the U.S. Treasury notes as concerns about Washington's debt management grow.  'According to data tracked by Tagus Capital, issuers now cumulatively hold more than $120 billion in U.S. Treasury notes. That makes them the world's 18th largest holders of U.S. debt, ahead of major current account surplus nations like Germany and South Korea.  Tether Ltd, the issuer of tether (USDT), the world's leading dollar-pegged cryptocurrency by market value, alone holds around $91 billion in Treasuries and Circle, the issuer of USDC, holds short-dated U.S. debt, including repos, worth $29 billion, according to Tagus Capital.  Coincidentally, of the many crypto bills in the U.S. political corridors, stablecoin legislation has been the closest to moving past the U.S. Congress to become law. Hopes that the U.S. will get a new stablecoin law before the elections this year remain. In April, key congressman Patrick McHenry was bullish that the U.S. would have a stablecoin law by the end of the year.  However, attempts to include a stablecoin regulation in an unrelated must-move reauthorization bill failed. McHenry later told CoinDesk that “we’re so close on this, we just need a legislative calendar, so that we can get things across the finish line in the Senate.”  He also echoed the sentiment of the Majority Whip in the House of Representatives, Republican Tom Emmer who suggested that the lame duck session, might be the opportune time to attach a legislation to a must-pass bill. A lame duck session occurs in the transition period after elections before the president-elect takes over in January 2025.  The U.S. government debt surpassed the $34 trillion mark early this year and has been growing faster, roughly $1 trillion every 100 years. Interest payments on the debt, also known as the debt-servicing cost, are projected to reach $892 billion in 2024. The burgeoning debt has caused the Treasury to step up bond supplies since 2023.  On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office said the national debt could reach $50 trillion by 2034, equaling 122 percent of annual economic output.  Early this year, COB warned that Unattended mounting debt concerns could lead to Liz-Truss-style market chaos, characterized by the sharp drop in the U.S. dollar and political uncertainty. Crypto pundits have long echoed a similar sentiment, saying debt concerns and loss of confidence in Treasuries could spur widespread adoption of alternative assets like bitcoin and gold.",POSITIVE,USDT,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,"Omkar Godbole, Amitoj Singh",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/20/stablecoin-issuers-now-18th-largest-holder-of-us-debt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/892347fec52a972d6a246343ef3261b1226d2ce9-1280x958.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The now-completed Project Helvetia III involved the issuance of seven digital bonds, totaling more than 750 million francs ($843 million).  The Swiss National Bank (SNB) and SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) exploration of settling tokenized securities through a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) is entering a new phase that will see other financial institutions and types of transactions added over the coming two years.  Interest in tokenization is adding momentum to CBDC experimentation for institutional market participants looking to settle big trading transactions on blockchains. As well as the Swiss efforts, there are moves like Project Agorá, which involves a number of central banks and the Bank for International Settlements.  The next phase of the deployment follows the completion this month of Project Helvetia III, which involved the issuance of seven digital bonds totaling more than 750 million francs ($843 million) and was “a resounding success,” according to David Newns, head of SIX Digital Exchange.  “What we’re talking about here is as good as the traditional infrastructure,” Newns said in an interview. “Now we've achieved that sort of equivalence for digital securities around the cash leg, these are eligible for inclusion in the collateral market so you can use them for repo. We have bridges into traditional finance, so an issuer can reach that entire liquidity base you get on a traditional exchange. And as a result of the project, participating members have now tripled, and are using us as a way to further their own digital ambitions.”  Like many other central banks, the SNB is not interested in retail CBDC experimentation, only the digital cash flow from institutions for wholesale securities settlement.  Newns said other approaches were considered, such as a trigger mechanism in the real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) of the central bank every time a transaction takes place on a blockchain, or a bankruptcy-remote entity holding members' deposits in some kind of stablecoin.  “But nothing really works like central bank money does, which is why it is the settlement asset that everyone prefers to use whenever possible,” Newns said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/20/swiss-national-bank-and-sdx-delve-deeper-into-cbdcs-tokenized-securities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5495d80f3a35a732a2aac1ed3845ecae2626fe88-1022x575.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29726595,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625610,1718883054,Ethereum At A Crossroads: Big Move Coming After Consolidation Phase?,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently at a critical juncture as its price enters a consolidation phase. This period of price stability, marked by a narrow trading range, has left traders and investors in a state of uncertainty. With Ethereum’s price hovering around key support and resistance levels, market participants are closely monitoring technical indicators and market signals to anticipate the next move. The current consolidation reflects a balance between bullish optimism and bearish caution, creating an environment of indecision that could lead to significant volatility once a breakout direction is established. This analysis delves into examining Ethereum’s current price state to determine its potential future price action. Market Overview: Ethereum Current Trends And Analysis Currently, on the 4-hour chart, the price of Ethereum is moving upward toward the upper level of the consolidation zone, but it is still trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). A careful examination of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator reveals that ETH’s price may still move upward as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are trending above the zero line. From this formation, it can be suggested that Ethereum may likely move to test the upper base of the consolidation before dropping again. On the 1-day chart, ETH is actively bullish moving toward the upper base of the consolidation zone while still trading above the 100-day SMA. With the way ETH’s price is moving, it may move on to test the upper base of the consolidation. The 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator indicator reveals that although ETH is currently bullish, it may go bearish in the long run as both the signal line and the SMA are attempting to cross below the zero line. Potential Scenarios: What’s Next For ETH? A look at potential future scenarios for Ethereum’s movement post-consolidation suggests that if the price of ETH breaks above the upper base of the consolidation, it will begin to move upward toward the $4,099 resistance level. If the price breaches this level, it may move on to test its all-time high of $4,863. In contrast, should the crypto asset break below the lower base of the consolidation, it will begin to move downward toward the $2,865 support level. If this level is breached, it will continue to move downward to test the $2,147 and probably other lower levels. As of the time of writing, ETH was trading at around $3,607 and was down by 1.82% with a market capitalization of over $440 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $13 billion.

Coinalyze data shows that Dogecoin {{DOGE}} funding rates have started to turn negative since Tuesday, reaching -0.0027% as of Thursday – reaching levels previously seen in October 2023. Funding rates are periodic payments made by traders based on the difference between prices in the futures and spot markets.  While these rates are not unusually large, they indicate a bearish mood in the market when continually declining alongside a drop in prices. DOGE has lost 12% over the past week, erasing all gains since March.  DOGE open interest, or the number of unsettled futures contracts, have decreased from nearly $800 million on Monday to $611 million as of Thursday, also indicating a drop in demand for the tokens.  The rates briefly turned red over a few eight-hour trading sessions in March, but not for an extended period as seen this week so far.  Tokens across the meme coin sector have recorded losses of as much as 40% over a seven-day period as traders caution a move away from riskier tokens to bitcoin and stablecoins.  “When the price of Bitcoin falls, memecoins tend not only to follow, but to lose an even greater share of their value,” shared Neil Roarty, analyst at investment platform Stocklytics, in a Thursday email to CoinDesk. “Any plans for a memecoin summer may have to be put on hold.”  As reported earlier this week, DOGE futures traders recorded their worst day since May 2021 as the token saw $60 million in longs liquidated, unusually more than for bitcoin (BTC) futures.  These drops came as bitcoin (BTC) prices suffered in the past few weeks amid $2 billion in sales from large holders, net outflows from U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and dollar strength.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/20/dogecoin-traders-appear-to-short-token-as-meme-coin-frenzy-eases,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45966b878bf647cb2f088f88deba6ee99b06802b-5999x3374.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite tentative signs of recovery after recent dips, the price has struggled to stay afloat in the last 30 days. Additionally, a more intriguing trend has emerged: a mass exodus of ETH from cryptocurrency exchanges. This movement, marked by declining exchange supply and net outflows, has analysts buzzing with potential bullish implications. Related Reading: Bitcoin Takes Control In Market Meltdown, Dominance Climbs To 9-Week Peak Dwindling Stockpiles: Exchanges Feeling The Squeeze For years, cryptocurrency exchanges have served as the lifeblood of the digital asset market. They provide the platform for buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrencies, with a significant portion of any given coin’s total supply residing within their digital vaults. However, when it comes to ETH, a dramatic shift seems to be underway. According to a recent analysis of on-chain data, the balance of ETH on exchanges has plummeted to its lowest level in eight years, hovering around a mere 10.20%. This translates to a significant portion of ETH holders withdrawing their coins from exchanges, effectively taking them off the market for immediate sale. The reasons behind this exodus remain open to speculation. Some experts believe it could be a strategic move in anticipation of the upcoming Ethereum Merge, a major network upgrade that will transition the blockchain from proof-of-work to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake model. This shift could potentially unlock staking opportunities for ETH holders, incentivizing them to hold onto their coins for longer periods. Outflows Dominate: A Sign Of Accumulation Or Caution? Further bolstering the “accumulation theory” is the dominance of net outflows on exchanges in recent days. This metric tracks the difference between ETH entering and leaving exchange wallets. A negative netflow, as seen currently, indicates that more ETH is flowing out than coming in. This suggests that investors are not only withdrawing their existing holdings but also refraining from depositing new ETH onto exchanges, potentially signaling a growing sense of long-term bullishness. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over $1 Billion In Bitcoin: Fire Sale Or Foreshadowing? However, some analysts caution against overly optimistic interpretations. The decline in exchange supply could also be attributed to a more cautious investor sentiment in the face of recent market volatility. With the broader cryptocurrency market still recovering from a slump, some holders might be opting to move their ETH to private wallets for safekeeping, waiting for a more opportune moment to re-enter the market.

The start of trading, weeks after an ETF from Monochrome Asset Management listed on a smaller exchange, is a sign the global BTC ETF wave has arrived in the country.  Australia's biggest equity exchange listed its first spot-bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Thursday as demand for an easy way of investing in cryptocurrencies gathers pace worldwide.  The VanEck Bitcoin ETF (VBTC) went live on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), which accounts for 90% of the country's equity market. The exchange approved the product listing earlier this week.  VBTC rose 1% from its opening price to end the day at A$20.06 ($13.4) after trading 99,791 shares. The ETF is a feeder fund that provides exposure to bitcoin by investing in the company's Bitcoin Trust (HODL), a U.S. ETF listed on Cboe.  While the start of trading comes about six months after spot bitcoin products listed in the U.S., and about seven weeks after they debuted in Hong Kong, the product is not the first to offer bitcoin to Australian investors.  Monochrome Asset Management’s Monochrome bitcoin ETF (IBTC) went live on June 4 on the Cboe Australia exchange, a smaller rival of ASX. Unlike VBTC, the fund holds bitcoin directly. Since its launch, IBTC has traded an average of around 55,000 units a day on daily average cash volumes of about A$550,000.  Together the two exchange-traded funds signal a bitcoin ETF wave arriving in Australia, according to the Australian Financial Review.

42408021,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8l7T,1718874755,"Solana-Ether Ratio Hits 3-Month Low, Analyst Anticipates Further Losses","The SOL/ETH ratio slides as ether ETF narrative weighs over altcoins.  Technicals have flipped bearish, signaling more losses ahead for the ratio.  A month ago, CoinDesk discussed how spot ether {{ETH}} ETF speculation could spur an outflow of money from altcoins, including Solana's SOL token and into ether.  The market has since behaved as expected, with the ratio between SOL and ETH's dollar-denominated prices falling nearly 35% to 0.038 on Binance, the lowest since March 13, according to charting platform TradingView.  The decline has put the bears in control and further losses could be seen, according to crypto trader and analyst Josh Olszewicz.  ""SOL/ETH [is] rolling over,"" Olszewicz said on X, noting key bearish developments on the technical chart like the penetration of the Ichimoku cloud support.  Japanese journalist Goichi Hosada created the Ichimoku Cloud in the late 1960s. The indicator comprises five lines: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K) and a lagging closing price line. The difference between Leading Span A and B makes up the cloud, which is used to identify broader trends.  Crossovers below the cloud, as in SOL/ETH's case, represent a bearish shift in the market trend.  The SOL/ETH chart also shows a failure of a usually bullish pattern called the ascending triangle, identified by a rising support line and a horizontal resistance line.  Ascending triangles develop when buyers are dominant and usually pave the way for extending the preceding uptrend. However, the SOL/ETH pair has dived below the ascending trendline support line, signaling a bearish trend change.  Though the path of least resistance is to the downside, the pair may see temporary recovery rallies should there be outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, according to Olzewicz.  Note that in the month following the debut of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF saw $6.5 billion in outflows, offsetting substantial inflows into the other funds. Following the expected debut of spot ETFs in July, a similar dynamic might be seen in the ether market, keeping ETH gains in check.  Lastly, per Olszewicz, SOL may find takers if BlackRock applies to launch an ETF tied to SOL, although Olzewicz says the ETF giant is unlikely to do so.  ""Watching for: - ETHE outflows pushing this pair higher, temporarily - Larry SOL ETF application, unlikely otherwise, this pair should continue to decline if the ETH ETF is successful,"" Olszewicz said.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/20/solana-ether-ratio-hits-3-month-low-analyst-anticipates-further-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a5a928a944a0b7e8d9d9764394815d6f27a12ad-1280x934.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The growth in AI token prices mirrored a rise in Nvidia's stock, which became the most valuable company globally, highlighting the market's increasing interest in AI-related technologies.  Tokens of projects said to be using artificial intelligence (AI) technology surged as much as 35% in the past 24 hours, leading gains as a sector amid a little-changed broader crypto market.  Fetch.ai’s FET, SingularityNET’s AGIX, and Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN led growth in the AI token sector, CoinGecko data shows, while the sector added 15% on average. Tokens above a $100 million capitalization added a minimum of 4% – beating a 0.22% rise in the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.  Such growth mirrored a surge in chipmaker Nvidia’s (NVIDIA) stocks, whose 5% surge since Monday made it the most valuable company in the world, surpassing Microsoft. Nvidia is not directly related to any crypto companies, but growth in its stock prices tends to move AI-related tokens.  AI broadly refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and act like humans. Since early 2023, traders have predicted the sector to lead gains in the next crypto market, and the hopes have been accurate so far.  ""AI as a sector is hot in both traditional markets and crypto,” Edward Wilson, analyst at Nansen.ai told CoinDesk in a Telegram message Thursday. “It should come as no surprise that on the back of Nvidia becoming the world's most valuable company AI tokens are rallying.”  “Tokens such as NEAR and RNDR are up around 300% in the past year, compared to ETH at just over 100% during the same time period, showing high market interest in this sector,” he added.

29719323,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625581,1718868643,"It’s ‘Do Or Die’ For Bitcoin Price Soon, Says Analyst","Josh Olszewicz, a renowned crypto analyst, has recently shared critical insights into the immediate Bitcoin price future, employing two technical analysis frameworks: the Ichimoku Cloud and Bollinger Bands. These tools hint at pivotal moments that could shape the trajectory of the Bitcoin price in the near to medium term. Bitcoin Analysis Using The Ichimoku Cloud In the first chart featuring the daily Ichimoku Cloud, Olszewicz highlights a critical moment for Bitcoin as it navigates through this complex indicator. The Ichimoku Cloud, known for providing support and resistance levels as well as momentum and trend direction, shows Bitcoin trading near the edge of the cloud. This is significant because a break above the cloud could suggest a bullish outlook, while falling below the cloud often signals bearish momentum. Here, Olszewicz emphasizes a ‘do or die’ scenario for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin, as recorded last on the chart at $64,570, approaches the edge of the cloud. “No one likes an ultimatum but it’s do or die here pretty soon on the daily BTC cloud,” warned. Related Reading: IntoTheBlock Reveals Fact About Current Bitcoin Situation Analysts Are Puzzled By A significant aspect of the Ichimoku Cloud chart is the relationship between the Tenkan-Sen (red line) and the Kijun-Sen (blue line). The Tenkan-Sen, which is a shorter-term moving average, remains above the Kijun-Sen, a longer-term moving average, indicating a positive momentum in the short run. Bollinger Bands Weekly Analysis Moving to the weekly chart equipped with Bollinger Bands, Olszewicz discusses another potential inflection point. Bollinger Bands serve as a measure of volatility—narrow bands suggest low volatility while wider bands indicate higher volatility. The Bitcoin chart shows a tightening of these bands around the current price level, which may precede a significant price movement, often referred to as a “Bollinger Band Squeeze.” The fact that Bitcoin is hovering just above the midline (the 20-period moving average) of the Bollinger Bands at $64,238 points to a tenuous balance between buying and selling forces. However, the narrowing of the bands is particularly notable because it could lead to a decisive breakout or breakdown, depending on other market factors and trader sentiment. If Bitcoin breaks below the midline, the next support could be found at the lower Bollinger Band, currently positioned around $51,792, which could represent a significant downturn in price. Conversely, should Bitcoin bounce off the midline and gain upward momentum, it might target the upper Bollinger Band, situated at approximately $76,684, indicating a potential rally. Related Reading: Ikigai Founder Explains Why Bitcoin And Crypto Are ‘On The Verge Of Cannibalism’ The analyst points out that understanding the implications of a Bollinger Band Squeeze could be crucial for traders, as such periods of low volatility often end in sharp price moves. “If you didn’t like the Cloud ultimatum, here’s the weekly BBands,” remarked Olszewicz. Both charts, though using different analytical tools, converge on a similar narrative: Bitcoin is at a potential turning point that could define its price action for the coming days or weeks. The current levels close to the upper boundaries of both the Ichimoku Cloud and the Bollinger Bands underscore the tension in the market. At press time, BTC traded at $65,494.

42408036,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8rZY,1718864807,Monero's XMR Token Reverses February Slide With Golden Cross,"XMR briefly topped $180 last week, reversing the Binance-led February slide.  The token has gained nearly 25% in four weeks amid a crackdown on Botnet mining.  XMR's daily chart shows a bullish golden cross pattern.  It is said that markets typically fall fast and rise slowly. This year's price action of privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) is a perfect example.  XMR crashed over 35% to $100 in early February after Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume and open interest, delisted the token, saying it didn't meet the exchange's standard.  It has taken XMR four months to recoup the slide. The cryptocurrency briefly topped $180 last week, hitting the highest since January 23, and was last seen changing hands near $170 on Kraken, according to charting platform TradingView.  XMR has gained nearly 25% in four weeks, outperforming most top 100 cryptocurrencies by market value, including bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}.  While the exact reason for the price surge is not apparent, social media chatter suggests the recent crackdown on Botnet mining in some European countries may have helped.  Botnet mining is a malicious practice of remotely using a compromised computer network to mine a cryptocurrency. Cybercriminals have long preferred XMR for botnet mining as its privacy features make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to track the flow of funds obtained through botnet mining and other illegal activities.  The recent decision by 2Miners, one of the leading monero mining pools, to discontinue mining XMR may have also contributed to the rally. The miner announced the XMR delisting on June 10.  Golden cross  It's worth noting that while XMR has reversed the February slide, it is yet to break out of the two-year trading range of $100-$185. Momentum studies do suggest the potential for a breakout ahead.  For instance, the 50-day simple moving average of XMR's price has crossed above the 200-day SMA, confirming what is known as a golden cross. The pattern suggests a potential long-term bullish shift in momentum.",POSITIVE,BTC | XMR,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING | XMR,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/20/moneros-xmr-token-reverses-february-slide-with-golden-cross,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09c2b9732ce3f04ac03a867a1cab3d58e9d9656c-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This surge in investor positioning coincides with the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Whales Dump Over $1 Billion In Bitcoin: Fire Sale Or Foreshadowing? Bullish Bets On The Horizon Cryptocurrency analysis platform CryptoQuant detected a significant increase in XRP’s open interest, indicating a growing number of investors entering positions. This trend suggests a bullish sentiment, with investors betting on a potential price appreciation for XRP in the near future. The logic is simple: more investors entering the market with buy orders typically drives the price upwards. Recent developments in the SEC lawsuit, which accuses Ripple of selling unregistered securities in the form of XRP, seem to be buoying investor confidence. A recent court decision, for instance, may have provided some clarity on the legal classification of XRP, potentially paving the way for a more favorable outcome for Ripple. Volatility Ahead: Potential Market Swirls While the surge in open interest is a positive sign for XRP bulls, CryptoQuant warns of potential market volatility on the horizon. Rising open interest can be a double-edged sword. It indicates increased market activity, but it can also lead to higher volatility. A market with high open interest can resemble a busy intersection. Increased activity can lead to more opportunities, but it also raises the risk of sudden changes. Just as drivers need to be extra cautious at a crowded intersection, investors in a market with high open interest need to be prepared for potential volatility as new information or shifting market sentiment prompts investors to adjust their positions quickly. This potential volatility underscores the importance of caution for XRP investors. While the current trend suggests optimism, it’s crucial to remember that the outcome of the SEC lawsuit remains uncertain and the broader cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. Related Reading: Analyst’s Bullish Call: Bitcoin Primed For Massive Jump To $127,000 XRP Price Prediction Meanwhile, XRP is predicted to rise by 21% to reach $0.602 by July 19, 2024. Despite this optimistic forecast, the current market sentiment remains bearish, indicating caution among traders. However, the Fear & Greed Index at 64 shows a state of greed, suggesting positive market activity and buying interest despite the prevailing caution. In the past 30 days, XRP has seen 14 green days, or 47% of the period, indicating moderate positivity.

Bitcoin Adoption Has Slowed Down To Multi-Year Lows Recently Bitcoin had a great first quarter in 2024, fueled by demand from the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional entities. During this run, the asset surpassed the all-time high (ATH) set back in the previous bull run, breaking a pattern in other cycles where ATHs were only reached after the Halving. Related Reading: Dogecoin, Cardano “Very Bullish” Based On MVRV: Santiment With the huge demand, things looked to be just getting started for the asset, but in the months since the ATH, the cryptocurrency has only been consolidating sideways. In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock talks about the current situation with Bitcoin, which many have been wondering about. The analytics firm has pointed out that the transfer activity on the BTC network has been high recently, as the Number of Transactions metric has set a new record. The most recent spike in the Number of Transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain has resulted from the emergence of the new Runes protocol, which allows users to mint fungible tokens on the network efficiently. “Institutional whales are present, and activity on the Bitcoin network is high,” says the analytics firm. “So, where’s the confusion?” The answer to that question lies in the trend of the New Addresses indicator. As its name suggests, this metric keeps track of the total number of new addresses that are popping up on the network daily. This indicator tells us about the rate of adoption the cryptocurrency is observing. Below is a chart showing how this Bitcoin metric’s value has changed over the past decade. The graph shows that the Bitcoin New Addresses has declined while the price has risen to its new high. As IntoTheBlock notes: The data reveals that this surge in usage and whale activity does not involve a significant influx of new participants. In fact, the number of new Bitcoin users has plummeted to a multi-year low, even falling below the levels seen during the 2018 bear market. Related Reading: Hard To Be “Too Scared Of Bitcoin Price Action,” Says Analyst. Here’s Why Historically, bull markets have accompanied sharp asset adoption as new investors get attracted by all the hype. In return, this influx of holders has helped fuel the rally. It would appear that despite the asset reaching a new ATH, the network has failed to attract new users. This is what has got many puzzled. The slowdown could, at least in part, be why Bitcoin has failed to continue its bullish momentum. It now remains to be seen whether this will change for the coin soon or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $65,000, down 7% in the past week.

Chainlink Price Eyes Additional Upsides In the past few sessions, Chainlink saw a decent upward move from the $13.00 zone. There was a move above the $13.50 and $14.00 levels. LINK bulls were in action unlike Bitcoin. However, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $14.50 and $14.65 levels. A high was formed at $14.63 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $13.16 swing low to the $14.46 high. Chainlink is now trading below the $15.00 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $14.40 on the hourly chart of the LINK/USD pair. Immediate resistance is near the $14.40 level or the triangle zone. The next major resistance is near the $14.65 zone. A clear break above $14.65 may possibly start a steady increase toward the $15.00 level. The next major resistance is near the $15.20 level, above which the price could test $15.85. Another Decline In LINK? If Chainlink’s price fails to climb above the $14.40 resistance level, there could be a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $14.00 level or the triangle trend line. The next major support is near the $13.80 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $13.16 swing low to the $14.46 high, below which the price might test the $13.50 level. Any more losses could lead LINK toward the $13.15 level in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for LINK/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for LINK/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $14.00 and $13.80.

29712786,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625518,1718856012,Nvidia Propels AI Crypto Tokens To Market Leadership: Here Are The Top 3 Winners,"Amid an overall market downtrend, crypto assets based on artificial intelligence (AI) have exhibited substantial gains, fueled by the AI frenzy permeating the traditional finance and crypto markets. This surge has been further augmented by the continuous rally of tech company Nvidia, which recently claimed the world’s most valuable company title, with its soaring share price reaching an all-time high. Fetch.ai Rides Nvidia’s Success Nvidia’s stock, now valued at $3.34 trillion, has nearly doubled in price since the beginning of the year, surpassing the likes of tech giants Microsoft and Apple. This rise has been attributed to Nvidia’s dominance in providing the essential chips required for artificial intelligence, often called the “new gold or oil in the tech sector” by analysts. Amidst these developments, AI-based crypto tokens have emerged as outperformers, overshadowing major cryptocurrencies that have experienced a sharp price correction led by Bitcoin (BTC). According to data from CoinGecko, notable gainers among AI tokens include Fetch.ai (FET), Singularity Net (AGIX), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN), with gains of 24%, 23.5%, and 22%, respectively, within the past 24 hours alone. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Hit $10,000, ‘Just The Way The Chips Have Fallen,’ Analyst Says On the one hand, FET experienced a significant recovery and broke its downtrend following a substantial price correction that brought it down to $1.10. Despite being down over 58% from its all-time high of $3.45 in March, blockchain research firm House of Chimera highlights potential real-world use cases for Fetch.ai. For instance, FET’s autonomous agents can optimize logistics by analyzing and predicting optimal routes, thereby reducing costs and improving delivery times. With the growing interest in AI applications in the industry and traditional finance, FET’s AI algorithms analyzing large datasets may lead to further price increases in the coming months. Currently, FET is trading at $1.44 with a market capitalization of $3.6 billion. Long-Term Potential For AI-Based Crypto Tokens Similarly, Singularity Net’s native token AGIX has followed a similar trajectory to FET, reaching a high of $1.46 in March but currently trading 58% lower at $0.6018. However, the underlying uses of the protocol, centered around the creation and monetization of AI services through its AI marketplace, suggest the potential for significant gains and investor interest in the long term. The native token of Ocean Protocol, OCEAN, also displays price actions comparable to those of AGIX and FET. Currently trading at $0.6094, OCEAN has witnessed a trading volume increase of over 20% in the last 24 hours. The protocol’s open-source model aims to facilitate the exchange and monetization of data and data-based services, with notable applications such as running AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds.

Wedbush Securities, a renowned financial firm, echoed this sentiment by predicting an intense race in the tech sector.

29710930,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625494,1718852411,Bitcoin And Solana Brace For Quiet Q3: What Crypto Traders Should Know,"As summer unfolds, the cryptocurrency market is showing little upward momentum. Particularly, crypto analyst Ansem has recently projected a steady course for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in the coming months. This forecast is grounded in a detailed analysis shared on Elon Musk’s social platform X, where Ansem highlighted potential trends and key scenarios that could influence these major cryptocurrencies’ performance. Ansem suggests that Bitcoin and Solana might not make bullish strides before the year’s late third or fourth quarter, but they have maintained stability above the March lows. Related Reading: Ikigai Founder Explains Why Bitcoin And Crypto Are ‘On The Verge Of Cannibalism’ This suggests a period of consolidation might be underway. However, the narrative for the broader altcoin market diverges significantly, with different coins showing varied trajectories. Ansem’s analysis points to a critical period of sideways movement that could set the stage for future price actions. The Technical Analysis: A Deeper Dive Into Market Movements According to Ansem, Bitcoin, and Solana have not dipped below their March lows, which might indicate a consolidation phase that precedes the next leg up. However, this stability isn’t mirrored across all digital assets. For instance, Avalanche (AVAX) and similar infrastructure projects show signs of breaking below these levels, suggesting a possible new downtrend or a capitulation phase before reclaiming critical levels. The XRP/BTC chart analysis reveals an interesting trend where Bitcoin and Solana might either maintain their resilience as market outliers or eventually succumb to broader market downturns. The scenarios laid out by Ansem include: BTC and SOL as Outliers: Bitcoin and Solana might continue to hold their current low levels of consolidation, with Bitcoin staying between $58,000 and $60,000 and Solana between $110 and $120. This scenario anticipates that while other altcoins might have already hit their lows, they will bottom out when majors do, following some sideways action. General Market Downturn: If BTC and SOL are not outliers, they might catch up with the downside experienced by the broader market. This could lead to a significant market capitulation, potentially pushing Bitcoin to between $48,000 and $52,000 and Solana to between $85 and $100. Total Market Peak: Ansem considers it highly unlikely that the entire market has peaked, dismissing this scenario as improbable. He suggests an extended period of sideways movement is a more plausible outcome. At the same time, application development within the crypto space continues, potentially buoyed by ongoing inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin And Solana: Synced Trends And Upcoming Altseason In recent trading sessions, Bitcoin and Solana have reflected similar price behaviors, both experiencing a modest 0.1% decrease over the last 24 hours. Despite this, their weekly performance diverges significantly; Bitcoin has dropped by 6.4%, while Solana has seen a sharper decline of 14.3%. Currently, Bitcoin’s price is $64,816, whereas Solana is trading at $136.81. Turning attention to broader market movements, Crypto analyst Moustache has recently shared his optimism about the potential for an upcoming Altseason, noting positive signals on Bitcoin’s three-week chart. Related Reading: Is Solana A Good Buy? Finance CEO Predicts ‘Magnificent’ Autumn Rally He emphasizes the importance of patience and strategic accumulation of quality altcoins during this phase, suggesting that “good things” are on the horizon for those who stay the course. #Altcoins BTC Dominance is about to make a bearish cross on the 3W-Chart and people still doubt if an Altseason will happen lol.

BTC even tested the $64,000 zone. A low was formed at $64,050 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a minor recovery above the $64,500 level.

Bitcoin is now trading below $65,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $65,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $65,400 level and the triangle trend line. The first major resistance could be $65,650 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $67,255 swing high to the $64,050 low. The next key resistance could be $66,000. A clear move above the $66,000 resistance might start a steady increase and send the price higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $66,550 resistance. Any more gains might send BTC toward the $67,500 resistance in the near term. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to climb above the $65,650 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $64,850 level. The first major support is $64,400. The next support is now forming near $64,000.

However, this lackluster price action has not deterred investors, who continue to believe in the long-term potential of the altcoin. One crypto analyst, in particular, expects the coin price to see another bullish wave that could push it toward the $1 price target. XRP Price Ready For Another Bullish Wave Crypto analyst Alan Santana has predicted a bullish future for the XRP price. The analyst shared a recent analysis which took into account the past performances of not just XRP, but also other crypto assets as well, highlighting their recent peaks. Related Reading: Is Solana A Good Buy? Finance CEO Predicts ‘Magnificent’ Autumn Rally The crypto analyst explained that all cryptocurrencies had time for their peaks, and then when they entered a bullish wave. Usually, this bullish wave tends to occur around 8-10 months following the previous peak, meaning that the XRP price is long overdue for a bullish wave. Alan Santana revealed that the last peak for XRP was back in July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres had ruled that programmatic XRP sales did not qualify as securities offerings. At the time, the XRP price had rallied over $0.7. However, once that bullish wave ended, the altcoin went into a decline that lasted almost one year. Presently, the XRP price has spent a total of 11 months without a bullish wave and given the established average of 8-10 months for cryptocurrencies between each bullish wave, the altcoin may be getting ready for another bullish wave. However, as the crypto analyst explains, not all bullish waves are the same for all crypto assets. This means that even if XRP were to see another bullish wave, it may not be as expected. Nevertheless, Alan Santana expects that the bullish wave will push the price further. How High Can The Price Go? Providing the possible target for where the XRP price may end up from here, the crypto analyst suggests that a 100% move is possible for the altcoin. One of the major targets highlighted is the $0.65, which is around a 50% increase in price from here. Related Reading: Shiba Inu To The Moon: Analyst Predicts A Run Above $0.00015 If This Happens However, that is not the highest the price is expected to go in its next bullish wave. According to Alan Santana’s chart, the XRP price could end up running as high as $0.9442 before it loses steam. From here, it is possible that the price does touch above the coveted $1 level before correcting back downward again.

29707242,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625475,1718845226,XRP’s Roadmap To Success: Analyst Forecast A Strong Bullish Turn In 2024,"Despite its recent decline, XRP, one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, now holds the potential for substantial gains. Particularly, according to a recent technical analysis by Amonyx, XRP is poised for a bullish run against both the United States dollar and Bitcoin throughout 2024. This optimism is grounded in several key technical indicators and historical price actions, suggesting that XRP might soon experience notable price movements. Related Reading: Altcoin Massacre? Prices Plummet 40-90%, Recovery Stalled — Analyst Technical Forecast: XRP Path In 2024 Amonyx’s technical assessment focuses on the long-term price trends of XRP, particularly its performance within an ascending channel established in 2014. The XRP/USD pair analysis points to consistent behavior within this channel, bounded by its upper and lower trendlines. Key Fibonacci retracement levels identified at 0.618, 0.786, 1.618, and 2.618 are seen as potential resistance and support zones. The analysis highlights these zones as pivotal areas where price reversals or consolidation might occur. Moreover, the analyst projects a bullish surge toward the 2.618 Fibonacci level by 2024, suggesting that investors might witness a significant uptick in XRP’s value. This ‘flip zone’ the analyst wrote on the chart at the upper end of the trend provides a theoretical point for the asset to consolidate or reverse, indicating critical trading opportunities. Turning to the XRP/BTC chart, a similar detailed examination reveals a persistent descending trendline starting from the same base year, 2014. This trendline has been a resistance point for XRP, with the price nearing another test of this boundary. The analysis includes observations of bullish and bearish divergences on momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), suggesting potential for upcoming price movements. The projected path on the XRP/BTC chart envisions a bullish trajectory for the 1.618 Fibonacci level, corroborating the bullish sentiments from the XRP/USD analysis. This convergence in analysis across different currency pairs further strengthens the case for XRP’s growth potential relative to both the dollar and Bitcoin. Current Market Position and Outlook Despite these optimistic projections, XRP’s price currently trades at $0.49, having recovered slightly by 1% after a nearly 10% decline over the past two weeks. Related Reading: This Is The Biggest Issue With Altcoins This Cycle: Crypto Analyst This recovery could be the onset of the anticipated bullish trend. Insights from CryptoQuant highlight an increase in XRP’s Open Interest (OI), particularly following developments related to regulatory news involving the SEC. This surge in OI indicates a growing interest from traders, aligning with the expected price increase. Meanwhile, Santiment has recently suggested that XRP’s current market conditions and a 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio of -3.5% place it in a mildly bullish category. 🐂 The lower a cryptocurrency’s 30-day MVRV is, the higher the likelihood we see a short-term bounce: Bitcoin: -4.0% (Mild Bullish) Ethereum: -4.3% (Mild Bullish) XRP: -3.5% (Mild Bullish) Dogecoin: -16.7% (Very Bullish) Toncoin: -0.6% (Neutral) Cardano: -12.6% (Very Bullish) pic.twitter.com/zHGg4t3qo1 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 19, 2024 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrps-roadmap-to-success-analyst-forecast-a-strong-bullish/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/29707242.jpeg

The crash, which included the massive liquidation of Curve Finance CEO’s lending positions, left many investors concerned. Whales took advantage of Curve’s struggle and loaded their bags with millions of tokens. Related Reading: Trump-Inspired Memecoins Crash 30% After Rumors Of Trump’s Official Token Launch Whales Go Shopping After CRV Dip On June 13, CRV price saw a massive drop and a high liquidation risk that alarmed the crypto community. As a result, Curve Finance’s native token reached a negative milestone after dropping nearly 40%. The token went from hovering between the $0.35-$0.37 price range to its new all-time low (ATL) of $0.20. Since then, Curve Finance’s team has worked to solve the issues and stabilize the token’s price. Over the weekend, the token started its recovery, reclaiming the $0.30 support level. However, CRV’s price fell below the support zone as the new week started, retracing to the $0.27-$0.29 levels. Curve continued its upward trajectory on Tuesday afternoon, printing nine hourly green candles. Nearly a week later, the token has bounced over 40% from the drop. After momentarily rising above the $0.355 mark today, CRV is currently trading around the $0.33 range. Despite investors’ concerns, whales took the opportunity to snatch CRV at a discounted price. On-chain analytics firm Spot On Chain revealed that six whales accumulated over 50 million CRV during the dip. Per the report, the whales bought 55.26 million Curve tokens, worth around $19.4 million. 5 of the 6 wallets are first-time accumulators, which made the first-time purchases of the token surge this week. Since the price recovery, the whales have made around 8%, or $1.43 million, in unrealized profit. The biggest gainer bought 4.34 million tokens at an average price of $0.288, representing a 21.84% ROI. Crypto Analysts Predict Rise To $2 Various market watchers have forecasted a bullish future for CRV’s price. As the price started to retest the $0.3 price range, crypto trader Follis suggested that Curve Finance’s token would perform remarkably. The trader says the token will ” be one of the first alts to pull a 2x off the lows.” He highlighted that the token’s “-40% nuke” was linked to Michael Egorov’s liquidation event. Additionally, he pointed out that in 5 days, the token had recovered nearly 50% of its price. Crypto analyst CrediBull stated that Curve Finance’s token has “already printed a clear 5 wave impulse.” To the analyst, this suggests that CRV is “structurally more bullish” than tokens like CVX. CrediBull forecasted a $2 target for the token based on this performance. Related Reading: ZkSync (ZK) Drops 20% Amid Binance Listing And New Token Distribution Program Another trader shared a similar opinion, stating that CRV is “looking good for some relief.” To Sanchez, the liquidation dip looked like the last leg down in a five-wave pattern.
