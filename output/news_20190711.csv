42430730,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxGfh,1562882456,Police in Spain Say Bitcoin ATMs Expose Problems in Europe's AML Laws,"Law enforcement officials in Spain are arguing that a recent effort to break up a criminal organization -- which utilized bitcoin ATMs -- has exposed a gap in European anti-money laundering statutes  An international case led by Europol and Spain's Civil Guard earlier this year uncovered the regulatory loopholes in crypto-related crimes in new AML regulations issued by the European Commission and that are set to be executed by next year, according to Bloomberg.  The criminal organization reportedly provided large-scale money laundering services using Bitcoin ATMs, which fall out of the current financial regulations, not covering either cash machines or cryptocurrency exchange platforms.  Civil Guard officials reportedly disclosed that the criminals obtained two ATMs machines from trading platforms and installed them in Madrid as part of a fake remittance and trading services office. After sending funds to the ATMs using exchanges, the group would then insert cash in the machines to receive a QR code to claim cryptocurrency from those exchanges. They would then give those funds to drug traffickers in Colombia.  Now, Spanish officials must prove the link between the Bitcoin ATMs and the confiscated digital funds during the operation -- a difficult feat without the aid of crypto-specific regulation or European law guidelines regarding this type of crime.  Spain's gray area  Nonetheless, the regulatory picture in Spain is beginning to take firmer shape, especially in light of a recent court determination.  This week the Supreme Court of Spain dictated that bitcoin is not money. The legal precedent was set in a fraud case where claimants demanded to have their bitcoins reimbursed, having the initial value of their investment returned in euros instead.  The ruling was based in regulations from 2011, which state that digital money is ""the monetary value stored in electronic or magnetic means that represent a credit over the issuer"".  According to the entity, bitcoin lacks the legal consideration of money, being classified as a "" patrimonial immaterial asset"" subjected to supply and market demand.

Propshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/props-launches-first-sec-approved-163000064.html  is an ethereum-based blockchain token that integrates with streaming platforms like YouNow and XSplit to reward users and creators with tokens.  YouNow – which developed the Props blockchain – announced today that it will begin rewarding content creators with Props for in-app activities that “drive community engagement.” Users will also begin to receive tokens for engaging with the platform. YouNow will begin by distributing a total of 187 million tokens to users and creators, according to an SEC filing.  The video-streaming firm will incentive users to earn Props by offering VIP status and boosting their purchasing power of an in-app currency called Bars. Exclusive items and discounts will also be on offer to Props holders.  Reg A+ is a way to reward early investors, as well as galvanize users around a product by giving them a vested interest. At launch each token was valued at $0.1369, according to the filing. However, as the platform grows, demand for the tokens may rise, and token holders may earn a profit. This incentives Props holders to develop the network.  Additionally, tokens are transferable between different applications and wallets, though they cannot be exchanged for fiat currencies. At this point, there are four applications that have integrated with the token network.  TechCrunch  reported that Props worked with the SEC for two years before receiving approval to ensure they weren’t misleading investors or inappropriately raising capital.  In fact, the company pre-sold $22 million worth of tokens to investors like Union Square Ventures, Comcast, and Venrock, among others. At the time, the company wrote, ""Pending other uses, we intend to invest the proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit, direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government, cryptoassets or hold as cash,"" in its SEC Edgar filing. Though that language was removed from the most recent filing.  The SEC also recently granted the first Reg A+ qualification to a token sale for Blockstack's $28 million offering on CoinList.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan’s top financial watchdog, told crypto news site Bitcoin.com that 110 exchanges are in “various stages of registration.”  In 2018, the FSA, did not grant approval for any crypto exchanges to begin operating in the country. The year prior, the agency had approved 16 new exchanges.  Additionally, in 2018 the FSA began issuing “improvement orders” to preempt potential cases of fraud or KYC noncompliance and started conducting on-site inspections.  “BitFlyer, amongst other top exchanges in Japan, received the improvement order based on a changing regulatory climate in Japan,” a bitFlyer representative said. The company voluntarily stopped opening domestic customer accounts for those looking to join the platform, as it worked to meet the FSA’s stricter identification requirements.  Now it appears the climate is changing again.  On July 3, bitFlyer announced it would resume processing new accounts. Additionally, according to Bitcoin.com, in the first six months of 2019, the FSA has granted approval to 3 additional crypto exchanges, bringing the total amount of operators to 19.  While details for the majority of applications for new crypto exchanges are scant, Bitcoin.com reports many are in a preliminary stage.  If approved, these exchanges will need to comply with newly introduced obligations in the Payments Services Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, enacted by the Japanese legislature on March 31 to take effect in April, 2020.  The acts introduce expensive licensing fees as well as extensive protocols for data protection, customer on-boarding, and custodial safeguarding.

42430733,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxGth,1562869241,Bitcoin's Price Charts Point to an Impending 'Golden Cross',"A bitcoin price indicator is about to turn bullish for the first time since the early stages of the 2016-17 bull market.  The 50-candle moving average (MA) on bitcoin's three-day chart is in a solid upward trajectory and looks set to cross above the 200-candle MA in the next few days.  That would be the first golden crossover on the three-day chart since early February 2016. CoinDesk reported on a golden cross for bitcoin's daily chart back in April.  Seasoned traders often refer to that long-term bull market signal as a lagging indicator. After all, the MA studies are based on historical data and tend to lag prices, which also means they have limited predictive abilities at best.  While that is true for most crossovers, the one that is about to happen on the three-day chart has proved its mettle as a reliable bull market indicator in the past.  3-day chart (2016-2017)  The 50- and 200-candle MAs produced a bullish crossover in three days to Feb. 3, 2016, following which bitcoin’s price charted its way to a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.  A closer look at the chart reveals that the low of $360 printed a few weeks before the golden crossover was never put to test again. In fact, the 50-candle MA consistently reversed pullbacks (marked by arrows) throughout the rise from $360 (February 2016 low) to the record high of $20,000.  What’s more, the bullish crossover happened five months ahead of the mining reward halving of July 2016 and 13 months after bitcoin bottomed out near $150.  This time the MAs are about to produce a bull cross at least three quarters ahead of the reward halving, due sometime in May 2020, and seven months after the bear market ran out of steam near $3,100.  3-day chart (2019)  As of writing, the upward sloping (bullish) 50-candle MA is located at $6,566 and the 200-candle MA is flatlined at $7,438.  The golden crossover will likely happen before the month end, unless prices drop all the way back to $5,000, dragging the 50-candle MA lower. That, however, is unlikely to happen anytime soon.  If history is a guide, then the confirmation of the golden crossover could be followed by a rally to record highs above $20,000. Further, throughout the rally, the 50-candle MA will likely serve as strong support.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42430721,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxGXh,1562867248,ConsenSys May Finally Fix Its 'Chaotic' Employee Equity Situation,"Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, head of the Brooklyn-based venture studio ConsenSys, is moving to appease employees who say they're fed up with unfulfilled promises about equity disbursements.  Out of seven current or former ConsenSys employees interviewed by CoinDesk, four said they felt misled about the company’s employee share options. Although most employees are verbally and contractually promised they will soon have an opportunity to obtain ConsenSys shares, few receive it or are able to use it, said the sources, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.  Now, after a year of discontent, ConsenSys is imminently expected to announce an official policy regarding employee share options, according to one of the sources. ConsenSys declined to comment for this article. We will update if we hear back.  “People would bring it up in town halls and Joe would say, ‘We’re working on it,’” one source said about Lubin's repeated verbal assurances. “I didn’t know how important equity was or that I should fight for it. I definitely felt taken advantage of in that sense.”  With regard to shares for ConsenSys proper, which slightly over 100 early employees have allegedly received but few have tried to sell, another source who did receive equity added:  “If there’s no public offering and there’s no buyback program from the company, then that equity is not valuable.”  According to one source with knowledge of the matter, Lubin owns more than half of the equity in ConsenSys proper, in addition to ownership stakes in the firm's incubated startups. The source said Lubin is shopping a tenth of that ConsenSys equity around to potential investors such as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.  As such, few shareholders believe Lubin will be able to close this raise without diluting the value of employee shares or substituting ConsenSys equity for shares in the “spokes,” i.e. incubated projects. It remains to be seen how employee share options will be finalized in writing.  “They’ll have to set up more shares in the company or set up different entities and give people shares in other entities,” one source told CoinDesk. “Promising people spoke equity for spokes that have never launched and don’t have the ability to raise capital, because of the way the cap table is structured, is not valuable.”  As CoinDesk previously reported, some incubated projects have struggled to attract investors due to Lubin retaining the majority share in the nascent startups. (To be fair, one startup that recently managed to spin out despite the equity debacle, 3Box, raised $2.5 million from venture capital firms including Placeholder and CoinFund.)  On the other hand, one current employee had a more optimistic view of the company “maturing” through this equity reconfiguration.  “We get paid on time, when we have issues with bonuses we’re able to resolve them in a timely manner,” he said. “I think [employee share options] will be fair. I’m under no illusions. Given how much we’ve grown, that will result in dilution.”  Chaotic mesh  Out of the seven current and former ConsenSys employees CoinDesk interviewed for this article, six believed the disorganized compensation system is “highly political” and leads to unfair distribution.  Some people work across various projects in “the mesh” and earn bonuses, equity, opportunities or tokens from each.  “It’s chaos, there’s no clear line of authority or accountability,” one former employee told CoinDesk.  Six sources said some ConsenSys executives took advantage of this system to siphon compensation from incubated projects without contributing significant value. The sole dissenter conceded this was happening with a few “short-term” incentives like extra bonuses, but didn’t believe this issue was widespread across the company.  Another source said they weren't disappointed by the lack of equity, although they added the younger and less experienced employees were “definitely” misled in their onboarding process.  “Nobody is keeping track of these things,” the employee said, referring to who is owed what. “They’ve never gotten to the point where they could make good on that offer.”  The company has seen three executive departures in recent months and rumors continue to swirl about current employees frustrated with disorganization.  “What’s woefully incompetent is the continued promise of equity,” one source who did receive equity told CoinDesk. “Some folks have spoke equity in spokes they don’t even work for. It’s chaotic. There’s no reason to it.”  ConsenSys office photo via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/07/11/consensys-may-finally-fix-its-chaotic-employee-equity-situation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afab1622d5cfea0e2e83e25064e2676b13f88563-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mbatha  ’s company, Bitcoin Wallet, promised investors 100-percent returns by investing South African rand in cryptocurrencies. Before shutting down the operation on July 4, Mbatha was believed to have been taking in more than R2 million, approximately $140,000, in cash deposits per day.  On July 9, Mbatha appeared on Nqubeko FM in Ladysmith to explain that some investor’s accounts had been compromised by a phishing scam. In an earlier radio appearance he had said Bitcoin Wallets had “no cash to pay out.”  That evening, rumors circulated through social media that Mbatha had been arrested, leading to a 200 person crowd gathering in front of Ladysmith police station, demanding to see the Bitcoin Wallet's manager. Tensions were high, as investors had reportedly been unable to contact Mbatha since the company shuttered. One investor was pleading for the crowd not overreact:  The following morning, reports indicated Mbatha had not been arrested, as the police could “only act if investors open cases against the Bitcoin Wallets manager.”  Wednesday afternoon, another crowd formed around Mbatha's home, presumably to speak to the manager. Following the home's ignition, a TimesLIVE spoke to an anonymous person on the scene who said that angry investors were seeking vigilante justice.  It is unknown how many Ladysmith citizens invested in the operation, but at one point Mbatha stopped taking deposits less than R5,000.  Police uploaded a complaints affidavit ""for those who have lost money in the scheme. ""The completed form should then be handed in at the Ladysmith police station, together with your Bitcoin Wallets receipt, and a copy of your ID,"" they wrote.  As it stands, Mbatha appears to be on the run.

Partners include Amazon, Deloitte, and Fidelity, as well as crypto data firm Messari, the Ethereum Foundation, the Stellar Foundation, among others, to build on the distributed web incubator that IDEO CoLab launched in February.  The new initiative will see each of the partners hosting acceleration programs to provide enterprising blockchain entrepreneurs and firms with the tools and funding they need to further the ""development, adoption, and impact of blockchain technology,"" said Ian Lee, managing director at IDEO CoLab Ventures.  IDEO CoLab believes blockchain gives “users greater access, ownership, and control” over their identities and financial lives, but remains “highly unusable for the average person.” Nearly every facet of the tech, from wallets to key management, and distribution mechanisms to custodianship, are “wide open” to be improved upon, the firm said.  What’s more, it expects the advancements being made in blockchain to develop into “billion — or even trillion — dollar opportunities.""  It's not only the blockchain industry IDEO CoLab is accelerating, but also the nature of startup incubation.  Lee said:  In comparison to traditional startup accelerators or incubators, IDEO CoLab’s Startup Studio unbundles the startup accelerator model into half and full day workshops run by IDEO and our network of partners focused on a highly specialized need – like product validation, brand design, hiring, user testing, or conflict management. That way, entrepreneurs and startups can quickly get the help they need when they need it, then go back to their home offices to keep building great companies, teams, and protocols.  The studio programs on offer include an IDEO brand design workshop, an organization scaling workshop with Electric Capital, and a legal and regulatory workshop with law firm Perkins Coie.  Longer term residencies, based in either San Francisco or Boston, will range from three to six months alongside IDEO CoLab's approximately 20 person team.  'Sustainable model'  IDEO began working with startups in 2012, after 21 years of successful design for international corporations such as Apple, Walgreens, and 3M.  It continued to support underdogs when tilting towards distributed web technologies in 2015. Since that time, IDEO has collaborated on over 30 blockchain protocols, co-created 12, and invested in 9 burgeoning startups, including IPFS, ZeppelinOS, Augur, Zcash, Handshake and Grin.  Additionally, the company is looking to invest in approximately 12 new blockchain initiatives every year going forward. The accelerator’s success is seen by the reflexive investment from one of IDEO’s first early stage collaborations – Messari, which has joined Startup Studio.  Lee said:  ""We believe we’ve found a sustainable model to support early-stage entrepreneurs, and that our approach and value will lead the best founders to deepen their relationship and align incentives with us.""  Indeed, IDEO has had repeated collaborations with most of the companies in its portfolio, including some that began long before they invested, according to Lee.  Startup Studio has received support from Atrium, Avanta Ventures, Blockchain at Berkeley, Brex, CoinList, CSAA Insurance Group, Electric, GS Group, Hanwha, NEAR Protocol, Oasis Labs, she256, Silicon Valley Bank and Tezos Foundation, in addition to the names listed above.

The most senior position to be filled is that of a leading solution architect with a rank of vice president, who will be serving as a chief technology officer for the digital assets unit. The new VP will be responsible for the ""design, architecture and delivery of a new platform, maintenance of existing platforms"" and compliance with Fidelity's cyber security and technology standards.  The successful candidate should have a ""practical experience developing on public blockchain platforms such as bitcoin or ethereum, and/or experience with private blockchain platforms,"" the job description says.

The candidate should have experience with institutional customers, securities trading and custody, ""as well as the operational and regulatory constructs around them.""  Also sought is a product designer to define the digital assets unit's product strategy regarding ""usability, interaction design, business strategy, and user research.""

As reported by the South China Morning Post, former People's Bank of China (PBoC) governor Zhou Xiaochuan said at an event in Beijing this week that, with its Libra offering, Facebook had shown that there is potential for a “strong"" global cryptocurrency that can be exchanged for fiat currencies.  While Libra may help developing countries improve their payment systems, Zhou said, it would also pose a threat to existing cross-border payments systems and could weaken national currencies.    He said:      “Libra has introduced a concept that will impact the traditional cross-border business and payment system.""              In the face of this new risk, even if not a major one for China, the government should “make good preparations and make the Chinese yuan a stronger currency,” according to Zhou.    One way forward would be to enable non-specified ""commercial entities"" to issue digital yuans, as Hong Kong allows with its dollar.  The system in Hong Kong allows several banks to issue HKD banknotes backed by U.S. dollar reserves, while the de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, works to maintain a peg to USD.    The Post spoke to a senior analyst at Orient Securities, Chen Dafei, who said he interpreted the comments as meaning that major tech firms like Alibaba and Tencent – which have already built out sizable payments networks – could potentially take part in the issuance of a national digital currency.              Previously, when in charge of the PBoC, Zhou backed the work on developing China's digital currency, saying at one time that its launch is ""inevitable."" While that work has been ongoing for at least several years, there have been no signs of an impending launch.      If Libra goes ahead, despite all the regulatory issues it's currently facing, that may be set to change.

42430725,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxGhh,1562850048,Wala Was Africa's Perfect Crypto Success Story – Until It Collapsed,"For a moment, it worked as planned. As CoinDesk reported last summer, a user in South Africa could pay their mom’s electricity bill in Uganda using a crypto-powered payments app called Wala.  But despite early traction in facilitating remittances and other small payments for Africa’s underbanked, Wala was effectively broke by early 2019, laying off its staff and closing access to the company’s flagship app in February.  CEO Tricia Martinez published a blog post in June attributing the company’s hardships to Africa’s poor infrastructure. In a recent interview with Decrypt, Wala co-founder Samer Saab also claimed new Ugandan regulations and unreliable internet infrastructure sparked an exodus of users from the nascent platform.  But three sources with knowledge of the company’s operations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, tell quite a different story.  They told CoinDesk that Martinez spent funds from 2017's $1.2 million initial coin offering (ICO) on expensive equipment and international travel, as well as posh accommodations like a spacious office in Cape Town.  CoinDesk was able to confirm there were active user accounts at the time of the shutdown. However, since Wala lacked a revenue model, the company quickly burned through its resources, regardless of an earlier $1 million seed round raised from investors like Vinny Lingham's Newtown Partners.  Wala employed roughly eight staffers in South Africa, had a network of ""ambassadors"" and had struck partnerships with local payment processors across Africa so that customers could cash out in fiat if needed.  In terms of hiring local and producing a live product for underbanked users through brands they already trusted, Wala checked all the boxes.  “This is the story of average entrepreneurs,” one of the sources told CoinDesk. “Our path to revenue was too uncertain to convince any investors [of follow-on investment].”  Llew Claasen of Newtown Partners told CoinDesk: ""Crypto market conditions in 2018 didn't help them and they ran out of money before they could close a new round."" He added: ""Startups are brutal.""  Further, CoinDesk’s reporting has confirmed that the user numbers previously promoted by the startup were exaggerated.  While Martinez’s blog post claims Wala had “150,000 users,” one anonymous source estimated the number was closer to 2,000 individuals with numerous wallets. Every wallet was able to claim a small token reward during setup, so dozens of users created numerous accounts. Only several hundred people were actually using the Wala app for its intended purpose, the source said.  The source estimated that roughly 300 users did not get their funds back, based on defunct wallets that still have tokens inside. One Ugandan user told CoinDesk that although she lost around $21 in the debacle because she was not warned about the startup’s closure, learning about cryptocurrency for the first time was a positive experience.  Several sources contradicted Martinez’s narrative by saying that insolvency, not infrastructure or faulty partners, led to the company’s collapse.  “I do not believe their behavior was from a place of malice,” one anonymous source said. “They just got way out of their depth and handled it poorly.  Startup tribulations  Serving users with limited digital literacy and mobile access can be challenging, especially when a startup needs to communicate with users en masse.  The grassroots growth strategy of relying on independent Ugandan ambassadors backfired when word-of-mouth education about the shutdown didn’t spread as far as the signup scheme.  Another anonymous source said the startup claimed the difficulties were caused by “maintenance” even after the shutdown process was well under way. The Wala website is still online today and Martinez’s Twitter account highlights 2018 photos of the disbanded Wala team.  Martinez tweeted on June 23 that Wala plans to raise money and relaunch with a more sustainable model. Martinez and her co-founder Saab did not respond to CoinDesk's requests for comment.  Chatter on the Wala Telegram group, with complaints from now non-responsive accounts, support the anonymous sources’ narrative. The Ugandan user also confirmed that she received no warning that the app was shutting down.  “The majority of users have no Telegram, Twitter or WhatsApp. So for them to speak up is virtually impossible. Hence why no one has heard anything,” one anonymous source said. “People were trying to withdraw money, but they were unable to since we have not topped up our balance with the cash-out provider.”  Regardless of what the future holds, the Wala case illustrates how token-centric startups are subject to the requirements of everyday businesses. Wala’s technical solution worked on a limited scale and quickly garnered modest traction, but it also required profits to grow.  And even if they are eager to learn about cryptocurrency, marginalized users are rarely a source of quick revenue.  “Wala has never been exploitive. I believe they have the interest of Ugandans at heart and we could have changed their lives,” one anonymous source said. “A model could have been worked out.”  Wala image via Tricia Martinez/Twitter",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/11/wala-was-africas-perfect-crypto-success-story-until-it-collapsed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c0b0556623d4f69cfb6998d248529b37896e49d-900x652.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The investment takes the form of a $1.5 million seed round in data startup Textile.  Launching on the surface as a decentralized answer to Flickr, Textile has a larger mission: to help users control their own data by using the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is an open protocol built by Protocol Labs, the same company that created the Filecoin ICO.  ""IPFS's story is under-shared, in my opinion,"" Textile co-founder and CEO Andrew Hill told CoinDesk. ""It's one of the greatest inventions of the past decade and has already proven its value in countless real-world examples.""  IPFS creates a new architecture for the web where data is stored by its content rather than its location, which means that multiple copies can be located around the world making the web more efficient. It also makes data less prone to disappearing when a link goes dead.  BlueYard, which led Textile's round, is already an investor in Protocol Labs and other applications that rely on IPFS.  BlueYard co-founder Ciarán O'Leary told CoinDesk in an email:  ""We think the internet would be better if we were to re-think it away from the server-client model and create a web where apps would permission data from users, versus the other way around.""  O'Leary noted that for as good as the underlying technology is, the web needs software like Textile's to improve its user experience.  Multicoin's Kyle Samani told CoinDesk that his company believes in Web3 and sees that one of its first needs is for a data storage solution. He called Textile an ""iCloud for Web3,"" adding, ""Textile is one of the most perfect examples of a Web3 developer tooling infrastructure play.""  For both Multicoin and Collaborative Fund, this is their first IPFS-related investment. Collaborative's Taylor Greene told CoinDesk in an email that his firm was already interested in investments that would return data control to internet users.  ""Textile is the most elegant solution that we've seen in that space,"" Greene said.  Interested users can join the waiting list now to use Textile's own photos app, which demonstrates the fundamental functionality of the software. Hill told CoinDesk that Textile ""makes it possible for users to own their data, and share (or revoke) that data with trusted applications – or anyone else for that matter.""

It even comes with dramatic fight music.  The debate was about security and scalability where Hayes calls for more financial privacy while Roubini sees the whole system - the ""experiment called bitcoin"" - as corrupt and ridiculous.  ""Law enforcement authorities prefer transactions on bitcoin,"" said Roubini, arguing that bitcoin is not private or decentralized.  The arguments are strong but on par with the normal back and forth found online. Hayes feels that the parties associated with maintaining the infrastructure - the miners - won't attack each other because their investments will fall to zero while Roubini calls cold storage ""Paleolithic,"" noting that you have to worry about rats eating your private key. Neither can agree.  Was the video worth waiting for? Sure, it shows two sides of the crypto debate intelligently espoused by two true believers who are invested in the success or failure of the system.  The real winner? Moderator Andrew Neil who hushed Roubini during a longer harangue.

42430732,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxGvh,1562843451,Bitcoin Price Drops $2K in 24 Hours but Bull View Still Intact,"View  Bitcoin suffered a significant drop in the last 24 hours, but the higher-lows pattern on the daily chart is still intact and the outlook remains bullish.  A daily close below the July 2 low of $9,615 would invalidate the bullish higher-lows pattern and confirm a bearish reversal.  The case for a drop to $9,615 would strengthen if BTC prints a UTC close below $11,550 today, validating Wednesday’s bearish outside day candle.  A high-volume wedge breakout on the hourly chart, if confirmed, would imply an end of the pullback and yield a move back above $12,000.  Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped sharply in the last 24 hours, however, the outlook remains bullish with prices holding well above key support near $9,600.  The top cryptocurrency by market value ran into a flood of offers near $13,200 yesterday and fell to a low of $11,164 on Bitstamp earlier today.  Media outlets have associated the sharp pullback with the US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments that Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra ""cannot go forward"" until serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability are addressed.  While there is no concrete evidence to link bitcoin’s drop with Powell’s comments, the price action does paint a picture that indicates the sell-off was triggered by Powell’s remarks.  As noted by CNBC Journalist Ryan Browne, BTC began falling rapidly from $12,900 immediately after Powell started talking on Libra at 14:30 UTC yesterday.  That said, the bulls were already looking tired, having faced multiple rejections above $13,100 ahead of Powell’s testimony, as noted by CoinDesk Markets, meaning the pullback was expected. Powell's remarks may have ended up deepening the price slide.  Looking forward, the outlook will remain bullish as long as the price is held above the higher low of $9,615 created on July 2. Renowned crypto market analyst Tone Vays mentioned $10,000 as the level to defend for the bulls.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,500 on Bitstamp, representing a 10 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  BTC created a bearish outside day candle on Wednesday, which occurs when the day begins with buyers in control only to end on a bearish note, engulfing the high and low of the preceding day.  A bearish outside day is widely considered an early warning of a bullish-to-bearish trend change. The reversal, however, is confirmed only if prices close below the candle’s low on the following day.  The focus, therefore, is on today’s UTC close. The bearish outside day pattern would gain credence if prices print a close below $11,550.  That would shift risk in favor of a drop to the bullish higher low of $9,615 (July 2 low). The outlook would turn bearish only if and when the price finds acceptance below that level.  BTC, however, could close well above $11,550 today as the pullback seen in the last 24 hours has taken the shape of a bullish reversal pattern, as seen in the chart below.  Hourly chart  BTC looks to have created a falling wedge pattern, which comprises of contracting trendlines connecting lower highs and lower lows.  The contraction of the range indicates sellers are losing steam. As a result, a wedge breakout is considered a bullish reversal pattern.  A high-volume break above the upper edge of the wedge, currently at $11,500 would confirm a breakout and allow a rally back to immediate resistance at $12,200 (horizontal line). A violation there would expose Wednesday’s high of $13,200.

The Canadian government published the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act in the Canada Gazette on Wednesday.  While the changes to the financial rules – finalized late last month – cover a number of perceived gaps within traditional finance, they also notably set the bar higher for platforms ""dealing in virtual currency."" The government explained that such activities include ""virtual currency exchange services and value transfer services.""  The rules now class both Canadian and foreign crypto platforms as money servicing businesses (MSBs), which must ""fulfill all obligations, including implementing a full compliance program and registering with FINTRAC [the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada].""  Further, any ""reporting entity"" across all sectors that receives CA$10,000 (US$7,667) or over in cryptocurrency – such as deposits received or in payment – must record details of the transaction, identify the sender and report the transaction.  The government said:  ""These amendments serve to mitigate the money laundering and terrorist activity financing vulnerabilities of virtual currency in a way that is consistent with the existing legal framework, while not unduly hindering innovation. For this reason, the amendments are targeted at persons or entities engaged in the business of dealing in virtual currencies, and not virtual currencies themselves.""  The news comes months after Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX shocked the country and made global headlines after its founder and CEO Gerald Cotten died late last year, apparently without passing on access to the company's cryptocurrency wallets.

A collection of four major cryptocurrency exchanges – Gemini, bitFlyer, Bittrex, and Bitstamp – in collaboration with commercial consultants, law firms, and compliance experts are working to establish a self-regulatory organization (SRO) for the cryptocurrency industry.  The organization has launched six committees to write white papers that delineate industry best practices concerning the Bank Secrecy Act and know your customer procedures, custody and security issues, enforcement protocols, insurance standards, market integrity, and taxation, according to a statement. These measures are made in anticipation of a potential congressional hearing that would affirm the VCA as a self-regulating watchdog.  Yusuf Hussain, VCA President, said the consortium is already “in conversation with supportive regulatory bodies,” and has identified the industry challenges of most concern for the regulatory community.  Each committee will focus on areas where there is still regulatory uncertainty. That being for each branch:  BSA/AML — how to apply Bank Secrecy Act and Know Your Customer controls, including blockchain analytics and transaction monitoring.  Custody and Security —how to implement and maintain current best practices for cryptocurrency custodianship.  Enforcement — how to execute the regulatory policies and procedures established by the VCA and respond to customer concerns and complaints.  Insurance — how to establish minimum, appropriate insurances and coverages for cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians.  Market Integrity — how to facilitate cross-market information sharing, surveillance, and auditing to detect and deter manipulative and fraudulent activity.  Tax — how to establish a tax framework and interpretation of tax code law as it relates to cryptocurrency trading.  By pairing each committee with industry leaders steeped in regulatory knowledge, the VCA aims to develop “well-informed, sensible regulation.”  Additionally, representatives from Navigant Consulting and Perkins Coie will work as advisors alongside each committee.  “The VCA is grateful to the individuals and companies willing to commit their time towards these committees and advance the goals of the VCA in fostering consumer protection and market integrity for the virtual currency industry,” said Hailey Lennon, Secretary of the VCA, in a statement.  “These committees directly address the concerns of regulators that are trying to figure out the crypto space,” Hussain said. He added that the VCA is “not a replacement for but a supplement to traditional regulatory bodies.”  Collaboration with traditional finance  Modeled after FINRA, the VCA will collaborate with traditional financial operators to leverage their expertise when developing practices and standards to better oversee and surveil cryptocurrency markets as well as design appropriate consumer protections.  Hussain said the relationship between traditional finance and crypto does not precisely map, adding that the “Federal government sees challenges in a fast paced, innovative environment.”  “Regulation has to keep that same pace,” he said. Through its commingling of traditional and crypto firms, Hussain said the VCA in a position to “facilitate cross-market information sharing” and curb market manipulation and other fraudulent activities in real time.  By demonstrating a commitment to progress as well as consumer protections, the VCA hopes to “enable crypto becoming mainstream” and entice more, and larger institutions into the field.  In order to become a registered SRO, the VCA will require congressional approval. “Once a good set of standards is in place, we can take those to congress,” said Hussain.  The VCA was founded in 2018 and is open to all U.S. digital asset platforms and custodians.

The firm revealed that margin trading was on the way in late May, and said that the service would feature up to 20x leverage soon after.  In an announcement Thursday, Binance indicated that leverage (the amount that can be borrowed against a user's crypto collateral) is just 3x, however.  ""Your Margin Wallet balance determines the amount of funds you can borrow, following a fixed rate of 3:1 (3x). So if you have 1 BTC, you can borrow 2 more,"" the firm said in a tutorial.  It also set out that to use the service, traders must have passed a know-your-customer ID check and must have two-factor authentication set up as an extra layer of security.  Margin trading is available in pairs including bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), XRP, Binance coin (BNB), Tron (TRX) and tether (USDT) initially, but can be funded with all supported coins on Binance. Fees are 0.02 percent on all except BNB, which invites 0.01 percent.  “Though the current cryptocurrency market and legacy platforms for margin trading poses greater risks and benefits at the same time, we are confident that its development coupled with more knowledge on proper risk management will help realize greater benefits in the long run,” said Binance co-founder Yi He.  As for the version 2.0 of its platform, the exchange said that, as well as a ""newly optimized interface,"" it also features an advanced trading engine aimed to improve order matching.  It further allows users to move funds from their margin wallet to their primary Binance wallet with no transaction fees.  Addressing the addition of margin trading, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said:  ""This is another step in providing an inclusive cryptocurrency trading platform catering to the needs of both advanced institutional traders and retail traders under the same roof. We are providing a new tool in the financial services and cryptocurrency markets to help amplify trading results of successful trades.""

42430723,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxGdh,1562819420,Oil Giant Shell Invests in Startup That Uses Blockchain Tech for Energy Tracking,"A U.S.-based blockchain startup working to ""democratize the energy industry"" has raised an undisclosed sum from oil multinational Shell and Japanese business giant Sumitomo Corporation Group.  In an announcement published on Wednesday, LO3 Energy said it has developed a ""transactive energy platform"" to address the challenge of tracking energy from different sources across supply networks.  “As we move into a less carbonized future, Shell aims to invest in innovative companies that will help enable the energy transition. LO3 Energy fits right in that space,” said Kirk Coburn, investment director at Shell Ventures.  With LO3's system, a mobile app enables users to choose from different local energy resources and further allows them to select a specific supplier.  While the electricity passes through the power grid as normal, a ""private, permissioned blockchain"" tracks the details of the energy source and the purchase agreement.  According to its white paperhttps://exergy.energy/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Exergy-Whitepaper-v8.pdf, LO3's ""Exergy"" blockchain is aimed to ""facilitate the optimal coupling of local electric generation to parties that can value, procure, store and utilize this generation most efficiently. The resulting transactions will clear within a participative market-driven environment operating as close to the grid edge as possible, with an increasing level of automation by using self-executing contracts on a distributed ledger.""  The company said its product could power a range of business use cases, including ""peer-to-peer energy trading, energy hedging for businesses, virtual power plants, dynamic electric vehicle charging and demand response.""  The startup's CEO Lawrence Orsini said:  “Energy is going through a revolution with renewable distributed energy resources increasingly picking up market share – but to integrate them efficiently we need to re-invent our energy networks.”  LO3 has previously garnered investments from Braemar Energy Ventures, Centrica, and tech giant Siemens.

From around 14:00 UTC on July 10, BTC shed $962 from its price tag in a little over an hour, landing just above the $12,000 psychological support before another wave of sellers dragged it to a peak low of $11,550.  Prices had initially attempted to rally above $13,200 but were stopped short as a quick reversal to momentum brought prices reeling back below $12,000.  BTC’s price has since recovered slightly and is currently changing hands at $11,813.  The move down was also accompanied by a large surge in total trading volume of $3.8 billion over a 24-hour period as traders looked to book profit and exit the markets in quick succession amid declining crypto prices across the board, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Major names such as ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), XRP (XRP) and EOS (EOS) also began to fall in value at around the same time as BTC, losing between 6-11 percent in just under 4-hours.  Further, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined suffered a $27.1 billion loss over 24-hours, marking one of the largest single-day losses in market value since June 28, 2019.
