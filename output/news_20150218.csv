42378010,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LriT,1424302245,Canada Looks for Bitcoin Exchange Leader Amid Market Turmoil,"Four bitcoin exchanges was too many, according to Dave Bradley, the operator of Calgary-based over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin brokerage Bitcoin Brains.  Bradley is referring to CAVIRTEX, Cointrader, Quadriga CX and Vault of Satoshi, what had been the four exchanges serving the Canadian market at the start of 2015. In the last two months, however, both CAVIRTEX and Vault of Satoshi, the market’s oldest and arguably most visible bitcoin trading platforms, abruptly closed.  The sudden shutdown of CAVIRTEX, in particular, has caught much of Canada’s bitcoin ecosystem by surprise, the notice following on the heels of the decision by the province of Quebec to require licensing for bitcoin trading platforms, a move that further thrust regulation in the country into uncertainty.  Adam O’Brien, president of BTC Solutions, a Vancouver-based leveraged trading platform, downplayed that the events were likely to have much of an effect on bitcoin consumers, even if the bitcoin business sector is likely to see shake-ups.  O’Brien told CoinDesk:  “Consumers use bitcoin because they like bitcoin. If they have to buy from an ATM, an exchange or OTC it won't matter.”  This sentiment was echoed by Leo Dominguez, CEO of bitcoin ATM operator BitSent, who nonetheless spoke to the impact the closure would have in the market.  “It takes away from the legitimacy of bitcoin, CAVIRTEX was one of the longest standing exchanges in the world, three-and-a-half years is a long time,” Dominguez said.  Elsewhere there was agreement that though the exchange closure wouldn’t bring positive publicity to the industry, it would at least create new opportunities.  Thrust into spotlight  Initial signs are Canada-based bitcoin users are migrating their accounts to other available offerings, with both Quadriga and Cointrader reporting they’ve seen an uptick in new accounts. Although, this hasn’t yet translated to volume due to the fact that new customers are still filing through the enrollment process.  Cointrader COO Mitchell Demeter suggested that his exchange has seen a 300% increase in new sign-ups in the last 24 hours. Cointrader launched its order-book exchange in late 2014, and is currently offer zero-fee trading through April  Gerald Cotten, CEO of Quadriga, indicated that its verification processes were likely to stem trading volume for a few days, though he noted his exchange had seen an increase.  “It is likely that Quadriga's trading volumes will increase later this week as we continue to absorb clients from CAVIRTEX,” he added.  Quadriga charges a 0.5% fee on all completed trades.  Stepping up  Both Quadriga and Cointrader indicated in statements that they intended to vie to become Canada’s leading exchange, and that they were likely to benefit from an increase in liquidity in absence of major competitors.  Demeter stressed Cointrader’s comparably long history, as the exchange, together with bitcoin ATM provider Robocoin, launched what is considered the world’s first bitcoin ATM in 2013.  “We built a fairly long track record. We have a lot of relationships and support from the community,” Demeter said, adding that his exchange uses CrowdCurity to ensure its security, and insures customer deposits through a partnership with bitcoin security specialist Xapo.  Cotten, in turn, spoke to Quadriga’s security strengths, noting that the exchange uses multi-signature cold storage to secure bitcoin holdings. Fiat holdings, he continued, are held at unspecified Canadian financial institutions.  “Quadriga takes security seriously, and employs a number of policies and procedures to ensure that both client information and client funds remain completely safe,” he said.  Lingering questions  Though both exchanges are competing for increased attention, members of the local market were quick to weigh in on which option they might prefer.  At press time, Bradley was still debating which exchange Bitcoin Brains might leverage, but reported he was reasonably confident in either choice.  “Well both of the remaining exchanges seem pretty good, professionally run, which one we send our volume to will probably depend on price and liquidity,” he said.  Dominguez pointed to the longstanding banking issues in the ecosystem as evidence neither might be able to prosper in the long run.  “People want bitcoin but we’re having problems running businesses due to banking relationships,” he said. “We need to fix the banking issue in Canada.”  Bradley agreed that this would mean the market is likely to see further turbulence, adding: “I think it was pretty inevitable, hopefully the market can support two exchanges.”  Limited impact to existing services  As the recent Bitstamp hack attested, an offline exchange has effects in the wider bitcoin ecosystem. However, in the case of CAVIRTEX, local companies suggested they weren’t as impacted by the sudden stop in services.  BTC Solutions, for example, operates ATMs but indicated that it uses Quadriga as a source of liquidity. BitAccess, a leading bitcoin ATM manufacturer that has been active in the Canadian market, also suggested its operators were impacted, but that they would be able to easily transition their operations.  “We are agnostic to any exchange and will switch our operators to another exchange,” co-founder Haseeb Awan said. “BitAccess works with many exchanges and it is up to operator to pick the exchange of his or her choice. Being in Canada and our relationship, CAVIRTEX was choice for multiple operators.”  CAVIRTEX indicated it has since sold all of its 10 bitcoin ATMs to BitSent, a company is seeking to operate 20 such machines across Canada. BitSent reported no disruption as it draws from an internal pool of liquidity, though it has now switched to Quadriga.  “We have been affected by the CAVIRTEX shut down but thankfully we have alternatives setup just in case,” Dominguez said.  Seizing opportunity  In the absence of these major names, however, other local entrepreneurs expressed an interest in entering the market, or suggested new companies may seek to capitalize on what they called the current opportunity.  Demeter acknowledged that the biggest threat to Cointrader would be from outside competition, but noted its experience and relationships with local banks as an advantage.  “Operating an exchange here is very difficult,” he said. “We’ve built relationships here to operate an exchange successfully so for someone coming into the market, [new customers would] be better off with us because it isn’t a deep market.”  Mitchell Callahan, founder at Saucal, the company behind merchant point-of-sale solution Pocket POS, for instance, expressed at least a cautious initial interest.  “An exchange going down is never good for public image … but for me it creates more opportunities,” Callahan said.  Bradley went on to suggest he saw the opening as one that would benefit major names in the international market, a development that would certainly bring yet another dramatic turn to the ecosystem.  “Coinbase is expanding worldwide. Canada seems like an obvious choice once there is regulatory clarity,” Bradley added.

42378015,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lrol,1424295353,'Super Size Me' Director Explores Life on Bitcoin in New CNN Special,"“This whole thing is so bananas.""  So says American documentary maker Morgan Spurlock in an early scene from an upcoming episode of CNN's Inside Man that focuses on bitcoin. During the show, Spurlock buys bitcoin at the New York City Bitcoin Center, helps set up new machines at a bitcoin mine and visits now-defunct Silk Road 2.0 black marketplace to purchase a fake Rolex.  The episode debuts on 19th February at 21:00 ET/PT, and like his controversial, Oscar-nominated 2004 documentary Super Size Me, the show centers on the concept of Spurlock surviving on one particular thing – in this case, he lives on bitcoin instead of the dollar.  Over the course of the episode, Spurlock helps mine bitcoin with New York-based CoinMiner, earning a day's wage by assembling new ASIC racks. During a search for coffee shops that accept bitcoin, Spurlock convinces one store to download a wallet and accept bitcoin.  The episode features a number of animated segments detailing how bitcoin mining works, including the distributed ecosystem of miners' role in verifying transactions. Other notable segments include a visit to a coffee shop that charges a minimum of $25 for orders paid with bitcoin. When asked why the charge minimum was put in place, the barista pointed to the volatility in the price of bitcoin.  ""It's so volatile that we could end up kind of getting hurt in the end, so we like to keep a good-sized transaction,"" the barista told Spurlock.  Spurlock conducts several interviews during the episode, including sit-downs with security researcher Dan Kaminsky, former FBI special agent Christopher Tarbell, West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin and author and bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos.  He ultimately points to bitcoin's open transaction ledger as a potential game-changer for how political and financial systems operate, concluding:  ""Even if the bitcoin currency bubble bursts, the technology could go down in history as one of the most important inventions of this century. It might even change the world.""

42378011,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lrjj,1424281543,"US Marshals to Auction 50,000 Bitcoins in March","The US Marshals Service has announced it will auction off 50,000 BTC, worth $11.85m at press time, to the public on 5th March.  The auction will take place from 8:00 EST to 14:00 EST, with bids being accepted only by pre-registered participants.

He continued:      “In a way we see this as the bitcoin market maturing. If thieves start pointing their crowbars at the bitcoin ATMs, we know bitcoin has gone mainstream.""

It went missing at around 07:00 on 26th January, according to Wismeijer's data      The exact amount of stolen funds is unknown. Wismeijer said that “it is hard enough to trade in bitcoin for a profit,” so “a loss like this is not easy to overcome for an independent trader”.      Although his machine was worth €2,300 ($2,600), Wismeijer says that the loss of a location and trader was ""worth far more"".      The other machine, a two-way BitAccess ATM operated by EasyBit, is thought to be worth about €8,800 ($10,000).

42378002,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpQJ,1424261064,Parkt Opens Its Parking Rewards System to Bitcoin Users,"Parking rewards startup Parkt is integrating bitcoin into its system, allowing users to withdraw earned reward points directly to a bitcoin wallet.  ""What really annoys people about parking is paying for it,"" said Parkt CEO Tim Karunaratne, noting that the average American spends about $1,300 a year doing just that. ""The system is pay-to-spend,"" he added.  Parkt  works with mobile apps on devices used by both customers and businesses. Customers first use it to scan a QR code when they check their car into a parking garage, and the app then displays a list of businesses in the local area that participate in the scheme.  When spending money at a participating business, the customer scans another QR code which adds dollar-value reward points to their account. Businesses set their own spending thresholds for rewards – for example, $3 for $50 spent.  Customers can accrue rewards from multiple businesses. They then redeem those points to gain a discount on their parking fees, or can withdraw them immediately in bitcoin.  Parkt does not feature built-in bitcoin storage, so users will still need to choose their own third-party wallet and enter its address into the Parkt app.  In order to pay out rewards to users, Parkt will need to collect fees from businesses who hope to earn extra revenue from the increased customer traffic their participation brings.  The startup acquires bitcoins on the market in accordance with customer demand. When a customer cashes out in bitcoin, the value is paid at that day's spot rate.  Encouraging local commerce  Existing parking rewards systems are usually tied to one garage and/or one company, often requiring specialist hardware for validation, which limits their scope.  Parkt, though, connects its users to a local area, allowing customers and businesses to participate in the program to join in with minimal setup.  The system is immediately scalable too, as QR codes can be printed on the ticket a customer collects at a parking garage, or even placed on a wall sign. Merchants can make special offers to parkers at multiple garages, drawing business from wider areas.  Further bitcoin integration  Parkt CTO Alex Wilhelm has been involved in bitcoin for years, even mining it in a small hydro-electric power plant operated by his father in Austria.  ""Bitcoin lends itself to micropayments ... but it needs everyday applications,"" he said.  Wilhelm said the company is working on the next stage of bitcoin integration, which would allow users to actually pay in digital currency as well.  Parkt is launching initially at 20 parking garages around its home city of Seattle, and is negotiating with almost 50 others. The firm already has a partnership with the City of Seattle, and has held discussions with the local chamber of commerce in Singapore about the feasibility of operating its system outside the US.  The company plans to move its headquarters to one of the world's greatest automotive centers, Los Angeles, where it recently won a startup award from the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce.  Parkt will be demonstrating its system today, at the Seattle Bitcoin Meetup at the University of Washington's Startup Hall at 17:30 local time.

Called the '1% Initiative', the US-only scheme launched yesterday with the aim of showcasing the benefits of bitcoin both for the consumer and the greater good, while also increasing Purse’s customer base.  Purse  is a platform through which customers can buy products on Amazon using bitcoin. Notably, shoppers receive discounts made possible by other users who pay a premium to buy bitcoin using the P2P marketplace. Last week, Purse opened its first bricks-and-mortar location in San Francisco.  Now, Purse is available for the Amazon Smile platform, the arm of the online retail giant that donates 0.5% of customers’ total order prices to a charity of their choosing.  Customers can access the Smile platform through Purse and have the same 0.5% donated to charity, while still receiving their discount for paying in bitcoin.  For the initial three months, Chain, who provides the technical back-end for Purse, will match each donation to bitcoin charity the BitGive Foundation.  BitGive executive director Connie Gallippi said:  “This new partnership is an innovative and exemplary advancement that will propel the social impact of the bitcoin community forward. We are very excited to have a way for customers to give back to charity through this new platform.”  As the functionality is built out, additional options will become available for charitable donations, Purse said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/18/purse-launches-charitable-giving-via-amazon-smile,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
