28182755,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609018,1716246044,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar To Highest Level In Months As BTC Price Surges Past $68,000","After enduring a significant 20% price correction earlier this month that saw Bitcoin fall below $56,400 and increased outflows from the Bitcoin ETF market, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has managed to stage a strong comeback. It has broken above the key $66,000 resistance level and turned it into a new support zone. BTC Bounces Back As Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar The resurgence in Bitcoin’s price has been closely tied to a rekindling of inflows into the US spot Bitcoin ETF market. Data from Farside shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their best inflow week in two months, with the US fund category collectively notching $948 million in positive net flows from May 13 to May 17. Interestingly, the majority of these inflows, approximately 89%, occurred in the last three trading days of the week, which industry analysts and researchers such as James Butterfill of CoinShares attribute to a shift in investor sentiment following the release of a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Wednesday. Butterfill stated: The inflows were an immediate response to the lower-than-expected CPI report, highlighting our view that Bitcoin prices have recoupled to interest rate expectations. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Predicts Crypto As Election Game-Changer: Impact On Price Regionally, in terms of the overall Bitcoin market, the US-dominated inflows with $1,002 million, while Switzerland and Germany also saw small inflows of $27 million and $4.2 million, respectively. Notably, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has seen outflows of $16.6 billion since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in January, saw small inflows totaling $18 million. Beyond just spot Bitcoin ETFs, the digital asset investment product space experienced inflows for the second consecutive week, totaling $932 million, according to CoinShares. However, trading volumes remained relatively low at $10.5 billion, compared to the $40 billion seen in March. Bitcoin Poised For Further Gains? The renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs and the broader digital asset space has coincided with a strong price recovery for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s ability to firmly hold the $66,250 support level, with over 530,000 BTC traded at this price, has given analysts confidence in the asset’s potential for further gains. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, if the $66,000 support holds, Bitcoin could see strong potential for further gains in the coming days, demonstrating the bullish sentiment surrounding the largest cryptocurrency on the market. However, while Bitcoin has managed to bounce back above the crucial $66,000 level after the recent pullback, the leading cryptocurrency still faces a critical test as it attempts to break out of its established trading range. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Warning Alarm For Potential 50-60% Crash In Chainlink Price, Here’s Why Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has pointed out that despite Bitcoin recording a bull flag breakout confirmation, the asset still needs to secure a daily close above $67,000 to continue its trend of higher highs and confirm the potential for further upside. The analyst further explains that Bitcoin has been oscillating between its low and high range between $60,000 and $70,000 for over two months, a natural consolidation process. As part of this, Rekt Capital believes that Bitcoin should be able to revisit the range high of $71,500 over time. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $68,130, up a substantial 9% in the last week alone and over 8% in the last fourteen days.

Prominent crypto analyst Jelle recently pointed out that Ethereum is nearing the end of a falling wedge pattern, a situation often interpreted as a bullish signal in technical analysis. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Set For A Major Rally? Options Traders Bet Big On $3,600+ Targets For June Technical Indicators And Market Sentiment Jelle observed a falling wedge pattern on Ethereum’s chart, which emerges as ETH recently reclaimed its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a development that further bolsters the bullish case. According to Jelle, if Ethereum can sustain this momentum and push past the upper boundary of the wedge, it might set its sights on the $4,000 level, a significant “psychological and technical” threshold. $ETH is close to breaking out from this falling wedge! After reclaiming the 100-day EMA, all it needs is a little push to break out from the multi-month continuation pattern. Target: >$4000. 👀📈 pic.twitter.com/IW5eIQWXzG — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) May 20, 2024 The anticipation of this breakout is heightened by the current market dynamics, where Ethereum is trading just above $3,000, specifically trading at price of $3,088, at the time of writing. The asset has experienced a modest increase of 0.2% in the last 24 hours and a total of 4.1% over the past week. However, looking at the price chart, Ethereum appears to have been consolidating just above the $3,000 level, suggesting a building base for future significant movement. This consolidation period, often called accumulation, may be largely due to market participants awaiting the upcoming decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the approval of the much-anticipated spot Ethereum ETF. With this critical announcement expected later in the week, buyers and sellers appear to be in a holding pattern, cautiously awaiting the news that will likely determine their next strategic moves. Ethereum Regulatory Decisions And Market Speculation So far, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, has expressed a cautious stance concerning the spot Ethereum ETF estimating only a 25% chance that the spot ETF will receive approval. On the other hand, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, has revealed that the process for ETF approval involves several critical steps, including the acceptance of both 19b-4 filings (Exchange Rule Changes) and S-1 registration statements (initial registration forms for new securities). Related Reading: Expert Sets Timeline For When Ethereum Price Will Begin Rally To $10,000 While there is optimism that the 19b-4 filings might be approved, there is less certainty about the S-1s.

Prosecutors say Rui-Siang Lin, 23, operated Incognito Market under the pseudonym “Pharoah” and oversaw all of its operations, including employees, vendors and customers, and had “ultimate decision-making authority over every aspect of the multimillion-dollar operation” from its formation in October 2020 to its shutdown in March this year.  “The dedicated prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and our law enforcement partners will pursue criminal actors regardless of whether they operate on street corners or in the dark corners of the internet,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a Monday statement. “The so-called ‘dark web’ is not a safe haven for those who seek to break the law.”  Lin was arrested at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday and will be presented in front of a Southern District of New York (SDNY) magistrate judge today. He faces one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of narcotics conspiracy, one count of money laundering, and one count of conspiracy to sell adulterated and misbranded medication.  The first charge – sometimes called the “kingpin statute” – carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison. Ross Ulbricht, the creator and operator of the now-shuttered Silk Road darknet drug marketplace, was found guilty of the same crime and sentenced to life in prison. The narcotics conspiracy charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum potential sentence of life in prison. The other two charges carry a combined maximum of 25 years in prison.  Lin allegedly made millions from operating Incognito Market, which took a 5% cut of every sale. The darknet market had its own “bank,” prosecutors said, which gave users an additional layer of anonymity by allowing them to deposit cryptocurrency into their own accounts, which the site then automatically transferred from buyers to sellers, minus the fee.  According to the complaint, Lin created and operated Incognito Market while an undergraduate student at the prestigious National Taiwan University.  In March, Incognito Market shut down after reportedly pulling an exit scam that left users unable to withdraw their funds. Administrators of the site then reportedly began extorting vendors, ordering them to pay a fee ranging from $100 to $20,000, depending on their size, or else risk having their customers’ data leaked.

The analyst hinted that the flagship crypto was currently mirroring its price action in 2017 and could soon make a parabolic rise like it did back then. History Could Repeat Itself TechDev shared a chart on his X (formerly Twitter) platform with the caption, “The more things change, the more they stay the same.” The chart showed that Bitcoin’s current price action was mirroring that of the 2017 bull run when it recorded a price gain of 1,200% on its way to a previous high of $20,000. Related Reading: This Crypto Trader Just Sold All His Bitcoin For Altcoins Like Cardano And XRP, Here’s Why Interestingly, just like in 2017, when Bitcoin’s price bottomed following the Bitfinex crash, the crypto token also looked to have bottomed in this market cycle when FTX, another crypto exchange, collapsed. Back then, Bitcoin consolidated for some time before enjoying a parabolic rally, which made it reach $20,000 in 2018. As TechDev suggested, history could repeat itself with Bitcoin consolidating ahead of a move that could send it to as high as $100,000. From the chart the crypto analyst shared, one could see that Bitcoin has consolidated longer in this market cycle than it did in 2017. However, crypto analyst Rekt Capital hinted that this longer period of consolidation was necessary. He mentioned that Bitcoin was accelerating by almost 200 days in this market cycle and added that consolidating for longer will help it resynchronize with previous bull cycles. This strategic consolidation is a reassuring sign of Bitcoin’s stability and potential for growth. Meanwhile, in a recent X post, he revealed that Bitcoin was already attempting to perform the “post Bull Flag breakout retest,” which could secure a trend continuation to the upside. In a subsequent X post, Rekt Capital shared a chart showing that a breakout from the $66,000 range could kickstart the continuation of Bitcoin’s bull run, which could well send its price above $100,000. “Optimal Targets” For Bitcoin In This Market Cycle Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto mentioned in an X post that the optimal targets for Bitcoin in this bull run should be between $138,000 and $150,000. Interestingly, he made this statement while revealing that the crypto’s current price action is mirroring that of 2017. The crypto analyst’s prediction suggests that Bitcoin enjoying a 1,200% price gain (like in 2017) is unlikely. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Return To The Table, Increase Massive Holdings By 10% However, it is worth noting that other crypto analysts like PlanB have offered more bullish predictions for Bitcoin, which indicates that the flagship crypto could still see a 10x increase from its current price level. Specifically, PlanB predicted that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $1 million in 2025, which would be the market top for the crypto token.

42390819,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMwph,1716237208,"Ether ETFs Filing Process Sees Abrupt Progress, Though Approval Not Guaranteed: Sources","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked aspiring ether exchange-traded fund exchanges to update 19b-4 filings ahead of a key deadline this week.  The SEC had previously been expected to reject the ether ETF filings, and while there's no guarantee of approval, the move suggests progress is being made.  The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products.  Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday.  That doesn't mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn't tied to a deadline.  One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications.  They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd.  The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism.  If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications.  One test of the agency's view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

Fueled by Roaring Kitty’s return, part of the memecoin sector registered remarkable gains over the past week, with Tokens like Pepe (PEPE), Popcat (POPCAT), and Dogwifhat (WIF) leading the way. Related Reading: Floki Inu Frenzy: Memecoin Eyes New Highs As Open Interest Soars Due to its recent performance, some analysts forecast a new boost for WIF soon, while some whales load their bags with the dog-themed token. Whales Put Their Hats On Dogwifhat’s price soared after Roaring Kitty’s comeback, surging to $3.25 and prompting whales to fill their bags. However, the price fluctuations over the past week have made some large investors sell the dog-themed memecoin at a loss. After WIF’s price dropped over the weekend, a whale sold 1.7 million tokens at a loss to buy BONK and the Donald Trump-inspired memecoin TREMP, the address initially bought WIF at $2.94 in March and sold it on Sunday at an average of $2.57. Nonetheless, the price drop was seen as an opportunity for other large-scale investors. According to Lookonchain, a whale created a new wallet to buy Dogfight. On Monday, the wallet withdrew 1.83 million USDC from Coinbase to buy the dog-themed token. At the time of the report, the investor had spent 606,000 USDC to buy 227,896 WIF at $2.66. The wallet had 1.22 million USDC left to continue the buying spree. A few hours later, the whale had spent another 400,000 USDC to buy 145,000 more tokens. As of this writing, the address displays a total WIF balance of 472,614, worth around $1.28 million. Similarly, another whale created a new wallet to buy dogwifhat. Per the reports, this whale used SOL to scoop 1 million WIF, worth around $2.53 million, on Sunday. Since then, the address has added more tokens to his bag, currently holding 1.39 million WIF, worth $3.8 million. WIF Ready For A New ATH This Month? The recent whale activity seemingly fueled the token’s price to soar above $2.7, hovering between $2.7 and $2.73 in the following hours. The surge represents a 10.4% increase in the past 24 hours. Despite the recent performance, the token still registers red numbers in longer timeframes. WIF’s price has decreased by 8.3% and 14.8% in the weekly and bi-weekly timeframes. Moreover, its daily trading volume has seen a significant 21.6% decrease in the past 24 hours. Nonetheless, market watchers consider that this cycle’s dog-themed sensation still has its hat on. Crypto trader Scient identified a bull pennant pattern on WIF’s chart. Per the trader, the token is still consolidating inside the pattern. The token’s performance displayed “another bullish sign indicating that this consolidation is ending soon” after having a higher high followed by a lower high. Similarly, Ansem, a popular trader and figure in the crypto world, suggested that WIF could be preparing for new highs.

42390816,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMwVB,1716233884,What to Expect at Consensus 2024: Spotlight on Blockchain Tech,"Bitcoin layer 2s. Ethereum restaking. Interoperability. AI. DePIN. Next-generation cryptography.  These are just a handful of the cutting-edge blockchain tech topics on the agenda at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 conference, which runs Wednesday, May 29, through Friday, May 31, in Austin, Texas.  For blockchain developers, it's red meat. For others, it may sound unfamiliar. For everyone, including those somewhere in between, the three days are packed with opportunities to learn about the hottest crypto tech on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and XRP Ledger – from the world's top experts.  We took a spin through the agenda to identify stages and sessions likely to interest blockchain developers and people interested in the technology.  In general there are six broad categories of relevant programming:  Panel discussions and on-stage interviews – mostly on the Mainstage, Town Square and Money Reimagined Stage.  Protocol Village: We give blockchain projects a dedicated time and venue, and they plan the content.  Workshops: What it sounds like. People who know what they're talking about try to explain important topics to smart people who show up.  AI Summit: Discussions on what blockchain can do for crypto and AI, and vice-versa.  Startup Village: Where the PitchFest takes place, along with sessions on subjects that blockchain project founders need to know.  Side Events: Some official, many unofficial.  Panel discussions  The overall Consensus agenda is pretty sprawling. In terms of the blockchain tech highlights, the following would represent our picks.  Wednesday:  1:45 p.m. (Mainstage): Joe Lubin of Consensys discusses Ethereum with Consensus Chair Michael Casey.  2:45 p.m. (Mainstage): Emin Gün Sirer, CEO, Ava Labs, the primary developer of Avalanche, joins a panel on what blockchain can do for AI, and what AI can do for crypto.  3 p.m. (Town Square): Bryan Bishop, early Bitcoin coder (and now a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal editor), discusses the early days on a panel with other crypto OGs.  Thursday:  12:45 p.m. (Mainstage): David Marcus, former head of the Facebook/Meta Diem/Libra, talks about Lightspark, his digital-payments startup based on Bitcoin's Lightning Network.  1:15 p.m. (Mainstage): Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, talks about his project's work with the global banking-payments network Swift, in a panel moderated by CoinDesk's Sam Kessler.  4:15 p.m. (Town Square): John Adler, co-founder and chief research officer of Celestia Labs, and Austin Federa, head of strategy for Solana Foundation, discuss whether modular or monolithic blockchains are the better way to scale.  Friday:  10 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen discusses where DeFi is headed.  10:40 a.m. (Mainstage): Raj Gokal, co-founder and president of Solana Labs, discusses the network's future and the upcoming release of the Firedancer software designed to improve performance.  11 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): Helium CEO Abhay Kumar speaks on a panel about the future of ""decentralized physical infrastructure networks,"" or DePIN (formerly referred to as Internet of Things, or IoT).  11:30 a.m. (Mainstage): Casey Rodarmor, the developer who almost single-handedly created the two most impactful protocols launched atop Bitcoin in the past two years – Ordinals and Runes – talks about what comes next and his vision for the oldest and largest blockchain.  11:45 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk leads a discussion on liquid staking and restaking.  12 p.m. (Town Square): AMA with Casey Rodarmor  12:15 p.m. (Startup Village): Injective co-founder Eric Chen discusses his vision for the future of finance.  3 p.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): Gauntlet co-founder Tarun Chitra speaks on a panel about ""de-risking DeFi,"" from preventing smart-contract bugs and rug pulls to dealing with treasury management strategies and audits.

42390815,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMwQ3,1716233727,This Is (Hopefully) the Last CoinDesk Article to Mention Craig Wright,"Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto and not the author of the Bitcoin white paper, as was determined by Justice James Mellor, who handed down that judgment after the COPA v Wright trial wrapped up.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But not only is Craig Wright not Satoshi Nakamoto and not the author of the Bitcoin white paper, he also wasted the court’s time, according to Mellor’s much-anticipated, 231-page written assessment of the trial.  As CoinDesk’s Camomile Shumba summarized:  “Craig Wright lied ‘extensively and repeatedly’ in both his written and oral evidence in the Crypto Open Patent Alliance case regarding his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, Judge James Mellor said in his written judgment on Monday.  Wright is apparently looking to appeal the decision – a bad sign for anyone who wished that COPA’s brave attempt to actually litigate and settle the matter of whether CSW was stealing Satoshi’s valor (by stealing his identity) once and for all.  Ever since he arrived on the scene in December 2015, Wright has been causing chaos for the crypto industry – including suing Bitcoin Core developers, public figures and a feline astronaut called Hodlonaut, who was an affirmed private citizen before his CSW imbroglio.  And that was essentially the motivation behind COPA’s suit. Although all of CSW’s legal claims essentially centered around the claim that he invented Bitcoin (he was able to copyright the white paper), in all of his libel and infringement lawsuits over the years that was always an incidental issue.  Read more: Craig Wright Assets Frozen by UK Judge to Prevent Him Evading Court Costs  COPA, which is backed by Jack Dorsey and Coinbase, among others, put the question directly when it filed suit in 2021. Then, over several weeks in a U.K. court, the group was able to systematically prove to the court that Wright had been forging documents, spewing lies and filing costly and wasteful lawsuits for years.  “This decision is a watershed moment for the open-source community and even more importantly, a definitive win for the truth. Developers can now continue their important work maintaining, iterating on, and improving the Bitcoin network without risking their personal livelihoods or fearing costly and time-consuming litigation from Craig Wright,” a COPA spokesperson said.  In the judgment, which, really, goes above-and-beyond the call of duty to excoriate the Australian computer scientist, Justice Mellor said Wright ""lied to the court repeatedly,"" committed forgery ""on a grand scale"" and “is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is.” (The FT’s Alphaville has a nice rundown of the juiciest morsels from the document.)  It’s not just that the judge appears to understand the extent of CSW’s grift, but also Bitcoin itself, arguing that seeking to control Bitcoin through the courts is something Satoshi would never dream of doing.  So, with this, I think we may finally be able to bid Wright adieu. He has dropped his five-year legal actions against Holdonaut and podcaster Peter McCormack, and will no longer be able to pursue cases in the U.K., Wright’s chosen venue for the majority of his legal actions due to the nation’s extremely lax libel laws.

Bitcoin SOPR Suggests Profit-Taking From Investors Has Cooled Off In a new post on X, analyst Willy Woo has discussed about the latest trend occurring in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). The SOPR is an on-chain indicator that basically tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling their coins at a profit or loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector could be assumed to be moving coins at some net profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies loss realization is the dominant mode of selling in the market. Related Reading: Chainlink Becomes Crypto Winner With 21% Rally: What’s Driving This? Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests the total profits being realized are exactly equal to the losses at the moment and thus, the investors are just breaking-even on their selling. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been neutral in recent days | Source: @woonomic on X As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR had spiked to highly positive levels earlier when the cryptocurrency’s price had observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH). This would suggest that the investors had been participating in some aggressive profit-taking during this run. From the chart, it’s visible that such a trend was also observed around the start of the 2021 bull run. With the consolidation, the asset has gone through since the ATH, the indicator’s value has also seen a cooldown. As Woo has highlighted in the chart, the metric has now approached the neutral mark. It would appear that two months after the profit-taking peaked, the appetite for harvesting gains has potentially finally disappeared among the investors. The analyst says this is a very healthy reset for the cryptocurrency, especially as the capital inflows have once again been picking up for the coin. Looks like the indicator has gone through a turnaround recently | Source: @woonomic From the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin network flows had been following an overall downward trajectory earlier when the consolidation was taking place, but recently, capital injections into the coin have once again been on the rise. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Has “A Lot Of Room To Run Before Reversal,” Says Top Analyst This is a similar trend to what was observed earlier in the year during the crash following the approval of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The turnabout in capital inflows back then was what led into the rally that took the cryptocurrency to the current ATH. BTC Price Bitcoin had seen a pullback under $66,000 yesterday, raising worries that the recovery surge had already fizzled out. This drop only lasted briefly, though, as the coin has returned above $67,000 today.

However, based on his explanation, LINK holders may not have cause to worry as such a price drop is part of the crypto token’s growth. Why Chainlink Will Experience A Price Drop CrediBULL Crypto explained in an X (formerly Twitter) post that a “50-60% drawdown is normal, natural, and healthy” given that Chainlink has experienced ten months of up only and a 4x rally.” The analyst expects this price drawdown to last about two to three months and suggested that Chainlink could see brief price surges, but that doesn’t invalidate the current bearish trend. Related Reading: Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run In a video posted on his YouTube channel, CrediBULL Crypto further explained why he is so confident in shorting Chainlink. He alluded to the rise in the crypto token’s open interest and claimed that many levered players entered Chainlink on the pump to a major resistance level. He expects that those investors who opened longs will likely begin to close their positions as soon as Bitcoin experiences a pullback and the crypto market starts bleeding again. The crypto analyst added that these investors will capitulate at the lows, which will bring Chainlink’s price to the range lows. CrediBULL Crypto claimed that this move will bring LINK back down to $11.96, about a 30% drop from its current price levels. Based on this, he revealed that he will be looking to short Chainlink around $16, which is the likely level for rejection. Same Expectations For Meme Coins CrediBULL Crypto also expects meme coins to experience a significant price drawdown, given the parabolic rally they have enjoyed since the beginning of the year. Meme coins Dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepe (PEPE) have been the most significant year-to-date (YTD) gainers among the top 50 crypto tokens, with price gains of over 1,400% and 500%, respectively. The crypto analyst warned that some major meme coins have already seen their tops and will likely experience significant declines. In the YouTube video he posted, he also gave insights into how low Dogecoin, WIF, and Pepe could drop. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Willy Woo Predicts Bitcoin Has Room To Run – Here Are The Drivers For Dogecoin, he predicts that the foremost meme coin could drop to as low as $0.10. However, CrediBULL Crypto noted that he can’t short Dogecoin yet because he expects a relief pump to $0.18, the range he is looking to open a short position. Meanwhile, he predicts that WIF could drop to as low as $1.6, revealing that he will be looking to short it at $3.90 because he expects the meme coin to enjoy one last push to the upside before dropping to the downside. CrediBULL also predicts a significant price decline for PEPE. He claims the meme coin could experience a drawdown of as much as 60% since it recently hit a new all-time high (ATH).

28168694,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608968,1716224445,"Bitcoin Whales Are Not Selling, BTC Has Strong Support Above $60,000","Bitcoin is rising, recently breaking above $67,000, and heading towards the all-important $70,000, a psychological round number. One analyst took to X amid this uptick, noting that whales holding over 1,000 BTC are not moving their coins to exchanges. Instead, they likely expect prices to spike higher in the coming days and weeks. Though movements over the weekend were muted, the extension earlier today is overly bullish for optimistic traders. As BTC prices edge, coin holders (and sometimes whales) usually take profits, especially if gains are shaky and not as strong. Whales Are Not Selling, More Gains Expected? However, the current cycle looks like whales are holding on, expecting prices to recover strongly. The analyst notes that the 30-day average is 641 BTC, with the reading decreasing sharply from mid-2023. This means that whales are bullish and unmoved by short-term price movements. Though this observation doesn’t necessarily mean bulls expect a moonshot, they are holding cement the outlook that prices might move higher in the coming sessions. Related Reading: XRP Holders In Panic Selling Frenzy? Sub-$0.50 Looms Accompanying the breakout above $66,0000, on-chain data shows that the Market Value to Realize Value (MVRV) ratio is also rising. According to the analyst, the MVRV ratio for those who have held BTC for between 1 and 3 months has climbed above 66,500. This expansion means they have exited the “unrealized loss” zone, signaling a shift in sentiment among short-term holders. At spot rates and prices trading above $66,700, above the $66,500 level, HODLers are in the green and can exit for a profit or HODL. Bitcoin Finds Strong Support Above $60,000 It remains to be seen how prices will react in the short to medium term. However, another analyst notes that over 530,000 BTC was traded at $66,250. Accordingly, this line is turning out to be a strong, reliable support. If bulls soak in the selling pressure, the line at $66,250 can act as a reliable anchor for the next leg up toward an all-time high. Analysts agree that the zone above $60,000 is a reliable support level. Taking to X, another analyst said that the Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Cost Basis (STHCB) is rising and stands at $60,700. Historically, the STHCB has acted as a dynamic support during bull runs and resistance in bear markets. In on-chain analysis, the STHCB is a metric that tracks the average price at which short-term holders (those holding BTC for less than 180 days, bought their coins.

28166269,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608952,1716220822,"Dogecoin Forms Symmetrical Triangle, Rally On The Horizon?","Amidst a significant surge displayed by Dogecoin (DOGE) recently, popular crypto analyst Crypto Daily Trade Signals has identified a symmetrical triangle pattern in the price movements of the crypto asset, indicating a possible continuation of the present rising trend. Based on the expert analysis, Dogecoin, which has attracted a lot of attention and interest from investors lately, may be preparing to build on its current momentum and make more gains. Significance Of Dogecoin Symmetrical Triangle Pattern A symmetrical triangle chart pattern is a consolidation phase that precedes a forced breakout or decline in price. A new bearish trend begins with a breakdown from the lower trend line, while a new bullish trend begins with a breakout from the upper trend line. Related Reading: Dogecoin Successfully Breaks Out Above $0.153, What Next? According to the analyst, the symmetrical triangle pattern presents a major obstacle for DOGE at the $0.1545 price level. At the same time, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) continues to provide support at the $0.1513 level. Even though the current market price is above the 50 EMA and suggests a bullish bias, Crypto Daily Trade Signals noted that Dogecoin has to surpass the resistance level of $0.1595 in order to confirm that the upward trend is continuing. This perspective is further strengthened by the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is currently above the 50 EMA and supports a purchasing trend. The post read: Dogecoin has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, presenting a significant hurdle around the $0.1545 mark. Simultaneously, support persists around the $0.1513 level, reinforced by the 50-day EMA. The expert highlighted that DOGE is at a pivotal point around $0.15100 on the 4-hour chart, indicating a bullish momentum, and an immediate resistance at the $0.15950 mark. The first obstacle to be cleared is the immediate resistance at $0.15950, which is followed by the $0.16980 and $0.18440 levels. Although caution is advised if DOGE drops below the pivot point, the RSI’s current position indicates an opportunity for more profits. Thus far, the upward trend is supported by a firm base provided by the 50-day EMA around $0.15130. Meanwhile, on the negative side, $0.14270 provides immediate support, while $0.13240 and $0.12030 provide additional levels of support, with the RSI at 53, which denotes neutral conditions. Is $12 DOGE Possible? Crypto analyst Javin Marks has also shared insights on Dogecoin’s recent price action, predicting a potential massive rally to $12. According to the expert, based on previous breakouts and runs, DOGE has maintained its broken status once more. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About to Take Off? Indicators Suggest Upward Momentum Ahead These runs have become bigger one after the other, and the last run recorded over 20,000% upsurge. Given the nature of the runs, Javon Marks anticipates the recent run, which might be in its early stage now, to be bigger than the last one. As a result, the expert experts DOGE to reach $12 or even higher following the run. Also, Marks noted that after the run has concluded, DOGE could see another massive rise of over 7,500%.

28163901,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608907,1716217211,"Bitcoin Retail Investors Are Dumping Amid Jump To $67,000, Why This Is Good For Price","The Bitcoin price recovery above the $67,000 level has triggered a round of selling, but it is not from the usual camp of large investors selling. This time around, it is the small-time traders who are offloading their bags and putting selling pressure on the price. However, this is not an entirely bad thing given that, historically, such selling has been bullish for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Retail Are Dumping Their Bags In a report on X (formerly Twitter), the on-chain data tracker Santiment revealed an interesting trend among small-time Bitcoin investors. As the price of Bitcoin rallied past $67,000 over the weekend, these small wallets took this as the time to sell and secure profit. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Return To The Table, Increase Massive Holdings By 10% These wallets are those holding below 0.1 BTC on their balances. This means that at the high end, these wallets are holding an average of $6,000. In the space of one week, Santiment notes that their collective holdings had dropped 0.46%. 🐟👋 #Bitcoin is dancing just above $66.1K as small traders continue to #liquidate their holdings despite the #crypto bounce over the past week. Historically, small wallets dumping their coins to larger wallets is an encouraging and #bullish sign for $BTC. https://t.co/wlz4XPhfMD pic.twitter.com/dTJAy5G6pL — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 19, 2024 Selling among smaller wallets is not new, but at this level, it could have a significant impact on the price. However, compared to when whale and sharks sell their BTC holdings, retail investors selling is usually bullish for the price. This is because as the smaller traders sell, the BTC is picked up by the larger traders, who are usually longer-term holdings. As blockchain agency Crynet explains in a response to Santiment: “While small traders divesting might seem concerning, it’s often a bullish signal. Historically, this redistribution to larger holders indicates stronger hands in the market. Let’s see how this plays out.” Bullish Sentiment Rises Among Investors The selling by small Bitcoin traders comes amid a jump in bullishness. As Santiment reported in a previous post, bullishness among Bitcoin investors has now jumped to a 4-month high. The last time that investors were this bullish was back in January 2024 when the price of BTC had jumped above $45,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run Bitcoin’s weighted sentiment is now sitting at a value of 0.99, and although this is still lower than its January high of almost 1.8, it remains one of the highest among large caps. Currently, only the Chainlink (LINK) weighted sentiment is higher after rising to a new one-year high of 1.829. 🥳 The crowd’s sentiment has shifted toward #Bitcoin after the surprise bounce above $66K Wednesday (and now above $67.2K). Additionally, #Chainlink is seeing its most #bullish sentiment in over a year. #FOMO staying low will help these rises continue. https://t.co/TcEPBdS9Oh pic.twitter.com/czvE1mOgId — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 17, 2024 The Ethereum weighted sentiment is currently sitting at a low -0.44, while XRP and Binance’s BNB are sitting at around -0.37. This suggests that bearishness continues to dominate among these assets while crypto investors look to Bitcoin to lead the market. At the time of writing, the BTC price is still trading at a high price of $66,900. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is seeing a 6.78% increase in the last week and a small decline of 0.5% in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Throughout Thursday, May 30, 40 teams will pitch to leading VCs, culminating in a grand finale on Friday, May 31, from 10:00 am to 10:30 am.  In total, there are 21 entrants in Web3 and blockchain infrastructure, four in open payment and exchange systems, three each in AI/blockchain interface and NFTs, two each in digital identity/credentials, decentralized IoT networks, and organizational governance for DAOs, and one in enterprise data solutions.  This year's contest includes entrants from around the world including India, Singapore, Nepal, Hong Kong, Argentina, and Azerbaijan.  The PitchFest winner will receive prominent exposure across CoinDesk's various media platforms and social handles, technical one-on-one sessions with Google Cloud's Web3 product leaders, and two VIP Piranha Passes for Consensus 2025, with more prizes to be announced.  The judges for Pitchfest include Meltem Demirors, Head of Strategy at CoinShares, Soona Amhaz from Volt Capital, CoinFund's David Pakman, crypto and tech investor Bill Tai, and others from Bullish Capital Management, Google Cloud, Outlier Ventures, as well as other notable VC firms.

Four startups from the 40 PitchFest finalists will join a live episode of ""Meet the Drapers"" at Consensus, pitching to Tim Draper and members of his family's office for a chance to win $50,000 and compete for a $1 million grand prize.

42390806,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMvl1,1716215016,Web3 Marketing Needs Some of Apple’s Secret Sauce,"The launch of Apple’s Vision Pro headset has been perhaps the most controversial in its recent history – certainly, the biggest pivot since the company moved into the telecommunications market with the launch of the iPhone in 2007. Presenting the innovation at the time, then-CEO Steve Jobs claimed that it would “reinvent the phone.” Boy, was he right.  Current CEO Tim Cook is betting the magic is still there with the Vision Pro – and he’s making many of the same branding and messaging plays that proved so successful for his predecessor, even while the apps, as use cases that prove the technology, are still in their earliest stages of development.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  Apple Vision Pro is a headset, but you won’t find that word on the product’s landing page. Neither does Apple doesn’t overly concern itself with terms like augmented reality, extended reality, or mixed reality, even though those technologies are the essence of what the Vision Pro does.  Instead, Apple chooses to tell you about how the Vision Pro enables you to enjoy immersive entertainment experiences from your sofa, capture and relive your precious moments as 3D photos and collaborate with remote colleagues as seamlessly as if you were in the same room.  This is Apple’s secret sauce. It doesn’t tell us why we need the technology – it shows us why we want what it can do. This simple yet impactful communication strategy was instrumental in the widespread adoption of smartphones – and it already seems to be working for the Vision Pro. The device launched to U.S. consumers in February with an initial user base of up to 200,000 based on sales. If that seems underwhelming, then game engine giant Unity announced support for VisionOS from the moment of its release and there are further plans to roll out the device to the tech-hungry Chinese market later this year.  Like spatial computing, Web3 is also an umbrella term, liberally thrown together with terms like blockchain, digital assets, DeFi and the rest of the crypto-jargon dictionary. But most people embedded in the crypto sphere have little grasp of how meaningless these words are to the lay person – and it’s not for a want of understanding their implications.  Assuredly, the techis appealing: a global survey carried out by Consensys found that 83% of respondents prioritize data privacy, 70% think they should share in the profits made from their data and 79% desire greater control over their online identities. Thus, the core values of Web3 are a vote-winner with the general public. Yet a disconnect remains: people support the ideology of Web3 without realizing what it is or how they can incorporate it into their lives.  At the moment, the industry is an echo chamber with companies preaching to the converted using an esoteric lingua franca that resonates with a small audience of switched-on, tech-savvy users and crypto-native investors. To make good on the promise of Web3, there needs to be a shift towards more accessible, relatable messaging.  To give a simple example, instead of discussing the intricacies of distributed ledger technology, the focus should be on the new use cases: what can we do now that we couldn’t do before?  For instance, how someone working overseas who wants to send money home to their beloved family can access instant, cheap and secure cross-border payments while protecting their personal data?  Or how can new login methods and a new online identity help otherwise non-tech savvy users take back control of their data, doing away with the need for complex password managers or the headache of lost credentials?  See also: Apple's 'Vision Pro' Set to Get First Crypto-Focused Metaverse App  Or, how can we empower a growing global population of digital creators to earn actual, meaningful income from their creations without ceding control of their IP or risking losing their carefully curated audiences and content?  All these and many other use cases are critical to the massive adoption of blockchain-based products. But in each case, they’re focused on a person who wants or needs what the technology can do – in a way that’s different or better than it can be done today.  Just as the internet was once a complex concept now widely understood, web3 can be explained through familiar scenarios and analogies that link it to everyday experiences. In the case of NFTs, the comparison to irreproducible digital collectibles – one-of-a-kind trading cards – is one just about everyone can comprehend.  In short, for Web3 to enter the mainstream it must adopt a comms strategy that lands with the 92% of people currently beyond its realm of influence. This can be achieved through simplified messaging, a focus on relatable benefits, and jargon-free storytelling and analogies.  By speaking the language of Web2, the blockchain world will not only be understood but also embraced as the natural evolution of the World Wide Web.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Tomer Sharoni,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/20/web3-marketing-needs-some-of-apples-secret-sauce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b055c5685053ce77258a09dd5f9648529cde1d44-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, this anti-crypto stance may very well cost US President Joe Biden another term in office. Related Reading: Solana Blasts Past Resistance: Buckle Up For $330 Breakout – Analyst In a scathing rebuke, Hoskinson accused the administration of harboring a “systematic effort to hurt the crypto industry,” citing numerous policy meetings, private dinners, and open letters where the community has tried in vain to foster understanding. Despite these attempts at engagement, he argues, regulators remain steadfast in their campaign against the sector. “53 million Americans, regardless of their politics and preferences, are being painted as soft criminals,” Hoskinson laments, warning that this hostile environment has already landed some of his industry peers, including Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao, in jail. The Elizabeth Warren Factor Hoskinson has singled out Sen. Elizabeth Warren as the driving force behind the administration’s anti-crypto agenda, going so far as to suggest a clandestine pact between her and Biden. The Cardano founder claims that Warren, known for her staunch opposition to digital assets, was able to extend her influence into the Treasury Department, handpicking like-minded individuals who share her distaste for the industry. This perceived alliance, Hoskinson argues, has resulted in an administration that is heavily tilted against crypto, effectively labeling a significant portion of the population as “criminals.” He views this as a devastating blow, not just for the industry but for the democratic process as a whole. Crypto As The ‘Kingmaker’ Amidst his frustrations, Hoskinson offers a tantalizing prediction: the crypto industry will be the “kingmaker” in future US elections. He asserts that the current administration’s anti-crypto stance is predicated on the belief that there will be no political consequences to its actions. However, Hoskinson is convinced that the voting public will prove them wrong. Hoskinson declares, underscoring the pivotal role that the crypto industry could play in shaping the political landscape: “If this President loses his job and crypto is the decider, no Democrat running in 2028 will be anti-crypto.” The Cardano founder envisions a future where the next generation of Congress members, senators, and presidents are “crypto natives,” paving the way for a more inclusive and progressive regulatory environment. He believes that the industry’s exponential growth and increasing influence will make it a force to be reckoned with in the political arena. How This Impacts The Price Of Crypto The escalating tensions between the Biden administration and the crypto industry have had a direct impact on the broader digital asset market. Investor confidence has been shaken, leading to significant volatility and price fluctuations across major cryptocurrencies. In the wake of the crackdown and the heightened political rhetoric, Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen sharp declines, with prices dropping by over 20% in the past month alone.

Industry experts warn that this turbulence may continue until a clearer path forward emerges, either through a change in political leadership or a softening of the administration’s stance on crypto.

42390810,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMw0P,1716212937,Hamster Wheel: Telegram’s Social Gaming Brings Millions to Crypto,"In past lives, I have been a city planner, a crime boss and a CEO at a thriving crypto exchange. On Telegram, that is. Why I enjoy job cosplay is a question for my therapist. But it’s fascinating how many Web3 games explore these real-life roles. And it’s great the rewards are starting to be worth more bragging rights among your friends.  I lost endless amounts of time building my Sims town in the early-2000s, where I grew a small village into a bustling metropolis on my underpowered Windows95 desktop. I had to think through power management and food supply routes and whether or not a stadium was necessary for tax revenue to support a few more parks.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  Fast-forward to 2009 and I am living my best Tony Soprano life with two baseball bats, a Tommy Gun, and enough property to make me one hundred and seven thousand dollars every 54 minutes in virtual currency. What “Mob Wars” had that The Sims didn’t was the network-effect power of the Facebook recommendation feed. That you could see the moves that your friends were making made you want to join into the game, and the exponential effect kept rolling and rolling.  Until Facebook put a squash on the category, as it clamped down on external notifications, taxation of virtual items, and prioritized its own features over third-party ones.  Telegram has learned some lessons from the original social media platforms, and added new modes of gamification appealing to the insatiable gambler mindset of the crypto crowd. Telegram, which has 900 million monthly users, is proving that gaming could be to be the next big player/customer acquisition platform to help grow a blockchain-forward business.  Telegram Messenger has been around for over ten years. Brothers Nikolai and Pavel Durov created the encrypted messaging platform in 2013 and soon after counted one hundred thousand users on the nascent platform.  Today, that number is approaching one billion and while not fully decentralized, its mix of strong encryption and distributed storage security make it a favorite among the crypto community. And that is before Hamster Kombat came to the platform.  Anyone in crypto looking to build an audience should be paying attention to Telegram  There have been numerous telegram crypto bots to date: services like Meme and Gif makers to GitHub notification bots, to Gmail and Spotify integrations. One application type that the crypto audience has particularly taken to is gamification. From BonkBot, which allowed simple, hyper-fast crypto flipping during the recent Solana memecoin season to Notcoin, which racked up a $1 billion in FDV after 35 million players grinded on the Telegram-based game from January to April. Clear lesson:utility plus fun, plus crypto, works well on the messaging app. A Hamster Comes Calling  The most recent entrant to catch fire in this schema is Hamster Kombat. In just over four weeks, the app has grown to over 8 million players, with more than 3 million playing daily.  The premise of Hamster Kombat is pretty straightforward. You are the CEO of a crypto exchange of your choice (Binance, OKX, MEXC and others). At first, all you do is tap the hamster on the screen to start earning some points. As soon as the available points get depleted, they start to count back up again, encouraging you to return and tap for more.  Once you have accrued enough, you, as CEO, can start to put your currency to work. You can put your points into BTC and ETH pairs yielding you hourly returns. You can spend on CoinTelegraph (or CoinDesk, if you get to level 10), or on enhancing your KYC or AML security. Each choice brings you more hourly profits back in so you can now passively earn and put more currency to work to grow your fictional exchange.  From a marketing perspective, the more you share with friends, the more you join connected channels, the more you earn to grow your business, the better. Hence the SocialFi overlay that makes the game so viral. I have seven friends, all playing through links I shared with them, which then makes me more currency to deploy to grow my empire.  Hamster Kombat allows partners to buy “cards” and for players to take actions and earn more currency per hour. Joining a partner Telegram channel may cost 15,000 points. But it pays back 3000 points per hour, making it something that has “paid” for itself in 5 hours of actively engaging with the game. This partner, a new gaming blockchain, saw their telegram subscribers swell to over 1.2 million people in just a few days after launching with Hamster Kombat, a staggeringly quick onboarding of new users in an ecosystem where attention and users are highly in demand. It was then that I felt the need to reach out and investigate what their special sauce is.  I contacted Nikita Anufriev, a marketing advisor to Hamster Kombat and host of a popular crypto channel on YouTube. Anufriev confirmed that the project was launched on March 25 of this year and it took just 11 days to reach 1 million players. Since then, it has topped 8 million players, and he stated that 2.8 million users play daily with an average use time of 52 minutes per day. Pretty staggering for a new game tied directly to a social media platform.  When asked about the genesis of the game, Anufriev gave credit to a ten year old game called USA Simulator, a mid-2010s iOS/Android game where you play as a politician with a stated goal to “Develop your country, extend the sphere of influence and lead the country to the world domination!.” He said the founders were inspired by the game and reframed it to be specifically about the crypto industry and let the users stand in the shoes of CZ (Binance) or Brian Armstrong (Coinbase).  “The viral effect started from 3 [shares per player] and now it’s closer to 15,” Anufriev said. “The in-game mechanics, like a new card, pushes you to invite friends and we saw this problem in certain regions where too many influencers started to promote it and regular people don’t have enough people to invite.” Anufriev’s team targeted an influencer audience for the first few hundred thousand users, but then the network effect took over. ”Telegram is widely popular among crypto users and is the number one messenger app for that audience,” he notes.  TON (The Open Network), the Layer-1 blockchain that was created by Telegram but now operates independently of the social platform, has been seeing serious adoption recently, and the TON token has been rising with it. But Anufriev said the project will issue its token on the Binance Smart Chain, with the end of May the target release date.  Nikita Anufriev, and many other Hamster players, will be coming to Consensus 2024 and we will see if this reward seeking community will also join together in real life or if they prefer being an anonymous player from behind a screen. For now, Telegram seems to be one place that anyone in crypto looking to build an audience should be paying attention to.  UPDATE (5/21/24; 15:55 UTC): Telegram is not responsible for creating games on its platform and does not manage or coordinate the The Open Network (TON).",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Sam Ewen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/20/hamster-wheel-telegrams-social-gaming-brings-millions-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c0a076754874c5e3b1c1407f2e1f2c8749575ae-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390822,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMx55,1716212236,How Web3 Marketing Changes the Game,"The one thing – perhaps the only thing – that people on the internet can agree upon is that the internet is broken. We’re served up ads that are annoying. We’re always accepting cookies. We’re being tracked. We’re leaking data. And we can’t escape the tractor beam of the Googles and Facebooks of the world.  What if there’s a better way?  The promise of “Web3 marketing” is more than just a niche interest for ad execs. It could transform how all of us use the internet, how we consume media, and how we interact with our favorite movies and NBA players and coffee shops and whiskey labels.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week.  Just as bitcoin removed the middleman of banks to offer peer-to-peer transactions, Web3 marketing could bypass Google and Facebook to let brands build relationships directly with consumers. A Web3 marketing framework, in theory, could preserve privacy, allow for better targeting, and even share revenue back to the users. “Google and Facebook don’t want to do this. They don’t have to,” says Dan Novaes, the Founder and CEO of Mode Mobile. “They’re giants. They’re behemoths. The issue with Web2 marketing is that you’re SOL if you don’t play nice with those products.”  Novaes has been studying the alignment of customers and brands for years--ever since high school, when he launched an e-commerce company that swelled to $2 million, in part by scooping up wholesale electronics in the U.S. and then flipping them overseas for higher prices. (This was a simpler time.)  Years before anyone used the term “Web3,” Novaes hatched a project that rewarded users for doing everyday tasks, like watching videos or reading the news: Mode Mobile. People liked it. Using a custom smartphone, the “EarnOS” lets you stream music and get paid for it, hence the tagline “turning smartphones into earnphones.” Mode Mobile was named as Deloitte’s #1 fastest growing software company, has over 10 million downloads on the Google Play store, and claims to have helped users earn and save over $250 million. More importantly, the model lets brands reach consumers directly… without forking over rent to Google or Facebook.  In the Web2 world this is hard to do. “90% or more of the whole market for advertising is being monopolized by Google, Facebook, and a few other companies,” says Filip Wielanier, co-founder and CEO of Cookie3. “We believe that we should decentralize this kind of distribution.”  This distribution of ads comes from creators. Less Big Tech, more micro-influencers. Creators like singers, comedians, and KOLs would be compensated by the brand, and then the creators would hawk the product. Wielanier’s team is building out the “Cookie3 affiliate” and a Cookie DAO to build this infrastructure.  As Cookie3 described in a recent Twitter/X thread, Web2 marketing is top-down, centralized, and one-way communication. Web3 is bottom-up, tokenized, transparent, and data-driven. Web3 marketing would also solve the vexing problem of, well, cookies.  Your attention is getting spammed by so many different things. And that’s why the cost to acquire users is only going up  It can feel as if we spend half our time on the internet clicking “Accept Cookies.” This has become as mindless as clicking “Accept Terms and Conditions” when downloading software updates. We bristle at being tracked but we click “Yes” because we have no choice. But what’s mildly annoying for you and me is an almost existential problem for digital marketers.  Let’s say you want to serve an ad that targets 21-to-34-year-old males in Kentucky. You don’t waste money spamming the entire United States, so you use cookies to refine your audience. The problem is that cookies are only a clunky workaround. “The cookie is a non-persistent item inside of your browser,” says Chris Outram, Head of Blockchain at Publicis Media. “It’s built for storing log-in data.”  Outram calls cookies “brittle,” as some browsers don’t store cookies, users can refuse cookies, and cookies were never really intended as the key link in a marketing campaign. They’re simply all we have.  With Web3? In theory, says Outram, we’d dramatically change the infrastructure of the internet, swapping these brittle cookies with something more useful – and privacy preserving – to both brands and users alike. The details are still a whopping TBD but this will likely involve zero-knowledge proofs, where you can signal to brands your interests without revealing the rest of your online behavior. “That’s the magic unlock,” says Outram. “We can parse out the data we give as consumers.”  There are other unlocks. From the brand’s perspective, they could reward users with a token that would give true ownership, strengthening that connection. “The moment you can take people and have them be an owner inside of a network, they’re no longer a customer. They’re an ambassador,” says Novaes. “And they talk and act in a very different way.” This is why Novaes’ project now includes the Web3 token $EARNM (as in “Earn’M”). His Web2 goal was to turn users into earners; now his Web3 goal is “to turn earners into owners.”  As anyone who has spent much time in Web3 knows, token-holding can build communities and loyalty. (See: WAGMI.) This is mana for brands. As uber-VC Chris Dixon once said, “When somebody owns something and feels skin in the game, they want to go talk about it. They want to evangelize it.”  Novaes gives a surprising example from his own Mode Mobile and EARNM community. As outlined on its website, users of EARNM can earn prizes such as a Toyota Corolla, a Lamborghini, or even the world’s biggest cookie. But these aren’t the prizes that stand out. Consider “Prize #5: Harness the Power of a Troll Army.”  How does one harness a Troll Army? Novaes explains that his mailing list has over one million people and they are so engaged – so aligned – that they would happily follow instructions and troll an intended target. “If I sent one email to my user base, and I was like, ‘Go on Jeff’s Twitter and put these emojis…’” The army would do it. (Novaes clarifies that the trolling needs to be legal.)  But the trolling isn’t really the point. It’s easy to see how a Troll Campaign could get toxic in the wrong hands – or maybe even the right hands – but the larger takeaway is that the community is hyper-engaged and hyper-loyal. (See also: XRP Army.) Every brand covets this. “You have an army that’s aligned with you,” says Novaes. “That’s really, really powerful.”  This is not to say that Web3 marketing is a silver bullet. It can backfire; it has backfired. “There are aspects of Web3 that are super messed up, and not sustainable,” says Novaes, as some Web3 projects only worked in the short-term by showering users with freebies. Who’s paying for this marketing? Often the rewards come from either a soaring token price or the project’s capital. The problem is that prices can fall and capital runs out. “The Axie Infinity thing will happen over and over again,” says Novaes, predicting that the recent trend of air-drops is “not sustainable.”  Novaes’ project, EARNM, tries to tackle this problem with a clever system of “mystery boxes” as rewards. Instead of just doling out tokens to all, users pay a minting fee to unlock the mystery boxes (which contain different types of prizes), and these minting fees inject revenue into the system and create a deflationary pressure. Then the rewards inside the mystery boxes have different “vesting periods,” intended to make the tokenomics more sustainable.  Philosophical merits of decentralization aside, there’s another very concrete problem with the current state of Web2 marketing: It’s no longer very effective. “It’s hard to cut through the noise,” says Novaes. Let’s say you’re a startup and your new killer product is in the App Store. “If you launch an app, it’s not even a pin-drop,” says Novaes. “People don’t care. Your attention is getting spammed by so many different things. And that’s why the cost to acquire users is only going up.”  Yes, this is all still very theoretical and yes, it’s unclear how regulations and legal concerns will complicate innovation. But it’s also true that new Web3 products – in theory – could give marketers a shiny new tool kit…and something that consumers would actually enjoy.  To illustrate the potential of Web3 marketing, Outram gives the contrasting example of a “hamburger coupon” vs. “whiskey ambassador.” In traditional Web2 marketing you might give a customer a $1 coupon for a hamburger. But that’s boring. Not even hamburger lovers would really care. So imagine this model instead…  “I like whiskey,” says Outram. “And I can prove that I have a really good sense of what good whiskey is. If you’re a high-end whiskey provider, don’t you want me out there in front of your brand?” So how do you prove you know your whiskey? (Most ways of proving your whiskey palate are decidedly offline.)  Thanks to the new tools of Web3, says Outram, perhaps you could show some on-chain proof that you attended a whiskey tasting, or proof that you bought certain barrels.

The change replaces the CEO with a TradFi veteran just months after the company's flagship Bitcoin Trust became an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of digital asset investment firm Grayscale, has stepped down after 10 years at the company to be replaced by a veteran from the world of traditional finance (TradFi) world just months after the company's flagship Bitcoin Trust became an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  Sonnenshein, who became CEO in 2021, will be replaced by Peter Mintzberg, head of strategy for asset and wealth management at Goldman Sachs on Aug. 15, Grayscale said on Monday. Mintzberg has more than 20 years of experience in TradFi, having previously worked at BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds and Invesco. CFO Edward McGee will lead the company on an interim basis until Mintzberg fills the role.  ""Michael guided the firm through exponential growth & oversaw its pivotal role in bringing spot bitcoin ETFs to market, leading the way for the broader financial industry,"" Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale's parent company Digital Currency Group, wrote on X.  In January, Grayscale was one of about a dozen firms to finally have a spot bitcoin ETF approved to list in the U.S. in January. The firm had taken the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the regulator's repeated refusal to allow it to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF.  GBTC saw around $15 billion of outflows in the following three months as the firm kept fees higher than its competitors.

42390823,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMxAD,1716211915,"Will RFK Jr. Debate Trump or Biden? Probably Not, Prediction Market Says","This week in prediction markets…  Will there be a Biden-Trump-Kennedy debate?  When will OpenAI's Sora launch?  It's gone to the cats  Solana vs. Ethereum: Which chain will earn more in fees?  A presidential debate that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. alongside President Biden or Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is unlikely to happen, bettors on crypto-based predictions platform Polymarket are signaling.  ""Yes"" shares in the contract are trading at 27 cents, meaning the market sees a 27% chance of it occurring. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.  The machinations of the American political-industrial complex make it difficult for a third party, or independent candidate, to succeed. Ballot access laws favor major parties, creating significant barriers for third-party candidates. Getting on a debate stage has another high threshold of its own.  Rules for the first debate, scheduled for June 27 on CNN, say that the candidates must appear on enough state ballots to hypothetically reach 270 electoral votes, and also receive 15% in four polls. A second debate on ABC is scheduled for September, and it also has a 15% polling rule.  Currently, RFK Jr. is polling at just under 10% in national polls compiled by 270toWin. Right now his team says they have confirmed ballot access, or are working on it, in enough states to win 201 electoral votes, which is enough to be a spoiler, but not to win the presidency.  But independent candidates have participated in the debates in living memory: in 1992, independent candidate H. Ross Perot appeared on stage alongside George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.  To be clear, the Polymarket contract says that RFK Jr. must participate in a debate including Trump or Biden. It doesn't say that the debate must be an official one.  Trump's campaign wants more debates, according to reports, proposing one per month from June to September, preferring two-hour stand-up debates in larger venues with live audiences.  The current train of thought holds that RFK Jr.'s campaign is more of a threat to Biden than Trump's, and polls that include him give Trump a slight edge, up to 5 points in some.  It's plausible that the Trump campaign could decide to host a streaming debate with the Kennedy campaign, or hold it on a lesser-known network like OANN. It just needs to be a ""publicly broadcast debate"" per Polymarket's rules.  (Don't forget that Kennedy is coming to CoinDesk's Consensus conference, taking the stage on May 31 at 4:30 PM)  When Will OpenAI's Sora Launch?  Sora, OpenAI's text-to-video generator, wowed the world when Sam Altman's company demoed the project back in February.  Missing is a launch date.  Bettors on Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated platform, are predicting that launch will take place sometime between September and the end of 2025, with only a 27% chance it will occur before September.  But there's one thing that's getting in the way of a wide release of Sora: the availability of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Rendering video from text prompts is going to take a lot of them, more, in fact, than many of the world's largest customers of Nvidia have in their data centers.  According to a report by Factorial Funds, OpenAI's Sora faces significant challenges regarding GPU availability, as mainstream adoption of text-to-video generation would require hundreds of thousands of server-grade GPUs at a cost of tens of billions.  Factorial estimates that supporting the creator community of platforms like TikTok and YouTube alone would necessitate around 720,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, far exceeding the combined resources of major tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google.  But remember, the contract isn't asking if Sora will be widely available. A launch with limited availability and a high monthly cost would still count. It's just asking if it will launch.  Pick of the Litter  Punters on Polymarket aren’t expecting any of the best-known cat meme coins to become the first such token to reach the $1 billion market cap milestone.  A market capitalization bet for cat-themed tokens, which some expect to flip their dog-themed counterparts in the next bull cycle, has racked up $1.2 million in bets since going live in March. As of Monday, popular tokens Popcat (POPCAT) and cat in a dogs world (MEW) have 22% and 7% odds, while shark cat (SC) and toshi (TOSHI) have odds of under 2%.  Despite all these memes being valued at over $200 million and occupying massive mindshare in the meme coin community, punters aren’t expecting any of these to become the first billion-dollar cat meme.  Instead, the “others/none in 2024” category dominates the odds at 68%. Other cat-themed tokens in the open market but not referenced in the Polymarket contract are mog (MOG), wen (WEN) and maneki (MANEKI), according to CoinGecko.  The high odds for two distinct outcomes suggest traders either expect a whole other cat meme to become the biggest or expect no single token in the category to get such a rich valuation.  The apparent bearish sentiment is likely not due to the lack of buying pressure, either. Two dog tokens, bonk (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), and the frog-themed pepe (PEPE), were launched in 2023 and zoomed to over $3 billion each in less than a year, showcasing the demand for such tokens.  Among meme coin hunters, the perceived cuteness of a meme drives its virality and, ultimately, price. So which is cuter: a dog with a pink beanie hat or a cat with a mouth that pops? The punters have decided.  Pump.Fun Exploit's ripple effect  A market betting on Solana fees flipping those of Ethereum has fallen 12 points in the past week, after jumping up to 35% earlier in the month.  The “Solana flips ETH in daily fees in May?” market, which has seen over $60,000 in wagers placed, is a market on whether the daily fees of Solana (SOL) will surpass that of Ethereum (ETH) for any day within this market’s time frame from May 10 to May 31.  Odds of the flip rose earlier this month due to a revival of meme coin trading as GameStop stock prices surged higher, aiding growth in meme tokens.  However, the odds fell following a $2 million exploit on Pump.Fun, a tool that lets anyone deploy a tradeable token on Solana. The brief exploit may have been expected by some to slow the rapid issuance of meme coins on Solana, which would in turn depress daily fees.  Despite being extremely cheap compared to Ethereum, the Solana blockchain collects millions of dollars in fees every day thanks to the sheer magnitude of meme coin trading activity on the network.  Still, the fee difference isn’t a big one. Blockchain activity on Ethereum netted it over $1.84 million in the past 24 hours, while it was nearly $1.2 million for Solana, DefiLlama data shows.  Pump.Fun has since come back online, and is seeing thousands of new memes launched daily as usual.

28159289,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608903,1716210047,"If This Happens, Shiba Inu Price Could Double Soon","Last week, Shiba Inu (SHIB) emerged from a bull pennant formation on its daily chart, signaling the potential for a significant price increase. Currently, SHIB’s price is at a critical juncture as it undergoes a retest of the breakout level. If this retest is successful, it could lead to considerable gains. Shiba Inu Price Could Double If This Happens The bull pennant is a continuation pattern that typically signifies a strong uptrend following a period of consolidation. In the daily chart, SHIB/USD showcases a classic bull pennant formation. This pattern consists of two converging trend lines forming a small symmetrical triangle, following a significant price increase. The pole of the pennant represents the initial sharp rise from late February to early March, while the pennant itself formed from March through May. The upper trendline of the pennant acted as resistance multiple times, while the lower trendline provided support just as often. The breakout above the upper trendline occurred on Wednesday last week, and SHIB is currently in a retest phase. This retest is crucial to confirm the validity of the breakout. A successful retest, where the price finds support at the upper boundary of the pennant, could signal a strong continuation of the prior uptrend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Makes Decisive Move: Is Now The Ideal Time To Buy? The key price level to watch is currently around $0.00002350. Further important price levels to monitor include the resistance levels at $0.00002482, which coincides with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level, and the next resistance levels at $0.00002881, $0.00003204, $0.00003527, and $0.00003987. These levels represent the 0.382, 0.5, 0.618, and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement levels, respectively, and are critical targets if the uptrend continues. On the support side, the immediate level to watch is $0.00002220, which aligns with the recent pennant’s lower boundary. Further support can be found at the 200-day EMA, currently at $0.00001854, and the 0 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00001836, marking the lowest point of the recent consolidation phase. Moreover, the 20-day EMA at $0.00002399 and the 50-day EMA at $0.00002418 are crucial for SHIB as they present the next resistance levels. SHIB is currently trading slightly above its 20-day EMA but below the 50-day EMA, indicating mixed short-term momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu to Soar 50% Amidst Meme Coin Market Rise The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.74, close to the neutral 50 mark, suggesting that SHIB is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral stance provides room for potential upward movement without being hindered by overbought conditions. Volume analysis shows a gradual decline during the pennant formation, which is characteristic of this pattern. A significant increase in volume upon a successful retest would be a strong confirmation of the bull pennant. The recent breakout and the current retest phase are critical to watch. A successful retest with increased volume would likely validate the bull pennant pattern and signal the continuation of the uptrend. Potential price targets for SHIB based on the bull pennant, assuming a successful breakout and continuation of the bull pennant pattern, can be estimated based on the height of the initial flagpole. The flagpole, representing the initial sharp rise from approximately $0.00001 to $0.000036, gives a height of around $0.000026. Adding this to the breakout point at $0.00002436, the target price for SHIB is approximately $0.00005036.

42390821,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMwzx,1716206973,"First Mover Americas: BTC, ETH Little Changed Ahead of Ether ETF Decision","This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were little changed, suggesting a consolidation after last week's rally. BTC traded at around $67,000 while ETH held steady about $3,100. The wider digital asset market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has added 0.3% in the last 24 hours. This week, attention will turn to the SEC's decision on the approval of ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the deadline for a response to VanEck's and Ark/21 Shares' applications due on May 23 and May 24, respectively. Traders may be keeping their powder dry until then.  Traders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia's earnings, scheduled for Wednesday. Bitcoin trades strongly in correlation with Nvidia, as do artificial intelligence-themed tokens, which surged in February as the chip designer reported better-than-expected earnings. NVDA has risen over 90% year-to-date, with analysts expecting the company to report a big increase in revenue for the quarter ending in April. The direct correlation between Nvidia and ether market movement isn't as strong as it once was during the mining boom. Still, the rising tide of bitcoin and AI tokens – should Nvidia's earnings remain strong – will likely lift all boats.  Genesis will return 77% of customer assets, worth $3 billion in cash and crypto, to its creditors. Parent company DCG will not be among them. The lender's holding company filed for bankruptcy in January 2023 following the fallout from events in the crypto market the year before. In the immediate aftermath of the filing, the market was skeptical that customers would be made whole and the bankruptcy proceedings would be completed in an expedient manner. Bankruptcy claims marketplace Xclaim initially listed Genesis claims at 35% of their value in January 2023. As of today, Genesis claims for bitcoin or ether are trading at 97%-110% for claims over $10 million, while claims under $1 million are trading at 74%-94%.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the ratio between Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, and the broader S&P 500 index.  The ratio has moved past a five-month-long descending trendline, signaling Nasdaq outperformance ahead.  Since 2016, the inflow of money into the crypto market has been at least partly contingent on optimism toward technology stocks relative to the broader market.

42390808,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMvq9,1716204943,"Craig Wright Lied to UK Court 'Extensively and Repeatedly,' Judge Writes","Craig Wright lied extensively in his evidence during a U.K. court case regarding his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, according to the written judgment.  Most of the lies related to forged documents that purported to support his claim, the judge wrote.  Craig Wright lied ""extensively and repeatedly"" in both his written and oral evidence in the Crypto Open Patent Alliance case regarding his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, Judge James Mellor said in his written judgement on Monday.  Mellor also concluded that the issue of injunctive relief - a legal remedy to stop a defendant from doing something - will be argued at a Form of Order hearing that will be appointed after the judgment has been handed down.  Mellor in March concluded Wright was not Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, and that he had not authored the cryptocurrency's foundational document known as the white paper.  ""I want to thank those of you who sent me messages of support yesterday. I await the written judgment at which point I will consider my options for appeal,” Wright said on X (formally known as Twitter) in March.  Although the ruling can be appealed, Mellor’s definitive statement following the month-long trial was cause for celebration for the broader crypto industry, which has long criticized and been victim to Wright’s legal battles against members of the community.  “Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011. Third, Dr. Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System. And, fourth, he is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software,” Mellor said after both parties to the trial had presented their evidence.  The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), whose stated mission is to protect the adoption of crypto and fight threats against the new technology, filed to take Wright to court in 2021. The trial commenced on Feb. 5, with COPA accusing Wright of forgery and, later, perjury.  ""I am entirely satisfied that Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly,"" Mellor said. ""Most of his lies related to the documents he had forged which purported to support his claim.""  COPA, whose backers include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), said it will seek several injunctions to prevent Wright from claiming to be Nakamoto and taking Bitcoin developers to court again.  It has also said it may ask U.K. prosecutors to consider perjury charges against Wright for statements made during the trial.  ""Dr Wright’s attempts to prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto represent a most serious abuse of this Court’s process,"" Mellor said in his judgment. ""The same point applies to other jurisdictions as well: Norway in particular."" Wright also had a nearly five year long legal battle against Norwegian bitcoiner Hodlonaut.  In March, Mellor imposed a worldwide freezing order on 6 million British pounds ($7.6 million) worth of Wright assets to ensure he couldn't move them offshore or evade costs from the COPA trial. According to the order, COPA's costs for the case amounted to 6.7 million pounds at the time.

28155970,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608904,1716204638,Bitcoin Rally Incoming: This Major BTC Metric Just Turned Bullish Once Again,"A crucial Bitcoin metric has just turned bullish, sparking optimism from a crypto analyst regarding an impending rally for Bitcoin. This unique technical pattern suggests that the world’s largest cryptocurrency could see its price ascending further, potentially kick-starting a highly welcomed bull run this cycle. Bitcoin Technical Pattern Flips Bullish Bitcoin’s price has often followed distinct historical patterns, with the majority of these indicators preceding significant rallies or bearish trends. One of the most compelling signs that Bitcoin may be turning bullish again is seen as the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator breaks below the lower Bollinger Bands, a technical indicator used to measure a market’s volatility and momentum. Related Reading: Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run According to a crypto analyst identified as ‘Dominando Cripto’ on X (formerly Twitter), the SSR is a unique technical tool designed to evaluate the market sentiment by comparing the supply of stablecoins to Bitcoin. This tool is used by analysts and traders to identify buying and selling opportunities for Bitcoin. Additionally, it quantifies how the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the SSR moves within the Bollinger Bands. Dominando Cripto has provided an in-depth explanation of how the SSR oscillator is calculated and how to interpret its signals for identifying bullish trends. “The oscillator is calculated by taking the difference between the current Stablecoin Supply Ratio value and its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), then dividing it by the standard deviation of the SSR over the same period,” the analyst stated. Sharing a price chart depicting movements of the SSR oscillator, the crypto analyst suggests that when the oscillator moves above the upper Bollinger Bands, it suggests that the SSR is significantly higher than normal levels. This indicates that stablecoins are dominating the market, signaling bearish sentiment and a potential downturn for Bitcoin. Conversely, when the oscillator falls below the lower Bollinger Band, it indicates that the SSR is low, highlighting the reduced dominance of stablecoins and signaling bullish sentiment that could potentially trigger an incoming rally in Bitcoin. In the above price chart, Dominando Crypto pinpointed several instances when the SSR oscillator displayed bearish and bullish sentiment, identifying these periods as heated zones and cold zones, respectively. Recent market movements indicate that the SSR oscillator is in the cold zone, indicating a potential bullish outlook for Bitcoin. More Bullish Signs For BTC On May 18, Blockchain analytics platform, Santiment, revealed a new market trend where small traders are consistently liquidating their BTC holdings, even as the cryptocurrency has shown positive performance lately. Related Reading: This Crypto Trader Just Sold All His Bitcoin For Altcoins Like Cardano And XRP, Here’s Why The analytics platform noted that historically, when small wallets dump coins into larger wallets, it is considered an encouraging sign for Bitcoin, indicating a potential bullish turnaround for the pioneer cryptocurrency.

Acquisitions should boost the company’s total capacity to over 24 EH/s once fully operational. However, the economics of Bitcoin mining pose challenges, as the amount of Bitcoin mined decreases over time despite increased computational capacity. I was wrong on CleanSpark ( CLSK ). At the time I wrote my article almost 4 years ago, I was bullish on Bitcoin. CleanSpark, at the time, was a technology solutions provider for the energy industry. My thinking was that by using as cheap an energy source as possible, the company could easily profitably mine Bitcoin. That did not pan out, as the economics of Bitcoin mining are pretty difficult. The company has since exited the energy business, becoming a pure-play Bitcoin miner, and I have become much more bearish. CleanSpark Grows By Acquisition Looking at CleanSpark’s Q2 2024 results (the company has a different fiscal year), it can be seen that the firm has achieved some significant wins. The company more than doubled its revenues from $42.5 million to $111.8 million. The company mined 2,031 bitcoins this quarter with an average price of $55,029 compared to the 1,871 bitcoins the same time last year with an average price of $22,706. The increase in mined BTC was due to the increase in the number of miners in operation, which increases the company’s hashrate. The hashrate is the computational power that when combined with the global hashrate determines the number of BTC CleanSpark can mine. This increase in hashrate was largely due to the company expanding its operational capacity via acquisitions. Operational capacity increased by 60% due to two bitcoin mining acquisitions in Mississippi and Georgia. Last February, CleanSpark acquired three turnkey bitcoin mining Mississippi facilities for $19.8 million in cash. These facilities had a combined operational hashrate of 2.4 EH/s . The additional Georgia facility, on the other hand, cost $6.9 million in total and has a target hashrate of 0.8 EH/s. Within the Georgia facility, CleanSpark is also making expansions to boost output. The expansion will consist of a 15MW facility running a fleet of S21s. Once complete, this expansion will add another 0.8 exahashes per second (EH/s) to the company’s total capacity. The total capacity for the company’s Georgia facility (which includes existing, acquisition, and expansion) is 2.4 EH/s. The company continues to go on its buying spree, as it recently announced that it will acquire two Bitcoin mining locations in Wyoming for a cash payment of $18.75 million. These facilities have 75 MW of available power and are targeted to add 4 EH/s to CleanSpark’s operations. According to the press release, the company “ plans to deploy a combination of S21 and S21 pros, the most powerful and efficient generation of bitcoin mining machines, from orders placed and fully funded earlier this year ”. These acquisitions should boost the company’s total capacity to over 24 EH/s once fully operational. These acquisitions are especially important post-halving, as existing facilities will now be able to only mine half as much Bitcoin as they used to. While all these acquisitions are good, it shows that the company is inorganically growing its revenues. It demonstrates the impact that the halving has in terms of Bitcoin mined. In other words, there is a race to continue to expand operational capacity while not necessarily getting more Bitcoin out of it. Author table from company data CLSK Quarterly Results Analysis Looking at the rest of the financial data for CleanSpark’s latest quarter , we can see that the company is in a good place. CleanSpark has an ample amount of liquidity as the company has total current assets of $687.8 million, which is comprised of $323.1 million in cash position and $358.0 million in Bitcoin. This is much higher than the company’s long-term debt of $12.8 million of debt. This strong balance sheet puts the company in a prime spot should it want to pursue additional acquisitions. On the income front, CleanSpark had a Net Income of $126.7 million or $0.59 basic income per share for the quarter. This was a massive improvement from the loss of ($18.5) million or ($0.23) loss per share at the same time last year. Adjusted EBITDA surged year-over-year from $12.7 million to $181.8 million. The company’s Net Income gains are driven by the rise in operational capacity as well as the surge in Bitcoin prices. The former, i.e. operational capacity increase, is driven by capital expenditures. In a vacuum, this all works fine, however, given the unique economics of Bitcoin mining makes this business model challenging. The More Bitcoin is Mined, The less you get for Mining The fundamental long-term problem with Bitcoin mining in general is that over time you get less Bitcoin mined even as computational capacity increases. This is because the more Bitcoin is mined, the less Bitcoin is received as rewards for mining. This factor is apart from the Bitcoin “halving” which occurs roughly every four years when the reward for each block of Bitcoin mined is cut in half. The most recent halving event took place on April 19 where the reward for each Bitcoin block was reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. We can see this play out when we examine CleanSpark’s Bitcoin updates for January , February , March , and April this year. Looking at the table below, it can be seen that the number of Bitcoin mined from January to March has been increasing as the company’s hashrate increases. From 577 Bitcoin mined to 806 Bitcoin mined respectively. However in April, despite having the highest hashrate of 17.3 EH/s the amount of Bitcoin mined was less than in March. This was having the post-halving rewards for 1/3 of the month, as the halving occurred on April 19th. The next update for May will show how much Bitcoin we can expect CleanSpark to mine post-halving. In other words, I believe that despite all the money CleanSpark spent on acquisitions, the actual number of Bitcoin mined might not see much of an improvement. Author table from company data Conclusion Putting all these together, what I am saying is that CleanSpark, like other Bitcoin miners, will have to continuously spend money to even maintain its present number of Bitcoin mined. The company is going on an aggressive acquisition spree. However, time will tell if it is able to constantly maintain its number of Bitcoins mined. Therefore, I have always believed that in the long-term, investors are better off simply buying Bitcoin itself through one of the many now available ETFs. The key risk to my thesis though is that many other smaller bitcoin miners would go out of business. This would reduce worldwide hashrate letting the remaining miners earn more rewards. In this scenario, CleanSpark would be able to acquire these much smaller miners at a favorable price. However, I still view Bitcoin mining to be difficult to profit long-term due to the halving events as well as being wholly dependent on Bitcoin prices. Even putting aside my bearish view of the business model, CleanSpark is trading at unattractive valuations. The company is trading at a TTM P/E of 39.86x and a forward P/E of 29.15x. The company’s TTM P/E is higher than the sector median TTM P/E of 30.70 and its forward P/E is at the median of the IT sector of 29.73x forward P/E. Even comparing to its direct Bitcoin mining peers, CleanSpark on forecast year 2 has a P/E of 68.7x, which is higher than Marathon Digital ( MARA ) or Riot Platforms ( RIOT ). The unattractive business model and the higher valuation makes this company a “Sell” rating for me.

28157193,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608915,1716196814,Litecoin Put To The Test: Can LTC Break Through $94?,"Litecoin (LTC), the cryptocurrency often dubbed “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” has left investors scratching their heads this week. After a brief surge, LTC finds itself stuck in a price tug-of-war, with analysts divided on whether it will climb to $90 or fall back to its support level near $80. Related Reading: Bitcoin Boom: Price Explodes Past $67,000 As Investor Confidence Returns Mixed Signals Cloud Litecoin’s Future Last week’s price action for LTC was a rollercoaster ride – not the kind that sends investors screaming with joy, but a slow, rickety climb followed by a disappointing stall. Despite breaking the $80 barrier on May 15th, LTC’s momentum fizzled out, leaving it hovering around $83.81 at press time. Popular crypto analyst, CRYPTOWZRD, isn’t mincing words. Their recent tweet paints a picture of indecision, with LTC trapped in a price range between $80 and $94. A breakout, either bullish or bearish, seems imminent, but the direction remains a mystery. LTC Daily Technical Outlook:$LTC closed indecisively today and it is trading in the middle of a Daily range area. I will pay more attention to the intraday chart development tomorrow to get a quick scalp 👀 pic.twitter.com/T5hAFTndIu — CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) May 19, 2024 To decipher LTC’s next move, analysts are turning to on-chain metrics – the digital breadcrumbs left behind by cryptocurrency transactions. Here, too, the picture is far from clear. Glassnode’s NVT ratio, a measure of undervaluation, is flashing red, suggesting a potential price dip. However, a low reserve risk metric hints at an upcoming surge in bullish sentiment. Whale activity, often a bullish indicator, remains high, and the MVRV ratio, which gauges profitability for long-term holders, has also taken an upward turn. Litecoin: Technical Indicators Offer Tentative Hope Meanwhile, technical indicators offer a glimmer of hope for LTC bulls. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits comfortably above the neutral mark, suggesting the coin isn’t overbought. One damper on the party spirit comes from the Bollinger Bands, a volatility indicator. LTC’s current position within the bands suggests a period of low volatility, making a sudden price surge less likely. This subdued volatility is significant because Bollinger Bands typically tighten when market prices consolidate, signaling a lack of strong directional movement. For LTC, this means that without an external catalyst to drive momentum, the likelihood of a dramatic price breakout is diminished. Related Reading: Solana Blasts Past Resistance: Buckle Up For $330 Breakout – Analyst Crucial Levels: The $80-$85 Tightrope Walk For LTC to reach its holy grail of $90, it needs to conquer a crucial resistance level at $85. This hurdle could be particularly challenging due to potential liquidations that might occur at that price point. On the downside, if LTC fails to hold its ground at the $80 support level, a price drop to $78 could be on the cards.

28148308,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608868,1716192944,4 Key Reasons Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Is Far From Over,"In an analysis shared via X, renowned crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) has provided compelling evidence to support his assertion that the current Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Ted’s insights are based on four critical indicators related to traditional finance and crypto liquidity, each pointing to sustained growth in the near future. Here’s a breakdown of his analysis: #1 65-Month Liquidity Cycle Ted highlights the 65-month liquidity cycle, a historical pattern that marks the ebb and flow of liquidity in financial markets. According to his analysis, this cycle bottomed out in October 2023, signaling the beginning of a new expansion phase. Related Reading: Most Important Bitcoin Indicator Nears Bullish Flip: $150,000 Soon? “We are now in the expansion phase, which is expected to peak in 2026,” Ted stated. This projection aligns with the anticipated easing by central banks in response to slowing economic data over the next 18 to 24 months. Historically, increased liquidity has been a precursor to bull markets in various asset classes, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. #2 M2 Money Supply The M2 money supply, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, is another crucial indicator, if not the most important indicator of global liquidity. Ted notes that the rate of expansion in the M2 money supply is at its lowest since the 1990s. “There is plenty of room to the upside for easing liquidity conditions,” he explained. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies to stimulate economies, increased M2 growth could lead to more capital flowing into risk assets like Bitcoin. #3 Crypto Liquidity While liquidity has returned to the crypto markets, particularly with the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ted points out that the velocity of inflows has not yet reached the levels seen at cycle tops. “The velocity of inflow has not yet seen a manic phase consistent with cycle tops,” he noted. Related Reading: Tether Adds Fresh $1 Billion USDT To Supply – Bitcoin To Rally Again? This suggests that while interest and investment in Bitcoin are growing, the market has not yet reached the speculative frenzy that typically precedes a major correction. This phase of measured inflow can provide a more stable foundation for continued price increases. #4 Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows The US based spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, with last week alone witnessing $950 million flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, the largest net inflow since March. Ted expects these inflows to increase as Bitcoin’s price rises and traditional finance investors regain confidence in the asset. “Expect these to only increase as price drifts higher and tradFi once again renew faith in the asset,” he stated. The growing acceptance and investment from institutional investors via ETFs are a strong bullish indicator for Bitcoin’s continued ascent. Each of these factors points to a sustained and robust bull market for Bitcoin. Ted’s analysis, grounded in traditional financial indicators and crypto-specific data, provides a comprehensive outlook on the current and future state of the Bitcoin market. As central banks potentially ease monetary policies and institutional interest continues to grow, the conditions appear ripe for Bitcoin’s bull run to extend well into the coming years. At press time, BTC traded at $66,602.

28145930,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608871,1716189293,XRP Holders In Panic Selling Frenzy? Sub-$0.50 Looms,"The price of XRP, the native token of Ripple, seems to be teetering on the edge of a short-term decline, according to an analysis of on-chain data by NewsBTC. While bulls might want to hold their horses, the report paints a picture of a market potentially succumbing to selling pressure in the immediate future. Related Reading: Solana Blasts Past Resistance: Buckle Up For $330 Breakout – Analyst Whales Shedding Weight: A Bearish Signal? The report raises a red flag with the movement of XRP in large wallets. Investors holding between 100,000 and 1 million XRP have been noticeably reducing their holdings. This suggests a potential increase in sell pressure, as these “whales” unload their tokens onto the market. The combined holdings of this group now represent a smaller percentage of the total circulating supply, which could lead to a temporary glut of XRP and a corresponding price drop. The behavior of these large XRP holders could indicate a shift in market sentiment, prompting concerns about the future stability of XRP prices. As these whales liquidate their positions, the market could face increased volatility, with prices reacting sharply to the influx of sell orders. Additionally, the reduction in whale holdings might signal a lack of confidence in XRP’s short-term prospects, potentially discouraging smaller investors from maintaining or increasing their positions. The price of XRP managed to shift from $0.48 to $0.52 in a few days last week. The token has been wiping out some of those gains, though. The token’s price may drop below $0.50 because to the decrease in balances. The effect was already in action because the token’s value was $0.51 at the time of publication. OI And Active Addresses: Not Shining A Bullish Light Further dampening the enthusiasm for XRP is the Open Interest (OI) metric. OI refers to the total value of all open positions in XRP futures contracts. A decrease in OI, as observed recently, signifies a decline in market activity and potentially more sellers closing their positions. This trend aligns with the dwindling number of active addresses on the XRP network. Active addresses represent the unique number of wallets involved in XRP transfers within a specific timeframe. A recent drop in active addresses suggests a decrease in overall market participation, which can often precede a price slump. Related Reading: ADA Price Surge Could Push Ratio Of Holders In Loss Below 55% Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword A silver lining some might see is the recent spike in XRP’s one-day volatility. Volatility can be a double-edged sword, however. While it can indicate heightened market activity and potentially lead to price surges, the current situation seems to be leaning towards the opposite. The rise in volatility, coupled with the selling pressure and declining participation, might simply reinforce a downtrend rather than spark a price increase.

Traders are looking at the ETH ETF decision, and Nvidia earnings this week.  The crypto market was listless early Monday, with bitcoin {{BTC}}, the biggest digital asset market by value, trading flat at $67,156 and ether {{ETH}} changing hands at $3,127, according to CoinDesk Indices data.  The consolidation follows a week of bullish action triggered by renewed optimism about a U.S. rate cut and the rally in stocks.  Things could soon get busier again with the first decisions for ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due. The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to weigh in on VanEck's ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 23 and the Ark/21 Shares one on May 24, as well as Nvidia earnings.  March Zheng, managing partner of Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview that while the market has priced near the certainty of a rejection, there are still some reasons to be optimistic.  ""There are reasons to believe that the report will contain silver linings for the delay, which should signal an eventual approval of Ethereum in the next year,"" Zheng said. ""The removal of staking prepositions by filers reclassifies underlying ETH as commodities supported by the CFTC and can pave a major pathway going forward.""  Polymarket currently gives a 10% chance of an ether ETF being approved by May 31, a 13% chance of approval by June 30, and a 28% chance of approval this year.  Recently, Coinbase analyst David Han wrote that the market may be ""underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval.""  Zheng argued that positive ETH ETF news might also boost trading sentiments for BASE, a Layer-2 network, whose native token's price has dropped by nearly 25% in the last two weeks.  Traders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia's earnings, scheduled for Wednesday.  Bitcoin trades strongly in correlation with Nvidia, as do Artificial intelligence-themed tokens, which surged in February as the chip designer reported better-than-expected earnings.  The direct correlation between Nvidia and ether market movement isn't as strong as it once was during the mining boom.

42390814,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMwFn,1716186831,Research Firm Favors Bitcoin 'Covered Strangle' Strategy to Enhance Portfolio Yield by 17%,"10x Research suggests selling out-of-the-money (OTM) call and put options tied to bitcoin while holding the cryptocurrency in the spot market.  The so-called covered strangle strategy will generate a 17% yield, in addition to the upside from the spot market holding  Bitcoin {{BTC}} investors looking to generate extra income in addition to their spot market holdings should consider setting a ""covered strangle"" options strategy, research firm 10X, which has an impeccable record of predicting market trends, said Monday.  The 'covered strangle' strategy involves holding the underlying asset in the spot market and simultaneously selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call option at levels (known as strikes in options parlance) above the underlying asset's going market rate and selling an OTM put at strikes below the underlying's spot market price.  The premium received for selling/shorting the call option, or protecting the counterparty from price rallies, and selling the put or insurance against downtrends, represents the extra yield.  10x suggests selling a $100,000 strike call, which is 50% above BTC's current market price, and a $50,000 strike put, both expiring in December 2024, while holding the cryptocurrency in the spot market.  ""Our favorite strategy is to buy bitcoin Spot, Sell 100,000 strike call, and Sell 50,000 strike put for the December 2024 expiry. Selling the call could yield 11%, and selling the put could yield 6%,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in Monday's client note, detailing the suggestion.  ""Hence, this strategy provides us with either a 17% downside buffer or 17% more yield, depending on where BTC closes in December, plus we would capture all the upside (or downside) for bitcoin,"" Thielen added.  The strategy is preferred when the market outlook is bullish, but the uptrend is expected to unfold slowly, keeping implied volatility or investors' expectations for price turbulence low. In such conditions, options, particularly OTM call and put options, bleed value faster as expiry nears, making money for sellers.  The strategy, though appealing, is now without risks and requires a high tolerance for risk. That's because the risk is leveraged below the level at which the put option is sold, in this case, $50,000.  ""Below the lower strike price, both the long stock and short put incur losses, and, as a result, percentage losses are twice what they would be for a covered call position [buy spot = sell OTM call] alone,"" Fidelity said in a 'covered strangle"" explainer.  In other words, 10x's strategy is for those who believe bitcoin's bull market will progress slowly and corrections, if any, will not see prices drop below $50,000. As of writing, bitcoin changed hands at $67,170, representing a 58% year-to-date gain, CoinDesk data show.  Several analysts, including Thielen and Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, expect a slow grind higher.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/20/research-firm-favors-bitcoin-covered-strangle-strategy-to-enhance-portfolio-yield-by-17,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e0f1cb52b4f7a11ef8fb0c1d09d0fec723a06d5-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390833,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdMwup,1716184078,Genesis Set to Return $3B Customer Assets in Finalized Bankruptcy Liquidation Plan,"Genesis will return 77% of customer assets, worth $3 billion, in a court-approved liquidation plan  Bankruptcy claim trading platforms were initially pricing in 35% of claims would be repaid shortly after the insolvency was announced  Digital Currency Group (DCG) will not be among the entities receiving a payout  Genesis recently secured court approval to distribute $3 billion in cash and crypto to its creditors, according to a recent filing, representing approximately 77% of the value of customer claims – however Digital Currency Group (DCG) will not be included in the list of entities paid out.  Genesis Global Holdco LLC, the holding company of Genesis, and its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York in January 2023 due to significant losses from the collapses of Three Arrows Capital and FTX, with over $3.5 billion owed to its top 50 creditors.  In the immediate aftermath of the filing, the market was skeptical that customers would be made whole and the bankruptcy proceedings would be completed in an expedient manner. Bankruptcy claim marketplace Xclaim initially listed Genesis claims at 35% of their value in January 2023.  As of today, Genesis claims for bitcoin or ether are trading between 97-110% for claims over $10 million, while claims under $1 million are trading for between 74-94%.  Claims for fiat currency or stablecoins in Genesis accounts are trading between 89-91% for accounts worth between $1-10 million, and between 73-88% for claims under $1 million.  DCG, the parent company of Genesis, will not be paid out in the proceedings.  ""The record here clearly establishes that there is not sufficient value in the Debtors’ estates to provide DCG a recovery as equity holder after unsecured creditors are paid,"" Judge Sean Lane wrote in the filing. ""Given the size of the creditor claims, DCG is out of the money as an equity holder by billions of dollars, even if the Court valued creditor claims using the method DCG proposes.""  DCG had previously argued for customer claims to be capped at the value of cryptocurrencies as of January 2023, which they believed would allow for full repayment to customers and potentially a recovery for DCG.  In the filing, Judge Lane noted that DCG assumed $1.1 billion of Genesis's debt from the Three Arrows Capital collapse with a 10-year promissory note, but this illiquid obligation did not cover the losses, leading to scrutiny of DCG's financial practices.  DCG and Genesis also had credit lines between the two companies, and Genesis ended up suing DCG over claims that the company missed payments on the loans it took.  DCG and Genesis announced in November 2023 that the two companies have reached a repayment plan, with DCG having paid off the entire loan as of January 6.  UPDATE (May 21, 01:30 UTC): This article has been updated to indicate that DCG had paid off the entire loan as of January 6.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/20/genesis-set-to-return-3b-customer-assets-in-finalized-bankruptcy-liquidation-plan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19cf4e8c12333e1f777e296c94fdf410953f9844-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
