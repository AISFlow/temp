42425770,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg5Fh,1402521925,International Federation of Accountants: Bitcoin Could Reshape Financial Ethics,"A new essay from the CEO of the International Federation of Accountants, an organization that boasts more than 2.5 million accountants and 179 member-organizations among its ranks, suggests that there is a growing belief in the industry that bitcoin technology could revolutionize fiscal and corporate governance.  The article, penned by IFAC CEO Fayez Choudhury, posits that bitcoin presents both opportunities and challenges for accountants, and argues that accountants are uniquely placed to help determine the role that bitcoin will play in global finance.  Choudhury suggests that bitcoin could reshape corporate financial ethics, saying:  ""The traceability of transactions and nearly all forms of record-keeping tied to them could actually reduce fraud and force those in key financial roles to ensure responsible behavior in ways that ethical codes cannot.""  Ultimately, Choudhury issues a call for accountants to become more engaged with bitcoin to ensure that if the technology succeeds — which he says isn’t guaranteed, the broader economy is equipped to maximize its potential.  Revolution in financial trust  Choudhury points to the block chain as a transformative innovation, suggesting that digital currencies could change how trust exists in finance.  He explains:  ""As the bitcoin system relies more upon cryptographic proof than on human trust, its transparent processes may eventually require different audit procedures, given the complexity of the technological environment.""  Choudhury goes on to say that many areas of both consumer and business finance could be enhanced with bitcoin technology. He notes that investor accountability and consumer protection, in particular, could benefit from digital currencies.  Bitcoin may also lead to the development of novel business models, he says. It is for this reason that accountants need to educate themselves on bitcoin to ensure that fair corporate practices are upheld if and when digital currencies become more broadly integrated.  Challenges could undo digital currencies  Choudhury cites fraud and transaction controls as areas where bitcoin's underlying technology could prove to be ineffective as a corporate finance tool.  He writes:  ""Bitcoin poses challenges that impact the financial reporting supply chain — including accountants, auditors and those in financial leadership positions.""  With the block chain existing as a public entity, companies may be able to piece together financial transactions from competitors. Saying that ""anyone can monitor this information"", Choudhury states that corporate treasurers would need to create additional internal controls to ensure that bitcoins are properly maintained.  Additionally, he says that regulatory uncertainty in the areas of taxation, as well as the volatility in the price of bitcoin, may prevent some major players from getting involved.  Technology 'here to stay'  Choudhury concludes by saying that bitcoin technology is already beginning to have a transformative impact on corporate finance.  At this point, he argues, it doesn’t matter if bitcoin actually succeeds long term, saying:  ""There already are other virtual currencies on the rise and competing for market share. Given the challenges and opportunities — and the accountancy profession’s linkages with these issues — shouldn’t we be involved in the debates that shape the innovation, use and regulation of cyber-currencies?""  Choudhury concludes by stating that bitcoin is already bringing about change. He adds that whether or not companies and governments embrace the technology could depend on the role that accountants play in the spread of digital currencies.

42425755,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg4vh,1402516541,Bitcoin Foundation Board Member Elizabeth Ploshay Joins BitPay,"Elizabeth Ploshay, communications director for Bitcoin Magazine and an elected board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, is leaving the publication to join the account management team at BitPay.  Ploshay's new position at BitPay was announced on the company's official blog. In her capacity as Account Manager, Ploshay will work to enroll more charitable organizations and political campaigns in the bitcoin ecosystem.  The addition of Ploshay to BitPay's account management team represents yet another high-profile talent acquisition by the company. Earlier this week, BitPay announced that former Visa exec Tim Byun would serve as its new chief compliance officer.  In a statement on the BitPay blog, Ploshay wrote:  ""I look forward to investing my time with this strong team to spread awareness about the numerous benefits of bitcoin.""  Ploshay's push for bitcoin charity  Speaking at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami earlier this year, Ploshay stumped for bitcoin use in charitable giving. ""Bitcoin is definitely a tool for empowerment,"" she told the audience.  Bitcoin enables non-profits to conduct financial transactions more easily, and often times, it may be cheaper to send funds to those in need.  Ploshay indicated in her BitPay statement that her focus would be to increase awareness of these benefits among nonprofit organizations and campaigns.  She said:  ""I mainly will be seeking to get nonprofits, charities and political organizations on board to start accepting bitcoin donations.""  Ploshay is also a donor and volunteer for the BitGive Foundation. The nonprofit seeks to aid charitable organizations by launching bitcoin fundraising campaigns. Bitgive recently held a bowling tournament with bitcoin companies to facilitate those efforts.  A political focus for bitcoin  Last September, Ploshay was elected along with Micky Malka to the Bitcoin Foundation's board of directors. At the time, Ploshay leveraged her background as a US congressional staffer to prove to Foundation voters that she had the policy experience necessary to be effective.  In her statement, Ploshay expressed plans to use this background to help BitPay become a processor of choice for political campaigns, saying:  ""With the upcoming mid-term election, I hope to use my experience as a former Congressional Staffer in Washington, DC to bring bitcoin, and BitPay, into as many political campaigns as possible.""  Bitcoin has already begun to have an impact on US politics, and fundraising efforts for political campaigns in particular.  US Congressman Jared Polis announced in May that he would accept bitcoin donations, and is one of a group of politicians who have embraced the digital currency.

42425751,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg4ph,1402512954,Rock Group Mastodon Latest Music Act to Accept Bitcoin,"Yet another major musical act has announced that it will accept bitcoin as a form of payment for its latest work.  Mastodon, a US metal band on Warner Bros. Records, will release their new album, 'Once More ’Round The Sun', on 24th June. BitPay will act as the payments processor, enabling fans to order copies via the band’s official website using bitcoin, with pre-orders in the digital currency now also possible.  The album is the latest entry in a growing list of projects being made available for purchase with digital currency. Noted recording artists 50 Cent and former Spice Girl Mel B are among others who have tapped bitcoin as a new way for consumers to buy and experience music.  Mastodon announced the move via their Twitter account:    We're pleased to announce we'll be accepting @Bitcoin to pre-order our new album Once More 'Round The Sun at http://t.co/W4STGJOeRH.      — Mastodon (@mastodonmusic) June 11, 2014    Timed with world tour  'Once More ’Round The Sun' is Mastodon’s sixth studio album, following 'The Hunter' in 2011 and 'Crack the Skye' in 2009. The band has been nominated for two Grammy Awards, and has won other accolades for its unique metal sound.  Mastodon, based in Georgia and founded in 2000, are embarking on a world tour with stops in Europe, Asia and North America. The tour begins on 11th June and ends on the 12th September in Chicago, Illinois.  In a statement, Mastodon said that taking bitcoin payments is part of its broader effort to get music out to fans in new and relevant ways.  The band remarked:  ""We're excited to work with fellow Atlanta-natives BitPay for our new album. We want to give our fans as many options to buy our new album as possible, and are happy that bitcoin can be one of those choices.""  Musicians embrace bitcoin  In addition to Mastodon and 50 Cent, other performing and recording artists have looked to bitcoin to connect with tech-savvy fans, with some even mentioning bitcoin in songs and videos.  The digital currency has also found its way into concert scene. This summer, Budweiser and Coinbase are partnering to bring bitcoin payments to the beermaker’s Budweiser Made In America concert series. One promotional element involves the distribution of $10 in bitcoin to eligible participants who sign up for a Coinbase wallet.  On the grassroots level, bitcoin continues to make gains in the music scene as well. In the past few months, technology developers have built and debuted new platforms to crowdfund musical acts and enable artist tipping.

42425761,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg53h,1402511422,Isle of Man Launches Digital Currency Startup Incubator,"A group of Isle of Man businesses has launched an incubator for digital currency startups.  Six companies, ranging from an accountancy firm to a broadband provider, now offer free or discounted services for startups working on bitcoin or other digital currencies.  The incubator launch follows the island government's announcement that it would seek to regulate digital currencies in a way that is favourable for companies working with the technology. To that end, the government is working on legislation that would be included under existing laws.  Open to all  The digital currency incubator, perhaps fittingly, is decentralised, and startups that want to take advantage of its services can contact the providers directly for an informal assessment.  ""Anybody is allowed to come here and they can choose from the services on offer,"" said R Paul Davis, general counsel at Counting House, one of the service providers.  Other companies offering services as part of the scheme are business support provider Dixcart, accounting firm KPMG, recruitment agency Hamblin Employment Group, the national postal service Isle of Man Post and broadband provider Wi-Manx.  Wi-Manx, for example, will offer free engineering time, discounted contracts for data hosting and telephony services. It will also accept payment in bitcoin. Any startup that wants to take advantage of the services will be required to go through an informal screening with the company.  Managing director Joe Hughes explained:  ""We don't want to burden the companies during their development phase. It would just be a case of chatting with the [startup] and if it all sounds good we'll go with it. We'll take everyone based on merit.""  Startups in the incubator can take advantage of discounted office space and short leases in Britannia House, a popular startup hub on the island, offered by Dixcart.  Favourable environment  The Isle of Man is increasingly attempting to position itself as a hotspot for bitcoin businesses, thanks to its favourable regulatory environment and a business community eager for new, bitcoin-powered transplants.  The British Crown dependency, which is also known for hosting the legendary Isle of Man TT motorcycle race annually, has a technology sector that's populated with firms in the online gambling industry. Some of those firms and their software developers are now turning their attention to digital currencies.  ""Historically, online poker was the big draw, and that extended to bingo and betting. You've now got an ecosystem of software developers and fair regulation guarantees, so a lot of the framework is already there to lend itself to digital currency businesses,"" Hughes said.  According to Davis, there has already been an influx of inquiries to the incubator's professional service providers. His firm, for example, is signing up one or two new clients, focused on digital currency, a week.  ""This is the biggest opportunity for the Isle of Man since gaming moved here. Bitcoin may be the digital currency of the future or it may not, but we are the ideal place for the technology to call home,"" he said.

42425774,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg5Nh,1402506846,Google Joins Yahoo in Offering Bitcoin Prices,"UPDATE (12th June 17:30 BST): A spokesperson from Google said: ""We added a number of currencies to Google Finance, from the Icelandic króna to the East Caribbean dollar to Bitcoin. We're always working to provide more of the financial data people are looking for.""      Google Finance has launched a bitcoin price tracker, offering market information across several major fiat currencies as well as access to breaking news in the digital currency world.  Users can access prices in BTC/USD markets, as well as prices in pound sterling, yen, euro, renminbi, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar markets.  The tool also enables review of historical prices dating back to June 2013.  The Google Finance bitcoin tool enables quick BTC-to-fiat conversions as well, allowing for calculations across dozens of currencies such as the Yemeni rial and the Bangladeshi taka.  The move comes hot on the heels of the Yahoo! Finance bitcoin price listing. In addition, Bloomberg opted to add bitcoin prices to its terminals in late April.  CoinDesk reached out to Google for comment on the decision, but did not receive an immediate response.  Simple design  The layout in Google Finance is simple, allowing for easy navigation without many bells and whistles.  Users can list multiple fiat currencies against the price of bitcoin, and the tool’s news tracker pegs the timing of news releases with the fluctuations in the market.  The tool bears many similarities to Yahoo! Finance’s tool, though it utilizes different layout schemes for graphs and news tickers. However, Yahoo! Finance does not offer bitcoin price conversions to other currencies.  Google strengthens ties with bitcoin  The new tool is perhaps the most direct integration with some aspects of bitcoin on Google's part. In the past, members of Google’s leadership have intimated that, in time, the search giant will come to accept bitcoin in some capacity.  In March, Jared Cohen, Google’s director of ideas, remarked at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, that digital currencies are ""inevitable"". At the same time, he speculated if bitcoin itself would prove to be the top digital currency or the blueprint for many to come.  On the technology side, bitcoin may find a place within Google’s sphere of influence via Google Glass.  Last month, a startup called Eaze announced Nod to Pay. This app allows wearers of Google Glass to make payments in bitcoin, with wallet support for Blockchain and Coinbase users.

42377368,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OQ7,1402496108,Expresscoin Launches to Become Coinbase for the Unbanked,"Santa Monica-based bitcoin and dogecoin exchange expresscoin has officially launched after months of under-the-radar testing.  The formal launch marks the final rebranding of Cash Into Coins as expresscoin, a move that co-founder and CEO Will Wheeler indicates signals a change in how the company will approach its services and the broader bitcoin market.  Wheeler told CoinDesk that while Cash Into Coins was able to become a successful, niche complement to popular cash-to-bitcoin service BitInstant, expresscoin seeks to leverage additional payment options favored by the under- and unbanked including money orders, personal checks and wire transfers.  Comparing his company to fellow California-based bitcoin startup Coinbase, co-founder and chief marketing officer Joseph Hsieh told CoinDesk that users can expect expresscoin to take a different path toward furthering bitcoin adoption, stating:  ""Our position is different. Bitcoin is intrinsically a global currency, so our aspirations are to expand abroad, and the segment of users were targeting are really underbanked or unbanked.""  Hsieh explained that though Coinbase offers a powerful service to those who can link their bank accounts to the company, the expresscoin approach may better serve those who may benefit from bitcoin the most — those locked out of traditional financial products.  At present, expresscoin indicates that they now have a team of nine working out of their LA offices, with additional US remote support aimed at bolstering customer service.  The founders consider this emphasis on customer service a crucial investment needed to tap into an undereducated market segment, saying:  ""We want to be the friend to tell you about bitcoin if you don't have one.""  Removing limitations  Wheeler stated that the rebranding will allow the company to formally introduce itself to new consumers, while leveraging its past experience with Cash Into Coins.  Wheeler explained:  ""The move to expresscoin was we wanted to increase our payment options, we wanted to demonstrate that it wasn't just going to be for the cash to bitcoin ecosystem.""  The company estimates that it facilitated $15m in transactions during the first year of operation as Cash Into Coins, and that it had 20,000 customers during this time.  Wheeler said that the rebranding was put in motion in December. This included the decision to bring on Hsieh, who formerly sold his in-game payments provider Sometrics to America Express for $30m in 2011.  Exploring the market  Still, expresscoin sees its introduction to the market as just the start of what will become a more diverse array of offered services.  The co-founders indicated that they have been working closely with major bitcoin ATM manufacturers, as these companies have been among the more active at positioning their offering to underbanked consumers. Further, they view this market more as collaborators to whom they can provide liquidity rather than competitors.  Expresscoin now operates at least one notable bitcoin ATM, the Robocoin unit that became the first in-casino offering in The D Las Vegas Casino Hotel.  Hsieh added: ""Our mission statement if we were to have it on the wall would be to be wherever fiat and digital currency touch.""  Wallet not included  Speaking to CoinDesk, Hsieh indicated that another differentiator between expresscoin and the competition is that it will not provide its own wallet to its users, though he says the company has not ruled out the possibility of striking a partnership with a large provider.  For now, expresscoin users can bring any wallet to the site, an advantage that they say will enable consumers to test the more advanced mutli-sig and HD offerings now on the market.  Hsieh explained:  ""It's like when you buy from Amazon, you can choose to ship to different destinations. We encourage people to try as many [wallets] as possible.""  The co-founders also say that they will refrain from any merchant offerings, choosing to focus solely on bitcoin's growing consumer market.  Buying process  Basic expresscoin users need only verify their email and mobile number before completing a purchase.  With this basic authorization complete, customers can purchase up to $1,000 in bitcoin or dogecoin per order, with a monthly limit of $1,500.  The co-founders hinted that additional currencies would soon be added to the exchange, but did not indicate a timeline for this service extension or which digital currencies may be included.  Verified users who then submit orders can select their payment method before receiving detailed instructions on how to complete the sale.  To remove the restrictions, customers can opt to upload a photo ID to the exchange. Should any problems persist, the company says users will be directed to its customer service team.

42377359,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ODX,1402493823,Expedia Will Accept Bitcoin for Hotel Bookings,"UPDATE (11th June 16:05 BST): This article has been updated with comment from an Expedia spokesperson.      Travel bookings giant Expedia will start accepting bitcoin for hotel reservations, becoming the first major travel company to accept payments in cryptocurrency.  ""Bitcoin is a great example of how Expedia is investing early in an array of payment options to give our customers and partners more choice in the ways they interact with us,” the company said in a press release announcing the move.  Expedia said bitcoin will be integrated into the payment options for customers at check-out, sitting alongside payment methods like PayPal and Visa.  ""Customers simply indicate bitcoin as their method of payment and then follow a few steps to safely and securely complete each transaction,"" the company said.  Expedia Inc., which has a current market cap totalling $9.75bn, will also consider expanding its bitcoin policy to other travel sectors in its portfolio. Besides hotels, Expedia provides a booking platform for airline and cruise tickets, as well as rental cars and leisure activities. It reported revenues of $1.2bn in the last quarter.  The company's entry to the bitcoin economy could have a significant impact due to the size of its business. Consumers booked 146 million room nights through Expedia last year, for example. Expedia competes with firms like Priceline in the online booking space.  According to the Wall Street Journal, Expedia will adopt bitcoin acceptance in other areas depending on the market response to hotel bookings for bitcoin. The company will be processing transactions through Coinbase, but won't hold any of the bitcoin it receives – rather cash out a daily settlement of US dollars.  The San Francisco company currently handles transactions for over 32,000 businesses worldwide.  Expedia joins other major retailers and service providers in the US who have started accepting bitcoin. This group is led by electronics retailer Overstock.com, which reported more than $1.6m in bitcoin sales for the year in May.  At the end of May, pay TV provider DISH Network became the largest company by market cap to accept bitcoin. The firm, which is valued at $27bn and has 14 million subscribers, will begin accepting the cryptocurrency in the third quarter of the year.

42395332,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLgO,1402487441,Bitcoin Goes Mainstream With Inclusion on Yahoo! Finance,"UPDATE (11th June 02:30 BST): This article has been updated with Yahoo's comment.  Access to bitcoin price data in the world of mainstream finance has taken another big step in the last 24 hours.  Following Bloomberg's recent addition of bitcoin to its trading terminals in late April, and its inclusion on computational knowledge engine WolframAlpha, Yahoo! Finance has followed suit and now displays the BTC/USD price along with its many other listed fiat currencies.  A Yahoo spokesperson told CoinDesk that move was driven by the site's users, many of whom had requested the addition of the feature:  ""We’ve added bitcoin to Yahoo Finance because it’s something our users are interested in – adoption of bitcoin is becoming more commonplace, and we feel it is relevant to our industry and to our users.""  Along with the latest price, Yahoo! also lists opening/closing prices and ranges, plus an index of bitcoin-related news items.  The addition of bitcoin to the site is significant as it will make up-to-date price data available to a potentially new and sizeable audience. According to data for May 2012, Yahoo! Finance was the top financial news and research website in the US with more than 37.5 million unique visitors per month.  Community reaction  Reaction from the community has been positive, with reddit commenters hailing the move as another step in bitcoin's march to global acceptance.  ""This is literally the best news I've had all day, and the day is still young!"" said one commenter. ""Another nice stamp of approval,"" said another.  Other commenters have wondered what source Yahoo! Finance is using for its data, with popular exchange Bitstamp mentioned as a possibility.  Indeed the prices seem to match quite closely, both sitting slightly below the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, but this fact remains to be confirmed.  A further factor noted by redditors is that, since Apple relies on Yahoo! Finance data, it's 'Stocks' apps for both iOS and OS X can also be set to display the bitcoin price, though historical data is not extensive and an error arises with requests older than one week.  The presence of bitcoin on one of the most mainstream finance pages on the web is surely a milestone for the currency. Perhaps only bitcoin's inclusion on Google could be more impactful.  So far, however, that is something the search giant remains reluctant to do.

How about placing an anonymous bitcoin wager on World Cup results?  One unique betting platform for the World Cup is Bitkup. The platform relies on a public wallet for its prize money pool, which it calls the Bitpot. As a result, anyone can observe the transactions as the pot accumulates prize money.  Bitkup's organisers are Brazilian Gustavo Araujo and Oriol Franquesa of Spain, who say they are independent developers who want to raise mainstream awareness of bitcoin using the World Cup as a backdrop.  ""We created Bitkup [...] for people that just want to have fun and try their luck with predictions for the World Cup,"" Araujo said.  Bitkup mechanics  Bitkup players place their bets on the outcome of World Cup matches and receive points in return. The players who accumulate the most points win various prizes.  Bitkup players are ranked in two 'leagues'. There's a Pro League, which costs 0.05 BTC to enter. Once in, players can bet on an unlimited number of matches.  The top-scoring Pro League player will win half of the accumulated pot, which currently stands at 2.14 BTC, while the first runner-up gets 15% of the pot, the next best player gets 13% and so on until the top 20 players are rewarded. Bitkup takes 0.01 BTC from the initial entry fee.  Bitkup isn't all about gambling for cryptocurrency, however. Players can also take part in the Free League, which lets folks place a bet gratis. The 20 highest-scoring Free League players also get prizes, although Bitkup isn't saying what they are yet. The cup's organisers assure players that the prizes will involve ""cryptocurrency and football"".  Ultimately, Pro League players still have to trust Bitkup to transfer the winnings from the pot. When asked about this, the organisers point to their terms and conditions and transparency policy, saying:  ""We are definitely not a fraud, let alone a fake, we have spent much time working on this, our goal being to create something different for the World Cup.""  Cloudbet  What if you could bet on the World Cup for free and still win some bitcoin? What about a 100 BTC prize pot? That's what Cloudbet is offering with its World Cup promotion, which is free to enter.  Winning the 100 BTC won't be easy, though, with the odds being distinctly unfavourable. The Cloudbet promotion requires the winner to select the winner and runner-up of each group, as well as the winners of all subsequent rounds of the competition.  As a refresher, World Cup 2014 has eight groups, with four teams each and five rounds after the group stages (including the match for third place). As Dennis Laudrup, Cloudbet's marketing manager notes:  ""We realise people will need a bit of luck to pick all 31 results correctly, but we're confident that 100 bitcoins is enough motivation for folks to give it their best shot.""  Cloudbet's contest closes on 12th June at 12pm (GMT).  Nitrogen Sports  Another bitcoin betting platform running a World Cup promo is Nitrogen Sports, which is offering 20 BTC to players who complete a series of challenges.  Players must use social media to share winning betslips of World Cup matches in various configurations. Those with the most valid social media shares get the 20-coin pot. Final bets for this contest must be placed before the start of the World Cup final on 13th July.  BetVIP  Then there's BetVIP, which is taking wagers on match results, as well as predictions for the winner and the top scorer. This is an all-purpose betting platform that offers bets across a number of other major tournaments and sports as well, ranging from NBA basketball to NFL football.  Peer-to-peer betting  If trusting centralised betting platforms sets the alarm bells ringing, then why not try a decentralised, peer-to-peer option?  To do so, you need a Counterwallet, which is an account, of sorts, used to settle transactions on Counterparty, a peer-to-peer marketplace. Then, with Counterwallet in hand, go to Xbet.io to browse available bets.  The World Cup features prominently, but bets on the NBA finals and various football leagues are also available.  Grab the address line of the bet you want to make and punch it into your Counterwallet where you'll be able to make the bet. Unusually, you'll be betting against another user, not the house, so funds are held in escrow until the bet is over.  Other bitcoin businesses  If you don't need to enhance the excitement of a World Cup match with wager-induced adrenaline, there are other ways to conjoin your interests in football and cryptocurrency.  At Bspend, for example, you can order a variety of national football jerseys and pay with bitcoin. However, fans should note, these aren't the official World Cup jerseys the teams will be sporting on the pitches of Brazil.  If you're lucky enough to be part of the World Cup carnival at one of the host cities, Sao Paulo, then be sure to hit up Mercado Bitcoin's new ATM, which has been installed in a bar in the financial district. It's a one-way Lamassu unit, however, meaning you can only use it to increase your bitcoin holdings.

42377364,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70OIZ,1402465321,Middle East's First Two-Way Bitcoin ATM Launches in Tel Aviv,"The Middle East region now has its first two-way capable bitcoin ATM after Wednesday evening's launch of a new Robocoin machine, or 'branch', at a fashionable Tel Aviv Hotel.  This gives Israel residents and visitors a new option to enter the bitcoin economy, rather than going through one of the online exchanges, which meant bank transfers, or buying face to face.  ATMs and bitcoin vending machines are also aimed at exchanging smaller amounts of fiat currency, which means they're more appropriate and user-friendly for newcomers.  The ATM's owner is Bitbox, headed by CEO Nimrod Gruber, who said:  “The launch of the first bitcoin ATM in the Middle East will allow any person with no previous knowledge of bitcoin and how it works to easily buy and sell bitcoin 24/7, bypassing the bureaucracy of the banks.""  It also gives tourists a new way to obtain local currency and foreign workers in Israel a new and simpler option to take locally earned shekels and send them to families back home – provided there is another 'cash-out' bitcoin ATM at the other end.  First?  Gruber's claim that this is actually the first 'bitcoin ATM' in the Middle East is open to debate, however. Dubai company Umbrellab demonstrated integration of a bitcoin-buying service in one of the city's ManGo payment kiosks back in April and the Bitcoin Embassy hosts a one-way Lamassu machine.  Umbrellab says it has plans to introduce bitcoin buying to 300-400 ManGo kiosks eventually. At this stage the kiosks allow only for purchase of bitcoins, not sale.  Israel as bitcoin hub  Israel, arguably the world's most significant technology startup hub outside of Silicon Valley, has displayed a generally friendly attitude to bitcoin so far and is home to several venture capitalists, well-known cryptocurrency projects such as Mastercoin, and bitcoin evangelists like Meni Rosenfeld.  The Inside Bitcoins Tel Aviv conference will also take place on 28-29 July at the Hilton Tel Aviv, featuring various luminaries from all sectors of the bitcoin economy.  Michael Eisenberg, partner at early-stage VC firm Aleph, wrote earlier this year that the country should leverage its talent, and capitalize on entrepreneurial dissatisfaction with the US's regulatory mire, to become a bitcoin center.  The new ATM will launch at the Townhouse Tel Aviv hotel in the evening of Wednesday, 11th June.
