42404681,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkDrz,1591999528,Asset Manager Wilshire Phoenix Files to Launch New Bitcoin Investment Trust,"Wilshire Phoenix, an asset manager which tried to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) last year, has filed to launch a new Bitcoin Commodity Trust.      According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing published Friday, the New York-based Wilshire Phoenix intends to offer bitcoin to certain investors through the new trust. While the filing suggests a maximum of 80,000 shares could be offered, a spokesperson said the total number of shares is yet to be determined and the figure only represents a number aimed to help calculate fees.      ""The Shares will provide investors with exposure to bitcoin in a manner that is accessible and cost-efficient without the uncertain and often complex requirements relating to acquiring or holding bitcoin,"" the filing said.      The trust may be looking to compete with Grayscale Investments' $3.6 billion bitcoin trust, which the company launched in 2013. Grayscale (a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent firm) filed to turn its bitcoin trust into an SEC reporting company last year (the move was approved earlier this year).      According to the Wilshire Phoenix filing, Fidelity Digital Asset Services will serve as the trust's bitcoin custodian, while UMB Bank will serve as the cash custodian.      While the cash holdings will have FDIC insurance, the bitcoin held will only be insured against theft in excess of $100 million, according to the filing.      The trust’s value will be calculated each business day at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time by its administrator, according to the document. The value will be derived by just multiplying bitcoin’s price (based on CME’s bitcoin index) at that time with the number of coins held.

The SEC rejected the proposal earlier this year. The idea behind a crypto ETF is it could make bitcoin more accessible to a broader range of investors who might not be comfortable investing directly in bitcoin.      A spokesperson for Wilshire Phoenix did not immediately return a request for comment.

42404678,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkDsy,1591997310,How an Art Collective Is Using Blockchain to Protest Police Brutality,"A blockchain-centric art project is pushing the boundaries of modern art with a controversial digital display.      The DADA Art Collective, a loosely affiliated group of roughly a dozen visual artists across the globe, teamed up with the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces OpenSea and Mintbase plus the file-storage blockchain Arweave to publish the names and faces of American police officers accused of killing unarmed black people.      The project, No Justice No Peace, was published June 6 in collaboration with crypto veteran Dennison Bertram, founder of the DappHero project.      “The collective got in touch with me,” Bertram said. “Social justice is something that I’ve always been interested in. They’d already minted and created these tokens. … It’s a fascinating demonstration of how to do social protests using blockchain technology.”      The DADA Collective’s Judy Mam said 10 artists contributed to this piece to support Black Lives Matter and police reform, with pictures of 30 officers along with their alleged crimes and case statuses.      The artists leveraged Arweave’s blockchain to create a wallet associated with each person killed, holding tokens that have data for the corresponding officers’ information.      “The private keys of the wallets that control these tokens have been destroyed. No one controls these tokens. These tokens can’t be censored, modified or taken down,” the project’s website says.      “Blockchain is itself a political statement, the ability to organize outside of government control,” Bertam said. “What about decentralizing justice or human rights or other aspects of society that are critical to the ways people live?”      And yet, this project raises tricky questions about the ethics of immutable digital records. In Europe, lawmakers have introduced a ""right to be forgotten"" with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Even in the United States, Mam said the artists behind this project prefer to stay anonymous because some jurisdictions limit access to evidence that might incriminate police officers.      “The police do take action against [outspoken] people,” Mam said. “These [visual pieces] are tokenized but they’re not for sale. … It was about making a statement.”    Black Lives Matter    With simple text beneath black and white photos, the message is clear. There’s scant artistic flourish in this piece.      “We don’t forget. We find out who you are,” Mam said. “Maybe someday some of these men will get a [prison] sentence. … But at least now there’s a record that is there forever, immutably, of these people and their crimes.”      The criminal justice system failed to proceed with formal charges in most of these cases, despite community efforts, according to research from Bowling Green State University. This piece is just one of many activist projects already curating public lists with such information. Howard University student and crypto aficionado Gerald Nash, who was not affiliated with the “No Justice No Peace,” said he thinks the project is interesting.      “People should take into account this isn’t an organization doing unbiased research,” Nash said of the art collective. “As a black person and someone who wants to see justice. ... I see no difference between this and holding up a sign.”      Of course, “censorship resistance” is a relative term. Governments could make it difficult to access affiliated websites and keyword searches, even if the blockchain data remains unaltered. Some experts would also argue a blockchain’s immutability depends on its incentive structure and participants, which likely are not infallible. The Arweave blockchain’s distribution is still nascent, with less than 3,000 members in the project’s Discord group.      Even with these limitations, University of New Hampshire law professor Tonya Evans agreed this art project is an interesting use case – memorializing information.      “I would compare it to what news reporters do … [but] reporters have to be very thoughtful about ways to correct the record, even if that’s to add to and not take away from,” Evans said, describing American freedom of speech laws. “Code is also speech. It will be interesting to see what type of innovation emerges during this period with regards to protecting free speech.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | RESEARCH | AR,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/12/how-an-art-collective-is-using-blockchain-to-protest-police-brutality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b31f048fdba35554a246206cd582b36771db53b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,412 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 2% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Friday (8:00 p.m. Thursday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,474 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. The price began to decline, dipping to as low as $9,301, before picking up a bit. The price is well below the 50-day and 10-day moving averages, a bearish technical indicator.      “The fight for the support pivot $9,750 eventually lost. The bears broke through the level and made a major drain,” said Konstantin Kogan, a partner at cryptocurrency fund of funds BitBull Capital. “There is a chance for another decline to $9,000”      Read More: Why Bitcoin Suddenly Dropped 6% on Thursday      However, despite the dip Thursday, Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for digital asset brokerage Koine, sees reason for optimism in the crypto markets.      “Technically this is an important inflection point for bitcoin and I still believe we're headed higher after several days of consolidation, having shaken out the weak longs,” Douglas said, referring to traders who dabbled in the crypto derivatives market this week.

Crypto is acting like a risk-on asset,” said George Clayton, managing partner of Cryptanalysis Capital. “But all of this bitcoin volatility is still within the trend channel,” i.e., par for the course in crypto.      Cryptocurrency stakeholders often scratch their heads watching the stock market. The recent fall in the S&P 500 to where it started the year may seem unhinged to them when bitcoin is up 30% this year, according to MarketWatch data.      “The bullish technical picture for crypto is still intact. So is the macro picture. I cannot say the same for stocks and that confounding rally to the 2020 highs,” said Cryptanalysis’ Clayton.

42404675,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkDp2,1591989908,"Digital Dollar? Get Real, Financial Inclusion Advocates Tell Congress","Currently just a flashy idea, the digital dollar is competing with more prosaic but proven 20th-century methods for the job of getting stimulus funds to every U.S. resident.      That’s the takeaway from Thursday’s House Financial Services Committee (FSC) hearing, where witnesses advocated different solutions to the problem.      Making the case for an electronic greenback was J. Christopher Giancarlo, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), now a director with the Digital Dollar Project.      As he has in the past, he argued tokenization is a way to future-proof the dollar. Other countries, including China, are working to digitize their currencies, he noted. If the U.S. wants to maintain its leadership role in the global financial system, it too should take on this task, he told lawmakers.      While Giancarlo previously cautioned a digital dollar should not be “cobbled together” during a crisis, he suggested at the hearing that laying the groundwork should be part of the response to the downturn caused by COVID-19.      “Nothing reveals the limits of our accounts-based financial system more strongly than the current COVID-19 pandemic, when tens of millions of Americans are waiting a month or more to receive payments by paperchecks,” he said.      “We need to start exploring the next level of technology side by side with the existing accounts-based technology, if for nothing else to build greater redundancies in the system but also greater optionality and more tools in our toolbox to use in crises like this,” he added.      But other witnesses kept the focus on the urgency of making stimulus payments quickly to those in need. One round of paper checks has gone out to individuals who filed taxes in the last two years, but many are still waiting for their stimulus dollars.      “The point I just wanted to drive home [is] we are still in the midst of a crisis and [as] others on the panel said really eloquently, people are suffering today,” said Jodie Kelley, CEO of the Electronic Transactions Association.      “So I wanted to make sure that we recognize the only way to do that is with the tools that we have now,” she said.    Simpler alternatives    The success of prepaid debit cards and peer-to-peer applications like PayPal and Venmo show they can be used to quickly distribute stimulus dollars to those in need, argued Kelley, whose member companies process more than $8.5 trillion in payments annually.      “The prepaid debit cards in particular are a preferred way to make payments to lower-income people. They are simple to use and don’t require a mobile phone,” she told CoinDesk after the hearing.      As for using blockchain, Mehrsa Baradaran, a Professor of Law at the University of California Irvine School of Law, said the discussion of that technology is premature.      “How do we get people to meet people where they’re at and make sure our solutions match the problem?” she asked lawmakers. “The problem here is the banking deserts, it’s the unbanked and underbanked, and we have technology to meet those people and I think that’s critical at this juncture.”      Read more: US Senator: ‘I Don’t Think You’ve Persuaded Anyone’ Crypto Creates Financial Inclusion      Baradaran advocated a different, more feasible strategy (at least technologically, if not politically): using the U.S. Postal Service to create local bank branches in partnership with the Federal Reserve.      “We need to close this cash-digital divide first,” Baradaran said.      Non-tokenized digital dollars could also be easily set up, said Morgan Ricks, a Professor of Law at Vanderbilt University School of Law. Ricks has long touted the concept of a FedAccount, a bank account essentially offered by the Federal Reserve for consumers to have direct access.      Setting up FedAccounts should be fairly straightforward and easy to accomplish, he told lawmakers: The Fed already offers these services to banks, large financial institutions and government entities.      “The Fed itself has been processing real-time instant payments for many many decades through the FedWire system,"" he said. ""The Fed has been opening accounts on its own books since its inception ... retail operations are a different matter.”      The Fed could even contract out certain tasks until it has built up its own internal infrastructure, he said.    ‘Starting a journey’    A large portion of the hearing focused on the tokenized dollar concept, with Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) asking Giancarlo to walk him through how it might aid financial inclusion and subsidy distribution.      In the former regulator’s view, a tokenized dollar could be a way to provide banking services to those who lack them. Here, broadband access is the largest issue that would need to be addressed, he said.      A lack of banking access is “not insurmountable,” if residents of areas underserved by financial institutions have broadband access, Giancarlo said.      The digital dollar “is about on-ramps into the financial system, and making them as simple and accessible as possible,” he said. While he acknowledged that access to mobile devices might be another barrier, he said solving this would make the question of financial inclusion much easier.      Focusing on providing mobile access and a tokenized dollar rather than an expansion of existing banking services, might attract more individuals to the new system, he said.      “There are populations...with folks that are just outside the banking system but are comfortable with bearer instruments,” he said.      Prior to the hearing, Digital Dollar Project director and Accenture manager David Treat told CoinDesk he was encouraged the conversation was happening at all.      He said he expected some stakeholders might only be comfortable with incremental changes to the financial system right now.      “I think we're at an inflection point now where we're starting on a journey of modernizing money for our digital world and I think we will all benefit if we collectively recognize that [the] journey will have multiple waves of innovation,” Treat said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Nikhilesh De, Sandali Handagama",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/12/digital-dollar-get-real-financial-inclusion-advocates-tell-congress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38cfaa38c3da2d29cdb2672479548623953fd57c-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404684,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkDxt,1591984874,Blockchain Bites: Designing Digital Dollars and Following the Quadriga Trail,"Top shelf    Digital Dollars On Thursday the House Financial Services Committee (FSC) Task Force on Financial Technology convened on Capitol Hill to discuss the possible role of a digital dollar is distributing COVID-19 relief payments. The watchdogs discussed FedAccounts, or cryptographic wallets held by the Federal Reserve, for commercial banking services.      The National Science Foundation, an independent branch of the federal government, has given blockchain startup KRNC $225,000 to design cryptocurrency features for the U.S. dollar. The startup is pioneering the Proof-of-Balance consensus mechanism to assign voting power and distribute a digital currency to users in proportion to an individual’s existing wealth.      Following the Money The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) issued a report saying QuadrigaCX operated like a Ponzi scheme. The provincial regulator said Gerald Cotten, who died under mysterious circumstances, traded against his customers using their funds under fake accounts set up on other exchanges. This revelation contradicts Quadriga’s claims that customer funds were lost upon his death, as Cotten was the person to maintain copies of the private keys.      Meanwhile, in the last two days three Ethereum transactions have spent $5.7 million on fees. But a report claims it’s not a bug – an exchange is being blackmailed. (Decrypt)      Elsewhere, the owner of a now-defunct Romanian crypto exchange CoinFlux has pleaded guilty to laundering roughly $1.8 million in a fraudulent scheme involving fake eBay ads and a car wash.      Protocol Level Pseudonymous developer Fiatjaf has created Etleneum, what he calls a “centralized” version of Ethereum running on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. Like Ethereum, Etleneum has public “contracts” open for anyone’s use, but protocol is not decentralized. Fiatjaf controls it all – as he is quick to note – as a commentary on the ways Ethereum tries and fails to cede technocratic and social power from a cadre of developers.      Researchers from Imperial College London and University College London found the overwhelming number of transactions on the EOS, Tezos and XRP Ledger networks either have no value attached or are passing it back and forth within one entity.      Security in technology Mutual fund giant Vanguard has completed the first phase of a blockchain pilot to issue digital asset-backed securities (ABS). Together with blockchain startup Symbiont, an unnamed U.S. ABS issuer, BNY Mellon, Citi and State Street, Vanguard modeled the full lifecycle of an ABS settlement on blockchain.      Additionally, in separate statements, Algorand and Tezos Foundations said the blockchain networks are trying to stay on the right side of the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “Travel Rule,” by linking up with analytics companies Chainalysis and Coinfirm, respectively, to help bake regulatory compliance into their eponymous blockchains.      Expansions? Crypto wallet and bitcoin custodian, Xapo is discontinuing support for credit card payments for digital asset purchases, ahead of its transition into a digital bank later this year. As of yesterday, users would not be able to add funds to their account through credit cards.      Gemini is planning to expand its services to Singapore with the appointment of former Goldman Sachs executive Jeremy Ng as its new Managing Director of Asia-Pacific. Crypto derivatives platform Seed CX will be axing its exchange arm to focus solely on its Zero Hash product, a custody and settlement service that accounts for 95% of the firm’s revenue.    Markets    On Thursday, bitcoin tumbled 6.37% to about $9,100 in tandem with a 5.7% sell-off on the Standard & Poor’s 500 – rekindling an ongoing debate over the cryptocurrency’s use as a store of value. The slide in stocks came a day after the Federal Reserve provided an unexpectedly dour assessment of the outlook for the U.S. economy, and investors speculated that a possible uptick in new cases might slow the pace of the recovery. Some investors may have also sold bitcoin, still seen as a risky asset despite its 30% gain year-to-date. Since March, bitcoin’s price has shown a weak but consistent correlation with both gold and stock prices, and is now trading well below its price average for the past 50 and 100 days, typically a bearish signal.      Coinbase announced Wednesday it may list Bancor’s BNT token as well as 18 others, which gave the asset’s global trading price a slight bump. The token project itself saw a resurgence in May, facilitating nearly $10 million worth of trading volume and rising from roughly $0.20 a token at the start of the month to $0.85 by the end. Bancor’s growth, despite the broader economic crisis in 2020, may be due to a systems upgrade in April as well as the team’s role in forging a data strategy for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s campaign. Still, BNT tokens are now selling for far less than they were during the initial sale in 2017.

In a last-ditch attempt to avoid incarceration, Le Roux wrote a letter to District Judge Ronnie Abrams, of the Southern District of New York (SDNY), this week detailing his personal history and addressing his alleged crimes. He was indicted on drug charges in 2012, pleaded guilty two years later and has been sitting in detention since. On Friday, he was reportedly sentenced to 25 years in prison, though he can appeal this decision.      Even if Le Roux wins an appeal, he would still face extradition to the Philippines, where he is wanted on a murder charge dating back to 2010. Should he be released by courts in both the U.S. and Philippines, however, he has planned his next step.      ""I plan to start a business selling and hosting Bitcoin miners,"" he wrote in the letter to the judge filed June 11.      The letter provides some background on what bitcoin is and how it works, including how coins are mined through the use of ASICs, powerful chips designed for the task. Le Roux claimed he acquired related expertise working for the U.K. signals intelligence agency known as Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).      ""I have a custom design for an ASIC chip that utilizes special optimizations in the underlying computer code or algorithm known as ('SHA'), I obtained this knowledge about the mathematical properties of SHA while working as a contract programmer at GCHQ in London in the early 2000's,"" Le Roux wrote.      ""These optimizations have allowed me to create an ASIC chip design, and therefore ASIC miners, that are an order of magnitude faster at Bitcoin mining than any current design,"" he wrote. ""To this end I plan to put my knowledge and skills to a better, and legal use.""      The Bitcoin white paper was released in 2008 and the first coins were mined the following year. ASICs emerged a few years after.    Satoshi claims    Over recent years, speculation has abounded alleging that Le Roux might be, or have ties to, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.      Last year, journalist Evan Ratliff published an article exploring this connection, based on a court filing by Ira Kleiman against self-proclaimed Satoshi Craig Wright.      ""Paul Le Roux had the technical skills to create bitcoin – that much I’d concluded the first time around,"" Ratliff wrote.      Ratliff stops short of declaring outright that Le Roux is Satoshi, and notes there are many other programmers who fit the bill.      Le Roux does not appear to have claimed he is Satoshi, either.      He was sentenced to 25 years in an SDNY hearing Friday, according to Matthew Russell Lee of Inner City Press, who frequently posts updates from the courthouse.      Before the conviction was handed down, a prosecutor said Le Roux's plan to enter bitcoin mining ""gives pause,"" though such a business ""could be operated legally.""

In the future, the bank may connect with Hex Trust through a SWIFT integration or allow the trust company to build application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect directly to the bank’s core.      Read more: Liechtenstein Bank Opens Up Cryptocurrency Investment for Clients      Buechel came to the bank last July from a multi-year stint at Bank Frick, a Liechtenstein-based family bank that became one of the first banks in the world to allow clients to directly invest in cryptocurrencies. Mason Privatbank Liechtenstein is aiming to cater to both crypto-focused investors and asset managers who are looking to diversify their portfolios, Buechel added.      Hex Trust will also connect the bank’s clients to third-party providers who can provide crypto lending, staking, borrowing and trading. With the bank’s parent company, Mason Financial Holdings, based in Hong Kong, this will be the first bank that has an Asian presence that Hex Trust is working with, said Hex Trust CEO Alessio Quaglini.      “Our goal is to create interconnectivity between the traditional asset world and the digital asset ecosystem,” Quaglini said.

42383958,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zSnh,1591978928,"Money Reimagined: The Fed, Hertz, a Bonkers Stock Market and why ICOs Still Matter","Fear not, Wall Street.      While this week’s sell-off in stocks was steep, the S&P 500 is still up 34% from its March 23 nadir on Friday morning. In other words, the United States’ fiscal and monetary COVID-19 stimulus efforts continue to be heavily favoring hedge fund managers, bankers and corporate CEOs. Meanwhile, as stocks have posted a record-breaking rally, 115,000 Americans have died from a pandemic that forced 38 million others to file for unemployment benefits.      This is not only fundamentally unfair, it also highlights how our current capital market system grossly misallocates resources. Failed companies with dire long-term prospects – see Hertz, below – get rescued while small businesses and startups working on solutions to our economic and public health malaise miss out.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      It’s time to talk about an alternative mechanism for allocating capital, one that’s not skewed by the stock market. It’s time to revisit ICOs.    A different approach    First, some level-setting: The 2016-2017 ICO boom was an abomination. Rife with scams, ill-defined business plans and hype, the initial coin offering bubble provided a reminder of why securities regulations exist: to make fundraisers with asymmetric information accountable and to protect investors from their abuse.      But the token boom did unleash some valuable outside-the-box thinking. We should tap into it now.      ICOs were touted as a means for innovators to gain access to a wider funding pool and for retail investors to earn the kind of returns otherwise reserved for privileged insiders. Startups, it was said, could now bypass the venture capital gatekeepers who decide who gets funded and who gets the golden handout of a stock market initial public offering, while token investors could make those 100x payouts VCs boasted about.      Disintermediating both Silicon Valley and Wall Street paved the way to an open market for ideas, ICO fans proclaimed. Yes, there’d be losses, blowups and scams. But in its roundabout way it would ultimately allocate resources to where the economy most needed it: to the innovators.      Those voices were quieted by the bubble’s bursting in 2018. But the current state of U.S. financial markets demands we revisit some of their arguments – if not to resurrect the failed ICO model than to think through related regulatory reforms that address the problems with the Wall Street model.      After all, the transfer of wealth from ordinary Americans outside the system to a privileged few insiders has been many magnitudes greater these past two months than anything that happened in the token issuance markets.      For most of the 20th century, that system served reasonably as an engine for monetizing American ingenuity and funding economic development. But, over time, mostly because of the excessive political clout that Wall Street accumulated, it has incorporated some perverse incentives that discourage innovation.      Part of the problem stems from our political culture. The mainstream narrative fed by media outlets like CNBC and by Dow industrials-obsessed political leaders like Donald Trump positions the stock market as the bellwether of the American Dream. With elites so invested in the market, both economically and politically, it’s little wonder the COVID-19 monetary and fiscal bailouts were geared toward propping it up.      But it’s also structural.      Think of how the quarterly “earnings season” sets standards. The rewards for all involved – Wall Street’s earnings forecasters, ROI-obsessed fund managers and corporate executives and, by extension, the bonuses of their middle management staff – hinge on “beating the number” every three months.      This isn’t conducive to taking bold bets on innovative strategies that take much longer to gestate. Consider the problem of “stranded assets.” Most pension funds continue to hold big stakes in carbon-heavy companies such as oil and gas producers even though reams of analysis suggest they will be worthless within the longer-term retirement horizon of most of their members. It’s hard to get off the drug of quarterly returns.      (A tangential thought experiment: Quarterly company reports are a byproduct of centralized, siloed accounting systems in which bookkeepers and auditors must reconcile records and draft periodic financial snapshots. What would happen to the quarterly rhythms of Wall Street if these reports became obsolete? What if all counterparties within a particular supply chain or economic ecosystem instead contributed to a single distributed ledger with an openly available yet privacy-protected snapshot of all transactions in real time? Such models are not possible now, but blockchains and zero-knowledge proof developers are putting them within the realm of imagination.)    What works and what doesn’t?    To imagine an alternative, cast your mind back to 2018 when token prices were tanking, the ICO market was drying up and “Crypto Winter” was setting in. There was actually a sensible debate back then on what token-based fundraising ideas should be retained and which ones should be dispelled.      We should revive it.      For example, are security token offerings, which require regulatory filings but can integrate smart contracts that traditional stocks and bonds cannot, a better way for startups to fund themselves?      STOs were hot for a brief post-ICO period, and then lost momentum as it was clear the regulatory, compliance and technical framework had a long way to go. But there seems to be some resurgent interest, with issuer platforms Polymath and Securitize both making technical progress. One can imagine the recent tie-up between Galaxy and Bakkt also veering into security token services for institutional investors.      Can we also agree on what legal utility tokens are, and on what the best practices for marketing them are? If, as the “Hinman doctrine” suggests, a token can cease to be security if its network evolves to a more decentralized state, what is the right framework for token issuers to stay compliant through that evolution toward utility status? How can they stay compliant at the outset but have a means to attain the desired network effects of a token-governed decentralized system?      And how do we make it easier for small investors to legally and safely buy and sell tokens?      Accredited investor rules are outdated, favor the same set of privileged wealthy players and unreasonably restrict the general public’s access. Meanwhile, U.S. restrictions on a host of crypto exchanges deny ordinary Americans access to a market that’s intrinsically designed for little guys to participate in.      Regulation is both unavoidable and necessary. But it absolutely should not function as protective armor for a capital market system that harms our economy’s capacity to optimize capital allocation.      At a time when the U.S. economy needs innovative approaches to everything, we urgently need an innovative approach to how we fund innovation.    A phoenix rises… and falls    For proof of our broken capital allocation system, look no further than the performance of Hertz’s stock. On May 24, the car rental company filed for bankruptcy after incurring massive losses on account of the COVID-19 travel restrictions, which had left the industry’s fleets at a standstill. In response, Hertz’s share price, which had already shed more than 85% from a two-year high in late February, plunged further, dropping into penny stock territory to $0.56. But then a strange thing happened: On Thursday last week, Hertz started a three-day tear to hit $5.54 on Monday, a 574% gain. A surge in trading activity by accounts listed on small investor trading app Robinhood seemed to be behind the gain. As the rest of the market absorbed the euphoria of a stimulus-fueled recovery, the bankrupt car rental firm was suddenly attracting an influx of speculative retail investors.      For many of those newcomers, the story hasn’t ended well. On Wednesday, the New York Stock Exchange put the company on notice for delisting. Hertz is appealing that decision, but the announcement sent the shares crashing back to earth. At Thursday’s close, the price was at $2.06.      A common caveat emptor response would simply say that some greedy speculators learned a lesson and we can forget about it. But the reality is more nuanced. That kind of speculative mania is inseparable from the broader sentiment of the market, which is now consumed by a “don’t fight the Fed” logic on monetary stimulus. Hertz’s mini-bubble was (indirectly) engineered by central bankers.    The global town hall    What's your story, bitcoin? June has been a frustrating month so far for bitcoin bulls. That’s not only because a series of rallies offered false hope, each faltering near the psychologically important $10,000 level. It’s also because market performance has again confounded efforts to define a narrative for bitcoin as an asset. After its COVID-19 sell-off in early March, which challenged the idea of bitcoin as a safe haven, bitcoin’s relatively strong rebound was explained in terms of fiat money supply issues. Bitcoin would then be described as an antidote to the fiat world’s “quantitative easing” as the Federal Reserve’s stimulus efforts spawned the “Money Printer go Brrrrr” meme and bitcoin’s own monetary policy “quantitatively tightened” via the halving. But on Thursday, one day after the Fed said it was “committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy,” bitcoin again sold off sharply. After staging another frustrating rally to just above $9,900, it plunged to an intraday low of $9108.47. Crucially, this was in sync with a big unwinding in U.S. stocks as concerns grew around new COVID-19 cases.      So, is bitcoin just a “risk asset,” moving up and down with overall investor risk appetites? It’s unclear. Having a more consistent story would make it easier to make an investment case for bitcoin. But maybe the lesson is we shouldn’t be searching for a narrative. Don’t try to pigeon-hole it. Bitcoin just is.      We laid the table for you... The failure of a meaningful price breakout is proof enough that the long-awaited arrival of institutional investors into crypto markets remains unfulfilled – regardless of Paul Tudor Jones’ or Bloomberg’s upbeat comments about bitcoin. But this hasn’t stopped big players in the crypto industry from continuing to build services catering to institutions for when they finally do show up. Three separate firms – Genesis (a CoinDesk sister company), BitGo and Coinbase – have established crypto prime brokerages, which leverage deep balance sheets and market connections to provide assured liquidity and price-efficient order routing for institutional investors. Meanwhile, Galaxy and Bakkt are teaming up to offer specialized crypto custody and trading services to the same kinds of players. In a press release, the firms described it as a “white-glove service,” the kind of business that lays it all on with a tailored service for its clients. So, there you go, institutions, the price is right, the butlers are waiting for you. What more do you need? Jump in. The water’s fine.      Go for a bike ride, get doxxed. Those of us who obsess about privacy – as Money Reimagined does from time to time – can get frustrated by an apparent lack of concern about it among the general public. That’s why it’s important to humanize it, to show the real-world impact of privacy breaches on people’s lives.  Enter Peter Weinberg. Thanks to a date error in a police public service announcement and some overzealous users of geolocating cycling app Strava, a Twitter mob wrongly flagged Weinberg as the instigator of a rather ugly incident. A viral video had earlier shown a different man on a bicycle accosting two young girls who were posting flyers in support of George Floyd on a trail in Bethesda, Md.. When the Maryland-National Capital Park Police tweeted a request for information about the unhinged cyclist, it wrongly used June 1 as the date of the incident. That tweet was shared 55,000 times. It later corrected the tweet to say June 2. But that one was only shared 2,000 times. You can piece together what happened. A Strava user must have surveyed the site’s data, found what was thought to be a likeness, tied it to Weinberg’s associated social media profiles, put two and two together to come up with five and then outed him. Weinberg’s Twitter and LinkedIn message feeds were barraged with comments accusing him of being a racist and of engaging in child abuse. This is surely not what he signed up for when he agreed to communicate information about his rides and exercise regime with a friendly community of fellow cyclists.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

In 2018 it achieved ‘unicorn’ status after closing a Series E fundraising round that pushed its valuation to nearly $3 billion. Goldman Sachs has also previously invested in the company.  Circle debuted its first consumer products, a bitcoin exchange and wallet, in 2014, but emphasized that the products were intended to facilitate the exchange of fiat money into cryptocurrency and were not geared toward trading and speculation. It introduced a mobile app, which was eventually rebranded as Circle Pay, later that year.  In 2015, Circle became the first company to receive a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which enabled them to serve customers in the state. The following year, Circle became the first digital currency company to receive an electronic money license from the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain, which allowed it to work with British bank Barclays.  In 2016, Circle discontinued its bitcoin exchange and announced that it would focus on its own blockchain protocol, Spark, a smart contract platform which utilizes a combination of technologies, including bitcoin and other blockchains in addition to traditional settlement systems, to carry out payments.  In 2017, Circle revealed that it was developing CENTRE, ethereum-based technology intended to connect various digital payment wallets, such as its own Circle Pay, Venmo and Alipay, using an ERC-20 token called CENT. CENTRE later spun out into a subsidiary, and in December 2017 raised $20 million in a simple agreement for future tokens sale (SAFT).  The company acquired U.S. crypto exchange Poloniex in 2018 for around $400 million, and launched a digital investment and storage app, Circle Invest, the same year in 46 U.S. states. In 2018, Circle also announced and launched its U.S. dollar-backed stable coin, USDC, which was developed in conjunction with its affiliated CENTRE consortium, of which crypto exchange Coinbase is also a part.  In March 2019, Circle completed its acquisition of equity crowdfunding business SeedInvest for an undisclosed amount. The company had announced the acquisition in October 2018.  In June 2019, Circle announced that it would cease the operation of its mobile app, Circle Pay, allowing only withdrawals beyond July 8th.

Founded in 2016 by Jeremy Welch, Casa’s team notably includes bitcoin developer Jameson Lopp and Trezor founder Alena Vranova.  The Casa node is a plug-and-play on-ramp for individuals looking to join the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network, launched in 2018, is a micropayment processing layer built on the Bitcoin blockchain. The network allows participating nodes to create preloaded channels for low-cost, speedy transactions between parties. Once the parties decide they would like to settle final payments, the channel is closed and the state of the channel is recorded to Bitcoin’s ledger.  Casa aims to make it easy to join the Lightning Network with its node, the features of which include receiving transactions, the capability to open private channels and a full copy of the Bitcoin blockchain for validation purposes. In July 2019, Casa released the Sats App, a mobile app allowing users to control their lightning node operations on the go.  Additionally, Casa’s Keymaster product is a custody solution that utilizes a multi-signature technology (commonly referred to as multi-sig) to secure funds. Users can choose to subscribe to various levels of the service, each of which includes different products - for example, a mobile app and hardware wallets - designed for a variety of holdings, from small balances to large.

Blockstack seeks a new infrastructure for the internet where users choose which data to share and whom to share it with. Through their platform design, applications developers can’t access user data, users can choose who stores their data, and permission rights to read or write to the data are decided by the user.  Blockstack was founded by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea in 2016. They developed Blockstack to be an open-source effort serving as a full-stack alternative to traditional cloud computing. This allows for a new applications layer to the traditional internet, providing a new network for decentralized applications, or dapps.  Data processing is run on a client’s computer connected to the network, rather than centralized servers hosted by application providers, this is what allows for decentralized applications. The decentralized storage system, Gaia, enables what they describe as “user-controlled private data lockers.” Users connect their “data lockers” to Blockstack’s client software, and applications write to the lockers directly. The locker acts as your storage for all the information attached to your account, or “universal ID.”  In addition to Gaia, Blockstack’s platform includes the “stacks” blockchain, smart contracts language “clarity,” an authentication protocol and developer tools (SDKs). Additionally, they incorporate the existing internet transport layer and already established communication protocols.  In early 2019, there were more than 100 applications built on Blockstack. In April of 2019, Blockstack notably filed for the SEC’s Regulation A+ crowdfunding exemption, which would allow it to raise capital through the U.S. securities market via a subsidiary, Blockstack Token LLC. Blockstack became the first company approved to raise capital via a token sale through the securities market on July 10th, 2019. Regulation A+ is an alternative to a traditional initial public offering (IPO) with fewer regulatory hurdles for companies trying to go public up to $50 million. It ultimately raised over $23 million in the token sale in September 2019, according to SEC filings.  Tokens in the Blockstack ecosystemhttps://stackstoken.com/, STX, are utility tokens that are consumed as “fuel” when users register digital assets or execute smart contracts. Notable private investments in Blockstack have come from Union Square Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, Blockchain Capital, Digital Currency Group, and Techcrunch founder Michael Arrington.

Gox – the bitcoin exchange at the center of one of the most notorious hacks in crypto – has had his conviction upheld by Japan's high court.      On Thursday, Tokyo's the court threw out an appeal from Mark Karpeles, who had been found guilty last year for manipulating electronic data, upholding the original conviction and sentence of two and a half years in prison, suspended for four years.      Karpeles was originally arrested in August 2015, roughly 18 months after an unknown hacker made off with more than 850,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox. At the time the amount was valued in the hundreds of millions, but would be worth more than $8 billion, today. Around 15% was later recovered and now constitutes the Mt. Gox estate, which is still being fought over by the exchange's creditors.      See also: Mt. Gox Deadline Extended Again After Creditors Criticize Refund Proposal      Prosecutors had originally accused Karpeles of embezzling user funds, breach of trust and manipulating electronic data, and demanded he serve 10 years in prison. The Tokyo District Court found him innocent on the first two counts, but guilty on manipulating electronic data in order to harm his clients.      The legal team representing Karpeles, which has always claimed he is innocent of all charges, contend that prosecutors didn't know how crypto exchanges operated and were merely using him as a fall guy.      “Today’s verdict was unfortunate, and I am reviewing its contents alongside my lawyers and will decide how to proceed from there in the coming days,” Karpeles said following the ruling, in a report from the Associated Press.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/12/japans-high-court-rejects-former-mt-gox-ceos-conviction-appeal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7745ee5b85fc93785f37f12700506ae295fa3d65-1024x657.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383951,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zScN,1591969719,Tezos and Algorand Latest to Integrate Tech for Anti-Money Laundering Compliance,"Two blockchain platforms, both proof-of-stake, are trying to stay on the right side of the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) ""Travel Rule.""      In separate announcements on Thursday, the Algorand and Tezos Foundations said they had linked up with two analytics companies, Chainalysis and Coinfirm, respectively, to help bake regulatory compliance into their eponymous blockchains.      It's been very nearly a year since the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog, updated its guidance for nations to stipulate that crypto companies must store and disclose information about senders and receivers, above a certain transaction threshold.      In Algorand's case, Chainalysis will provide a know-your-transaction (KYT) solution, allowing its foundation to monitor large volumes of on-chain activity for the native ALGO token and report any suspicious transactions to the authorities.      While Algorand emphasizes that the new integration will enhance trust and security, the specter of regulation is never too far away. As it says in a press release, the new integration will enable the foundation to ""fulfill their regulatory obligations to report suspicious activity.""      In a statement, Fangfang Chen, the Algorand Foundation's chief operating officer, said the integration would allow it to meet regulatory requirements in Singapore. “We needed a compliance partner that could not only help us adhere to regulations in Singapore where we are based but also global regulatory best practices,"" she said.      Over the past 12 months, some national regulators have transposed FATF's ""Travel Rule"" into local law. The U.S' Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), one of the first regulators to implement the Travel Rule back in May 2019, has continued with a minimum threshold of $3,000.      Singapore announced in January that parties involved in crypto transactions worth more than 1,500 Singapore dollars (around US$1,100) would have to be ready to disclose identities.      Chainalysis told CoinDesk that while the integration was not a ""comprehensive solution to Travel Rule compliance,"" it would help the Algorand Foundation meet some of the requirements, including picking out transactions that trigger the Travel Rule, as well as identifying relevant senders and receivers.      ""FATF’s guidance states that automated transaction monitoring and customer risk scoring are essential components of an effective anti-money laundering program,"" a spokesperson said in an email. ""Chainalysis provides the transaction monitoring software required to hold a license in Singapore and comply with regulatory requirements in other FATF jurisdictions.""      See also: Algorand and Blockstack Are Building a Multi-Chain Smart Contract Language      Tezos' tie-up with Coinfirm's is broader, allowing its foundation and commercial entities such as exchanges to monitor activity on the protocol. Rather than a partnership, it's more that Coinfirm's AML Platform will be available for Tezos and XTZ transactions.      Generally, though, Tezos' deal with Coinfirm runs along the same lines as Algorand's integration with Chainalysis.      ""One of the largest roadblocks for the growth of blockchain protocols and cryptocurrencies in the global regulated market has been focused on AML compliance regulations,"" reads a press release. ""AML has become a required feature for protocols and related assets who want a leadership position in the market and the capability to operate in regulated markets globally.""      Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinfirm CEO and co-founder Pawel Kuskowski said FATF, and broader AML compliance, were among the main motivations behind Tezos' integration with its AML platform.      ""It will allow entities using XTZ and its ecosystem to become FATF compliant under AML requirements...while paving the way for them to further implement Travel Rule dedicated solutions,"" he said. ""Overall, the greatest inhibiting factor when it comes to the growth of protocols is AML-related regulations.""      For protocols to work in regulated markets, they have to meet set guidelines. ""The Tezos integration [with Coinfirm] allows for XTZ to operate according to AML guidelines in regulated markets including FATF AML guidelines,"" Kuskowski said.      The Tezos Foundation declined to comment for this article.      See also: Tezos Becomes Latest Blockchain to Tap Chainlink for Oracle Services      The Travel Rule was met with trepidation when first unveiled. Many in the industry were concerned it could spell the end for cryptocurrency transactions by eroding user privacy and making the compliance burden on exchanges and other companies too much to bear.      But while there have been some negative effects, such as options exchanges Deribit being pushed out of the Netherlands, in other ways it may be good for the industry: Germany's second-largest exchange, Boerse Stuttgart, said the strong AML rules have made crypto attractive to a growing institutional audience.      And it isn't only Tezos and Algorand that have made themselves FATF compliant. Soon after the Travel Rule guidance was announced, Coinfirm inked a deal with Ripple to tag transactions on the XRP ledger that may have been laundered through mixer services.      Cryptocurrency intelligence provider CipherTrace has also rolled out its own solution, allowing wallet services and exchanges to securely share information about their customers to comply with the Travel Rule.      A year on, and with the Travel Rule now being enacted into local laws, it appears that instead of scurrying away, the crypto industry is simply adapting to the new regulatory landscape.",NEUTRAL,ALGO,ALGO | ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/12/tezos-and-algorand-latest-to-integrate-tech-for-anti-money-laundering-compliance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f9179a262fbacd748774e8ba186cd5083fb55b3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383950,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zSb7,1591966409,Crypto Exchange Owner Admits Laundering $1.8M in Online Auctions Fraud,"The owner of a now-defunct Romanian crypto exchange called CoinFlux has pled guilty to laundering roughly $1.8 million in a fraudulent scheme involving fake eBay ads and a car wash.      Vlad-Calin Nistor and 14 other defendants, including the owner of a car wash, have all entered guilty pleas at the Eastern District Court of Kentucky for their involvement in a racketeering conspiracy and cyber fraud scheme that defrauded millions of dollars from U.S. residents by selling goods that didn't actually exist.      Beginning in 2013, the defendants began posting fake advertisements on sites such as eBay and Craigslist for items such as cars. Often using stolen identities, the group would pretend to be U.S. military personnel who needed to sell their goods before beginning a tour of duty. They even set up a fake call center to assuage any concerns victims had about the advertisements.      After the victim had sent payment, the group would begin the process of transferring the money out of the U.S. and back to Romania. Most of the time, this was done by converting illicit funds into crypto, usually bitcoin, and transferring it to Nistor and his crypto platform CoinFlux, where it would then be exchanged into the local currency.      Per a release from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday, the ringleader was Bogdan-Stefan Popescu, the owner of car wash in Bucharest, Romania's capital. He provided instructions for Nistor and Coinflux for transferring the illicit funds out of bitcoin and into selected bank accounts, which were usually set up under the names of his employees and family members.      “Through the use of digital currencies and trans-border organizational strategies, this criminal syndicate believed they were beyond the reach of law enforcement,” said Michael D’Ambrosio, assistant director at the U.S. Secret Service's Office of Investigations.      See also: France Charges Alleged BTC-e Operator Alexander Vinnik Following Greek Extradition      Back in December 2018, Nistor was arrested on an international warrant on charges of money laundering, fraud, and involvement in organized crime. He, alongside the other defendants, was promptly extradited to the U.S. the following month. At the time of his arrest, Nistor's lawyer argued to Romania's Court of Appeal that he had no way of knowing that the bitcoin in question came from criminal proceeds.      CoinFlux advertised itself as a 24-hour marketplace that provide a local fiat gateway for Romanian traders. The exchange had been preparing to celebrate its third anniversary with zero transaction costs, less than a week before Nistor's arrest.      Five days later, following Nistor's arrest, CoinFlux's Twitter account said they were in ""the unpleasant situation to temporarily stop any digital currency exchanges."" In a follow-up post, CoinFlux's marketing head said an ""unexpected investigation"" meant their banks accounts had been frozen and they had been temporarily locked out of their site.      ""Our expectation is that we will gain control back, within the next days,"" the post said.

Prices for bitcoin fell 6.37% to about $9,100, as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks lost 5.7%.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The slide in stocks came a day after the Federal Reserve provided an unexpectedly dour assessment of the outlook for the U.S. economy, and investors speculated a possible uptick in new cases might slow the pace of the recovery. Some investors may have also sold bitcoin, still seen as a risky asset despite its 30% gain for the year to date.      “I think the general negative sentiment of traditional markets affects bitcoin,"" Sasha Goldberg, senior trader for Efficient Frontier Markets, a digital asset quant fund, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey.      Thursday's plunge in bitcoin prices was nowhere near the 39% wipeout on March 12, when it became clear to investors across all markets just how devastating of a toll the coronavirus was likely to take on the economy.      The day's session kindled chatter anew among cryptocurrency analysts over whether bitcoin is mostly uncorrelated with traditional assets, or whether it should trade as an inflation hedge like gold, or in sync with riskier assets like stocks.      ""The institutionalization of crypto (i.e. same firms that trade stocks and other assets, trading crypto), will lead to higher correlation, especially during extreme risk on/off scenarios such as margin calls,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, a London-based prime brokerage to cryptocurrency investment firms.      Thursday's price decline came just a day after the Fed indicated that joblessness would remain elevated for at least three years. That means Fed officials expect to keep interest rates close to zero through 2022, while pumping at least $120 billion a month of freshly created money into the financial system for the foreseeable future. If bitcoin is an inflation hedge, then loose monetary policy should theoretically be good for the price.      Larry Kudlow, one of President Donald Trump's top economic advisers, told Fox Business Network in an interview Thursday that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet's ""gonna rise by about $10 trillion by year-end."" Just in 2020 alone, the Fed's total assets have climbed by about $3 trillion to $7.2 trillion.      ""You know, I don't know why the market has sold off,"" Kudlow said Thursday.      Earlier in the day, Stack Funds, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds, had written in a weekly report that ""there was a higher probability for bitcoin to swing upside in the coming week."" It went so far as to predict that bitcoin might be on the cusp of a ""potential move upside to $40,000,"" or more than quadruple the current price level.      Instead bitcoin took a nosedive as the mood darkened on Wall Street.      ""Bitcoin, along with the entire emerging digital asset class, are very much considered risky assets,"" Mati Greenspan, founder of the research firm Quantum Economics, wrote Thursday in an email to subscribers.      Bitcoin is trading well below its price average for the past 50 and 100 days, typically a bearish signal.      As reported by Cawrey, the U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% off its three-month lows Thursday, potentially indicating that investors were looking to classic safe-haven assets, which include cash as well as gold. Prices for the yellow metal were down Thursday, but less than 1%.      Since March, bitcoin's price has shown a weak but consistent correlation with both gold and stock prices. According to Greenspan, that might be a sign of bitcoin's increasing adoption by investors.      ""The fact that bitcoin had any reaction at all to the Fed yesterday is a clear sign that either a) institutional money is playing a much larger role in the market these days, or b) retail traders are getting more savvy and reacting more to their surroundings,"" Greenspan wrote. ""Either way, the market is growing up fast.""    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,444 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,810 | 24-Hr Low: $9,108      Trend: Bitcoin is back up near $9,450 at press time, having put in a low of $9,112 during the U.S. trading hours on Thursday.      The cryptocurrency fell by over 6% as stock markets across the globe cratered on renewed growth concerns and fears that a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic would wreak further economic havoc.      The risk sentiment, however, looks to have stabilized somewhat over the last few hours with futures tied to the S&P 500 gaining over 1%. European equities, too, are reporting modest gains. Bitcoin could rebound further if the stock market recovery gathers pace.      However, the odds look stacked in the other direction.      The U.S. bond market has priced out the prospects of a V-shaped economic recovery. Meanwhile, a second wave of coronavirus seems to have hit the U.S. states of Texas, Florida and California, even as some emerging market economies are still experiencing their first waves.      There are also concerns that the stock market has risen too far from the lows seen in March on the back of unprecedented liquidity injections by central banks across the globe, and has lost touch with the reality that the economy may take years to recover. As a result, equities are likely to remain under pressure in the short term and keep bitcoin on the defensive.      The cryptocurrency's technical charts are also painting a bearish picture. Thursday's decline validated a bearish divergence of the three-day chart's relative strength index and marked a downside break of the eight-day restricted trading range between $9,350 and $10,000.      The range breakdown, coupled with sub-zero reading on the MACD, indicate scope for a drop to support at $8,630 (May 27 low). On the higher side, $10,000 is still the level to beat for the bulls.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Daniel Cawrey, Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/12/first-mover-bitcoin-recouples-with-wall-street-as-stocks-tumble-fear-trade-returns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d1a6061c2656056ece0557c345b8c908ca75ff9-1500x1094.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383960,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zSmR,1591961973,Why Bitcoin Suddenly Dropped 6% on Thursday,"The week-long calm in the bitcoin market ended with a sudden $800 price drop on Thursday.      The over-6% drop saw the top cryptocurrency by market value register its biggest single-day decline in two weeks, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Prices briefly hit lows near $9,100, a level last seen on May 27.      There's three likely factors as to why this happened:    Stock market sell-off    Global equities cratered and traditional safe havens like U.S. government bonds and the Japanese yen gained value as comments by the U.S. Federal Reserve that the economy may take years to recover gave a reality check to investors hoping for a V-shaped recovery.      Bitcoin initially showed resilience by holding above $9,700 during the Asian and European trading hours. However, the sell-off in U.S. equities was too big to ignore for the crypto market traders – some of whom likely offered bitcoin on the fear that financial markets could be about to witness another round of panic like that seen in March.      The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 1,800 points on Thursday, reviving memories of multiple 1000 point drops seen during the first half of March.      Read more: ETH Whale Pays $5.2M in Fees for 2 Mysterious Transfers Totaling $82K [Updated]      A few observers had warned of an impending price drop in conversation with CoinDesk during Thursday’s European trading hours. At that time, bitcoin was trading near $9,800.      “A switch to ‘risk-off’ in global markets could lead to further downside pressure for major cryptocurrencies,” Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds, told CoinDesk.    Dump fears    Big on-chain transactions, especially ones related to controversial wallets and addresses, can create panic in the cryptocurrency markets. That's because, in the past, malicious entities have liquidated stolen coins in the market, causing sudden price declines.      On Thursday, hackers moved over 400 BTC (or $4.1 million worth of cryptocurrency) stolen from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex to unknown wallets, according to twitter bot Whale Alert.      These transfers happened in 20 transactions during the Asian hours and were noted by the crypto market community. A few investors then began speculating about a price dump. At that time, bitcoin was hovering around $9,900.      Another big transaction worth $1.3 billion executed by an unknown wallet also elicited a similar response from the investor community.      Fears that so-called ""whales"" are preparing to dump large numbers of coins may have caused some bulls to exit the market. Further, savvy traders may have taken short positions in anticipation of the big dump, likely accentuating bearish pressures.    Charts leaned bearish    Technical traders had a strong reason to sell bitcoins, as the charts were reporting uptrend exhaustion.      The cryptocurrency has failed multiple times to establish a lasting foothold above $10,000 since the May 11 mining reward halving. Markets often test dip demand following multiple rejections at key resistance.      A bearish divergence of a key three-day chart indicator was also suggesting scope for a price pullback.      Thursday’s price decline has only strengthened the case for a deeper pullback. The slide to $9,100 marked a downside break of the eight-day restricted trading range of $9,350–$10,000.      Additionally, the daily chart's relative strength index has dropped into the bearish territory below 50. Analysts see strong support around $9,100, which, if breached, would invite stronger selling pressure.

42383952,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zSdd,1591952400,National Science Foundation Funds Research Into Crypto Dollars,"The National Science Foundation has given blockchain startup KRNC $225,000 to design cryptocurrency features for the U.S. dollar.      The National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the U.S. federal government, awarded a $225,000 grant to private blockchain startup KRNC to design crypto features for the dollar at a time when the digital dollar is a topic of national debate.      Key Retroactivity Network Consensus, or KRNC, is a protocol that would allocate a scarce cryptocurrency like bitcoin to fiat dollars. The digital currency will be distributed free of charge to users in proportion to their already existing wealth, so anyone who holds dollars can interact with decentralized applications without having to purchase cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ether.      To receive the funding, the KRNC proposal was reviewed by a panel of external industry experts and evaluated for its merit and commercial potential. Anna Brady-Estevez, the National Science Foundation program manager for the grant, said the agency had no mandates for specific end-uses for any of its awards to small businesses.      “We focus on projects where there is meaningful technical work to be done with the potential to drive competitive advantage and impact commercially,” Estevez said.      Read more: Digital Dollar Project Calls for 2-Tiered Distribution System in First White Paper for US CBDC      According to Estevez, the project showed potential in developing a new technology that enhances the security of financial transactions.      “Our funding of this protocol shouldn’t be misconstrued as an endorsement of any initiative to upgrade the U.S. dollar or make it more like bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for that matter,” Estevez said.    ‘Proof-of-Balance’    According to KRNC CEO and chief scientist Clint Ehrlich, the protocol is based on a concept of his own invention: Proof-of-Balance.      “Bitcoin, which runs on the principle of Proof-of-Work, is wasteful,” Ehrlich said. “It requires people to waste money and computing power solving pointless problems.”      KRNC would take the approach of measuring the assets that people already own, like the dollar, and assigning voting power in proportion to an individual’s existing wealth.      One feature KRNC is particularly interested in including in its cryptocurrency is scarcity, inspired by bitcoin often likened to gold. Ehrlich plans to ensure the scarcity of his digital gold by freezing the supply at the time of launch.      “If today, there is $15 trillion when the currency is launched, it will be possible to only ever unlock 15 trillion [crypto] dollars,” Ehrlich said.      Users who wish to acquire digital gold can deposit fiat money in banks during the period of allocation and be assigned free currency. Once the currency is assigned, users are free to purchase goods and services or trade the gold in the same way as bitcoin. Users can also choose to spend or trade the digital gold separately from their fiat money, or use it as a weighted dollar.      “They’re getting the fiat dollar and the gold so that if there is a shift in the price of either one they’re protected from the risk of that volatility,” Ehrlich said.      According to Ehrlich, Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work and honest majority system works like an auction where whoever pays the highest cost through mining is in control of the blockchain.      “KRNC is asymmetric so even if an adversary tries to purchase a larger stake, as long as the initial majority of all the fiat money is owned by honest agents the system can remain secure. It’s a way to provide superior security at zero cost,” he said. “The playing field is not limited to a few buyers and miners but the billions of people who own fiat money.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/12/national-science-foundation-funds-research-into-crypto-dollars,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73496514a61a3d023ce6616f8262b1d1dbf8e66c-1200x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383954,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zShP,1591948877,Why This Dev Built a 'Centralized Ethereum' on Top of Bitcoin's Lightning Network,"Ethereum was created to carry out complex applications Bitcoin supposedly couldn’t handle. A new app brings the idea full circle.      Pseudonymous developer Fiatjaf has created Etleneum, which he describes as a ""centralized"" version of Ethereum that runs on payments from Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Hence the name, a portmanteau of “Ethereum” and “Lightning.” (If that’s too subtle, the Etleneum logo is a diamond shape like Ethereum’s with a lightning bolt running through it.)      Like Ethereum, Etleneum has ""contracts,"" automated agreements over what rules need to be met before money can be dispensed. The contracts are public like Ethereum’s, and like the world’s second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, Fiatjaf’s platform is open to anyone to use.      But it is not decentralized. Fiatjaf controls it all – as he is quick to note.      ""Lots of people think I invented some kind of decentralized trustless smart contract platform on Lightning, which would be amazing and probably impossible, but then they're frustrated when I deny it,"" he said.      It sounds odd, since the whole point of Bitcoin and Ethereum is decentralization – wrestling control from one ruler or entity.      But Fiatjaf argues there are limits to what can be totally decentralized, and that this particular mixed set-up might prove to be more useful.    Open contracts    Etleneum went live in October. The app has garnered 200 registered users and 1,200 total calls to use the system, for either making or participating in the contracts. That’s a blip compared to Ethereum, which boasts give or take 1,000 transactions a day and just crossed 100 million accounts.      Fiatjaf’s platform allows ""two or more mutually distrusting parties ... to run some arbitrary code that will determine what happens with some quantity of money, all guaranteed by a third party trusted by all involved,"" he said.      ""If that was possible with a normal fiat bank, it would be pretty interesting already,"" he said. ""Today we have some apps doing basically that"" [accepting money deposits and executing code that determines where that money will go].      He gave the example of Google AdSense, which allows users to get paid for posting advertisements on their websites based on how many clicks the ads get.      ""But it's always a fixed, predefined ‘contract', never an open platform for anyone to publish any kind of useless or stupid or small or big or useful contract,” Fiatjaf said.      See also: Lightning Network Overhaul Could Strengthen Bitcoin Privacy – But Many ‘Ifs’ Remain      The limitations of traditional payment systems make the type of open payments Fiatjaf envisions impractical. Fees charged by card-issuing banks or PayPal aren't negligible, discouraging smaller payouts. Not to mention, these apps almost always require identification.      ""In the fiat world that's very hard to do, even when you can accept payments with credit cards you can't send money to a random visitor,” Fiatjaf said. “There are very few examples of services out there that pay people, and normally the payee must go through some verification process, link their bank account, it's restricted to some countries and jurisdictions.""    Use cases and compliance    The Lightning Network allows Etleneum to get around these limitations. As in Bitcoin proper (and Ethereum, for that matter), there’s no requirement to tie an identity to an account or payment. And since payments are sent back and forth between parties off the Bitcoin blockchain until final settlement, it's speedier, cheaper, and more scalable.      The basic example of a use case that Etleneum gives is of a wealthy person putting free money into a contract. Then, poorer users can simply take the money if they call the contract.      A common use case for Ethereum is oracles, where two parties, for example, make a bet based on some future data point, such as how much a stock will be worth on a certain date.      A trusted source (the ""oracle"") submits the data and the money will be dispersed to whoever won the bet.      See also: Bitcoiners Sprint to Improve Lightning Network in 2-Day Virtual Hackathon      Etleneum supports this use case, too. Coded agreements can be uploaded to the website for a fee. Then, anyone in the world can utilize them by calling the contract and paying a fee.      When asked about the legal risk of running a centralized platform without identifying users, Fiatjaf sounded unconcerned.      Noting that other custodial lightning apps don't require know-your-customer (KYC) checks and even one of the largest exchanges does not run through KYC for small deposits and withdrawals of bitcoin, he said, “I think I'm fine – hoping that the KYC structure will have fallen to the ground before I get to any meaningful size.""    Decentralization’s limits    If so much of the app is inspired by Ethereum, why not just use Ethereum?      Fiatjaf said he decided to make a centralized version because in his view (shared by many Bitcoiners) Ethereum unintentionally leans towards centralization of power anyway. Etleneum cuts to the chase, cleaving out the parts of Ethereum that try to decentralize power, but don't get the job done.      ""I think [Ethereum] was a cool experiment for a while,"" Fiatjaf said, but over time severe problems became apparent. For one, calling the technology so that it can be used by more than just a few people at once has been a tall order. Most famously, CryptoKitties, a popular app for trading funny-looking virtual cats, managed to single-handedly clog the network, making all apps running on Ethereum slow down as a result.      While Ethereum developers are looking over potential solutions to this scaling issue (some of which are similar to Bitcoin's Lightning), this problem has yet to be solved.      Then there are oracles. In the end, Fiatjaf argued, smart contracts trust third parties to provide correct data.      ""it's not possible to code any useful smart contract there at all due to being impossible to access the external world without trust,"" he said.      Finally, contrary to Ethereum's tenet of decentralization, many of its apps have back doors that can be used to switch them off in case of a critical bug. Similarly, with one ruler, Etleneum allows that party to just shut down a contract if it isn't working properly.      ""Code complexity, bugs, and always-necessary contract upgrades will always demand some form of centralization,"" Fiatjaf said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/12/why-this-dev-built-a-centralized-ethereum-on-top-of-bitcoins-lightning-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dce17427cdf5be5844c8a727a9f5dc731e82a11a-1200x621.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As part of the shift, the company will concentrate on two main areas for clients: regulation and technicals.      ""Through our API, platforms can own the complete client experience whilst not taking on any regulatory overhead. This is similar to how 'Banking as a Service' (BAAS) provides access to traditional rails,"" the company wrote.
