Funding Rates Refuse To Budge Coming out of the last week has been a hard one for the crypto market. The bloodbath had sent the majority of the coins in the crypto market into the red and bitcoin had touched the $20,000 level for the first time since December 2020.

Currently, the Bitcoin network is at 766 days away from this event as it approaches a critical support zone. As seen below, when these two events coincide, BTC&apos;s price can resume bullish momentum and reclaim previous highs.

U.S. senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) recently introduced a wide-reaching crypto legislation bill that many have seen as giving the CFTC greater regulatory oversight than the SEC.

42415237,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRe2D,1655413192,"Market Wrap: Bottom Has Not Been Reached for Crypto, but Capitulation Is Needed","Bitcoin’s (BTC) price fell back to a low of $20,755 on Thursday. It got close to $23,000 after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reassured investors Wednesday the central bank is committed to its current monetary hawkishness. He spoke at a press conference after the Fed raised interest rates by 75 basis points.  Similarly, SOL and DOGE, which both had the highest gains by rising as much as 16% during the rally, fell back to the levels they held prior to Powell’s comments.  The same scenario occurred after the Fed’s previous meeting in May. At that time both stocks and crypto rallied during Powell’s post-meeting press conference when he explained that rate hike. The reality check came the next day.  Bitcoin came close to hitting $20,000 in the past 24 hours, a threshold that could potentially trigger large liquidations. But this likely isn’t the bottom yet, said Apifiny CEO Haohan Xu, given the lack of bullish sentiment and worsening liquidity.  “With the rate hike, we will actually see decreasing yield in the crypto space across all assets,” he wrote in a note. “Borrowing has been very important for anyone participating in the crypto market, whether it's traders trying to profit from contango or market makers trying to arbitrage across exchanges.”  In contango, a commodity’s futures price exceeds its spot price. Xu noted, “With the fading contango and the narrowing spread in the crypto market recently, institutions see less incentive in running those strategies and thus have less need to borrow. All of the above combined with the general market condition will force high yield providers to cut rates to a much lower level.""  Billionaire investor and ""Shark Tank"" host Kevin O’Leary told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" Thursday the crypto market hasn’t hit bottom yet, but capitulation is needed and is “a good thing” before crypto can see another, longer-term rally. Capitulation describes the dramatic surge of selling pressure in a declining market or security that marks a mass surrender by investors.

Sell the Ethereum Merge  By Andy Edstrom  Many market participants think the highly anticipated Ethereum Merge, when the blockchain moves to a proof-of-stake consensus method, will be bullish for ETH. The opposite is more likely.  People tend to get excited about the prospects of these sorts of widely anticipated developments and think they will usher in price gains. But such occurrences tend to be “sell the news” events.  The Merge has two possible outcomes: Either it works or it doesn't. If the Merge doesn't work, that seems unlikely to be good for the price of ether. But if it does work, that also seems unlikely to be good for the price of ETH because a proof-of-stake-based ETH will now directly compete for investor/speculator market share against the panoply of other major proof-of-stake-based digital assets.  I have no idea whether the dollar price of ether will go up or down between now and when the Merge happens. And I have no idea whether the Merge will happen at all, considering that it's been delayed for so many years. But if I read the news one day, and it says the Merge has happened, I expect that news to be sellable.  Read the full story here.

42394039,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucj4x,1655411207,From Mixtapes to NFTs: French Montana on Music and Crypto,"French Montana is making a change in his music. The multiplatinum-selling rapper said it’s because he finally owns all of his music rights.  “I found a way to grow closer with my fans,” Montana said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program ahead of the French Family PNP non-fungible token (NFT) collection launch.  Montana, who emigrated from Morocco to the Bronx at the age of 13, told CoinDesk that owning the rights to his music has given him the freedom to “give people exactly what they’re worth when they come and spend their time and money with you.”  The collection consists of 10,000 NFTs, each of which unlocks NFT music rights to Montana’s upcoming album, “Montega.” Rare NFTs, also included in the collection, will give backstage access to Montana’s global concerts for nearly three years, starting June 20, 2022. Buyers of super-rare NFTs, or those linked directly with the Montega music NFT (MTG), will have commercial rights to “Montega,” as well as rights to performances, remixes and resell.  Read more: What Are Music NFTs?  The three-time Grammy nominated rapper adds that it is an opportunity for fans to get up close and personal with him, in addition to gaining a private club membership to the USM Metaverse, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DAO lets users earn money across various verticals, including gaming, music and even virtual land ownership.  Fifteen years ago, Montana got his start in the music industry by selling mixtapes and DVDs. Now, the ecosystem looks vastly different, and he’s aiming to keep up.  “When I first started, when I did the DVDs, I felt like the Christopher Columbus to the game,” he said. “I kind of feel the same way with NFTs.”  Ahead of his album release, Montana is looking to capitalize on the NFT craze, which prompted users last year to send $44 billion worth of cryptocurrency to smart contracts associated with NFT marketplaces and collections, according to Chainalysis.  Montana told CoinDesk that he held off jumping into NFTs until he felt he was ready to bring something unique to the table.  “Only the strong survive at this point,” he said regarding the future of NFTs.  Nonetheless, this isn’t Montana’s first foray into NFTs. In November, he promoted NFTs tied to his footwear line, Coke Boys, manufactured by LA Sneaker. And in April, he was one of many bold-faced names to promote an NFT series called Bored Bunny, a send-up of Bored Apes and which many accuse of being a rug pull.  Read more: NFT Scams: How to Avoid Falling Victim  When asked if he’s wary about investing in celebrity-endorsed projects like the Bored Bunny collection, which made a number of empty promises to users before going rogue, Montana said, “I make honest investments in things that I believe in.”  The changing music industry  Montana points to platforms like TikTok and Instagram, which have catapulted artists into the mainstream, all while democratizing and leveling the playing field in the music business, to a certain degree.  Now, Montana wants to be in control of his brand. “I’m glad I’m able to capitalize off of my own creative,” he said, and advises new artists to do the same.  “That’s what gave me the leverage to even be here and to come out with this French Family PFP,” he said.  Montana’s French Family PFP NFT, which will be available on the USM Metaverse, will be released via an airdrop on Monday, June 20.

The amount represents 400% growth compared with the same period in 2021, the company said, adding that it hopes to process $2 billion in global remittances to Mexico alone in 2022.  “There’s no doubt that the Mexico-U.S. corridor is an extremely important market for us. Many people within that corridor depend on remittances to meet their basic needs and this drives our commitment to bring these cross-border payment services to other countries where we operate,” said a statement from Carlos Lovera, Bitso's business development leader.  Bitso processed 4% of global remittances sent to Mexico in the first quarter of 2022, according to the company, which added that it aims to reach 10% of the market by 2023.  “When we started the company, we talked about the potential for crypto to be used for remittances and I was dreaming about a world where Bitso could process 1% of the remittances from the U.S. to Mexico,” Bitso CEO Daniel Vogel told CoinDesk at Consensus 2022.  Read more: Mexican Remittances Are the Continent’s Largest; Crypto Companies Want a Cut  Bitso, which operates in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, reached 5 million users in June. The company recently laid off 80 employees, citing its “long-term business strategy,” although it did not mention any difficulties in raising capital.  In November, Bitso partnered with Circle to launch an international wire transfer product that allows small businesses and freelancers to change their dollars into stablecoins and then convert them to Mexican pesos.  One month later, the exchange partnered with Tribal Credit to launch a cross-border B2B payment option enabling the conversion of Mexican pesos to Stellar USDC for transactions between Mexico and the U.S.  According to the World Bank, Mexico was the second-largest recipient of remittances in the world in 2021, after India. Of the $51.6 billion it received last year, 95% came from the U.S., according to the Mexican central bank.  The Mexican remittance market has caught the attention of global crypto players. In May, Tether launched its MXNT token pegged to Mexico's peso, while in February, Coinbase (COIN) enabled a cash-out service in Mexico to convert crypto into fiat.",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDC,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/16/bitso-processed-1b-in-crypto-remittances-between-mexico-and-the-us-in-first-half-of-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fe0c37a243e33b1a6ef3039142c8d89a7db8d88-1467x1100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""It would make sense to integrate payments into Twitter so it's easy to send money back and forth.""  Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has an agreement in place to purchase Twitter for $44 billion. Despite some public wavering about completing the deal, the purchase appears to be on track, and Musk's attendance at Thursday's meeting suggests some level of commitment.  Twitter has already tiptoed into cryptocurrency, incorporating bitcoin (BTC) tipping in 2021 under then-CEO Jack Dorsey, and adding ether (ETH) functionality early this year. Twitter also became the first company to try out a new program from payments processor Stripe, which in April announced a feature enabling payments in USDC via Polygon.

On June 12, the crypto lending platform published a blog post announcing that it would pause withdrawals, as well as its swap and transfer products, citing “extreme market conditions.” Rumors of the company’s insolvency spread quickly across social media, sparking panic and sell-offs in the markets.  Joe Rotunda, the director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) , told CoinDesk that his team learned of the account freeze through social media and met early on Monday morning to begin the investigation.  “I am very concerned that clients – including many retail investors – may need to immediately access their assets yet are unable to withdraw from their accounts,” Rotunda said to Reuters. “The inability to access their investment may result in significant financial consequences.”  Joe Borg, the director of the Alabama Securities Commission, told CoinDesk he sees the investigation into Celsius’ freezing of customer accounts as a “new wrinkle” in an ongoing investigation.  “We’ve been working with Celsius for a while,” Borg told CoinDesk. “We’ve asked for lots more information, and they’re providing it.  “We’ll continue the investigation as to the company and whether or not we’re going to do the BlockFi model – whether they’re capable of it,” Borg added, referencing BlockFi’s $100 million settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and 32 states reached in February.  This is not Celsius’ first brush with Texas’ state securities regulators, who began looking into the platform’s crypto interest accounts – which advertised returns of up to 17% – last September.  Other states – including New Jersey, which filed a cease-and-desist order against Celsius – quickly followed suit.

We expect this transition, known as &apos;The Merge&apos; in the industry, to occur very soon. What is &apos;The Merge&apos;? Ethereum functions similarly to Bitcoin because a decentralized network of computers competing to solve mathematical puzzles is responsible for mining transactions. In exchange for solving the puzzle, the reward is new ETH coins. However, the process by which computers determine which transactions should be added to a block, known as proof of work, is extremely energy-intensive. As a result, Ethereum will likely switch to a consensus algorithm that consumes significantly less energy, allowing the network to be 99 percent more energy efficient. The term given to Ethereum&apos;s new protocol is proof of stake. In proof of stake, transactions are validated by addresses that have staked — or pledged to a smart contract — a significant quantity of ETH. Those who staked more ETH receive a larger portion of the reward. Since the first blockchain launch in 2015, the Ethereum community has been working to transition to proof-of-stake. The Merge is one of a series of upgrades that will make Ethereum faster and less expensive to use. Ethereum&apos;s downside is its long transaction times and high transaction fees. For example, during times of heavy congestion, simple $1 token exchanges on Uniswap can incur transaction fees of more than $50.

42394205,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZh5P,1655399163,The Case for Technological Neutrality in Web3,"The cliche is that the only things unavoidable in life are death and taxes. We can probably add new technology to the list, too. Artificial intelligence (AI), the metaverse, autonomous vehicles, flying cars – they’re all coming.  Lawmakers, if they want to be on top of a paradigm shift, should approach tech regulation in a way that is thoughtful, perceptive and comprehensive. But reaching consensus in our statehouses is challenging and finding any sort of common ground in Washington, D.C., is virtually impossible.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Making matters worse, a comprehensive approach to tech policy typically occurs only after some crisis forces legislators’ hands and the media is all over them, only increasing the risk that the law is hasty or ill-conceived.  While new regulatory frameworks will be needed in some areas of Web3 – the version of the internet driven by blockchain – there are other areas where innovators and investors can move the ball forward on the basis of existing laws and regulations, all the while simplifying the task for policymakers.  So let’s talk about technological neutrality.  By “technological neutrality” in the context of Web3 and tech innovation, we mean this: If new technology enables activities that are mostly the same as existing activities, let’s start with an assumption that the law treats the two activities similarly.  Said differently, wherever possible, the law should be neutral to the tech and any variations in legal treatment should come from (and be tailored to) material variations in the business or risks associated with the technology.  U.S. President Joseph Biden’s recent executive order on crypto, while leaving a whole lot unsettled, gives an implicit nod to this approach when declaring, “same business, same risks, same rules.” The crypto community will likely hate the approach the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) takes, but at least it’s now in a context we can all understand.  See also: As Federal Agencies Organize, US States Continue to Lead in Digital Asset Regulation | Opinion  In Web3 and crypto, regulators and innovators alike have at times gotten this backward. For instance, in the midst of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom; an SEC chair once said every ICO token he had seen was a security. That suggested, although digital tokens on distributed ledgers are infinitely variable and could represent anything from book club points to stock in a corporation, legal risks in Web3 stem from the technology rather than what lawyers call a substantive activity.  Under this paradigm, tokens on distributed ledgers were/are “high risk.” However, that hardly makes sense. This type of thinking is no doubt part of the U.S.’s inability to effectively regulate crypto currently and – if we don’t learn from it – Web3 in the future.  Seeking a unified regulatory scheme to oversee “distributed ledgers” – a general purpose technology with highly variable uses – is like seeking a unified regulatory scheme for uses for spreadsheets.  Appropriate oversight  Rather than starting with the technology as the bucketing function, let’s start with how people actually use the technology (their substantive activities), and the presumption that blockchain tech is irrelevant.  What is the business? What rights are being created between parties? How are those rights communicated from seller to buyer? What risks are associated with the business?  If we start with these questions, we usually find that there is relevant precedent in the existing laws, regulations or case law. And more importantly, if innovators, investors and regulators can use this as a shared starting point, we could take a couple of significant steps.  First, tech innovators and investors should have a common framework to assess risk associated with leading edge businesses. A vague sense that Web3 businesses are “risky” can be replaced by targeted questions and answers. What existing businesses does this most resemble? How are those businesses regulated? How is this business different from those businesses? Which of those differences are legally significant, and what are you doing to address risks stemming from that? What here actually impacts regular people and how?  Second, the task for policymakers can be simplified. With a technology as broad as Web3 and crypto, asking a regulator for clarity on Web3 and crypto is understandably daunting. The internet is a broad technology, and regulation would, of course, change depending on whether you’re discussing ecommerce or social networking, consumer protection or data privacy, etc.  If our starting point of technological neutrality can get us good answers on most issues associated with a particular Web3 activity, we can then rely on policymakers for a smaller subset of truly novel issues.  See also: Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi Is Still Optimistic in the Crypto Winter | The Node  There will inevitably be areas where comprehensive rulemaking and legislation are needed – and industry should not be shy about advocating for that. But there will also be vast swaths of Web3 and crypto that are simply new ways to do the same old things. Not everything is revolutionary. And where that’s the case, let’s lean in on what clarity does exist under the law.  In other words if the government’s failure to properly understand and regulate Web2 has taught us anything, it’s that we need to make this a lot easier for them. Even if we do, they still may drop the ball. Or their politics may cause them to favor entrenched interests regardless of the impact of any particular Web3 business.

It was a brutal decline for investors who watched their BTC portfolios incur losses after losses. Speculations were rampant in the space on what a touch below $20,000 would have meant for the market. The implications were abundant in their impact but the recovery back above $21,000 has staved off the bears, if only for a little while. Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? After the market recovery on Wednesday, it has become apparent that there has been some intervention in the market crash.

42415245,R4kIV9dSBAfNII0fqPRe7s,1655396540,US Treasury Secretary Talks Crypto With Bank Chiefs,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is meeting with the CEOs of Wall Street banks Thursday to discuss the global economy and U.S. inflation, while also raising “the need for responsible innovation in digital assets,” according to the Treasury Department.  That discussion comes as the Treasury closely watches activity in the crypto market, according to a department official who was not authorized to speak on the record. The recent turmoil in crypto is underlining the growing urgency for establishing regulations for the industry, the official said.  While dramatic market swings often push Treasury secretaries to reach out to U.S. financial leaders, Yellen’s meeting with a long list of bank executives had long been scheduled, according to people familiar with the event. Both bankers and the administration have been keen on the subject of cryptocurrency oversight, so that topic is featured on the agenda even as bitcoin and other digital mainstays slide into ever-deeper declines.  In March, President Joe Biden ordered his administration to formulate plans for regulating the crypto industry, and Yellen’s Treasury has been directing much of that work. The reports have started to emerge, with the Department of Justice issuing one earlier this month that said the U.S. should share more information about crimes tied to cryptocurrency and help build up its overseas partnerships to help combat them.  Still, the administration and officials from the U.S. financial agencies routinely say that Congress needs to weigh in to properly authorize the federal government to regulate crypto. That long-awaited intervention is likely to be stymied by politics this year as lawmakers focus on the midterm elections. So, despite some hope from key politicians such as Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) that a bill policing stablecoins could emerge this year, observers expect lawmakers to begin to make more serious progress on any legislation in 2023.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/16/us-treasury-secretary-talks-crypto-with-bank-chiefs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23c29d3a4f8084b72952043f9d59096b8ea00030-3983x2992.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423124,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mvvh,1655395467,Major Banks Urge Caution With European Union's CBDC Plans,"The European Union needs to carefully consider the impact from issuing a digital euro, according to a lobby group representing some of the largest financial services companies.  In a response to a European Commission consultation that closes Thursday, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said there seemed to be an assumption that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a good idea, even though the European Central Bank has yet to reach a decision. It's an assumption that needs to be verified, according to the IIF response seen exclusively by CoinDesk.  The IIF’s 450 members are dominated by commercial and investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), and also include accountancy groups including KPMG, payment networks including Visa (V), the International Monetary Fund and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN).  The IIF wants to see “a clear qualitative and quantitative impact assessment of the range of possible designs of a digital euro,” looking at the “various risks … to financial stability,” Jessica Renier, the IIF's managing director for digital finance, said in an interview.  She contrasted a recent white paper from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which “majors on questions, as to the pros and cons and very much ‘whether’ it is advisable to launch a CBDC; and the [European Commission’s] consultation very much on the ‘how’ question,” she said.  The commission consultation published in April considered the legislation that might be needed to underpin a CBDC. Chief among the IIF’s arguments is that by getting into the details of privacy controls and merchant fees, the commission is already assuming the CBDC is a good idea – and maybe needs to take a step back, CoinDesk was told.  See also: In Long-Awaited CBDC White Paper, Fed Flags Privacy, Financial Stability Risks  It’s hardly the first stumbling block met by the controversial project. At a Wednesday hearing at the European Parliament, the European Central Bank’s executive board member Fabio Panetta said those responding to his own questionnaire on the subject had been “not that enthusiastic, to put it mildly.”  The IIF’s response, which is yet to be made public, highlights that a digital euro could be programmable, allowing it to be automatically transferred as part of smart contracts, and could make it easier to effect cross-border payments, currently a costly and lengthy process.  No more banks?  But those would only work if it has the right design. Renier says there’s little information on, for example, whether the digital euro would work with other payment mechanisms.  Unsurprisingly, Renier doesn’t want the banking sector to be forgotten, arguing that it would likely be the intermediary between central banks and ordinary shoppers. For others – among them EU lawmaker Luis Garicano, who wants the ECB to think bigger – Web 3 is a chance to transform the financial system.  See also: Europe's CBDC Designers Wrestle With Privacy Issues  “I wanted to make you kind of try to think a little bit out loud about the alternative solution, which is we don't handicap this project and we let it go where it runs,” Garicano told Panetta at the hearing on Wednesday. He said the CBDC is a chance to prize apart the dual role of banks, between safe storers of people’s cash and riskier lending activities.  Renier, like Panetta, is cautious about any approach that would sideline banks, the source of much lending and credit in the economy.  Doing away with the banks’ role would “would be extremely detrimental to financial stability and the economy,” Renier said. “That is good for no one ... you can't exist without the banking system.”  ""I would say a retail CBC certainly poses some potential challenges and risks. They're not insurmountable challenges. But it's important that we work through some of those challenges and risks ahead of time,"" she said. ""The IIF supports the European Commission's efforts to collect answers on on these questions"" of design.""

Will the reversal break below $0.22? Key technical points: The market price has increased 10.15% over the past 24 hours. The price action shows a reversal from the $0.30 mark. The 24-hour trading volume of IOTA is $27.50 Million, indicating a hike of 16.53%. Past Performance of IOTA During last weekend&apos;s selling spree, IOTA prices broke under the consolidation range between the $0.30 and $0.37 marks. The selling spree starts after the evening star pattern at $0.37 to reach the $0.22 level before reversing to retest the bearish breakout. Source- Tradingview IOTA Technical Analysis IOTA prices plunge after the successful retest of the $0.30 mark resulting in a 5% fall today. Hence, we can shortly see the prices surpass the $0.22 mark to test the upcoming support level at $0.15. The falling trend of the crucial daily EMAs - 50, 100, and 200-days showcase an increase in bearish spread. Moreover, the EMAs will provide dynamic resistance to any bullish reversals in near future. The daily-RSI slope displays a V-shaped reversal, but the bearish influence of the 14-day SMA undermines the reverse pushing it back to the 30% boundary.

The acquisition takes Animoca Brands' stake in TinyTap to 84.1%.  TinyTap, founded in 2012, is a platform that enables educators to create and post content – a model known as user-generated content (UGC) – while earning a usage-based share of revenue. The Tel Aviv, Israel-based company is the world’s largest educational games library, offering some 200,000 activities from educators and publishers, including Sesame Street and Oxford University Press, according to the release.  Earlier this year, Animoca raised almost $360 million in a funding round at a valuation of $5.5 billion. Last week it revealed that its investment portfolio stood at $1.5 billion.  Animoca said it will use TinyTap's platform to generate educational blockchain-related content.  ""With our acquisition of TinyTap – a strong and proven leader in the field of UGC education – we will leverage blockchain to make new opportunities available to educators worldwide, allowing them to generate equity from their creations while offering parents enhanced learning opportunities for their kids,” said Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands.  ""We empower educators to create engaging learning activities that can reach millions of kids directly and that enable them to earn based on the success of their creations,"" TinyTap CEO Yogev Shelly said.

42423114,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mvbh,1655386200,Espresso Systems Launches Testnet of CAPE Privacy Product,"Espresso Systems, a scaling and privacy system for Web 3 applications, has launched its first product in testnet. Configurable Asset Privacy on Ethereum (CAPE) is a smart contract application that lets asset creators define customizable privacy policies that determine who can see what information about the asset holders and transactions under certain circumstances.  The launch comes three months after Espresso Systems raised $32 million in a funding round led by Greylock Partners and Electric Capital, with participation from Sequoia Capital.  According to one company official, Web 3 tends to have a black and white approach to privacy, where it’s either everything you do is transparent to all people all of the time or – in the case of Zcash or Tornado – everything is shielded from view in most cases.  “What we're trying to do is crack open the area in the middle to make privacy a flexible, programmable, configurable feature of how we interact with Web 3 products,” Espresso Systems co-founder Jill Gunter told CoinDesk in an interview. “With CAPE, this is our first showcase of the functionality that we've developed.”  CAPE is “specifically oriented towards being able to configure different privacy policies for different assets, such that different people under different circumstances will be able to see different transactional data about what’s happening within a given asset,” she continued.  The need for some form of privacy in Web 3 is often touted as the path to bringing more companies and institutions into crypto. Gunter noted that the implications of CAPE could be important for institutional players, for example, who might want to get involved with crypto but don’t want to leak their proprietary data or investment strategies to the whole world.  “One of the Holy Grail use cases that we've yet to see really play out is payments,” said Gunter. “If you talk to businesses [that] have explored or dabbled in crypto as they’ve looked into paying cross-border payroll or even [peer-to-peer] payments, one of the first big things that they’ll bring up is, ‘Well, there is no privacy there.’ [T]hat has precluded a lot of these big more incumbent-style users from really meaningfully exploring these different types of use cases.”  CAPE also has crypto-native use cases. A stablecoin provider with a U.S. dollar product could hide user transactions from the general public while the issuer maintains real-time insights. A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) could move its treasury into CAPE to limit access to balance and transaction information to just the administrators.  Espresso has released the wallet and graphical user interface for CAPE on Ethereum’s Goeril testnet for users to start building.  CAPE is the first showcase of the underlying Espresso Systems solution for scalability and privacy on Ethereum. Espresso is building a layer 1 blockchain that will be Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible. The first testnet on the scalability side is expected later this summer.  “It's very difficult building [layer 1] infrastructure. You really get one shot at deploying, and we didn't want to just go away for the next year until we have built out an end user product around a mainnet launch,” Gunter explained. “We wanted to start putting our products out into the public to be able to get people using the product, getting their hands dirty, and getting their feedback.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | ZEC,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/16/espresso-systems-launches-testnet-of-cape-privacy-solution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5644c3e52d66b611cd6069d915670f4f1d6c5aa-1520x1140.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In 1 week, sellers managed to lower the SOL price by 81%. Buyers did not offer much resistance and this is clearly seen in the trading volumes in the weekly timeframe. The SOL price has not yet found a solid bottom to complete the fall wave. The first hope for the $47 range was in vain. The next liquidation zone, where buyers have a high chance to start at least a rebound of the SOL price is $22.6. This liquidity zone was the lower limit of consolidation in April-August 2021. Maintaining this mark allowed buyers to continue their growth trend with a final target of $259.9. If the SOL price stops around $22.6, we expect a rebound to $47 and the price stops in this consolidation corridor again. Below the $22.6 mark, there are virtually no liquidity zones where buyers have accumulated their positions and for which they will be ready to fight. Therefore, if you lose control of the $22.6 mark, it will be extremely dangerous for buyers to invest in SOL.

42423108,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2MvNh,1655384400,CleanSpark Takes Advantage of Bear Market to Acquire Mining Rig Contracts,"CleanSpark (CLSK), is taking advantage of the bear market and falling prices for bitcoin mining rigs by buying existing purchase contracts from another miner for 1,800 Antminer S19 XP computers.  The Las Vegas-based, sustainable bitcoin miner said in a statement that the machines will add over 252 petahashes per second (PH/s) of hashrate to CleanSpark’s bitcoin mining capacity, once fully deployed. The bitcoin mining specific computers, called ASICs, will start arriving at CleanSpark's facilities in August, and shipping will continue through the next six months. The miner currently has 25,000 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate over 2.5 EH/s.  The miner took advantage of the recent market conditions, where a sell-off in bitcoin prices has led to a decline in ASICs prices. A tough capital market and difficulty in securing power purchase agreements by miners have also caused an excess supply of ASICs – which cannot be plugged in to mine bitcoins – contributing to the lower prices of the mining rigs.  Due to lack of funding, miners have not been able to fulfill previous orders of mining rigs for which they have paid deposits. “With our research that we have done, we found that a sample set of public miners still owe $1.9 billion this year, for the ASIC purchases that they've committed to,” said Galaxy Digital’s head of mining Amanda Fabiano during a panel discussion at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas.  The current conditions have given CleanSpark and other miners an opportunity to buy mining rigs at lower prices for expanding their operations. “We were able to secure the contract at an exceptional price because of our strategic relationships and the unique circumstances that current market conditions have created,” CEO Zach Bradford said.  The contract was brokered by Cryptech, a U.S. based supplier of cryptocurrency mining machines and longtime partner of the miner, according to the statement.  CleanSpark didn’t specify the prices for the contracts but a source close to the matter said that it has paid less than the spot prices for the rigs. The prices for latest generation ASICs have traded around $60 per terahash ($/TH), the lowest since July last year when China banned mining, according to Luxor Technologies’ Hashrate Index data. The prices topped just over $100/TH in December, the data suggests.  CleanSpark also announced a partnership with TMGcore, a developer of high performance computing solutions, to expand its immersion-cooled infrastructure for bitcoin mining. The deal includes 257 units of TMGcore’s proprietary immersion cooled tanks that are specifically designed to improve the performance of mining machines while substantially decreasing their failure rates over long-term use, according to the statement.  In liquid immersion cooling, which is an alternative to traditional air-cooling systems, mining machines are fully immersed in a synthetic hydrocarbon compound liquid that has no electrical conductivity and is fully biodegradable. The specialized liquid can reduce heat, power consumption and noise stemming from the computers as well as prolong the lifespan of the machines, allowing miners to maximize profit.  Each tank fits 28 Antminer S19j Pro mining machines and the units will be deployed in batches at CleanSpark’s College Park, Ga., property and other locations. The partnership also provides CleanSpark with 2 megawatts (MW) of colocation capacity at TMGcore’s immersion-cooled mining facility in Plano, Texas.  In December, CleanSpark bought 20MW immersion cooling infrastructure for its Norcross, Ga., bitcoin mining facility. Eight of the datacenter's 20MW capacity are already fully operational, while the remaining 12 MW are expected later this year, according to Wednesday’s statement.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/16/cleanspark-takes-advantage-of-bear-market-to-take-over-mining-rig-contracts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/483119855dd6cf897a6fc306c7e20ffd9939ad23-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42423119,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mvjh,1655384400,USDC Issuer Circle to Introduce Euro-Backed Stablecoin in US,"Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of the USD Coin (USDC) dollar-pegged stablecoin, is set to introduce a new token by the end of the month – this one backed by the single European currency.  The Euro Coin (EUROC) will be fully backed by euro-denominated reserves held in the custody of financial institutions that fall “within the U.S. regulatory perimeter,” the company announced Thursday. One such institution will be San Diego-based Silvergate Bank, the company said.  EUROC joins a short list of euro-backed stablecoins including EURt, issued by Tether, and EURS, from Malta-based Stasis. Tether is also the issuer of the largest dollar-pegged coin, USDT, which has a market cap of more than $70 billion compared with second-largest USDC’s $54 billion.  “Euro Coin is a regulated, euro-backed stablecoin issued under the same full-reserve model and built on the same pillars of trust, transparency, and security that have made USDC one of the world’s most trusted digital currencies,” the statement said.  Following the publication of this article, a representative for Circle told CoinDesk that EUROC reserves will be made up of ""cash and euro government debt only.""  Regulators and lawmakers in the European Union (EU) are in the process of setting up rules for stablecoin issuers looking to serve customers in the bloc’s 27 member states. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation, set to be finalized by the end of June, includes stringent rules particularly for large stablecoin issuers.  It is unclear how a euro-backed stablecoin issued under U.S. standards might be perceived by EU leaders, and how Circle is anticipating the EU’s pending legislation. A representative for Circle told CoinDesk the company will not comment publicly on conversations, or the existence of conversations, with U.S., EU, or other regulators.  “[Stablecoins] are addressed by MiCA because they could indeed raise concerns regarding the EU monetary policy, stability and sovereignty,” Eva Kaili, vice president of the European Parliament told CoinDesk during an interview last year.  Euro Coin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain on June 30 as an ERC-20 standard token. Support for additional blockchains is expected later in the year. According to the announcement, several ecosystems including Anchorage Digital, Binance.US, Bitstamp, FTX, Huobi Global, Ledger and MetaMask Institutional will support the stablecoin at launch.  According to Circle’s official website, Euro Coin is initially only accessible via Silvergate’s Euro SEN network, which requires potential users to have an active banking relationship with the bank. Once trading on exchanges kicks off, people and businesses will be able to trade for Euro Coin and withdraw EUROC from exchanges and put it in Ethereum-compatible wallets, the website said.  The website also says that starting in July, Grant Thornton LLP, a global network of independent accounting and consulting firms, will issue monthly attestations of Euro Coin reserves.  “There is clear market demand for a digital currency denominated in euros, the world’s second most traded currency after the U.S. dollar,” Jeremy Allaire, Circle founder and CEO, said in a press statement.  The euro has weakened against the dollar this year, with some experts projecting it will reach parity by the end of the month.

42394195,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvZgfl,1655383800,Sell the Ethereum Merge,"I don't usually make short-term prognostications about asset prices. But occasionally financial markets lob a fat pitch.  Well-followed traders of digital assets, such as Arthur Hayes, Mark Cuban and Travis Kling, have made very public statements (e.g., here, here and here) about how bullish the upcoming Ethereum Merge will be for the price of ETH.  I think the opposite is more likely.  The most anticipated event in digital assets … ever  If you're reading this article, you've probably heard of the Ethereum Merge. It might be the best-telegraphed technical event in the modern history of digital assets (i.e., since the invention of Bitcoin). It's so anticipated because:  Ether is the second-largest digital asset as measured by network value.  It is a major change to the network, with significant attendant execution risks.  It has been delayed so many times that market participants have had years to analyze it.  People tend to get excited about the prospects of these sorts of widely anticipated developments and think they will usher in price gains. But such occurrences tend to be “sell the news” events.  Prior events like this include the launch of bitcoin (BTC) futures on regulated U.S. exchanges and the approval of the first bitcoin futures ETF (exchange-traded fund). Besides the fact that these events marked long-term peaks in the dollar price of bitcoin and the prices of digital assets in general, they were widely anticipated.  But these watershed events in the development of the bitcoin market also represented changes in the structure of the market for the asset they represented. In the case of bitcoin futures and bitcoin futures ETFs, a new tool was introduced for selling bitcoin without purchasing the underlying spot asset.  The Ethereum Merge represents a similar dynamic because it changes the structure of the markets for digital assets.  Supply shock  Investors and speculators in digital assets (yes, most digital assets are pure speculations), have a number of consensus mechanisms from which to choose. But the largest by far in terms of market capitalization (and, in my opinion, the most secure) is proof-of-work.  Today, proof-of-work secures perhaps three-quarters of the market capitalization, or network value, of all digital assets in existence. (While this measure for asset value is imperfect, it should suffice for this analysis.)  But if Ethereum switches to proof-of-stake, then roughly a fifth of the total network value of proof-of-work digital assets will change to proof-of-stake digital assets.  Don't get me wrong – BTC and ether (ETH), Ethereum's native token, are very different beasts. To me, ETH is no more a substitute for BTC than Meta stock is a substitute for gold. They are both assets, but they are very different.  However, it would be naive to assume that there isn't a large contingent of participants in the markets for digital assets who see some similarities between BTC and ETH that effectively make them partial substitutes in the portfolios of those investors/speculators.  But ether changing to proof-of-stake will reduce ETH's similarity to (and substitutability for) BTC, while simultaneously increasing its similarity to (and substitutability for) various major proof-of-stake assets such as Cardano, Solana, Tron, Avalanche, Algorand and others.  So the Merge will amount to a decrease in total supply of proof-of-work assets and an increase in supply for proof-of-stake assets. All else equal, a reduction in supply for proof-of-work assets implies an increase in the price of the remaining proof-of-work assets (primarily bitcoin) and an increase in the supply of proof-of-stake assets implies a decrease in the price of proof-of-stake assets. Based on current capitalization, the biggest proof-of-stake asset will be ether.  Heads you lose, tails you lose  The Merge has two possible outcomes: Either it works or it doesn't. If the Merge doesn't work, that seems unlikely to be good for the price of ether. But if it does work, that also seems unlikely to be good for the price of ETH because a proof-of-stake-based ETH will now directly compete for investor/speculator market share against the panoply of other major proof-of-stake-based digital assets.  I have no idea whether the dollar price of ether will go up or down between now and when the Merge happens. And I have no idea whether the Merge will happen at all, considering that it's been delayed for so many years. But if I read the news one day, and it says the Merge has happened, I expect that news to be sellable.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,ADA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Andy Edstrom,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/16/sell-the-ethereum-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88a617c6ca68384265eb441829fcccf313167243-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Exploiters seemed to use a flash loan attack to trick the protocol and steal more than 53 bitcoin, worth $1.1 million, and 10,000 tether (USDT), a stablecoin backed on a 1-1 basis with U.S. dollars. The exploit comes just over two months after attackers stole $15 million worth of cryptocurrencies from Inverse Finance in a similar attack, as previously reported.  During European hours Thursday, Inverse Finance developers paused borrowing functions for users and said they were investigating the incident.  Flash loans are a DeFi-specific mechanism allowing users to borrow high amounts of capital on little collateral as long as the loan is paid back within the same transaction. They are generally used by traders, but bad actors may use flash loans to trick a protocol’s smart contract into manipulating prices on liquidity pools and take over that pool’s assets.  Blockchain data apparently shows the exploiters flash-borrowed some 27,000 wrapped bitcoin from lending protocol Aave to conduct the attack. The funds were routed through swap service Curve for various stablecoins before being used to remove DOLA, a stablecoin, from Inverse Finance pools.  An address tagged as “Inverse Finance Exploiter” on blockchain analysis tool Etherscan apparently sent 900 ether, worth $1 million, to privacy mixer Tornado Cash following the exploit, data shows.

The GameFi industry has progressively expanded its dominance, attracting over $22.5 billion in total investments. This era began in late-2020 when Andre Cronje, the founder of Yearn.Finance, introduced the notion of GameFi. His tweet about gamification in a decentralized setting took crypto Twitter by storm. A slew of innovations drove the industry forward steadily since then. NFTs have propelled GameFi to a new level, merging entertainment and financial incentives. Moreover, the metaverse has introduced an additional utility and value layer in this domain. It offers an immersive experience, among other things, to the participants of virtual worlds. Overall, there&apos;s been an intense craze. So much so that several new projects emerge daily. For example, there were 1400+ GameFi projects in May 2022, representing a 99% yearly increase. This is primarily because investors have dedicated billions of dollars to this domain—$2.5 billion in Q1 2022, whereas the total investment last year was $4 billion. Institutions Enter Blockchain Gaming Recently, venture capital funds have gone big on blockchain gaming. Leading investors are doing everything in their capacity to capitalize on GameFi&apos;s immense potential. For example, Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) launched the Games Fund One, investing $600 billion in blockchain gaming.

Saylor, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of MicroStrategy, discussed Bitcoin trading in an interview on Wednesday (June 15). Microstrategy, the largest corporate BTC holder, restated his bullish attitude on the company&apos;s bitcoin strategy and dismissed rumors of a margin call affecting part of the firm&apos;s holdings. Saylor reaffirmed his intention to buy bitcoin in the future. MicroStrategy Continued Collecting Bitcoin MicroStrategy has continued to amass Bitcoin since then, and its CEO has become one of Bitcoin&apos;s most outspoken proponents.

Crypto market capitalization increased some 4.5% after sliding under $1 trillion earlier this week and touching levels previously seen in early 2021. Bitcoin rebounded to the $21,000 level after a dip to just over $20,000.  Bitcoin reversed Wednesday’s decline even as U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell announced a 75 basis-point interest rate increase, the biggest in over 28 years. The move is part of the Fed's effort to bring down inflation. The Fed also said it will continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet at the rate announced in May.  A run in bitcoin and positive sentiment in the broader market saw prices of major cryptocurrencies increase. Ether (ETH) rose 11%, Polkadot’s DOT added 15%, while Cardano’s ADA and XRP rose some 7%, data from CoinGecko show.  Still, some analysts remain skeptical about a sustained rally and said possible contagion risks from within the crypto industry, such as troubles at crypto lender Celsius and crypto fund Three Arrows Capital facing possible insolvency, could add to selling pressure.  “The 'don’t fight the Fed' mantra has never been more relevant and volatility is anything but a surprise on the days of the Federal Reserve policy announcements,” Mikkel Morch, executive director at crypto fund ARK36, said in an email. “It seems that last week’s CPI print and subsequent comments by the Fed members already spooked investors so much that by the time of the actual meeting, a 75 basis point rate hike was already largely priced in.”  “It now appears that we can expect the Bitcoin price to hold the $20K level. Likely, it will consolidate there for the foreseeable future and maybe even tag the $24,000 resistance unless there is more contagion risk from one of the troubled projects in the DeFi space,” Morch said.  Outside of majors, Tron’s TRX jumped as much as 27% as the TronDAO, a community-run effort for the future development of Tron, deployed over $220 million to buy the token in the open market to protect the ecosystem's stablecoin, USDD.  Other notable gainers were Uniswap’s UNI token with a 16% gain and the token of layer 1 protocol Elrond (EGLD) rising 21%.

TronDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that oversees development on Tron, said in a Wednesday tweet that it sent over $120 million worth of USD coin (USDC) to Binance to “purchase TRX,” creating buying pressure among traders. The DAO later sent another $100 million for the TRX purchase, it said in a separate tweet.  TRX rose to over 6 cents in Asian morning hours before a brief sell-off at the time of writing. The token was trading at 4 cents in European hours Wednesday. Futures tracking the token saw some $8 million in liquidations, one of the highest among major cryptocurrencies.  Additional demand for TRX likely came as traders tried to bring USDD back to its peg amid a broader market run that saw bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rise over 6.3% and 11% in the past 24 hours.  USDD fell to as low as 91 cents this week amid contagion risks in the crypto market and weak macroeconomic sentiment. USDD is an algorithmic stablecoin on Tron and relies on an automated balancing mechanism that involves minting, or burning, of $1 worth of TRX to create 1 USDD.  Earlier this week, Tron founder Justin Sun deployed over $2 billion as traders seemed to short TRX. Funding rates – or the interest paid by traders to borrow capital for a trade – to short, or bet against, TRX futures reached a whopping 500%. Sun said the capital was intended to “fight them.”  TronDAO said in a tweet Tuesday that it added $650 million of USDC to its reserve to “safeguard the overall blockchain industry and crypto market.”  TronDAO seems committed to protecting USDD’s peg to seemingly avoid a repeat of the implosion of Terra stablecoin terraUSD (UST). It received some $500 million in USDC Tuesday to “defend #USDD peg” amid “current extreme market conditions,” per a tweet.",POSITIVE,TRX | USDC | USDD,MARKET | TRADING | TRX | USDC | USDD,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/16/trons-trx-bumps-27-as-dao-deploys-220m-for-token-purchase,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

At the time of writing, there are over 13,000 digital assets with a total market cap of $1.3T. Penetrating this market requires users to adopt long/short-term trading strategies. Long-term crypto investors (hodlers) represent users who take part in holding their digital coins. Essentially, hodlers believe that a certain cryptocurrency could become more valuable in the future. On the other hand, day traders work differently since they buy/sell cryptocurrencies daily. In that regard, the following article aims to highlight the ROI of both strategies to crypto investors. ROI Definition Return on Investment, commonly known as ROI, is a term that describes the profitability ratio of an asset. In the context of cryptocurrencies, ROI compares the purchasing cost of a digital currency with its returns. Users can determine the ROI of their investments once they adopt long/short-term trading strategies. Generally, a lower ROI means that profits are lower than the initial investment, while a higher ROI signifies rewarding the crypto investment. The ROI of Day Traders As mentioned above, day trading involves a day-to-day exercise of exchanging digital currencies. Here, investors mainly trade at different intervals.

29561,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=238451,1655343048,Why Cryptocurrencies Are a Bad Choice for Criminals and Money Launderers,"Early on, blockchain was known for its alleged anonymity. It proved impossible to attack the Bitcoin network, even with the most advanced quantum supercomputers yet to be developed. SHA-256 hash encryption made money untraceable, incorruptible, and impenetrable. This notion of impregnable anonymity originated with bitcoin but quickly spread to other cryptocurrencies. This, in turn, stirred the notion that cryptocurrencies are a safe haven for illicit activities, criminals, money launderers, and all other bad actors. However, the truth concerning anonymity, like so many other aspects of crypto, is a little more complicated. Pseudonymous Vs. Anonymous An anonymous individual can function or communicate in ways that make them unidentifiable. A pseudonym user can be identified, but their identity is hidden. People can post anonymously in a website&apos;s comments section without logging in. It&apos;s anonymous. The Rock, whose real name is Dwyane Johnson, is an example of a pseudonym, as is any other professional who uses a stage name. Although many cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin (BTC), are more traceable than cash transactions, others, including Zcash (ZEC), Monero (XMR), Grin (GRIN), and Beam (BEAM), were designed with anonymity and privacy in mind.

The interest in metaverse real estate signals the expectation that the virtual space will be valuable for the long term haul. The equally exaggerated view of NFTs is another pointer that investors are warning about. However, investment analysts have different opinions about what to expect from NFTs and metaverses due to their visible characteristics. The following are some diverse opinions on NFTs: Kraken Crypto Investment Analysts Predict NFTs will Lose Value The analysts from Kraken do not expect to see a sustainable market demand for NFTs as time passes. The high market capitalization of the digital assets is due to the overrated value of the items. As things settle down, the investors will become aware of the fact and lose interest in NFT platform trading. The reduced demand will see the assets lose value and cause the market cap to fall. The conclusions come from an intense analysis of the market movement over the past months, where a downward trend is evident. According to their findings, the market cap of the NFT market in September 2021 was at its peak while it stands at half of the value today.

Insights: Huobi Group's chief financial officer attributed the recent crypto crash to lending platform Celsius' announcement that it would pause withdrawals.

Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $22,710 +3.6%  Ether (ETH): $1,246 +4%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Solana SOL +20.0% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +17.2% Smart Contract Platform Polkadot DOT +15.5% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin Wobbles but Regains Its Balance  The Fed decreed interest rates will rise again.  Bitcoin cowered at first, then shrugged and climbed.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently moved past $22,700, a 3.6% jump from where it stood 24 hours earlier. Upon hearing the widely expected news Wednesday morning that the U.S. central bank would hike rates by the highest increment in more than a quarter-century – three-quarters of a percentage point – bitcoin fell toward $20,000. The price recovered shortly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made his announcement.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, also dropped first before rising about 4% from Tuesday to cross $1,200. Other major altcoins were in the green with SOL up 20% at one point, and UNI and DOT each rising over 15%. The increases recovered some of the massive amounts of ground that major cryptos lost over the past six days following first a surprising poor Consumer Price Index showing untamed inflation and then crypto lending platform Celsius' decision to halt withdrawals.  The fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD as it's known in the industry) has taken hold over crypto markets, moving from one party (and what it signifies within the ecosystem) to the next,"" Elementus CEO Max Galka wrote to CoinDesk. ""Today it is Celsius, tomorrow it will likely be another entity. When this cycle starts, exotic assets like cryptocurrencies are the first to be sold among institutional investors, and we will all know where the road ends.""  Crypto prices dovetailed with stocks' gains on Wednesday with the tech heavy Nasdaq rising 2.5% to reverse some of its steep losses from earlier in the week. The S&P 500, which hit bear market territory on Tuesday, meaning that it fell at least 20% from its previous high, gained 1.4% to break a five-day losing streak as investors reacted positively to the Fed's strong inflationary medicine and indications that it would continue its monetary hawkishness. Gold, a traditional safe haven that had dropped in previous days, increased 1.2%.  Powell said that last week's inflation surprise warranted “strong action at this meeting” rather than waiting another six weeks for the next gathering. “We decided we needed to go ahead, and so we did,” Powell said. “We came to the view that we’d like to do a little more front-end loading on that.""  He noted that ""either a 50-basis-point or a 75-basis-point increase seems most likely at our next meeting.”  Inflation played prominently on the minds of European financial leaders as well earlier Wednesday as the European Central Bank called an unscheduled meeting to consider wider market issues, including rising borrowing costs among indebted countries on the continent.  Meanwhile, the crypto industry continued to reckon with fallout from Celsius and the collapse last month of the terraUSD stablecoin (UST) and LUNA token that supported it. Bitcoin was trading near $40,000 prior to UST losing its dollar peg in early May, and the dual debacles have undermined crypto investor confidence. Elementus' Galka noted similarities in the current environment to the 2008 financial crisis when equity markets plummeted.  ""The current market conditions surrounding Terra and Celsius, and what both parties represent purely as psychological catalysts, do appear to have the makings of another 2008 crash,"" Galka wrote. ""There are important differentiators for sure: Terra USD was a flawed protocol vulnerable to attack, while the houses sold in 2008 dropped in fundamental value. In both cases, however, widespread fear was the primary motivator, introduced by the possibility of risk becoming a reality.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,789 +1.4%  DJIA: 30,668 +1%  Nasdaq: 11,099 +2.5%  Gold: $1,834 +1.2%  Insights  Celsius Triggered the Latest Crypto Crash  Bitcoin extended its losing streak to a record nine days and neared the $20,000 level after Asian markets closed. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 30% decline over the past week.  Risk-averse traders continue to shy away from bitcoin amid macroeconomic concerns such as rising inflation and contagion risks from within the crypto market.  Some, like Lily Zhang, the chief financial officer of Huobi Group, attributed bitcoin’s fall this week to troubles at prominent crypto lender Celsius, plus weak global markets. Huobi is one of the most popular exchanges in the Asian market and trades billions of dollars daily.  “We believe that the immediate trigger for the crypto crash appears to be a massive sell-off by investors amid the pausing of withdrawal services by crypto lending firm Celsius,” Zhang told CoinDesk in an email, adding the development came as crypto traders were just recovering from the implosion of Terra last month.  Celsius offered its users yields of up to 17% on deposits – an attractive amount for users looking to enter the crypto market and earn on idle capital. The firm used several strategies to garner returns, such as investing in liquidity pools on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.  Such strategies worked … until they didn’t. Poor market dynamics caused prices of staked ether (stETH), a popular ether derivative product used by the likes of Celsius, to stray away from prices of spot ether (ETH) and sent investing strategies akilter.  The contagion risk affected many prominent crypto players, with Celsius pausing all user withdrawals this week and notable crypto fund Three Arrows Capital seeing at least $400 million in losses due to liquidations.  Contagion risks on top of macroeconomic concerns could have led to outflows. As per a note this week from crypto firm CoinShares, investors have withdrawn over $102 million from cryptocurrencies last week amid expectations of a tightening of monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Meanwhile, Huobi’s Zhang says the market could see further declines as more liquidations occur and players are forced to sell.  “In the short term, the market will remain in a precarious position, and we should prepare for more liquidations which will increase the downward trend we are already seeing on stETH,” Zhang said.  Zhang, however, added that prices could see a recovery after short-term volatility subsides: “On an optimistic note, as the selling pressure on stETH continues to increase, more demand will seep into the second-hand markets and create cheaper stETH prices that may be attractive to new investors, which will in-turn increase demand and drive prices back up to normal.”  Sentiment among other crypto traders remains mixed. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes fears the market has not yet hit rock bottom, and we could see a massive sell-off in cryptocurrencies if bitcoin falls below $20,000. Elsewhere, Galaxy Digital head Mike Novogratz said in a tweet that bitcoin is close to the “bottom” and will hold above $20,000.  As for the Celsius troubles, some say users are better off custodying their own assets than depending on a third party. One executive who has witnessed several crypto winters, said that markets can decline quickly and scarily, but they’re not indefinite.  “Self-custody is what crypto was built for, and what we are seeing right now is not unusual,” explained Brian Norton, chief operating officer of MyEtherWallet, in an email to CoinDesk. “These sorts of occurrences illustrate the need and benefits of self-custody, and provide time and opportunity for people to learn how it is done.  “I think every time you see this, it just reinforces the point that if you are relying exclusively on centralized platforms, even when the yields are great, you’re still giving up a good deal of control over your digital assets,” Norton added.  Technician's take  Crypto Winter Is Here. The Weak Will Die, and the Strong Will Eat Their Bones  Let visions of Consensus carry you through the bear market.  It has been a week of whiplash for us here at CoinDesk. On the one hand, we just scored an immense triumph as an organization with Consensus 2022, which wrapped up on Sunday. The conference was a sprawling, frenetic four days that proved how intense and broad the interest in crypto is. It also, if I can pat my fellow CoinDeskers on the back, proved once and for all that we are the media organization at the center of it all.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  On the other hand, of course, in the mere two days since Consensus ended, we’ve seen an incredible rout in crypto markets, with bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) both dropping roughly 20% in two days.  There are now signs of a liquidity crunch, and maybe even insolvency, at the centralized lending platform Celsius Network ­– arguably the “other shoe” dropping after the LUNA/UST unwind. Trouble at Celsius, in turn, seems to have traders worried about stETH, an important bond-like token related to the Ethereum Merge. There are similar, seeming liquidity issues at Three Arrows Capital and, to top it all off, crypto exchange Coinbase just laid off 1,100 people.  There is so much to say about this moment, and we here at CoinDesk will be saying all of it in the coming weeks and months as we help you navigate the crypto crisis. But before the dominos started toppling at scale, I was planning for this column to be about the amazingness of Consensus. And I still think that’s important, because the vision and passion that was on display at Consensus in Austin, Texas, last weekend is exactly how we find our way out of this mess.  A big tent  Above all, Consensus was a big tent. Huge, in fact, literally and figuratively. We drew 17,000 attendees to the conference itself, and another 3,000 attended satellite events. It was the South by Southwest of crypto, complete with concerts from Disclosure and Big Boi. And it will be next year, in Austin, too.  More to the point, though, the breadth of programming and perspectives was mind-boggling. For instance, I was on my way to moderate a panel and had a few moments to spare, and so I stuck my head in a random auditorium – and there was Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has little crypto involvement aside from a shared concern about data harvesting.  I got to see sci-fi author Neal Stephenson and technologist Jaron Lanier in conversation with CoinDesk contributor Leah Callon-Butler. I myself got to interview one of the Baylor University bitcoin researchers, and also had a delightfully unhinged conversation with Chris Gabriel, aka MemeAnalysis, about memetics, Freud, black magic and the CIA.

A Schelling point is, very loosely, a symbol, site, technology or other focal point that draws people together to collaborate without explicit communication or coordination. Crypto has seized society’s imagination and become a site for transformative change – even if we’re not clear where it’s headed.  Crashdown?  And here we get to the market crash. I feel immense empathy for those who are losing their jobs right now and for those who will in the coming days and weeks. I’ve been there – I lost my job as a result of the 2018 crypto crash.  But there are also immense positives to a crypto downturn. The products failing – particularly luna and Celsius – were substantially illusory all along, driven by inflated, unsustainable returns. It’s now becoming clear that the “profits” depositors in these systems received were essentially a game of musical chairs using venture capital money.  Coinbase, meanwhile, has admitted that it made a major strategic mistake by hiring too fast despite, as I pointed out when it went public in 2021, the brutally cyclical nature of the exchange business. And Three Arrows, a highly influential venture firm, appears to have been heavily invested in some of the most speculative and risky projects on the market.  I know it’s a terrible cliché, but it’s nonetheless true: All of that is, in fact, the good news.  Back at it  While we’ll certainly see more unwinds, withdrawal freezes and mysterious silences over the next few weeks or even months, the market crash will be hardest on companies and investors who have made poor decisions. As crypto expanded and hype built over the past two years, fundamentally worthless projects proliferated, minting their own ephemeral tokens and convincing uninformed retail traders and high-profile veteran hedge fund managers alike that they had value.  This sort of garbage has crept into crypto during every expansion cycle. The current downturn is the holy cleansing flame that will eliminate it, in the same way that an old-growth forest needs a good fire every once in a while to renew itself. Getting rid of fake trash built on hype and a cult of personality means that, while there may be less money sloshing around for the next year or so, a much higher proportion of that will go to credible projects.  Capital is available  Those who are looking to build something based on a solid idea will thrive in this environment – especially because, unlike in 2018, it seems likely there will still be substantial venture capital available. As an example, consider that OpenSea, which generated $20 billion in NFT sales in 2021, was founded in 2017, with a lot of building through 2018 and 2019. That was not just during a fallow period for crypto, it was before most people had heard the term non-fungible token.  See also: 6 Reasons for Optimism This Crypto Winter | Opinion  There will be other OpenSeas, other Ethereum Name Services (ENS), other genuinely useful and profitable services or technologies developed during the coming bear market (OK, I’m ready to call it a crypto winter now). The best way to survive, or thrive, will be to do that building and position yourself to reap the benefits during the next big surge.  And remember that these downturns are always shorter than they seem. Personally, after losing my crypto job in 2018 it was less than two years before I was back in the industry – and having even more fun than before.
