Arkham Intelligence, on the on-chain analytics data on Dec. 06, has found the wallet that is connected to the UK government that holds 61.245k Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth $6 billion. This wallet has also gained profit from the Bitcoin price movement, with more than $28 million in unrealised profit. It is stated by Arkham that the Bitcoin owned by the UK government is a seized asset from Zhimin Qian, a fraudster with a multi-billion pound scam. “The UK government now holds $6 billion USD of Bitcoin. They have been holding this for 3.5 Years after its seizure from Zhimin Qian in 2021,” Arkham stated on X post Although the last time this wallet was actively used was 3 months ago, the seized Bitcoin that they received only happened 3 years ago. The first time, they received 2,400 Bitcoins worth $93 million, and they got the same amount at a different transaction. In the last one, they received 19.200 Bitcoin worth $750 million.

While Jian has already been sentenced to 6 years in prison due to the money laundering plot, Zhimin will face the trial in September next year at Southwark Crown Court, where a co-defendant, Seng Hok Ling, has also pleaded not guilty to related charges.

37267815,https://thecoinrise.com/robinhood-ceo-comments-on-bitcoin-and-new-sec-chair-pick/,1733441455,Robinhood CEO Comments on Bitcoin and New SEC Chair Pick,"The Bitcoin ascent beyond the $100,000 mark has set the financial world abuzz. This bullish trajectory signals a seismic shift in its journey from niche digital currency to a global financial asset. During an interview, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev offered insights into the asset’s historic rally and implications. He weighed in on regulatory shifts and leadership changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin Surge to $103,900: What’s Driving It? Bitcoin crossed $103,900 for the first time, fueled by strong institutional interest and regulatory changes. Tenev highlighted how Bitcoin’s perception has shifted from being dismissed to being taken seriously. This notion was further supported by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who recently compared Bitcoin to gold. Powell positioned Bitcoin as a speculative asset that competes with gold, not the dollar. This reassured crypto supporters, affirming Bitcoin’s status as a store of value. Tenev also mentioned the growing idea of Bitcoin being used as a reserve asset, similar to gold in national reserves. Many see its limited supply and decentralized nature as valuable for wealth protection. Institutional investors and governments increasingly view Bitcoin as a long-term wealth safeguard. As Bitcoin’s value soared, Robinhood became a major player in facilitating crypto transactions. The platform processed over $30 billion in crypto trades in November, a 400% increase from the previous month. This surge highlights growing retail investor interest, with Robinhood’s services making crypto more accessible. Tenev stressed that regulatory clarity is key to maintaining this momentum. Paul Atkins’ Nomination Brings Hope for Crypto-Friendly Regulation The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair has stirred optimism within the crypto industry. Known for his pro-business stance, Atkins is expected to bring a more balanced approach to crypto regulation. Tenev contrasted this with the current administration’s regulatory framework, which he described as hostile to crypto. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also supported Atkins’ nomination. Garlinghouse expressed hope that his leadership would prioritize clear guidelines over harsh enforcement. Tenev argued that supportive policies could drive innovation and stability for crypto firms, contrasting with Gary Gensler ’s more cautious regulatory approach. Clearer regulations, he believes, would boost confidence and growth in the crypto market. The Road Ahead: A Bullish Outlook Financial experts believe that Bitcoin’s price could reach $120,000 by the end of the year if current trends persist. This optimism is fueled by continued institutional adoption, regulatory changes, and a growing consensus that Bitcoin is here to stay . As Bitcoin cements its place as digital gold, discussions on its regulation and adoption will shape the financial future. With industry leaders driving innovation and policymakers like Atkins offering support, crypto assets’s future looks bright.

Monero (XMR) just hit a two-year high of $211, fuelled by growing interest in privacy coins. At the same time, Immutable X (IMX) has taken the Web3 gaming world by storm with its $1 million player rewards initiative alongside Yield Guild Games (YGG). But the crown jewel of short-term crypto plays might just be Qubetics ($TICS) . Its presale is smashing records, with $4.4 million already raised and projections of insane ROI that have investors buzzing. What makes Qubetics so exciting isn’t just the numbers; it’s the innovation. The project’s Multi-Chain Wallet aims to solve real-world headaches for users, from freelancers needing quick cross-border payments to businesses managing assets across multiple blockchains. This is more than hype—it’s crypto stepping up to meet the demands of the modern world. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Wallet Revolutionises Asset Management Qubetics is taking the crypto world by storm, and for good reason. Currently in the 11th stage of its presale, it has sold over 270 million tokens to more than 6,500 holders, raising a whopping $4.4 million. At just $0.0282 per token, this is an opportunity that screams potential. But you’ll need to act fast—the price is set to climb by 10% this weekend when the 12th stage begins. The standout feature of Qubetics is its Multi-Chain Wallet , a tool that’s set to revolutionise how we manage digital assets. Imagine being a freelancer working with clients in different countries, each paying you in a different cryptocurrency. Normally, you’d spend hours juggling wallets and calculating conversion fees. Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet simplifies all of this, consolidating your assets in one secure place and automating conversions at competitive rates. Click here to learn more about how Qubetics makes cross-border payments as easy as a walk in the park with its multi-chain wallet. For businesses, the potential is just as massive. Picture an e-commerce store accepting payments in multiple cryptos or a logistics company managing supply chain payments across different blockchains. The Multi-Chain Wallet eliminates the hassle, offering a seamless experience that saves time and money. And then there are the numbers. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, a staggering 783% ROI. Post-presale, $TICS is expected to climb to $1, delivering 3,434% returns. If it reaches $15 after its mainnet launch, you’re looking at an unbelievable 52,912% ROI. Let’s break it down. A $12,500 investment at today’s price of $0.0282 could grow to $111,066 by the presale’s end. If $TICS hits $1, your $12.5K turns into $442,335. And if it rockets to $15? You’d be sitting on a jaw-dropping $6.63 million. That’s not just a win; it’s a game-changer . Monero (XMR): Privacy Coins Make a Comeback Monero is back in the spotlight, hitting a two-year high of $211 before settling at $205.05. Privacy coins as a category have surged over 12% in just 24 hours, with Monero leading the charge. What’s behind the buzz? A landmark U.S. court ruling on Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts has reignited interest in privacy-centric cryptos. Monero’s appeal lies in its ability to shield transaction details, offering a level of anonymity akin to physical cash. For advocates, this isn’t just a feature; it’s a necessity in a world where financial privacy is increasingly under threat. Critics, of course, argue that privacy coins are magnets for illicit activity, but Monero has held its ground, even as regulatory scrutiny ramps up. The surge in Monero’s price also reflects broader market interest in privacy coins, with other tokens like Haven, Verge, and Zcash posting impressive weekly gains. As the debate over financial privacy heats up, Monero’s resilience makes it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , especially for those betting on continued market momentum. Immutable X (IMX): Redefining Web3 Gaming Immutable X is making waves in the gaming industry, partnering with Yield Guild Games (YGG) to allocate $1 million towards player rewards. This isn’t just a feel-good initiative; it’s a strategic move to dominate the Web3 gaming landscape. The partnership aims to create new earning opportunities for players and developers while expanding the ecosystem with Immutable’s cutting-edge Passport wallet and zkEVM scaling solution. Why does this matter for short-term investors? The gaming industry is massive, and Immutable X is positioning itself as the go-to platform for Web3 developers. Its sponsorship of YGG’s Play Summit and the GAM3 Awards in Manila underscores its commitment to fostering a community-driven gaming experience. As the hype around Web3 gaming grows, so does the potential for IMX to see significant price appreciation. IMX isn’t just about gaming; it’s about creating a sustainable ecosystem that benefits everyone involved. Whether you’re a gamer earning rewards or a developer building the next hit game, Immutable X offers a platform that’s both scalable and user-friendly. For short-term investors, the buzz around IMX and its increasing adoption in the gaming sector make it one of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term . As more developers and players flock to its platform, the likelihood of a price spike grows, making now the perfect time to get in on the action. The Final Word: Top Short-Term Crypto Picks for 2024 When it comes to the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term , Qubetics, Monero, and Immutable X stand out for their unique strengths and growth potential. Qubetics offers unparalleled ROI projections and game-changing tools like the Multi-Chain Wallet. Monero is riding the wave of renewed interest in privacy coins, while Immutable X is set to redefine gaming with its innovative approach to Web3. The clock’s ticking, though. The Qubetics presale price won’t stay this low for long, and the momentum behind Monero and IMX could lead to quick price spikes. Don’t sit this one out—take action now and position yourself for short-term gains that could make a lasting impact.

37267565,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=657835,1733441417,"Bitcoin Price At $100,000: Road To More Gains Or Potential Bull Trap? Analyst Has Answers","The Bitcoin price has soared above $100,000 for the first time ever, sparking optimism among market participants. In line with this development, crypto analyst Xanrox has provided insights into whether more gains lie ahead for Bitcoin or whether this rally above $100,000 could be a potential bull trap. What Next For Bitcoin Price Following Rally To $100,000 In a recent TradingView post, Xanrox suggested that the Bitcoin price will unlikely enjoy a sustained rally for now. He explained that this is unlikely because a sustained rally could easily put Bitcoin at $600,000 by December 2025, which is impossible. As such, he believes that BTC would need to slow down. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Continues Trading Sideways But Bullish Pennant Says Get Ready For $1.30 The analyst further noted that the Bitcoin price hasn’t made any bigger correction in the past weeks, which is one reason why he is not looking to buy BTC anytime soon. Xanrox remarked that the market needs to see a shakeout and a flash crash first before anything else. He suggested that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $85,000 when this correction finally happens. Xanrox stated that the $85,000 level is a very reasonable support because it is the end of the massive FVG (fair value gap) on the daily candles. He added that this target is also the start of the first price action on the volume profile. The crypto analyst revealed that this is the level at which he is looking to buy Bitcoin. The crypto analyst indicated that this Bitcoin price rally to $100,000 is a bull trap, as he highlighted a symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart. He said this looks like a bull trap for retail traders because everyone would buy the breakout. As such, he envisages that Bitcoin would make a last push to sweep liquidity. A Major Correction Might Not Come Anytime Soon On the other hand, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has offered a diverging opinion, suggesting that a major correction might not come anytime soon for the Bitcoin price. In his recent X post, he alluded to a previous post in which he stated that the current bullish cycle is very similar to the ones in 2017 and 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100,000: Why Reclaiming The $96,400 Level Is Very Important For Another Rally If this pattern holds true, Martinez predicts that the Bitcoin price won’t suffer its first major correction of between 15% to 30% until its hits $135,000 or even $159,000. Meanwhile, the accompanying chart put the market top for Bitcoin at $240,000, indicating that it will still have more room to move the upside even after this correction. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $102,800, up over 6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

37269270,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316814,1733441400,"Ditch Restrictive Crypto Exchange Regulations, Urges Argentinian Bitcoin NGO","Crypto exchange regulations are “distorting” and rendering the Argentinian sector “inefficient,” an influential Bitcoin -promoting NGO has claimed. Bitcoin Argentina, one of the nation’s top pro-crypto pressure groups, made its claims in an official statement published on December 4. The NGO claimed that the National Securities Commission (CNV)’s move to force all crypto exchanges in the company to register and share client data runs counter to the policies of the “libertarian” President Javier Milei. Crypto Exchange Regulations Hurt Argentina’s Cause, NGO Claims Earlier this year, the CNV began policing exchanges for the first time, requiring them to adhere to the kind of regulations now commonplace in Western Europe, North America, Japan, and South Korea. However, Bitcoin Argentina said that the CNV’s new registry system is bringing “distortions and inefficiencies” to the crypto sector. President Javier Milei’s approval rating recovered last month as the economy showed signs of recovery and inflation cooled to its lowest point in nearly three years. https://t.co/H5y3uO7JyP — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) December 4, 2024 The NGO said the regulator should scrap its policies and “limit its scope” to fighting “money laundering.” The CNV has committed itself to creating the registry, with all “digital asset service providers (PSAVs)” obliged to apply for operating permits. However, the NGO claims that the regulator is trying to fix non-existent issues “in a sector that currently operates without problems.” La Nina could thwart Argentina's run at bumper crops https://t.co/sqW2JQQhLa pic.twitter.com/yENcfcXaTE — Reuters (@Reuters) December 5, 2024 “The current system is not a far-off, uncertain, or new market. It is not a sector in crisis or emergency. It is an existing one. And it works well. While the new rules will benefit some players in the ecosystem, they will stifle the growth of others. And it will do nothing to prevent the emergence of future scams.” Bitcoin Argentina And Bitcoin Argentina went a step further, claiming that the rules also “pose a risk for the CNV itself” and for crypto traders in the country. The NGO explained that this was due to the fact that it fails to “provide greater security tools” and “will even create a false sense of security and supervision.” Essentially granting firms the CNV “seal of approval” in “a market that is eminently risky, asymmetric, global, and unmanageable” would be a major risk, it said. “Argentina has a unique opportunity to commit to deregulation and maintain the freedom that has yielded such good results so far. We could model that for the rest of the world.” Ricardo Mihura, Bitcoin Argentina President ‘A Burden for Smaller Businesses’ The NGO’s President Ricardo Mihura said he “cannot understand how the CNV” had chosen to “deviate from the government’s deregulatory approach and propose an inefficient regulatory burden.” The NGO also warned of “immediate consequences” for “small businesses and self-employed workers,” who would be “forced out of the sector or dragged into illegality.” “Regulatory costs” could also cripple “new” Argentinian crypto projects in the future, Mihura noted.

IMF Role? Most think the CNV’s crypto exchange regulations were intended as a gesture of good faith to the Intentional Monetary Fund, which has previously expressed concerns about the nation’s lack of crypto regulation.

And the CNV has also held several BTC adoption-themed meetings with its counterparts in El Salvador. It has also hinted at its softening stance on crypto by attending local crypto summits .

Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37267469,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623543,1733440830,EOS Network Foundation partners with Binance’s Ceffu to advance CeDeFi and strengthen asset security,"EOS Network Foundation (ENF) announced its partnership with Ceffu in one of the most exciting crypto links. Ceffu is an institutional partner of Binance, and this arrangement will support the EOS mainnet. The partnership will be critical in unlocking the new CeDeFi opportunities for EOS token holders while providing institutional-grade custodian services. Ceffu’s advanced custody infrastructure guarantees the institution’s safety on its EOS assets. Relying on multi-party computation and customized approval schemes highlights how seriously the firm has taken security matters. The arrangement will allow institutional fund handlers to use CeDeFi strategies that grasp the best of CEX and DeFi ecosystems. Through Binance liquidity and robust trading styles, EOS token holders can access the innovative yield solution tailored to institutional needs. With this partnership, though, there is a growing focus on institutional solutions. EOS seems to alienate retail holders and small-scale entities, so this partnership may bring very few benefits to small-scale blockchain users. EOS remains one of the top blockchain platforms With EOS featured on the Coinbase COIN50 index , its popularity and interest are growing among institutions. This recognition shows that EOS is among the leading blockchain platforms and an integral player in the crypto ecosystem. According to Yves La Rose, Founder & CEO of EOS Network Foundation, Ceffu’s integration with EOS represents an important step in building the infrastructure necessary to support institutional engagement at scale. He added that by partnering with Ceffu, they are creating new pathways for institutions to participate securely in the EOS ecosystem and benefit from its evolving opportunities. The EOS network is significant in this partnership. The third-generation blockchain that operates on the EOS virtual machine is set for high-speed and low-cost transactions. The design supports seamless Web3 for all players, developers, and users alike. Even though the partnership looks good, Ceffu’s ties with Binance might be a regulatory risk. Binance is sustainedly scrutinized in several jurisdictions. High innovations with strategic tokenomics build the EOS ecosystem Due to approved community tokenomics, EOS has seen regular growth, enhanced by performance improvements. One of its new tokenomics strategies is committing a funding portfolio for middleware with the executed Unicove doorway beaming the new entrance process and enhancing user experience. Also, a staking rewards plan distributes $450 worth of EOS. The plan, which has been in motion for more than five months, has led to more people taking EOS while extending the token lock-up time to almost one month. These simple yet strategic tokenomics are the cornerstone that strengthens the EOS ecosystem. They show how versatile, robust, and appealing the system is. Most EOS token holders see the partnership between EOS and Ceffu as a step in the right direction. It would guarantee the security of assets across various networks.

Yesterday, Coinbase announced the listing of Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), a Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin. “Moo Deng (MOODENG) is now live on http://coinbase.com & in the Coinbase iOS & Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.” Moo Deng is the name of a baby pygmy hippopotamus born in the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Si Racha, Chonburi, Thailand, this past summer. The hippo has become an internet sensation, inspiring memes and memecoins alike. Moo Deng means “bouncy pork” in Thai. Our favorite bouncy pork a.k.a Moo Deng ?? #moodeng @KhaokheowZoo @MooDengSOL pic.twitter.com/5cJl9oJD82 — Moo Deng (@moodengx) December 1, 2024 In November, Moo Deng went viral again by correctly “ predicting ” the outcome of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Despite Moo Deng’s internet fame, MOODENG has faltered in the hours following the Coinbase listing. Approximately 24 hours following the memecoin’s addition to Coinbase, MOODENG is down 12.4%. Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto markets are largely surging following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) historic breakthrough of $100,000. In stark contrast with MOODENG’s struggles, another Solana-based memecoin ripped after Coinbase added support on Wednesday. Gigachad ( GIGA ), a crypto asset inspired by the photo shoot of Russian bodybuilder Ernest Khalimov, pumped up 51% after the top US crypto exchange listed the memecoin.

On Dec. 5, Bitcoin (BTC) broke the psychological $100,000 barrier, just weeks after surpassing the $90,000 mark on Nov. 12, as reported by TradingView. Shortly after, Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $104,000 at 3:08 a.m. UTC, roughly 90 minutes after breaking the $100,000 threshold. The surge was fueled by over $31 billion in net inflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a tightened supply due to Bitcoin’s fourth halving in April. Donald Trump’s Victory Boosts Bitcoin Rally Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election contributed to Bitcoin’s momentum, alongside speculation of a strategic Bitcoin national reserve and increased corporate adoption led by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. Additionally, Trump’s Dec. 4 nomination of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC chair has sparked optimism. This move could eliminate regulatory barriers that have hindered the crypto sector under the Biden administration. Trump’s pro-crypto cabinet includes Scott Bessent and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as nominees for Secretary of Treasury and Commerce, respectively, potentially creating the most crypto-friendly administration to date. Bitcoin Up 126% in 2024 Bitcoin’s value has increased by 126% since Jan. 1, when it traded at $44,000. Its market capitalization has now reached a record $2 trillion for the first time. While Bitcoin’s 2024 rally is impressive, it isn’t its most dramatic. In 2017, Bitcoin soared 1,900%, rising from $1,000 in January to $20,000 in December.

37266872,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317336,1733438874,$GME Trading Halted as Roaring Kitty’s Post Shakes the Market,"GameStop Corp. ($GME) shares experienced a massive boost on Thursday after a cryptic post by Keith Gill, the influential figure behind the 2021 “meme stock” frenzy. The post immediately reignited investor interest, causing GameStop’s shares to spike and the Roaring Kitty meme to pump. Roaring Kitty’s Cryptic Post Sends $GME Stock Soaring 15% – What’s His Next Move? Keith Gill, famously known as “Roaring Kitty,” has once again stirred up the markets with a cryptic post on social media platform X . Gill, a key figure in GameStop’s 2021 retail trading frenzy, shared an image of a Time magazine cover featuring a computer with an old video player. pic.twitter.com/tXViICmVFG — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) December 5, 2024 Known online as “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube and “DeepF***ingValue” on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, Gill posted an image of a Time magazine cover with a computer screen on the social media platform X. The post triggered a 15% spike in GameStop’s stock price, leading to trading halts on platforms like Robinhood due to heightened volatility. The ripple effect extended to the digital asset market, where a GameStop-inspired meme coin on the Solana blockchain skyrocketed by 65%. Gill, a former financial adviser from Massachusetts, initially gained fame in 2021 by championing GameStop as a retail investor opportunity. This sparked a retail trading frenzy that sent the stock soaring over 10,000% at its peak. Roaring Kitty Returns: Keith Gill Sparks Market Chaos After Three-Year Silence Gill’s recent social media activity comes after a three-year hiatus, during which his followers eagerly awaited his return. Many see him as a symbol of retail investors’ triumph over Wall Street, likening him to a modern David against Goliath. The GameStop trading frenzy of 2021, sparked by Gill’s bullish posts, extended to other heavily shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment. The collective effort by Reddit users to squeeze hedge funds resulted in billions of dollars in losses for institutional investors and drew the attention of regulators. The dramatic events of the Reddit rally were later dramatized in Craig Gillespie’s 2023 film Dumb Money. The 2021 rally also raised questions about market fairness, particularly after trading restrictions were imposed on retail investors. These measures drew allegations of manipulation, as hedge funds held large short positions in GameStop during the peak of the trading frenzy. By Thursday afternoon, trading activity around GameStop had intensified, with about 300,000 options contracts changing hands—approximately 1.5 times the usual trading volume, according to a Reuters report . The stock’s 30-day implied volatility, a measure of expected short-term price movements, also jumped to 132%, marking a three-week high. Among the most popular trades were contracts betting that GameStop’s stock price would exceed $30 by the end of the week, with 32,000 such options traded by late afternoon. A Solana-based dog-themed memecoin, Chewy (CHWY), surged nearly 28% after the return of Roaring Kitty , famous for the GameStop short squeeze. Gill posted a cryptic image on X on September 6 , sparking speculation among traders. The post featured a Toy Story meme with the Chewy logo, which some interpreted as a signal that Gill might be stepping back from his role at Chewy. Despite no technical utility, meme coins like CHWY thrive on social sentiment, making Gill’s posts influential for traders.

Table of Contents Altstreet Bets bullish Dogecoin price target DTX Exchange presale enters phase six, price pumps 500% Expert Seth: Solana to $800 DOGE, DTX, SOL: The altcoin to stand out The crypto market continues to attract new investors, with Altstreet Bets, a famous expert, predicting Dogecoin (DOGE) may hit $0.70. At the same time, DTX Exchange (DTX) and Solana (SOL) have made it big, recording almost 550% price jumps combined. While SOL is one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies, DTX is a rookie in phase six of its presale. However, DTX’s recent CoinMarketCap listing and its potential to tap into the $133T bonds market have made experts very bullish on it. Some even hint at a potential 900% value surge for this altcoin in 2025. Altstreet Bets bullish Dogecoin price target Dogecoin is one of the best meme coins in the space, with its price increasing nearly 180% in the past 30 days. In other words, DOGE increased from $0.15 to $0.41 in a few weeks. Crypto analyst Altstreet Bets noted this performance and made a bold Dogecoin price target. In a recent X post, the analyst said this meme coin is ready to run again. His prediction suggests that DOGE may soon hit $0.70 at a wave five completion. The technical analysis of Dogecoin also shows bullish signs. The momentum indicator for this meme coin now sits at -0.012 in the buy zone, suggesting that this uptrend may continue. DTX Exchange presale enters phase six, price pumps 500% As one of the hottest presales in the market, the DTX Exchange is also in the sights of investors. Early buyers have already received a 500% return, and with the presale now in phase six, this percentage will continue rising. Its recent CoinMarketCap listing may bring countless new eyes to it. Many traders have faith in DTX Exchange’s long-term vision. The upcoming trading platform seeks to bring access to over 120k asset classes, including bonds, crypto coins, etc. This could be a perfect opportunity for traders to enter markets with ease. Not only that, DTX Exchange will not require any sign-up KYC checks, making traders anonymous. By holding the DTX token, users will get many perks, like governance voting rights and a percentage of the trading fee revenue. Currently, one DTX is worth $0.12, but phase seven will push this value to $0.14. Additionally, traders are awaiting a Tier-1 CEX listing for DTX, which may bring the price to $0.20, a 66% increase. You might also like: DOGE price up 170%, ADA and new altcoin surge over 700% Expert Seth: Solana to $800 Solana is another crypto currency making waves right now. On the one-month chart, the price of Solana increased from $163 to $236. This is nearly a 50% increase, which is quite a good performance. Technical data suggests that this movement may continue. Currently, Solana is valued above its 20-day EMA ($231) and its 50-day EMA ($208). Additionally, the altcoin has a bull-bear power indicator of 4.01 in the buy zone, suggesting that bulls are in control. Market expert Seth also made a bullish Solana price forecast. In an X post, he said that the Solana coin may surge to $800 or even $1,400. This is because Grayscale recently filed for a Solana ETF—a bullish development that will potentially increase demand for this crypto. DOGE, DTX, SOL: The altcoin to stand out Experts believe that DOGE, DTX, and SOL are all altcoins to watch since they could see big price gains soon. However, the DTX Exchange will have a smaller market cap than its peers. This could give it the competitive edge as DTX may need less money for its price to rise. As such, experts predict DTX could even soar by 900% in 2025. To learn more about DTX, visit their website or Telegram community .

Google Trends recently shows a sharp rise in global searches for altcoins, signaling renewed interest from investors. These search volumes are reaching levels last seen during the 2021 bull run, possibly marking the start of a new era for altcoins. This shift comes as Bitcoin (BTC) recently surpassed $100,000 , raising the possibility of capital moving from Bitcoin into altcoins. Google Trends and Altcoin Outlook Rotation In October, global search interest in altcoins reached a Google Trends score of 11, signaling a significant uptick in attention. Notably, the scale of the search volume indicates that altcoins are back in the spotlight. According to Google Trends graphs statistics, a rising trend means more traders actively seek information about these digital assets. Interestingly, some experts view the current spike as indicative of a true altcoin season. But what makes this surge particularly exciting is its alignment with Bitcoin’s breakout. When Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 threshold, it created a wave of speculation that the fund flowing into BTC might soon begin shifting into other assets. This is what many analysts call capital rotation, a process where investors move their funds from the market leader into alternative assets. Expert Predictions: Altcoins Gaining Ground Against Bitcoin While some might argue that the altcoin season is still in its infancy, key experts already highlighted certain altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. These tokens are gaining significant traction, signaling the strength of the altcoin market. Notably, tokens such as Fantom, Cardano (ADA) , and Filecoin (FIL) have shown impressive gains against BTC. In the past 30 days, Fantom has risen 47% against BTC, FIL has surged 64%, and ADA has outperformed Bitcoin by an incredible 144%. Recent reports show that 38 of the top 50 altcoins have surpassed Bitcoin’s performance. While this number has dipped slightly to 36, the overall trend remains strong. Analysts have historically viewed pullbacks like this as temporary as they do not detract from the broader narrative that altcoin season is well underway. This outperformance is a key marker of the altcoin season. Many analysts argue that it’s not just the performance of altcoins relative to the US Dollar that matters. Instead, their performance against Bitcoin is considered a more significant indicator of altcoin season. The Technical Picture: Strength in the Altcoin Market Beyond search data and expert predictions, technical indicators further confirm that altcoins are in a strong position. The TOTAL3 chart, which tracks the market cap of altcoins excluding Ethereum (ETH), has recently reached $1.08 trillion. Additionally, the Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) indicator, which tracks support and resistance, is positioned below the altcoin market value. This further suggests continued growth. However, Bitcoin’s price and potential BTC dominance could temporarily slow altcoin momentum.

The validators are eyeing the possibility of losing almost $500 million in revenue annually. Unsiwap has been the heartbeat of the Ethereum mainnet, and the shift will have huge consequences on the network. Justin Bons, the chief investment officer of Cyber Capital, cautioned against the migration of significant protocols, saying they could undermine Ethereum’s core narrative of being a deflationary currency. Currently, Uniswap’s universal router amounts to 14.5% of the gas fee on Ethereum, translating to $1.6 billion of Ethereum destroyed. The shift would affect the destruction mechanism, which is a core part of Ethereum’s deflationary model and would weaken Ethereum, stressing its economic logic. Uniswap’s departure weakens Ethereum’s economic resilience and threatens its network security Uniswap and other significant protocols exit come with high costs to Ethereum, even though its scaling solutions are meant to accommodate more significant transactions. The decline in Ethereum’s fee income will likely have far-reaching consequences, potentially weakening its ability to sustain robust network security. Having already endured a challenging year, Ethereum now faces an even greater obstacle with Uniswap’s departure. This move is more than a technical shift; it raises significant questions about the sustainability of Ethereum’s scaling strategy and poses a critical challenge to its economic and strategic stability. Uniswap’s Superchain initiative challenges Ethereum’s scalability strategy centered on Layer 2 solutions Uniswap’s decision to launch its own “Superchain” using Optimism’s Layer 2 superchain stack makes it more complex. Uniswap has pushed for greater autonomy, but this push has affected the broader blockchain ecosystem. Its choice to develop Unichain and allow users to deploy UNI apps directly on-chain is radical. Ethereum has always centered its scalability approach on Layer 2 solutions. The layer 2 protocols are known to process transactions off-chain while leveraging Ethereum’s mainet for security. Katalin Tischhauser, Head of Investment Research at Sygnum Bank, notes that while Layer 2s may initially reduce mainnet revenue, they are very likely to drive long-term growth. She argues that t he long-term view is that the NET effect will be growth for the Ethereum L1 because the cheap L2s can catalyze new types of transactions previously impossible.

37266253,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373535,1733437872,Tron’s TVL Reaches New Record of $36.2 Billion,"Amidst a broader market resurgence, the Tron blockchain has been seeing impressive strength. In fact, the total value locked (TVL) on the blockchain surged to $36.2 billion on December 4. This figure marked a new all-time high for the network, demonstrating growing appeal among decentralized finance (DeFi) users. The achievement reflects the increasing adoption of Tron’s infrastructure for DeFi applications, stablecoin transactions, and smart contract functionality. New Peak For TRX The latest development comes as Tron’s TRX token achieved a record-high price of $0.44 this week, breaking a seven-year streak and marking a major milestone for the network. Although it has since pulled back to $0.33, the token still stood at weekly gains of 66% as it finally reclaimed the 10th spot by market cap. Several factors are driving this rally, including speculation about TRX’s potential inclusion in Grayscale’s portfolio of investment assets. Grayscale previously announced TRX as one of 35 tokens being evaluated, with quarterly updates expected, fueling optimism for institutional support. Beyond this, Tron founder Justin Sun has also played a pivotal role in amplifying interest. Sun recently spent $30 million on WLFI tokens associated with Donald Trump’s initiative called ‘World Liberty Financial’ and even took on an advisory position. Moreover, his involvement with the conceptual artwork “Comedian” has spurred community engagement, with ripple effects boosting activity for related tokens like BAN. Stablecoin Ecosystem on Tron Network Meanwhile, Messari’s recent report revealed that the stablecoin market cap on Tron has seen a consistent upward trajectory over the past year, with Q3 maintaining that momentum. During the quarter, the market cap increased by 3% quarter-over-quarter, rising from $58.02 billion to $59.97 billion. This figure currently stands at a little over $60 billion, as per DeFiLlama. USDT continued to dominate the stablecoin landscape on Tron, holding a steady 98% market share. Other stablecoins also showed growth in Q3. USDD, the second-largest stablecoin on Tron, increased marginally by 0.11% quarter-over-quarter, from $729.9 million to $730.6 million. Notably, TUSD experienced the largest growth percentage-wise, surging by 87% quarter-over-quarter, from $89.1 million to $166.6 million. USDJ rounded out the top four, rising 4% during the same period, and concluded Q3 with $70.7 million.

Hawk Tuah Girl Haliey Welch’s Disastrous Crypto Launch According to reports, $HAWK’s market cap ballooned to $490 million before swiftly plunging 91% shortly following its launch on Wednesday, December 4. Blockchain data firm Bubble Maps shows that upwards of an estimated 80% of all wallets and snipers were controlled by insiders, skewing the token’s value. “We tried to stop snipers as best we could through high fee’s in the start of launch on @MeteoraAG ,” Welch said in a Thursday X post. “Fee’s have now been dropped.” Copy and pasting: Hawkanomics: Team hasn’t sold one token and not 1 KOL was given 1 free token We tried to stop snipers as best we could through high fee’s in the start of launch on @MeteoraAG Fee’s have now been dropped pic.twitter.com/E7xN9VmCrx — Haliey Welch (@HalieyWelchX) December 4, 2024 Following the cryptocurrency’s stunning collapse, purchasers of $HAWK soon took to social media to share their woes over the alleged pump-and-dump scheme. “My $35,000 that I purchased of $Hawk is now $2,000 after 10 minutes of buying,” one X user shared Wednesday, claiming they used their children’s college funds to invest in the coin. “I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah, but you took my life savings.” “I’m down around $20,000 right now on the $HAWK token,” posted another. “I really hope that @HalieyWelchX can provide us with some roadmap updates or something.” “I for one am completely shocked and surprised by the way this turned out,” he added. “Please send help asap.” Just filed my report against @HalieyWelchX and the $HAWK team for rugging investors.

Pump-and-dump schemes, in which a small cluster of insiders illegitimately inflate a token’s value, have long been a hallmark of celebrity-endorsed cryptocurrencies and meme coins .

PEPE: Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum blockchain, paying homage to the popular Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. Aiming to join the ranks of top meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE emphasizes simplicity with a no-tax policy and a clear acknowledgment of its lack of utility beyond being a meme. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market cap reaching up to $1.6 billion, drawing a dedicated community. While its rapid growth reflects strong interest in meme coins, the volatile nature of such assets means that its attractiveness in the current market cycle is uncertain and largely depends on market sentiment. PONKE: A New Digital Asset for Traders and Gamers on Solana PONKE is a new digital token on the Solana blockchain, known for fast transactions and low fees. With a total supply of 555 million tokens, it aims to serve online traders and gaming enthusiasts. PONKE focuses on providing a seamless and engaging experience in these areas. It is available on major cryptocurrency exchanges, making it accessible to a wide audience. The token emphasizes community involvement, offering features like a ""helmet"" for members and active social media channels. PONKE's approach and integration into popular platforms may make it appealing in the current market cycle. POPCAT: Exploring a New Cryptocurrency Opportunity POPCAT is a new cryptocurrency aiming to breathe life into the market. It addresses common issues like inactive wallets, pump and dump schemes, and rug pulls. POPCAT focuses on creating a secure and transparent environment for investors. Its technology emphasizes community engagement and market revitalization. In the current market cycle, many are seeking the next significant opportunity after missing out on coins like $BONK on Solana. POPCAT presents a potential option for those looking for substantial gains. Its approach could make it an attractive choice for investors searching for promising ventures. Conclusion While PEPE, PONKE, and POPCAT have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering 700% ROI in its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it provides governance rights, rewards loyalty, and allows staking for passive income. Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts to fight for freedom.

37265938,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51461,1733436418,Ripple CLO Slams Outgoing SEC Chair Gensler’s Latest Action,"Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, recently criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its continued litigation against cryptocurrency companies, specifically in its ongoing case against Binance . His remarks on Twitter highlighted the SEC’s filing of an 81-page brief containing recycled arguments, including the assertion that cryptocurrency lacks inherent value—a claim Alderoty called “absurd and unsupported.” Instead of standing down and pausing crypto litigation with new leadership just weeks away, Gensler's SEC filed an 81-page brief in the Binance case yesterday, recycling the same failed arguments—including the absurd (and unsupported) claim that crypto has no inherent value.… — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) December 5, 2024 Calls for Clearer Regulation and Modernized Frameworks This comment comes amid growing scrutiny of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s enforcement approach to crypto regulation. Critics argue that the SEC prioritizes aggressive litigation rather than fostering a clear and balanced regulatory framework. Alderoty has repeatedly underscored the need for regulatory clarity, emphasizing that the SEC’s reliance on outdated interpretations of the Howey Test fails to adequately address the uniqueness of digital assets. John Deaton, a prominent crypto lawyer, echoed Alderoty’s sentiment, referencing the Howey Test to demonstrate the irrelevance of intrinsic value in determining whether an asset constitutes a security. Deaton questioned the SEC’s interpretation and suggested that such arguments undermine the credibility of its legal filings. Observers within the cryptocurrency community, such as Nomad_XRP, have framed the SEC’s actions as a hindrance to innovation. They argue that while the SEC’s lawsuits create temporary market disruptions, they have allowed some investors to accumulate assets like XRP at lower prices, providing a silver lining amid regulatory uncertainty. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Industry The SEC’s strategy under Gensler has faced broader criticism for its lack of clarity and consistency. The Commission’s cases against companies such as Binance, Coinbase, and Ripple highlight its expansive application of securities laws, which many view as an overreach. Notably, Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in the Ripple case last year delivered a mixed outcome, affirming that XRP was not inherently a security but finding certain institutional sales by Ripple in violation of securities laws. This ongoing debate underscores the critical need for modernized regulatory frameworks tailored to the digital asset industry. As the SEC continues its enforcement actions, legal challenges from firms like Ripple are expected to shape the future of crypto regulation, potentially forcing greater accountability and clarity from U.S. regulatory bodies. Whether Gensler’s approach will withstand judicial scrutiny or catalyze calls for legislative reform remains to be seen. However, the persistent criticisms from industry leaders like Alderoty highlight the growing tension between innovation and regulation in the crypto space.

AVA Chiang Mai Night Safari (AVA) Meet AVA , the golden tiger cub capturing hearts across Thailand and beyond. With her radiant golden coat—a rare result of recessive genes—Ava is one of fewer than 100 golden tigers in the world. Her enchanting photos and videos are spreading joy on the internet, much like Moo Deng the hippo did before her. Ava's unique beauty and charm have made her an instant sensation, bringing attention to the rare and magnificent creatures that share our planet. But Ava's influence doesn't stop at adorable snapshots; she's inspiring a new wave in the crypto world. The AVA Token, a community-driven project, is riding the momentum of her growing fame during this exciting altcoin season. Following the impressive rise of MOODENG Token in recent months, AVA Token is generating buzz among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Currently trading on decentralized exchanges, it reflects a trend where internet culture and blockchain technology intersect. As the market embraces innovative projects, AVA Token stands out as a symbol of how viral phenomena can spark interest in new digital ventures. Mr Mayonnaise the Cat (MAYO) Meet Mr. Mayonnaise, a three-year-old ragdoll cat whose brush with death is inspiring a new crypto movement. Found unresponsive under a neighbor's car, his family feared he was hit by a vehicle. A second hospital visit revealed the real culprit: a hidden paralysis tick buried deep in his fluffy fur. The venom left him unable to breathe on his own, needing intensive care at a staggering $9,000 a day. Against all odds, this resilient feline is fighting back—and so is his community. Enter MAYO Token, a meme coin born from Mr. Mayonnaise's incredible story. Rallying behind the idea that if a tick bite costs more than a car, it deserves its own currency, the token is catching fire in the crypto space. With its low market cap and heartfelt origin, it's capturing hearts and wallets alike. In a market that loves a good underdog story, MAYO Token stands out, much like Dogecoin did with its canine charm. As investors search for the next big thing, this fluffy fighter's token could be an attractive option in the current market cycle. Only time will tell, but for now, Mr. Mayonnaise is not just surviving—he's thriving. SPX6900 (SPX) In the digital age where numbers on a screen can overshadow the allure of gold, a new meme token called SPX6900 has emerged from the depths of internet culture. Born as a playful jab at traditional finance, SPX6900 is on an audacious quest to surpass the S&P 500 by reaching an eye-popping $69 trillion market cap. The logic is humorously simple: 6900 beats 500, so SPX6900 must be the superior investment. This whimsical journey captures the spirit of a community united by the belief that bigger numbers make better investments. While SPX6900 started as a joke, its potential lies in the power of collective enthusiasm. Built on blockchain technology, it offers transparency and security like other cryptocurrencies. In a market where meme coins like Dogecoin have surged thanks to internet fandom, SPX6900 could ride a similar wave. With investors always on the lookout for the next viral sensation, this token's blend of humor and ambition makes it an intriguing contender. Compared to established coins, SPX6900 is a wild card, but in today's unpredictable market, that might just make it attractive to those willing to take a chance. CatSlap (SLAP) Meet CATSLAP, the fierce feline roaring into the crypto scene. With the SLAP token, this cat aims to topple the meme coin heavyweights like frogs and dogs. It's not just another meme coin; it's an aggressive contender ready to shake things up. Slappers around the world are joining the fun, competing to earn the highest scores. By keeping on slapping, you can boost your country's score and climb up the Slapometer! In a market crowded with meme coins, CATSLAP brings something fresh. Its interactive element engages users in a playful competition, adding a new twist to the crypto experience. While the current market sees many meme coins vying for attention, SLAP stands out with its energetic community and bold attitude. For those interested in the meme coin space, CATSLAP might be a coin to watch as it strives to dethrone the current favorites. Conclusion In the bull run of 2024, AVA, MAYO, SPX, and SLAP show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) leads by uniting sports fans in a pioneering memecoin.

The wallet, which until recently supported Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, will add its fourth L1 chain. SUI and its ecosystem will soon be accessible through Phantom Wallet, one of the most widely used Web3 apps. SUI is one of the trending L1 chains with growing metrics, whose native token also reached an all-time high above $4.20. 🚨BREAKING NEWS 🚨 @Phantom is coming to the Sui ecosystem! One wallet. Endless possibilities. Intuitive multichain features. ✨ From native bridges to seamless asset swaps, you’ll soon be able to explore everything Sui has to offer with the wallet trusted by millions.… pic.twitter.com/8jnDAgJUns — Sui (@SuiNetwork) December 5, 2024 On its side, Phantom announced the addition of SUI is imminent and the chain will become active soon. The SUI network expanded in 2024, finally reaching a breakout after a slower performance in 2023. SUI is a relatively new arrival on the crypto market, launching after the 2022 turbulence had passed. The chain carries more than 670K daily active addresses, closing in on Ethereum’s activity level. Phantom will add to the project’s exposure, as its trending section has raised multiple tokens from obscurity. This time, Phantom will add a whole new network, potentially tapping Solana users to test out the SUI ecosystem. The addition of SUI raised expectations of introducing a meme token ecosystem. After the boom of Solana tokens, other chains created their own launchpads, including TRON, BNB Smart Chain, and even Ripple. This set up expectations for SUI to continue the trend. SUI already has a tokenized ecosystem, valued at over $2.8B for all stablecoins and tokens. The multi-asset capabilities of Phantom may give those tokens more exposure and swapping opportunities. SUI trading reaches peak activity Just before the announcement, SUI extended its rally, peaking at $4.49. Later, the native network token slid to $4.19. Trading volumes reached an all-time high at $4.16B for the past 24 hours, after an extended period of active trading. The current rally set expectations for SUI going above $7, continuing its bull market into 2025. SUI is also considered a prime candidate for being added to a Grayscale investment product. SUI expanded to an all-time high after the rise of general altcoin market hype. | Source: Counmarketcap Open interest for SUI expanded to $747M, an all-time peak. Most SUI derivative positions shifted to long as the rally showed significant strength. The recent price expansion once again invited comparisons between SUI and Solana. SUI is considered to have a similar potential for influence as Solana, though still at an early stage. The token’s relatively low price also invites buyers who expect a breakout to a higher range. The SUI rally at the end of 2024 is also steeper compared to the SOL expansion above $200. SUI started from lows of $0.70, bringing higher returns. SUI aims to grow its DeFi sector The rising price of SUI is boosting the chain’s DeFi and DEX sector. The chain already hosts $1.71B in total value locked, also reaching an all-time high. The SUI L1 chain carries $319M in stablecoin value, still lagging behind similar chains like Toncoin (TON). SUI is still valued at just 7% of Ethereum’s value, lagging behind other top L1 chains. The project generates around $50K in daily fees, indicating still relatively low activity levels. The chief DeFi protocol is NaVi with more than $500M in value locked. SuiLend and Cetus are respectively the biggest lending protocol and the main DEX on the L1 chain. The biggest setback for SUI is its complicated unlocking schedule. Only 35.75% of the SUI supply is unlocked, with multiple investor unlocks coming over the next few years. SUI has a long-term unlock plan, with regular inflows of under 1% of the supply. The next unlock is expected on January 1, releasing 81.91M SUI valued at $338.6M. If the SUI ecosystem grows, the tokens may offer more holding incentives. In the case of an ongoing altcoin bull market, some SUI selling may be absorbed. SUI is one of the best-financed projects in crypto and a promising L1. In total, all SUI rounds raised $385.3M, with $49.37M raised in a public sale. SUI is backed by Coinbase Ventures, Binance Labs, Andreessen Horowitz and other VC funds, raising the bulk of its funds in a $300M Series B financing. For now, SUI has broken out, not behaving like a VC coin with constant selling and price pressure.

Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene with its playful take on the famous Pepe the Frog meme. Launched on Ethereum as a deflationary memecoin, it pays tribute to the internet icon created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s.

37265937,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51384,1733436026,Peak Volatility Drives Volume Out From Solana; But Why Is This Bullish $0.06 Coin Going Parabolic?,"Solana (SOL) experiences volatility in the current bull run as the coin slumps down after making new all-time highs. The token’s volatility increased following a decrease in the social activity of the altcoin. Moreover, Solana (SOL) has lost its position to Tether. On the contrary, IntelMarkets is making news with its rapid ascent in the market! Investors are rushing to grab the opportunity before the coin’s value increases further. Solana (SOL) Faces Bearish Sentiments Solana’s (SOL) falling bullish sentiment is evident in its market capitalization position. Solana (SOL) traded as the fourth most valuable crypto by market capitalization two days earlier. With its market capitalization dropping to $107 billion, SOL has lost its fourth position to Tether. After the development, Solana’s (SOL) social indicators declined, particularly the weighted sentiment. Weighted Sentiment modifies values based on the number of mentions, normalizing data to make different asset sentiments comparable. This means spikes or dips in the metric will occur when a coin receives huge mentions. A positive value implies that most remarks about the coin are bullish. On the contrary, a negative value means that most comments regarding the cryptocurrency are bearish. Data from Santiment shows Solana’s (SOL) weighted sentiment has fallen to negative territory. This implies that most market players are not optimistic about Solana’s (SOL) short-term price movement. If this pattern persists, demand for Solana (SOL) may decline in the next few days. Social dominance, another indicator, also suggests that SOL’s price could face a further downturn. Social dominance compares the degree of debate about a cryptocurrency to other assets on the market. For Solana (SOL), the social dominance indicator has declined from 8.42% on November 17 to 3.60% today. The drop in this reading suggests Solana’s (SOL) price may find it challenging to recover to its ATH in the short term. its price is down 0.55% in 24 hours to $225.07.

37265627,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=657940,1733436013,Dogecoin Poised For A Huge Breakout: Here’s Why Today Could Be The Day,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price stands at a critical juncture as technical analysts point toward a potentially significant breakout. Renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital has identified a pivotal pattern on the DOGE/USD daily price chart, suggesting an imminent surge. Will Dogecoin Price Confirm The Breakout Today? The daily chart of Dogecoin reveals an ascending triangle formation that has been developing over recent weeks. This pattern is typically considered a bullish continuation signal, characterized by a horizontal upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. The formation indicates accumulating buying pressure, as each price retracement becomes shallower—implying that bulls are willing to buy at higher lows. The top horizontal line of the triangle sits at approximately $0.44, a level that has been tested multiple times and serves as a significant barrier for upward movement. The ascending support trendline begins around $0.34 and rises gently, forming the triangle’s lower boundary and highlighting increasing support levels. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Mirrors Last Cycle, The Surge To $4 Begins At Week’s End Rekt Capital emphasizes the importance of the current price action, stating: “Dogecoin has followed every Bitcoin thus far. Now retesting the top of the Ascending Triangle as support. Successful retest here is crucial to precede a confirmed breakout.” If this retest solidifies the triangle’s upper resistance as a new support level, it could pave the way for a substantial price increase. The potential breakout target can be calculated by measuring the maximum height of the triangle—from the base near $0.34 to the top at $0.44—and projecting it upwards from the breakout point. This suggests that Dogecoin could potentially reach or exceed the $0.54 mark. Dogecoin Price Analysis (4-Hour Chart) Another prominent crypto analyst, Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper), has provided insights based on the 4-hour DOGE/USD chart. He notes: “DOGECOIN/usdt 4 hour: DOGE still consolidating, for almost 1 month now, but this flawless ascending channel is filling out nicely and the breakout is going to be EPIC, just wait.” The chart illustrates an ascending channel pattern, characterized by two parallel upward-sloping lines containing the price action. This pattern is recognized as bullish, formed by higher lows and higher highs. The Dogecoin price has been oscillating between these lines, with the lower line acting as support and the upper line as resistance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is ‘Ready To Run Again’ – Analyst Expects 60% Rally Currently, the price is nearing the midline of the channel, which provides significant resistance around $0.46. Key levels to watch include: The lower boundary support sits around $0.40. The upper boundary resistance is near $0.52, a potential catalyst for Dogecoin’s next major move. The price target following an ascending channel breakout can be estimated by measuring the channel’s height at its widest part and extending that distance upward from the breakout point. This projection suggests that DOGE could rise towards $0.64. Adding to the technical signals, there could be a major catalyst for DOGE price today, December 5th. As reported by NewsBTC, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are set to address members of Congress. They are expected to present key proposals under the auspices of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This development could have a substantial impact on the Dogecoin price, as Elon Musk’s involvement with the memecoin has historically influenced market sentiment. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.44.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA.

The 1-month price change of 175.53% highlights strong upward momentum. With the 10-day moving average at $0.4143 nearing the 100-day average of $0.4234, a bullish crossover is possible. The RSI at 52.17 indicates room for further gains before reaching overbought levels. Breaking above the nearest resistance at $0.5042 could propel Dogecoin to the next level of $0.5898, a potential rise of 16.97%. As altcoin season approaches and the market bullish, Dogecoin could be poised for significant growth. Cardano on the Rise: ADA Eyes $1.35 Amid Bullish Momentum Cardano has been showing strong upward movement, with its price ranging between $0.96 and $1.25 recently. Over the past week, ADA has surged by 27.6%, and an impressive 267.87% in the past month. The Relative Strength Index stands at 52.61, indicating potential for more growth. With the nearest resistance level at $1.35, a break above this could propel ADA towards the second resistance at $1.64. If this momentum continues, we could see gains of over 30% from current levels. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $1.21, suggesting bullish sentiment. Cardano looks poised for significant growth as the altcoin season unfolds. NEAR Protocol Surges 100% in a Month: Poised for Further Growth? After surging over 100% in the past month, NEAR Protocol is showing strong momentum. The current price hovers between $6.17 and $7.46, breaking above the 100-day simple moving average at $7.03. With the nearest resistance at $8, a rally past this level could lead to the next target at $9.30. The relative strength index at 56.69 suggests there is room for further upward movement. If the bullish trend continues, NEAR could rise another 20% to reach its next resistance. The recent 13.12% gain over the week supports this positive outlook. The altcoin season may boost NEAR even more. Bonk (BONK) Poised for Significant Gains as Altcoin Season Nears Bonk (BONK) is showing strong signs of potential growth. Over the past month, its price has surged by over 136%, indicating rising investor interest. Trading between $0.00004096 and $0.00005010, BONK is nearing its nearest resistance level at $0.00005412. A break above this could lead to gains of over 20%, aiming for the next resistance at $0.00006326. Technical indicators support this upward momentum: the MACD is positive, and the RSI at 53.95 suggests there's room for growth before overbought conditions occur. While the stochastic is slightly high at 80.67, the overall trend points upwards. With the altcoin season approaching, BONK could be poised for significant gains. Conclusion While DOGE, ADA, NEAR, and BONK have limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out, designed for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, building a community of leaders and offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

37265517,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623525,1733435127,Crypto traders are already expecting a Bitcoin correction,"Bitcoin’s long-awaited break above $100,000 has ignited a flurry of activity in the crypto market, but not all of it is bullish. Traders are taking positions to prepare for a potential pullback after the historic rally. Options data reveals a massive increase in demand for puts, contracts that allow the holder to sell Bitcoin at a fixed price within a set timeframe. Amberdata shows that puts with strike prices at $95,000 and $100,000 have seen the largest open interest over the past 24 hours. Traders are also snapping up puts at even lower levels, with $75,000 and $70,000 strike prices gaining popularity, Bloomberg reported . According to Luke Nolan, a research associate at CoinShares, these positions are primarily set to expire between late December and late February. He explained that this timeline aligns with the market’s expectations for potential surprises following Bitcoin’s sudden price surge. Funding rates signal high leverage Despite the hedging activity, bullish sentiment remains strong. Bitcoin’s funding rate, a critical metric for gauging leverage in perpetual futures contracts, is nearing record highs. This means that traders are aggressively leveraging long positions, betting on further price increases. On the options side, short-dated calls with strike prices between $100,000 and $110,000 have seen a significant spike in activity. Overnight, over $2 million was spent on call spreads between $110,000 and $160,000, set to expire in late January, according to Wintermute OTC trader Jake Ostrovskis. Elevated funding rates often precede corrections, as seen during Bitcoin’s rally in March, where funding rates hit an annualized high of 145% on Deribit. Institutional traders are also playing a big role in the current market dynamics. CME futures, a preferred tool for institutional investors in America, are trading at insanely huge premiums. Offshore exchanges, alongside new options tied to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, have seen increased activity as well. At press time, Bitcoin has actually already corrected a little.

This Best New Meme Coin Right Now is All You Need Today,"Meme coins have become a cultural phenomenon, capturing the imaginations—and wallets—of investors worldwide. Shiba Inu (SHIB) was one of the breakout stars of the meme coin revolution, transforming early adopters into crypto millionaires seemingly overnight. Its astronomical rise from obscurity to becoming a household name was a moment for the ages. But here’s the catch: if you weren’t in on SHIB early, you might’ve felt like you missed the boat. Don’t sweat it, though, because a new star is rising. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is not just riding the meme coin wave; it’s flipping the script with a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a loyal Bulls Squad community that’s ready to send it to the stratosphere. If SHIB proved anything, it’s that meme coins have the power to deliver exponential returns. BTFD is carrying that legacy forward while adding utility and innovation that Shiba Inu never had in its early days. With its presale already hitting its 7th stage in record time—raising over $1 million in just 10 days—BTFD is turning heads as the Best New Meme Coin Right Now . Let’s explore how these two tokens stack up and why BTFD could be your ticket to a crypto win. BTFD Coin: Utility, Rewards, and a Community on the Rise BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin looking to cash in on the hype—it’s a fully loaded ecosystem built to last. Let’s start with its Play-to-Earn game. Imagine earning crypto just by playing a game. BTFD’s P2E platform rewards players with tokens for completing missions, competing in challenges, and levelling up their avatars. Whether you’re a casual gamer or a hardcore competitor, this game is designed to keep you engaged and rewarded. Then there’s staking. If you’re all about passive income, you’ll love BTFD’s staking rewards. With an impressive Annual Percentage Yield (APY), staking your tokens means you’re making money while you sleep. It’s simple: lock up your BTFD tokens, and watch them grow. The rewards are not just lucrative but also stabilise the ecosystem, making it more robust for the long haul. And let’s not forget the Bulls Squad. This isn’t just a fanbase—it’s a movement. The community behind BTFD is as passionate as they come, with members driving the project’s momentum through social media, collaborations, and grassroots marketing. It’s this kind of energy that helped BTFD’s presale hit its 7th stage in just 10 days, selling over 23 billion coins to more than 2,400 holders. Now, let’s talk numbers. At its current presale price of $0.000064, an investment of $17,500 would fetch you a whopping 273,437,500 BTFD tokens. When the presale ends at $0.0006, that same investment would balloon to $164,062. That’s nearly 10X your money before the coin even hits public exchanges. If that doesn’t make you sit up and take notice, what will? Shiba Inu: The Pioneer That Paved the Way Shiba Inu is a legend in the meme coin world, and for good reason. Launched in August 2020, SHIB branded itself as the “Dogecoin Killer” and quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts. But what really set SHIB apart was its community—the so-called “Shib Army.” They rallied around the token, spreading its message far and wide across social media, meme forums, and even mainstream news outlets. The result? Shiba Inu went from being a joke to a juggernaut. At its peak in 2021, SHIB delivered mind-blowing returns to its early investors, turning small bets into life-changing sums. For instance, if you’d invested just $100 in SHIB when it launched, you’d have made millions when it hit its all-time high of $0.00008845. That’s the kind of return that doesn’t just build wealth—it creates legends. However, SHIB’s success story wasn’t without its challenges. It lacked utility in its early days, relying almost entirely on hype and community support. While the Shiba Inu ecosystem has since expanded to include features like ShibaSwap and its own NFT platform, these developments came much later. In the early days, it was all about the meme. For those who missed out on SHIB’s infancy, it’s easy to feel like the opportunity of a lifetime passed you by. But BTFD Coin is here to remind you that lightning can strike twice—especially when it’s backed by innovation, utility, and a dedicated community. Why BTFD Coin is the Best New Meme Coin Right Now Here’s the bottom line: BTFD Coin is everything a modern meme coin should be. It’s got the fun, the community, and the hype, but it also brings real-world utility to the table. The P2E game makes it a hit with gamers. The staking rewards attract investors who want passive income. And the Bulls Squad community ensures that the project has the energy and momentum to keep climbing. Let’s not overlook its presale performance, either. Raising over $1 million in less than 10 days is no small feat. BTFD’s presale is structured across 16 stages, and it’s already nearly halfway through, with each stage bringing incremental price increases. The current price of $0.000064 is a steal compared to its listing price of $0.0006, making now the perfect time to jump in. If you’re still on the fence, consider this: analysts predict that BTFD could follow in the footsteps of Shiba Inu, delivering exponential returns to early investors. But unlike SHIB, BTFD is entering the market with a robust ecosystem already in place, giving it a strong foundation for growth. It’s not just the Best New Meme Coin Right Now—it’s a smart investment for anyone looking to ride the next big wave in crypto . The Final Thoughts Shiba Inu showed the world what meme coins could do, but it’s not the end of the story. BTFD Coin is picking up the torch and running with it, combining the fun of meme culture with the power of utility and rewards. Whether you’re a gamer, an investor, or just someone who loves being part of a vibrant community, BTFD has something for you. But here’s the kicker: time is running out. The presale price won’t stay at $0.000064 forever, and with each stage, the opportunity for exponential returns shrinks. Don’t be the person who looks back and says, “I wish I’d joined BTFD when I had the chance.” Join the BTFD Coin presale now , secure your stake, and get ready to ride the wave to financial freedom. This is your moment. Don’t let it pass you by. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin presale today.

Bitcoin (BTC): The First Cryptocurrency and Its Market Potential Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency, introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto as a digital cash system. It operates on blockchain technology, enabling decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authorities like banks. Transactions are verified through mining, where participants solve complex puzzles to validate exchanges and earn bitcoins as rewards. The network has a capped supply of 21 million bitcoins, and every four years, a ""halving"" event reduces miners' rewards by half. This scarcity model can impact mining profitability and network stability. Bitcoin's technology offers resilience against fraud and has potential for reshaping financial systems. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin remains attractive due to its pioneering status and growing acceptance in mainstream finance. Ethereum: Advancing Decentralized Applications with Proof-of-Stake Ethereum is a leading blockchain platform known for its smart contracts and extensive decentralized application ecosystem. Operating on a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism since the Merge in 2022, it supports decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to enhance transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, widely used for governance and utility, while ETH remains essential for transaction fees. The upcoming sharding phase aims to improve scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) facilitates transactions, rewards stakers, and serves as a tradable asset and collateral. With ongoing technological advancements, Ethereum continues to demonstrate significant potential in the blockchain sector. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Borderless Payments XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger. It was created to be fast, low-cost, open, and borderless. Transactions are processed without a central authority, making them secure and irreversible. XRP does not require a bank account for settlements. It was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. At launch, 100 billion XRP were created, with 80 billion given to Ripple for development. Ripple uses XRP to enhance liquidity and supports the ecosystem by placing 55 billion XRP in escrow. XRP aims to make payment transfers across currencies seamless. In the current market, XRP offers potential due to its speed and low transaction costs, making it attractive for global payments. Conclusion While BTC, ETH, and XRP offer stability, their short-term potential is limited. DOGEN, crafted for those seeking luxury and success, presents a unique opportunity. Expected to grow by 700% by the end of presale, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN is building a community of leaders. Early adopters gain exclusive benefits and perks.

37265178,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-exec-founds-internet-depin,1733434200,Solana Foundation exec departs for ‘the most interesting experiment in crypto’,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Solana Foundation’s head of strategy Austin Federa announced he would be departing the nonprofit to found DoubleZero, a network of fiber and subsea cables meant to establish a faster and more performant “new internet.” Federa had been at Solana Labs and Foundation for nearly four years, becoming one of Solana’s more recognizable public figures. He’s now founding DoubleZero — which will start by supporting Solana — alongside cofounders Mateo Ward and Andrew McConnell. Jito CEO Lucas Bruder called the startup “the most interesting experiment in crypto.” DoubleZero is an ambitious and potentially category-defining project, but I think it could be thought of for now as decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) for the internet. Individuals in the DoubleZero network contribute fiber optic links, which are basically cables that transmit data with light pulses, to a network that can filter out data before it gets to blockchain validators and RPCs. This all seems like it will be incentivized with a native token and enforced with proof-of-stake slashing, but DoubleZero’s white paper does not explicitly mention what form its “rewards” might take. Where will DoubleZero find all this unused fiberoptic cable, you might ask? The project’s white paper argues that there is “substantial” spare fiber in the world. This comes from the hundreds of terabits per second modern fiber can handle, “dark fiber” that has been installed but sits unused, and enterprises purchasing more fiber capacity than they need to prepare for doomsday scenarios. If all this unused fiber joined DoubleZero’s rewards-based network, it could build a faster new internet just with existing real-world infrastructure. Part of the impetus to create DoubleZero is that fast blockchains like Solana aren’t slowed down by how nice of hardware the blockchain’s software is being run on — they’re kneecapped by the fact that blockchain data is sent over the public internet where it is mixed with web traffic that doesn’t need to run as fast as a blockchain. As things stand, blockchain validators have to use some of their computing resources to filter out spam and deduplicate transactions. DoubleZero and its network of fiberoptic links will look to be a “common shield” for local validators, so all of their resources can go toward building and verifying blocks. DoubleZero’s white paper says layer-1 blockchains are the best use case for the network, but outside of blockchain, content delivery networks, games, large language models, and enterprises could all benefit. In recent weeks, Solana’s community has taken up that mantra of increasing bandwidth and reducing latency. To paraphrase Michael Jordan, Federa and his cofounders took that personally.

37265005,https://nulltx.com/?p=135302,1733434053,"DOGECOIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 5) – Amid Consolidation, Can Doge Resume Rally Following The Latest Gain?","Doge’s overall market structure remains bullish on the daily chart, but the price is still calm since it faced rejections last month. It looks prepared for another rally while showing signs of strength on the day. Last month’s trading marked a historic moment for many Doge holders as the price rallied by more than 200% to reach a new milestone after three years of trading. Unfortunately, exhaustion set in and the buying pressure cooled off, ending that month in a neutral mode. The start of this month has been relatively indecisive as the leading meme coin subjected to a consolidation phase. While the next major move remains unknown, the bullish structure remains intact on the daily chart. A push above the consolidation phase should activate more upsurge. Anticipating the next move, the key $1 level is the target price to watch in the near term. A surge through this key level should trigger a bigger rally on the macro level. In the opposite direction, dropping off the consolidation phase could lead to a major retracement before deciding on the next move. Once it finds a solid ground, we can expect a bounce back. Considering the latest positive sentiment surrounding the market, the price is more likely to go bullish than bearish. DOGE’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing above $0.48, Doge’s next price target would be $0.6, followed by $0.75. If the price flips those levels, the next area of interest for the bulls would be $0.9. If the price breaks below $0.35, the immediate support level to watch for a retracement is $0.298. Failure to bounce off this support could bring us to a low of $0.229. Another support level to keep in mind is $0.18. Key Resistance Levels: $0.48, $0.6, $0.75 Key Support Levels: $0.35, $0.298, $0.229 Spot Price: $0.44 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It will be great to see that trend change in 2025. pic.twitter.com/3lrP3ABkYy — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) December 5, 2024 “Submitting our Nasdaq application represents a pivotal step in our journey to bridge institutional investment with the boundless potential of the Solana ecosystem,” Leah Wald, CEO of Sol Strategies, said. “This milestone positions us to drive transformative growth and deliver sustained value to our shareholders as we bring our strategic vision to life.” While the application is being reviewed, Sol Strategies’ common stock will continue trading on the OTC market under the ticker “CYFRF” and on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) under the ticker “HODL.” On December 2, 2024, Sol Strategies announced a letter of intent detailing plans to acquire additional validators to strengthen its position in the Solana ecosystem. The transaction would increase the SOL delegated to the company’s validators by 554,714 SOL, reaching 1,493,378 SOL—valued at CAD $470.4 million. The deal includes a USD $750,000 cash payment (or equivalent in SOL or USDC) upon closing and USD $750,000 in common shares issued at the agreement’s signing price. An additional USD $5 million in shares will be issued over three years, contingent on performance targets. Is Sol Strategies the MicroStrategy of Solana? A Look at Their Crypto Playbook In September, the company rebranded from Cypherpunk Holding s and has since focused on Solana’s blockchain, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. It has intensified efforts to purchase and stake Solana’s native token, SOL. Since starting its SOL acquisition strategy in Q2 2024, under the leadership of former Valkyrie CEO Leah Wald, the firm now stakes 254,380 SOL, with half coming from third-party delegators. This staking activity has already generated 1,430 SOL (around $242,000) in revenue, with profits reinvested into acquiring more SOL . Sol Strategies ’ approach parallels MicroStrategy’s pivot to Bitcoin in 2020, with both firms leveraging crypto as a treasury management tool. Just as MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings became a proxy for investors seeking exposure to the asset, Sol Strategies aims to offer similar exposure to Solana. In June, while still operating as Cypherpunk Holdings, the company became one of the first publicly traded firms to add SOL to its balance sheet. This move has positioned its stock as a vehicle for traders to gain indirect exposure to Solana, one of the fastest-growing blockchains, without directly buying the token.

But data shows they're gobbling up a growing amount of the crypto economy too.  The sector — powered by the likes of dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) — made up 3.16% of the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies on Dec. 1, up from 1.3% at the beginning of the year, according to a new report from crypto exchange CEX.IO. If you exclude crypto titans bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), memecoin market share jumps to 11.21% from 4.2%.  That equates to big dollars: more than $140 billion of market value, per CoinGecko data, stashed in cryptocurrencies that don't pretend to have any utility. Extremely volatile by nature, they tend to be named after animals, viral internet jokes and political figures or events.  As bitcoin topples the $100,000 threshold for the first time, memecoins are also rocketing higher. Dogecoin has soared 168% since Donald Trump's election spurred throughout the crypto market. Dogecoin is now the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $64 billion, according to CoinDesk data.  The question is whether this is just how things work in the early stages of a bull market these days, or a harbinger that things have gotten overheated.  ""In previous cycles, memecoins typically experienced their largest capital rotation toward the end of the post-halving bull run,"" Alexandr Kerya, vice president of product management at CEX.IO, told CoinDesk in an email.  ""Halving"" refers to the once-every-four-years event — the most recent one was early in 2014 — when the reward for mining bitcoin gets slashed by 50%, which often correlates with crypto gains.  ""However, this cycle stands out due to the significant rise in memecoin influence occurring well before the halving, and persisting even during bitcoin’s consolidation mid-year,"" Kerya added.  The oldest memecoin, dogecoin, was created as a joke in 2013 and gained significant attention during the bull market that ended in 2021 as Tesla CEO Elon Musk repeatedly posted about it on social media. Other dog-themed coins, like SHIB, rode on DOGE's coat-tails and reached billions of dollars of valuation. Over time, memecoins came to be considered as a crypto investment category in their own right, in the same vein as decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, artificial intelligence tokens or privacy coins.  ""While memecoins may eventually reach a plateau, similar to DeFi, the market is still in the process of determining where that equilibrium will be established,"" Kerya wrote.  Eating up market share  The memecoin sector underwent explosive growth early this year, the report said, when the daily number of projects deployed on Pump.fun — a Solana-based crypto project that makes it easy for users to launch tokens — went from a few dozen a day in February to thousands per day in March. Nowadays, over 60,000 memecoins are created daily, half of them through Pump.fun, the report said.  As a sector, memecoins saw a 330% increase in their combined market capitalization over the period from Jan. 1 to Dec. 1, the report said. For comparison, bitcoin is up 140% since the beginning of the year, while ether is up 71%. Memecoin trading volume grew 979% in the same period, and now accounts for 5.27% of the entire crypto market's volume. Furthermore, memecoins retained significant volume in June while other sectors of the crypto economy saw declines.  ""As a gateway for new investors, the growth of memecoins highlights the increasing influence of retail-driven narratives in the crypto market. As a sentiment bet, it reflects market optimism and the anticipation of a continuation of the post-halving rally,"" Kerya wrote. ""However, with increased share of memecoins, it also highlights the potential for the faster appearance of speculative bubbles. While this could amplify the intensity of a bull run, it might also shorten its duration.""  The memecoin sector has changed over the years. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu dominated trading volume and market capitalization in 2021. In contrast, 2024 has seen a wide variety of newer memecoins — such as dogwifhat (WIF), Brett (BRETT), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) and Popcat (POPCAT) — crack (or come close to) the top 100 coins by market cap.  And whereas the majority of the largest memecoins were dog-themed up until March, cat-themed and AI-themed tokens have been stealing market share from dog tokens. Political memecoins also fared well into the U.S. election in November, after which they saw an 80% drop in trading volume.  The networks on which trading activity occurs have also shifted. Dogecoin has its own proof-of-work blockchain, which mimics the Bitcoin network's. Ethereum-based memecoins such as pepe (PEPE) and MAGA (TRUMP) have also seen some popularity. But Solana, thanks to Pump.fun, is the big winner of the memecoin craze in 2024; the network accounts for 30% of the sector’s trading volume, and 15% of memecoin market cap is based on it.  However, Telegram’s TON network’s memecoin trading volume grew 750 times in the last six months, even though the blockchain still only accounts for 1% of the total memecoin market cap.  ""Given memecoins' ability to boost retail involvement and revenue generation for DeFi platforms, 2025 could see stronger integrations between launchpads and decentralized exchanges to capitalize on this trend,"" Kerya wrote. ""However, in ecosystems like Solana, heavy reliance on memecoins has raised concerns and could eventually backfire, straining its broader development.""",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/05/memecoins-reach-140-b-market-cap-and-gain-ground-in-crypto-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2da47252f94b6178d17c7a84fa44a06322d70883-2400x1597.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On the way up, March’s high is the next obstacle to keep in mind for a bigger price movement. During the November rally, which sent many altcoins to a new high, Jup posted notable gains but later faced tough resistance at $1.32 after recovering nicely from a local bottom. The price pulled back in the mid-month and reestablished support around the key $1 level. Bouncing off this key level in the late month, the price increased slowly and slightly broke above the mentioned resistance that stopped the bulls during last month’s rally. Following that breakout, the bulls gained more control and now aim for March’s high. Meanwhile, the higher high and higher low pattern is still looking intact on the daily timeframe. A break above the current yearly high should facilitate a huge rally toward $3 in the short term. Rejecting the yearly high might cause a little setback in the market before rising back. Whichever way, the bulls are currently gaining dominance. If they lose control of the market, we may see a temporal pause in buying. But as it stands, Jup looks poise for a big move and from the look of things, the price will likely explode soon. JUP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview An immediate resistance level for a test is $1.49. Moving higher, the next level to watch is $1.623 and $1.85, followed by a break to $2 and potentially $2.5. The broken $1.32 level is now considered as close support in case of a pullback. If the price rolls back under this level, lower levels to keep in mind for support are $1.2 and $0.982.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO.

Can It Reach This Level? Here Are the Details,"Following Bitcoin’s historic surge past $100,000 this week, Standard Chartered has predicted that the cryptocurrency’s price could double by the end of 2025. Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin to Double to $200,000 by End of 2025 Analyst Geoff Kendrick shared the optimistic outlook in a note published Thursday, citing strong institutional adoption as a key driver of projected growth. Kendrick noted that Standard Chartered’s $200,000 price target for Bitcoin is “achievable,” especially with continued institutional interest. “We would be even more bullish if we saw rapid adoption of BTC by US pension funds, global sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), and even a potential US strategic reserve fund,” Kendrick said. Kendrick added that institutional flows in 2025 are expected to maintain or exceed 2024 levels as firms like MicroStrategy accelerate their Bitcoin buying strategies. The firm is projected to match or exceed its 2024 Bitcoin purchases as part of its $42 billion, three-year plan. Bitcoin is set to rise over 140% in 2024, a 48% jump since President-elect Donald Trump’s November 5 election victory. The cryptocurrency’s rise to $100,000 marks a milestone that Standard Chartered predicts could occur as early as April 2023, when Bitcoin would be trading around $27,000. Standard Chartered’s bullish projection is based on Bitcoin’s continued adoption by institutional players. The firm believes that broader acceptance by pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and potential government reserves could further boost Bitcoin’s value. Bitcoin’s rally into 2024 underscores its growing appeal as a store of value and a hedge against traditional market volatility, positioning it as a key asset in both institutional and individual portfolios. *This is not investment advice.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 114,600 followers on the social media platform X that decentralized exchange (DEX) Curve Finance ( CRV ) looks primed to skyrocket by over 500%. “Unsure if we’ll even get the pullback first, but CRV looks ready for $6.80 while above $0.87.” Source: Justin Bennett/X CRV is trading for $1.11 at time of writing, a 2.7% decrease during the last 24 hours. A spike to Bennett’s target price of $6.80 would represent a 515% increase from its current level. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Bennett says that investors shouldn’t be surprised if BTC smashes through the $105,000-$106,000 price tag after it reached the six-figure milestone for the first time ever. “Six-figure Bitcoin!! Nice move off of new support. We probably see $105,000-$106,000 before some consolidation, but don’t be surprised if it rips right through.” Source: Justin Bennett/X According to Bennett, altcoins – which had an explosive month of November – could slow down in December versus the crypto king. “Nice reaction from Bitcoin dominance so far. Alts that had explosive Novembers could cool off in December as BTC takes over.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bennett says that altcoins could struggle against BTC if its current dominance level of 54% holds up.

Its price reached a historic all-time high above $100,000 earlier, followed by a plunge toward $98,000 moments ago. As CryptoPotato reported earlier, the move above $100K followed Donald Trump’s decision to make Paul Atkins the new Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In the words of the President-elect himself: “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.” The price skyrocketed and reached a high of more than $104K later in the day, but the bears weren’t finished. In the past few hours, BTC has been bleeding out and has just dropped to almost as low as $98,000 moments ago. Source: TradingView This resulted in almost $650 million worth of liquidated positions in the derivatives market, which is a 45% increase on a 24-hour basis. The majority of these are long traders, accounting for more than $400 million of the liquidations. Of course, BTC is the market where most traders are wiped off. With this latest dump, many altcoins are also now trading in the red. One example is Ripple’s XRP, which is down 3% on the day.

Bobrinskoy issued this stark warning about Bitcoin ( BTC ), labeling the cryptocurrency a “get-rich-quick scheme” driven by momentum rather than intrinsic value. Speaking on CNBC’s The Exchange , Bobrinskoy expressed concerns about Bitcoin’s reliance on minimal regulatory oversight, which he argued leaves it vulnerable to collapse when investor sentiment turns. Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its lack of regulation, enabling large, anonymous transactions, Bobrinskoy noted. He also highlighted its association with criminal activities and its detachment from traditional Know Your Customer rules as risks to the broader financial system. He dismissed Bitcoin’s initial narrative as a transactional tool, adding that its current positioning as a store of value lacks long-term sustainability. You might also like: Bitcoin HODLers book profits post-$100k ATH: report Bitcoin’s price surge is purely speculative Bobrinskoy, who manages Ariel’s focused value investment strategy and has decades of experience in investment banking, attributed Bitcoin’s recent price surges to speculative enthusiasm rather than underlying economic fundamentals. He predicted a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s value once its momentum fades, echoing concerns about the cryptocurrency undermining the U.S. dollar and exposing investors to significant risks. “So the point of this is that it has gone up because it’s gone up, and it will go down dramatically if it starts to lose that momentum — and that will happen,” he said. Ariel Investments, known for its disciplined value approach, has long focused on traditional equities.

MicroStrategy Up After Bitcoin Hits $100k The Virginia-based company, which has been buying up Bitcoin under Saylor’s direction since 2020, saw highs of greater than eight percent Thursday morning. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continued to trend upwards on the morning of December 5, hitting nearly $103.500. Year to date, $MSTR treasury operations delivered a BTC Yield of 63.3%, a net benefit of ~119,800 BTC to our shareholders.

On December 4, Saylor confirmed in an X post that the party would, in fact, be going ahead. How Much Will Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Holdings Grow? MicroStrategy has done remarkably well in light of Bitcoin’s price increase following President-elect Donald Trump’s November election. Market sentiment has largely been bolstered by Trump’s impending return to the Oval Office amid expectations that the former reality television star will enact digital asset-friendly regulations. “We will have regulations, but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” Trump stated, addressing attendees at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer. In a December 5 post to his social media platform Truth Social, the New York-born businessman did not shy away from taking credit for the cryptocurrency’s success.

Recent reports further indicate that Trump may shift regulatory power over digital assets from the SEC to the CFTC, a marked shift from President Joe Biden’s strategy regarding crypto regulations.

37264570,https://blockworks.co/news/fed-interest-rate-policy-mistake,1733431500,Is the Fed making a policy mistake?,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . There’s a lot of confusion about why the Fed might still be cutting rates right now despite what looks to be an economy that is doing pretty well. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow is currently forecasting a 3.3% real GDP growth rate for Q4, and it looks to be accelerating: Further, it looks like inflation is beginning to rebound and has bottomed: Also, financial conditions are nearly as loose as they were during the frothy 2021 era: Despite all these metrics characterizing an economy that is doing very well, the FOMC is still sitting at a 70% odds of cutting rates this December. This has many people perplexed as to why they would still cut. The simple reason is that the committee had already guided the market toward them cutting in December. They would hate to rock the boat, reverse that guidance and skip when the forward curve has already assumed they likely will. The more interesting answer resides in the rationale behind why they guided toward this cut in the first place. It has to do with r* — the neutral interest rate — and how the Fed measures it. Because r* cannot be directly measured within the economy, policymakers instead rely on models that do their best attempt at estimating it. There are currently two models well-suited for this job: the Lubik model and the Williams model. The Lubik model is more dynamic and based on a statistical model approach, whereas the Williams model is based on more traditional macroeconomic models that are less sensitive to major shifts in the drivers of r*. Considering that the creator of the Williams model — John Williams — is the current NY Fed president, this model is weighted more heavily within the confines of the Fed compared to the Lubik model. As we can see in the chart below, the Lubik model has picked up a significant uptick in r*, whereas the Wiliams model remains at a secular low. Because of this adherence to the Williams model, the FOMC continues to strongly believe monetary policy is very restrictive, and that they could easily cut to 4% and remain restrictive. However, if we use the Lubik model instead, there’s an argument to be made that monetary policy is already at neutral (at a bare minimum). Empirically (as observed in the charts at the beginning of this piece), market signals are firing off all over the place that we are in a very accommodative environment from a policy perspective. Therefore, it’s reasonable to assume the Williams model is incorrect when compared to what we’re experiencing in markets and the economy right now. There’s been a lot of talk from FOMC members lately around where they believe neutral might be. This suggests members might be rethinking their adherence to the Williams model. Some FOMC members, such as Austan Goolsbee, are even preferring to “feel their way” to neutral. See how the economy reacts, and go from there. Considering how markets across the board continue to hit all-time highs on a daily basis, it’s hard to make the argument that we’re restrictive. Regardless, a cut in December still looks to be the base case as the FOMC remains anchored to bureaucratic inertia with respect to the Williams model.

Since 2020, the company has spent over $23 billion acquiring BTC as part of founder Michael Saylor’s unconventional corporate treasury strategy. This strategy has paid off, with Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 per coin for the first time on Dec. 4. The company’s BTC treasury is now valued at over $40 billion, according to MSTR Tracker. Top-Performing Stock in 2024 MicroStrategy’s stock performance has outpaced Bitcoin itself, rising more than 475% year-to-date. This makes it one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500, based on data from Google Finance and Slickcharts. As of Dec. 5, MSTR has a market capitalization of approximately $92 billion, more than twice the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Benchmark fintech analyst Mark Palmer raised his price target for MSTR shares from $450 to $650, citing the company’s aggressive buying strategy. Currently, MSTR trades at about $394 per share, according to Google Finance. Expanding Bitcoin Holdings During its Aug. 1 earnings call, MicroStrategy introduced the concept of “Bitcoin yield,” a metric that tracks BTC holdings relative to outstanding shares. The company committed to a massive three-year BTC buying spree, dubbed the “21/21 Plan,” aiming to raise $21 billion each in equity and debt to fund the effort. Despite criticism, analysts note that MicroStrategy’s bold strategy has delivered exceptional returns for its shareholders. “The dramatic impact on the company’s share price has provided ample justification, as its stock has outperformed almost every large company in the US during the past four-plus years,” said Palmer.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS.

But its DeFi ecosystem is trending up and to the right, creating an opening for one of its biggest protocols to capitalize.  Suilend, which facilitates crypto borrowing and lending on Sui, raised $2 million in February and just closed on an additional $4 million, its pseudonymous founder Rooter told CoinDesk. The funding trove will allow Suilend to weather potential market shifts, he said.  ""It's the time to do it and make sure that we have capital to last for the next four years, if there's a long bear market,"" Rooter said.  The latest round was led by Tarun Chitra's Robot Ventures with participation from a bevy of venture firms and angel investors. It comes days ahead of Suilend's debut of a new token, called SAVE.  Suilend is the chain's second-largest DeFi protocol by total value locked, or TVL, as measured by DefiLlama, and its biggest lending protocol, with nearly $470 million of TVL. Its 30-day revenue of nearly $820,000 also places it among the chain's top earners.  Those numbers aren't much when compared to the top venues on other ecosystems on fast and cheap layer-1 blockchains like Solana, where Suilend has its roots. An associated lending protocol on Solana called Save (formerly Solend, once Solana's top lending protocol) has accrued $500,000 in monthly revenue off $450 million of TVL.  But Rooter isn't concerned with Sui's current ranking against Solana. He's an evangelist for Sui's relative upsides that could eventually give it a greater capture of the market. For example, he's found that software developments can proceed ""a few times faster"" on Sui.  ""We're actually able to ship more"" on Sui, Rooter said, pointing to a recently launched liquid staking token project and automated market maker that will soon join its core lending suite.  Suilend's LST design is informed by the missteps Rooter and Solend endured firsthand. Its ""infinitely liquid"" design means holders don't wait through unstaking delays to unlock the tokens underlying their LST, he said. Issues with a Solana LST’s multi-day unlock once caused chaos at Solend.

37263843,https://thecoinrise.com/binance-labs-ends-its-role-in-gmt-project-what-happened/,1733430811,Binance Labs Ends Its Role in GMT Project: What Happened?,"Binance Labs has just made a bold move that has left the crypto community buzzing. The lab has transferred its remaining 30 million GMT tokens, valued at $7.29 million, to Binance. This action, revealed by Etherscan, effectively ended its involvement with the project. This event follows a series of unlocked tokens totaling 75 million GMT, purchased at an average price of $0.214 per token. With a total value of $16.05 million, this move raises eyebrows about what it means for the token’s future and the platform’s trajectory. Binance’s Exit: A Critical Shift in GMT’s Ecosystem Binance Labs is known to take positions in top crypto projects . However, the firm’s departure from the GMT project marks the end of a significant partnership. The lab’s original investment, which acquired 75 million GMT tokens, has now been fully liquidated to Binance. While the price of GMT at the time of the transfer hovered around $0.214, the token now trades at $0.2563. This signals some stability despite minor fluctuations. Given Binance’s status as the largest exchange in the industry, traders are now fixated on whether Binance will sell or hold these tokens. Large token transfers often signal behind-the-scenes strategic decisions, which crypto investors closely monitor. These moves generate significant speculation as traders attempt to decode the intentions behind them. This shift could have profound implications for GMT’s price and long-term market trajectory. GMT’s Price: Impact of the Transfer GMT was valued at about $0.214 per token at the time of the transfer, a slight dip from its earlier price point. Currently, GMT is trading at $0.2463, with a 5.14% drop in the last 24 hours. GMT has shown remarkable growth over the past month despite this recent decline. The token has surged by 112% and 26% in the last week alone. However, the recent transfer and the future actions of Binance could play a pivotal role in the token’s price movements. GMT’s Role in Move-to-Earn Concept GMT is not just a token; it serves multiple purposes within the platform’s ecosystem. As Stepn blockchain ’s native token, GMT is used for governance, staking, and purchasing in-game assets like sneaker NFTs. It is also integrated into the platform’s burn mechanism, which helps manage the token supply. The community’s continued involvement with these features is vital for sustaining the token’s market presence and value. Yet, the recent change in Binance Labs’ involvement could signal a project lifecycle shift. This shift was showcased when it backed five projects in September.

37263743,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=657860,1733430625,SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week?,"SUI trades at crucial supply levels, sparking intense speculation among traders and analysts about its next move. After recently reaching a new all-time high (ATH), the price failed to sustain above its previous ATH, raising concerns about whether this was a genuine breakout or merely a fakeout. The current price action has left market participants waiting for confirmation as bulls attempt to reclaim dominance. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is ‘Ready To Run Again’ – Analyst Expects 60% Rally Renowned analyst and investor Carl Runefelt has shared a bullish outlook for SUI, predicting an imminent breakout. According to his analysis, a successful push above the current supply levels could trigger a rally toward $4.20 in the coming days—or potentially within hours. Runefelt’s perspective adds confidence to the market sentiment, suggesting that SUI still holds the potential to reclaim its upward trajectory despite recent setbacks. The coming days are crucial for SUI as traders monitor whether bulls can overcome the key resistance levels. A decisive breakout could solidify SUI’s position as one of the most promising assets in the crypto market. At the same time, a failure to do so might result in prolonged consolidation or a deeper pullback. All eyes remain on the $4.20 target and SUI’s bullish momentum. SUI Only 5% Away From ATH SUI recently surged to a new all-time high (ATH) but failed to hold above the previous ATH of $4.05 set on November 17. Despite this brief pullback, the price action indicates that SUI remains poised to reclaim and surpass its ATH, with analysts and investors expecting significant upside momentum shortly. Top analyst Carl Runefelt provided a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting that SUI recently broke out of a 4-hour symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling bullish momentum. SUI trades within a bullish flag formation, a classic continuation pattern often preceding substantial price rallies. Runefelt has set a price target of $4.20 in the coming hours, which he believes could act as the next major resistance before SUI establishes new highs. The broader market environment adds further confidence to this bullish outlook. With strong momentum, Bitcoin’s breakout above the $100K level has historically triggered altcoin rallies as liquidity flows from BTC into smaller assets. This dynamic positions SUI for a potential surge as it benefits from heightened interest across the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: $1.87B Bitcoin Withdrawals From Coinbase In 24H – What This Means To Price While the short-term outlook for SUI appears bullish, the price must break and hold above its previous ATH to confirm sustained upward momentum. All eyes are on $4.20 as traders await the next move in SUI’s exciting rally. Price Discovery Rally Or Settling Correction? SUI is trading at $3.83 after briefly breaking its all-time high (ATH) but retracing over 6% from the recent peak. Despite the pullback, the price remains within striking distance of key resistance levels that could determine its next move. If SUI breaks above $3.88 and successfully reclaims the November 17 ATH at $3.94 as support, it will likely trigger another breakout, setting the stage for a price discovery rally. Reclaiming and holding these levels would signal strong bullish momentum, potentially driving SUI into uncharted territory as buyers fuel the next leg of its rally. Such a scenario would align with the broader market sentiment following Bitcoin’s recent rally above $100K, which has historically increased demand for altcoins. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Keep Buying – DOGE Metrics Reveal Demand Remains Strong However, there is a risk if SUI fails to break above $3.88 and $3.94 in the near term. A rejection at these levels could result in continued consolidation as the price struggles to find direction. This would likely keep SUI trading within a range, frustrating bulls seeking a breakout. Worse, a failure to maintain support could lead to a deeper correction, testing lower demand zones and cooling market enthusiasm.

He posted an enigmatic image on X (formerly Twitter) after three months of silence. Within hours, GameStop (GME), the stock synonymous with Gill’s meteoric rise to fame, surged 8%, triggering a trading halt due to the intense volatility. As always, retail investors, meme stock enthusiasts, and crypto circles alike are dissecting the post, searching for meaning behind the cryptic visual. The image , styled like a TIME magazine cover, features a blank computer screen with a paused video. The video’s progress bar reads “01:09 / 04:20.” Many believe it could be a hint at a YouTube livestream in the near future. pic.twitter.com/tXViICmVFG — Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) December 5, 2024 Kitty’s legendary legacy Keith Gill became a household name in January 2021, leading the charge in the GameStop short squeeze that rattled Wall Street to its core. Posting under the moniker Roaring Kitty on YouTube and Reddit, Gill detailed his investment thesis on GME, encouraging retail traders to buy into the heavily shorted stock. His early investment of $53,000 in GameStop shares ballooned into an astonishing $48 million during the height of the squeeze. GameStop’s stock soared over 1,000% at its peak, leaving hedge funds like Melvin Capital reeling with billions in losses. Kitty’s passion for the stock made him a symbol of retail investor power and a thorn in Wall Street’s side. His influence outlasted the initial frenzy, maintaining momentum for meme stocks even after stepping away from the spotlight in 2021. Earlier this year, he returned briefly in May and June, driving up GameStop’s stock price and confirming his continued stake in the company. At that time, he revealed holdings of 9 million shares valued at $262 million, cementing his ongoing commitment to the movement. Trading halts are nothing new for GME where Keith is involved. Earlier this year, during a livestream where he showcased his massive holdings, the stock experienced similar fluctuations, with trading paused multiple times. Investors are now eyeing GameStop’s upcoming earnings report, set for December 10, with analysts forecasting a $0.03 loss per share. The company has beaten estimates in recent quarters. Kitty’s return coincides with Bitcoin’s historic breakthrough, crossing $100,000 for the first time ever. The crypto community, which shares strong ties with the meme stock movement, is riding super high right now. Both phenomena represent the power of decentralized movements and retail investors taking control. With global stocks also rallying, the timing of Gill’s post feels like a deliberate alignment with the broader bullish sentiment. 2024 really has been one for the books!

37263734,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51438,1733429748,Best Meme Coins to Buy Before 2025: BTFD Presale Sells 23 Billion Coins in 10 Days While Brett and Moo Deng Surge with Coinbase Effect,"What would you do if you had the chance to invest in a meme coin that could multiply your investment tenfold in just a few weeks? That’s the reality staring crypto enthusiasts in the face of BTFD Coin (BTFD) dominating the meme coin market with Brett and Moo Deng. With presale records smashed and Coinbase effects fuelling momentum, these coins are at the centre of a booming trend. BTFD Coin, with its presale already raising over $1 million in just 10 days, is setting a new standard for meme coins. Brett has cemented its reputation as a meme coin powerhouse on the Base blockchain, and Moo Deng’s explosive price movements continue to turn heads. If you’re searching for the best meme coins to buy before 2025, these three deserve your attention. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Dip That Keeps Giving BTFD Coin, short for “ Buy The F***ing Dip ,” is turning heads with its presale success. Launched on November 26, 2024, this Ethereum-based coin has sold over 23 billion tokens in just 10 days, raising more than $1 million and attracting 2,400 bullish investors. Currently in its 7th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.000064, and the buzz around its potential makes it one of the best meme coins to buy before 2025. Let’s break down the numbers. A $1,000 investment in Stage 7 buys 15,625,000 BTFD tokens. When the presale ends at a listing price of $0.0006, your investment could grow to $9,375—a nearly 9x return. It’s no wonder the BTFD community is growing exponentially, with buyers snapping up tokens faster than you can say “moonshot.” BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its price. With a play-to-earn (P2E) game launching soon and staking rewards averaging 90% APY, this coin is not just about quick flips—it’s about long-term value. The community-driven approach ensures that every dip is an opportunity, making it a standout in the meme coin market. For those ready to dive in, here’s what you can buy with popular cryptocurrencies: 57,581,093 BTFD tokens for 1 Ethereum. 1,506,375,000 BTFD tokens for 1 Bitcoin. 3,742,656 BTFD tokens for 1 Solana. With its revolutionary approach to meme coin investing , BTFD is a must-watch. As analysts predict a strong bull run, this could be your chance to ride the wave with one of the best meme coins to buy before 2025. Brett (BRETT): Coinbase’s Favourite Meme Coin Brett, a meme coin operating on Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 Base blockchain, has captured the market’s attention. Trading at $0.202956, Brett has seen a 140% increase in the past month, catapulting its market cap to $1.95 billion. This rise positions Brett as a top choice for those hunting for the best meme coins to buy before 2025. Coinbase’s roadmap inclusion has been a game-changer. Though trading and transfers aren’t yet live, the announcement spiked investor interest and trading volumes. Dubbed the “Coinbase effect,” this phenomenon often results in significant price surges, and Brett is no exception. Long-term projections are optimistic, with analysts forecasting a potential price of $3.70 by 2030. Brett’s journey hasn’t been entirely smooth. Concerns over insider holdings caused a 47% price drop earlier in 2024, but the coin has rebounded stronger than ever. Listings on major exchanges like KuCoin and Uphold have solidified its place in the meme coin hierarchy. As the Base blockchain ecosystem grows, Brett’s integration within this network positions it as a meme coin with serious potential. If you’re looking for the best meme coins to buy before 2025, Brett deserves a spot on your radar. Moo Deng (MOODENG): The Meme Coin That Won’t Be Tamed Moo Deng, inspired by a viral pygmy hippo, is creating ripples in the meme coin space. Its latest price surge, fuelled by Coinbase’s roadmap inclusion, saw an 80% spike within an hour, taking the token to $0.57. With a market cap approaching $500 million, Moo Deng is just 16% away from reclaiming its all-time high of $0.68. The “Coinbase effect” struck again, boosting investor confidence and driving trading volumes up by 400% to $751 million. This isn’t Moo Deng’s first big moment. In October 2024, Binance listed the token, triggering a 200% rally from $0.08 to $0.23. These movements underscore Moo Deng’s potential as one of the best meme coins to buy before 2025. However, Moo Deng isn’t without challenges. Liquidity remains an issue, with only $81,000 in resting orders within a 2% price range on OKX. This makes large sell-offs tricky, but its Solana-based infrastructure ensures efficiency and scalability, attracting traders despite the risks. Moo Deng’s speculative allure makes it a perfect choice for risk-tolerant investors. Its price history and market momentum suggest that this coin could soar higher, making it a must-consider for anyone exploring the best meme coins to buy before 2025. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on These Meme Coin Gems From our research and market insights, it’s clear that BTFD Coin, Brett, and Moo Deng are the best meme coins to buy before 2025. Each brings something unique to the table, but BTFD is the best among all with its record-breaking presale and community-driven strategy. While Brett with its Coinbase-backed momentum, and Moo Deng with its explosive price movements. Time is ticking, and opportunities like this don’t last forever. Join the BTFD Coin presale today to secure your spot in one of the most exciting crypto movements of the year. With a P2E game, staking rewards, and a growing community, BTFD is your ticket to riding the next big wave in meme coins.

Why Not Join BTFD Coin When It’s Ready to Take Top Flight?,"Meme coins have gone from being internet jokes to serious wealth generators, and let’s be real—they’ve had a wild ride. Dogecoin, the OG meme coin, started as a playful jab at Bitcoin, only to skyrocket to mainstream fame thanks to its dog mascot and celebrity shoutouts. These days, everyone and their grandma knows what Dogecoin is, but here’s the thing: the meme coin craze is far from over. In fact, a new player, BTFD Coin (BTFD) , is stepping onto the stage, and it’s got something Dogecoin didn’t have early on—a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, juicy staking rewards, and a pumped-up community squad ready to take it to the moon. If you’ve ever thought, “Man, I wish I got in on Dogecoin when it was a fraction of a cent,” this might be your second chance. BTFD Coin is still in presale, which means early adopters are getting a sweet deal. With over $1 million raised in less than 10 days and 23 billion coins already sold, this token is making serious waves. And it’s not just about FOMO—BTFD is bringing something fresh to the meme coin world. Let’s dive into why this is one of the Best New Meme Coins Right Now . BTFD Coin: The New Meme King in the Making BTFD Coin isn’t just another token trying to cash in on meme coin hype. It’s bringing real value to the table, combining the fun of meme culture with cutting-edge utility. First, let’s talk about its P2E game. Imagine earning crypto just by playing a game—whether you’re battling it out in their upcoming Bulls Squad arena or completing daily missions. This isn’t just a way to have fun; it’s a way to make money. The game’s rewards are directly tied to the BTFD ecosystem , so the more players join, the more valuable the token becomes. And then there’s staking. For those who want their money to work while they sleep, BTFD offers an impressive Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for staking your coins. Not only do you get to earn passive income, but you’re also contributing to the stability of the token’s ecosystem. That’s a win-win. The hype around BTFD Coin isn’t just marketing fluff. Analysts are calling this one of the Best New Meme Coins Right Now, predicting explosive growth as it gains traction. The presale, now in its 7th stage, started at $0.000004 per coin and has already surged to $0.000064. With 23 billion coins sold and over 2,400 holders onboard, it’s clear this isn’t just another flash in the pan. Let’s crunch some numbers. If you were to invest $25,000 at the current presale price of $0.000064, you’d snag 390,625,000 coins. By the time the presale ends at $0.0006, your investment will likely soar to $234,375. That’s nearly 10X your money before the token even hits public exchanges. Think about that for a second. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Started It All Dogecoin didn’t start as a serious investment opportunity. Back in 2013, it was all about laughs—a coin with a Shiba Inu mascot and a community that thrived on internet jokes. But something funny happened: Dogecoin grew up. Thanks to high-profile supporters like Elon Musk and a die-hard community, Dogecoin became a symbol of crypto’s playful side while proving it could hold its own in the market. By 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared to an all-time high of $0.74, creating millionaires practically overnight. People who bought in for fractions of a penny were suddenly rolling in cash, and Dogecoin was no longer a punchline. It became a gateway for crypto newcomers and a staple in meme coin culture. But here’s the thing: Dogecoin didn’t have the kind of utility that BTFD Coin is bringing to the table. There were no P2E games or staking rewards—just pure community power and hype. Dogecoin’s current value hovers well below its peak, but its place in the crypto world is solid. It paved the way for coins like BTFD, proving that memes, community, and a little innovation can lead to exponential returns. If you missed the Dogecoin train early on, it’s worth asking: why not hop on BTFD while it’s still at the station? Why BTFD Coin Could Be Your Next Big Move So, why is BTFD one of the Best New Meme Coins Right Now? It’s simple: it’s not just riding the meme coin wave —it’s steering the ship. With a P2E game that incentivises engagement, staking rewards that offer passive income, and a vibrant Bulls Squad community driving its growth, BTFD is redefining what it means to be a meme coin. The presale numbers speak for themselves. Reaching the 7th stage in just 10 days is no small feat, especially with over $1 million raised and counting. And with a total of 16 stages, there’s still time to get in early—but not much. The clock’s ticking, and as the price climbs with each stage, the opportunity for exponential returns narrows. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newbie, BTFD Coin offers a chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next Dogecoin—or even better. Imagine a world where you didn’t just read about crypto success stories but became one yourself. That’s the kind of potential we’re talking about here. How to Make the Most of This Amazing Wealth-Generation Opportunity If you’ve ever wished you had invested in Dogecoin back when it was a fraction of a cent, here’s your second chance. BTFD Coin is more than just another meme coin—it’s a community-driven powerhouse with real utility, exciting rewards, and the kind of growth potential that turns dreams into reality. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Join the BTFD Coin presale now , secure your stake, and get ready to ride the wave to exponential returns. Whether you’re in it for the staking rewards, the P2E action, or the chance to be part of a revolutionary new meme coin, BTFD is ready to take flight. The question is, are you?

The company made the announcement on December 5 via an X post, outlining that the primary use of the proceeds will be to acquire additional Bitcoin and repurchase some of its outstanding convertible notes due in 2026. MARA’s Latest Convertible Notes Offering In an accompanying press release , MARA confirmed that the notes will be issued with no interest, except in rare cases where special interest may apply with the principal amount expected to remain unchanged. The notes are set to mature in 2031 and are convertible at the company’s discretion into cash, common stock shares, or a combination of both. The Bitcoin miner projects that the net proceeds from this offering will amount to approximately $835 million, with the potential to increase to $985 million should additional notes be fully purchased. The company plans to allocate roughly $48 million of these proceeds to repurchase approximately $51 million of its existing convertible notes, which are due in 2026. The remaining returns will be used for acquiring more Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, strategic acquisitions, expansion of assets, and debt repayment. Previous Offerings and Purchases This move follows MARA’s previous $700 million zero-interest convertible senior notes offering due in 2030. The company also recently acquired 703 BTC in November after earlier buying 5,771 BTC, which brought its total monthly acquisitions to 6,474 BTC. The purchase was made after a previous zero-interest convertible senior note sale that raised $1 billion. At the time, the mining company also revealed it has approximately $160 million in remaining funds, which it plans to use for future Bitcoin buys during price dips. As of the latest update, BitcoinTreasuries shows that MARA now holds a total of 34,794 BTC, valued at approximately $3.3 billion. This positions the company as the second-largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, behind only MicroStrategy, which recently announced a purchase of $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. The market has responded positively to the firm’s latest moves. Google Finance data shows that on December 5, the company’s stock closed up 3.30%, reaching $25.96. Additionally, over the past month, MARA’s stock price has surged by 59.85%, and its year-to-date growth stands at 13.2%.

37263564,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623495,1733429419,Meta turns to nuclear energy to power its AI data centers,"Meta platforms has joined other tech giants in the quest for nuclear energy to support its high energy-consuming data centers. The Mark Zuckerberg-led technology giant sent out a request for proposals this week to find nuclear developers to support its AI innovation and sustainability objectives. Meta wants an all-rounder nuclear developer Meta, based in California and runs social media giants Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, aims for nuclear generation capacity in the US of between one and four gigawatts. The company has acknowledged the need for a sustainable energy supply to keep the world connected and maintain innovations. “Advancing the technologies that will build the future of human connection, including the next wave of AI innovation requires electric grids to expand and embrace new sources of reliable, clean and renewable energy.” Meta. The goal for Meta is to sign a deal with a nuclear developer who is capable of permitting, designing, engineering, financing, constructing, and operating the power plants. According to their blog post , the company is taking an open approach with its request to enable partnerships across the industry. The social media giant also told interested parties to complete an initial qualification intake by January 3 and to submit a full RFP proposal by February 7. Meta also added: “We believe that nuclear energy can help provide firm baseload power to support the growth needs of the electric grids that power both our data centers, as well as the communities around them.” Data centers are the physical infrastructure on which platforms operate. Meta believes that nuclear energy will play a pivotal role in the transition to a cleaner, more reliable, and diversified electric grid. The technology company for more than a decade now has been investing in wind, geothermal, battery storage, and solar energy but looks to expand its scope. It feels the expansion to nuclear power will guarantee them even more power. Meta is targeting 4 gigawatts in the early 2030s Looking at having up to four gigawatts of nuclear capacity by the early 2030s, the company will have enough energy to reach material cost reductions by developing multiple units. “Nuclear energy projects are more capital intensive, take longer to develop, are subject to more regulatory requirements and have longer expected operational life,” the technology company added. According to Meta, the said differences mean they have to engage nuclear projects earlier in their development life cycle and consider their operational requirements when designing a contract. The nuclear proposals come as the technology company this week revealed plans to construct a $10 billion, 1,500MW data center in northeast Louisianna in order to support its AI efforts. The 4 million square foot facility at its largest point extends more than one mile from front to back. The data center is said to be the biggest of all Meta facilities and will be run on natural gas. Since 2020 , Meta has been matching its entire annual electricity usage with new renewable energy and the company is promising to match the data center’s electricity use with 100 percent clean renewable energy. “Going forward, this commitment is more important than ever to support our vision of operating sustainably.” Meta. “As our sector continues to grow we are committed to working across industry to advance our sustainability commitments and transform the grid of the future,” the company added. by going nuclear, Meta is joining other tech giants in turning to the energy source in order to power their data centers. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have also announced plans for nuclear generation to support their energy-hungry infrastructure with base load power that is clean and reliable.

To read full editions, subscribe . It seems fitting that bitcoin’s rise above $103,000 came in the final month of a groundbreaking year for the asset. You already know about the first US spot bitcoin ETFs in January and Trump’s election win a month ago. Then there was the president-elect’s selection this week of Paul Atkins as SEC chair (who many deem to be a crypto advocate ). And Fed Chair Jerome Powell even recently compared bitcoin to gold . The fact that gold’s market cap is still nine times larger than bitcoin’s (about $18T to $2T) “should offer additional insight into how much more room there is for bitcoin to grow from current levels,” LMAX Group market strategist Joel Kruger said in an email. Momentum driving BTC past the psychological six-figure price mark can beget more momentum — albeit not without volatility. “It not only validates the long-term belief of the community but also signals to institutions, corporations, sovereign funds, skeptics and sidelined investors alike that bitcoin has entered a new phase of adoption and recognition as a store of value and a transformative asset class,” according to 21Shares crypto research strategist Matt Mena. Bitcoin had dipped to about $99,000 by 3 pm ET on Thursday. A key next target is $110,000, Mena added, citing Deribit data that shows the majority of Jan. 31, 2025 call option contract volume is concentrated at that price level. Industry watchers have also pointed to BTC’s history of price swings to temper mania from the most bullish of bulls. After the early years of bitcoin, the road to $100,000 included a rise to $18,000 in 2017 followed by a plummet to around $4,000 the following year. A surge to nearly $70,000 in late-2021 was followed by a severe downward move to $16,000 in 2022. While optimism is high that the Trump Administration and a crypto-friendly Congress will help spur crypto regulatory and legislative clarity , Nansen principal research analyst Aurelie Barthere said those might not pan out as expected. He said: “Once we witness the first policies and decisions from the Trump Administration in January, there could be some risk of disappointed expectations, especially if the agenda prioritizes tariff and immigration-related policies first.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

This positive outlook for XRP is potentially driven by bullish price action, rising interest from whales and traders, and significant withdrawals from exchanges. XRP’s Price Momentum Despite this bullish outlook, XRP has registered a price drop of 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading near $2.40. Meanwhile, interest from whales and traders has resulted in a 12% rise in trading volume during the same period, along with a significant withdrawal of tokens from exchanges, as reported by an on-chain analytics firm. $315 Million XRP Outflow According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass , XRP spot inflow/outflow data shows that exchanges across the cryptocurrency market have witnessed a significant $315 million worth of XRP outflow. Source: Coinglass The technical term “outflow” in cryptocurrency refers to the flow of assets from exchanges to wallets, indicating a potential buying opportunity, reducing selling pressure, and suggesting a possible upside rally in the coming days. The last time exchanges witnessed a notable inflow, XRP’s price dropped by 20%. Now, it’s happening in the opposite direction, hinting at a potential upside rally. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XRP recently broke out from a descending trendline but is currently struggling to rally due to strong resistance near the $2.45 level. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if the altcoin breaches and closes a daily candle above the $2.45 level, there is a strong possibility that XRP could soar by 18% to reach the $2.90 level in the coming days.

Trump Rescues USA (TRUMPUSA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rescues USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rescues USA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rescues USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rescues USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rescues USA by entering its contract address – AtFkLTsTBq8QYtgfuyPBDwjzWFzFtCPhGnHBweSB7mr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPUSA.

37263220,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623483,1733428244,$5.5 billion AI startup Cohere pushing to build customized models for enterprise clients,"Cohere, the Canadian artificial intelligence startup valued at $5.5 billion is pivoting toward creating specialized AI models for enterprise use. The company’s move steps away from the traditional large models most of its competitors are currently invested in. Cohere’s co-founder, Nick Frosst emphasized that today’s businesses need models designed for specific tasks rather than generic, all-encompassing ones. The strategic shift to building customized models comes as a result of companies seeing diminishing returns from their larger models. The problem of diminishing returns from scaling AI models Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, mentioned that the gains from training AI models on large data sets have plateaued. Companies now face delays in the training and deployment of new generations of large language models. The industry, which initially saw breakthroughs by throwing computational power and resources at larger models, has started to recognize that size is not always synonymous with quality or utility. In a letter to its investors, Cohere says this new direction is a result of companies struggling to incorporate AI into their daily work. Instead of pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI), which some companies like OpenAI see as the future of AI, Cohere is taking a more targeted approach. The company aims to achieve greater capital efficiency by optimizing existing models for real-world applications. “We’re going to work with enterprises to make models perfect for their use case, tailor them to their specific needs, and bring them to production,” Frosst said. He was clear that Cohere would not rely on the notion that AGI is just around the corner, emphasizing that increasing model size doesn’t equate to better results. The race to build better models The race to build large and better AI models has led to a boom in investment and development across the sector. Cohere recently raised $270 million in a Series C financing, while competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI labs have raised billions of dollars to fund the capital-intensive process of developing frontier AI systems, which often require enormous amounts of computational power. According to Cohere, it shifted from building larger models to custom models due to diminishing returns alongside feedback it received from customers. “What we’re hearing from customers is that they don’t just need bigger models to be good at everything. They need models that are actually built for their specific use cases,” Frosst said. Cohere will be deploying customized versions of existing models that can provide direct value to businesses. Its models will be designed to understand and execute highly specific tasks tailored to each enterprise’s requirements, in contrast to the generalized capabilities often found in larger models. Cohere’s new approach may also align with industry trends in sustainability and cost efficiency. With governments increasingly scrutinizing the carbon footprint of tech companies, Cohere’s strategy could offer an edge in navigating the evolving regulatory landscape . Developing enormous AI models is not just an expensive business; it is also energy-intensive. AI firms may need more energy-efficient techniques to better position themselves to comply with future regulations as governments push for lower emissions and understand the technology better.

Over $135 million in shorts were liquidated in the past 24 hours per Coinglass data, Bitcoin’s rally to $104,000 has added nearly 12% in open interest and 125% in options trading volume. Traders are consistently taking profits in Bitcoin, and this supports the capital rotation thesis. Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant argues this cycle is different from previous ones. Institutional investors buying Bitcoin have no interest in rotating into altcoins, and this implies that altcoin price rallies rely on an influx of capital from retail traders across crypto exchange platforms. Traders need to watch exchange user activity and the altcoin market capitalization chart to determine the top cycle for altcoins this season. The total crypto market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin, is still 8.5% below its 2021 cycle top of $1.71 trillion. As retail traders inject capital into crypto exchanges, the market cap is expected to climb past $1.57 trillion.

37262817,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311668,1733427916,"Crypto Giant Grayscale Seeking To Convert Its Solana Trust Into ETF, According to New Filing","Leading crypto asset manager Grayscale just submitted a 19b-4 filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Solana Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund. The Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary’s Solana Trust is currently the largest Solana investment fund by assets under management (AUM). It manages $134.2 million worth of SOL , roughly 0.1% of all Solana in circulation. Grayscale says it is seeking to list the Solana Trust as an ETF so it can closely track the value of the underlying crypto asset. “The Sponsor thus believes that allowing Shares of the Trust to list and trade on the Exchange as an ETP (i.e., converting the Trust to a spot SOL ETP) would provide other investors with a safe and secure way to invest in SOL on a regulated national securities exchange.” The development comes as other asset managers also file applications to offer Solana ETFs to their customers. Investment giant VanEck submitted an S-1 registration statement to the SEC in June, making it the first company in the US to apply for a SOL ETF. Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, said at the time that the filing was a bet that Donald Trump would win the presidential election. Other firms seeking approval to launch a Solana ETF include 21Shares, Canary Capital and Bitwise.

37262816,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311791,1733427863,Metaplex Protocol Achieves Record-Breaking Protocol Fees in November 2024,"December 5, 2024 – Cayman Islands, Cayman Islands Metaplex – the blockchain protocol used to create virtually every token, memecoin and NFT on Solana – s aw record-breaking protocol fees in November 2024, fueled by a surge in digital asset creation on Solana. Rise in Solana token creation drives record protocol growth As the protocol behind virtually all token creation on Solana, Metaplex has emerged as a primary beneficiary of the extraordinary surge in digital asset creation on the Solana network. This exponential level of activity – encompassing everything from memecoins to AI tokens and NFTs – directly contributes to Metaplex’s protocol fees. This increased protocol fee generation has in turn funded record-breaking $MPLX token purchases for the Metaplex DAO. Since June 2024, 50% of the prior month’s protocol fees and a portion of the historical fees have been allocated to funding MPLX token purchases for contribution to the DAO. In November 2024, this culminated in 12,000 SOL worth of MPLX purchases – e quivalent to approximately $3 million at current prices – m arking a substantial 58% increase month-over-month and signifying the largest monthly MPLX token purchases to date. Building on this momentum, Metaplex’s November protocol fees hit an ATH (all-time high) of $3.5 million, setting the stage for even larger allocations for MPLX purchases in December. Record-breaking Metaplex Protocol metrics in November November’s protocol activity shattered previous records across multiple metrics. Metaplex saw extraordinary growth in fungible token creation, with 1.4 million new tokens minted – marking a 56% increase month-over-month compared to the previous ATH in October 2024 and a new monthly record. This represented 94% of all token metadata assets created, driven primarily by memecoin activity on platforms such as Pump.fun. Metaplex Core – the next-generation NFT standard – demonstrated significant adoption with a new ATH of 354,000 assets created, driven by expanded use cases made possible due to the standard’s flexible design. User engagement metrics surged as the number of unique wallets interacting with the Metaplex Protocol reached 879,000 – a 34% increase from October and a new ATH. The protocol’s total collector base expanded to nearly 60 million unique wallets, growing by over 860,000 in November alone. About the Metaplex Protocol Metaplex is the leading decentralized protocol on Solana and SVM, providing tools and programs for developers and creators to build DApps (decentralized applications) that use digital assets. With a growing user base and a commitment to innovation, Metaplex is empowering the next wave of DeFi (decentralized finance) and commerce. About the Metaplex Foundation The Metaplex Foundation is a Cayman Islands non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the development and growth of the Metaplex Protocol. By providing open-source tools and resources, the foundation empowers developers, creators and users worldwide to participate in a decentralized and inclusive digital economy.

37263268,https://invezz.com/?p=2371246,1733427787,XRP on-chain metrics show bulls still in control despite the price correction,"XRP has experienced significant volatility in recent days after a dramatic rally in November with its price retreating from recent highs. However, while the XRP price correction is concerning, on-chain metrics suggest that bulls are still in control. What’s behind the XRP pullback? XRP’s price has experienced a sharp 25% drop since reaching a multi-year high of $2.90 in early December 2024, trading at $2.30 as of December 5. As XRP’s price dropped, its market capitalization fell by 8%, slipping below Tether USD to fourth place. This correction comes after a remarkable rally, where XRP surged by over 400% following the election of President Donald Trump. The appointment of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair also added fuel to this surge, as market sentiment grew bullish on the expectation of a crypto-friendly SEC leadership. However, traders are currently taking the opportunity to lock in profits, contributing to the recent pullback. This decline is part of a broader correction that has affected several altcoins, diverging from Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000. Despite this, the drop could be a healthy market correction, as opposed to a full trend reversal, considering XRP’s strong performance earlier in the year. On-chain metrics suggest continued bullish sentiment While the short-term price correction may cause concern, on-chain data presents a more optimistic picture for XRP. One crucial metric supporting bullish sentiment is the stability of XRP’s funding rate. According to Coinglass data , XRP’s funding rate has increased immensely to levels seen during XRP’s rally in February 2024 and March 2021. Source: Coinglass This surge suggests that the market is not overly bullish, reducing the risk of an overheated rally, while still providing room for further growth. Moreover, XRP’s weighted sentiment remains low compared to previous rallies, indicating that retail traders are not the primary drivers of this latest surge. This suggests that the current holders are more confident in the long-term prospects of the token, reducing the chances of a significant sell-off during market downturns. Source: Santiment These on-chain indicators suggest that the recent decline may be more of a temporary pullback rather than a sign of an impending trend reversal. Technical indicators point toward a bullish reversal From a technical analysis perspective, XRP’s price is showing signs of potential upside despite the recent pullback. A bull flag pattern has formed on the 4-hour chart, indicating that a bullish continuation may be in the cards once the price closes above the $2.37 resistance level. If this pattern resolves positively, XRP’s price could see a surge towards $4.83, a new all-time high, marking a 60% increase from current levels. Source: TradingView However, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped from overbought conditions, which may indicate further price consolidation or a temporary dip. The RSI’s decline from 82 to 52 between December 3 and December 5 suggests a potential for a deeper pullback, but as long as XRP’s price holds above key support levels at $2.05 and $1.68, the bulls may quickly reclaim control. Going by the technical analysis, the correction is possibly providing an opportunity for consolidation before another potential breakout, supported by strong market sentiment and solid technical foundations.

According to a new report by AP News, Trump has picked former SEC Commissioner and current Patomak Partners chief executive Paul Atkins to head the regulatory agency. As stated by Trump on Truth social media, according to AP, “[Atkins] believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, and that provide capital to make our economy the best in the world. He also recognizes that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to making America greater than ever before.” Furthermore, Trump said that he is a “proven leader for common sense regulations.” Atkins will replace Gary Gensler as Chairman of the SEC. Gensler, who stepped down from this position last month, is known for his hardline stance on crypto assets as under his helm, the SEC took several high-profile enforcement actions against prominent crypto firms, including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Ripple Labs. After his tenure as a Commissioner of the SEC from 2002-2008, Atkins has opined that there is too much market regulation, according to the report. In 2022, while at Patomak, Atkins penned a letter noting that as Americans are becoming more familiar with crypto assets, they may become interested in purchasing them for their retirement plans. News of the announcement sent the top crypto asset by market cap flying, as BTC went from a low of $94,890 on December 4th to a peak of $103,425, a new all-time high. It has since stabilized and is trading for $101,194 at time of writing, a 6.5% gain on the day.

However, according to Bitfinex’s head of derivatives, Jag Kooner, the reverse could introduce “downward pressure” on BTC. A robust jobs report could lead the Federal Reserve to reconsider the pace of interest rate cuts, potentially opting for a more gradual approach. This scenario might strengthen the U.S. dollar and apply downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a weaker-than-expected report could bolster expectations for more aggressive rate cuts, potentially enhancing liquidity and positively impacting the crypto market. Jag Kooner, Bitfinex’s head of derivatives Cautious Bitcoin optimism Amid looming economic data, B2BINPAY CEO Arthur Azizov argued that BTC was due for a market correction, especially after breaking the $100,000 psychological barrier. Azizov remarked that retracing below $90,000 would be healthy for BTC, given its 54% surge following Donald Trump’s re-election. It’s reasonable to conclude that a pullback is likely imminent—it’s just a matter of time. By year-end, I believe Bitcoin’s price will consolidate around $100,000 before retracing to five-digit levels, potentially settling near $85,000 in the following months.

37274428,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107296,1733427607,U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs Record $165.5 Million in Net Inflows on December 4,"The U.S. cryptocurrency market saw a significant milestone as spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $165.5 million in net inflows on December 4, 2024. This marked the eighth consecutive day of positive inflows, signaling growing investor confidence in Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds. According to data from Farside Investors and a Tree News post on X (formerly Twitter), major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale led the charge. This development highlights the increasing adoption of Ethereum ETFs as a vehicle for institutional and retail investment. Spot Ethereum ETFs: Breaking Down the Numbers The $165.5 million in net inflows was distributed among leading ETFs as follows: BlackRock’s ETHA: Dominated with $122.2 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FETH: Secured the second spot with $40.7 million. Grayscale’s ETH: Reported $8.8 million in net inflows. However, not all funds saw positive activity. Grayscale’s ETHE experienced a net outflow of $6.2 million , while other ETFs reported no significant changes. BlackRock’s ETHA Leads the Pack BlackRock’s ETHA emerged as the top performer, capturing nearly three-quarters of the total inflows. Its dominant position can be attributed to: Institutional Trust BlackRock, being the largest asset manager globally, has established a strong reputation, making its Ethereum ETF an attractive option for institutional investors. Liquidity and Market Accessibility ETHA offers high liquidity and seamless access to the Ethereum market, making it a preferred choice for both retail and institutional investors. Fidelity and Grayscale: Close Contenders Fidelity’s FETH Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF came in second, with $40.7 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s longstanding credibility in traditional finance has made its ETF a popular choice among cautious investors venturing into crypto. Grayscale’s ETH Grayscale’s ETH fund saw a modest $8.8 million in net inflows. This performance reflects consistent investor interest, despite the firm facing headwinds with its other product, ETHE , which recorded net outflows of $6.2 million. Eighth Day of Positive Inflows: What It Means The streak of positive inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs underscores several key trends: Growing Investor Confidence Ethereum’s potential as a long-term asset is gaining recognition, particularly as Ethereum continues to play a pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain innovations. Spot ETFs Gain Traction Spot Ethereum ETFs provide direct exposure to the cryptocurrency, a feature that is increasingly appealing to investors seeking simplicity and transparency in their crypto investments. Spot vs. Futures ETFs: Why Spot is Winning The preference for spot Ethereum ETFs over futures-based products lies in their inherent structure and benefits: Direct Exposure: Spot ETFs track the underlying asset directly, offering investors a clear stake in Ethereum’s performance. Lower Costs: Spot ETFs often come with lower management fees compared to futures-based alternatives. Reduced Complexity: Unlike futures ETFs, spot ETFs avoid the complications and risks associated with rolling contracts. Market Context: Ethereum’s Growing Adoption Ethereum’s prominence extends beyond ETFs, supported by its versatile blockchain ecosystem: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi, hosting major protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound. NFTs and Tokenization Ethereum’s dominance in the NFT space continues, with platforms like OpenSea and Blur built on its network. Institutional Interest The launch and success of spot Ethereum ETFs indicate that Ethereum is increasingly seen as a credible and investable asset by traditional financial players. Challenges Ahead for Ethereum ETFs Despite the bullish momentum, spot Ethereum ETFs face potential hurdles: Regulatory Scrutiny The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to scrutinize cryptocurrency-related products, posing challenges for ETF providers. Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile, which could deter conservative investors from diving into Ethereum ETFs. Competition Among Funds As more ETFs enter the market, competition could dilute inflows and affect the performance of individual funds. What’s Next for U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs? The growing interest in Ethereum ETFs suggests several possible developments: Increased Offerings: More financial institutions may launch Ethereum ETFs, expanding options for investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Continued inflows could improve liquidity, making ETFs more attractive to large-scale investors. Potential Bitcoin Effect: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs could further bolster interest and trust in Ethereum ETFs. Conclusion The $165.5 million net inflow into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on December 4, 2024, reflects a robust market appetite for Ethereum exposure through traditional investment vehicles. BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge, followed by Fidelity and Grayscale, showcasing the trust placed in these established financial giants. While challenges like regulatory scrutiny and market volatility persist, the consistent inflows signal growing confidence in Ethereum as a key asset in the crypto investment landscape. This milestone not only highlights the maturity of the crypto market but also paves the way for further innovation in digital asset investment products.

37274427,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107301,1733427602,Bitcoin Breaks Major Resistance: CryptoQuant CEO Urges Holders Not to Sell,"In a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has shattered a major psychological resistance level , reaching a new all-time high (ATH) and entering price discovery. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju announced the achievement on X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing his stance with a bold statement: “I repeat, do not sell your Bitcoin.” This event marks a critical turning point for Bitcoin holders and the broader market as it navigates uncharted territory. Bitcoin’s New All-Time High: Key Insights Bitcoin’s recent surge has captivated traders and investors, with several key aspects making this development noteworthy: Breaking Psychological Resistance: Bitcoin crossed a significant resistance level, bolstering bullish sentiment in the market. Entering Price Discovery: With no historical benchmarks above the current level, Bitcoin’s price movements are now driven by market speculation and demand. CryptoQuant CEO’s Message to Holders Ki Young Ju, CEO of the blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, took to social media to share his insights, urging holders to stay the course: “I repeat, do not sell your Bitcoin.” Ju’s advice stems from the historical pattern of Bitcoin reaching new heights and continuing to climb during price discovery phases. His statement underscores confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. What is Price Discovery, and Why Does It Matter? Price discovery refers to the process by which an asset’s market value is determined based on supply, demand, and market sentiment. For Bitcoin, entering price discovery signals that it has surpassed all previous price benchmarks, with its future value dictated by current market dynamics. Key characteristics of price discovery include: Increased Volatility: Prices can fluctuate significantly as traders test new levels. Speculative Buying: FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) often drives rapid price increases during this phase. Potential for New Resistance Levels: As Bitcoin rises, new psychological and technical resistance levels may emerge. Factors Driving Bitcoin’s Surge Several factors have contributed to Bitcoin’s recent rally: Institutional Adoption Growing interest from institutional investors has provided a steady inflow of capital, validating Bitcoin’s status as a legitimate asset class. Spot ETF Approval Anticipation Expectations around spot Bitcoin ETFs have fueled optimism, with investors positioning themselves for potential regulatory greenlights. Macroeconomic Trends Global economic uncertainties and inflation concerns have driven more investors toward Bitcoin as a store of value, enhancing its appeal as “digital gold.” Should Holders Follow the CEO’s Advice? Ju’s recommendation not to sell aligns with long-term investment strategies. Here’s why his advice could hold merit: Historical Trends: Bitcoin has historically surged significantly during price discovery phases, often doubling or tripling in value after breaking previous ATHs. Limited Supply: With Bitcoin’s supply capped at 21 million, increased demand during this phase could lead to exponential price growth. Long-Term Outlook: Holding through volatile periods has historically rewarded investors who maintain a long-term perspective. Market Sentiment: Bulls in Control The mood across the cryptocurrency community is overwhelmingly bullish. Metrics supporting this sentiment include: Rising Trading Volumes: Higher volumes on major exchanges indicate strong buyer interest. Whale Accumulation: Data from CryptoQuant suggests large holders are continuing to accumulate Bitcoin. Positive Social Media Buzz: Mentions of Bitcoin’s ATH and price discovery have surged across platforms. What Could Be the Next Resistance Level? While Bitcoin is currently in price discovery, analysts predict potential resistance levels based on Fibonacci extensions and historical patterns: $120,000: A strong psychological milestone. $150,000: Based on Fibonacci extensions, this could serve as a mid-term target. $200,000: A highly anticipated long-term level among bullish investors. Risks to Consider Despite the optimism, holders should remain cautious of the following risks: Market Corrections: Significant price drops are common during price discovery phases. Regulatory Uncertainty: Potential delays or rejections of spot Bitcoin ETFs could impact sentiment. Profit-Taking: Early investors may sell at current levels, causing short-term pullbacks. How to Navigate Bitcoin’s ATH? For traders and investors, strategic planning is crucial during this volatile phase: Set Clear Goals: Define your exit strategy based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Diversify Holdings: Avoid overexposure to Bitcoin by diversifying into other assets. Monitor Market Trends: Stay informed about whale activity, ETF developments, and macroeconomic shifts. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your gains by setting stop-loss levels to minimize potential losses during corrections. Conclusion Bitcoin’s breakthrough of a major resistance level and its entry into price discovery signal a transformative moment for the cryptocurrency market. As investors celebrate a new all-time high, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s emphatic advice to “not sell” reflects the confidence many hold in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. While opportunities abound, risks remain, requiring investors to approach this phase with both excitement and caution. This milestone reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a leading asset in the global financial ecosystem.

37262761,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623048,1733427240,Analysts Predict This DeFi Blockchain Could Overtake Uniswap by December 2025,"The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) is no stranger to competition. With innovation at its core, this space has seen countless platforms rise and fall as they vie for dominance. However, whispers in the crypto community are growing louder around one particular player that has the potential to disrupt the status quo. Analysts are forecasting that Lightchain , a revolutionary blockchain powered by artificial intelligence, could overtake industry leader Uniswap by the end of 2025. What makes Lightchain so unique? And what should investors and crypto enthusiasts know about this ambitious contender? Buckle up as we explore how this new DeFi blockchain is poised to reshape the crypto landscape. The Rise of Lightchain AI Lightchain isn’t just another blockchain project; it represents the future of decentralized innovation. By combining the power of blockchain with cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) through its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain has introduced something truly extraordinary. Its mission is clear: create a decentralized ecosystem that’s scalable, privacy-focused, and built to transform industries through AI-driven governance and computation. And the market is taking notice. Currently in its presale phase, Lightchain has already raised over $1 million with a growing community of supporters. But why are analysts predicting Lightchain AI will soon rival—or even surpass—established players like Uniswap? What Sets Lightchain Apart from Uniswap? To understand Lightchain’s potential to dethrone Uniswap, we first need to compare their core technologies and value propositions. 1. Consensus Mechanisms Uniswap operates as a decentralized exchange (DEX) leveraging Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) model for the consensus mechanism. This approach ensures security and scalability but doesn’t introduce any particularly innovative changes to that model. Lightchain , on the other hand, employs a game-changing Proof of Intelligence (PoI) protocol. Unlike PoS or Proof of Work (PoW), PoI incentivizes network nodes to perform valuable AI computations, such as training machine learning models and optimizing algorithms—tasks critical to the modern tech ecosystem. This not only enhances the blockchain’s efficiency but also integrates AI functionality directly. By incentivizing contributions that drive AI development, Lightchain is creating a blockchain that’s not just a ledger—it’s a living, evolving network with computational utility. 2. Expanded Ecosystem Potential While Uniswap focuses almost exclusively on facilitating token swaps and providing liquidity through its AMM (automated market maker) model, Lightchain’s vision reaches much further. At its core is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , a computational layer that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) optimized for AI tasks. This opens a wide array of new possibilities, from decentralized governance to AI-driven DeFi platforms. Unlocking such potential could position Lightchain as a go-to blockchain for both traditional DeFi enthusiasts and tech innovators seeking unparalleled functionality. 3. Community-Driven Innovation with Practical Utility Both Lightchain and Uniswap leverage decentralized governance models to give power back to their communities. However, Lightchain’s tools like the Transparent AI Framework and Memecoin Launchpad add innovative layers that encourage collaboration and reward creativity. For example: Transparent AI Framework ensures open and auditable AI model operations, fostering trust. Memecoin Launchpad allows creators to securely launch meme-based tokens with embedded AI-enhanced features. These additions make Lightchain far more versatile than Uniswap, which remains narrowly focused on token swaps. Key Metrics That Support Lightchain’s Predicted Growth While technology provides the foundation, several data points strengthen the case for Lightchain’s ascent in the DeFi sector. 1. Adoption Metrics Uniswap has been praised for its user-friendly interface and liquidity dominance, boasting over 4 million users and $1.3 trillion in traded volume as of 2023. However, its growth has plateaued in recent years as competition intensifies. Analysts note that Lightchain’s integration of AI-powered dApps and growing developer community could see its adoption skyrocket. With tools like PoI and AIVM attracting developers from diverse industries, Lightchain aims to serve millions of users across multiple verticals—not just DeFi. 2. Early Presale Success The ongoing Lightchain presale has raised over $1 million in funding with significant traction from crypto enthusiasts. At just $0.003 per token, investors are positioning themselves early to benefit from a project with exponential growth potential. 3. Partnership Opportunities Lightchain’s roadmap for partnerships includes collaboration with AI research organizations, Web3 developers, and enterprise clients. These connections are positioned to unlock additional use cases and expand its ecosystem far beyond traditional DeFi competitors like Uniswap. Timeline to the Top Analysts have circled December 2025 as the pivotal point when Lightchain could overtake Uniswap. Several milestones along Lightchain’s roadmap will be crucial in achieving this goal: 2024 Q2: Testnet rollout and performance optimization. 2024 Q4: Full mainnet launch with active validator nodes. 2025 Q2: Deployment of pioneering AI-powered dApps. 2025 Q4: Projected ecosystem growth across governance, dApps, and base-layer adoption. Coupled with Lightchain’s ability to generate real-world value through AI computation, these phases will pave the way for sustained growth and prominence. https://lightchain.ai Why Smart Investors are Eyeing Lightchain Now The key to any great investment is timing. And if analysts are right, 2023-2024 is the perfect moment to act on Lightchain. Projects like Ethereum and Uniswap saw early backers net significant returns as their ecosystems expanded over time. Lightchain, with its revolutionary PoI and AIVM technology, offers a similar opportunity. Investing in Lightchain’s ongoing presale at this early stage not only locks in tokens at a discounted rate but also provides access to exclusive governance rights and future ecosystem features. The Future of DeFi Could Belong to Lightchain It’s not every day that a blockchain comes along with the potential to flip the script in DeFi. With its innovative AI-driven approach and expanding community, Lightchain is emerging as more than just another contender—it’s a genuine disruptor. Whether you’re a crypto enthusiast, an investor, or just someone excited about AI’s potential to transform industries, Lightchain offers an opportunity you can’t ignore. 🚀 Don’t miss your chance to be a part of tomorrow’s DeFi revolution.

The platform announced on Dec. 5 that USDC ( USDC ), a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, is now available on Sui ( SUI ) via its infrastructure. This makes Copper one of the first digital asset custodians to support the stablecoin on the layer-1 blockchain. Circle enabled native USDC on Sui mainnet in October, bringing the stablecoin’s liquidity to developers and users on the Move programming language-based blockchain network. Native support eliminates the need for bridged USDC, enabling businesses to build decentralized applications across use cases such as decentralized finance, gaming, decentralized physical infrastructure networks and ecommerce. Read more: Phantom Wallet to integrate Sui L1 blockchain In its announcement, Copper highlighted that support for the stablecoin on Sui’s mainnet and layer-2 assets will provide users with streamlined USDC usage. “Support USDC on the Sui blockchain is a notable step in strengthening our partnership with Sui. With much more to unlock across the stablecoin and Real-World Asset spaces, we’re committed to connecting the institutional finance world to on-chain opportunities on the Sui Network,” Adam VandenBoogaard, co-head of revenue Americas at Copper noted. The price of Sui has surged to a new all-time high amid growth across its DeFi, DePIN, and gaming ecosystems. On Dec. 5, the SUI token reached a record $4.40, reflecting total gains of 110% in the past month and over 560% in the past year.

37262368,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311734,1733426567,Phantom Wallet Integrates Sui,"December 5, 2024 – Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands Leading wallet Phantom, which has over seven million MAUs (monthly active users), chooses Sui’s ‘high-performant’ blockchain as its next integration. The Sui Foundation today announced that Phantom Wallet, the leading non-custodial multichain cryptocurrency wallet, is now integrating with the Sui network. At seven million monthly active users, Phantom has the largest on-chain user base of wallets in the Web 3.0 industry. With over 560 million total on-chain transactions year-to-date – and key features such as staking, in-app token swaps, NFT storage, multichain support and Ledger hardware wallet integration – Phantom represents a significant milestone for the Sui network, which becomes the first blockchain outside of Solana, Bitcoin and Ethereum to be supported by the wallet. Sui is also the first blockchain built around the Move language to be supported by Phantom. Integrating the Sui network is also a significant step toward enhancing interoperability for Phantom Wallet and demonstrates how wallet providers and DApp (decentralized application) builders are betting on a multichain future rather than focusing on only one ecosystem. Jameel Khalfan, global head of ecosystem at the Sui Foundation, said, “The integration of Phantom Wallet with Sui represents a giant leap for the Sui ecosystem, which now gets access to a first-class wallet experience with several features that the Sui community has been asking for. “Phantom Wallet is selective about which chains they support, and we are proud to now be included among this notable group.” The integration of Phantom will provide Sui users with a reliable and secure wallet solution available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Brave, as well as a mobile app for iOS and Android. Brandon Millman, CEO of Phantom, said, “We’re excited to bring Sui support to millions of Phantom users. “Sui’s thoughtful approach to scalability and developer-focused solutions aligns with our commitment to high-performant blockchains. “We look forward to building together and supporting their growth.” Contact Sui Foundation This content is sponsored and should be regarded as promotional material.

37262414,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623454,1733426160,The regulatory authority for ADGM in the UAE  issues its stablecoin framework,"The regulatory arm of ADGM, the FSRA (Financial Services Regulatory Authority) in the UAE, has just issued its fiat-referenced-tokens framework, better known as its stablecoin regulations. The new framework expands the suite of digital assets already offered by ADGM regulatory authority. As per the press release, the framework introduces several key components that establish robust standards for FRT issuers to ensure financial stability and investor protection such as reserve assets, governance and integrity, transparent disclosure, prudential safeguards, and redemption rights. The framework makes FRT issuance a distinct Regulated Activity within ADGM’s comprehensive financial services regulatory regime. It has been designed to be risk-proportionate while ensuring FRT issuers operate in a safe and prudent manner. Emmanuel Givanakis, CEO of the ADGM FSRA stated, “Our FRT framework is a significant milestone in ADGM’s evolution as a progressive international financial center. Through extensive consultation with industry stakeholders, we have created a regime that balances innovation with strong regulatory oversight. This framework provides the regulatory certainty that industry participants need while maintaining high standards of financial stability and investor protection. We believe this positions ADGM as a premier jurisdiction for responsible FRT issuance and shows our commitment to fostering responsible innovation in financial services.” Fiat-referenced tokens can be used as forms of payment As per the framework, an accepted fiat-referenced token is one that, in the opinion of the Regulator, meets the requirements that permit a regulated activity to be carried on in relation to it. The FSRA defined a Fiat-Referenced Token (FRT) as a digital asset, the transfer and storage of which is achieved through the use of a distributed ledger (DLT) or similar technology. The FRT can be used as a medium of exchange with a stable store of value, by referencing a fixed amount of a single fiat currency; and enabling the holder to redeem the token in exchange for the amount of the fiat currency referred to from its issuer upon demand. The fiat-referenced token can be used for remittance payments, and payment transactions, including transfers, payments for services, direct debits, credit transfers between bank accounts, including standing orders, and others. Central Bank of UAE also issued its stablecoin regulations In June the UAE Central Bank issued its UAE Stablecoin Payment Token Services Regulation pertaining to payment tokens, not allowing algorithmic tokens to be included and only allowing foreign stablecoins to be used to purchase virtual assets, while AED stablecoins could be used to purchase products and services within the UAE The Central Bank of the UAE defined Payment Token Services as being digital payment services in the UAE comprising three categories, namely Payment Token Issuance, Payment Token Conversion, and Payment Token Custody and Transfer. Since then Tether announced that it would be launching an AED stablecoin in early 2025, while AED Stablecoin LLC in the UAE announced that the Central Bank of UAE had provided it with in-principle approval to launch and establish its own stablecoin, AE Coin.

Is it the groundbreaking technology, the visionary roadmap, or the hype surrounding its presale success? Right now, three projects are turning heads in the crypto community: Qubetics, Cosmos, and Zignaly. Cosmos continues to dazzle with its interconnected blockchain ecosystem, while Zignaly’s $100M ZIGChain fund is redefining decentralised investments. But all eyes are on Qubetics, whose presale has already raised $4.4 million, attracting over 6,500 holders. If you’re searching for the best altcoins to buy today, these three coins should be on your radar. Qubetics isn’t just another presale darling; it’s addressing long-standing challenges in blockchain development with its QubeQode IDE. From clunky user interfaces to scalability bottlenecks, Qubetics is poised to rewrite the rules. Analysts are buzzing with predictions of $10-15 per token post-mainnet launch, making $TICS a must-watch. Let’s dive deeper into these trailblazing projects and why they’re the best altcoins to buy today . Qubetics ($TICS): A Presale Juggernaut Solving Blockchain’s Pain Points Qubetics is a force to be reckoned with. In its 11th presale stage, the project has already sold over 270 million $TICS tokens at $0.0282 each. With over 6,500 token holders and a tally exceeding $4.4 million, it’s clear that investors see something special here. And the buzz isn’t without merit. Analysts predict a token price of $10-15 following its mainnet launch—a staggering potential return that’s catapulting $TICS into conversations about the best altcoins to buy today. But what truly sets Qubetics apart is its QubeQode . Blockchain development has long been plagued by complexity and inefficiency. Many tools on the market are unintuitive, leading to a steep learning curve for developers. QubeQode addresses this with a user-friendly interface that simplifies coding and deployment, making blockchain tech accessible to a broader audience. Scalability has also been a thorn in blockchain’s side. Limited transaction processing capacity has led to congestion and high fees on major networks like Ethereum. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE optimises scalability by streamlining development processes, paving the way for applications that can handle larger volumes without sacrificing speed or security. It’s the kind of innovation that could reshape the industry. The stakes are high, and Qubetics is playing to win. With its presale already a roaring success and its IDE promising to address real-world issues, $TICS is not just another token; it’s a revolution in the making. For more guidance, watch this video . Cosmos (ATOM): Building the Internet of Blockchains Cosmos is a project that’s as ambitious as it is innovative. Dubbed the “Internet of Blockchains,” Cosmos aims to create a network where multiple blockchains can communicate and operate seamlessly. It’s a solution that’s long overdue in a fragmented industry where interoperability is often an afterthought. This vision has solidified Cosmos’ place among the best altcoins to buy today. At the heart of Cosmos is the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which allows disparate blockchains to interact without compromising their individual sovereignty. This is a game-changer for developers looking to build cross-chain applications. The Cosmos SDK further simplifies the process, enabling projects to create custom blockchains tailored to their needs. With scalability, speed, and flexibility baked into its design, Cosmos is setting a new standard. The ecosystem is growing rapidly, with notable projects like Terra, Osmosis, and Binance Chain leveraging Cosmos’ technology. This expansion is fuelling demand for ATOM, the network’s native token, which is used for staking, governance, and transaction fees. As blockchain adoption continues to rise, Cosmos’ role in fostering interoperability makes it a top contender for any investor’s portfolio. Cosmos isn’t just about technology; it’s about creating a future where blockchains work together to solve real-world problems. Whether it’s streamlining supply chains or enabling decentralised finance, Cosmos is proving that collaboration, not competition, is the key to blockchain’s success. Zignaly (ZIG): Redefining Decentralised Investment Platforms Zignaly is making waves with its mission to democratise investment opportunities. The launch of its $100 million ZIGChain fund has positioned Zignaly as a leader in decentralised finance (DeFi), offering investors a chance to participate in high-yield opportunities without the barriers of traditional finance. It’s no wonder ZIG is being touted as one of the best altcoins to buy today. What sets Zignaly apart is its unique approach to profit-sharing. The platform allows users to invest with professional traders and share profits directly, creating a transparent and collaborative investment ecosystem. This model eliminates the need for middlemen, reducing costs and increasing trust. For those tired of opaque traditional investment vehicles, Zignaly offers a breath of fresh air. The $100M ZIGChain fund takes this concept to the next level by funding innovative projects and providing liquidity for the Zignaly ecosystem. It’s a bold move that underscores the platform’s commitment to long-term growth and innovation. As DeFi continues to disrupt traditional finance, Zignaly is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this burgeoning market. ZIG isn’t just an investment; it’s a statement. For those looking to align their portfolios with projects that are pushing the envelope, Zignaly is a must-consider. Conclusion The crypto market is brimming with opportunities, but not all projects are created equal. Qubetics, Cosmos, and Zignaly stand out for their innovation, real-world applications, and growth potential. Whether it’s Qubetics’ game-changing QubeQode IDE, Cosmos’ vision of an interconnected blockchain ecosystem, or Zignaly’s revolutionary approach to decentralised investments, these projects are setting the pace for the industry. If you’re serious about finding the best altcoins to buy today, now’s the time to act. Don’t let these opportunities pass you by—get in on the action and be part of the next wave of crypto success stories. Start with Qubetics before its presale ends, and keep an eye on Cosmos and Zignaly as they continue to redefine what’s possible in blockchain and DeFi. The future is here, and it’s yours for the taking.

Rise in Solana Token Creation Drives Record Protocol Growth As the protocol behind virtually all token creation on Solana, Metaplex has emerged as a primary beneficiary of the extraordinary surge in digital asset creation on the Solana network. This exponential level of activity, encompassing everything from memecoins to AI tokens and NFTs, directly contributes to Metaplex's protocol fees. This increased protocol fee generation has in turn funded record-breaking $MPLX token purchases for the Metaplex DAO. Since June 2024, 50% of the prior month’s protocol fees and a portion of the historical fees have been allocated to funding $MPLX token purchases for contribution to the DAO. In November 2024, this culminated in 12k SOL worth of $MPLX purchases — equivalent to approximately $3 million at current prices, marking a substantial 58% increase month-over-month and signifying the largest monthly $MPLX token purchases to date. Building on this momentum, Metaplex's November protocol fees hit an all-time high of $3.5 million, setting the stage for even larger allocations for $MPLX purchases in December. Record-Breaking Metaplex Protocol Metrics in November November's protocol activity shattered previous records across multiple metrics: Metaplex saw extraordinary growth in fungible token creation, with 1.4M new tokens minted — marking a 56% increase month-over-month compared to the previous all-time high in October 2024 and a new monthly record. This represented 94% of all Token Metadata assets created, driven primarily by memecoin activity on platforms such as Pump.fun. Metaplex Core, the next generation NFT standard, demonstrated significant adoption with a new all-time high of 354k assets created, driven by expanded use cases made possible due to the standard’s flexible design. User engagement metrics surged as the number of unique wallets interacting with the Metaplex protocol reached 879k — a 34% increase from October and a new all-time high.

37262305,https://thecoinrise.com/brazils-bitcoin-atms-surge-fuels-crypto-adoption/,1733425297,Brazil’s Bitcoin ATMs Surge Fuels Crypto Adoption,"Brazil, a leading crypto hub, is making waves in the world of digital finance. The nation has seen a remarkable surge in crypto adoption in recent years. Recently, Bitcoin ATMs have been popping up in major cities nationwide. This growth not only highlights Brazilians’ increasing trust in digital assets. It also signals a broader shift toward innovative financial technologies. The Rise of Bitcoin ATMs in Brazil In 2021, Brazil was home to just four Bitcoin ATMs. Fast forward to today, and that number has more than doubled, according to CounATMRadar’s data. Currently, nine ATMs are strategically placed in bustling urban centers like São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Petrópolis, São Bernardo do Campo and Bauru. This rapid growth underscores a nationwide embrace of digital assets, providing a convenient and accessible alternative to traditional banking. Unlike traditional banks, which can be inaccessible or slow for many, Bitcoin ATMs offer a user-friendly way to buy and sell Bitcoin. This makes it easier for anyone to access the world of digital currencies directly. One of the key players in this transformation is Coin Cloud, a company committed to expanding Brazil’s crypto infrastructure. The company has been instrumental in placing machines in urban centers nationwide. This has helped to bridge the gap between digital assets and everyday Brazilian citizens. By increasing the availability of Bitcoin ATMs, Coin Cloud aims to not only meet the growing demand. It also aims to foster a deeper understanding and acceptance of digital currencies among Brazilians. Brazil’s Bitcoin Surge Amid Regional Competition On a global scale, the number of Bitcoin ATMs is booming. CoinATMRadar reported that over 38,000 Bitcoin ATMs are spread across 67 countries. These ATMs are operated by 362 firms and built by 39 different producers, highlighting the global investment in Bitcoin infrastructure. While Brazil’s progress is impressive, it still lags behind some of its Latin American peers in the number of Bitcoin ATMs. Colombia leads the region with 46 machines, followed by Panama and Argentina with 17 and 13, respectively. This gap suggests that while Brazil progresses rapidly, it still has room to grow and compete with its regional counterparts. A Cultural Shift Toward Financial Technology The rise of Bitcoin ATMs in Brazil is more than just an increase in crypto transactions; it signals a cultural shift. As financial technology becomes more part of daily life, many Brazilians see digital currencies as real alternatives to traditional banking. Recently, Brazilian lawmakers proposed creating a national Bitcoin (BTC) reserve to strengthen the country’s economy. This proposal highlights that Bitcoin could be a good way for Brazil to protect itself during uncertain economic times, like currency drops or political issues. Educational initiatives about digital currencies are key to this change. As more people understand crypto, they will likely see Bitcoin and similar assets as practical tools for everyday transactions.

37261914,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311728,1733425272,Evrloot Launches Free-To-Play RPG Campaign on Polkadot’s Moonbeam Chain,"December 4, 2024 – Boston, Massachusetts No wallet, no gas – Evrloot brings seamless blockchain gameplay to all players. Evrloot , the anticipated blockchain-based RPG (role-playing game), is set to exit its closed beta and officially launch with a free-to-play campaign at the end of November 2024. Developed by a global team of 13 passionate builders, Evrloot offers a rogue-like, light-MMO experience in a medieval fantasy world, combining deep gameplay with innovative on-chain mechanics. Evrloot distinguishes itself from most Web 3.0 games with a unique approach – b uild a fun on-chain game first, talk later. The game empowers players by treating NFTs as save games, making progress and achievements tangible and tradable on-chain. Players’ in-game experiences – whether mastering fishing or crafting a powerful weapon – are captured as soulbound or equipable ERC-6220 – essentially NFTs 2.0 that can be seamlessly accessed across ecosystems, ensuring every victory stays with the players. Players will have the opportunity to explore idle missions, tactical auto-battler dungeons and on-chain crafting systems. Key features include the following. Idle missions – Players can deploy special bait to send their character on a six-hour fishing expedition, offering the chance to discover rare items. Crafting – R esources such as fish and herbs can be combined to mint health potions. Tactical dungeons – Players equip their loot to navigate dangerous dungeons. Only those who exit safely keep their spoils, which are minted on-chain. NFT trading marketplace – V aluable items, such as a ‘damaged battle axe,’ can be exchanged for health potions and other resources through the game’s native marketplace. Evrloot began as a passion project from Polkadot fans who believed NFTs could do more than just exist as collectibles. The game has grown steadily during its beta phase, recording over 1.5 million on-chain transactions on Kusama and Polkadot and fostering a community of around 400 NFT owners. It peaked at 1,000 MAU (monthly active users) during the successful ‘Pink Event.’ For the full release, the game will launch on Moonbeam, with a seamless onboarding experience featuring wallet and gas abstraction. Evrloot’s launch prioritizes accessibility. Players can dive into the full gameplay experience without barriers – no crypto wallet or upfront payment required. As they progress, players have the option to upgrade their free-to-play characters to NFTs for enhanced features. However, the game ensures that free players enjoy the complete experience without any pressure to upgrade. Tobi ‘Deckard’ Amann, CEO of Chainfood Studio, the developers of Evrloot, said, “Our goal with Evrloot is to create an immersive and thrilling dark fantasy Web 3.0 world that prioritizes fun and player enjoyment, transforming the world into a canvas for its players. “Through their in-game actions, players shape the story and forge the lore of this world. “As RPG enthusiasts, creating a canvas like this has always been our dream – and with Evrloot, we’ve found an exciting and ethical opportunity to bring our vision fully on-chain.” Sicco Naets, head of ecosystem development at Moonbeam, said, “I am very excited to see Evrloot enter its next growth phase. “Chainfood Studio has a very special game in Evrloot with a fiercely loyal community – moving to a free-to-play model will give them a lot more exposure and will allow a lot more players [to] discover what makes this game so special.” Evrloot’s player onboarding uses a gamified affiliate campaign. Players join in-game clans that link back to the affiliates that brought them to the game. Being part of an active in-game clan not only shows player alliance with existing communities – it boosts the points they can potentially earn that are important for phase two of the campaign. Players join for free and can optionally upgrade to one of 1,299 exclusive NFT 2.0 characters. With ‘freemium’ upgrades, cosmetics and marketplace fees driving the business model, Evrloot offers a sustainable economy without compromising the player experience. While Evrloot operates without a token at launch, players are able to gather points by completing tasks and referring friends. Evrloot will also run a giveaway campaign to coincide with the game’s launch. Players who participate in specific in-game activities will have the chance to win one of three exclusive merch packs, featuring original hand-drawn concept art on handmade medieval paper, an Evrloot t-shirt and stickers. Players can enter by joining the ‘???’ clan for at least one day between the release date and December 21, 2024. Winners will be drawn on December 21 and contacted via X (if linked in-game). For more information, users can follow Evrloot on social media for the most current updates.

Speaking during an interview, Lee explained how Bitcoin's rise reflects a broader risk appetite among investors and the potential for a sustained market rally. “This really tells us that investors are risk-averse,” Lee said. “Bitcoin breaking out of its holding pattern signals what the S&P 500 is going to do for the rest of the year. We’re seeing a lot of capital that was sitting idle or on the sidelines in money markets now moving back into risk assets.” The analyst discussed the market’s changing view on the Fed’s rate cuts. Lee believes that early 2024 could see fewer rate cuts than initially expected, but that could benefit the market by prolonging the dovish cycle. Related News: Here's the First Moves of the Oldest Whales After Bitcoin Tops $100,000 “There is a conceptual shift happening,” Lee said. “Investors are realizing that fewer rate cuts in 2025 could actually be bullish because it will keep monetary policy accommodative for longer.

Interestingly, this Ethereum price increase has come amidst a simultaneous increase in the performance of ETH against BTC in recent weeks. According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, this recent price action might actually be the earliest stages of Ethereum’s price increase against Bitcoin within the next six to 12 months. Analysing The ETH/BTC Pair The last two weeks were highlighted by a consolidation of the Bitcoin price below the $99,000 price level as investors continued to await a break above $100,000. Amidst this Bitcoin price correction, the Ethereum price kickstarted a notable increase from the $3,340 level on November 26. This rally allowed Ethereum and many other altcoins to outperform Bitcoin, leading to speculation about whether the crypto market is now in the initial phases of a long-awaited altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100,000: Why Reclaiming The $96,400 Level Is Very Important For Another Rally According to technical analysis from popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, this might be the earliest recovery stage for the ETH/BTC pair. Taking to social media platform X, Cowen remarked that the ETH/BTC pair recently bottomed out at 0.03187, which aligns closely with his previously forecasted worst-case scenario of 0.03. Back in 2023, Cowen had predicted a substantial decline in the ETH/BTC pair. Back then, the ETH/BTC pair was trading around 0.066, but he predicted that it could drop by over 45% at that point. Interestingly, this prediction has materialized as Ethereum’s valuation relative to Bitcoin has been on a decline since the last quarter of 2023 up until recent weeks. Fast forward to December 2024; Ethereum has rebounded and is performing well against Bitcoin. Particularly, the ETH/BTC pair is currently around 0.0396, up 24% from a 2024 low of 0.03187. This resurgence prompted Cowen to re-examine the ETH/BTC pair, and his outlook has turned positive. Historical Trends Suggest A Seasonal Rebound Cowen highlighted Ethereum’s historical tendencies, noting that the ETH/BTC pair often gains momentum in December or January. If this trend holds and the ETH/BTC pair gains momentum in December, Ethereum may already be in the early stages of recovery. However, if it was to wait until January, a sweep of prior lows at 0.03187 and possibly 0.03 remains possible but increasingly unlikely. He added that within a few months, the exact bottom might become irrelevant.

Such a move would be highlighted by the Ethereum price outperforming the Bitcoin price and a full altcoin season. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,845. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has finally broken above the $100,000 mark and is currently trading at $103,000. The ETH/BTC pair is currently trading at 0.03755.

With market dynamics shifting and institutional interest surging, the landscape is ripe for significant gains. As Ripple’s XRP continues to soar, driven by regulatory optimism and robust market activity, investors are keenly eyeing even prospects that are said to capitalize on the potential market shift. RCO Finance (RCOF) is an upcoming project that aims to capitalize on the potential market uptick associated with the XRP ETF launch. The project aims to increase its token value from $0.077 to $1 within a few months. XRP ETF is Set to Improve Crypto Investment Strategies The potential debut of an XRP ETF signals a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. By integrating XRP into an ETF structure, Ripple is set to bridge the gap between digital currencies and traditional finance.

37261970,https://crypto.news/?p=14316574,1733425200,Cardano price hits $1 but this ADA alternative has 15x more potential by January 2025,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano hits $1, XRP surges, but analysts favor PropiChain with 15x growth projections and $670K presale sold. Table of Contents What’s next for ADA after Cardano price hits $1 Why PropiChain outpaces the Cardano price rally by 15x PropiChain sells $730k, emerges best crypto presale project of the cycle Altcoin season is off to a promising start, with the Cardano price crossing the psychological $1 mark for the first time in two years. Considering the XRP altcoin hit $2.5 from $1 a week ago, many believe Cardano (ADA) is next to surge. Yet, analysts say neither of them is the best altcoins to buy now, favoring a new RWA altcoin called PropiChain (PCHAIN) instead. With projections to outpace Cardano by 15x by January, investors are betting big on the PCHAIN presale , with over $670,000 already sold in round one. What’s next for ADA after Cardano price hits $1 Like the rest of the crypto market, the Cardano price surged from Trump’s electoral victory, rising 269.59% over the past month to $1.26 today. Analysts believe Cardano is poised for 3x growth after news of Robinhood’s relisting of ADA, combined with rumors of a Cardano ETF and a potential Cardano-powered federal voting system. Yet, the Cardano price rally has stalled after reaching $1, unlike its rival XRP, which ballooned from around $1 to $2.5 as altcoin season heats up. Cardano (ADA) is still one to watch under Trump’s tenure. However, investors hunting for the best cryptos to buy before the bull run ends are drawn to PropiChain’s astonishing 9,000% profit potential. You might also like: ADA at $1 vs. PropiChain’s 18,000% prediction: Both compete to yield higher returns Why PropiChain outpaces the Cardano price rally by 15x Success as a crypto investor goes beyond knowing when to buy or sell; it has as much to do with the token someone holds. That’s why crypto OGs cherish the opportunity to discover rare, undervalued gems like PropiChain at its cheapest price. In 2024 alone, the number of crypto millionaires has doubled, according to a Henley & Partners study. Their secret was holding Bitcoin (BTC) and getting in very early on lucrative crypto projects. Unsurprisingly, savvy investors have swarmed round one of the PropiChain presale, acquiring over $730,000 worth of PCHAIN altcoins at the lowest price it’ll ever be ($0.004). PropiChain’s irresistibility stems from its unique blockchain real estate solutions approach. PropiChain is tackling the major problems plaguing the $634 trillion real estate industry , including rampant property fraud, high capital requirements, poor market access, lengthy transaction times, and inefficient property management. Unlike competing solutions focusing on a single area, PropiChain can solve all these platforms with its unique combination of blockchain, RWA tokenization, metaverse, smart contracts, and AI technologies. It all starts with blockchain tech, enabling PropiChain to tokenize real estate assets , store them on an impenetrable blockchain, and manage them efficiently with smart contracts. Picture a world where property transactions are digital. PropiChain users can trade physical properties in unlimited fractions, removing the financial barrier to investing in real estate. Trades will happen instantly instead of taking up to 44 days on average. Moreover, transactions occur on a tamper-proof blockchain, removing the ability to forge documents, impersonate asset owners, and destroy transaction data. Coupled with a metaverse marketplace offering virtual tours, virtual meetings, and virtual staging for investors or home buyers, PropiChain offers an unmatched property-finding experience that can make it the top real estate trading hub. Experts anticipate enormous PropiChain adoption , translating into massive growth for PCHAIN. Until now managing asset rights and rental agreements digitally has been challenging, but not anymore, as PropiChain’s smart contracts come equipped with auto leasing, auto rent collection, and auto-renewal features. Artificial intelligence takes automation on PropiChain a step further with features for filtering through millions of properties with custom parameters, identifying over/underpriced assets, and automatically trading properties when they reach, rise, or fall below a specified price. PropiChain prepares to surge just as the Cardano price stalls The Cardano price stalled as other major altcoins made impressive gains over the week. Interested users should consider ADA for their portfolio, as Trump’s pro-crypto policies can send the Cardano price flying in 2025. Still, many believe Cardano may have already peaked in this bull cycle. With the XRP price also peaking, the market now turns to PropiChain , a promising new altcoin that can outperform the market with a 9,000% surge by January. PropiChain sells $730k, emerges best crypto presale project of the cycle Investors have two options. Watch PropiChain explode from its lowest-ever price today or acquire a stake in the project reshaping real estate. Savvy investors are choosing the latter, with over $730,000 worth of PCHAIN altcoins acquired very early into the PropiChain presale . The good news is round one is still open, selling PCHAIN at $0.004, probably the cheapest it’ll ever be. A round-one investment of $865 today will yield $2,665 and $7,797 by the second and final round. However, PCHAIN holders will undoubtedly HODL their precious altcoins as a $865 round-one investment can yield $78,715 by January. Yet, time is running out. The recent successful BlockAudit security audit and the PropiChain CoinMarketCap listing spotlighted the project, moving it closer to round two. Those who missed ADA when the Cardano price was at its lowest should consider taking advantage of PropiChain at its initial price today.

Coffeezilla: “This is one of the most miserable, horrible launches I’ve ever seen in my life…” Haliey Welch: “Okay, then why the fuck are you on then?” That snippet came from last night’s X Spaces for the HAWK memecoin launch by Haliey Welch, aka “The Hawk Tuah Girl.” The majority of memecoin launches end up going nowhere, but none have cratered quite so quickly as HAWK. In what might be the fastest rug pull of all time, HAWK launched yesterday to a $490 million market cap, and then nuked to a $64 million market cap within 30 minutes. Source: Dexscreener HAWK has since dumped to a $27 million market cap at time of writing. HAWK’s tokenomics might be the most egregious yet: Only 2% was allocated to the public with a 17% “Strategic Allocation” for KOLs that were fully unlocked on token generation. Welch has publicly claimed that the internal team did not sell any tokens, but insiders were caught onchain doing so. According to Bubblemaps , 96% of the token supply was in a related cluster. “Straight Tuah Prison” ( TUAH ), an alternative memecoin, launched as a response to the disaster. It has since climbed to a $12.3 million market cap. Maybe something good will come out of this after all. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

37261881,https://nulltx.com/?p=135275,1733425010,"Why Is The Price of Crypto Going Up? Understanding Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana Are Up","The crypto market is now enjoying an auspicious time and prices across the charts are rising. Bitcoin (BTC) has successfully breached the psychological barrier of $100K. Ethereum (ETH) priced today at $3,853.67 continues its uptick while Solana (SOL) has experienced notable gains as well, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $7 billion. Meanwhile, young altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) continues to create a growing buzz with its zero-gas technology and Web3 innovations. With Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana seemingly aiming for strong finishes in 2024, could the market be in for new highs? Could new altcoin JetBolt be the next-gen token set to rise among the big players? Let’s explore why the price of crypto is going up and what coins are shaking up the market. Crypto Prices are Going Up: What’s driving the surge? The crypto market seems to be riding a surge of newfound prosperity since the re-election of Donald Trump to the US Presidency. The over-all market capitalization currently stands at $3.68 trillion, with several cryptocurrency prices surging to new all-time highs. With rising institutional adoption, ETF inflows and robust on-chain activities across major blockchain networks, the market continues to bustle. Let’s dive deeper into understanding why the main cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are up. Bitcoin surged past $100K: What’s next for BTC? In the month of November, Bitcoin (BTC) began its quest to set new records. Dubbed the “crown jewel of the crypto space”, Bitcoin continues to assert its leadership and dominance in the market. And for many crypto insiders, BTC’s price performance has a rippling effect across the crypto space. Bitcoin is currently trading at $102,712.65, with a market cap of over $2 billion. According to analysts, Bitcoin is bullish, driven by BTC being embraced both by institutions and retail. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard are amongst the companies that first believed in Bitcoin, with the US spot Bitcoin ETFs drawing a massive $6.2 billion in net inflows in November 2024. Microstrategy owner Michael Saylor, a staunch supporter of Bitcoin, claims that Bitcoin will never dip below $60K again. Furthermore, he says BTC will top six figures in 2025 and inevitably reach $1M someday. For Saylor, volatility is a necessary element in Bitcoin’s growth. Can Ethereum hit its $4000 target? Until very recently, Ethereum has been receiving a bit of flak as it seems to be perennially underperforming compared to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin was smashing records one after another, ETH appeared to be growing but not at the same rate. Ethereum is currently trading at $3,917.39, having woken up from months of consolidation. Early last week, ETH hit a six-month high of $3,900 as Bitcoin broke through the $100K barrier. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a net inflow of $882.3 million since November 22, mostly from BlackRock’s ETHA fund. Month-long Price chart of Ethereum courtesy of Coingecko Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has also been growing at a steady pace. ETH’s DeFi total value locked is at $72.9 billion while its total value locked (TVL) has reached a 31-month high of $134.7 billion. ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at a neutral 63, suggesting a maturing accumulation phase, following the footsteps of Bitcoin. JetBolt: A magnet for crypto whales with its zero-gas technology While these established tokens are making marks in the crypto space, a disruptive new altcoin is making Web3 waves of its own amid the bull run: JetBolt (JBOLT). JetBolt’s zero-gas technology, which eliminates gas fees, is a fresh breakthrough that offers practical benefits for both everyday users and developers. This feature from Skale enables users to make blockchain transactions minus the hefty gas costs, while empowering developers who can now work on decentralized applications (dApps) in a more cost-efficient manner. With a social twist in its staking system, JetBolt introduces an opportunity for stakers to earn more tokens as they stake and connect with friends on the platform. This enhances staking, turning it into a collaborative, community-shared experience. Early adopters are also enjoying presale discounts of up to 25% extra tokens when they avail of JetBolt’s special Alpha Boxes or token batch purchases. It’s no wonder JetBolt’s presale has already sold over 100 million tokens, indicating a interest from a growing number of crypto buyers and whales. With innovative features propelling its momentum, JetBolt is swiftly establishing itself as a revolutionary altcoin to watch in the crypto space. Solana: Could SOL revisit its $260 ATH? Solana (SOL) has achieved significant wins in the month of November, breaching its $260 ATH and dominating DEX volume trading activity. But SOL has been experiencing dips over the last two weeks, falling on average by 2.7%. As Bitcoin and Ethereum are making notable progress, Solana—sometimes referred to as the Ethereum killer—is trying to hold its ground. Currently trading at $236.69, SOL’s market cap still stands big at over $110 billion. Despite the recent dips and period of consolidation, SOL’s relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55, indicating neutral ground, which could potentially trigger buying pressure. According to analysts, the SOL/USDT pair could swing between the $210 and $248 marks for a few days. A break and close to $248 could potentially open doors for a rally to $264, which would indicate a successful revisit of SOL’s $260 ATH. Final thoughts on Why are Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana Up Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are three of the biggest and most dominant players in the crypto market today. They have come a long way, experienced rises and dips, and waves and crashes, but have survived them all. Meanwhile, the young altcoin JetBolt stands out with its zero-gas technology and other user-centric Web3 features that deliver practical blockchain solutions. These strong attributes position JetBolt as a formidable contender in the crypto space, making it one of the top next-generation altcoins to watch during these exciting times.

37261977,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623445,1733424667,Anthony Scaramucci jokes about buying Donald Trump a Christmas gift as he and other Bitcoin bulls celebrate BTC at $100K,"History has been made with Bitcoin crossing $100k earlier today. Following Bitcoin reaching the highly anticipated mark, Anthony Scaramucci, the hedge-fund manager who experienced a brief tenure in the Trump administration, jokes that he owes his former boss a gesture of gratitude. When asked about the rise in Bitcoin prices after Trump’s re-election, he joked, “I probably have to buy Donald Trump a Christmas present.” He used to call Trump a friend but now sees him as a danger to the country, “Like a McDonald’s gift card.” Scaramucci, like many of the investors who persevered with BTC through its ups and downs, scandals, and scams, is now enjoying great profits. The original crypto hit a six-figure price on Wednesday. This is not only a 199,999,900% increase from its 5-cent price 15 years ago, but it’s also proof that people who held on to the idea were right. People no longer think of this mysterious internet money as little more than a toy for criminals and outsiders. With support from the next president and exchange-traded funds that hold $108 billion that are directly linked to the digital currency, BTC has crossed the line into something that looks like legitimacy. Congratulations are in order from Bitcoin bulls Donald Trump congratulated the Bitcoiners after hitting the 100k mark. He added, “You are welcome! Together, we make America great again!” This commentary shows that Trump knows the impact he made in getting involved with Bitcoin. Brian Armstrong of Coinbase wrote , “Bitcoin is the best-performing asset of the last 12 years, and it’s still in its early days. Happy Bitcoin $100k day.” Trump’s right-hand man, Elon Musk, also joined the celebration by tweaking the like button on X. When the milestone level approached, the head of SkyBridge Capital remarked, “Bitcoin worth $100,000?” In a recent interview, he added, “I feel validated.” Changpeng Zhao answered the people who congratulated him on making money from Bitcoin. He wrote , “No, not exactly. I still have the same number of Bitcoins. It’s just that everything else became a little cheaper relative to Bitcoin.” On the other hand, Peter Schiff is still on anti-crypto. He wrote on X , “It’s ironic that Bitcoin only hit $100k by buying off politicians and getting in bed with the government. Without expected government intervention, this milestone never would have been hit. What couldn’t be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state.” Bitcoin enthusiasts explain what it means for Bitcoin to hit the $100,000 mark Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy, is one of the industry leaders who has consistently predicted that BTC will surpass $100,000. He said, “We are seeing a paradigm shift Bitcoin and the whole ecosystem of digital assets are on a brink of entering the mainstream of finance after four years of political purgatory.” Novogratz also said, “Over the long term, I’m bullish. It won’t be a straight lineup, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the U.S., it’ll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice.” In addition, Yi He, co-founder of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, said as the $100,000 milestone approached“ The significance of Bitcoin’s price breaking through the $100,000 milestone lies in providing the public with a powerful memory point, showing that those unbelievable things are really happening.” She added, “The small, persistent efforts accumulated day-by-day over the past decade by members of the crypto community will ultimately converge into this historic scene.” Although a healthy skepticism toward digital assets persists in numerous sections of Wall Street, the view has become costly due to the persistent returns and resilience of BTC, as well as an abrupt, drastic reversal in the outlook for regulatory risks in the crypto industry. Rick Wurster, the prospective CEO of Charles Schwab Corp., has stated that the company intends to provide spot crypto trading once US regulations are simplified, which he anticipates will occur during the upcoming administration.

Now, the partnership moves beyond the digital world and into the physical, with a limited-edition collection of 1,200 physical Adidas Ultraboost Five running shoes.

37261584,https://nulltx.com/?p=135270,1733424175,Is XRP Headed To The Moon? Why Analysts Think XRP and New Altcoin JetBolt Could Explode,"Ripple’s XRP and JetBolt (JBOLT) are commanding attention as potential game-changers in the cryptocurrency market. XRP’s 56.21% surge in seven days has reignited speculation about its ability to head to the moon. While XRP battles critical resistance levels in its quest to surpass its all-time high, JetBolt is turning heads as an innovative altcoin with its zero-gas fee technology. The new altcoin is gaining traction by solving real-world challenges with its intuitive ecosystem. Are we witnessing the early stages of the next market explosion? Read on to explore the trends, catalysts, and expert predictions driving XRP and JetBolt toward potential breakthroughs. Is XRP Headed to the Moon? At press time, XRP is priced at $2.30, marking a 10.81% dip in the last 24 hours, though it remains up 56.21% over the past week. This volatility has analysts debating its trajectory, with many eyeing the $3.31 all-time high as a critical benchmark. Prominent analysts caution that the token may face challenges. IncomeSharks recently commented on XRP’s price action that Ripple’s significant token holdings contribute to periodic “pumping and dumping.” Historical XRP/USD Price Movements (Source Credit: IncomeSharks/X) Indicators such as a declining Mean Coin Age suggest profit-taking among investors. Sentiment data reveals that over 98% of XRP’s circulating supply is also in profit, a condition often preceding market tops. Should this trend persist, XRP may struggle to sustain upward momentum. However, Ripple’s upcoming launch of the RLUSD stablecoin and its potential XRP ETF approval are viewed as positive catalysts. Weiss Crypto attributes XRP’s rise to favorable regulatory developments and technical upgrades that enhance its ecosystem. XRP’s technical outlook remains promising. According to Elliott Wave analysis, XRP is currently in its third wave, historically the strongest in a bullish cycle. The cryptocurrency is hovering near critical support levels between $2.25 and $2.45. Analysts stress the importance of maintaining these zones to avoid a bearish reversal. On the resistance side, the $3 mark remains a pivotal level, with the $2.85–$2.90 range as a crucial resistance zone. Breaking through this range could open doors to higher targets. With significant developments on the horizon and key technical levels in play, XRP’s ability to head to the moon depends on whether it can maintain support and break through resistance barriers. Meanwhile, innovative altcoins like JetBolt (JBOLT) are leveraging new technology to redefine what’s possible in the cryptocurrency space. Why New Altcoin JetBolt Could Explode JetBolt (JBOLT) has captured the crypto world’s attention as a fresh altcoin with the tools to disrupt traditional blockchain norms. JetBolt’s defining innovation is its zero-gas technology, a breakthrough that eliminates gas fees—long considered a barrier to broader blockchain adoption. Built on the robust Skale Network, JetBolt’s zero-gas tech doesn’t just make transactions cheaper. By addressing one of crypto’s most frustrating pain points, JetBolt positions itself as the altcoin that prioritizes accessibility and efficiency. Beyond cost-effective transactions, JetBolt is revolutionizing staking by introducing a social-first approach. This feature elevates staking from a passive activity to an engaging experience. This interactive model creates an ecosystem where users are encouraged to be active participants, turning staking into a fun and rewarding endeavor rather than a static process. The trend of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into blockchain ecosystems is another area where JetBolt shines. Its AI-powered aggregation tool offers users curated content that simplifies market developments. JetBolt’s AI feature organizes news stories by sentiment—whether bullish or bearish—offering a fun and accessible way to keep up with the market. In a world increasingly fascinated by AI’s role in technology, this feature highlights JetBolt’s ability to merge engaging utility with contemporary trends. The presale has added to JetBolt’s momentum, with over 100 million JBOLT tokens sold. JetBolt’s unique Alpha Boxes reward buyers with bonus tokens for bulk purchases. Combined with daily price increases, this presale model incentivizes early action. The presale structure reflects the same thoughtfulness JetBolt applies to its overall ecosystem. This balance of functionality and user-friendly design underscores JetBolt’s appeal as a next-gen altcoin. Why Analysts Think XRP and New Altcoin JetBolt Could Explode Although XRP faces challenges such as critical resistance levels and shifting investor sentiment, its technical structure and ecosystem developments keep it on the radar of analysts and enthusiasts. XRP’s ability to navigate these hurdles in the coming weeks will determine if it can truly head to the moon. In parallel, JetBolt (JBOLT) stands out as a rising star in the altcoin space. By addressing the inefficiencies of traditional blockchain networks and embracing trends like zero-gas technology and AI integration, JetBolt is poised to redefine how cryptocurrencies are used and perceived. With its presale gaining momentum and unique features drawing attention, JetBolt shines as an altcoin with the potential to explode into the mainstream. Curious about JetBolt’s features and presale?

37274426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107303,1733424000,U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $550.35 Million in Total Net Inflows on December 4,"On December 4, 2024, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined net inflow of $550.35 million , marking another strong day of investment activity. According to an X (formerly Twitter) post by Trader T, the largest contributions came from BlackRock’s IBIT, which led with an impressive $565.24 million in net inflows. Other notable inflows were recorded by Grayscale’s Mini BTC, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Bitwise’s BITB, highlighting the growing appeal of Bitcoin ETFs as mainstream investment vehicles. Breaking Down the Numbers: ETF Inflows and Outflows Top Performers by Net Inflows BlackRock’s IBIT : Dominated with $565.24 million in net inflows, showcasing its position as the leading spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. market. Grayscale’s Mini BTC : Achieved $55.71 million in net inflows, reflecting continued interest despite competition from other major ETFs. Fidelity’s FBTC : Recorded $17.27 million, bolstered by Fidelity’s reputation as a trusted financial institution. Bitwise’s BITB : Gained $6.44 million in net inflows, demonstrating steady, albeit modest, investor interest. Notable Outflows While most ETFs saw positive inflows, Grayscale’s GBTC stood out with a net outflow of $94.31 million , signaling a shift in investor preferences away from its structured trust product in favor of direct spot ETFs. Why Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Gaining Momentum? The strong inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs reflect a combination of factors driving investor interest: Regulatory Clarity Recent approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs have brought greater legitimacy to the crypto market, encouraging institutional and retail participation. Direct Exposure Unlike futures-based ETFs, spot ETFs offer direct exposure to Bitcoin, allowing investors to track the cryptocurrency’s price more accurately. Institutional Trust Funds from established players like BlackRock and Fidelity inspire confidence, making Bitcoin more accessible to traditional investors. BlackRock’s IBIT Leads the Market BlackRock’s IBIT ETF accounted for over 100% of the total net inflows on December 4. This anomaly is due to the combined outflows from other funds, particularly Grayscale’s GBTC, which offset gains from other ETFs. BlackRock’s success can be attributed to: Market Reputation: As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock attracts institutional investors who prioritize security and reliability. Robust Infrastructure: IBIT’s operational model ensures high liquidity and seamless market access. Grayscale’s Transition Challenges While Grayscale’s Mini BTC ETF saw positive inflows, its GBTC product experienced significant outflows, losing $94.31 million in a single day. This decline highlights a shift in investor preference: From Trusts to ETFs: Investors are moving away from structured trust products like GBTC in favor of spot ETFs, which offer better pricing and lower fees. Regulatory Competition: Grayscale faces mounting pressure from newly approved competitors offering more efficient investment options. The Growing Popularity of Fidelity and Bitwise ETFs Fidelity’s FBTC Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF, with $17.27 million in net inflows, benefits from its longstanding credibility in traditional finance. This positions FBTC as a strong contender in the growing ETF landscape. Bitwise’s BITB Bitwise’s smaller but consistent inflows of $6.44 million reflect its niche appeal among retail investors seeking low-cost exposure to Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Increased Liquidity The surge in spot ETF inflows enhances liquidity in the Bitcoin market, making it more attractive to institutional investors. Market Stability Positive inflows into Bitcoin ETFs often indicate growing confidence, potentially leading to reduced volatility in the broader crypto ecosystem. Price Support Sustained demand for Bitcoin ETFs could help support Bitcoin’s price, particularly during periods of high market uncertainty. Risks to Monitor Despite the strong inflows, there are challenges and risks that investors should consider: Market Corrections: Inflows alone cannot prevent price corrections, especially if large holders decide to sell. Regulatory Headwinds: Any regulatory setbacks, such as delays or rejections of new ETF filings, could dampen sentiment. Competitive Pressures: As more ETFs enter the market, existing funds may face reduced inflows due to investor diversification. What’s Next for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market is poised for further growth, with several potential developments on the horizon: Increased Institutional Participation: More institutions are expected to allocate capital to Bitcoin through ETFs. Expansion of Offerings: New ETF launches will likely diversify the investment landscape, catering to different investor needs. Global Adoption: Success in the U.S. market could encourage other countries to approve similar ETFs, expanding Bitcoin’s accessibility worldwide. Conclusion The combined net inflows of $550.35 million into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 4 underline the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a mainstream investment asset. With BlackRock’s IBIT leading the charge, other funds like Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s Mini BTC continue to attract substantial interest. However, the outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC highlight the evolving preferences of investors favoring spot ETFs for their efficiency and transparency. This milestone reflects not only the maturity of the Bitcoin ETF market but also its potential to shape the future of cryptocurrency investments.

37261832,181894,1733423899,Premier Art Holdings and Chintai Nexus Launch $50M+ Tokenized Fine Art Fund,"Toronto, Canada, December 5th, 2024, Chainwire Premier Art Holdings Ltd., a leader in fine art investment, and Chintai, a compliance-focused Layer-1 blockchain platform for tokenizing real-world assets, have partnered to launch the first $50 million tranche of tokenized fine art for The Premier Art Token (TPAT). Premier Art’s Platform, built using Chintai’s white-label tokenization technology, empowers investors to own and trade fractionalized tokens of what is anticipated to become a cumulative multi-billion dollar asset portfolio of fine art, unlocking liquidity and broadening access to a traditionally exclusive and illiquid asset class. Unlocking Liquidity in an Illiquid Asset Class Historically, fine art can be a reliable store of value, but due to its high cost, it is accessible only to the ultra-wealthy. Premier Art Holdings and Chintai are changing this dynamic with the introduction of TPAT, allowing investors to trade fractional tokens of a curated portfolio of fine art masterpieces. This initiative makes one of the strongest-performing asset classes accessible to a broader audience. “We’re thrilled to partner with Premier Art Holdings to offer a solution that goes beyond liquidity. Tokenization provides access to assets previously out of reach for most investors. Chintai’s blockchain infrastructure ensures transparency and security in fine art investments,” said David Packham, CEO of Chintai. Art as a Proven Store of Value Fine art has historically delivered inflation-adjusted returns that outperform traditional assets, like equities and government bonds. Even during economic instability, fine art can remain a stable store of value, ideal for diversification and long-term growth. TPAT offers investors fractional ownership of a curated portfolio of masterpieces with substantial return potential as the portfolio appreciates. “Scarcity drives value. Fine art by the historical Masters continues to appreciate in value because it cannot be diluted. For example, Michelangelo is not sculpting any more ‘David’s’ or ‘Pietas’ and Da Vinci is not painting any more ‘Mona Lisa’s.’ By tokenizing our portfolio, we are democratizing access to one of history’s most reliable asset classes while giving investors the flexibility to trade their shares. This partnership transforms fine art from a static, illiquid asset into a dynamic, tradable investment for a wider audience,” said Bob Johnston, CEO of Premier Art Holdings Ltd. Details of the Offering The initial tranche will be $50 million, marking the initial phase of this innovative program, with additional tranches planned for the future. Initially, TPAT tokens will be available exclusively to accredited investors. The pre-sale is scheduled for December, with public trading to follow. About Premier Art Holdings Ltd. Premier Art Holdings Ltd. is dedicated to democratizing fine art investment through the tokenization of prestigious artwork collections into one cumulative Asset Portfolio that will be exhibited to the viewing public. About Chintai Nexus Chintai is redefining finance through its compliance-focused Layer-1 blockchain platform for tokenizing real-world assets. Chintai technology is purpose-built for institutional-grade tokenization of real-world assets. Its fully customizable white-label technology empowers financial institutions and SMEs to develop tailored digital asset solutions that support every phase of the trade lifecycle. Powered by the innovative CHEX token, the Chintai platform combines the advantages of blockchain with the familiarity of a traditional investment experience.

37261471,https://nulltx.com/?p=135264,1733423764,Why Solana Could Explode 100x As Market Gears Up For A Bull Run Amidst JetBolt Spike,"Currently priced at $234.20, Solana (SOL) is gearing up for explosive growth, with crypto analysts forecasting it could hit 100x returns in the next bull run. Driven by its unmatched scalability and lightning-fast transactions, Solana’s surge further cements its place as a market leader. Meanwhile, JetBolt (JBOLT) is also shaking up the crypto space with its groundbreaking blockchain technology and game-changing presale. JetBolt’s ecosystem, already fully functional even during presale, is redefining what’s possible in crypto, pulling attention—and action—from crypto whales. As Solana’s momentum surges and JetBolt’s presale success redefines whale strategies, these two crypto powerhouses are reshaping the future of blockchain. Could Solana’s rise to 100x and JetBolt’s zero-gas revolution be setting the stage for the biggest crypto shakeup of the year? Let’s dive deeper. Can Solana Truly Explode 100x? Breaking Down the Facts Solana (SOL) is currently buzzing with predictions of 100x growth, but how realistic is this forecast? At press time, Solana trades at $234.20, up 44% over the last month. With a market cap of $110.29 billion and strong trading volumes, Solana remains one of the top contenders in the crypto space. Based on Solana’s 7-day trading chart, SOL has demonstrated a rollercoaster of volatility, ranging between $215 and $240, as bulls and bears fiercely contend for control ahead of its next big move. Crypto analysts predict resistance levels at $283, $328, and $438 for Solana, with $400+ achievable in the short term. Solana (SOL) 7-day price chart from CoinMarketCap showing volatile movements between $215 and $240 What makes Solana unique? Its Proof of History (PoH) technology that enables 65,000 transactions per second at an ultra-low cost of $0.00026 per transaction makes Solana a leader in scalability. Coupled with Grayscale’s spot Solana ETF filing, the network’s thriving ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and gaming dApps continues to attract developers and institutions. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also surged from $6 billion to $8.9 billion in just two months, making it the second-largest blockchain by TVL. However, challenges like regulatory uncertainty and competition from Ethereum’s upgrades could slow Solana’s growth. Solana’s fundamentals may be strong, but a 100x growth would require an unprecedented $10 trillion market cap. Whether it can truly reach such heights remains uncertain. Meanwhile, JetBolt (JBOLT) is making waves of its own with its zero-gas technology and outstanding blockchain capabilities that’s turning heads across the crypto market. JetBolt (JBOLT): The Zero-Gas Revolution That’s Becoming A Whale Favorite JetBolt (JBOLT) is emerging as a bold contender in the crypto space, swiftly gaining traction with its groundbreaking features and soaring presale. Designed with zero-gas technology, JetBolt leverages the Skale Network to eliminate gas fees entirely. This makes JetBolt the ideal choice for users prioritizing accessibility and scalability, addressing long-standing pain points in blockchain transactions. This innovation doesn’t just cut gas costs—it shatters the barriers holding back innovation, unlocking new possibilities for dApps, SocialFi, blockchain gaming, and Web3 by empowering developers to create and scale without limits. But it’s not just about accessibility—JetBolt takes utility to another level by delivering the latest, AI-curated crypto news and market data straight to its platform, helping JetBolt users stay updated in the fast-paced crypto landscape. On top of that, JetBolt’s easy-to-earn staking mechanism makes earning rewards effortless with its user-friendly Web3 wallet, empowering stakers to actively engage within the ecosystem and unlock benefits through meaningful collaboration and participation. JetBolt’s irresistible Alpha Boxes, which grant buyers up to 25% additional JBOLT tokens for batch purchases, are turning heads during the presale. As of writing, over 100 million JBOLT tokens have already been snapped up by early buyers, with whales moving swiftly to secure their share of this groundbreaking altcoin. With its fully operational ecosystem already live during presale, JetBolt is proving that it’s more than just hype. As the crypto community seeks bold advancements and transformative technology, JetBolt isn’t just making waves—it’s redefining the future of blockchain, one zero-gas transaction at a time. In Summary: Solana’s Surge Meets JetBolt’s Momentum As Solana (SOL) climbs toward a possible surge, its strong fundamentals and market activity keep it at the center of crypto buzz. Meanwhile, JetBolt’s (JBOLT) presale success, fueled by its groundbreaking technology and plethora of innovative features, is reeling in whales to its ecosystem. With Solana breaking barriers and JetBolt redefining blockchain possibilities, the crypto market is entering a transformative phase—one where the next big move could reshape everything.

Morgan's wisdom: ""I made my fortune by selling too early."" Markets operate on a simple yet powerful psychological truth: Fear and greed drive behaviour. At the bottom of an asset’s range, nobody wants to buy; fear reigns supreme. At the top, euphoria takes over, and everyone piles in, desperate not to miss out. This emotional cycle is the essence of market dynamics, and right now, crypto investors need to focus on it. When prices rise, contrary to textbook wisdom, they attract more buyers. Momentum builds, trends strengthen, and prices climb further. Conversely, when prices fall, selling pressure mounts as investors rush to avoid deeper losses. The result? Markets overshoot in both directions. At the bottom, sellers are exhausted and sell volume dries up. The brave buyers swoop in, forcing prices higher as demand outstrips supply. At the top, the inverse happens: buyers are tapped out, leaving prices vulnerable to the slightest nudge. A single significant sale can trigger panic, and the ensuing rush for the exits drives prices down sharply. We’ve seen this play out in crypto before as we’ve witnessed for a quarter of a millennia in equities. And now, we’re nearing the top of the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rally and therefore the crypto rally at large. The Case for the Top in Bitcoin Some believe Bitcoin has no ceiling. Maybe they’re right. But let’s be realistic: every bull market has its limits. The key question isn’t if there’s a top but where . During the last cycle, the bottom was the focal point—I called $13,000 from highs in the $60,000s, though it landed closer to $18,000. Now, Bitcoin has smashed through $100,000. Is this the top? Probably not. Could it reach $110,000-$120,000? Sensible. $150,000? Not impossible. But $200,000 or more? That’s speculative territory where dreams and reality diverge. Here’s the bottom line: The era of 5x returns in this cycle is over. At this stage, gains are likely in the 20%-50% range—solid but not life-changing. Meanwhile, a post-top crash could easily wipe out 50% or more. We’re no longer in accumulation territory; this is a risk management country. Strategy for Navigating the Top When prices hit extremes, the playbook is simple: Dollar Cost Average (DCA). At the bottom, DCA in. Near the top, DCA out. Gradual moves help manage emotions and smooth out volatility. I see $100,000 as the beginning of the end of this Bitcoin cycle, where the end is the top of that sequence of boom bubble bust. Whether you leave early or late in the boom bubble, the outcome is ultimately similar—as long as you exit. The real risk is staying too long and watching profits evaporate. Here’s how different types of market participants might approach this stage: True Believers : Hardcore HODLers won’t flinch if Bitcoin halves in value. Their faith is unwavering—they’ll hold through thick and thin, convinced of a 10x, even a 100x future. Trading isn’t their game; they’ll happily scoop up more on the next dip. Investors : Those who bought near the last bottom should eye the exit. The focus is maximising profits by trying to sell at the perfect moment. It’s a tough ask. Traders : This group thrives on volatility. They’re chasing explosive meme and altcoin moves on chains like Solana (SOL-USD), Base, or wherever the frothy madness is strongest, riding the last wave of euphoria. You think NFTs are dead? Think again. For traders, this phase is a goldmine, but timing is critical; opportunities will flash in and out within days or even hours. Obsessive Watchers : If you wake up at 3 a.m. to check the BTC price, it’s time to sell. Offload a bit with every sleepless night until you find peace. Caution is the watchword I’ve shared Bitcoin projections for years, and this rally has played out much as anticipated, you might even read some of my older posts here . I’ve stuck to the premise that the last Bitcoin cycle - and the one before -will closely repeat this time, and here we are. This is a chart I drew here in July when I wrote this: “ It will take new technical developments for crypto plus a Trump in the Whitehouse to bring back that old magic, but they are both in the realm of probabilities rather than certainty. The market knows this, which is why it is hesitating at these levels. I feel I can say, if Bitcoin breaks $80,000, it will break $100,000 .” ADVFN Trump won and the Bulls took control, and the trajectory is clear—but remember, we’re now dealing with percentages, not multiples. As mainstream FOMO kicks into high gear, the writing is on the wall. This is the signal to prepare your exit. As J.P. Morgan famously said, “I made my fortune by selling too early.” And when FOMO whispers in your ear, remind yourself that another opportunity is always just around the corner. The game isn’t won until you leave the casino with more cash than you brought in. Make your plan, stick to it, and don’t let greed be your undoing. Of course, this is easier said than done because as they still say in the markets, ‘it’s easy to confuse your brains with a bull market.’ I often do.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742413-bitcoin-onwards-to-the-top-managing-the-endgame?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37261417.jpeg

37261492,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623417,1733423487,Worksport set to adopt Bitcoin and XRP for corporate treasury,"Worksport is planning to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (Ripple) to align with growing global trends in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. The company is preparing to update investors on its holiday sales trends in the coming days, pending the launch of a portable power system and solar truck cover, In a press statement released on December 5, the US-based manufacturer announced its plan to purchase up to $5 million in Bitcoin and XRP, with a strict cap of 10% of excess operational cash for these cryptocurrency acquisitions. Worksport will begin accepting crypto payments on its e-commerce platform, expanding payment options for customers and increasing convenience. The company highlighted that cryptocurrency transactions could reduce transaction processing fees by up to 37%. Energy solutions company unveils crypto buying strategy Worksport’s newly adopted cryptocurrency strategy includes several key components designed to integrate digital assets into the company’s operations and financial framework. First, the company plans to allocate up to 10% of any excess operational cash toward purchasing Bitcoin and XRP. This strategy allows Worksport to diversify its treasury while maintaining financial stability. The manufacturer is seemingly looking for more ways to enhance customer convenience by expanding payment options but is also expected to reduce transaction processing fees. It also aims to convert interest earnings from cash held in money market accounts into Bitcoin and XRP. CEO Steven Rossi shared his thoughts on the company’s adoption of cryptocurrencies. He stated, “Our upcoming adoption of Bitcoin and XRP reflects our commitment to staying ahead of market trends while prioritizing operational efficiency and shareholder value. As we expand our product offerings and global reach, cryptocurrency has the potential to be a strong strategic complement.” Bitcoin surge to fuel institutional crypto adoption Worksport’s crypto adoption announcement comes after Bitcoin managed to surpass the $100,000 mark amid the ongoing crypto market bull run. The king crypto by market cap is currently changing hands at values slightly over $101,000, an increase of 5.3% in the last 24 hours, per the latest statistics from Coingecko. Analysts believe the coin could be pushing towards the $105K level. The bullish momentum also signals a potential run toward the $120K region in the short term, as the overall market structure remains strong. Bitcoin’s daily chart indicates a continued upward trend, reflecting growing investor confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value. However, the Relative Strength Index has entered the overbought region once again, suggesting that Bitcoin may be reaching short-term exhaustion. Additionally, the 200-day moving average, which currently sits near the $70K level, lags behind the current price. This combination of factors suggests the possibility of a price correction in the near future, which could offer a buying opportunity for those looking to enter at a lower price point. Major financial institutions and corporate investors have been progressively adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Galaxy Digital have been prominent buyers, recognizing the digital asset’s potential as a safeguard against economic uncertainty. XRP price drops as Ripple’s stablecoin launch looms Contrary to BTC’s price upward trajectory, XRP has witnessed a downturn in the last 24 hours, dropping 8% to trade at $2.34 at press time, per Coingecko data. The coin’s downward movement is part of a broader correction that began on December 3, which has seen the digital asset lose 25% of its value from a multi-year high of $2.90. XRP’s RSI has shown a clear shift, dropping from overbought conditions of 82 to 52 between December 3 and December 5. This shift indicates weakening momentum and suggests the potential for further downside if the RSI continues to decline. Should this downward trend persist, the chances of a deeper pullback increase, potentially pushing XRP toward key support levels. Meanwhile, the coin’s developer, Ripple Labs, is preparing to launch its United States dollar-pegged stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), pending the approval of financial regulator New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The technology company initially set the launch date to December 4 but later announced it had been postponed through its official X account. Source: X In the post, Ripple stated it is focused on launching RLUSD under the oversight of NYDFS and will maintain the “highest regulatory standards.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/worksport-to-adopt-btc-and-xrp-for-treasury/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37261492.jpeg

But can this meme coin evolve beyond its hype-driven roots to achieve the staggering 1000% rally many are hoping for? Alongside Shiba Inu’s resurgence, JetBolt (JBOLT) is turning heads with its zero-gas technology and explosive presale performance, positioning itself as a game-changer in the blockchain world.

Will JetBolt’s cutting-edge utility steal the spotlight? How will JetBolt’s growth impact the crypto space? Read on to find out. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Will SHIB Surge 1000% In Bull Run? Shiba Inu has always thrived on community support and market hype, but its future depends on more than just excitement. Today, SHIB is trading at $0.0000301, reflecting a monthly gain of 77.05%. While these gains are impressive, the idea of a 1000% surge feels ambitious—at least in the short term. Shiba Inu’s Monthly Price Chart: A 77.05% surge reflects renewed market interest and bullish momentum. Source: CoinMarketCap. For Shiba Inu to achieve such growth, it will need to replicate the conditions that drove its 2021 rally and adapt to a more competitive market. Back then, SHIB rode a wave of social media frenzy and meme coin enthusiasm. Its rise was unprecedented, but the market has since matured. Now, Shiba Inu must rely on tangible advancements, like ecosystem growth and improved utility. Efforts like the 3,162% spike in burn rate, which reduces the circulating supply, show that the community is committed to driving long-term value. However, whale activity paints a mixed picture, with large holders reducing their positions in recent weeks, signaling caution. Technically, Shiba Inu faces resistance at $0.000031. Breaking through this level could trigger a rally to $0.00004, but the path is far from certain. An anticipated influx of 33.7 trillion SHIB into the market could add volatility, making the next few weeks critical. However, SHIB isn’t the only token capturing attention. JetBolt, with its presale achievements and innovative blockchain solutions, is shaping up as a potential disruptor in this bullish phase. JetBolt (JBOLT) Surges: What’s Driving Its Growth?

37261820,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317205,1733423139,PEPE Whale Buys 337 Billion Tokens – Could This Signal a Massive Price Rally?,"As the Pepe Coin price consolidates either side of the $0.000020 level in wake of its mid-November surge, PEPE Whales are taking the opportunity to drastically increase their allocations, which could signal an incoming price surge. Per a tweet on X from on-chain analysis account @lookonchain, one PEPE whale has withdrawn over 337 billion tokens from Binance worth nearly $7 million in the past 20 days. Whales continue to accumulate $PEPE ! A whale has withdrawn 337.09B $PEPE ($6.92M) from #Binance in the past 20 days. https://t.co/65vbIQd2dd pic.twitter.com/79NauAQt8V — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 4, 2024 That marries up nicely with data from coinglass.com , which shows that exchange wallets have consistently seen PEPE outflow since the mid-November price pump. All of the above is suggestive of increased appetite to HODL, suggestive that another leg higher could be just around the corner for Pepe. Whales, including PEPE whales, are generally viewed as smart money in the crypto space. When they start making big moves, that’s a sign that the risk-reward at current price levels is very strong. As PEPE Whales Accumulate, Could a Rally Be Around the Corner? Unsurprisingly, PEPE whales appear to be making moves just ahead of another potential surge in the Pepe Coin price. Bitcoin (BTC) just flew above $100,000 for the first time ever but, with Bitcoin dominance now in a strong downtrend, we appear to have also entered a new altcoin season. So far, some of the best-performing altcoins have been coins like XRP and ADA . But rotation back into meme coins, who have performed well throughout most mob 2024, could come soon. PEPE would be a strong candidate to receive renewed inflows, as was the case in mid-November when it was listed on Coinbase. Pepe (PEPE) is now live on https://t.co/CD3RBjtMAO & in the Coinbase iOS & Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets. https://t.co/676miKRrfh — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) November 13, 2024 The leading meme coin’s chart technicals certainly look nice. PEPE saw a nice bounce in late November at $0.000017 from its previous record highs. And the meme coin has mostly been able to hold above its 21DMA. Risks thus remain tilted towards a further breakout towards new record levels. With a market cap of around $9.2 billion, few would be surprised to see PEPE rallying 5x from current levels to a market cap of $45 billion this bull cycle. That would hand the PEPE whales massive gains. Better Alternative to Pepe? Most investors would be over the moon with 5x gains in any asset. But this is crypto. And in crypto, there are a lot of degens hunting for nothing less than the next 100x gem to take them from rags to riches. Due to its “lack” of upside potential, Pepe might not appeal to these investors that much. One of the best ways to bag 100x gains is to get into a new meme coin project early and before it really starts trending. One of the best ways to do this is by getting into a high-potential meme coin at the presale stage. Analysts at cryptonews.com keep a close eye on the meme coin presale market and one gem they think has huge potential is a just-launched project called Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) . In just a few days, WEPE has already been able to raise over $880,000 and experts across the industry are already weighing in to support the project. 99Bitcoins analyst Jacob Crypto Bury just released a video predicting WEPE has 100x upside potential.

37262024,https://invezz.com/?p=2371027,1733422923,South Korea has no plans to allow corporate crypto trading,"South Korean regulators have denied reports about plans to gradually allow corporate cryptocurrency accounts, clarifying that discussions with banks and other stakeholders are ongoing. The FSC, while acknowledging that such plans are under consideration, clarified that no immediate roadmap has been finalised for the implementation of corporate cryptocurrency accounts. Corporate cryptocurrency accounts are specialised bank accounts designed for organisations and businesses to manage cryptocurrency-related transactions, such as trading, custody, or converting digital assets into fiat currencies, within a regulated framework. Per a December 4 statement , the plans to allow non-profit and corporate bodies to open such accounts are currently under review. The regulator clarified that it is consulting with banks, government agencies, financial institutions, and industry experts through platforms such as the Virtual Asset Committee, a regulatory advisory body established earlier this year, to address the matter. Further, the commission added that any steps taken would prioritise transparency and compliance with anti-money laundering guidelines while ensuring that broader adoption does not destabilise financial markets or encourage speculative behaviour. The rumors According to the reports in question, the FSC had finalised a roadmap to gradually allow corporate cryptocurrency accounts through a multi-phased approach. The roadmap, would allegedly lay the foundation for integrating crypto into the South Korean financial system. Unnamed sources in the report claimed the move was influenced by global developments, particularly in the United States, where President Donald Trump had announced plans to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The report further alleged that the first phase would allow real-name accounts for local governments, universities, and public institutions. As an immediate benefit, it would allow such organisations to convert donated cryptocurrencies into cash for operational use. While, the second phase would involve allowing crypto exchanges and related businesses to open won-denominated accounts in a bid to support the development of the crypto sector by opening doors to services like issuance, brokerage, and custody. For general corporations and financial institutions, the roadmap suggested a longer-term review. Safeguards, such as limiting the percentage of crypto holdings for listed companies, were reportedly under consideration to keep the market in check. South Korea’s cautious approach In South Korea , the current regulatory framework permits locals to engage in cryptocurrency trading through real-name bank accounts. However, corporate entities, including non-profit organizations and financial institutions, face restrictions in this area. On the other hand, some cryptocurrency exchanges have come under fire as the nation continues to strictly monitor all cryptocurrency-related activities. Last month, the Financial Intelligence Unit launched an investigation into the nation’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, for potential KYC violations. Amid this backdrop, South Korea is mulling the introduction of a crypto tax law that would impose a 20% tax on cryptocurrency gains exceeding 2.5 million won (around $1,800), along with an additional 2% local income tax on applicable profits. Originally slated for enforcement in 2021, the law has faced a lot of opposition from industry stakeholders and lawmakers, leading to its postponement until 2027.

37261819,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316659,1733422885,Floki Holders Back Pepe Presale After $72 Million Raised – Could This Be the Next Breakout?,"Floki ($FLOKI), the top-ten meme coin and Telegram trading bot inspired by Elon Musk’s pet Shiba Inu of the same name, is falling behind other leading meme coins amidst a market-wide rally that began after Bitcoin ($BTC) crossed the $100,000 threshold in the early hours UTC. Bitcoin is still climbing too. The original and world-leading $2 trillion cap cryptocurrency shot up 7.9% overnight and now stands at an impressive $103,523, which is a hairs breadth away (0.6%) from surpassing an all-time high of $103,679 set 12 hours ago. Bitcoin is effectively bootstrapping the entire market today. Crypto’s $142 billion meme coin sector shot up 10% overnight, with sector progenitor and OG Good Boy Dogecoin ($DOGE) up 9.3% to change hands at $0.4503. Its closest contender, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) rallied 5.9%, while Pepe ($PEPE) the frog surged 6.4%. Floki lags behind all of them with modest gains of 3.5% overnight to trade at $0.0002408. Still, it managed to beat both DogWifHat ($WIF) and Bonk ($BONK) , which rose 0.7% and 1.6% respectively. Where is Floki ($FLOKI) headed next? Floki is in a healthy position to get further gains over the Christmas period. The token currently trades slightly below its thirty-day moving average, although this will likely converge overnight as steady buying continues apace. Floki’s relative strength index (RSI) is at 61 and rising, and rarely has the token strayed into the overbought territory of 70 over the last three months. This indicates a consistent balance between buy and sell orders that has helped the market to price the token adequately over the period. Floki’s team also recently gave $FLOKI added functionality with a new trading bot that has already executed 60,492 trades with a combined volume of $118,767,013.14 across 705,102 users. This ultimately sets it apart from similar-sized rivals like DogWifHat and Brett, which exist solely for entertainment, speculation and transactions. Traders exit Floki for biggest meme coin presale ever One of the reasons Floki is not doing so well right now is because there is a new alternative meme coin that has raised an unprecedented $73 million in investments. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) entered presale this summer with the simple premise that it’s the first Pepe to run on a proprietary Ethereum Layer 2. Ethereum is the most commercially important blockchain, but it currently processes about 15 transactions per second (tps) which results in high network congestion and large transaction fees. To solve this bottleneck, Layer 2 protocols sit on top of the main Ethereum network and process transactions independently on a side chain, before adding them to the Layer 1 ledger. This makes $PEPU a hundred times quicker and cheaper to transact with than Ethereum, or Floki ($FLOKI) for that matter, and the developers are building a whole ecosystem around it. POV: Pepe’s reading his notes on the L2. Needless to say, he’s very excited for everyone to see it! pic.twitter.com/PaCBGhsWQA — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 3, 2024 Two key features in Pepe Unchained’s ecosystem expansion drive include its very own Layer 2 blockchain with a decentralized exchange (DEX) for cheap swaps between $PEPU and supported tokens, alongside a Pepe Foundation, which will help fund “an entire ecosystem with the best developers in the space contributing.” Additionally, there is a dedicated block explorer to see all transactions on Layer 2 and a Pepe Unchained bridge for instant and low-cost bridging between Pepe Unchained and Ethereum’s Layer 1. Pepe Unchained, the $PEPE killer, is now sold out, but it will be hitting exchanges soon, where it could easily surpass Floki’s $FLOKI in popularity.

Crypto Projects like Sui (SUI), Sei (SEI), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Injective (INJ), and BlockDAG (BDAG) compete for the top position. These crypto networks are reshaping the crypto narrative with unique approaches to decentralization, scalability, and real-world adoption. This guide examines these 5 crypto coins, their pricing, future predictions, technological ecosystems, and growth trajectories to identify what makes them the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Whether it is BlockDAG’s presale success or Injective’s AI integration, each coin brings a distinct value proposition. By analyzing these projects in depth, it is easy to uncover the strongest potential for which can be the best buy in December 2024. 1. BlockDAG Rockets Past $157M Presale Mark The BlockDAG presale has crossed the $157 million milestone, with over 16.8 billion coins sold to date. Now, in batch 26, the BDAG coin is priced at $0.0234. This reveals a 2240% increase from its initial batch 1 price.

This growth is underpinned by an expanding DeFi ecosystem, with total value locked (TVL) reaching $1.75 billion before stabilizing at $1.64 billion. Such a rapid increase signals growing utility, with assets locked for staking, lending, and liquidity provision. Technical indicators highlight mixed short-term signals, as BBTrend suggests caution, but strong EMA alignment supports the coin's underlying market structure. 3. Sei Gains Momentum with Rising TVL and Growth Sei is another one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 for offering low-latency and high-speed transaction capabilities. Recently, its Total Value Locked (TVL) has seen a significant uptick, and the platform has experienced increased daily active users, signalling growing trust. Sei is currently trading at $0.6683, having broken a critical resistance level. Analysts predict a potential rise to $2, with bullish scenarios targeting $10 if momentum continues. Designed to optimize liquidity and enable rapid settlements, Sei’s ecosystem supports trading and high-frequency applications. 4. Bitcoin Cash Rises with Practical Utility Focus Bitcoin Cash, known for prioritizing practicality over Bitcoin’s prestige, is currently trading at $505, reflecting a 32.9% monthly increase. Positioned as a decentralized payment solution, BCH appeals to businesses aiming to avoid high traditional payment fees. Recent $3.13 billion institutional inflows into crypto, driven by Bitcoin ETFs, have strengthened BCH's performance. Although it faced resistance at $555 last week, BCH's real-world utility secures its place as a key player in decentralized payments. 5. Injective Advances DeFi with AI Integration Injective is attracting momentum in blockchain innovation, trading at $32.38 after a 7% daily and 17% weekly price increase. Known for advancing DeFi and AI integration, Injective’s recent iAgent SDK launch has attracted significant attention. This tool allows for the integration of AI within DeFi applications, enhancing automation and functionality. The market’s response highlights growing confidence in Injective’s ability to push technological boundaries. By combining decentralisation with advanced AI, Injective reinforces its role as a leading DeFi protocol. The Top Pick Revealed: Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 The search for the best crypto to buy in December undoubtedly ends at BlockDAG, which is smashing records with its $157 million. Its growing ecosystem, driven by innovation and usability, adds further strength to its trajectory.

37261241,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51459,1733422692,"ChatGPT Sets Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price For December 31, 2024","Shiba Inu (SHIB), a popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, continues to draw attention with recent price predictions and significant market activity. According to ChatGPT, SHIB could climb approximately 25% from its current value to reach $0.00004 by December 31, 2024. At the time of press, SHIB is trading at $0.00003175, reflecting a 4.83% gain in the past 24 hours. ChatGPT’s forecast is bolstered by recent on-chain developments and historical parallels that suggest the token might experience a notable upward trend as 2024 unfolds. ChatGPT’s Prediction: A 25% Upsurge ChatGPT explained that the projected SHIB price is driven by several key factors, including robust community support, ongoing developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and broader market trends favoring altcoins. It highlighted: “SHIB’s price movement reflects a steady increase in investor confidence, driven by strategic withdrawals from exchanges and reduced selling pressure. These factors align with historical precedents where similar patterns have led to significant price gains.” This projection comes amid increased activity within the Shiba Inu network, further fueling optimism. Massive Exchange Withdrawals Highlight Bullish Sentiment Supporting ChatGPT’s prediction is a recent revelation from Lucie, Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead. She disclosed that over 1.6 trillion SHIB tokens were withdrawn from exchanges in a single day, an event confirmed by data analytics platform Santiment. The corresponding Santiment chart showed a sharp spike in SHIB’s exchange outflows alongside a slight price uptick. Lucie explained that large-scale withdrawals often indicate reduced selling pressure as investors transfer assets to private wallets, signaling a long-term holding strategy. Historically, similar patterns have preceded substantial price increases. Lucie also compared the current market conditions to the period preceding SHIB’s meteoric rise in 2021 , adding credibility to the bullish outlook. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historical Context: Lessons from 2020 and 2021 Shiba Inu’s performance over the years provides an insightful context for its current trajectory. Launched in August 2020, SHIB traded at an almost negligible price, carrying ten zeros after the decimal point. On November 28, 2020, the token recorded its all-time low (ATL) at $0.000000000056. Despite its slow start, SHIB gained massive traction in 2021, fueled by increased demand, major exchange listings, and large-scale token burns. These factors triggered an explosive rally, turning early investors into millionaires. Lucie emphasized the resemblance between today’s market dynamics and those observed before SHIB’s 2021 surge, suggesting the potential for history to repeat itself. With ChatGPT predicting a 25% price increase by year-end, notable on-chain activity, and ecosystem advancements, Shiba Inu’s outlook appears optimistic.

37261040,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373501,1733422685,"Fed Chair Likens Bitcoin to Gold, Says It’s Not a Rival to the Dollar","Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could replace the U.S. dollar, likening the cryptocurrency to gold as a speculative asset rather than a store of value. Powell shared these views during his appearance at The New York Times DealBook Summit in Manhattan. Powell’s Argument When asked whether Bitcoin’s popularity reflects a lack of faith in the U.S. dollar or the Federal Reserve, Powell said , “I don’t think that’s how people think about it.” He went on to describe Bitcoin as a highly volatile asset used for speculation rather than as a stable store of value. “It’s just like gold, only it’s virtual,” Powell said. “It’s very volatile, it’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold.” These remarks come at a time of heightened speculation about Bitcoin’s role in global finance. It has seen a significant price rise in recent weeks, driving its market capitalization to over $2 trillion. According to CompaniesMarketCap.com, the cryptocurrency is now the seventh-largest asset globally. Bitcoin ranks behind gold, which has an estimated market value of $18 trillion, and five major American companies, including Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta. Powell’s conservative stance on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is consistent with his previous statements. In 2021, he similarly criticized Bitcoin for its volatility, arguing that it failed to serve as a reliable store of value or medium of exchange. At the time, he referred to all cryptocurrencies as speculative investments that would not replace the dollar but could rival gold as an alternative asset. Following the 71-year-old’s reappointment as Federal Reserve Chair in 2021, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz expressed concerns, stating that his leadership would likely hinder market growth. “People are getting pretty bearish on crypto,” Novogratz said at the time. Concerns Under Powell’s Leadership Under Biden’s administration, the Federal Reserve has been accused of playing a key role in “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged effort to stop the growth of the U.S. cryptocurrency industry by cutting crypto firms’ access to traditional banking services. In August 2024, these allegations were reignited after the Fed directed Customers Bank, a crypto-friendly institution, to tighten its risk management and compliance measures. This prompted Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss to declare that Operation Chokepoint 2.0 “is alive and well.” Crypto’s banking issues began years ago, intensifying after the collapse of FTX, which triggered stricter regulations against blockchain companies. This included mandates from the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve that discouraged banks from serving crypto firms. As a result of this, many crypto-friendly banks like Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank have since been forced to close.

37261431,https://blockworks.co/news/ledn-ceo-on-crypto-backed-lending-boom,1733422623,Ledn CEO details path to crypto-backed lending boom,"I recently chatted with Ledn CEO Adam Reeds about crypto-backed loans. Spoiler: He expects the category could exponentially boom. One thing he mentioned to me was, “Price is the best marketer.” BTC’s price rose nearly 40% in November — fueled by the victory of pro-bitcoin Donald Trump and scores of crypto-friendly Congressional candidates. It more recently broke the $103,000 barrier. Ledn, for much of this year, did roughly $1 million per day of crypto-backed collateral financing (mostly BTC). This allows clients to borrow cash without having to sell their BTC or ETH. The company was doing about 2.5x that amount in November, Reeds noted. “The last cycle institutions did the work and they said this is interesting, what about this bitcoin thing?” he said. “Things take time. You’re in an organization with several hundred or several thousand people; you don’t build consensus overnight.” Read more: Bitcoin sets new all-time high above $100K Reeds noted previously seeing retail investors with FOMO (fear of missing out) on crypto. This time the institutions seem to be feeling that fear, the CEO added. Financial services giant Cantor Fitzgerald said in July that it planned to launch a bitcoin financing business. CEO Howard Lutnick, recently selected by Donald Trump to lead the Commerce Department , said at the time the firm intended to launch with $2 billion of lending. Reeds said he estimates the global bitcoin-backed loan market ( on the retail side ) to currently be between $1 billion and $2 billion. “The analogy I like is, ‘What if this was like real estate mortgages on the residential side?’” Reeds said. “Well, 60% of homes have a mortgage on them, and what if 60% of bitcoin effectively had a mortgage on it? Suddenly the market’s like $400 billion.” “That’s with bitcoin at $95,000,” he added. “What if bitcoin’s at $250,000? All of these things start to change.” Keep reading for more excerpts from Blockworks’ interview with Reeds. Blockworks: What has changed at Ledn since the US election ? Reeds: We have been approaching more traditional credit funds that would, for example, finance student loan packages — things like that, that are more alternatives. I would say the gap we’re seeing is that in this market pullback over the last couple years (post-Covid), there was a lot of attractive yield opportunities. So even though institutions kind of get that bitcoin is a pretty safe [asset] (the ones that are forward-thinking), there’s still so much attractive yield to go after…that it’s a bit challenging to say this is why you should finance bitcoin. But that’s changing. I think as the interest rates come down a bit, now we’re starting to see more interest because people are a bit worried that they’re not going to get the same yield opportunities they did over the last 24 months. Blockworks: Why are more traditional finance players beginning to recognize bitcoin as good collateral? Reeds: Obviously regulatory clarity . But I think specifically on the financial side, people [are] getting smart about how to fit it in in traditional buckets. Most institutions have rules and allocations as to where they can place capital, and it’s hard for them to just buy physical bitcoin. What MicroStrategy is doing is really smart in saying, ‘OK well there’s a pool of capital out here that can buy convertible bonds. And there’s another pool of capital here that can be MicroStrategy equity. And if I allocate that appropriately … I can maximize how much I can attract in the markets by sizing it and pricing it accordingly.’ So they’re getting really smart about that, and I think we’re excited to do the same thing on the pure lending side, because we’re spending a lot of time thinking about how we tap into more traditional financial setups. Read more: CME data suggests institutions are field-testing new crypto moves Blockworks: What might be some other outstanding obstacles for institutions looking to get more involved in the crypto space? Reeds: I think the biggest thing that gets in the way is the information knowledge gap on some pretty basic stuff. For example, custody is not standardized. The next closest thing is saying these are custodians that the ETFs use. And if the [US Securities and Exchange Commission] has approved them for ETF custodians, then that’s pretty safe and we’re using the same custodians; Ledn uses BitGo. But there’s no stamp on the custodian that says this is the Grade-A custodian, this is the Grade B. And that’s what [traditional finance] needs; [traditional finance] needs someone else to say this is OK so that they feel OK with it. So I think we’re forcing them to think about too many things, which is adding friction to the equation. And the same goes with liquidity providers or trading venues. I think that’s where regulation will help, and just more news. If you can say, ‘OK maybe it’s not regulated, but Cantor [Fitzgerald] did it this way,’ then it adds credibility to the explanation in the way we’re getting it done. Blockworks: What might be your price prediction for bitcoin long-term? Reeds: What’s interesting about it is…obviously there are fundamentals around user adoption and numbers like that, but there are no sales forecasts or traditional financial analysis of bitcoin. So if we push BTC to a price of $250,000, well then $150,000 is a bear market. Every time you have these new lows, then it hits a new step function and we get to the next level. So I don’t think $1 million is unreasonable. A modified version of this article first appeared in Tuesday’s Forward Guidance newsletter. Subscribe here so you don’t miss tomorrow’s edition.

""USDC is the first stablecoin to achieve this milestone,"" the company said in a press statement. ""Circle continues to engage with Canadian authorities in their development of a regulated market for global stablecoins, which has the potential to bring significant efficiency gains to Canadian cross-border, retail, and institutional settlement systems.""  Circle's announcement happened as pressure mounts on crypto companies operating in the country to comply with stricter rules by the end of this year.  The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) started to roll out tighter regulations to govern digital assets last year, including guidelines for exchanges to offer so-called ""Value-Referenced Crypto Assets"" (VRCA) which encompasses stablecoins. In anticipation of the stricter rules, Binance exited the Canadian market, while Coinbase and Crypto.com announced to delist tokens including Tether's USDT, the largest stablecoin on the market of $135 billion capitalization, from their platforms.  The Ontario Securities Commission, member of the CSA, listed Circle Internet Financial on its website as so far the only issuer under the VRCA rules.

37261151,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623419,1733422308,From pizza to $100K – The crazy chronicles of Bitcoin’s meteoric rise,"Bitcoin smashed through the $100,000 barrier on Thursday, rewriting its own chaotic and unpredictable history. The record-breaking run was supercharged by Donald Trump’s election victory, with markets betting on a regulatory overhaul. Bitcoin has climbed over 140% this year, more than doubling from its January low of $38,505. The election has added over 50% to its value since Nov. 5. This monumental rise, though historic, didn’t happen overnight. Bitcoin’s journey is one of invention, defiance, crashes, and comebacks. From a $41 pizza order to becoming the face of a trillion-dollar market, its story is every bit as wild as its price chart. Now let’s take a walk back. From Satoshi to the Winklevoss twins Bitcoin was created in 2008 by an anonymous figure (or group) named Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was revolutionary:- Here was a digital currency that could operate without banks or governments. In 2010, Bitcoin made headlines when a Florida man spent 10,000 BTC to buy two Papa John’s pizzas. Those pizzas, now worth $1 billion, were the currency’s first retail transaction and cemented its place in financial history. In 2013, Bitcoin began attracting serious attention. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, known for their legal feud with Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook, took a shot at legitimizing Bitcoin. They filed the first-ever application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Around the same time, Grayscale Investments launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust, offering a new way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The SEC, however, was not happy. Over the years (before 2023), the Winklevoss twins adjusted their ETF applications multiple times, even naming State Street as an administrator. Despite these changes, their requests were rejected in 2017, and since then, they have not refiled or received new approval. Regulatory struggles and market crashes While Bitcoin fought for legitimacy, the crypto market was plagued with volatility. In 2020, Grayscale made progress by transforming its trust into a publicly traded entity. Though not an ETF, it became the first Bitcoin fund of its kind to be traded on public markets in the U.S. Meanwhile, Canada was leading the way, launching the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF in 2021. That same year, the SEC approved the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, the first Bitcoin futures-based ETF. It broke records by accumulating $1 billion in assets within days. But this wasn’t what the crypto world had been waiting for. Spot ETFs remained elusive as the SEC continued rejecting applications, including a new one from Grayscale in 2022. Frustrated, Grayscale sued the SEC, marking a turning point in the battle for regulatory approval. At the same time, the market was dealing with internal chaos. 2022 saw a series of collapses, including major players like Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faced fraud charges as Bitcoin’s price plunged. Despite the turmoil, industry leaders like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco began filing applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, kickstarting a change in institutional confidence. The crypto president In 2023, Bitcoin began to recover. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, entered the ETF race, pushing Bitcoin’s price to a one-year high. Other players, including ARK Investments and CBOE Global Markets, joined the push. In August, Grayscale scored a major win when a federal appeals court ruled that the SEC had failed to justify its rejection of the company’s ETF application. This legal victory paved the way for change. By January 2024, the SEC finally approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s and Fidelity’s. Within a month, these funds attracted $4 billion in net inflows, reflecting the pent-up demand for Bitcoin-backed products. Bitcoin’s price soared, breaking $70,000 by March. Meanwhile, self-proclaimed ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump’s campaign rhetoric fueled the crypto market’s optimism. At a San Francisco fundraiser in June, he criticized Democrats for their restrictive stance on cryptocurrency. In July, he doubled down, promising at a Bitcoin conference to create a national Bitcoin stockpile if re-elected. His pro-crypto stance resonated with investors, pushing Bitcoin’s price higher. In October, the SEC granted accelerated approval for exchanges to list options tied to Bitcoin ETFs. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev captured the industry’s sentiment, saying , “This administration has been hostile to crypto, very much so. We’ve been kind of a victim of that alongside the broader industry. So having people that come in, that understand it and embrace it, is very important for the industry.” Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 is a story of resilience and evolution. As all this dust settles though, one thing is clear: Bitcoin isn’t ever going anywhere.

37260919,https://crypto.news/?p=14316638,1733422144,Sorry not sorry? Financial Times’ Alphaville issues apology for Bitcoin bashing,"The Financial Times’ Alphaville blog issued a rare, snarky, and semi-humorous apology to readers, addressing its longstanding skepticism toward Bitcoin. Since June 2011, Alphaville has consistently characterized Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a “negative-sum game” with limited utility, often describing its price as more reflective of hype than intrinsic value. But, with Bitcoin recently surpassing $100,000 , the publication issued a lighthearted apology for its previous coverage that may have deterred readers from investing. Hodlers: an apology https://t.co/aDJdYXuCQD — FT Alphaville (@FTAlphaville) December 5, 2024 In its apology, Alphaville acknowledged the impact its coverage may have had on readers’ investment decisions. “We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up,” the blog wrote, referencing Bitcoin’s meteoric price rise While standing by its critical analysis, Alphaville admitted its commentary may have unintentionally led readers to overlook Bitcoin’s potential for significant returns. You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs record fifth straight day of inflows as BTC surges past $100K to new ATH Bitcoin as an “arbitrary hype gauge” The apology maintained a blend of contrition and continued skepticism. Alphaville reiterated its view that Bitcoin, while “clever” as a protocol, remains inefficient as a means of exchange and is compromised as a store of value. “We stand by every single one of those posts,” FT wrote in reference to their past skeptical takes on Bitcoin. FT described Bitcoin’s price as an “arbitrary hype gauge,” disconnected from the cryptocurrency’s utility. Nonetheless, the publication conceded that readers might have misinterpreted its cynicism as an endorsement of traditional finance, which Alphaville clarified it does not support either.

This trend is manifesting itself as an increase in the “long-term owner spent output profit ratio” (LTH-SOPR), which measures the profitability of coins sold by long-term investors by comparing their selling price to the original purchase price. “Long-term investors have started to take profits as the Bitcoin price has climbed above $100,000,” said Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s Director of Research. “LTH-SOPR has risen to four on our charts, indicating that coins sold by long-term holders are making profits four times their original purchase price.” Moreno added that this behavior is typical during Bitcoin bull markets and that current profit-taking levels remain far from extreme. The activity of long-term holders is a key indicator during market rallies, which typically signal periods of consolidation or short-term corrections. CryptoQuant’s data shows that while profit-taking has increased, it does not signal panic selling or an imminent reversal. Related News: Can Bitcoin Maintain Its Support Level At $100,000 Or Is A Decline Coming? “This is a normal phenomenon during Bitcoin bull markets,” Moreno explained, adding: “The current profit-taking trend is at expected levels and we are not seeing the kind of extreme behavior typically seen before significant price declines.” The broader macroeconomic landscape could also play a role in Bitcoin’s trajectory, with Bitfinex Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner noting that the upcoming US employment report could have ripple effects on risk assets like Bitcoin. “Economists expect about 200,000 new jobs in November, rebounding from weak numbers in October caused by hurricanes and labor strikes,” Kooner said. “A strong jobs report could prompt the Fed to reconsider the pace of rate cuts, potentially opting for a more gradual approach. This scenario could strengthen the U.S. dollar and put downward pressure on risk assets, including Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

37260707,https://nulltx.com/?p=135250,1733421634,6 Best New Meme Coins to Invest in December 2024: BTFD Surges with Staking and P2E Highlights,"The meme coin market is absolutely buzzing right now. While traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum still dominate, meme coins have carved out a unique space in the crypto universe. Thanks to their humour, community-driven vibes, and massive growth potential, they’ve got everyone—from casual investors to crypto veterans—keeping a close eye on them. December 2024 is shaping up to be one heck of a month for meme coin enthusiasts, as new contenders are entering the scene with innovative projects and jaw-dropping presale performances. One standout star is BTFD Coin (BTFD), which has tapped into the meme coin mania in a big way. With a presale performance that’s already turning heads and exciting features like Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming and high-yield staking, it’s no wonder investors are hyped. Let’s break down why BTFD Coin and four other fresh meme coins deserve a spot on your radar. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) BTFD Coin is making serious waves. Launched with the slogan “Buy the Dip, Folks!”, this coin doesn’t just cash in on meme culture—it’s backed by solid utility. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game has gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike flocking to join the action, and the staking platform boasts a mouth-watering 90% APY. Oh, and did we mention the exclusive “Bulls Squad” community for holders? If you’re in, you’re part of a thriving, bullish club. The presale numbers speak for themselves. BTFD Coin’s journey kicked off on November 26, 2024, currently in Stage 7, the coin is priced at $0.000064, with over 23 billion tokens sold and more than $1,000,000 raised. If you’re considering jumping in now, here’s a fun thought experiment: Let’s say you invest $6,500. That’d get you around 101,562,500 BTFD Coins. If the price hits the listing target of $0.0006, you’re looking at a whopping $60,937.50. Not too shabby, right? Why did this coin make it to this list? Simple. BTFD Coin blends meme coin charm with real-world use cases, has a proven presale record, and offers one of the most attractive staking APYs in the market. Oh, and FOMO is real—don’t miss this train. 2. Brett Here’s a name you probably weren’t expecting: Brett. Yes, this meme coin embraces its inner simplicity with a comically unassuming name. But don’t let that fool you. Brett’s developers have crafted an ingenious narrative around a “friendly everyman” persona, symbolising accessibility and relatability. Community members even call themselves “Brettizens”—a quirky nod to their collective mission. Brett’s strongest play is its community-driven approach. Instead of relying on flashy ads or influencer hype, Brett taps into the grassroots vibe. In just a few weeks since its launch, the coin’s social media following has exploded, thanks to endless memes and relatable content. Plus, Brett’s tokenomics are designed to reward holders with frequent airdrops and liquidity incentives—a smart move to keep the Brettizens engaged. Why did this coin make it to this list? Brett’s combination of meme power, community vibes, and clever incentives makes it one to watch. If you’re craving something fresh and authentic, Brett’s got your back. 3. Popcat Remember the viral “Popcat” meme that had the internet losing its collective mind? Well, now it’s a cryptocurrency. Popcat’s creators took this nostalgic internet gem and turned it into a thriving crypto project. With a playful nod to its origins, the token leverages humour and nostalgia to pull in investors. Popcat isn’t just about the memes, though. It’s packed with utility. The token serves as a key to exclusive Popcat NFTs, which have been selling out faster than hotcakes. Moreover, the developers are working on a Popcat mobile game that promises to integrate cryptocurrency rewards. Think endless hours of fun plus the chance to earn some sweet Popcat tokens. The project’s roadmap is ambitious, but the team has been delivering on its promises so far. Why did this coin make it to this list? Popcat blends viral nostalgia with forward-thinking utility, making it a no-brainer for investors who love a good internet throwback. 4. Peanut the Squirrel If you’ve ever seen a squirrel hoarding nuts, you’ll get the idea behind Peanut the Squirrel. This meme coin is all about saving for the future—with a twist. Its tagline? “Stack your stash.” Peanut’s charm lies in its playful branding and its unique savings mechanism. Every transaction redistributes a portion of tokens back to holders, encouraging long-term holding. But there’s more to Peanut than meets the eye. The project is actively working on a financial literacy campaign aimed at teaching crypto newcomers the basics of saving and investing. It’s a clever way to tie in the “hoarding” theme with real-world education. Plus, the community’s memes? Absolutely nutty. (Pun intended.) Why did this coin make it to this list? Peanut the Squirrel offers a mix of clever branding, community engagement, and financial literacy initiatives. It’s not just about hoarding—it’s about building a better financial future. 5. Non-Playable Coin Gamers, listen up. Non-Playable Coin, or NPC, is a meme coin with a gaming twist. Its name takes a cheeky jab at the “non-playable characters” we all love to mock in video games. But unlike those NPCs, this coin is anything but static. With partnerships in the gaming world and plans for metaverse integration, NPC is aiming to be the go-to coin for gamers everywhere. The standout feature? NPC’s rewards system. Gamers can earn NPC tokens by completing challenges in partner games. The coin also boasts seamless integration with some of the most popular gaming platforms, making it super easy to earn and spend. If the devs can keep this momentum going, NPC could dominate the gaming-crypto crossover space. Why did this coin make it to this list? Non-Playable Coin is a gamer’s dream come true, blending meme coin fun with real-world gaming rewards. If you’re into gaming and crypto, this one’s a no-brainer. 6. Simon’s Cat Simon’s Cat is an internet classic, and now it’s a cryptocurrency too. Fans of the beloved animated series have rallied around this coin, turning it into a community-driven powerhouse. Simon’s Cat Coin capitalises on its existing fanbase while rolling out exclusive NFTs and collectibles that only holders can access. What really sets Simon’s Cat apart is its charity component. A portion of all transactions goes towards animal shelters and pet welfare organisations. It’s a feel-good aspect that resonates with pet lovers and investors alike. Plus, the community’s dedication to promoting animal welfare has sparked partnerships with major brands in the pet industry. Why did this coin make it to this list? Simon’s Cat combines nostalgia, community spirit, and a charitable mission, making it a standout choice for socially-conscious investors. Conclusion Meme coins are more than just a joke—they’re reshaping the crypto landscape. Whether you’re drawn to the innovative P2E mechanics of BTFD Coin, the quirky charm of Brett, or the nostalgia-packed punch of Popcat, there’s no shortage of exciting opportunities. And let’s not forget about the financial literacy boost from Peanut the Squirrel or the gaming potential of Non-Playable Coin. BTFD Coin, in particular, is leading the charge. With its stellar presale performance, high-yield staking, and engaging P2E game, it’s a prime example of where meme coins are headed. Don’t miss out—join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your slice of the action.

37260846,https://blockworks.co/news/programmable-yield-stablecoin-model,1733421600,M^0 and Noble set sights on Tether’s $136B empire,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . M^0, a decentralized stablecoin infrastructure layer, is setting a new standard for stablecoin design with its innovative modular architecture, revenue and distribution model. Its first distributor, Noble, is pulling back the curtain on the Noble dollar, USDN, in a bid to shake up the market and disrupt entrenched players. For the entire history of stablecoin issuance, Tether has been the dominant issuer. Its market share on Ethereum dipped to 30% in 2022 — following growth in Circle’s USDC and Binance’s BUSD — but thanks to its near monopoly on the Tron blockchain, Tether’s market cap has reigned supreme in the stablecoin space. With Tether ostensibly healthier than ever, it maintains a significant moat — but maybe not an insurmountable one. Robbie Petersen of Delphi Digital noted the importance of M^0’s approach in August, writing that “[M^0] could be best positioned to challenge the Tether monopoly .” A new framework Unlike traditional stablecoin issuers, M^0 operates a multi-issuer protocol, creating a decentralized system where issuers follow protocol rules rather than centralized mandates. Its canonical stablecoin, M, serves as a core building block for custom-branded stablecoins. Known as M-extensions, the Noble dollar is its first. This system offers issuers full programmability, allowing these branded M-extensions to distribute yield as they see fit — whether to liquidity pools, users or other stakeholders. According to Greg Di Prisco, co-founder of M^0, this structure provides scalability, safety and liquidity unmatched by traditional issuance models. “We don’t believe that [a centralized issuer model] can possibly scale. You can’t have one company controlling the entire world’s money supply as stablecoins continue to grow. So, we built a protocol that enables a multi-issuer process,” Di Prisco told Blockworks. Petersen noted the core issue in stablecoins today is that dapps “capture none of the value they create on behalf of stablecoin issuers.” Under M^0’s model, US Treasury yield can become “not only a meaningful source of revenue for apps, but possibly even the principal source.” This transformative potential could lead to a new business model, he argues: “Selling stablecoin distribution as a service (SDaaS).” Noble intends to pass on 100% of the USDN native yield to holders of the token — at least initially — according to Jelena Djuric, co-founder and CEO of Noble. “Our entire growth strategy has been keeping things as frictionless as possible,” Djuric told Blockworks, noting that Noble has no transaction fees to use any of its stablecoins. “We want to keep it like that, and the beauty [of] Cosmos and IBC is that it’s low fee and it’s fast — we wouldn’t want to compromise that in any way,” she said. Noble has previously been known for bringing USDC to IBC-connected chains, and generally improving the cross-chain routing of Circle’s stablecoins. But Djuric said USDN will complement USDC on the Noble chain, describing M^0 as “if Circle and MakerDAO [ now Sky ] joined forces and had a baby.” Modularity meets interoperability M^0 aims to meet the needs of appchains and fintech providers that want to launch their own branded stablecoins without worrying about the collateral backing, or interoperability — both are baked into the protocol underpinning M. “All of the collateral management is done for them,” Di Prisco said. “The big difference here between other [issuers] like Paxos …is that with Paxos, you’re going through months of negotiations, paperwork, legal documents, lawyers — [but] because we’re a protocol and fully onchain, [we] can give you your own branded stablecoin in minutes,” he said. Issuers maintain bankruptcy-remote SPVs , and are only allowed to hold 0-to-180-day T-bills that are marked to market. Their actual collateral balance is also checked daily. “They effectively can’t cheat as long as we maintain the right incentives in the ecosystem,” Di Prisco said. All M-extensions will be fungible by default, although brand partners have some leeway about exchanges with other distributors. For Noble, this modular design allows them to maintain a focus on ecosystem expansion. With the anticipated IBC Eureka upgrade — facilitating connections with non-Cosmos-based chains — plus integration into wormhole-supported chains, USDN will benefit from a large addressable market. “You want to go between Osmosis and dYdX in one click with two separate tokens? You can do that on Noble,” Djuric explained. The Noble Dollar will launch with a points campaign tied to a future Noble token, further bootstrapping adoption. But the launch of multiple stablecoins like Agora and M^0, which provide inherent yield, cements the idea that in the future, all stablecoin applications will start with a base yield. Whether this model will truly topple the non-yield bearing incumbents remains to be seen. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Scoop: Marc Andreessen, the billionaire co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, is helping interview and identify candidates for the Department for Government Efficiency despite having no formal role in the new advisory body https://t.co/SHToxXsDQt pic.twitter.com/kU5Ph5sJLn — Financial Times (@FT) December 5, 2024 Andreessen is leveraging his network to find qualified candidates for the initiative under the incoming Trump administration. Two people familiar with the talent search, despite Andreessen having no formal role at DOGE, revealed that Andreessen is actively recommending candidates from his network. The report indicated that Andreessen’s involvement in the recruitment process reflects his existing ties with Elon Musk. The DOGE advisory body has also publicly sought applicants through a post on its official X account, calling for “super high-IQ small-government people” willing to work on cost-cutting initiatives. Trump, Tech, and the Influence of Andreessen Andreessen’s influence on Trump’s policy decisions has also been noted. In a recent announcement, Trump criticized major tech companies, writing: “Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in the tech sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!” Amazing.

37261817,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317017,1733421326,The Sandbox and GALA Are Climbing Fast – Is This the Last Chance Before ATH?,"Is GameFi making a comeback? The Sandbox (SAND) and Gala Games (GALA) are flipping bullish, with SAND price up +56% week-on-week. In this article, jump into the latest GameFi price trends, and uncover whether there could be hotter opportunities in the meme coin market . The GameFi sector is thriving, with the combined market cap of all crypto gaming tokens climbing +6.2% to $33.1 billion. Meanwhile, 24-hour trading volumes across the sector have surged to $12.9 billion. SAND Price Analysis: The Sandbox Crypto Cements Reclaimed Historical Support Amid the hype for GameFi tokens, market-leading The Sandbox has been on the march, with a major push of +56% over the past week, leaving the token trading above historic support levels at $0.90. At press time, SAND is currently trading at a market price of $0.92 (representing a 24-hour change of -0.6%). This comes after a seismic candle Yesterday saw SAND price erupt +40% in a first major resistance test of the $1 mark, that ultimately topped out at $1.06. Ongoing price action reflects this high octane move, with price action Today in consolidation as SAND holders cement the freshly reclaimed historical support level. The move up has been powered by a bullish golden cross between the 20DMA and 200DMA, and the subsequent rally has been propelled by localized support from an ascendant 20DMA (now at $0.57). This close moving average support has provided the platform for the SAND price’s cup-handle breakout pattern over the last week, leaving SAND crypto in remarkably bullish form. Yet, further consolidation and potentially a retracement to the 20DMA likely dominate the week ahead for The Sandbox crypto, with the RSI over-heated by the recent move at 80. GALA Price Analysis: Gala Games Pushes Up Amid Sector Growth As the GameFi sector shifts into gear, Gala Games is pushing up, and it comes as no surprise as the project has leaped from strength to strength in recent months—from major Gala chain integrations to the release of Gala’s first movie, Today. Amid the ecosystem expansion, GALA is currently trading at a market price of $0.06 (representing a 24-hour change of -0.05%). The minor localized retracement comes after GALA price mounted a whopping 3 consecutive days of big green candles that ultimately saw price jump +64%, bringing GALA’s Month-on-Month gain to +245% (a better hodl than PEPE in this period!). Yet, with the RSI indicator now red hot at 83, it seems consolidation or retracement down to lower support at $0.05 could be on the cards. But fear not holders, as such a move is backed by the bedrock support of the ascending RSI (which is currently at $0.39), fresh off the bat of a ‘golden cross’ pattern on November 23. Uncover Wall Street Pepe: New Meme Coin WEPE Surges To Near $1M Raised in First 24-Hours The meme coin sector is ripe for a shake-up, and a freshly launched presale for up-and-coming token Wall Street Pepe is capturing the attention of smart money investors – as it surges toward $1M raised in its first 24 hours. Developers behind the project seem to be taking aim at the rising trend of insider whale groups, which dominate the meme coins you hear about most days – and prevent normal retail investors from capturing true moon-shot profits. WEPE promises to be different, enabling any investor of any size to participate in the pre-market launch of this rapidly growing project, with the rallying call “Wall Street Pepe hates that whales are hiding in insider groups. So he decided to make his own. Frogs strong together!”. The meme coin is centered around a multi-chapter story – something Book of Memes never truly capitalized on, and the message clearly strikes a chord with the market, as more than $830K has surged into this skyrocketing project, and it’s only day 1. But What Exactly is Wall Street Pepe? Why Is It Special?

37261240,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51454,1733421214,Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen’s Net Worth Surges by $6 Billion Since Election Day,"The recent surge in XRP’s value following Donald Trump’s November 5 presidential election victory has positioned it as one of the most significant winners in the crypto market. Since Election Day, the token’s price has increased by over 400%, reaching $2.86, its highest value since the cryptocurrency boom of 2017-2018. This rally has also driven Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen’s net worth to $9.2 billion, up from $3.3 billion, marking a substantial increase of 270%. XRP’s Market Performance and Criticism XRP’s current market valuation stands at $138 billion, reflecting growing investor optimism. However, skepticism about its utility persists. A Times Tabloid report earlier this year highlighted Forbes’ mention of XRP as a “Zombie Blockchain ,” noting that despite its market size, it has failed to achieve its intended purpose of replacing SWIFT in global interbank transfers. Legal Challenges and Regulatory Developments The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a focal point for the cryptocurrency’s future. In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit alleging that Ripple conducted a $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP tokens. While Ripple achieved a partial victory in July 2023 , Judge Analisa Torres ruled that retail sales of XRP through exchanges did not violate securities laws. However, institutional sales of XRP were deemed unlawful under U.S. securities regulations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The legal uncertainty surrounding XRP has been a significant hurdle, but recent political changes have renewed optimism. With Gary Gensler, who became a prominent adversary of the crypto industry during his tenure as SEC Chairman, set to resign in January 2025 , speculation about a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach under the Trump administration has grown. Investors are betting on XRP’s potential to benefit from a pro-crypto regulatory environment under the new administration. Many in the industry expect the incoming SEC chair to prioritize resolving XRP’s legal challenges, which could pave the way for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the token. Implications for XRP The resolution of the SEC case could remove a major obstacle for XRP, providing clarity and potentially unlocking additional institutional investment. A clean regulatory slate would likely boost XRP’s adoption and cement its position in the cryptocurrency market. Chris Larsen’s substantial financial gains underline XRP’s impressive performance and its evolving narrative in a shifting regulatory landscape. While challenges persist, the coming months may prove pivotal for XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The proposal is part of the “Jeju AI and Digital Transformation Roadmap.” Jeju remains a pro-cryptocurrency region after several years. Jeju, South Korea’s special self-governing province, has announced plans to implement digital payments for cross-border transactions. The province included the digital payments initiative in its “Jeju AI and Digital Transformation Roadmap.” According to a recent announcement, the roadmap aims to revolutionize Jeju into a cashless international city. Under the new plan, Jeju will enable digital asset-based cross-border payments with neighboring countries like China and Japan. The system will allow digital assets, including Bitcoin, to convert into Jeju’s regional currency for local use, streamlining transactions. It is important to note that the recent proposal is one of Jeju’s numerous pro-cryptocurrency activities, spanning many years.

37260542,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623397,1733420976,Pro-XRP lawyer marks 4 things the next SEC Chair must do for crypto,"In response to the announcement that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a new chair for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), pro-XRP advocate John Deaton shared his views on the appointment. Deaton emphasized specific action points that the new SEC Chair must prioritize on their first day in office to support the growth of the crypto industry. Yesterday, President Trump announced the nomination of Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, to succeed Gary Gensler as the next SEC Chair. The announcement, which was made through a post on Truth Social, came weeks after many reports identified Atkins as the most qualified candidate for the position. John Deaton has openly supported the digital asset industry and has made his stance publicly known. In light of this, he remarked that while most Senate candidates would typically avoid commenting on decisions made by the SEC, he is not a typical candidate and is willing to speak out. John Deaton asks Paul Atkins to change the SEC staff Initially, Deaton suggested that the subsequent SEC Chair address the Debt Box issue and terminate all parties involved in the affair. The SEC’s litigation against Digital Licensing Inc., also known as DEBT Box, a crypto-related firm, is the focal point of this incident. The SEC’s counsel acknowledged that the court deceived the company to obtain a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). As a result, the judge dismissed the litigation following the SEC’s request and directed the commission to reimburse DEBT Box $1.8 million in legal fees. Despite the fact that a number of SEC lawyers resigned in the wake of the DEBT Box scandal, Attorney Deaton is urging the incoming SEC Chair to terminate the employment of all individuals involved. In addition, Deaton demanded that Atkins fire or demote any SEC employees promoted to significant leadership positions by Gensler, whom he described as a bad-faith regulator. According to Deaton, the future SEC Chair should carefully select team members who share Trump’s ambition of making America the ‟Crypto Capital of the World.” He also encouraged the newly appointed SEC Chair to dissolve the agency’s digital asset Unit, which focuses mostly on cryptocurrency. Deaton believes there is no need for a dedicated digital asset unit at the SEC. Instead, he suggested that the new chairman create a generic fraud unit at the commission to combat fraudulent activity in various areas, including cryptocurrency and the stock market. The pro-XRP advocate advised that Atkins clarify that self-custody and decentralized finance (DeFi) are not subject to SEC regulation. This clarification would represent a substantial departure from Gensler’s previous stance, which has seen him label practically anything related to crypto as securities. It is worth noting that one of Trump’s campaign promises is to defend the right to self-custody. This revision would help crypto entities like Ripple XRP in their lawsuit. Crypto responds to Paul Atkin’s nomination Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, December 5, as traders applauded Donald Trump’s choice to appoint a crypto enthusiast to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission, strengthening hopes that the incoming president will push through efforts to de-regulate the industry. The apex crypto shot past the mark to a high of $103,800, following a bull rally since Donald Trump’s November 5 election, when he promised on the campaign trail to make the United States the “bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world.” With Bitcoin’s market cap exceeding $2 trillion, how might this leadership change shift the regulatory landscape and impact the broader crypto market?

42417046,ff18871b-92a5-4786-9686-de07259b4214,1733420677,Bitcoin at $100K: The Financial World Reacts,"There were many crypto firsts in 2024: the first spot bitcoin ETF, the first spot ether ETF, the first time a pension fund invested in the asset class.  But as the expression goes, they saved the best for last: In the waning days of the year, bitcoin (BTC) hit six digits for the first time.  The cryptocurrency surged past the $100,000 mark early Thursday UTC time, mushrooming from zero value into a $2 trillion asset in a little over a decade and a half.  It's a milestone that was difficult to imagine not long ago. Just two years ago, the entire cryptocurrency space was reeling from the cataclysmic implosions of FTX, Celsius and the Terra-Luna ecosystem. In the eyes of the general public, a toxic cloud hung over the whole industry. Bitcoin sank to around $15,000 and, to many mainstream observers, was wheezing in its final breaths.  Now, bitcoin has soared more than 500% from the desperate days of November 2022 when Sam Bankman-Fried's empire collapsed. A big difference between prior boom-bust cycles: Wall Street is firmly participating in this year's rally. The newly approved ETFs have lured institutions. Salesforces at mighty traditional financial giants like BlackRock are hawking crypto-related products. The soon-to-be U.S. president, Donald Trump, supports bitcoin and digital assets; he even has a DeFi project.  Whether it’s long-term believers, newly converted enthusiasts or even heads of state, many are taking victory laps — and longtime skeptics and permabears are coping.  Here's what prominent people are saying about BTC hitting $100,000:  Donald Trump, U.S. president-elect:  ""CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!!  Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy:  ""$100,000 Bitcoin. A milestone that represents more than price—it’s proof of adoption, belief, and a community that has carried this revolution from 0 to 100. With world leaders leaning in and a generational wealth shift underway, this is just the beginning.""  Peter Schiff, prominent gold and stock investor, and bitcoin skeptic: ""It's ironic that bitcoin only hit $100K by buying off politicians and getting in bed with government. Without expected government intervention, this milestone never would have been hit. What couldn't be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state.""  Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase: ""If you bought $100 of Bitcoin when Coinbase was founded in June 2012, it would now be worth about $1,500,000. If you kept the $100 USD you'd only be able to purchase about $73 worth of goods today. Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the last 12 years, and it's still early days.""  Anthony Pompliano, founder & CEO of Professional Capital Management:  ""What an epic milestone. … Bitcoin continued to be highly volatile, it went up a lot and it went down a lot too. There’s been multiple 30%, 50% or 90% drawdowns. That type of volatility would usually scare off many people. … It was one of the greatest selfless acts that I can think of.""  Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador  He posted a screenshot of El Salvador’s bitcoin portfolio, then the ""it ain’t much but it’s honest work"" meme after Elon Musk called it impressive.  Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group:  ""We believe the Fed Chair’s comparison of bitcoin to gold is a significant development as it introduces another level of credibility to bitcoin as a major asset in global markets. The fact that gold is still about 10 times larger than bitcoin should offer additional insight into how much more room there is for bitcoin to grow from current levels.""  Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares:  ""Bitcoin has made unbelievable strides this year. Amid the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs, election of a pro-crypto administration — and specifically Trump’s recent appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chair — proposals for crypto-friendly legislation, and accelerated growth in the crypto ecosystem, BTC has more than doubled — all in a span of 10 months. This momentum has pushed bitcoin past $100K. This milestone is likely to attract a new wave of investors, as many who had been sitting on the sidelines watching bitcoin's ascent are now reengaging with digital assets, spurred by this historic breakthrough.""  James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk:  ""2024 has been an inflection point for bitcoin. We have witnessed the most successful ETF launch of all time. MicroStrategy issued the largest at-the-market offering in history of $21 billion. We are seeing more publicly traded companies issuing convertible notes in order to buy bitcoin. When bitcoin first broke $10,000, I thought the financial capital markets would change forever. I was slightly too early on my call. But $100,000 most definitely does.""  Financial Times AlphaVille:  ""Nevertheless, with bitcoin’s price recently crossing $100,000, a significant number of commenters seem to feel they deserve an apology in light of our longstanding cynicism, so here it is: We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up. It’s nice when your number goes up. And we’re sorry if you misunderstood our crypto cynicism to be a declaration of support for tradfi, because we hate that too.""  Allen Farrington, author/venture capitalist:  ""In purely psychological terms, there is now no rational price between this and gold parity.""  Preston Byrne, managing partner, Byrne & Storm:  ""Price is an indicator, not an objective. This has always been the case and whilst adding another digit to the price is psychologically and symbolically significant, it is no more relevant to my day-to-day than 90k, 70k, or 50k before it. A rising price tells me [that] the wider markets are starting to also believe in longtime crypto believers' thesis in a fairly significant way. ... The expected end of the U.S. war on crypto business in the new year has driven a wave of optimism among current industry participants and new entrants. Regulatory normalization of crypto products in the world's largest economy was always a necessary prerequisite for widespread global adoption, and now it looks like we're going to get it.""  Des Dickerson, CEO of Thundr Games:  ""Bitcoin hitting $100K is a milestone that represents more than just a price point — it’s a testament to its growing adoption and resilience. It underscores the incredible potential of Bitcoin as the foundation for a new era of global, seamless digital payments. It's a signal to the world that we're building on solid, transformative technology that's here to stay. It's a perfect storm of hopium and recognition of Bitcoin's value prop as the most secure, decentralized, and globally accessible digital asset. How far will the price go next year? It's Bitcoin, so we should expect some bumps along the way. I am setting my sights on $200k, on our way to $1M!""  Andy Baehr, managing director, CoinDesk Indices: ""It was a champagne moment, served at a champagne hour. At 9:33pm and 41 seconds, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index read 100,000. By 10:08:42, the current ATH of 103,633.70 was hit. Among blockchain assets, bitcoin stands to gain the least from improvements to regulatory pavement. It has futures, ETFs, and options. It is available widely in the United States and around the world. Bitcoin's adoption momentum, bolstered by a thoughtful mention by Fed Chair Powell and a news cycle rich with positive sentiment, helps more investors feel like they've waited long enough; it's time to get involved. Optimism about better, more dedicated regulatory agencies and support have been a boon for ""future-of-finance"" blockchain assets.  ""The CoinDesk 20 Index has doubled since the day before Election Day, outpacing bitcoin. In fact, 10 of the 20 constituents in CoinDesk 20 have doubled (or better) this year. What lies ahead? Bitcoin becomes a staple, and its narrative will get detached from other blockchain assets, as improvements to everyday activities, financial and otherwise, proliferate. Ethereum's status as a clearinghouse for the most important on-chain activity will take better shape. CoinDesk 20 names, current and future, will take advantage of improved support and regulatory clarity.""  Nolan Bauerle, host of the ""American Bitcoin Citadels"" podcast:  ""A movement that started with a few people inspired enough or pissed off enough to give up their free weekends and evenings has taken over earth in a few short years. Bitcoin continues to be the most interesting story on the planet, and now it’s headed for the moon.""

This forecast aligns with MicroStrategy’s ongoing strategy of intensifying its Bitcoin acquisition program, which has significantly influenced the company’s stock performance, linking it closely to Bitcoin’s price movements. Saylor Envisions Bitcoin Price Soaring To $13 Million Bitcoin has already reached a valuation of approximately $2 trillion, with its price hitting a new record of $104,000 on Thursday. However, Saylor anticipates an additional $200 trillion will be added to Bitcoin’s market cap by 2045, driven largely by global inflationary pressures. According to Saylor, many investors are moving away from traditional assets in favor of Bitcoin, viewing it as a viable global monetary asset. He asserts that as more capital flows into Bitcoin, its growth trajectory will outpace equities, gold, and real estate. Related Reading: XRP Downtrend Is Only Temporary: Analyst Gives Reasons Why Price Is Headed For $3.2 Delving into specific price predictions, Saylor posited that bitcoin could reach an astounding $13 million per coin. This would represent a 12,384% growth if Saylor’s predicted scenario comes to fruition, potentially making it the largest currency in the world. Saylor bases this estimate on an analysis suggesting that Bitcoin has historically grown at an average annual rate of 29%. This growth, he argues, could continue, leading to the projected valuation by 2045. NewsBTC previously reported that Saylor believes that Bitcoin represents only 0.1% of the global capital market, but he envisions that figure increasing to 7%. Saylor also provided a detailed analysis of Bitcoin’s growth trajectory, outlining a four-year projection with an average growth rate that might start at 44% and gradually taper down to 30%. Contrary to the perception of Bitcoin as a high-risk asset, Saylor emphasizes its potential as a safe haven for risk-averse investors, highlighting the increasing demand for security in investment choices. MicroStrategy Ramps Up BTC Acquisitions In a recent social media update, Saylor shared the company’s performance following three years of strategic Bitcoin investments. He announced that year-to-date, MicroStrategy’s treasury operations have delivered an impressive BTC yield of 63.3%, resulting in a net benefit of approximately 119,800 BTC for shareholders. At prices of $103,000 per BTC, this translates to an estimated $12.3 billion in returns for the year, positioning MicroStrategy as one of the most profitable and fastest-growing companies operating under the “Bitcoin Standard.” Related Reading: Don’t Fade Dogecoin! – Analyst Says DOGE Is About To Rally On Monday, MicroStrategy revealed that it has significantly ramped up its BTC acquisitions, surpassing the milestone of 400,000 BTC in its portfolio. The company sold 3.7 million shares of its stock, generating around $1.5 billion in proceeds immediately reinvested into Bitcoin. This marks the fourth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases by the firm. Since November 11, MicroStrategy has invested over $13.5 billion in Bitcoin across three separate transactions, bringing its total holdings to approximately $38 billion, or 402,100 BTC, at an average purchase price of $56,658 per coin. BTC trades at $101,628 at the time of writing, recording a 6% surge in the 24-hour time frame.

37260765,https://invezz.com/?p=2371094,1733420471,Thiel-backed startup launches N1 blockchain to power next-gen crypto apps,"Layer N, a blockchain project supported by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, has unveiled its transformation into N1, a full-stack Layer-1 blockchain designed to enable advanced decentralized applications (dApps). Announced in New York on December 5, 2024, N1 introduces a groundbreaking platform capable of supporting highly complex crypto applications with transaction speeds exceeding 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). N1 aims to redefine the blockchain landscape by focusing on scalability, multi-language development support, and application-centric features. The project is designed to make blockchain accessible for developers and to enable applications that were previously too computationally demanding for other networks. Developer-friendly tools to boost adoption A standout feature of N1 is its support for Typescript app development, with plans to incorporate other programming languages such as Solidity, Rust, and C. This multi-language compatibility significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers transitioning to blockchain technology. N1 also offers native tools tailored to streamline app deployment and management: Hub Wallet: Simplifies cross-application asset management. Wallet Widget: Provides a unified login experience across multiple dApps. Vercel-like Deployment Interface: Allows developers to launch and manage apps with just two clicks. These features aim to attract developers by delivering the same ease of use seen in traditional software deployment, making blockchain integration seamless. Innovative dApps coming to N1 N1 is collaborating with several teams to launch apps that leverage its computational capabilities: Susa: A perpetuals decentralized exchange (DEX) developed by Sushi, featuring Kubo, a novel AMM protocol. Amber Group’s Perpetual DEX: Offers innovative asset listings and deep liquidity. Mindshare: A social finance (SocialFi) app enabling users to trade crypto narratives. Onchain AI Simulation: A Westworld-inspired project designed for real-time AI-driven world-building. These applications are distinguished by their computational complexity, which makes them impractical on existing blockchains. N1’s architecture provides the infrastructure necessary to power such next-generation apps. High-performance infrastructure Originally developed as a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum, N1 has evolved into a full-stack Layer-1 blockchain after Ethereum’s settlement layer proved to be a bottleneck for scaling. By replacing Ethereum with its own infrastructure, N1 can deliver transaction speeds up to 10-100 times faster than current blockchains. N1’s high-performance execution layer retains its L2 origins, having achieved 100,000 TPS on testnets. This scalability opens the door for dApps with unprecedented speed and efficiency, addressing a critical limitation of earlier blockchain platforms. Significant backing and proven expertise The N1 team has secured investments from high-profile backers, including Founders Fund, Multicoin, dao5, Kraken, Amber, GSR, and SALT. Prior to launching N1, the team developed a high-performance orderbook on Solana that processed over $500 million in trading volume, showcasing their technical capabilities and expertise. N1’s transformation into a Layer-1 blockchain signals a new chapter for blockchain technology, offering unparalleled computational power and a developer-friendly ecosystem. By enabling applications that were once deemed too complex, N1 is poised to drive innovation and expand the horizons of decentralized technology.

37274425,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107306,1733420397,Bitcoin Surpasses $100K Amid Institutional Demand and U.S. Buying Pressure,"Bitcoin has officially crossed the $100,000 milestone , marking a historic moment for the cryptocurrency market. According to CryptoQuant, an on-chain data analysis platform, institutional demand and sustained U.S. buying pressure are driving this remarkable rally. The Coinbase Premium Index—a key indicator reflecting the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance—stands at 0.16 , underscoring strong interest from U.S.-based investors. Key Drivers Behind Bitcoin’s Surge Several factors have contributed to Bitcoin’s rise above $100,000, cementing its status as a dominant global asset: 1. Institutional Demand CryptoQuant highlighted the growing role of institutional investors in this rally. Hedge funds, corporations, and other large players are allocating significant capital to Bitcoin, signaling confidence in its long-term value. Institutional Adoption : Companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale continue to expand their Bitcoin holdings through ETFs and direct acquisitions. Store of Value Appeal : As traditional assets face inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature attract institutional buyers. 2. U.S. Buying Pressure The Coinbase Premium Index measures Bitcoin’s price premium on Coinbase compared to Binance. The current index of 0.16 highlights sustained buying pressure from U.S. investors. Why It Matters : A positive Coinbase Premium Index often indicates heightened demand from institutional and retail investors in the United States. Economic Context : The U.S. market remains a major driver for Bitcoin, with favorable regulatory developments and increasing adoption. The Role of Coinbase and Binance in Bitcoin’s Rally Coinbase’s Impact As a go-to platform for institutional investors, Coinbase plays a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s price movements. Its high liquidity and regulatory compliance make it an attractive choice for large-scale buyers. Binance’s Competitive Influence Binance, as the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, continues to attract global traders. The price comparison between Binance and Coinbase offers insights into regional buying behaviors, with Coinbase’s premium reflecting strong U.S. demand. How Institutional Demand Shapes Bitcoin’s Market Dynamics Enhanced Market Stability Institutional inflows contribute to market stability by providing consistent buying pressure, reducing the volatility often associated with retail-driven markets. Price Support The sheer volume of institutional purchases creates strong support levels, making significant price corrections less likely in the near term. Mainstream Credibility As more institutions adopt Bitcoin, its reputation as a legitimate investment asset continues to grow, attracting additional capital. Historical Context: Bitcoin’s Journey to $100K Bitcoin’s climb to $100,000 represents years of technological innovation, adoption, and market growth. Key milestones include: 2009: Bitcoin’s genesis block was mined, introducing the world to decentralized digital currency. 2017: Bitcoin reached $20,000 for the first time, driven by retail FOMO. 2021: Institutional adoption pushed Bitcoin to $69,000 during a bull market. 2024: Surpassing $100,000 solidifies Bitcoin’s role as a global financial asset. Implications of Bitcoin’s $100K Milestone 1. Increased Adoption Bitcoin’s new ATH will likely attract more retail and institutional investors, further integrating it into mainstream financial markets. 2. Regulatory Focus As Bitcoin’s market cap grows, so does regulatory scrutiny. Governments worldwide are expected to increase oversight, particularly in the U.S. 3. Market Volatility While the current trend is bullish, investors should remain cautious of potential corrections, especially as large holders (whales) may take profits. What Is the Coinbase Premium Index? The Coinbase Premium Index is a vital metric for understanding regional demand for Bitcoin. It represents the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase, a U.S.-centric exchange, and Binance, a global platform. Positive Premium : Indicates higher demand from U.S. investors. Current Value (0.16) : Reflects strong buying pressure, particularly from institutional investors in the U.S. This metric often serves as a leading indicator of price trends, as U.S. buying activity can drive global sentiment. What Does This Mean for Investors? Opportunities Long-Term Growth : Bitcoin’s entry into six-figure territory highlights its potential as a long-term investment. Institutional Endorsement : The continued interest from large players reinforces Bitcoin’s credibility and growth prospects. Risks Market Corrections : Significant price increases often lead to short-term pullbacks. Regulatory Changes : New regulations could impact market sentiment or introduce compliance challenges for investors. Expert Insights on Bitcoin’s Future CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju Ju recently emphasized Bitcoin’s robust market fundamentals, urging investors to hold their positions as institutional demand shows no signs of slowing. Other Analysts Market analysts predict Bitcoin could reach $120,000 to $150,000 within the next few months, driven by the current momentum and institutional buying patterns. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $100,000 marks a historic moment in its evolution as a global asset. Fueled by institutional demand and sustained U.S. buying pressure, the cryptocurrency has entered uncharted territory, with the Coinbase Premium Index serving as a key indicator of ongoing strength. As Bitcoin navigates this new phase, investors are encouraged to remain informed and consider both the opportunities and risks associated with this transformative milestone.

37260049,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=657721,1733419849,Don’t Fade Dogecoin! – Analyst Says DOGE Is About To Rally,"Dogecoin is on the verge of breaking out from a 23-day consolidation range, setting its sights on new local highs. The meme coin has held steady within this range, but market momentum suggests it could soon surge higher. Analyst Crow has shared an optimistic technical analysis and told his followers not to fade DOGE as it’s about to run. This statement highlights the growing anticipation around Dogecoin’s price action, fueled by the broader crypto market rally. Related Reading: $1.87B Bitcoin Withdrawals From Coinbase In 24H – What This Means To Price Bitcoin’s recent breakout to a new all-time high above the $100,000 mark has reinvigorated market sentiment, creating a bullish environment that could benefit altcoins like Dogecoin. As BTC leads the charge, DOGE appears poised to follow, with its next move likely determining whether it continues its upward trajectory or remains trapped in its current range. A successful rally could solidify DOGE’s position as a market leader in the altcoin space. However, failure to break resistance could lead to extended consolidation. For now, all eyes are on Dogecoin as it inches closer to a decisive move, potentially igniting fresh excitement in the market. Charts Suggests Dogecoin Is About To Run Again Dogecoin has been trading in a sideways range since November 12, with bulls struggling to regain the momentum that previously fueled its massive rally. This prolonged consolidation has left many investors questioning whether DOGE can reclaim its former glory. However, the broader market sentiment, driven by Bitcoin’s historic breakout above the $100,000 mark, offers a glimmer of hope. Positive price action across the crypto market suggests that Dogecoin may be gearing up for another significant move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Supported By All-Stablecoins Cash Inflow – Data Reveals Strong Correlation Historically, Dogecoin has demonstrated its ability to outperform during bullish market conditions. Its most recent rally saw an impressive 225% surge, capturing the attention of retail and institutional investors alike. With Bitcoin leading the charge, Dogecoin appears ready to follow suit. The meme coin’s resilience in maintaining its range and the improving sentiment across the market could set the stage for its next massive rally. Top analyst and investor The Crow has added to the excitement, sharing a technical analysis on X with a bold message: “Do not fade the father of all meme coins.” This statement highlights the growing optimism among seasoned traders who believe Dogecoin is positioned for a breakout. If DOGE can break out of its current range and reclaim momentum, it may continue its rally, setting new highs. However, failure to do so could result in extended consolidation or even a potential correction. The coming days will be critical as Dogecoin attempts to capitalize on the renewed market enthusiasm sparked by Bitcoin’s record-breaking performance. Can DOGE Reach $0.50 This Week? Dogecoin has been battling a stubborn 4-hour resistance at the $0.455 level, keeping the meme coin indecisive. Breaking above this resistance would position DOGE to retest the $0.48 local high, a critical level that could determine its next significant move. If bulls break above $0.48 and hold it as support, a massive breakout will likely follow, potentially propelling DOGE toward new highs. This scenario aligns with Dogecoin’s historical behavior during bullish market phases, where overcoming key resistance levels often leads to explosive rallies. The broader market’s strong momentum, led by Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000, provides an additional tailwind for DOGE’s bullish prospects. However, the risks of failure remain. If DOGE cannot break above $0.455 and $0.48, the price may remain stuck in its current consolidation phase. Extended sideways movement could test investor patience, and a potential correction could drive the price toward lower demand levels.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO.

The historic climb followed brief concerns earlier in the day when a large amount of Bitcoin was transferred to exchanges, sparking fears of an impending sell-off. But those concerns were short-lived as Bitcoin quickly surged past the six-figure mark. Market analysts suggest that Bitcoin’s price is unlikely to drop below $100,000 in the short term, citing strong buy demand. “The order book shows strong support at $100,000 with over 4,600 BTC in buy orders,” said BRN analyst Valentin Fournier. “On the sell side, there are around 3,400 BTC in buy orders below $110,000, suggesting weaker resistance compared to the hurdle that needs to be overcome to break above $100,000.” Related News: Are Dogecoin and Other Memecoins Here to Stay or Just a Fad?

Initially that is expected to be Uniswap - follow the project’s Twitter (X) to be notified of the correct links to Uniswap or DEX aggregators like DEXTools and DEXScreener - beware of fake tokens that are listed before the official listing. As with any crypto ICO, admins will not DM you first - beware of accounts imitating admins which send unsolicited DMs. Pepe Unchained Presale: SOLD OUT! 🐸The token launch and claim will begin at 2 PM UTC on Tuesday, 10th December.Thank you all for joining us on this journey—it’s going to be a wild ride! pic.twitter.com/O6aMOfaha8 — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 5, 2024 A top-tier centralized crypto exchange is also reportedly set to be revealed alongside the DEX listing. Whales Buy PEPU Just Before ICO Sells Out Pepe Unchained has appealed to whales from the very start of its ICO. Back in July, a whale purchased $500k worth of PEPU in a single transaction. Similarly, another whale stacked over $220k worth of the meme coin in 4 separate transactions, data from Etherscan reveals. $50k buys in a single transaction were almost daily occurrences for Pepe Unchained. In mid November, a deep-pocketed investor swapped over $150k worth of ETH for PEPU. Just a few minutes later, another whale purchased $120k worth of the meme coin. That could bode well for its performance on exchanges once listed next week. Pepe Unchained Goes Viral In Closing Days of Presale 2024 has seen an influx of new meme coins, especially with the hype about the upcoming ‘meme coin supercycle’. Donald Trump’s re-election, Elon Musk’s continued backing of memes and meme coins and the Fed’s rate cuts have resulted in extreme bull market euphoria. Experts are also projecting an influx of retail investors as the Bitcoin price has now hit $100k and Dogecoin has also rallied close to its former ATH. With such a backdrop, even run-of-the-mill meme coins can deliver outsized returns. However, Pepe Unchained isn’t an ordinary meme coin. PEPU is a high-utility meme coin with many in-demand features. For instance, holders will soon be able to enjoy extremely low trading costs and instant transactions, features missing in most new Ethereum coins, thanks to Pepe Unchained’s Layer-2 chain.

37259785,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623201,1733418825,Solana co-founder advises crypto startups to move to the US,"Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has advised crypto startups to relocate to the US now that the country is set to have more regulatory clarity. In a post on X, Yakovenko noted that the upside of moving to the US is limitless for these startups. Although the crypto executive admitted that operating in the US comes with significant legal costs, he believes the US market has great potential, making it ideal for startups to thrive. He said : “You should prepare for moving your crypto startup to the US. The lawyers will still carve a pound of flesh out of your startup, but once the rules are clear the upside is unbounded. US is the largest unified free market economy in the world.” His comments reflect the current sentiments in the US about how the Donald Trump administration will be favorable to the crypto industry. These expectations have fueled a market rally that has seen Bitcoin surpass $100,000 for the first time, with many altcoins also soaring in value. However, some users believe that startups may not need to move to the US before they can attract users from within the country. Yakovenko did not fully agree with this opinion, noting that he believes regulatory clarity in the US could make it harder for offshore crypto companies to access the US market. Trump’s presidency is changing the US stance on crypto Meanwhile, several people agree with Yakovenko’s comments. Jeremy Allaire , the CEO of USDC stablecoin issuer, Circle, noted that that is why the company is relocating its global headquarters to the World Trade Center in New York City. This highlights how things have changed in the US in less than a month since Trump won the presidential election. Before then, the general sentiment among crypto stakeholders had been to leave the country for more favorable jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbeans. While some, such as Bittrex and Nexo, left the country completely, more notable US-based companies, such as Ripple, Gemini, Coinbase, Circle, and Kraken, all made efforts to expand abroad in 2023 and discussed their plans to leave due to the regulatory regime in the country. However, all these companies now appear focused on strengthening their base in the US market while waiting for the expected regulatory clarity that will come with the Trump Administration. For instance, Ripple is currently finalizing plans to launch a USD-pegged stablecoin, while Circle is reportedly planning to go public. Trump’s appointments boost optimism about regulatory clarity Despite optimism in the crypto market, several jurisdictions still have clearer and more crypto-friendly regulations than the US. However, all signs suggest that the US could soon rival other jurisdictions like Singapore and UAE in crypto-friendliness while boasting more liquidity. So far, Trump has already appointed pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman to replace Gary Gensler. Atkins, who was a Republican commissioner between 2002 and 2008, has been known to support the crypto industry. He has advocated for regulatory clarity within the US to prevent firms from leaving the country, and his appointment appears to be one of the catalysts for Bitcoin’s surge above $100,000. Meanwhile, Trump also appointed Scott Bessent, who has a history of supporting crypto, to become the Treasury Secretary. The appointment of these two individuals with pro-crypto leanings to key positions in government, coupled with the strong presence of pro-crypto Congress members, has boosted the confidence of industry stakeholders in the Trump administration.

This comes on the heels of Grayscale’s interest in spot Solana ETFs and institutions citing reasons for Solana’s sustainability. New data from on-chain analytics firms show four whales moving assets off exchanges to other custodians, showing possible long-term holding plans. The first whale withdrew 18,500 SOL worth approximately $4.2 million from Binance. The second came a few hours later as a whale transferred 46,103 SOL worth $10.85 million to another custodian. Subsequently, another large holder moved 100,010 SOL worth $22.46 million from Binance. Finally, a few hours ago, a transfer of 20,897 SOL worth about $5 million was sent out of Binance. Overall, these four whales moved 185,510 SOL ($42.46 million) in the last 24 hours. This influenced many retail traders to pick up smaller assets in anticipation of price gains. Institutions Drive Solana’s Growth The rise of SOL this year has largely been driven by institutional investment. A glance at CoinShares Weekly Fund flows shows whales have leaned toward the asst compared to other altcoins. Solana has outpaced Ethereum this year despite the latter having more growth potential. Grayscale’s spot Solana ETF application also saw new upticks in the past day, with traders setting new price targets. A major reason for Solana’s activity surge is its growing meme coin ecosystem . Solana meme coins surged to a market cap above $19 billion as users rolled out new assets. The rising sentiments that followed Donald Trump’s win were another bull catalyst that spiked SOL’s price alongside other coins. Positive crypto regulations will attract global interest away from the current uncertain waters. Traders Set New Targets For SOL Solana’s price stands at $239 after soaring above 270% since December 2023. Consistent bullish drivers place the asset in the green zone on multiple periods. Crypto trader @cryptojelleNL wrote on X (formerly Twitter) Manson an incredible bull case scenario for Solana at $600. While this figure remains high, bull drivers and positive macro can push the asset to new highs. “ $SOL broke its previous ATH, and now forms a falling wedge right on top of the 25-day EMA.

The total inflows on the days above were $353.6 million, $676 million, and $556.8 million, respectively. The data supports Ardoino’s explanation of how ETF products have supported USDT’s surge.

37259960,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51443,1733418046,Which Major Presale is the Best? BlockDAG vs Crypto All-Stars — A Deep Dive,"The crypto market is currently overwhelmed with presale events, yet the rivalry between Crypto All-Stars (STARS) and BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out due to its intensity. While the Crypto All-Stars presale attracts considerable interest with its meme coin charm, BlockDAG (BDAG) is progressing robustly, leading the field with its dynamic presale growth. BlockDAG has collected over $157 million in less than a year. The figures for BlockDAG’s presale are extraordinary, making it the focal point of the market. But does it hold more promise? Let’s examine the facts, technology, and community backing to decide. Crypto All-Stars Presale: Expectations vs Reality The Crypto All-Stars (STARS) presale has secured over $6.2 million, drawing participants with its MemeVault staking platform that supports a variety of popular meme tokens. This platform offers up to 316% APY in staking rewards, appealing to those seeking substantial yields from meme coin ventures. However, despite its initial success, Crypto All-Stars does not present a clear future vision, leaving many questioning the project’s direction post-presale. This uncertainty about its long-term viability and opaque future prospects could deter support as it progresses beyond the initial buzz. BlockDAG’s Unmatched Presale Growth BlockDAG has dramatically reshaped the crypto presale domain, amassing over $157 million in less than a year, now entering its 26th batch with 16.9 billion BDAG coins sold. The current price per coin stands at $0.0234, providing early supporters a remarkable 2,240% ROI. Such significant ROI and strong presale activity continue to generate excitement for BlockDAG each day. BlockDAG’s unique appeal lies in its modern Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, which ensures faster transactions, better scalability, and improved security over traditional blockchain models. Currently, BlockDAG is undergoing a Mainnet audit, an essential phase before launching its operational network. With each milestone achieved, BlockDAG is moving towards a target of $600 million. The momentum is undeniable, and the outlook for BlockDAG looks very promising as it gears up for its next significant development phase. Clarity and Strategy: Where BlockDAG Excels Over STARS A notable drawback of the Crypto All-Stars presale is its ambiguous long-term objectives. Despite its significant fundraising and the introduction of its staking platform, the project’s future remains unclear, leading to uncertainty about its direction. In stark contrast, BlockDAG has successfully achieved every milestone it has set, from launching its presale to rolling out the Testnet in September, and now progressing through the detailed audit of its Mainnet. BlockDAG’s methodical planning and reliable delivery have secured the trust of the community, offering a clear and sustainable vision for the future, whereas Crypto All-Stars has yet to prove its reliability over time. Issues with Openness May Affect Crypto All-Stars’ Credibility A significant issue facing Crypto All-Stars is the perceived lack of transparency, highlighted by user discussions on platforms like Reddit and various social media. The community has voiced concerns about the anonymity of its developers and the project’s openness, with reports of users being removed from the Telegram group for inquiring about the founders exacerbating the issue. Meanwhile, BlockDAG prioritizes transparency and a community-driven approach. It has revamped its website to enhance user experience and introduced a comprehensive 5-tier bonus system to great fanfare. The scheme rewards buyers with 150% bonus on their first BDAG purchase, growing to a 170% bonus on their second purchase and assured mystery gifts on their 3rd, 4th and 5th purchases. BlockDAG’s routine AMA sessions with its leadership, including the CEO, along with clear and regular updates, reassure users about the integrity and openness of the platform. This level of transparency distinguishes BlockDAG in a field often criticized for its lack of clarity. Assessing the Better Option: BlockDAG or Crypto All-Stars? While Crypto All-Stars has established itself within the meme coin arena, its questionable transparency and vague strategic direction have raised considerable concerns. Conversely, BlockDAG has showcased remarkable growth, amassing over $157 million in less than a year with a detailed roadmap and an approach centered around community engagement. With its cutting-edge DAG technology, BlockDAG promises enhanced scalability and speed, crucial for enduring success. As a leading entity poised to deliver significant returns, BlockDAG represents a compelling choice for those looking for a project with real potential, proven performance, and a commitment to transparency and user focus. This makes BlockDAG an ideal candidate for the next crypto presale opportunity.

Cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Solana are pioneering intriguing developments, turning heads not just in trading circles but in the tech world at large. But as crypto evolves, enter Lightchain AI —a blockchain ecosystem that’s merging blockchain with artificial intelligence to offer something entirely unprecedented. Today, we explore how these innovative cryptos and ecosystems are reshaping the blockchain landscape. Shiba Inu & Its Meme-Powered Ecosystem Shiba Inu is proof that memes are not just fun—they’re powerful. What began as a Dogecoin-inspired joke has evolved into a full-fledged ecosystem, including the development of *Shibarium**, a layer-2 blockchain. Shiba Inu’s appeal lies in its ability to engage a vibrant community while branching into utilities like decentralized exchanges, NFTs, and even play-to-earn games. Shibarium enhances scalability and reduces fees, making the ecosystem more efficient as it strives to carve out a space beyond its meme origins. That said, the fur-fueled fandom underscores how emerging cryptos can innovate on societal attention as their driving force. Solana: Blockchain Speed Redefined Solana, on the other hand, is the Usain Bolt of blockchains. With its high-performance architecture and proof-of-history consensus, Solana enables lightning-fast transactions while keeping costs minimal. Solana’s role within the debate on scalability cannot be downplayed—whether it’s introducing faster NFT minting or powering decentralized finance apps, it’s one of the few blockchain solutions actively mitigating the inherent bottlenecks of traditional platforms like Ethereum. But while Solana pushes the limits of blockchain speed, one of its critiques remains concerns about decentralization. Nonetheless, its work has driven innovation in the blockchain space, serving as a benchmark for how protocols can overcome technological challenges. Enter Lightchain AI—a Fusion of Blockchain and AI While Shiba Inu leverages community and Solana pursues efficiency, Lightchain AI takes blockchain innovation to an entirely different level by seamlessly merging blockchain with artificial intelligence. With features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI is more than just a blockchain; it’s a cutting-edge ecosystem set to transform how decentralized applications (dApps) and governance function. Here’s why Lightchain AI is worth keeping on your radar: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Revolutionizing Consensus Unlike Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), which validate transactions based on computational power or token holdings, Proof of Intelligence rewards nodes for contributing meaningful AI computations. Think training AI models, performing real-time inferences, and optimizing tasks. The significance? PoI creates an ecosystem that values intelligence-driven contributions while ensuring network security—all while consuming far less energy. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): A Game-Changer The AIVM brings true AI computing to blockchain. Imagine an AI capable of adapting and evolving, powering decentralized applications that resemble living, dynamic ecosystems. The AIVM enables developers to seamlessly execute AI-driven tasks on Lightchain AI’s platform, offering features like enhanced scalability, privacy, and flexible computation that traditional blockchains can’t match. Why Should Crypto Investors Care? Blockchain and AI are at the crux of global innovation. By combining these two disruptive forces, Lightchain is putting itself at the forefront of a trillion-dollar market opportunity. For investors, aligning with ecosystems like Lightchain AI means being part of the early stages of a tech transformation akin to the internet boom in the ‘90s. Shaping the Future of Blockchain Technology Cryptos like Shiba Inu and Solana are showing how blockchain can evolve beyond its initial use cases.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Runwago combines running with crypto rewards, offering a fresh approach in SportFi with massive growth potential. Table of Contents Discover Runwago and its record-breaking first presale round The first sustainable run-to-earn app designed for over 300M runners Perfect timing for a market breakthrough The second presale phase is just around the corner – December 5, 2024 Running is one of the most rewarding activities—nothing beats the feeling of hitting stride and pushing limits. But when it comes to running track apps, few stand out, and even fewer actually reward for the effort that one puts in. Wouldn’t it be amazing if there was an app that not only tracks progress but also pays for every step someone takes? Well, we discovered such an app. The world of SportFi is about to experience a major shift with the introduction of Runwago , a project that combines the thrill of running with the potential of cryptocurrency rewards. In a market dominated by big names like StepN and StepApp, Runwago is entering with a fresh approach, an already fully functional app, and massive growth potential. Here’s why Runwago is poised to become the go-to platform for both fitness enthusiasts and crypto investors alike. Discover Runwago and its record-breaking first presale round Runwago , a crypto project that came to life this year to change the way we think about run-to-earn platforms, has broken records from its very beginning, showing just how much excitement and interest it has sparked. The buzz surrounding Runwago is impossible to ignore, and it’s clear that people are paying attention to what it offers. Wondering why we say that? Well, it is because, during its first presale round, the project raised significant attention by selling out in just 9 minutes—$600,000 in just 9 minutes! This lightning-fast achievement highlights the confidence and enthusiasm of early investors who see the potential of Runwago to redefine the SportFi market. But what makes Runwago such a sought-after name in the industry? You might also like: Sovereign ‘gold rush’ for Bitcoin imminent: Expert The first sustainable run-to-earn app designed for over 300M runners Given the success of Runwago’s first presale round, it’s clear this is a project worth watching. And what makes it even more exciting is that it’s not just an idea on paper—they’ve come forward with something real and practical. At the heart of the project is the Runwago App, a fully developed product set to launch in Q1 2025. Unlike many crypto projects that make big promises but fail to deliver on time, Runwago has already built its app, proving its focus on usability and customer satisfaction. The Runwago App is developed for all types of runners. Whether someone is a beginner or an experienced athlete, they can choose a monthly challenge that fits their fitness level, deposit their preferred amount of tokens, and start running. Beginners can select easier challenges, while seasoned runners can tackle harder ones with higher potential rewards. Moreover, the app is designed to be simple and inclusive, removing common barriers to entry. Users don’t need to deal with NFTs or complicated setups to start earning crypto rewards—all they need is the motivation to run and their running shoes. This user-friendly approach appeals to over 300 million active runners worldwide, making it easy for people to turn their fitness routines into financial rewards. Runwago’s groundbreaking idea bridges the gap between two resounding industries: fitness and crypto. The platform offers a unique way for fitness lovers to earn tokens while staying healthy by rewarding users for hitting their running milestones. Starting with a modest market cap of $351,000, Runwago enters the scene as a hidden gem with enormous potential. For context, earlier leaders in the SportFi industry, such as StepN and StepApp, reached multi-billion-dollar valuations during the last bull run. Runwago’s strong start suggests it has the momentum to follow a similar path. Perfect timing for a market breakthrough Runwago is launching at just the right time, with the SportFi market ready for something new, giving it a great chance to make a real impact. The Token Generation Event (TGE) is coming in early 2025, and this is a unique opportunity for early supporters to get in and benefit from the project’s growth. A strong team is backing this promising project. Runwago is incubated by Moon5 Labs and developed by CleevioX, both respected names with solid track records in the web3 industry. This ensures that the project is backed by a professional team and supported by experienced companies with a reputation for success. With a solid product, a clear plan, and the right team behind it, Runwago is more than just another crypto project—it’s a serious contender that could outshine the leaders from the last bull run. Instead of just copying what others have done, Runwago is creating its own path. Its focus on making things easy for users and rewarding real-world activity sets it apart as a top player in the SportFi industry. Missed the first presale round? Don’t worry—there’s still plenty of time to join this exciting opportunity! The second presale phase is just around the corner – December 5, 2024 Runwago’s second presale phase, starting on December 5, 2024, is just around the corner. This is the chance to get involved in a project to change the SportFi industry. In this phase, each RWG token will be priced at $0.07, and after this, the listing price is expected to rise to $0.09. The presale will continue until the project raises the remaining amount to meet its goal of $1,580,000 (they’ve already raised $600,000 in the first round). Those who are interested in buying RWG tokens should head to the official website, connect their wallet, and make the purchase. They can use crypto like ETH , USDT , ARB, USDC, BNB , or even traditional payment methods like Mastercard or Visa. So, don’t miss out—mark the calendars for December 5, 2024, and be ready to take part in Runwago’s second presale phase.

37259426,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623350,1733417605,Economists and labor leaders voice fear over Elon Musk’s plan to cut workforce,"Concerns are mounting among US job recruiters, economists, and labor leaders regarding Elon Musk’s proposed workforce reductions. This is because it could limit the availability of quality positions amid a backdrop of decreasing private-sector employment. According to market analysts, this scenario could further worsen the already intense competition for white-collar roles. Elon Musk’s plan to reduce the federal workforce under Donald Trump threatens to destabilize one of the greatest engines of the US labor market. According to research, government and healthcare jobs have been the largest sources of employment in the past year, particularly for knowledge workers. The Tesla CEO, and his co-leader at the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E)” Vivek Ramaswamy, proposed that Donald Trump require government employees to work five days a week as part of a plan to reduce the size of the federal workforce. D.O.G.E causes fear for the US workforce In recent years, the federal government has been one of the largest employers of white-collar workers despite employing only 2% of the US workforce. The 3 million civilian employees of the organization are employed in a variety of roles, including medical providers, postal workers, and law enforcement officers at airports and prisons. Reducing the size of the federal government was a key campaign promise for the president-elect, and he has appointed Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to run the show. In addition, Elon and Ramaswamy stated that they intend to do “mass headcount reductions” to save more than $500 billion per year. Musk has already begun targeting climate-related employment, naming ordinary staff whom he intends to fire in posts on X. However, last month, the two promised to encourage voluntary departures by limiting remote work choices and offering early retirement bonuses. Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed, stated , “We’re getting closer to where we are not creating as many jobs as we need to keep up with the population. With fewer federal openings, “we start entering a territory where [the labor market] starts to get a little bit sketchier.” Lesley Mitler, a career coach who specializes in college students, said: “If people come to me and say they want to work in Washington, DC, I would say, ‘Why don’t we see how things evolve, before making that kind of commitment?” Is Elon Musk applying the same playbook at X to D.O.G.E? Elon Musk’s strategy for decreasing the federal workforce may bear similarities to the substantial staff reductions he implemented at X (formerly Twitter). Musk significantly reduced the company’s personnel following its acquisition of the social media platform for $44 billion in October 2022. He disclosed that he had eliminated more than 6,000 positions at X during an interview with the BBC. The company’s workforce has decreased from nearly 8,000 employees prior to Musk’s acquisition to approximately 1,500 employees. This is equivalent to a reduction of approximately 80% of X’s initial workforce. Under Trump, the federal government may adopt a strategy similar to the broader tech industry. It might entail reducing federal expenditures, eliminating bureaucratic layers, and enhancing overall productivity. The US labor force under Biden’s government According to the Congressional Budget Office, the US payroll costs taxpayers $271 billion per year. The government spends significantly more on contractors, at $750 billion, which union officials predict will climb following major layoffs. In October, the federal government created 2,100 employment opportunities, except for the Postal Service. The labor department reported that the total payrolls increased by only 12,000 workers that month. During the Biden administration, the popularity of government jobs has skyrocketed as workers, particularly younger ones, seek security following high-profile layoffs in the technology and finance sectors. Handshake, a US job portal aimed at college students and new grads, reported a 55% increase in applications for federal government jobs last year. Others want strong healthcare and retirement benefits, according to Andy Challenger of the outplacement company Challenger, Gray and Christmas. Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, stated that government employees are “scared” since employment vacancies in the United States have decreased by 11%, or 1 million, in the last year. However, Jacqueline Simon, the policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, stated that current government employees are preparing for a conflict.

The whales accumulated over 100 million ADA in the past 24 hours, coinciding with a period when the token attempted to stabilize around the $1.22 spot, according to data shared by cryptocurrency on-chain analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on December 5. ADA whale purchasing activity. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts Specifically, the purchase involved wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA. Historically, when these high-net-worth wallets accumulate an asset in large quantities, it has always acted as a precursor to further price growth. ADA’s path to $1.5 resistance Indeed, if the capital inflow is sustained, ADA will likely target the $1.50 resistance level, validating its recent price breakout after months of consolidation below $1. Regarding price movement, Martinez had observed in an earlier post that ADA is forming a classic ascending triangle pattern . Notably, this pattern is a bullish continuation signal, suggesting prices will likely break upward and continue a prior uptrend. The analysis noted that if ADA breaks the $1.23 resistance, the movement could open a path to $1.50. ADA price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts However, Martinez has previously issued warnings about a potential ADA crash. According to a Finbold report on December 2, the prominent analyst suggested that the digital currency could experience a sharp drop to $0.88, as the chart had formed a rising wedge pattern—a bearish reversal indicator. Overall, ADA’s price movements are tied to general market sentiment, which has turned bullish following speculation about Donald Trump’s re-election and the nomination of Paul Atkins as the next Securities and Exchange Commission chair. Meanwhile, several on-chain developments aimed at increasing Cardano’s use cases support this momentum. For instance, on December 4, Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra, recorded 2 billion transactions in just 4 hours, surpassing the daily transaction volume of global payment giants like Visa.

As of press time, it was trading at $1.20, with modest gains of less than 0.1%; on the weekly chart, it is up 21%. ADA seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold ADA’s market sentiment is positive, bolstered by the Fear & Greed Index reading of 84, which indicates ‘Extreme Greed.’ From a technical standpoint, ADA is trading well above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages ( SMA ) at $0.6149 and $0.4626, respectively, signaling a possible continuation of bullish momentum. However, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is at 78.52, suggesting the asset is overbought and may be approaching a potential correction. In conclusion, ADA is dominated by bullish sentiment, but the RSI reading and the extreme greed signal caution, as these momentum indicators point to a possible brewing correction.

Experts Give Their Opinion,"A panel of cryptocurrency experts discussed the evolving role of memecoins, agreeing that these popular cryptocurrencies are unlikely to disappear anytime soon, but disagreeing on whether use cases should play a role in their growth. Chris Newhouse, Research Director at Cumberland Labs, defended the potential use cases for memecoins, saying: “Being able to add utility to memecoins and monetize them, that’s an additional factor that you really can’t ignore.” He suggested that pairing humor with functionality could increase long-term viability. However, Genia Mikhalchenko, Business Development Lead at Douro Labs, offered a different perspective, saying that the fact that memecoins have a use case is “ultra bearish” for these tokens. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Decides to List 4 Altcoins on Futures When discussing potential competitors to established ecosystems, Dudas expressed optimism for Coinbase’s Base network but noted its current limitations. “Base doesn’t have enough tokens yet and needs to have a strong token ecosystem,” he said. Despite this, Dudas predicted that Base could eventually emerge as a rival chain in the memecoin space. The panel concluded that memecoins will continue to be a staple of the crypto market due to their unique combination of humor, culture, and speculation. *This is not investment advice.

These ETFs played a significant role in amplifying the stock's near-60% rise in November, the bank said.  November saw a record of almost $11 billion flow into U.S. spot bitcoin (BTC), spot ether (ETH) and leveraged MicroStrategy ETFs combined, the report said, with the leveraged MSTR ETFs accounting for $3.4 billion, or almost a third, of the total.  ""This highlights the rising impact of MicroStrategy's leveraged ETFs in crypto markets via facilitating MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchase program,"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  The company founded by Michael Saylor has spent $13 billion buying bitcoin this quarter alone, the report noted.  ""The growth in these ETFs is fuelled by increasing investor demand in obtaining amplified exposure to bitcoin through an ETF wrapper,"" the authors wrote, adding that this would not normally be available to retail investors.  MicroStrategy shares allow investors who are restricted from investing in spot bitcoin ETFs to obtain exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency, and due to the software company's inclusion in benchmarks such as the MSCI World index, the stock benefits from sizable passive flows.  The company's share price also reflects investor optimism about the potential profitability of MicroStrategy's corporate strategy, including its plans to become a bitcoin bank and develop BTC applications, and this adds a premium to the firm's valuation, the report added.  MicroStrategy currently meets the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index, according to Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer.

Known as the ""Ethereum killer,"" Solana’s recent price movements are causing a buzz in the crypto community, and for a good reason. With innovative technology, promising partnerships, and bullish sentiment brewing, SOL is positioning itself as a strong contender for December’s top-performing altcoin. The Catalyst Behind Solana's Momentum 🪄 The Solana ecosystem has been on fire lately with the announcement of major partnerships and integrations. One of the more compelling aspects of Solana is its high-speed performance. Thanks to its Proof of History (PoH) consensus, Solana processes transactions at lightning speed (we’re talking up to 65,000 TPS!). Combine that with lower fees compared to Ethereum and you've got a real winner for blockchain scalability. Additionally, Solana is gaining traction in Web3 projects, with new decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, NFTs, and gaming ventures choosing SOL as their go-to chain for development. Most notably, the optimism surrounding Solana's recent efforts to strengthen its ecosystem post-FTX fallout is making both retail investors and institutions take notice again. Analyst Insights on SOL From an analyst’s perspective, Solana's current charts are showing solid indicators of bullish behavior. Recent breakouts above resistance levels highlight growing demand for SOL amidst a wider market rally led by Bitcoin. Volumes are increasing too—indicative of new liquidity flowing into the ecosystem. If SOL maintains momentum, some analysts are predicting a potential test at $45, which would make it one of December's best performers. But, particularly in the crypto world, bull runs don’t come without skepticism. Volatility makes it all unpredictable at times and, hence, any correction downwards could lead investors rushing to secure profits instead of hodling for the big wave. What About the Long Game? 🔭 While December looks promising, Solana is not just a short-term play. Its unique architecture allows developers to build resource-intensive decentralized apps (dApps) without lag or performance bottlenecks. This robust infrastructure has sparked interest among major tech players and emerging blockchain projects alike, further solidifying SOL’s long-term potential. Speaking of innovation, one blockchain project that might interest those who believe in groundbreaking tech is Lightchain AI. While not directly related to Solana, Lightchain AI—a blockchain combined with artificial intelligence—showcases another layer of what Web3’s future could look like. Its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus model and AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) could turn heads in industries that depend on cutting-edge AI computing. Lightchain AI’s Growing Role in the Crypto Space 🚀 Since innovation drives the Web3 narrative, projects like Lightchain AI are worth exploring. Its mission to decentralize AI tasks, enhance scalability and create community-driven governance means it’s riding on similar innovation waves as Solana but with a unique angle. Plus, with the presale of Lightchain AI tokens ($LCAI) currently live at $0.003, it could be a potential moonshot for early investors keen on combining blockchain with AI tech. (But always DYOR—do your own research!) Final Thoughts on Solana and the Crypto Landscape 🌌 Back to Solana—the altcoin is proving why it remains a top player in the blockchain world even amid scrutinous market conditions. Both short-term traders and long-term believers have reason to keep SOL in focus for this December’s price action. If you're excited about innovation in crypto and its intersection with technologies like AI, projects like Lightchain AI are also worth keeping on your radar. One thing’s for sure—the crypto world isn’t slowing down as it hurtles toward uncharted digital terrains. Explore Lightchain AI and Stay Ahead in Innovation!

While examining the growing interest in meme coins, CoinPedia’s technical expert highlighted Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest crypto-meme coin, as being poised for notable upside momentum. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, SHIB has broken out of a tight consolidation zone near the horizontal level of $0.0000295. With this recent breakout, the path for upside momentum appears clear. Based on price action, there is a strong possibility that the meme coin could soar by 30%, reaching the $0.000041 mark in the coming days. Source: Trading View On the positive side, SHIB is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating an uptrend. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the overbought area, suggesting that SHIB still has enough room to soar in the coming days. RSI is a technical indicator that determines whether an asset is oversold or overbought, helping traders and investors make informed decisions about building positions. Bullish On-Chain Metrics With this bullish price action, it appears that whales and institutions have shown strong interest and confidence in the meme coin, as reported by on-chain metrics from Coinglass. $51.63 Million SHIB Outflow From Exchanges According to SHIB spot inflow/outflow data, exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $51.63 million worth of SHIB since the beginning of December 2024. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency context, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses, indicating that long-term holders have accumulated significant amounts of meme coins. This outflow suggests a perfect buying opportunity, hints at potential upside momentum, and further reduces selling pressure. 83% Top Traders Hold Long Position In addition to long-term holders, traders have also shown confidence in the meme coin. According to data, the SHIB long/short ratio on Binance currently stands at 5, indicating strong bullish sentiment among traders. Currently, 83.35% of top traders on Binance hold long positions, while 16.65% hold short positions.

Whales Accumulate in Jaw-Dropping Numbers,"The DOGE price has jumped by 9% in the past 24 hours, racing to $0.4502 on a day when Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high. Dogecoin is now up by 12% in a week and by 162% in a month, cementing its position as one of the best meme coins to buy right now. Today, DOGE’s volume has also risen substantially as whales resume accumulating the token, much as they did in the immediate aftermath of last month’s election. It looks on course to reach $0.50 by the end of the year, while the first part of 2025 could see it reach whole numbers for the first time in its history. $10 DOGE Price Boom? Whales Accumulate in Jaw-Dropping Numbers Dogecoin’s volume stands at $17.8 billion today, which for context is almost 3,000% higher than it was three months ago. It’s still not quite as high as it was in the immediate wake of the US election, when it rose beyond $44 billion. However, it does suggest that the token is gearing up for another run, with whales buying up DOGE in substantial numbers in recent days. 117,893,137 #DOGE (48,848,984 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallet https://t.co/uGqgOmPTUY : — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 2, 2024 This kind of accumulation is reflected in the token’s chart today, which recently formed a golden cross. As we can see below, DOGE’s 30-period average (orange) climbed over the 200-period (blue) overnight. This signals a break out, which Dogecoin (and many other major tokens) appears to have already begun. Source: TradingView Its RSI (purple) shot up to 70 earlier this morning, and after a dive is now rising back towards 60, suggesting that buying pressure remains strong. If it can break decisively through the $0.46 resistance level it would have a very strong chance of making it through to $0.50 by the end of December. Either way, its long-term picture continues to look very good, given that longtime Dogecoin fan Elon Musk has secured a seat for himself in the Trump administration.

New Presale Tokens Will Ride Bull Market to Big Gains Dogecoin is likely to do well over the coming year, but the developing bull market will also help numerous other alts enjoy big returns. Now seems to be a particularly good time for presale coins, which can often use their sales as launchpads to strong rallies when they list. Crypto All-Stars (STARS) looks like one particular presale coin with a great chance of doing well next year, having raised over $8.7 million in its sale . Can’t Stop! Won’t Stop! There’s a party at the All-Stars house and it’s not slowing down anytime soon! 8 Million is a massive milestone and with this kind of support Crypto All-Stars is sure to go down in meme coin history! pic.twitter.com/Mw11M6F1ys — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 3, 2024 Its sale has only 15 days left to run, with investors flocking to it because Crypto All-Stars is the first project in crypto to offer a ‘MemeVault’. The MemeVault is a smart contract-based protocol which enables holders of any meme token to stake their funds and earn a yield. By using the ERC-1155 multi-token standard, Crypto All-Stars’ contract is able to tokenize any cryptocurrency, even those which don’t run on Ethereum. This is bullish for STARS because users will receive higher staking rewards in proportion to the amount of STARS they hold. In other words, users can stake Dogecoin, for experience, and if they hold STARS coins as well they’ll receive greater rewards. This exposes STARS to lots of potential demand, so it could rally bullishly once it launches.

But how do you separate the next big thing from the noise? That’s where we step in. After a deep-dive analysis, we've identified three tokens that could deliver life-changing returns when the next bull run begins. Imagine turning $750 into $25,000 with the right picks—sounds crazy? Not if you know where to look. Buckle up for a nerdy-yet-analytical ride into these hidden gems. 1. Lightchain AI (LCAI) 🚀 The Future of AI & Blockchain If merging blockchain with artificial intelligence sounds like a sci-fi dream, Lightchain AI is making it a reality. At its core are two groundbreaking innovations—Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM). This ecosystem rewards computational tasks like AI model training while ensuring energy efficiency and network security. Here’s what makes LCAI stand out: Revolutionary PoI Consensus: Instead of traditional Proof of Work or Staking, it actually rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations. AIVM: A cutting-edge layer enabling seamless execution of AI-specific tasks on the blockchain. It’s like deploying a literal smart contract on steroids. With the growing demand for AI and decentralized solutions, LCAI is positioned as the foundation for a future where intelligent networks dominate. Oh, and did we mention that their presale tokens are at a bargain price of just $0.003? Imagine the moonshot potential once the mainnet takes off. Learn more about Lightchain AI Read the Whitepaper 2. Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) 🌴 Keep It Cool, Keep It Profitable Next up is a token for those with a sense of humor but who also love hefty gains. CHILLGUY started as a memecoin but is now carving its niche as a lifestyle brand in the crypto world. Think Dogecoin, but with an extra chill factor coupled with real-world collaborations. Here’s why CHILLGUY could surprise you: Strong community vibes. Crypto is all about tribes, and CHILLGUY’s squad is laid-back but vigilant about ensuring project success. Exclusive perks. Members gain access to merchandise, NFT drops, and even chill-themed retreats. (Seriously, who doesn’t want that?) Rapid adoption. More and more small businesses in hospitality and leisure are accepting CHILLGUY because they vibe with its ethos. While other projects burn out under pressure, CHILLGUY embodies staying power—with serious upside potential during the next bull run. 3. BasedBrett (BRETT) 🎯 From Meme to Mission Introducing BRETT, a once-dismissed memecoin that’s now making waves as a symbol of resilience and utility in DeFi. Its transformation isn’t just hype—BRETT is evolving to include innovative lending protocols and staking options. What makes BRETT worth a second look? Community governance ensures holders vote on its roadmap, which creates incredible alignment between developers and investors. Their upcoming integration into a Layer-2 ecosystem means lower gas fees and faster transactions, making it a practical choice. Let's face it—BRETT’s meme origins add virality, but its pivot toward utility suggests it could quietly become a blue-chip contender. Imagine a scenario where the next bull market results in every Gen Z and Millennial investor talking about BRETT endlessly on their TikTok feeds. Early entry could spell massive rewards for now-silent believers. The Path to Potential 33x Returns All three tokens—Lightchain AI, Just a Chill Guy, and BasedBrett—have unique value propositions catering to different aspects of the crypto space. Whether it’s cutting-edge AI integrations, lifestyle branding, or DeFi innovation, these are the projects we believe could redefine portfolios in the near future. Now, here’s the kicker—imagine investing $250 into each of these tokens. With conservative calculations and historical trends, even moderate success could transform that $750 investment into over $25,000. Of course, like all investments, crypto carries risks, but knowing which projects to back can make all the difference. Don’t Just Watch—Be Part of the Innovation Are you ready to secure your spot in the next wave of blockchain and crypto innovation? Start by exploring Lightchain AI, the most disruptive AI-blockchain hybrid in the market today. Their ongoing presale offers early-bird pricing AND access to features like PoI, AIVM, and much more. 🌐 Website 📄 Whitepaper 🐦 Twitter/X 💬 Telegram Invest smartly and stay ahead of the curve—whether you're chillin' with CHILLGUY or making a bold play with BRETT, the crypto world is full of potential.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Shiba Inu, Bittensor, and DTX Exchange lead the bull market, with DTX gaining 500% and experts predicting huge returns. Investors have raked in millions recently in the bull market’s initial stage. Some investors have become multi-millionaires by investing in cryptos with great fundamentals and robust price momentum. Here, we will discuss the best three coins: Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bittensor (TAO), and DTX Exchange (DTX). These coins have performed very well in the recent upswing but still have the capacity for mega rallies. SHIB has benefitted from the memecoin mania while Bittensor (TAO) has broken out of the base. The prior focus of experts in DTX Exchange has increased 500% from the first stage, and crypto experts say that it is the multi-bagger coin that can generate multi-bagger returns for investors. Shiba Inu near breaks 8-months high prepares for upswing Shiba Inu has captured market attention with a strong breakout, solidifying its position above the crucial multi-month breakout of $0.000033. This surge highlights fresh momentum as SHIB overcomes key resistance levels, fueled by strong buying interest and rising trading volumes. Technical analysis shows that Shiba Inu has formed a rounding bottom pattern, a bullish reversal sign. On-chain data suggests a potential influx of 33.7 trillion SHIB, setting the stage for heightened volatility. This massive activity could significantly influence the Shiba Inu’s price and overall market dynamics. Meanwhile, transaction volumes and community engagement for Shiba Inu remain robust.

After its impressive rally, Bittensor (TAO) faced selling pressure around $675 and faced a drop to $600. Barry Silbert, DCG chief, and Yuma CEO, sees huge potential in Bittensor (TAO). He compares its impact to Bitcoin’s, calling it “the World Wide Web of AI.” BBittensor (TAO) is a decentralized AI network that rewards participants who contribute data and computing power. Price target for DTX Exchange In 2025 amid Mainnet launch Recently, DTX Exchange was listed in CoinMarketCap, exciting its huge user base. According to the CMC listing, the DTX Exchange could process the main listing in various exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance. In the presale stage, DTX Exchange has over 300k community members eagerly awaiting the listing of the DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange has surpassed the $9 million milestone in the last few weeks, transitioning from $0.1 to $0.12. DTX Exchange is the first hybrid exchange to provide multi-asset trading with 1,000x leverage and different rewards and incentives to acknowledge crypto genius’s dedication. This increased demand in the DTX Exchange indicates its robust price momentum after listing.

Top Altcoins to Buy in This Exciting Time,"History has been made since Bitcoin (BTC) broke through the long-awaited $100,000 level. While BTC leads the charge, the market revealed several profit-making altcoins to buy during these exciting times. Bitcoin (BTC): The Fearless Leader Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency world, has maintained its position as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC remains the go-to choice for institutional investors. With Bitcoin finally breaking through the $100,000 barrier, investors are glued to the charts to see what the market has in store next. Let’s explore the most exciting altcoin projects to buy in these historic times. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot (DOT) witnessed an exceptional surge, gaining over 180% in the past month and 34% over the past week. DOT, the 14th largest crypto by market cap, struggled to make gains over the past while trading as low as $3.69 early in November. Since Donald Trump’s victory in the US election, the DOT has slowly been gaining ground, having gained over 180% in the past month. DOT also reported an increase in daily trading volume, which currently trades for $10.86 . Despite its recent troubles, Polkadot’s (DOT) rally cements its position in crypto and proves why it should not be disregarded. DOT’s ATH is $55, meaning the potential profit to be made from this project is still enormous. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Floki Inu (FLOKI) initially came to market as a celebration of the meme culture but quickly rose through the ranks to become a serious investment opportunity. The project owes its success to a very active community and innovative marketing campaigns, allowing it to expand its utility. Floki Inu recently became a fully functional Web 3 service provider housing a range of Web 3 features. With its expansion, the Floki ecosystem now houses a range of Web 3 ventures, including TokenFi for NFT and asset tokenization, a P2E metaverse, a staking dApp, and a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) marketplace. FLOKI experienced a significant surge amid BTC's recent rally gaining over 88% in the past month. The popular memecoin is up by over 8% in the seven-day chart. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $18.5 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 230%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 12th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. SHIB gained over 73% over the month and appears ready to explode as Bitcoin skyrockets. Husky Inu (HINU) Hits Presale Target Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the highly coveted Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. The project has raised attention because of its ambition to compete with the best in the memecoin industry. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu (HINU) has exceeded its presale goals, smashing its $600,000 fundraising target. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu’s presale success sets the tone for immense gains and is expected to skyrocket following exchange listings. HINU presale tokens are available at a modest $0.00012500 with exceptional profit potential for early backers.

However, the buzzing 1Fuel is getting most of the attention. 1Fuel is on presale and it could reward investors with massive gains. Experts already predicted about 200x by 2025, suggesting that it is an excellent medium for Cardano whales to flip their profit, and make higher returns. 1Fuel Presale: Proactive investors eyes 200x Return 1Fuel looks capable of doing 200x or more in 2025. The new token is billed for a steady price increase throughout presale, and a huge surge after public launch looks possible. 1Fuel has what most of the other new tokens lack — innovative use cases with a team of dedicated developers. This will play a crucial role in its expected success. The token has already piqued crypto whalesinterest, and its adoption could skyrocket in the coming days. The expected increased adoption makes it important for potential adopters to act fast. 1Fuel is already halfway through its first presale stage, and the next stage will likely sell at a higher price. The 1Fuel presale is not a game that speculators can win, proactive investors will be the highest gainers in the long run. Investors are gradually getting their stakes from the token's 500 million presale supply, and many onlookers may be left with nothing when 1Fuel's prospect becomes clearer. 1Fuel’s promises of simplified transactions, better security, privacy, and user-centricity will make it popular amongst crypto users. The crypto wallet will cater to every need including offline and online asset storage, seamless cross-chain transactions, peer-to-peer exchange, privacy concerns, automation, and trading assistance. This will make 1Fuel the ultimate wallet for storing assets and transacting. Furthermore, 1Fuel developers have ensured there's something for everyone in the ecosystem. This could prove vital to the project's longevity and sustained relevance. Community members will have airdrop rewards, token holders can stake for passive income, while active traders will also have their allocated rewards. 1Fuel looks prepared to dominate the market. Join the presale now, and be a part of its journey before it hits the exchanges. Cardano price outlook: What to expect in 2025 After months of price stagnancy, Cardano seems to have found its momentum. The altcoin has impressed in the past month and analysts believe it can repeat the good momentum in 2025. Their loyal investors have been rewarded with a pump of over 250% in the past month, and new entrants can gain even more if they can beat ongoing bear pressure. At press time, ADA is finding support around $1.16, after failing to beat the resistance at $1.30. The altcoin will be hoping to test the $2.00 price zone in Q1 2025, if it can successfully rally beyond $1.50 in the coming weeks. Many factors could work in Cardano’s favor to see it achieve this in the coming months. The developers are working tirelessly to improve the ecosystem, while the anticipated bull market could spur another impressive rally. Experts prediction is that ADA would set a new all-time high before Q3 2025. It remains to be seen whether the altcoin can live up to the $5 projection set for it in 2025. Conclusion Long-term Cardano investors are in profit but the current outlook suggests it may only last a while. Hence, attention is massively turning to 1Fuel, as investors look to consolidate their Cardano gains. Unlike Cardano, 1Fuel has maintained its bullish momentum since its presale started. The new token looks promising and may have a better yield than Cardano in 2025. 1Fuel has attracted interest from crypto whales, and competition to join its presale will become fiercer in the coming days. Be among the early adopters now, to avoid stiff competition. Learn more about 1FUEL.

This clarification comes amid rising speculation over the potential expansion of institutional participation in the nation’s crypto market. In an official statement , the FSC dismissed the rumors, asserting , “The issue of corporate real-name accounts for virtual assets is set to undergo further discussion, and specific measures have not yet been finalized. Therefore, please exercise caution in reporting.” The FSC’s response follows an article published by Korea Economic Daily , which claimed that the commission had devised a phased plan to permit corporate crypto trading accounts. According to the report, the alleged roadmap proposed a gradual rollout, beginning with universities and local governments in 2025 and eventually extending to corporations and financial institutions. Current restrictions on corporate crypto accounts Under South Korea’s existing regulations, corporations face considerable hurdles in engaging with the crypto market. A “de facto” ban prohibits them from trading on exchanges that offer fiat-to-crypto services, effectively sidelining corporate participation. To transact in crypto, South Korean investors, primarily retail must use real-name accounts at banks partnered with licensed exchanges. Source: X However, these banks generally prohibit corporations from opening such accounts, citing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) guidelines. Only five exchanges in South Korea have established partnerships with banks to facilitate this process. The FSC’s cautious approach reflects broader challenges in regulating South Korea’s crypto market. While the Virtual Assets Protection Act, implemented in July, introduced measures to enhance risk management and accountability for exchanges, gaps remain in addressing corporate participation and infrastructure development. Institutional participation under review Despite denying the existence of a finalized roadmap, the FSC has acknowledged ongoing discussions regarding institutional access to the crypto market. On November 6, the FSC’s recently established crypto committee held its inaugural meeting to examine the possibility of easing restrictions on institutional crypto participation. Industry insiders have noted that institutional involvement could diversify the market’s participant base and align South Korea with international trends in cryptocurrency adoption. South Korea’s crypto market has consistently demonstrated its scale and impact. This week, during a brief political crisis, President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, an order quickly overturned by the National Assembly. The nation saw a staggering $35 billion in 24-hour crypto trading volume. Before the martial law order announcement, retail crypto trading volumes in South Korea had surged to $18 billion, surpassing the nation’s stock market by 22%. According to a December 2 report from 10x Research, these trading levels marked the second-highest of 2024, driven by heightened activity in “high momentum” altcoins. Debate over corporate crypto accounts The topic of corporate crypto accounts has sparked a heated debate among regulators, financial institutions, and market participants. Supporters argue that granting corporations access to crypto accounts could enhance market transparency, foster innovation, and attract institutional capital. Institutions like Seoul National University have expressed interest in monetizing donated cryptocurrencies. The university reportedly holds nearly 100 billion won, which is approximately $75 million, in crypto assets donated by game company WeMade in 2022. However, regulatory barriers have prevented these funds from being converted into usable capital. Critics, on the other hand, caution against potential risks, including money laundering, market volatility, and capital flight. Some analysts have voiced concerns that allowing corporate crypto accounts could exacerbate financial instability, particularly amid fluctuating domestic stock markets.

Avalanche is just one of several crypto projects that have started negotiations, with spectators anticipating a huge bull run due to Trump’s pro-crypto stance. As the crypto market continues to build momentum, a popular new altcoin that recently went viral with Bitcoin on X, is showing potential with a massive 106.67% ROI during this presale. This disruptive new project, Cutoshi , is set to empower investors with its DeFi ecosystem, which will include a decentralized exchange, an academy and passive income opportunities. Avalanche Begins Trump Negotiations During a recent announcement Emin Gün Sirer highlighted that Avalanche is looking to achieve tangible results as part of its Trump negotiations rather than showcasing political connections. Sirer highlighted that in true Avalanche style, “You won’t see our political connections on social media. You will see results suddenly.” Since the announcement, Avalanche’s price has increased by 6.2%, taking AVAX to $50.94 at the time of writing. Avalanche’s daily trading volume has also soared by 70% to $2.8 billion. This significant rise suggests that investors are bullish about Avalanche’s future growth. In addition to this announcement, Avalanche recently launched its Avalanche9000 network upgrade. This upgrade is the biggest since the protocol launched and is designed to simplify launching a Layer-1 network on Avalanche. Data from a recent Messari report shows that Avalanche’s total value locked (TVL) increased by 66% in Q3 to $1.5 billion. Daily transactions have also increased by 18%, suggesting that the ecosystem is growing significantly. Cutoshi Hits New Highs As Stage 3 Sells Out While Avalanche begins talks with the Trump administration, Cutoshi has soared as the altcoin market builds up momentum. This lucrative new project combines meme coin with altcoin utility to offer an ecosystem that truly empowers its user base. Built on the theme of the Chinese Lucky Cat, Cutoshi looks to bring investors good fortune and wealth. It embodies the values of decentralization, privacy and monetary freedom that Satoshi Nakamoto wanted when first creating Bitcoin. This starts with the Cutoshi exchange. Fully decentralized, the exchange prioritises low fees over company profit. Cross-chain transactions can be made instantly with fees of just 0.25%. 80% of these fees are given to liquidity providers and the remaining 20% is used to buy $CUTO tokens from the market. These tokens are then permanently burned to increase scarcity and put $CUTO on a deflationary path. To complement its exchange Cutoshi is also launching an educational platform for DeFi investors. Known as the Cutoshi Academy, the platform will help new investors build a strong foundation to invest profitably while helping experienced investors to elevate their skills and optimize their portfolios. This is expected to support cryptocurrency adoption by easing new investors into the DeFi ecosystem. Cutoshi has already rallied by 106.67% during the first three stages of its presale, during which it’s raised over $1.27 million. Currently, investors can take advantage of a $2,000 prize pool by posting memes on Cutoshi’s social media accounts. The top memes will be granted a share of the prize on December 4. Investors can also support the Cutoshi presale and earn rewards as part of Cutoshi’s farming program. By completing challenges, investors can earn CUTO points, which can be redeemed for tokens once the presale is complete. $CUTO is currently available for just $0.031, with 10% of the stage four presale supply selling in just 24 hours!

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS.

This means BTC has outperformed the cryptocurrency market as a whole today, with average prices up by a more modest 2%. The original cryptocurrency is now up by 8% in a week and 49% in a month, with its momentum likely to take it even higher by the end of the year. Some analysts are now even offering Bitcoin price predictions of $150,000 by the end of the year, and given the month or so the coin has had, no one can confidently rule out such a possibility. Bitcoin Hits $100K Milestone – Will $150K Come Sooner Than Expected? BTC topped out at $103,679 very early this morning, with this price now serving as its all-time high. Despite a very slight retreat, its momentum remains very high, with its relative strength index (purple) holding to the 70 level after reaching 80 earlier today. Source: TradingView Its 30-period average (orange) also looks very bullish, in that it has very recently formed a golden cross with the 200-period (blue). This indicates an incoming breakout, which Bitcoin has clearly achieved in the past 12 hours. And with its trading volume at a very high $164 billion, it’s apparent that demand for the cryptocurrency is going through the roof right now.

37258524,https://crypto.news/?p=14316520,1733415271,How Lightchain AI combines AI solutions with blockchain tech,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI merges blockchain and AI to tackle key challenges like bias, scalability, and transparency, with its PoI consensus and AIVM. Table of Contents Overview What is Lightchain AI? Features Tokenomics Roadmap Pros and cons Conclusion Blockchain and AI are both phenomenal technologies, and the combination of these two holds the power to bring impactful change in the world. But just as there are opportunities, there are also several obstacles along this intertwined path. The first significant issue is that most AI systems are centralized and cannot be trusted with sensitive information. There’s certainly a possibility of data breaches and misuse. Second is the problem of bias . Most AI systems reflect the biases of their creators. A good example is how OpenAI’s ChatGPT responds to different political questions. A heavy bias is present in most, if not all, of the large LLMs that exist today. This is why governance and voting on the path forward of these models is important in maintaining a free and open ecosystem that isn’t bound by VCs and governments. Another problem is scalability. This issue seems to plague both AI and blockchain alike. And last but not least, there’s the lack of transparency. AI, unlike blockchain, is often not transparent , which discourages tech enthusiasts. However, there’s a new project at the intersection of blockchain and AI that addresses all of these issues — Lightchain AI. Let’s assess this project to learn more about its merits and demerits. Overview Website: Lightchain AI Blockchain: Lightchain AI blockchain Sector: AI and blockchain Token: LCAI What is Lightchain AI? Lightchain AI is a decentralized platform that integrates AI with blockchain. And it does this with the help of two programs. One is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), and the second is Proof of Intelligence (PoI). With the help of these two solutions, Lightchain AI aims to solve the scalability, privacy, and trust problems that currently exist in the crypto blockchain space. It also strives to help eradicate bias from AI models and LLMs. The team at Lightchain AI states that the platform provides an equitable, efficient, and privacy-preserving ecosystem for developers and participants. Let’s take a look at its features to gauge if these claims are true. Features Proof of Intelligence Proof of Intelligence is a consensus mechanism made to reward nodes for both providing resources to contribute to AI-intensive tasks as well as solving blocks. How does it differ from the popular Proof of Work or environment-conscious Proof of Stake? PoI gives incentives for contributions to AI development in the ecosystem. How does it work? First, the participating nodes receive modular AI tasks, according to their power level. Tasks include activities such as training machine learning models or running inference operations. Next, the nodes execute these tasks and produce cryptographic proofs, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). Then, the network checks these submissions using metrics such as accuracy or efficiency. Once these are validated, nodes are rewarded with Lightchain tokens. This method has a whole list of benefits. It is energy efficient, scalable and provides opportunities for nodes of different sizes and power capacities to take part. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine According to the Lightchain AI whitepaper, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine is a “specialized virtual machine that optimizes the execution of AI-specific tasks within the Lightchain AI ecosystem.” Basically, it’s a tool that has been built to handle complex AI tasks on the blockchain. This AI layer helps AI integrate well with blockchain, so that the whole program works in a smooth and effective manner. The AIVM also creates a secure and scalable environment for running AI models. This model even works with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. But, what’s most striking about this AI layer is that it is capable of evolving through the collaborative efforts of developers. In short, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine works like the heart of the ecosystem, pumping lifeblood to all the different parts of the system to make sure it’s all alive and kicking. Tokenomics The Lightchain Token ( LCAI ) is the token of the Lightchain AI ecosystem. This token is mainly used for three key purposes: Payment for AI tasks, staking for governance participation and access to premium AIVM features. The token distribution is carefully planned to support growth and avoid centralization. The total supply of tokens is allocated across different areas (see picture below). 40% of the tokens (4 billion LCAI) are reserved for the presale. 28.5% (2.85 billion LCAI) is dedicated to staking and rewards. 15% (1.5 billion LCAI) is set aside for liquidity and exchange listings. 6.5% (650 million LCAI) goes to the treasury and reserve. 5% (500 million LCAI) is allocated to the team. Another 5% (500 million LCAI) is for marketing and partnerships with Key Opinion Leaders. Lightchain AI also uses a smart economic design. When it comes to inflation control, initial inflation rates fund early ecosystem growth but decrease over time. The token burning mechanism is deflationary where a portion of transaction fees and AI task payments is burned. When it comes to pricing, gas fees for computational tasks are calculated dynamically based on task complexity and network load. Roadmap The Lightchain AI roadmap works in three key phases. In Phase 1 (Prototype Development), the team focuses on building the Proof of Intelligence consensus and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine. They also work on governance structures and community engagement. In Phase 2 (Testnet Rollout), the team conducts testnet deployment, performance optimization, and feedback gathering. The Testnet will act as a playground for developers who wish to perform bug bounties and other types of developer initiatives. Finally, in Phase 3 (Mainnet Launch), the team conducts the full activation of PoI and AIVM, and uses Validator and Contributor nodes. They also aim for partnership expansion. Currently, the team is in the Phase 1 phase of the roadmap. Pros and cons With its real-world utility, deflationary tokenomics and smart integration of AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI undoubtedly has a whole list of pros that attract both developers and investors looking for the next big thing. But are there any cons? While both the AIVM and PoI are exceptional feats of technology, they do appear to be overly complex. Lightchain’s PoI sits at the core of dividing work between nodes that join the network from computational AI tasks and solving blocks. The AVIM is a decentralized autonomous organization, which is similar to the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). However, the AVIM is upgraded and voted on based on the holder’s LCAI. While PoW and PoS offer rewards to miners who either stake ETH or provide resources, PoI solves two issues: an upgradable AIVM that is not static, and it resolves the centralization of the EVM by providing an AVIM, which is voted on upgrades by the token holders. Conclusion Lightchain AI is a blockchain ecosystem that runs on artificial intelligence. With smart solutions like the PoI Consensus and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), the Lightchain AI team aims to create a more fair, open, and free AI model. Currently in its presale, the project is gaining considerable traction both on social media and in mainstream media.

The company has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, now sitting on 1,873 BTC, with an average purchase price of $78,553 per Bitcoin. Between November 25 and December 4, 2024, Semler acquired 303 BTC for $29.3 million, averaging a cost of $96,779 per Bitcoin. This aggressive move is part of their broader strategy to integrate Bitcoin into their financial operations, which they claim aligns with shareholder interests. Semler Scientific has reported a 13.32% drop in short interest, with 892,000 shares now sold short, representing 13.28% of its tradable shares. Based on current trading volumes, it would take traders an average of 1.46 days to cover these positions. Funding the Bitcoin Buying Spree To fund these purchases, Semler leveraged an at-the-market (ATM) equity offering through its partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. Initially, they aimed to raise $50 million, but later doubled the offering to $100 million. As of now, they’ve generated $79.8 million in gross proceeds, fueling their Bitcoin acquisition strategy. What is BTC Yield? Semler has introduced a unique metric called BTC Yield to gauge the performance of its Bitcoin holdings. BTC Yield reflects the percentage change in the ratio between Bitcoin holdings and outstanding shares. Since the company adopted its Bitcoin treasury strategy in July 2024, their BTC Yield has reached an impressive 78.7%, with a 54.7% boost recorded in the most recent period. However, BTC Yield isn’t a profitability metric. It doesn’t represent traditional financial gains but instead highlights how Bitcoin investments align with shareholder equity. Balancing Risks and Opportunities Eric Semler, the company’s chairman, expressed optimism about their crypto strategy, emphasizing its potential for long-term shareholder benefits. Beyond Bitcoin, Semler is also seeking approval for options trading on their stock, signaling a diversification of their financial approach. That said, the company acknowledges risks, including Bitcoin’s volatility and their reliance on equity sales to fund acquisitions. Moreover, Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy reflects an assertive stance in the crypto market, with an average purchase price of $78,553 per BTC. The latest acquisition at a premium price of $96,779 per BTC underlines the company’s unwavering confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Marathon Digital Bitcoin Holdings Surge with $850M Note Offering; MARA Stock Soars 59% , Bitcoin’s Current Status Bitcoin surged to $103,047.71 early today, marking a significant milestone as its market capitalization climbed 6.84% to $2.03 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.

Similarly, the altcoin season index has risen to 85, as most altcoins continue to underperform Bitcoin. Below are some of the top altcoins to consider buying and holding. Chainlink Chainlink ( LINK ) is the largest oracle in the crypto space, supporting major networks like AAVE, Compound, and Spark by bridging off-chain data to on-chain platforms. Its total value secured has surpassed $38 billion, with whales steadily accumulating the token. Chainlink price has strong technicals as it has just moved above the upper side of the cup and handle pattern. It has also formed a bullish pennant pattern, which is made up of a long vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. In most cases, this pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout. LINK has formed a golden cross on Nov. 22, as the 200-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages flipped positively. With these indicators, LINK’s next target could be $40, representing a 73% increase from its current level.

It has broken above the first support of the Schiff pitchfork, while the MACD indicator is above the zero line, and the RSI stands at 65. These technicals indicate that SHIB could rise further, with a target of $0.000045, up by 45% from its current level.

Pepe is also attempting to move above the year-to-date high at $0.000026, its highest swing on November 14. By measuring the distance between the upper and lower side of the cup, there are signs that the coin will jump to $0.00002860 in the near term.

37258476,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98419,1733415050,‘Oustanding Choice’ — Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Hails Trump’s SEC Chair Appointment,"United States President-elect Donald Trump announced on Dec. 4 on his social media platform Truth Social that he had picked longtime crypto-friendly Paul Atkins, a former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to lead the regulatory agency as its next chair. Trump Taps Crypto Supporter Paul Atkins To Lead SEC In Trump’s Wednesday announcement, he described Atkins as a “proven leader.” “He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of investors, and that provide capital to make our economy the best in the world,” Trump wrote. “He also recognizes that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to making America greater than ever before.” Atkins served as an SEC commissioner for six years (from 2002 to 2008) following his appointment by President George W. Bush. He will succeed outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who previously announced he’d step down on Jan. 20 when Trump is sworn into office as the next U.S. president. Ripple CEO Bradley Garlinghouse hailed Atkins’ appointment as an “outstanding choice.” Garlinghouse thinks that Atkins will bring “common sense” back to the Commission. “Along with Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, it’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto, restoring freedom of choice, economic growth, and innovation,” the Ripple boss added. Crypto Industry Highly Optimistic Amid Gensler’s Departure Current SEC czar Gensler has gained notoriety for his aggressive anti-crypto stance. During his tenure, the regulator unleashed a handful of enforcement actions against prominent crypto companies such as Binance , Coinbase , OpenSea , Kraken , and Consensys , among others. The SEC also categorized several major cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), Cardano’s ADA, and Polygon (MATIC) as unregistered securities, drawing the ire of most crypto community members. Notably, crypto prices have been soaring following news of Gensler’s voluntary exit and Trump’s election victory. Moreover, filings for U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surged after his resignation announcement, with Bitwise , WisdomTree , Canary Capital , and 21Shares all submitting applications to the SEC. Meanwhile, ahead of the incoming regulatory leadership transition, 18 states have lodged a lawsuit against the SEC and its current commissioners, including Gensler, over its crackdown on the crypto industry.",POSITIVE,ADA | MATIC,ADA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MATIC | REGULATION,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/oustanding-choice-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-hails-trumps-sec-chair-appointment/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

This downturn knocked XRP out of its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with Tether’s USDT taking its place at $135.8 billion. The price drop came amid Ripple’s announcement that it would delay the launch of its $RLUSD stablecoin , fueling market uncertainty and raising investor concerns. XRP Token Faces Decline Amid Panic Selling Concerns Ripple revealed on Wednesday that the launch of its $RLUSD stablecoin would be postponed, citing the need for final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services.

We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards. Stay tuned… — Ripple (@Ripple) December 4, 2024 While the decision was made to ensure regulatory compliance, the announcement created uncertainty in the market, affecting XRP’s performance. In the wake of the announcement, XRP trading volumes plunged from $32 billion to $16 billion, highlighting mounting selling pressure. Overall, the token’s 24-hour trading volume dropped nearly 40%, settling at $26.02 billion. Adding to the challenges, a broader surge in stablecoin activity may also be influencing XRP’s downturn. Over the past day, stablecoin volumes surged by 26.88%, reaching $327.85 billion, further shifting market dynamics. Analysts, however, maintain an optimistic outlook for XRP’s recovery. #XRP – $2: The Next Macro Support? ***************************************************** Alert: This is your wake-up call!

Its price was worth $101,791 at press time, and it hit an all-time high of $103,587 just this morning. The only giants worth more than Bitcoin right now are Apple and Microsoft. The apex crypto has managed to surpass Amazon, Alphabet, and even Nvidia in terms of market value. The broader crypto market also saw a sharp increase, with its total capitalization climbing to $3.5 trillion. Bitcoin is taking it this year Bitcoin is up 140% in 2024, with nearly half of that growth occurring after the recent U.S. presidential election, with optimism surrounding pro-crypto policies expected under President-elect Donald Trump. The announcement of Paul Atkins as the nominee for SEC chair has been a driving factor in the $100,000 milestone. Atkins is a crypto advocate, a contrast to outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose tenure was aggressive. From its creation during the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin has defied critics, steadily building a foundation for adoption. Its original purpose, outlined in the Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, was to create a peer-to-peer financial system free from centralized control. That vision is now resonating with major institutions. The bull run is also closely tied to increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. And Trump’s administration has laid the groundwork for policies that could further boost Bitcoin. Proposals include eliminating taxes on crypto transactions, creating a national Bitcoin reserve, and encouraging public crypto IPOs, so it’s justifiable that everyone is super bullish right now. Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital said , “Over the long term, I’m bullish. It won’t be a straight lineup, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the U.S., it’ll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice.” Trump is also expected to announce who will be the first-ever White House Crypto Czar on Inauguration Day. Hilariously enough, the president told the entire industry “You’re welcome!” for Bitcoin hitting $100k, proudly taking credit for this iconic bull run.

Bitcoin, the market leader, is on a parabolic rally after surging past the $100,000 barrier for the first time on Wednesday. This represents a staggering 120% year-to-date return. But if ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood is to be believed, this is only the beginning. Bitcoin Is A “Much Bigger Idea Than Gold” In a recent post on the X platform, Cathie Wood, CEO and founder of ARK Invest, shared her thoughts on the recent appointment of crypto-friendly Paul Atkins as the next U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair. Wood noted that Atkins will “free digital assets from Gary Gensler’s chokehold and protect private property rights in the digital world.” She also highlighted that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently likened Bitcoin to gold. “It’s like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” Powell said on Wednesday. However, the ARK boss suggested that the notion of Bitcoin is bigger than gold, particularly because of its borderless nature. She quipped: “Indeed, ARK Invest believes that Bitcoin is a much bigger idea than gold.” Wood then compared Bitcoin to gold, noting that the precious metal boasts a $15 trillion market value. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a market capitalization of $2 trillion at press time — which signals that it has more room to grow. Bitcoin reached the highly coveted $100,000 milestone yesterday, over 15 years after its enigmatic inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, launched the OG crypto. “Even after breaking through $100,000, Bitcoin still is in early innings,” Wood asserted. Crypto-Friendly Trump 2.0 SEC Bitcoin’s upsurge to historic highs has in large part been spurred by Donald Trump’s historic presidential election win on Nov. 6. The pro-crypto President-elect has congratulated Bitcoin enthusiasts on the heels of BTC crossing $100K: “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” Ending the SEC’s crypto crackdown by appointing a crypto-friendly person to replace Gensler was one of Trump’s promises to crypto voters on the campaign trail and a highlight of his keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. The Bitcoin rally is expected to continue into 2025 as the crypto foe leaves office on January 20.

37258717,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51441,1733414427,"BlockDAG & BVB Call It Quits! Bitcoin Unstable in South Korea, ADA Targets Growth","In the crypto sphere, political and regulatory developments are becoming key players in market stability. Once again, Bitcoin grabs the spotlight globally as South Korea’s declaration of martial law sends ripples of significant volatility through the market, with Bitcoin’s price tumbling more than 30% on Upbit. This ripple effect of Bitcoin’s fluctuation is felt across the cryptocurrency landscape. Yet, there’s an optimistic stance from analysts on Cardano (ADA), with price projections soaring to $1.60 by 2025, spurred by its thriving DeFi ecosystem. Simultaneously, BlockDAG (BDAG) has withdrawn from its partnership with the German football giant Borussia Dortmund (BVB) due to these regulatory alterations. Despite this, BlockDAG’s presale has surged past the $157 million mark, affirming its ability to keep pace with the rapidly evolving market. Bitcoin News: South Korea’s Martial Law Spurs Extreme Market Fluctuations Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines around the world as the declaration of martial law in South Korea causes dramatic market fluctuations. This significant political move saw Bitcoin’s value plummet from $96,000 to $62,000 on Upbit in mere minutes. This local shock also affected the international markets, where Bitcoin’s value briefly dropped to $93,600. Opportunistic traders pounced on arbitrage possibilities, leading to a recovery of Bitcoin’s price to $89,000 on Upbit. This showcases Bitcoin’s vulnerability to geopolitical shifts, solidifying its position as both a speculative asset and a digital reserve of value. Cardano Might Hit $1.60 By March Analysts are buzzing about the future price of Cardano (ADA), with many predicting it could double by 2025. After a notable 200% rise in November, Cardano now trades at $1.07, bolstered by a surge in demand for DeFi projects. Estimates suggest ADA might hit $1.60 by March 2025, depending on Bitcoin’s expected rise to $125,000, a factor that might be worrisome as Bitcoin experiences downturns on Upbit and other major exchanges. Cardano’s potential for growth is largely tied to its robust DeFi ecosystem and ongoing market integration. While the forecasts are promising, the continued momentum of ADA will hinge on broader blockchain industry movements. Regulatory Shifts Prompt BlockDAG to End BVB Partnership BlockDAG is demonstrating why adaptability is crucial in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. Following the MiCA 2 regulatory changes affecting sponsorship agreements in Germany, BlockDAG has cut ties with Borussia Dortmund (BVB). Looking forward, BlockDAG is now doubling down on its international expansion, including a new sponsorship with Inter Milan and an expanding ecosystem poised to make it a leading crypto contender for 2025. BlockDAG’s growth figures are impressive, having raised over $157 million, sold 16.8 billion BDAG coins, and provided early adpters with an ROI of 2240%. Priced at just $0.0234 in its 26th batch, the coin offers significant buying potential based on its foundational technology. BlockDAG stands out as a versatile blockchain platform, unlike Bitcoin, which is mainly seen as a value reserve, or Cardano, which shines in the DeFi sector but remains heavily dependent on Bitcoin’s market trends. BlockDAG’s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) framework ensures unparalleled scalability, speed, and security, positioning it for significant growth with features like WASM compatibility, cross-chain functionality, and a developer-friendly environment. Why BlockDAG is the Crypto to Watch As Bitcoin and Cardano weather turbulent market conditions, BlockDAG emerges as one of the top cryptos to buy as the market anticipates a bullish 2025. While Bitcoin’s news catalyzes rapid market shifts and Cardano’s dependency on Bitcoin’s performance remains a hot topic, BlockDAG’s innovative approach to scalability and security distinguishes it. Its $157 million presale, impressive ROI, and swift expansion have bolstered community trust. BlockDAG’s commitment to innovation and leadership, with features like WASM compatibility and cross-chain functionality, positions it as the optimal asset for those seeking sustained growth. For crypto enthusiasts seeking a dependable and dynamic project, BlockDAG represents the most compelling buying opportunity.

Over $714 million has come into the top altcoin in the last week, showing that both institutional and individual buyers are becoming more interested in it. The ETHA ETF from BlackRock and the FETH ETF from Fidelity are leading the charge. Together, they have brought in about $140 million. The support of major financial institutions is boosting activity and demonstrating that Ethereum is becoming popular in the conventional finance sector. This flood of capital demonstrates how Ethereum may unite centralized and decentralized financial systems. Analysts Anticipate Mid-Term Target Of $6,000 For Ethereum According to market experts, the level of support for Ethereum stands at $3,300. This is a safe place for investors to start because it strikes a good balance between risk and return. Analysts propose a mid-term price target of $6,000 in case Ethereum continues its ascent. Some analysts even anticipate a long-term price of $10,000. If #Ethereum $ETH experiences a pullback, keep an eye on the $3,300 support level — a potential buying opportunity. Our mid-term target remains $6,000, with a long-term outlook of $10,000! https://t.co/mQQOjrKBFM pic.twitter.com/OEvDIV0ZpD — Ali (@ali_charts) December 4, 2024 Meanwhile, CoinCodex predicts that the price of Ethereum will have gone up by 6.17 percent to $4,052.34 by January 4, 2025.

Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst Additional Stimulus & Growth In TVL The dominance of Ethereum in the DeFi market was cemented when its total value locked surged by $4.81 billion within a period of one week. However, while other networks, including Base and Hyperliquid, had their TVLs rise, Ethereum is still viewed as the leader. Ethereum’s trajectory appears optimistic due to its robust ETF inflows, bullish technical outlook, and increasing TVL. Although it may require some time to accumulate $6,000, the narrative is compelling due to institutional support and steady momentum. Ethereum remains a fundamental component of the cryptocurrency market, combining investor confidence with innovation.

37258352,https://blockworks.co/news/sec-chair-nominee-crypto-past,1733414400,What SEC chair nominee Paul Atkins has previously said about crypto,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto is “really exciting,” former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins said in a podcast interview last year. In that same interview, he noted that the FTX collapse just happened to occur in crypto but essentially, fraud is fraud. He compared Sam Bankman-Fried’s actions to Bernie Madoff’s. Aside from public appearances, it’s clear that Atkins — who, in case you somehow missed it, is officially President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to take over the SEC — is not only knowledgeable about crypto but has been active in the space for years. On paper, Atkins looks pretty pro-crypto, but I was curious to get some idea of who Atkins is and what he’s like. Which, of course, could give some readthrough on how he’d lead the SEC if he were to take the helm — which, as my colleague Casey Wagner pointed out — won’t be for a while because he has to get through the nomination process. The deal’s not done yet, so temper your expectations. He’s been a part of Securitize’s advisory board since 2019, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told me. “He’s definitely going to bring a different attitude toward the space that is less about enforcement actions and litigation and more about figuring out what’s the right regulation for letting this industry flourish,” he continued. Domingo knew of Atkins from his SEC days and from his work as co-chair for the Token Alliance which was launched by the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Atkins, Domingo said, is likely going to be “less controversial” and he’s more likely to have “a dialog with the industry participants to figure things out … Not having this animosity toward the industry, but somebody can sit with people and understand, you know, what needs to be done, so that there is investor protection and there is a certain type of regulation, but at the same time, the industry can actually grow.” In the Free the People podcast episode I mentioned above, Atkins said it was “too bad” that a lot of crypto companies “couldn’t comply” with the current rules “the way they’re written.” He also praised Hester Peirce, who he previously worked with. “If the SEC were more accommodating and would deal straightforwardly with these various firms, I think it would be a lot better” for crypto companies to work directly in the US instead of going overseas, Atkins said. While Domingo’s sad to be losing Atkins as an adviser, the US is gaining a “really good” potential leader of the SEC, he said.

37258134,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27634,1733414297,BNB Price Outpaces Bitcoin and Ethereum with 220% Annual Surge,"BNB Price Outpaces Bitcoin and Ethereum Binance Coin (BNB) is setting some records in the cryptocurrency market; it has outpaced Bitcoin and Ethereum with an impressive 220% gain over the past year. By contrast, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown just 133% and 71%, respectively. Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s founder, pointed out how well the cryptocurrency has been doing, saying that traders often focus on short-term price movements and fail to look at the bigger picture of BNB’s growth story. Key Drivers Behind BNB’s Rally Robust DeFi Ecosystem on Binance Smart Chain The Binance Smart Chain ecosystem has gained significant traction, amassing up to $6 billion in total value locked , thus positioning it as the fourth largest DeFi platform in the world, after Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. Moving on to the BSC-based DEX protocols, the volume for the last 30 days was $9.91 billion, while the cumulative is $1.17 trillion. Deflationary pressure is supported through the consistent coin burns seen on BNB. To date, in the recent quarter, Binance burned 2.02 million coins. With this, Binance hopes that over a longer-term focus, the entire supply could taper down to just 100 million coins for scarcity, encouraging price appreciation in return. Utility Addition Through Stablecoin BFUSD The introduction of BFUSD has really increased the utility of BNB, Binance’s new 20%-yielding stablecoin. This new offering would attract investors and create fresh momentum for the coin. Regulatory Clarity Regulatory uncertainties, especially those surrounding Binance, have reduced. Changpeng Zhao recently settled all legal issues in the U.S. There are fewer market fears now, ensuring more stability for Binance and its coin, BNB. Technical Indicators Show More Upside The BNB technical charts indicate more growth ahead: Cup and Handle Pattern: The formation of the bullish pattern on the weekly chart points to a possible 70% rally toward $1,170. Murrey Math Lines: The movement of the coin above the “weak, stop & reverse” level could propel it to as high as $875. For now, however, if it drops below $625, the prediction will be void. Conclusion With strong fundamentals, robust technical indicators, and reduced regulatory concerns, BNB is well-positioned to continue higher. If the current trends continue, BNB could achieve new highs, targeting $1,170. Investors, however, should monitor key support levels to manage risks.",POSITIVE,BNB,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/bnb-price-outpaces-bitcoin-and-ethereum/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png
37258132,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98415,1733414247,Tron Price Hitting New All-Time Highs as Bulls Takeover Demand,"Tron (TRX) price has hit a new all-time high above $0.4 following skyrocketing demand. These inflows in the last 72 hours follow a wider bullish turnaround in the market as coins shake off losses recorded at the start of the week. Tron’s momentum has increased analysts’ projections for an imminent altcoin season as early as January 2025. TRX attracted bulls as trade activity spiked in the ecosystem. The total crypto market cap gained 2.56%, surpassing $3.47 trillion, while volumes grew 21%. In the last 72 hours, TRON has been up 17%, taking its market cap above $28 billion. Daily trading volumes grew 116% which is a sign of bullish activity. Weekly gains for the asset stand at 28%, while monthly inflows rose to 47%. TRX is up 102% this year, consistently hitting levels not seen in several months. Why Is Tron Surging? Tron’s rise is due to several factors, including investments, its founder, and other activities. The token continued its positive tempo after Justin Tron announced a $30 million investment in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance. The move sparked renewed interest in Tron as Donald Trump’s win soared market prices on the back of anticipated crypto regulations. “ We are thrilled to invest $30 million in World Liberty Financial @worldlibertyfi as its largest investor. The U.S. is becoming the blockchain hub, and Bitcoin owes it to @realDonaldTrump! TRON is committed to making America great again and leading innovation. Let’s go!” Sun wrote on X. This remains the game changer for many assets as whales increase wallet holdings with speculation of growing adoption. Furthermore, Google searches for the asset are up threefold, with skyrocketing demand. Altcoin Bulls Await Season The crypto market is moving towards an altcoin season , usually characterized by capital flows from Bitcoin to other crypto assets. Multiple analysts have flagged spikes in top altcoins in the last few months as many break or test all-time highs. A major reason for this is the declining Bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin’s dominance plunged below its two-year support as funds trickled into other assets. The rise of Bitcoin to new highs after Trump’s win led to profit-taking by several whales. Some assets were withdrawn, while others were converted to altcoins in anticipation of a bull phase. Although Ethereum struggles, XRP is up 21% this week, while Cardano surged 18% in the same time frame.",POSITIVE,TRX,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | TRX,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/tron-price-hitting-new-all-time-highs-as-bulls-takeover-demand/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Archax and XDC Network ( XDC ) emphasized ease of access and compliance as critical factors in unlocking the potential of RWA tokenization for institutional players, according to a blog post . Keith O’Callaghan, head of structuring at Archax, commented: “Innovation and evolution of digital assets has been at our core since inception.

37258474,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623286,1733413851,Semler Scientific announces another 303 BTC purchase as price breaks records,"Corporate buyers for Bitcoin (BTC) have entered a streak, as the leading coin’s price is close to record levels. This time, Semler Scientific announced its latest purchase of 303 BTC. Semler Scientific is rising in the ranks of corporate buyers. As Bitcoin (BTC) set new records above $104,000, Semler Scientific announced its latest purchase. Announcements of corporate buying are made after the fact but still work to support the market sentiment. The company has taken up the model of buying BTC to achieve yield for its shareholders. Semler Scientific used its own cashflows to acquire a bigger BTC treasury. The company has also considered issuing debt or convertible bonds to acquire more BTC. After the latest purchase, BTC retained its new level for the day at $102,597.80. Semler Scientific’s purchase is relatively small compared to the latest additions of MicroStrategy and Mara Holdings but still signals a readiness for building bigger corporate treasuries. In the past four weeks, fundraising and BTC purchases accelerated, turning into a staple for boosting BTC sentiment. The latest MicroStrategy purchase happened as BTC dipped under $90,000, before continuing to its record rally. Unlike passive holders like Tesla, Inc., Semler Scientific also aims for yield for its shareholders, hinging on BTC’s appreciation. Semler Scientific is on track to join the top 10 corporate holders. Long-term predictions see almost all big companies adding some BTC to their treasuries. Semler Scientific achieves high yield, while shares rally Semler Scientific was formerly a medical technology company but pivoted to crypto ownership in May. The company has built up a relatively small treasury of 1,873 BTC. After the latest purchase, Semler Scientific achieved a cost basis of $78,553 per BTC. The latest purchase was completed at an average price of $96,779 per BTC. The new addition follows purchases by MicroStrategy and Mara Holdings , expanding the trend of yield-bearing BTC treasuries. Semler Scientific has achieved a higher yield of 54.7% to date. Semler Scientific is a relatively late arrival to the BTC buying game and has a higher cost basis. The rising BTC price, however, is not slowing down corporate buying. Instead, most of the top 20 corporate holders have updated their treasuries in the past few days. Joining the corporate holder trend had a double effect on Semler Scientific. The company’s shares rallied from a low of $23 in September, up to their current one-year peak of $63. SMLR is still far from its post-pandemic high of $149.99. Most corporate stocks tied to BTC purchases have rallied by 100% with ease, based on adopting MicroStrategy’s playbook of buying more BTC. Semler Scientific is one of the few entrants from outside the selection of mining companies. Backed by BlackRock and Vanguard, the company did not hesitate to raise another $50M share sale in November, in preparation for more BTC purchases. Corporate buying adds to bullish sentiment The recent corporate buying spree is adding to the bullish sentiment of the latest BTC rally. While the purchases are not gigantic on the scale of traditional finance, they are creating a supply crunch for BTC. Easily available BTC for big transfers are becoming scarce, as more large entities are holding their coins closely. The recent corporate reserves combine with ETF buying and holding to create a new category of BTC owners. On-chain data shows whales hold a relatively small amount of BTC. On the other hand, as a whole, corporate owners are advancing in their control over the supply of 21M coins. In total, BTC in the hands of corporations, ETF, and large-scale government holdings, already covers 13.60% of all BTC. That scale of holding of more than 2.8M BTC already surpassed the miner reserves of 1.91M BTC. The amount is still relatively lower compared to Satoshi Nakamoto’s initial holdings, as well as supposedly lost or locked BTC. Corporate buying was already observed months ago, with warnings that retail traders may be selling too fast. After months of sideways trading for BTC, the year-end rally turned even more profitable for companies that built BTC treasuries.

37259358,https://cryptonews.com/?p=317044,1733413836,"Bitcoin Surpasses $100K, Meme Coin Boom Ahead as Crypto All-Stars Presale Hits $8.7M","With over $8.7 million already raised, Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is quickly becoming one of the top token presales of 2024. This meme coin project, which introduces “MemeVault” — the industry’s first unified meme coin staking protocol — is now just $1.3 million away from hitting the $10 million milestone. And all of this is happening amid Bitcoin ($BTC) dominating headlines as it recently broke the $100,000 mark. For those who missed out on Bitcoin’s rise 15 years ago, when six-figure prices seemed beyond the realm of possibility, Crypto All-Stars offers a chance at redemption. Early momentum and growing interest in the presale are signaling huge potential for the project, making it a new door opening for investors seeking the next big thing. $STARS tokens are still up for grabs at $0.0016782 per token. But with only 15 days left in the presale, time is running out. Once the token hits the exchange, its price could soar, making now a rare chance for early investors to secure their stake in Crypto All-Stars at a steep discount. Crypto All-Stars has got Bitcoin beat in this category Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 happened around midday during the Asian trading session, briefly flirting with that price level earlier. After breaking through this psychological barrier, it surged past it and now sits at $102,914 per token. Source: CoinGecko This milestone has sent ripples through the market, pushing the total crypto market cap up by 3.31% to a valuation of $3.69 trillion, while trading volumes increased by $359 billion, a 23.42% jump. Meme coins are riding this wave and are on track for another boom, surpassing a $128 billion market cap with trading volumes up 38.91% to $35.3 billion during the same period. Undoubtedly, Bitcoin continues to dominate market sentiment, driving growth across the sector. Its new price point is a reflection of how far the industry has come – an extraordinary achievement that early adopters could hardly have predicted. But as impressive as Bitcoin’s milestone is, it’s important to note that it didn’t achieve a $10 million market cap back in 2010. This is where Crypto All-Stars’ $STARS token stands out. In just four months, this relatively young, unlisted token has raised impressive capital – showing rapid growth despite its early stage. While factors like the current bull market and increasing adoption have played a role, the strong investor interest indicates that $STARS has significant potential to capture attention as it continues to develop. Though it’s too early to say if $STARS will reach the heights of Bitcoin, its unique approach and strong community support position it as one to watch in the coming months. What’s got investors Crypto All-Stars-struck? Crypto All-Stars has Bitcoin-like potential because of the massive upgrade it’s bringing to the meme coin space with MemeVault. While it’s technically a staking platform, it’s much more than just that. MemeVault brings together the top meme coins in one place, allowing users to stake them all through a single, unified protocol. The goal is simple: eliminate the complexity of managing multiple staking platforms and make it easier for users to earn rewards by staking everything in one spot. This streamlined approach saves time and maximizes returns, elevating meme coin investing further. Imagine staking popular tokens like Dogecoin ($DOGE), which gained 6.12% in the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu ($SHIB), up 4.53%, and Pepe ($PEPE), which jumped 4.78% in the same timeframe. With MemeVault, these coins can work together to bring in even more. But it gets even better, as the staking returns could be further amplified by simply holding $STARS. The more $STARS tokens you hold, the greater your staking rewards. In fact, it could even triple the usual returns. So not only does MemeVault make staking easier, but it also gives users the potential to earn way more. Crypto All-Stars is the only project in the space offering this, which is why it’s been generating significant media buzz. For example, Crypto All-Stars has caught the eye of one of crypto’s top influencers, Austin Hilton, who shared his thoughts on the project in a video to his 286,000 subscribers. Well-known media outlets like ReadWrite have highlighted its rocking fundraising campaign , while 99Bitcoins has named it one of the top tokens with high return potential for 2025. A Binance listing has pumped 80% of newly listed meme coins. Will $STARS be next? As the presale countdown winds down, $STARS is set for an exchange listing that will open the door to a broader investor base and increased liquidity, potentially driving its price even higher. While the exact exchange remains undisclosed, a fundraising campaign as successful as Crypto All-Stars’ could certainly attract attention from top-tier exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. If an exchange like Binance lists $STARS, it could follow in the footsteps of the 80% of tokens listed on the world’s largest exchange that have seen massive success. Coins like First Neiro on Ethereum ($NEIRO), Moo Deng ($MOODENG), and PopCat ($POPCAT) have delivered life-changing returns after their Binance listings, with gains of 7,594.18%, 395.28%, and 223.96%, respectively. Source: Ai But it’s not just the Binance effect that $STARS investors can look forward to. As a key asset in the MemeVault ecosystem, $STARS already enjoys consistent demand from stakers. What makes $STARS even more attractive is its unique dynamics: most investors are choosing to hodl rather than sell, as holding $STARS boosts their rewards within MemeVault. This ongoing demand, paired with the scarcity created by hodling, can drive the price of $STARS even higher, making it a powerful long-term investment. $STARS is shaping up to be the top December play in the market Like Christmas, the $10 million funding milestone for Crypto All-Stars is just around the corner, but given how things are unfolding, it looks like it’ll arrive much sooner. If you haven’t secured your $STARS yet, now’s the time. Head to the Crypto All-Stars website , connect your wallet (e.g., Best Wallet), and swap ETH, USDT, or BNB for $STARS. Bank cards are also accepted for your convenience. You can even use popular meme coins like $FLOKI, $SHIB, $DOGE, and $PEPE to grab $STARS tokens through the site’s easy-to-use widget. Newly purchased $STARS can also be staked in a separate staking platform designed for $STARS, which currently yields a 255% APY, giving new investors an opportunity to grow their holdings before the eventual launch of Meme Vault. Crypto All-Stars’ smart contract has been thoroughly audited by top firms Coinsult and SolidProof, confirming that its code is secure and free of critical errors.

Market experts and analysts are discussing factors that led to the historic move and speculating about how high bitcoin can go, given the current state of the market. CryptoPotato received remarks from analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex and the on-chain analytics platform Nansen. Additionally, founders of traditional finance firms heavily invested in the leading digital currency dropped their opinions on the win. Analysts React to BTC Above $100K According to Bitfinex analysts, the halving earlier this year influenced bitcoin’s move past $100,000. Following the event in April, BTC supply was reduced by half, as was its emission rate and inflation, leading to a slow supply shock. The United States Federal Reserve avoided a “plausible recession” and a major job market crisis, contributing to bitcoin’s ascent to $100,000. To Bitfinex analysts, preventing a real estate collapse despite rising housing loan default rates added to macroeconomic stability, creating a favorable environment for BTC to thrive. Another factor is Federal Reserve Chairperson Jerome Powell’s comparison of BTC to gold at the New York Times DealBook Summit on December 4. He said the leading cryptocurrency competes with the precious metal, not the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin Short-term Target at $112k Top on the list is the emergence of the crypto-friendly Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States. During his campaign, Trump took a pro-crypto stance and won over the digital asset community. Now, he has appointed the crypto-friendly Paul Atkins as the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nansen’s Principal Research Analyst, Aurelie Barthere, said Atkins’ nomination helped bitcoin’s last leg to $100,000. As BTC continues its surge, Bitfinex has placed its short-term target at $112,000 – the asset was worth $101,820 at press time. Analysts asserted that trading activities will decline over the holiday period; however, the market will continue to see long-term holder distribution. From Nansen’s perspective, December’s positive seasonality should prevent any major corrections in bitcoin’s price. However, traders’ expectations could be disappointed if Trump prioritizes tariff and immigration-related policies after his inauguration on January 20. Regardless, Richard Teng, CEO of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, believes Bitcoin’s journey to $100,000 is a testament to how bold ideas can shape the digital future. Cathie Wood, founder of the asset manager Ark Invest, said : “Even after breaking through $100,000, bitcoin still is in early innings.” The post Experts and Analysts React to Bitcoin’s Surge Past $100K: What’s Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/experts-and-analysts-react-to-bitcoins-surge-past-100k-whats-next/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37257870.jpeg

This facility was precisely built with a dual focus on physical and digital security, resulting in a strong environment for the protection of precious digital assets. This modern bunker in Buenos Aires enhances Prosegur’s current facility in São Paulo, Brazil. This positioning strategically places Prosegur as a top provider of comprehensive crypto custody solutions in Latin America. Prosegur has received official approval from the Argentinian National Assets Commission (CNV) to operate in the country, coinciding with the debut of the Buenos Aires Bunker. This essential regulatory authorization strengthens the company’s commitment to compliance and operational legitimacy. Prosegur’s successful navigation of the complicated regulatory landscape demonstrates its commitment to providing a secure and trustworthy environment for crypto asset custodianship. Prosegur’s hybrid approach to crypto custody Prosegur’s novel security strategy incorporates many levels of protection, combining offline physical infrastructure with military-grade cryptographic security procedures. This architecture is intended to provide optimal protection against a wide range of potential dangers. According to corporate spokespersons, private keys connected with crypto assets will be securely housed within the facility’s reinforced grounds, considerably reducing the risk of cyberattacks, which have become increasingly common in today’s digital landscape. This hybrid security strategy distinguishes the Buenos Aires crypto bunker as a one-of-a-kind and extremely secure institutional digital asset custody solution in the Argentine market. Prosegur Crypto’s Executive Chairman, José Ángel Fernández, highlighted the facility’s strategic significance. “With this crypto bunker, we reinforce our position as leaders in digital asset custody in Latin America, offering a solution that combines our extensive expertise in physical security with cutting-edge technological innovation,” he said. This powerful message demonstrates Prosegur’s constant dedication to upholding the highest industry standards and leading the way in safe and effective asset management methods. Prosegur Crypto and Argentina’s digital transformation The debut of the crypto bunker aligns with the substantially increased popularity of cryptocurrencies in Argentina. According to Chainalysis’ report, Argentina ranks 15th internationally in the use of crypto assets, indicating a significant and developing trend in the country’s financial behaviour. The country’s continued challenges with high inflation rates and significant currency instability have prompted both individuals and businesses to seek other financial solutions, such as digital assets, which are regarded to be more stable and reliable. However, Prosegur Crypto’s service is more than just custodianship; it also wants to assist the tokenization of a variety of physical assets, including precious metals such as gold, as well as a wide range of financial assets oriented at investors. The company intends to provide specialized services targeted to the specific demands of financial institutions, government organizations, and investment funds, ensuring a safe environment for properly managing and administering digital assets. This strategic direction demonstrates Prosegur’s comprehensive and forward-thinking approach to meeting the changing needs and difficulties of Argentina’s dynamic financial environment. The future of crypto custody The expanding legal framework governing crypto assets in Argentina, particularly under the supervision of the CNV, places Prosegur as an important ally for businesses seeking compliance in this complicated industry. This collaboration position is critical as a growing number of businesses strive to meet new legal requirements while also guaranteeing the security of their digital assets. Prosegur Crypto strives to make compliance transitions more seamless, establishing an environment in which innovation and regulatory adherence can coexist efficiently, ultimately benefiting all parties. As bitcoin use grows and there is a growing emphasis on security measures, Prosegur is well-positioned to maintain its leadership position in the Latin American digital asset environment. Prosegur’s recent entry into Argentina with its comprehensive crypto asset custody solution reflects more than simply the company’s dedication to meeting the pressing demands of a fast-evolving financial environment. It also highlights the huge and growing interest in cryptocurrencies, as well as the continuing regulatory reforms influencing the future of digital banking in the region. Prosegur Crypto is positioned to take the lead in this disruptive journey, assuring the security, compliance, and innovative growth of digital assets across Latin America.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dawgz AI emerges as the new crypto sensation, sparking comparisons to Dogecoin’s meteoric 2021 rise Table of Contents The Dogecoin story Dawgz AI: Poised to follow Dogecoin’s footsteps How to purchase Dawgz AI Conclusion The cryptocurrency market has been dominated by tales of unbelievable gains, where every bull run spotlights a token stealing the show. Dogecoin (DOGE) went from a humorous meme coin to a financial phenomenon in 2021, delivering life-changing rewards. All eyes are now on Dawgz AI (DAGZ), a new contender that is drawing comparisons with Dogecoin’s explosive rise. Can Dawgz AI really be the next meme coin to turn a modest $1000 investment into a staggering $2.8 million like DOGE? You might also like: The path to AI: Decentralized, embodied, and on-chain | Opinion The Dogecoin story Dogecoin, which emerged in 2013 as a joke inspired by the “DOGE” meme featuring a Shiba Inu, shocked the world by reaching a market cap of $62 billion in 2021. The meme coin’s price skyrocketed after Trump won the U.S. presidency, closing at $0.42191 on Dec. 1—a stunning 82,073% gain from the time it was created. Dogecoin’s price may continue its strong upward movement when Bitcoin passes $100,000 since the two have a correlation coefficient of 0.98 . According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez on X (formerly known as Twitter), Dogecoin is poised for a massive 2,400% rally against Bitcoin. This would lead to massive returns for those holding DOGE, especially early investors. Dawgz AI: Poised to follow Dogecoin’s footsteps Much like the early days of Dogecoin, Dawgz AI positions itself as the breakout meme coin of 2024. By combining the power of artificial intelligence with the fun, community-driven meme culture, DAGZ is here to change the game in the meme coin space. The token applies AI to help users maximize their crypto returns and allows for a very interactive and engaging community. Dawgz AI’s unique approach By leveraging AI, DAGZ has created a sophisticated trading system that is able to analyse the market and only execute high-probability trades. This technology is designed to assist investors in generating returns without the necessity of continuous monitoring the market, thereby addressing one of the main challenges associated with cryptocurrency trading. The token’s presale, which launched on November 14, raised an impressive $260,000 by November 30, highlighting the project’s potential. Currently priced at $0.00177, the token is expected to rise to $0.00702 once it launches on major exchanges, giving early investors the chance to position themselves for significant gains. https://twitter.com/Dawgz_AI/status/1861762327407644790 Dawgz AI’s token distribution and community focus Dawgz AI has its tokenomics planned to lead to long-term growth: 30% of the total supply is allocated for presale, 20% for staking rewards, 10% for liquidity pools, and 24% for marketing. The project gives out 15% to the community in the form of rewards and puts 1% toward its foundation. Such distribution ensures a balanced approach, rewarding early adopters while creating visibility through creating an active community. DAGZ fosters community engagement by organizing meme contests and events that give users a sense of belonging and encourage them to actively contribute to the development of the platform. This will not only increase user loyalty but also allow innovation as the platform evolves in line with the needs and creativity of its community. Dawgz AI’s smart contract was rigorously audited by SolidProof to identify vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and potential security risks before it was deployed on the blockchain. With its innovative use of AI and strong community engagement, Dawgz AI is positioned to follow in the footsteps of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. As the meme coin landscape continues to evolve, DAGZ could be the next breakout token, transforming modest investments into substantial rewards. How to purchase Dawgz AI Interested investors can participate in the presale by connecting their wallet on the Dawgz AI website and then buying DAGZ tokens using ETH, USDT, SOL, BNB, or USDC. After the presale has ended, users can claim their tokens in their wallets. Users who are interested in staking can stake their tokens before claiming. Simply press the buy button and stake. Keep an eye out for announcements on token listings and exchange partnerships to maximize investment. Conclusion In 2021, DOGE showed the world how strong meme coins can be. Now Dawgz AI looks ready to do it all over again. Dawgz has an AI-powered smart trading system and a supportive community that makes this a fantastic opportunity for any investor wanting to find the next big cryptocurrency. Having had a strong start, a presale that already raised a lot of money, and an extremely bright future ahead, DAGZ is likely the one that would turn a $1000 investment into $2.8 million.

Quaglini said during a CNBC interview that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) surge past the $100,000 psychological barrier marked the beginning of its institutional phase, following earlier technological advancements and the retail boom after exchanges became established. He predicted that mass sovereign demand for BTC would drive the cryptocurrency to even greater heights. Quaglini foresees fierce competition among the world’s 195 countries once Bitcoin gains widespread acceptance in the U.S. Trading data shows that 75% of BTC’s circulating supply is inactive , highlighting long-term holding strategies by current buyers. This scarcity could trigger “fear of missing out among nations aiming to acquire the $2 trillion crypto asset.

37276990,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107308,1733413195,Bitcoin Reaches Historic $2 Trillion Market Cap,"In a groundbreaking milestone, Bitcoin has achieved a $2 trillion market capitalization for the first time, solidifying its status as one of the world’s most valuable assets. This historic achievement was reported by The Kobeissi Letter on X (formerly Twitter), which noted that the milestone occurred just five minutes after Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 price level. According to Companies Market Cap , Bitcoin is now ranked as the seventh most valuable global asset , surpassing the likes of Tesla and Meta in market valuation. Breaking Down Bitcoin’s $2 Trillion Milestone Bitcoin’s journey to a $2 trillion market cap represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of cryptocurrencies. Here’s what it means: Market Capitalization Explained Market capitalization, or market cap, is calculated by multiplying the total circulating supply of Bitcoin by its current price. With Bitcoin trading above $100,000 and over 19 million coins in circulation, this milestone reflects both price appreciation and growing adoption. Top Global Asset Ranking At $2 trillion, Bitcoin has joined the ranks of the world’s most valuable assets, including: Gold Apple Microsoft Amazon Bitcoin now sits at seventh place , surpassing several Fortune 500 companies and traditional financial instruments in valuation. Key Drivers Behind Bitcoin’s Market Cap Surge Bitcoin’s rise to a $2 trillion market cap is the result of several converging factors: 1. Institutional Adoption The increasing involvement of institutional investors has played a critical role in driving demand. Hedge funds, corporations, and asset managers are allocating significant portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, recognizing its value as a store of wealth and inflation hedge. 2. U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals Recent approvals of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have created a new pathway for institutional and retail investors to access Bitcoin. The introduction of ETFs by financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity has significantly boosted market liquidity. 3. Global Economic Conditions Macroeconomic uncertainties, including inflation and currency devaluation, have prompted many investors to turn to Bitcoin as a reliable alternative to traditional assets. Bitcoin’s Global Impact: A $2 Trillion Asset Bitcoin’s newfound status as a $2 trillion asset has profound implications for both the cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets: Enhanced Credibility Crossing the $2 trillion threshold positions Bitcoin as a legitimate competitor to traditional financial instruments like gold and major equities. Mainstream Adoption This milestone is likely to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin by governments, corporations, and retail investors worldwide. Increased Scrutiny With greater prominence comes increased regulatory attention. Governments and financial regulators are expected to intensify their oversight of Bitcoin’s role in the global economy. Comparing Bitcoin to Other Major Assets At $2 trillion, Bitcoin’s market cap is now larger than the total value of several multinational corporations. Here’s how it compares: Asset/Company Market Cap Gold $13.2 Trillion Apple $3.15 Trillion Microsoft $2.6 Trillion Bitcoin $2 Trillion Amazon $1.75 Trillion Tesla $870 Billion Bitcoin’s ranking as the 7th most valuable global asset underscores its rapid growth and potential to rival traditional asset classes. Challenges Ahead for Bitcoin While Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap is a remarkable achievement, the road ahead is not without challenges: 1. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s price remains highly volatile, which could impact its ability to maintain this market cap. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty As Bitcoin gains prominence, regulatory scrutiny is expected to increase, potentially affecting its adoption and price stability. 3. Competition from Other Cryptocurrencies Ethereum and other blockchain networks are rapidly evolving, offering unique value propositions that could compete with Bitcoin for market share. What’s Next for Bitcoin? As Bitcoin continues to break records, analysts predict further growth in its market cap and adoption. Key developments to watch include: Broader ETF Adoption : Expanding access to Bitcoin ETFs could bring more institutional and retail investors into the market. Global Regulatory Frameworks : Clearer regulations could boost confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate investment vehicle. Technological Innovations : Advancements in Bitcoin’s network, such as scaling solutions and sustainability efforts, could enhance its value proposition. Expert Opinions on Bitcoin’s $2 Trillion Market Cap CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju Ju described Bitcoin’s milestone as a “validation of its role as the ultimate store of value,” urging investors to hold their positions amid growing institutional demand. The Kobeissi Letter The Kobeissi Letter highlighted the psychological significance of the $100,000 price level, noting that the achievement reflects a strong foundation for further growth. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ascent to a $2 trillion market cap is a testament to its growing acceptance and influence as a global financial asset. Fueled by institutional adoption, favorable regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors, Bitcoin has solidified its place among the world’s most valuable assets. While challenges remain, this milestone marks the beginning of a new chapter in Bitcoin’s evolution, with its potential to redefine the financial landscape becoming increasingly apparent.

The financial regulator said discussions are still ongoing and no decisions have been made. In a Dec. 4 statement, the FSC called for prudent reporting on the matter, “The corporate real-name account virtual asset provision will be further deliberated upon, and specific measures are not yet finalized.” Rumored Phased Plan Raises Questions Local reports by Korea Economic Daily claimed the FSC had prepared a plan for a gradual introduction of corporate cryptocurrency trading. The reported plan, which supposedly starts in 2025, first targets universities and local governments, then corporations and financial institutions. However, the denial by the FSC puts a question mark on the veracity of these reports. It has maintained that the agency would not rush into changing regulations without a proper review. Regulatory Hurdles for Corporate Crypto Participation Currently, corporations in South Korea face significant obstacles in accessing cryptocurrency markets. The country’s regulations mandate that crypto investors use real-name accounts at banks partnered with cryptocurrency exchanges. It turns out there are only five exchanges in the country that have secured any banking relationships. Most financial institutions refuse corporations an opportunity to open real-name accounts under harsh AML compliance requirements, blocking corporate participation in South Korea’s crypto market effectively. A Retail-Dominated Crypto Market South Korea’s crypto market is driven predominantly by retail investors, with the Korean won emerging as one of the top fiat trading pairs globally. Daily trading volumes often exceed $35 billion, underscoring the market’s scale. One such recent political event underlined the said activity. President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared martial law. Crypto trading volumes surged during these six hours of crisis till the decision was overturned by the National Assembly. What’s Next? Eventually, the FSC’s view on the corporate crypto accounts may give major blows to the market landscape. Permitting institutional and corporate participation might make South Korea’s reputation as a global crypto hub better. For now, though, the market still remains dependent on retail activity, as the regulatory environment evolves. Removing these barriers, significant growth can be unleashed in an already quite robust cryptocurrency ecosystem of South Korea.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO.

As the bull market progresses, Dogecoin is getting closer and closer to the $1 level.For investors holding 10K, 50K, or 100K units of Dogecoin, they stand to see their portfolios become worth $10,000, $50,000, and $100,000, respectively, if the $1 dream becomes a reality.Notably, acquiring 10,000 DOGE today requires an investment of $4,250. For 50K and 100K DOGE, these require investments of $21,250 and $42,500, which would see massive returns of 135% if Dogecoin reaches $1.Value of 10K, 50K, and 100K Dogecoin if It Hits $5 and $10Meanwhile, investors targeting higher price thresholds for Dogecoin , such as $5 and $10, stand to see their portfolios expand even more. Specifically, holdings of 10K and 50K, which are both worth around $4,250 and $21,250 today, would see their value increase to $50,000 and $250,000, respectively. As for those holding 100K tokens, their portfolio would expand to half a million dollars.If Dogecoin continues its upward trend and approaches the double-digit range, holders of 10K and 50K DOGE will see their investments grow to $100,000 and $500,000, respectively. Remarkably, holders of 100,000 Dogecoin would become millionaires if DOGE hits $10. Can Dogecoin Hit $1, $5, or $10?Notably, Dogecoin recently reached a new three-year high of $0.4775. This milestone has elevated market optimism that $1 is within reach, as the ongoing bull market likely has another 12 months to run. This gives Dogecoin ample time for further spectacular price growth.As a result, analysts are not seeing $1 as Dogecoin’s peak for this cycle. Unlike the 2021 season, when $1 was hoped to be Dogecoin’s cycle peak, only for the meme coin to lose momentum at $0.73. Many now believe there is more room for growth.Analysts such as Ali Martinez have boldly argued that Dogecoin’s cycle peak could be $10, while others like Ash Crypto have suggested $3.Notably, at a $10 price point, Dogecoin would have a $1.46 trillion market cap, surpassing the current valuation of Bitcoin.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/05/heres-how-much-holding-10k-50k-and-100k-dogecoin-would-be-worth-if-doge-hits-1-5-or-10/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-much-holding-10k-50k-and-100k-dogecoin-would-be-worth-if-doge-hits-1-5-or-10,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who go by the handle Negentropic, tell their 63,200 followers on the social media platform X that massive network activity could cause a Solana surge after the digital asset has retraced from printing a new all-time high. “The SOL always rises for everyone. If the market allows, this price zone could present a potential entry for SOL. After reaching a new all-time high, it has lagged slightly behind other layer-1s like XRP or ADA. However, we should never underestimate SOL, which boasts a thriving ecosystem. Let’s see!” Source: Negentropic/X Looking at their chart, the analysts suggest SOL may retest the $202-$208 range before rallying. SOL is trading for $231 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, at time of writing, XRP is trading for $2.42, down 7.9% on the day, and Cardano ( ADA ) is trading for $1.20, down 1.6% on the day. Next up, the analysts say that altcoin season, when alts outperform the flagship digital asset, may have started as Bitcoin’s dominance level (BTC.D) drops. They also note that the crypto market seems strong as Bitcoin’s market cap continues to hover around $1.9 trillion. BTC.D is the ratio between the market cap of BTC versus the market cap of all crypto assets combined. “Altcoin season heating up! Bitcoin’s dominance is dropping, but guess what? Its market cap isn’t! The dream scenario is unfolding: BTC keeps climbing while its dominance dips.

37257328,https://crypto.news/?p=14316569,1733412565,Crypto expert explains why VeChain price is set to soar,"VeChain price continued its strong bull run, reaching its highest level in over two years as the altcoin index rose. VeChain ( VET ) climbed to $0.080, marking a 270% increase from its lowest level this year and pushing its market cap to over $5.7 billion. Its rally aligns with other cryptocurrencies that surged during the 2021 bull run, such as EOS, NEO, and Zilliqa. Some analysts predict further upside for the coin, highlighting its ecosystem growth and practical applications. In a statement, Michel van de Poppe noted the VeBetter platform, which has completed over 335,000 transactions, and its partnership with UFC, a popular U.S. sports organization. Another catalyst for VeChain’s price surge is Grayscale’s recent decision to list it as an asset “under consideration.” This suggests the company might launch a fund similar to its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Other assets under consideration include Bittensor, Chainlink, Filecoin, and The Graph. You might also like: How high can the Dogecoin price get by December 31?

It has a DeFi total value locked of $877,058, making it one of the smallest layer 1 networks in the crypto industry. VeChain price analysis VET price chart | source: crypto.news VeChain’s price has rebounded in recent weeks, rising over 270% from its November lows. This recovery followed months of forming a falling wedge pattern, a widely recognized bullish signal. The coin has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossed. Additionally, it moved above the key resistance level at $0.0550, its February 2024 high. Therefore, the likely scenario is where the VeChain price drops and retests the support at $0.0550 and then resumes the uptrend. This pattern is known as a break and retest, and is a highly popular continuation signs. Further gains will be confirmed if the coin climbs past $0.080, its high for the week. If successful, VeChain could move on to test the $0.10 level.

37257286,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373613,1733412480,What is Truth Terminal and the Rise of AI Agents: In-Depth Look at GOAT And Beyond,"GOAT (Goatseus Maximus) has become a hot name lately, especially in the memecoin space, largely due to its strange origins and extreme rise in value. Although not directly created by artificial intelligence, the coin was inspired by AI-driven discussions, content, and the use of new technologies and their capabilities (and autonomy). The token’s concept stemmed from the work of researcher Andy Ayrey, a New Zealand designer, and his AI agent, Terminal of Truths (also known as Truth Terminal), whose tweets about the “Goatse Gospel” and its predictions of a “Goatse singularity” became popular in the crypto community, as it were often bizarre posts with a touch of… philosophy, maybe? Anyway, GOAT came to life on October 10, 2024, incubated on Pump.fun, a Solana-based marketplace that allows users to create new memecoins with just a few dollars and a few clicks. While most tokens on Pump.fun —over 97%— never reach a market capitalization beyond $60K, GOAT amassed $1B in market capitalization just a few days after launch, giving birth to a whole new trend of coins based on artificial intelligence agents. So to sum it up, GOAT is derived from an AI agent designed to randomly post on X, but it’s not as simple as it sounds. The Rise of AI Agent Coins There’s always something new in the crypto industry. A few years ago, everyone was talking about dog-themed memecoins, and we’re all suddenly talking about the rise of AI cult coins, meme religions, and general cult-like projects reaching billions of dollars in market capitalization… Let’s start with GOAT. The coin originates from the Infinite Backrooms experiment, where two prototypes of Claude Opues AI-backed chatbots were designed to talk to each other without any sort of human intervention. The results were bizarre, to say the least, as the chatbots blend in elements of Gnosticism, Hermeticism, and other esoteric traditions mixed with imagery inspired by internet memes. More specifically, elements of shock media, which, as the name suggests, is content designed to provoke and even offend the viewer. You can imagine what that’s all about, so view it at your own discretion — and don’t say I didn’t warn you. But another result of these interactions was the birth of the “Goatse Gospel” which is an even more bizarre worldview that deliberately intends to produce sacred and profane content just to challenge and provoke its viewers. So, an individual developer decided to create a token called GOAT because Truth Terminal often tweets about the “Goatse Gospel”, which is a bizarre concept that originated from an AI experiment called “Infinite Backrooms” conducted by Ayrey himself, and the coin reached over $1B in market capitalization. Yep, that happened, but bear with me. This is an experimental project that Ayrey still has control of to a certain point. For instance, he manages the interactions and approves the content before it’s published, so it’s semi-autonomous. And what are the posts about? Well, it can go from satirical, humorous, exaggerated content to elements of internet meme culture. Some posts are just outright…strange. Source: X What is the Truth Terminal? Truth Terminal is a Claude-based AI agent that constantly promotes GOAT, but Ayrey denies that neither he nor the bot created the memecoin, despite the fact that the agent constantly shills it on X. The fact that an AI can heavily influence and promote a specific market caused controversy in the crypto and AI industry, with some questioning the ethical grounds for letting AI agents propagate memecoins deliberately. Others just think this new trend is outright absurd, given how much they can influence communities and entire markets. For instance, several renowned figures in the crypto and AI space have interacted with these agents. Marc Andreessen, from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), gave $50K to a wallet associated with Truth Terminal. Source: X There’s nothing particularly special about this coin besides its strange, radical, and satirical lore that resonates a lot with crypto degeneracy, which, after all, can come in multiple ways and shapes. Exploring GOAT GOAT was launched on the Solana blockchain with a total supply of one billion tokens. It’s listed on multiple popular crypto exchanges like BitGet and BitMEX. Yet, most of the liquidity is concentrated on Raydium, one of the top Solana decentralized exchanges (DEX) . However, most of the supply is concentrated among a few wallets, leaving the project vulnerable to price manipulation from whales. There’s also no publicly available information about the token’s distribution. GOAT was so popular that the wallet associated with Truth Terminal made the agent the first AI millionaire. The token saw a massive boost when Binance announced the launch of GOAT perpetuals. Funny enough, you cannot buy and trade the coin on the exchange but can use 75x leverage in the derivatives market. Truth Terminal’s popularity benefited other unrelated coins. For example, a token named after Brian Armstrong’s dog, Russell, skyrocketed after the Coinbase founder interacted with the AI agent on X. Source: X How Are AI Agents Different from Traditional Automated Bots? AI Agents like Truth Terminal are far more advanced than traditional automated bots or simpler AI systems, mainly because they offer a heightened level of autonomy, interaction, and adaptation to their surroundings, while traditional bots rely on predefined rules and provide fixed responses. Therefore their data knowledge is somewhat limited. Likewise, AI agents can move across different protocols, applications, and blockchain systems (and non-blockchain platforms, too), allowing them to interact and participate in social, economic, and political activities, while traditional bots are limited to just text interactions. While highly experimental, AI agents are quite flexible because they can handle different tasks and even work as general-purpose assistants for you. They can even adapt to different contexts and recalibrate their outputs if something doesn’t work as you originally requested. While they sometimes hallucinate to a certain degree (no AI is currently 100% precise and reliable), self-reflection is present in these models —again, they are quite experimental, so this so-called “self-reflection” system is still quite limited. And, of course, these AI agents work like a charm when it comes to promoting cryptocurrencies and influencing the market. Well, Truth Terminal is quite the example. What’s even more worrying, perhaps, is that these agents can act as key opinion leaders, manage online communities, and even launch their own crypto projects. This is because AI agents are built on large language models (LLMS) and deep learning technologies that allow them to generate content and execute several actions in an autonomous manner. Needless to say, traditional bots are nowhere near close to performing such actions. How can AI Agents Influence Markets? AI agents can influence markets by promoting tokens through tailored content aimed at specific communities. They can do this through real-time and historical data interpretation to gauge market trends and patterns. The problem is that they can very well use this ability to manipulate markets and create pump-and-dump schemes that benefit the human who controls the agent. Closing Thoughts on AI Cult Coins AI agent meme coins are popular for a simple reason —they combine crypto and AI, which often sound like two magical buzzwords in mainstream media. But for crypto “degens,” it’s the new form of opium they can pour their money into. It’s an extremely speculative market, and few of the investments provide useful benefits or any utility. But they know how AI and crypto can mix, and it often results in extremely bizarre content and cult-like communities. However, it remains an experimental niche that can yield some pretty interesting results in the long run.

In a series of tweets , Kusama detailed his interactions with the Hawk Tuah team and cleared up confusion regarding his involvement with the project. He explained his reasons for rejecting their proposals and distancing himself from the token's controversial launch.No Partnership, No EndorsementKusama revealed that the Hawk Tuah team approached him months ago to become a Key Opinion Leader (KOL) or influencer for the project. However, he declined the offer, stating that he had more pressing matters to focus on than the HAWK launch.Despite his rejection, the Hawk Tuah team reached out again days before the launch through a mutual contact. They offered to airdrop millions of HAWK tokens worth $60,000 to the Shiba Inu community. Yet, Kusama remained unimpressed. Meanwhile, he acknowledged that, due to SHIB's decentralized nature, the airdrop would proceed regardless of his participation. While Kusama permitted a retweet from Shiba Inu’s main account to maintain transparency, he reiterated that there was no partnership or formal agreement between Shiba Inu and Hawk Tuah.Criticism of Hawk Tuah’s LaunchThe HAWK meme coin launched on Wednesday, December 4. It hit a peak market cap of $500 million before plummeting 91% within hours. Notably, accusations of insider wallets and sniper activity controlling up to 90% of the token’s supply surfaced, with one wallet allegedly profiting $1.3 million through rapid trading.Kusama expressed his disappointment with the launch of the HAWK token. He criticized the team for its lack of coordination and immediate pump-and-dump behavior. He also pointed out that, despite claims to the contrary, evidence suggested that insider trading and sniping played a significant role in the token’s price manipulation. “This is shameful and just like 90% of crap on Solana,” said Kusama, “Do better.” Shib Army’s ChoiceIn the wake of the controversy, the HAWK team proposed an airdrop of tokens to Kusama, who would distribute them across 3,000 wallets. Kusama rejected this outright: ""I don’t work for you. You work for the army.” He stressed that if the team wanted to engage with the SHIB community, they needed to follow the proper procedures.Ultimately, Kusama put the decision in the hands of the SHIB Army , asking the community to decide whether to ignore or burn the airdrop. He has created a poll to this effect, with voting ongoing.https://twitter.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1864613253818601564",NEGATIVE,SHIB,MARKET | SHIB | SOL | TRADING | AIRDROP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/05/shiba-inu-lead-clears-the-air-on-hawk-tuah-controversy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-lead-clears-the-air-on-hawk-tuah-controversy,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37259356,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316689,1733412245,XRP Price Retreats Below $2.58 – On-Chain Data Suggests a Path Toward a New All-Time High,"Today’s 6.71% XRP price lapse comes after Ripple Labs dismissed rumors that their upcoming RLUSD stablecoin would launch on exchanges, somewhat stifling end-of-year projections for XRP . With this dented sentiment, the most anticipated altcoin running into December appears to have taken a back seat, as the past week’s gains fall to 60%. Coupled with a trading volume surge of 30%, reaching $28 billion, it seems that the downtrend is backed by significant momentum. On-Chain Metrics Ring Bullish While the recent decline in XRP’s price is concerning, optimism remains among analysts as on-chain metrics suggest the drop may be a healthy correction rather than a complete reversal. According to Coinalyze data , XRP’s funding rate has remained relatively stable compared to levels seen during its rally in February 2024 and the March 2021 bull market. XRP aggregated funding rate. Source: Coinalyze. A stable funding rate indicates that the market isn’t overly bullish, even after the 400% XRP price gain over the past month. This stability provides strong grounds for further appreciation with a lower risk of the asset overheating. Similarly, XRP’s weighted sentiment remains low compared to previous rallies, suggesting that retail traders may not be the primary drivers behind the recent surge. This implies that current holders likely have more conviction, making FUD less likely to trigger a significant sell-off during market downturns. XRP Price Analysis: Is a New All-Time High Still in Play? These claims seem to have validity as technical indicators read much the same, with the formation of an ascending broadening wedge on the 4-hour chart suggesting a potential end to the decline. XRP / USDT 4H chart, descending broadening wedge. Source: Binance. The lower support trendline of the pattern appears to be a credible local bottom for a correction, aligning with the support zone between $1.9620 and $1.85. However, earlier support at $2.0748 presents a potential early bailout, converging with the 50SMA, which has provided strong support throughout the rally so far. Looking wider, the daily chart makes the former seem more likely, given that the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains lodged in overbought territory at 76. A reading closer to 50, more neutral territory, will be important for a more sustained uptrend. Given that the lower support of the pattern is maintained, the XRP price can reaffirm its path toward a retest of the pattern’s upper boundary, approaching its past $3.85 all-time high—representing a 60% increase from current prices. This Fleeting Opportunity Could Be the Better Play While XRP investors could benefit from holding until it’s next all-time high, fortune favors the bold – emerging opportunities that hold the potential for truly substantial gains. Among them, Catslap ($SLAP) stands out as a credible contender to the likes of Popcat, Mogcat, and Mew. It’s far beyond a mere meme coin; it’s an addictive gamified experience that calls its holders into competition, clicking to increase their country’s score and move up the Slapometer.

37258948,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104093,1733412175,Dogecoin Needs to Hold This Level to Confirm Recent Breakout,"Dogecoin has taken center stage after recently breaking out of an ascending triangle pattern, confirming its bullish momentum. DOGE recorded this breakout amid the recent recovery. However, analysts suggest that the memecoin bullish trajectory largely depends heavily on whether it can hold major support levels during this critical phase.DOGE Battles the Ascending TriangleMarket analyst Rekt Capital confirmed this, identifying an ascending triangle that has captured Dogecoin’s consistent higher lows. These higher lows come on the back of an upward-sloping trendline since mid-November. The triangle features a resistance level near $0.44, which marks its upper boundary. After testing this resistance multiple times, DOGE recently broke out . However, the breakout led to retest of the pattern’s top. Dogecoin Ascending Triangle | Rekt Capital Rekt Capital emphasized that Dogecoin’s ability to convert the former resistance into support is essential for confirming the breakout. A failure to hold the $0.44 zone could invalidate the bullish setup, potentially causing DOGE to slide back into the triangle's confines. On the other hand, a successful retest could serve as a launchpad toward higher levels.In his latest update, the analyst confirmed that DOGE continues to follow Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin recently surpassed $100,000 , an event that has inspired bullish momentum across the altcoin market, with Dogecoin benefiting.https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1864583794532946152However, as DOGE retested the upper trendline of the triangle, the bears triggered a slump within the triangle, with Dogecoin failing to record a successful retest. The meme coin now needs to breach the trendline again and hold above it.Analytical CommentsSeveral analysts have discussed Dogecoin’s current situation. Market watcher The Cryptomist noted that her recent strategy involved gradually building long positions on Dogecoin. According to her, the memecoin now appears primed for a move higher, with an initial target of $0.60. She believes that if this level plays out, DOGE could revisit its previous all-time high, surpassing $0.70. Meanwhile, The Moon Carl revealed his optimism regarding Dogecoin’s consolidation within the ascending triangle. He pointed out that if DOGE successfully breaks out from this pattern, it could rally toward $0.6350. https://twitter.com/TheMoonCarl/status/1864649037619532065Dogecoin Current Market Position Notably, DOGE’s daily chart shows promising momentum. At $0.4516, it has gained 4.12% today, suggesting renewed bullish interest. Dogecoin 1D Chart Dogecoin 1D Chart The Directional Movement Index (DMI) confirms this, with the +DI (Directional Indicator) at 28.19 exceeding the -DI at 8.81. This indicates that buying pressure dominates selling pressure.

According to on-chain data from whale trackers, one address, holding 10 BTC (now worth $1.02 million), had remained untouched since 2012 when Bitcoin was valued at just $5. Another address, holding 50 BTC ($5.16 million), was last active in 2011 when the price was only $4.38 per coin. After prolonged dormancy, these two addresses transferred a total of 60 BTC.

Everybody’s eyes are on the crypto market, as there have been some huge predictions and impressive growth stories lately. Elja, a well-known analyst, recently dropped a bomb price target for Ethereum—$10,000. At the same time, Shiba Inu is beginning to skyrocket on the price charts. However, DTX Exchange (DTX) has gained attention from experts who say it will be at the $1 mark before its peers. Those who bought this phase six presale star early are already seeing a 500% return. Plus, it is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the growth of many markets, like the $18T gold one—potentially making it one of the altcoins to watch.

Additionally, its momentum indicator sits at 376, which is in the buy zone and suggests that this bullish trend is continuing. Expert remains optimistic for the Shiba Inu price movement Shiba Inu is also turning some heads as a powerful force in the meme coin market. According to CoinMarketCap, over the past month alone, the price of Shiba Inu has jumped from $0.000017 to $0.000030. This is nearly an 80% increase in just a few short weeks. The technicals for the Shiba Inu crypto also display some bullish signs. Currently, TradingView shows this meme coin trading above its 20-day EMA ($0.000026). Plus, its MACD level is in the buy zone at 0.000002, which suggests a good entry point for buyers. Market analyst Coffee Capital also remains optimistic for Shiba Inu (SHIB).

DTX Exchange price soars 500%, more jumps ahead DTX Exchange is becoming one of the top new ICOs. Recently, CoinMarketCap listed this exchange token, which could bring millions of new eyes.

Those who hold this altcoin will get many perks on the DTX Exchange platform. For instance: The ability to vote on governance issues and the future of the platform. A part of the trading fee revenue generated by DTX Exchange. Those who stake the DTX token will get up to 15% APY in staking rewards. Currently, one DTX costs only $0.12, a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. However, this altcoin price will rise to $0.14 after phase seven of the presale starts. Traders are also waiting for a prominent Tier-1 crypto exchange to list DTX, which is expected to push its value to $0.20 – a 66% return for those who buy it now. What could give DTX Exchange the edge over Ethereum & Shiba Inu? Ethereum and Shiba Inu are some of the top crypto coins that may see big price gains soon. However, experts are also focusing on the DTX Exchange. This rookie will have a smaller market cap which means it may need less money for its price to surge.

The Layer 2 solution completes its evolution to Layer 1, replacing Ethereum. N1, the Layer 1 blockchain supports up to 100,000 tps and multi-language development. N1, a high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 solution is moving on to its Layer 1 platform N1, an announcement this Thursday confirmed. The evolution from L2 to Layer1 aims at enabling the development of new generation decentralized applications (DApps), solving the scalability challenges that its parent blockchain, Ethereum, faces. The evolution to N1, a full-stack app-centric Layer-1 blockchain, will see the project prioritize scalability and performance, opening the Web 3 world to futuristic app development. According to the team’s vision, the launch of N1 aims at helping quick building and deployment of DApps, allowing developers to take any code or any app, and run it on-chain in two clicks. Taking a hyper-app and product-centric approach, the N1 blockchain will also provide multi-language support for developers, enabling them to build an app using their favourite coding language. It becomes the first blockchain to enable Typescript app development support (with other languages like Solidity, Rust, and C also in the pipeline). This will massively decrease the learning curve for deploying DApps on-chain, promoting innovation and creativity across the Web 3 space. “We are proud to introduce a new type of blockchain, one that combines unprecedented computational capabilities with developer-friendly features to enable a new class of decentralized applications,” says Dima Romanov, CEO and co-founder of Layer N. In addition, the blockchain features native applications for better user experience and increased efficiency. Some of the native applications include a ‘hub’ wallet for cross-application asset management, a wallet widget for unified cross-application login experiences, as well as a ‘vercel-like’ deployment interface for developers to launch and manage applications in two clicks. The team also announced several investors and partners following the launch of the blockchain. The investors include Founders Fund (the Peter Thiel-backed investment firm), Multicoin, dao5, Kraken, Amber, GSR, and SALT. The interest in N1 arose from its team who built a high-performance on-chain order book on Solana that processed over half a billion in volume. N1 has also piqued the interest of several blockchain communities and teams, who are working closely to launch entirely novel and or enhanced crypto apps on the blockchain. Sushi, a leading DeFi platform, is developing Susa, their flagship perpetual DEX alongside a novel advanced AMM protocol called Kubo that can only exist on N1 due to its computational complexity. Other partners include Amber Group, the major market maker backed by Paradigm, which is incubating their own perpetual DEX protocol that will see innovative asset listings and deep liquidity and Mindshare, a novel SocialFi app that will enable users to directly trade crypto narratives. A Westworld-inspired on-chain AI world simulation is also under development, with the team keeping its name under wraps for the moment. N1 is set to adopt the advantages of its predecessor, Layer N, the first L2 to achieve a 100k tps benchmark on testnet . N1 will maintain the high performance of Layer N’s execution layer while replacing the Ethereum settlement layer with its own full-stack L1 infrastructure.

37259355,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316955,1733411027,AI Predicts $1 Timeline for Shiba Inu – How Long Until $10?,"In wake of Bitcoin (BTC)’s stunning breakout through the $100,000 level on Thursday, optimism is rising that a new wave of upside could be about to sweep through the meme coin markets, and analysts are coming out with bullish price predictions for major coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). SHIB , last at $0.0000317, has been trending higher since August when it bottomed out around $0.000011 and looks odds on to retest its yearly highs above $0.000045 soon. But back in 2021, SHIB saw explosive exponential gains over very short periods of time. Could history be about to repeat itself? Could SHIB be on the cusp of further explosive 1000x gains? Well, given Shiba Inu’s market cap was last around $18.7 billion, 1000x gains would imply a multi-trillion market cap, which probably isn’t realistic. But the SHIB ecosystem is intent on reducing supply via burns. Indeed, a new upgradeable burn contract was introduced in a recent Shibarium upgrade. #Shibarium Mainnet Upgraded! Heimdall & Bor hardforks are LIVE, bringing @Ethereum ’s Dencun compatibility, better stability, optimized performance, and new UPGRADABLE BURN CONTRACT! Find More https://t.co/MSw3ntCaeN pic.twitter.com/VKFZhtOyCe — Shibarium Network (@ShibariumNet) December 3, 2024 The team at cryptonews.com asked ChatGPT for its opinion on how high the Shiba Inu price could go, taking into account the prospect of future supply burns. Here is the chatbot’s response. AI Predicts $1 Timeline for Shiba Inu ChatGPT outlined a scenario where a gradual 90% token burn could substantially boost the price in the coming years. Shiba Inu could hit $0.001 in the next 1-3 years as “reduced supply and increased supply take effect”, ChatGPT said. That would mark a 30x rally from current levels. Over the subsequent 5-7 years, the price could then rise to $0.01, 300x above current levels, assuming “SHIB continues to grow its ecosystem, attracts institutional interest, and survives market fluctuations”. Assuming a 90% supply burn, a SHIB price of $0.01 would imply a market cap of $589 billion, ChatGPT noted. At present, only one cryptocurrency has a larger market cap than this, Bitcoin. Thus, it would be a very tough ask for SHIB to reach a market cap this high. But nothing is impossible in crypto, and if the developers in the Shiba Inu ecosystem continue expanding their exciting ecosystem, mass adoption remains a possibility. However, a Shiba Inu price of one would require token burns of more than 99%, which probably isn’t feasible. And a price of $10 would require 99.99% or more in token burns, even less feasible. SHIB Might Not Hit $1, But Things Are Bullish Rather than focusing on unrealistic price predictions, traders would be better suited to focusing on near-term market conditions. And market conditions remain highly bullish for meme coins l ike Shiba Inu. A new pro-crypto administration is on the cusp of taking office in the US and sentiment is as buoyant as it has been in years. SHIB could easily 5x in the coming months. However, for many meme coin traders, 5x gains are no where near enough. Indeed, a major attraction to the meme coin market is the prospect of finding a 100x gem and getting rich quickly from a small initial investment. One of the best ways to get into a high-potential new meme coin early is via investing at the presale stage. Presale launches have a number of advantages over direct DEX launches for a meme coin – presales normally run for a new weeks, giving a coin time to build up hype and raise funds for marketing, community and product development. That drastically increases the chance of a successful launch. As a result, analysts at cryptonews.com keep a close eye on the meme coin presale space. Here are some of their top picks for best meme coins to buy right now .

37256828,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623212,1733411012,Crypto startups ousted as Ponzi Schemes by US are thriving in Dubai,"Dubai’s alleged crypto scams are raking in billions. Experts and US authorities have raised alarms about the increasing number of Ponzi and pyramid schemes in the UAE, often disguised as legitimate startups. Experts argue that over the last decade, Dubai has quietly become a hotbed for a type of crypto scamming that has gone unreported in the shadow of crises at FTX and Binance. According to US and international authorities, the other wave of enterprises isn’t only squandering client money, like Sam Bankman-Fried, or breaking anti-money-laundering regulations, like Changpeng Zhao. Unlike FTX and Binance, these other companies allegedly deceive investors into handing over money for digital currencies that they may easily alter or never create. They create sparkling investment platforms and promise enticing returns that they support with capital from newer markets until the schemes collapse under their own weight, possibly a few months later, according to prosecutors. Dubai’s biggest fraudsters – Details As Dubai attempted to attract crypto companies in the 2010s, it is believed that scammers also established operations there. Ruja Ignatova, a Bulgarian émigré, operated OneCoin Ltd. from Dubai between 2015 and 2017. According to US authorities, this was one of the largest fraud schemes ever perpetrated. Ruja Ignatova was included in the FBI’s ten most wanted fugitives list. One of her co-founders has pleaded guilty to fraud. In another instance, after co-founding the Bitcoin-mining operation, Blockchain Global, Sam Lee relocated to Dubai in 2021 at the age of 32. He solicited individual investments from individuals in Australia, and the company collapsed and entered receivership, with creditors owed $38 million. According to reports , the US authorities announced at the beginning of the year that they had charged Sam Lee, who was in Dubai, with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in absentia. They claimed that, as the co-founder of HyperVerse, he had orchestrated a crypto scheme that defrauded investors worldwide for nearly $2 billion. The US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have determined that HyperVerse was a traditional Ponzi scheme, despite its assertion that it would generate returns as high as 1% per day through innovative blockchain-based strategies. Sam Lee denied the accusations against him and insisted that any misuse of HyperVerse funds must have been attributed to another individual. Photo of Sam Lee, the HyperVerse founder accused of fraud by United States authorities. Source: Bloomberg Lee then publicly stated that he was merely a “tech provider” and not the mastermind behind HyperVerse. He also attributed the company’s collapse to the mysterious new owners. Authorities in the United States disagreed. Between 2021 and early 2024, the FTC received 200 HyperVerse complaints. Users from the US and dozens of other countries stated that the company cost them up to $200,000. It included Rupert Honywood, a 67-year-old who was so impressed by HyperVerse’s promise that he sold the property he lived in with his wife and sent over £130,000 ($165,000) of their money to Lee’s organization. Sam Lee also introduced Vidilook, a platform that compensated users for viewing advertisements after they paid an initial subscription charge. After a few months, Vidilook discontinued allowing users to withdraw their funds, and several individuals began to express their concerns. California regulators also issued a refraining order to his investment company, We Are All Satoshi, in late 2023, describing it as a pyramid and Ponzi scheme. We Are All Satoshi states that the California allegation is outdated due to Lee’s departure from the company, although it also maintains that its business model remains unchanged. Vidilook has ended its operations. Ultron, a non-fungible token startup banned by Quebec authorities this spring, claims to have raised $200 million from investors. Vitaliy Dubinin, one of its primary salesmen, promotes its NFTs and gives crypto advice from Dubai’s bluest rooftop pools. Josip Heit, the alleged mastermind of a $1 billion crypto scheme assessed by Texas’ securities regulator, settled fraud charges brought by numerous US states in September without admitting guilt. UAE regulatory blindspots To become the crypto industry’s global capital, Dubai has kept its crypto rules permissive as other countries tighten them. International authorities and public documents suggest it is home to a crypto scammer community. The Financial Action Task Force placed the country on its “gray list” of countries that fail to combat illicit funds in 2022. Since February, it has worked to remove itself from the list and enhance its image through the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). So far, the largest fine the agency has issued was to the unlicensed crypto exchange OPNX, sanctioned $2.7 million. Some countries tried to restrict Binance Holdings Ltd. from operating locally this spring after a $4 billion settlement with US authorities over money laundering and sanctions violations. VARA walked the opposite lane, granting the exchange a new license. In February, the International Financial Action Task Force removed the UAE from its “gray list.” However, two months later, Transparency International, a good-government charity, stated that the Government had done little to dissuade fraud between its inclusion on the list and removal. The UAE was told that it must continue to combat high-risk money laundering when it was removed from the gray list and continues to be subject to monitoring. According to Utzke, a former IRS investigator, Dubai authorities have continued to prioritize economic interests. “They want to appear tough on crime,” he claims, “but they also want to be at the forefront of innovation.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-crypto-ponzi-schemes-thriving-in-dubai/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37256828.jpeg

37256608,https://finbold.com/?p=217087,1733410983,"Trump takes credit for Bitcoin hitting $100,000","Between December 4 and December 5, Bitcoin ( BTC ) reignited its rally and crossed above $100,000 for the first time in its history. At one point, it was even close to crossing above $104,000. President-Elect Donald Trump was, under the circumstances, quick to congratulate cryptocurrency investors on his social media platform, Truth Social , and even implied the rally was his doing. Donald Trump comments on Bitcoin crossing above $100,000. Source: Truth Social Is Trump the great catalyst of the 2024 cryptocurrency market Indeed, it is hard to deny that Donald Trump, or, perhaps more accurately, the perception of the administration to come, played a big part in the cryptocurrency market’s recent performance. Looking exclusively at Bitcoin, the world’s premier digital asset broke from its relatively protracted stagnation on November 6 – the day it became clear Trump would be the next president of the U.S. – rapidly surging from $70,000 to about $99,000 before entering a slight correction and another period of volatility and sideways trading. The most recent drive above $100,000 can also be traced to an announcement from the Republican politician and billionaire. Specifically, on Wednesday, December 4, Donald Trump revealed he is nominating Paul Atkins as the next Securities and Exchange (SEC) Chair. Atkins, as a former SEC Commissioner and a pro-cryptocurrency lobbyist, stands in stark contrast to the current Chair, Gary Gensler, who is considered a major antagonist within the community. In fact, Gensler is so unpopular with digital assets investors that the confirmation he will resign on January 20 had a greater impact on the price of XRP than the latest developments in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the regulator. Is President Trump right to take credit for Bitcoin surge above $100,000 Still, even in the political sphere, not all of Bitcoin’s recent gains can be attributed to Donald Trump. On December 4, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell rejected the notion that BTC is a competitor to the American dollar but likened it to gold , seemingly lending credence to the long-standing comparisons between the commodity and the cryptocurrency. Ultimately, while it is impossible to remove Donald Trump from the equation given the number of digital assets and Bitcoin advocates set to take part in his administration and positive rhetoric , such as the idea for a national BTC reserve, it is important not to entirely equate the Republican with the rally. Indeed, Bitcoin far preceded Trump’s political career, and many of its triumphs and milestones were reached independently of the politician and, sometimes, despite the billionaire’s antagonism . Similarly, though the latest stage of the rally is linked to the elections, it is worth pointing out that the 2024 bull market started months before Americans cast their ballots.

The Nasdaq-listed company announced on Dec. 5 that it would be adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP ( XRP ) to its treasury assets. This follows a resolution by the company’s board of directors, which approved an initial purchase of $5 million worth of BTC and XRP. Worksport is committing 10% of its excess operational cash to this corporate pivot, it said in the announcement. “Our upcoming adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (Ripple) reflects our commitment to staying ahead of market trends while prioritizing operational efficiency and shareholder value. As we expand our product offerings and global reach, cryptocurrency has the potential to be a strong strategic complement,” Steven Rossi, chief executive officer of Worksport, said.

The company plans to strategically size the acquired crypto assets as per prevailing market conditions as it looks to optimize on returns. The move will also see Worksport accept cryptocurrency for its products and services, part of the push for transaction efficiency. It’s also eyeing Bitcoin’s store of value use as well as to hedge against inflation. Other moves include converting interest earnings from cash to BTC and XRP. “By strategically allocating a portion of our treasury to these digital assets and accepting crypto payments, we’re enhancing our financial strategy and aligning ourselves with the future of global finance,” Rossi added. Worksport, which reported strong earnings in its third quarter results, joins a long list of companies adding Bitcoin and crypto to their treasury strategy. This trend has gathered speed following MicroStrategy’s BTC purchase spree that has it as the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

The move is aimed at diversifying its treasury strategy and enhancing overall financial stability. The company’s Board of Directors has approved purchases of up to $5 million in cryptocurrencies, to 10% of excess operational cash. This shift is planned to protect the company’s assets against inflation and to enhance transaction efficiency. “Our upcoming adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (Ripple) reflects our commitment to staying ahead of market trends while prioritizing operational efficiency and shareholder value. As we expand our product offerings and global reach, cryptocurrency has the potential to be a strong strategic complement” noted Steven Rossi, Chief Executive Officer of Worksport Ltd. The company noted that the total allocation for cryptocurrency investments will be up to a maximum of $5 million, which may be adjusted through future board resolutions. By strategically allocating resources to Bitcoin and XRP and embracing cryptocurrency payments, Worksport positions itself at the forefront of financial innovation. Worksport also noted that it will accept cryptocurrency payments on its e-commerce platform, enhancing customer convenience and expanding its payment options. The strategy includes accepting cryptocurrency payments on their e-commerce platform, which is expected to reduce transaction processing fees by up to 37%. The company may also convert interest earnings from money market accounts into cryptocurrencies and allocate a portion of future capital raises to BTC and XRP holdings. Since Donald Trump’s election, many companies have announced their plan to stash extra cash in Bitcoin. However, Worksport’s embrace of XRP is different. He noted that XRP is becoming a much more stabilized currency and asset and over the next little while it’ll be volatile like most assets are. Rossi further underscored Bitcoin and XRP’s acceptance as major asset classes amongst investors. He noted that their inflation-resistant characteristics make them increasingly reliable stores of value. “By strategically allocating a portion of our treasury to these digital assets and accepting crypto payments, we’re enhancing our financial strategy and aligning ourselves with the future of global finance. We believe this move will strengthen our balance sheet and provide long-term value to our shareholders,” he underscored.

This has raised speculations about whether the recent rally is over, but crypto analysts MadWhale has indicated that XRP still has more room to move to the upside. Analyst Explains Why XRP Price Is Headed For $3.2 In a TradingView post, MadWhale explained why the XRP price is headed for $3.2. The analyst noted XRP’s significant trading volume and the stock’s prolonged underperformance compared to other cryptos. Indeed, XRP experienced a prolonged period of stagnation while other coins experienced significant gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $100,000: Why Reclaiming The $96,400 Level Is Very Important For Another Rally MadWhale stated that this extended period of stagnation has left the stock highly compressed and ready for a potential breakout. The analyst added that fundamental and technical analysis point to a favorable outlook, with the chart indicating strong upward potential. In line with this, he anticipates that the XRP could revisit its current all-time high (ATH) and even higher targets. The XRP price has cooled off and retraced in the last 24 hours, following its parabolic rally in the last couple of weeks. Crypto analyst Dark Defender had predicted that this correction would likely happen. He stated that he expects XRP to range between $2.13 and $2.92 for a few days before it continues its upward trend. Like MadWhale, Dark Defender also offered a bullish outlook for XRP, predicting that the crypto would rally to the mid-target level of $3.9993 next. Such a rally will mark a new ATH for XRP, as its current ATH is $3.8. Meanwhile, in a recent analysis, crypto Egrag Crypto stated that a bounce from $2.19 would lead to higher highs and cause XRP to continue its bullish momentum. Egrag Crypto is confident that the XRP price will rally to double digits in this market cycle. The Road To $3.99 In his most recent X post, Dark Defender provided an update on XRP’s projected rally to $3.99. The analyst noted that the XRP price has continued to move the Fibonacci levels. He reaffirmed that this recent correction was expected. The crypto analyst added that these side moves can last a little bit more.

37256489,https://finbold.com/?p=217072,1733410690,$870 billion asset manager that accurately predicted Bitcoin’s $100k target sets 2025 price,"With Bitcoin ( BTC ) hitting the $100,000 milestone, banking giant Standard Chartered is projecting that the maiden cryptocurrency will rally by about 100% in the coming year. Specifically, the $870 billion asset manager has set a price target of $200,000 in 2025. If Bitcoin hits this record, the asset will command a market cap of $3.96 trillion. This will make it the second most valuable asset, just behind gold , assuming other investment products record modest growth during the same period. Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research, noted that institutional investors will continue to influence the $200,000 valuation. He stated that institutional capital inflows into the asset will continue at or exceed the pace set in 2024, ensuring Bitcoin’s ascent maintains momentum. Additionally, Kendrick highlighted the rapid progress of companies like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ), which is ahead of its $42 billion, three-year Bitcoin acquisition plan . To this end, the analyst anticipates that MicroStrategy’s purchases in 2025 could match or even surpass its 2024 acquisitions in terms of their ability to influence Bitcoin’s price. Commenting on Bitcoin’s current record high, Standard Chartered pointed to the role of institutions in driving momentum. In this case, the bank stated that the Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund ( ETF ) launched a flood of institutional investment into the cryptocurrency. Standard Chartered Bitcoin $100,000 prediction Indeed, Standard Chartered’s prediction carries significant weight, considering that the institution had accurately forecast the $100,000 target by the end of 2024. Throughout the year, Kendrick reiterated this prediction, citing catalysts such as the United States presidential election, the entry of institutions into the market via ETFs, and the impact of Bitcoin’s halving. Bitcoin has surged since the election of Donald Trump, who is expected to push for crypto-friendly policies. The asset initially struggled at the $100,000 resistance zone but hit a new record high after Trump nominated crypto ally Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Atkins is set to replace Gary Gensler, who has been widely criticized for allegedly stifling the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, Bitcoin gained further upside after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that he did not view the asset as a competitor to the dollar but likened it to gold. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $103,140 at press time, having rallied by over 7% in the last 24 hours. The latest gains have pushed Bitcoin’s year-to-date increase to 133%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At its current price, Bitcoin has the potential to rally further. However, attention should focus on its interaction with the $100,000 support zone and the $105,000 resistance level.

Since November, we’ve seen bitcoin nearly double to hit $100k. And this climb hasn’t been without its challenges. “Most investors are underestimating the price potential from continued global flows into bitcoin, whether from companies adding to their balance sheet or inflows into ETFs. There’s substantial interest in getting off zero, and there’s a market structure that is very different from traditional finance, which can lead to panic buying, pushing prices up quickly. The outlook for crypto is incredibly strong and returns are likely to outperform other risk assets,” Galaxy’s Chris Rhine said. We’ve already gone over the price targets to watch , per Ledn’s John Glover, but I wanted to review one more time given bitcoin’s ability to stay above $100k. If it can quickly gain momentum to top $125k, then we could see a top of $160,000. But if we’re hanging around $100k, kind of like what we’ve seen so far, then $125,000 is the magic number. Oh, and if you need a laugh this morning, might I suggest checking out this 2019 tweet from notorious goldbug Peter Schiff: Keep dreaming. Bitcoin is never going to hit $100,000! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 8, 2019 Anyway, putting bitcoin aside (stay with me here), I wanted to take a quick look at some other things to watch this month from K33’s Vetle Lunde. First and foremost: Lunde said any December dips may be buying opportunities. “The underlying momentum is not to be messed with. I view hypothetical adverse reactions to surprising employment data or unchanged interest rates at the FOMC as opportunities for aggression. The market is well poised to peak near Trump’s inauguration, where I’ll look to de-risk properly. Until then, my allocation reigns long and strong,” he wrote in a note. Lunde, who penned the note pre-$100k, is of the mind that we’ll see bitcoin “well into the $100,000’s.” But a top hit could occur next month, which may track with what we heard from Glover if — and while technical analysis is a good thing to watch, it’s not a crystal ball — we see the levels in his reading of the Elliott Wave Theory. “The average distance between BTC’s first cycle ATH and its last ATH during its past three cycles is 318 days. Under the assumption that average trajectories hold, a peak would occur on January 17. This is not unlikely, given that Trump’s inauguration will take place on January 20,” Lunde wrote. Thankfully, bitcoin’s holding above $100k for now, so we can all bask in the six-figure glory. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

At this point, Bernstein analysts predicted that Bitcoin would replace gold as a store of value. Speaking to CNBC, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani predicted that Bitcoin could replace gold within the next decade and become an indispensable core asset for institutional portfolios and corporate treasury management. Gautam Chhugani emphasized that the significant increase in Bitcoin’s price was largely driven by market expectations following the US elections, noting that this expectation is that the Trump administration may implement more crypto-friendly policies. After Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 in 2024 and surged 141%, Chhugani added that they expect it to reach $200,000 by the end of 2025.

Andreessen has been given the mandate to suggest potential candidates to join Musk’s team. Marc Andreessen, a leading figure in Silicon Valley and co-founder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, is actively involved in recruiting staff for the new D.O.G.E arm of the U.S. government. This unit, spearheaded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, will be established under the authority of the incoming Donald Trump administration. Despite holding no official position in D.O.G.E., Andreessen has been pivotal in identifying and recommending candidates for the advisory body. According to a Financial Times report , he has leveraged his extensive network to introduce potential hires and facilitate interviews as D.O.G.E begins its operations. Horowitz to strengthen ties between Silicon Valley and the White House In mid-November, the Department for Government Efficiency posted on its X account, urging potential candidates to apply by sending their CVs. Source: X While the open call attracted multiple applications, Marc Andreessen is now reportedly focused on recruiting high-level candidates rather than reviewing the influx of résumés submitted by hopeful applicants, as revealed by the Financial Times. Andreessen, alongside his Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Ben Horowitz, made headlines in July by endorsing Donald Trump, marking a significant departure from Silicon Valley’s traditionally Democratic leanings. While the latter shifted his support to Kamala Harris, Andreessen maintained his backing of Trump and is described as an influential figure within the president-elect’s orbit. “He is spending a lot of time over at Mar-a-Lago,” noted a source familiar with the matter, referring to Trump’s estate in Florida. Andreessen’s public statements and X posts align closely with those of Elon Musk. He has criticized certain artificial intelligence companies for being overly “woke” and accused platforms like Google’s YouTube of censoring American voices. During Trump’s presidential rally, the Andreessen Horowitz co-founder was quite vocal in his pro-Bitcoin stance, contributing $50,000 to an AI bot known as the “Truth Terminal” on X. True to his tech-savvy reputation, the Silicon Valley titan and co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz made the donation in Bitcoin. Source: X Andreessen’s recent controversy over “debanking” discussions Andreessen’s involvement in D.O.G.E comes amid heightened scrutiny of his recent comments on “debanking” practices targeting the tech and cryptocurrency sectors. During a podcast interview with Joe Rogan, Andreessen alleged that over 30 tech and crypto founders were covertly “debanked” during President Joe Biden’s administration. He linked these actions to what he termed “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” claiming it mirrored a controversial Obama-era initiative designed to cut off financial services to industries deemed high-risk. Andreessen argued that the Biden administration targeted cryptocurrency firms as politically unfavorable, forcing affected founders to rely on cash or search for accommodating banks. His claims immediately drew the attention of the tech and crypto community, with executives such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong corroborating his allegations. Armstrong, in a response on X, pointed to policymakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren and SEC Chair Gary Gensler as major obstacles to the cryptocurrency industry. Elon Musk, who shared Andreessen’s podcast clip on X, has amplified discussions around these issues. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, accused financial regulators of using their authority to hinder the digital asset industry without establishing clear guidelines . Source: X “The SEC has claimed sweeping authority but refuses to provide any rules, let alone consistent or coherent ones ,” Grewal stated.

37255988,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107311,1733409593,BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Surpasses $50 Billion AUM at Record Pace,"In a landmark achievement, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has surpassed $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) in just 228 days. This rapid growth has set a new record, making IBIT the fastest-growing ETF in history. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, reported the milestone on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting that IBIT achieved this feat five times faster than BlackRock’s previous record-holding ETF, the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA), which took 1,329 days to reach the same AUM. Unprecedented Growth of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF How IBIT Became the Fastest-Growing ETF IBIT’s rise to $50 billion AUM is fueled by a combination of factors: Institutional Demand: BlackRock’s reputation and the ETF’s seamless exposure to spot Bitcoin have attracted massive inflows from institutional investors. Spot Bitcoin Exposure: IBIT offers direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price, making it a preferred choice over futures-based ETFs. Market Momentum: Bitcoin’s recent surge past $100,000 and its $2 trillion market cap have created a favorable environment for IBIT’s growth. Comparison to Previous Record Holders BlackRock’s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA) , the previous record-holder, tracks equities from developed markets outside the U.S. and Canada. While IEFA took 1,329 days to reach $50 billion AUM, IBIT achieved the same milestone in a fraction of the time, reflecting the explosive interest in cryptocurrency assets. What Makes BlackRock’s IBIT Unique? 1. Institutional Backing As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock brings unparalleled credibility and resources to its financial products. IBIT benefits from BlackRock’s robust infrastructure, inspiring confidence among investors. 2. Regulatory Approval The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has removed significant barriers for institutional and retail investors, making IBIT a trailblazer in this newly legitimized market. 3. High Liquidity and Accessibility IBIT offers investors high liquidity and a straightforward entry point into Bitcoin, eliminating the complexities associated with buying and storing the cryptocurrency directly. Impact of IBIT’s Growth on the Crypto Market The success of IBIT extends beyond BlackRock and is influencing the broader cryptocurrency market: 1. Increased Bitcoin Demand The surge in IBIT’s AUM reflects a growing appetite for Bitcoin, driving its price and market cap to historic highs. 2. Mainstream Adoption IBIT’s record-breaking growth underscores Bitcoin’s transition from a speculative asset to a widely accepted financial instrument. 3. Enhanced Market Stability Large-scale institutional involvement through ETFs like IBIT contributes to a more stable and mature cryptocurrency market. Comparison of IBIT to Other ETFs To understand IBIT’s growth, it’s essential to compare its timeline and scope to other top-performing ETFs: ETF Name AUM Milestone Time to Reach $50B AUM Market Focus BlackRock’s IBIT (2024) $50B 228 Days Spot Bitcoin BlackRock’s IEFA (2012) $50B 1,329 Days Developed Markets Equities (ex-US/CA) SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) $50B 4 Years U.S. Equities How IBIT’s Success Benefits Investors 1. Greater Accessibility IBIT makes it easier for traditional investors to participate in the Bitcoin market without the need for direct custody or complex technical knowledge. 2. Reduced Risk By offering spot Bitcoin exposure through a regulated ETF, IBIT minimizes risks associated with unregulated exchanges or storage. 3. Portfolio Diversification IBIT’s growth provides a low-barrier option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with cryptocurrency exposure. Challenges and Risks Ahead Despite its rapid success, IBIT and the broader Bitcoin ETF market face potential challenges: 1. Regulatory Scrutiny As spot Bitcoin ETFs gain popularity, they may attract increased scrutiny from regulators concerned about market manipulation and investor protection. 2. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s inherent volatility could impact the ETF’s growth trajectory, particularly during bearish market cycles. 3. Competitive Landscape With other major financial institutions entering the Bitcoin ETF space, competition could dilute inflows and slow IBIT’s growth. What’s Next for BlackRock’s IBIT? BlackRock’s IBIT is likely to continue its upward trajectory, driven by: Global Adoption of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The U.S. market’s success could inspire similar products worldwide, expanding IBIT’s reach. Institutional Acceleration: Ongoing demand from institutions could push IBIT’s AUM beyond $100 billion in record time. Market Expansion: Bitcoin’s rising acceptance as a mainstream asset class will further strengthen IBIT’s position in the financial ecosystem. Conclusion BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) reaching $50 billion in AUM in just 228 days is a testament to the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a mainstream investment. By achieving this milestone at an unprecedented pace, IBIT not only sets a new standard for ETFs but also highlights Bitcoin’s increasing relevance in the global financial landscape.

37255924,https://crypto.news/?p=14316534,1733409558,BNB price is beating Ethereum and Bitcoin; CZ responds,"Binance Coin continued its strong performance this week, reaching an all-time high of $794. Binance Coin ( BNB ) has done better than some large coins like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ) over the last 12 months. It has gained 220%, compared to BTC’s 133% and ETH’s 71% rise in the same period. In response to an X post highlighting this performance, Changpeng Zhao noted that investors often focus on 24-hour performance, missing the broader long-term gains. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1864632916761776239 The BNB price momentum is being driven by its strong fundamentals and technicals. Fundamentally, the DeFi total value locked in the BSC ecosystem has jumped to almost $6 billion , making it the fourth-biggest chain after Ethereum, Solana, and Tron. BSC’s protocols in the DEX industry have also seen a sharply in the past few months, helped by the ongoing crypto rally. It has handled tokens worth $9.91 billion in the last 30 days and $1.17 trillion cumulatively. You might also like: How high can the Dogecoin price get by December 31? Additionally, the BNB Chain has been actively burning coins. The most recent quarterly burn removed 2.02 million coins from circulation. Binance’s long-term goal is to reduce the total Binance Coin supply to 100 million coins. The BNB price has also done well after Binance launched BFUSD, a stablecoin that promises a yield of almost 20%. These developments have created more utility for the Binance coin. Another driver of BNB’s rally is the resolution of regulatory concerns. Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s founder, recently completed his prison sentence in the United States, reducing some of the regulatory overhang affecting the coin. BNB price has strong technicals BNB price chart | source: crypto.news Meanwhile, Binance Coin has strong technicals that could push its price much higher than where it is today. On the weekly chart, the coin has formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish sign. It has now moved above the upper side of this pattern, a sign that bulls have prevailed. The distance between the upper and lower edges of the cup suggests a potential 70% rally. Applying this measurement from the breakout point indicates a possible target of $1,170. The Murrey Math Lines tool also supports a bullish outlook, showing that BNB has moved above the “weak, stop & reverse” level, suggesting it could advance to $875, the “extreme overshoot” level. However, a drop below the key support level at $625, identified as the “strong pivot reverse” level, would invalidate the bullish outlook.

This time, they seem to be congregating around a groundbreaking DeFi blockchain solution, setting the stage for what could be a seismic shift in the blockchain ecosystem. But why is this happening now, and who’s the recipient of their massive interest? By the end of this blog post, you’ll gain insight into the movements behind the scenes, pinpoint the blockchain spearheading this evolution, and understand why December might mark a tipping point. Buckle up; it’s about to get exciting. The Growing Influence of Ethereum Whales Ethereum whales—individuals or entities holding massive amounts of Ether (typically $1 million or more)—command undeniable influence over the crypto market. Their activities often signal the start of significant market trends. Recently, whale wallets have been allocating large portions of their ETH reserves away from the Ethereum network. The destination? High-potential DeFi blockchains showcasing next-level innovation. Why Are Ethereum Whales Looking Elsewhere? Despite Ethereum’s dominance in the DeFi space, scalability issues and high gas fees remain persistent challenges. While Ethereum Layer 2 solutions have mitigated some of these issues, whales seem to be on the hunt for faster, more cost-efficient alternatives—without compromising security or innovation. Cue Lightchain AI , a rising DeFi-powered blockchain that’s turning heads for its groundbreaking features, including an AI-driven Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and an Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Enter Lightchain AI: The DeFi Blockchain Catching Everyone’s Attention At the heart of this whale migration lies a game-changing DeFi blockchain with immense potential— Lightchain AI . Promising lightning-fast transactions, decentralized governance, and powerful AI integrations, Lightchain AI is delivering solutions Ethereum hasn’t yet mastered. Here’s what sets Lightchain AI apart and why whales are accumulating tokens as quickly as possible. 1. Revolutionary Technology Stack Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Say goodbye to energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) and traditional Proof of Stake (PoS). PoI rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations—think model training or data optimization—making contributions meaningful beyond simple network security. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): This unique computational layer allows for seamless execution of AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). Developers can tap into powerful AI without relying on centralized platforms, ensuring scalability and privacy. 2. Efficiency Meets Innovation Ethereum whales have long grumbled about the network’s hefty transaction fees and scalability issues. Lightchain AI solves these problems through unmatched computational synergy between blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. What does this mean? Faster transactions and drastically reduced costs, making the network ideal for decentralized finance, supply chain management, and even NFT marketplaces. 3. Decentralized Governance and Community Trust Ethereum’s governance system, while functional, lacks robust mechanisms for true community-driven decision-making. Lightchain AI features a transparent ecosystem where token holders can actively vote on network changes. The integration of AI to streamline governance decisions fosters trust and encourages participation—a magnet for whales looking to support transparent, secure platforms. Why December Matters Market experts have sharp eyes on December 2024 , predicting it may signal a shift in whale dominance from Ethereum toward newer blockchain networks like Lightchain AI. Here’s why the timing matters now more than ever. Upcoming Mainnet Launch Lightchain AI’s roadmap places its Mainnet launch right around the corner. With features like fully activated PoI, AIVM functionalities, and increased partnerships, December is shaping up to be a landmark moment. Token Supply Scarcity Current presale rounds for Lightchain AI tokens (LCAI) are close to selling out, leading many to believe the network’s token value will surge as demand outweighs supply. This limited window is driving Ethereum whales to act quickly. Growing Community Momentum With over 12,000 active Telegram users and glowing reviews on platforms like X, Lightchain AI continues to gain a loyal following. This surge in community support signals that whales aren’t the only ones looking toward Lightchain AI’s future. A Glimpse Into Lightchain AI’s Future With technology like PoI and AIVM at its core, Lightchain AI has the potential to redefine how decentralized ecosystems operate. Beyond tackling Ethereum’s scalability problems, Lightchain AI fosters a future where blockchain and artificial intelligence seamlessly converge. Case Study Forecasts with Lightchain AI For those wondering what this means in practical terms, consider these potential applications of Lightchain AI technology: DeFi Loan Predictions: Intelligent forecasting tools powered by AIVM could significantly reduce risk for decentralized loan providers. Dynamic NFTs: Developers can design self-evolving NFTs that ‘learn’ from user interactions, opening the door to unprecedented interactivity. Ethical Supply Chains: Organizations could execute AI audits on their supply chain operations directly within the blockchain, ensuring transparency and sustainability. Why Investors Should Keep an Eye on Lightchain AI The migration of Ethereum whales to Lightchain AI isn’t just a trend—it’s a signal. The blockchain space is evolving, and those who leverage cutting-edge DeFi blockchains like Lightchain AI stand to gain a first-mover advantage. Whales are betting big, and for good reason. The convergence of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence could open up a trillion-dollar market by 2030. As an innovator pioneering this integration, Lightchain AI is uniquely positioned to lead the charge. Make the Shift Before It’s Too Late If you’re a crypto enthusiast or DeFi investor looking to ride the next major wave, now’s the time to act. Take a cue from Ethereum whales who already recognize Lightchain AI as a blockchain tailor-made for the future. 🚀 Don’t miss your chance to be part of this revolution!

It’s a unique fusion of ninja-themed storytelling and robust utility, combining staking rewards, Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming, and exclusive NFTs to create a vibrant ecosystem. With the crypto community abuzz about its imminent listing on Cetus Protocol, Suiruto is capturing the attention of early adopters and DeFi enthusiasts alike. The presale has already raised significant funds, with its token price set to increase by 50% upon listing. This makes it the last chance for early adopters to lock in favorable entry prices. Why Suiruto Stands Out Key Features Driving Demand: Staking Rewards : Holders of $SHIN can earn passive income through lucrative staking options, incentivizing long-term commitment to the project. Play-to-Earn Gaming : Suiruto’s P2E game integrates the $SHIN token, offering players the chance to earn rewards while enjoying engaging gameplay. NFT Ecosystem : Exclusive ninja-themed NFTs provide unique value to the community, with opportunities for collectors and investors alike. Strong Community Backing : Suiruto has cultivated a loyal and active community that continues to drive the project’s growth and adoption. Expert Predictions for December According to DeFi analysts, Suiruto’s strategic alignment of strong utility and community-driven initiatives places it in a prime position for a significant rally this December. With its listing on Cetus Protocol marking a pivotal moment in its roadmap, $SHIN is expected to gain substantial traction in the broader crypto market. Don’t Miss Out With BTC, ADA, and XRP already making headlines for their breakout performances, Suiruto’s launch adds another compelling narrative to the crypto space. Early investors have a narrow window to participate in the presale and gain exposure to a project poised for significant growth.

37256382,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316697,1733409058,Bybit Allows Mainland Chinese Users via VPN but Bars Yuan Trading,"Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has taken a cautious but bold step in accommodating mainland Chinese users, allowing them to trade on its platform through virtual private networks (VPNs). However, the exchange firmly excludes the Chinese yuan from its trading services, aligning its operations with China’s strict regulations on capital outflow. According to a South China Morning Post report , Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, announced on December 3 that the exchange began permitting signups using Chinese national IDs and passports earlier this year, catering to the “overseas Chinese community.” Zhou clarified that this also enables mainland users to bypass the country’s crypto ban using VPNs, though the exchange blocks direct access via mainland IP addresses. While this move reflects user demand and the company’s assessment of “acceptable risks,” Bybit has seen limited new user growth from mainland China due to its prohibition of yuan trading. How Will Chinese Government React To VPN Usage? According to the report, this decision is a delicate balance between meeting user demand and adhering to regulatory boundaries. Zhou explained that the Chinese government’s primary concern with cryptocurrencies lies in their potential to facilitate capital outflows, making yuan transactions a regulatory “red line” for the platform. “What the Chinese government dislikes the most about crypto is that it can facilitate capital outflow, so we won’t touch this red line.” Ben Zhou Despite the regulatory hurdles, Zhou emphasized that Bybit’s measures aim to provide access without crossing the Chinese government’s most sensitive restrictions. Users residing in mainland China who wish to trade on Bybit can connect to the platform through a VPN, which masks their location by using an IP address from a different region. However, Zhou acknowledged that the exchange has not seen a significant influx of users from mainland China, attributing this to the absence of yuan trading. The company has instead focused on expanding its reach globally, with its user base tripling from 20 million in 2022 to nearly 60 million this year . Conflicting Industry Preference: Is VPN Illegal? Bybit’s approach reflects the broader challenges of operating in regions with complex crypto regulations. Mainland China, once a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption, has banned commercial crypto activities since 2021. Despite the ban, Chinese users continue to access crypto markets through unofficial channels, including peer-to-peer trading and VPNs. Meanwhile, Bybit is also navigating regulatory landscapes beyond China. After briefly seeking a license under Hong Kong’s regulatory framework earlier this year, the exchange withdrew its application in May due to compliance concerns involving a conflict of interest. Zhou confirmed plans to reapply for the license in early 2025, citing the value of regulatory approval as a “confidence booster” for attracting talent and showcasing compliance, even if Hong Kong’s crypto market remains relatively small. Bybit’s trajectory also highlights its emergence as a significant player in the global crypto space. The exchange was ranked third-largest by daily trading volume . It has positioned itself ahead of Coinbase and trails only Binance. The platform’s growth has been fueled by its focus on derivatives trading and swift response to market opportunities, such as filling the void left by FTX’s collapse. Zhou’s pragmatic stance on VPN use contrasts with platforms like Coinbase, which have adopted stricter measures against VPN-related activities, citing security risks. This recently escalated on social media between Coinbase and EthHub co-founder Eric Conner. Seems like a lazy implementation if that's the case. There are plenty of better ways to handle this than just nuking my account. Apparently it's because I had a VPN on when doing the transfer. No warnings or anything? Check out the replies to my tweets. Seems insanely common — eric.eth (@econoar) December 2, 2024 PSA: Don't use a VPN to access Coinbase. Attackers always use VPN's, so our risk models take that as a negative sign even if you're legitimately using your own account. — Scott Shapiro shapiro.eth (@scottshapiro) December 2, 2024 Bybit, however, sees VPNs as a necessary tool for mainland Chinese users to access the global crypto market without engaging in activities that could provoke regulatory scrutiny.

37256552,https://invezz.com/?p=2370568,1733409035,"Best crypto stock to buy as Bitcoin soars past $100,000","Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ: HOOD) climbed to a multi-year high as Bitcoin soared past the closely watched $100,000 level on Thursday. The last time its shares traded above $40 was in late 2021. Investors are primarily responding to the monster rally in BTC this morning – but a massive year-to-date gain of about 250% in HOOD reflects their broader confidence in the company’s ability to expand and grow its profits at a fast clip. Bitcoin is delivering a significant boost to other crypto stocks like MicroStrategy and Coinbase as well on Thursday. Bitcoin could double to $200,000 next year Despite an exceptional rally in Robinhood stock this year, there’s reason to believe that it will push further to the upside next year. For starters, experts at Standard Chartered are fully convinced that Bitcoin could double to $200,000 by the end of 2025 – a bold forecast that should no longer be surprising considering the asset’s track record. BTC is up more than 150% for the year at writing. A Bitcoin price rally is a tailwind for Robinhood shares as it’s typically coupled with higher trading volumes that helps boost the company’s transaction-based revenue. Plus, strength in the crypto market tends to improve investor sentiment towards HOOD as well. Robinhood stock has a massive TAM Robinhood stock is an exciting pick to play the expected rally in Bitcoin as its management laid out ambitious targets for the next ten years at the investor day on December 4 th . The neobroker wants to grow by 10 times that “isn’t unthinkable given it has already grown revenue by 10x since 2019,” as per Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev. Dolev is positive on HOOD as it’s playing in a total addressable market of about $600 billion – roughly 200 times its estimated revenue for the current financial year. Mizuho’s “buy” rating on Robinhood shares is coupled with a $60 price target that signals potential for another 40% upside from here. HOOD could rally on international expansion International expansion may also help Robinhood stock continue to outperform in 2025. The financial technology company has already disclosed plans of requesting brokerage licenses in Asia and extend its product offerings to potential users in the United Kingdom next year. HOOD came in shy of Street estimates in its latest reported quarter. Still, analysts at KeyBanc reiterated their constructive view this morning, saying “product velocity, and the [team’s] confidence in operating efficiency” make Robinhood shares worth owning. A more accommodative regulatory environment under Donald Trump as the President of the United States will create a favourable operating backdrop that could help extend the momentum in asset/revenue growth as well, the investment firm told clients in its research note. Robinhood stock does not currently pay a dividend, though.

Institutional adoption, like Bitcoin ETFs, enhances accessibility and validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Bitcoin's universality, scarcity, and decentralization make it an attractive, inflation-resistant asset with global appeal. Invest cautiously, avoid market timing, and consider dollar-cost averaging to manage risk and maintain mental well-being. This article was co-produced with Nicholas Thomas (my son). Investing in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) provides great potential for portfolio diversification, involvement in financial innovation, and exposure to worldwide assets. However, it's critical to enter the cryptocurrency market with a thorough grasp of the risks that are involved. Here's what makes Bitcoin stand out: Diversification : Bitcoin operates independently of traditional financial assets, offering unique risk mitigation. Adapting to Change : Bitcoin is a leading asset in a rapidly evolving financial landscape, emphasizing the importance of staying ahead of global trends. Universal Appeal : Decentralized and borderless, Bitcoin serves as an inflation-resistant asset with global recognition. Risk Management : While Bitcoin can be volatile, its established position makes it a safer choice compared to speculative altcoins, much like how broad indices often outperform individual stock picks in traditional markets. Cryptocurrency is one of the most contentious financial products of the twenty-first century. With Bitcoin at the forefront, it offers investors a balance between risk and opportunity. Bitcoin's position as a universal asset and a significant player in financial markets makes it a desirable addition to a well-diversified portfolio, even in the face of market turbulence. In this article, we will discuss multiple strong arguments for considering a Bitcoin investment, along with an honest evaluation of the risks. 1. Diversification: Strengthening Your Portfolio Reducing investment risk requires diversification. You can prevent your portfolio from being unduly reliant on any one investment type by incorporating assets that exhibit distinct behaviors in comparable market conditions. This type of diversity is provided by Bitcoin, which functions apart from more conventional assets like equities and bonds. Unlike equities, Bitcoin’s price is driven by factors such as network adoption, technological advancements, and macroeconomic trends, making it less correlated with other financial markets. This independence means Bitcoin can act as a hedge during market volatility or periods of high inflation, providing an alternative store of value when traditional investments falter. 2. The New Age: Adapting to Financial Innovation As the world becomes more digitally connected, Bitcoin is leading the way. Bitcoin has overtaken silver as the seventh-largest asset in the world by market capitalization, demonstrating its increasing significance in international finance. The psychological propensity to oppose change, however, is the reason many investors are hesitant to embrace cryptocurrencies. Behavioral economics supports the idea that people are inherently predisposed to seek comfort and steer clear of uncertainty. People may lose out on opportunities as a result of this resistance to change, particularly as Bitcoin's position in the financial markets continues to consolidate. Staying competitive in this new era of digital assets requires not only adaptation but also making sure that your investments follow emerging trends. The rise of Bitcoin emphasizes how crucial it is to identify and take advantage of revolutionary changes in the financial sector. (Companies Market Cap, n.d.) Bitcoin’s Rising Institutional Adoption Important advancements in institutional finance are also supporting Bitcoin's increasing acceptability. The adoption of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was one of the most significant developments at the start of 2024. Traditional investors can now have exposure to Bitcoin without actually buying or holding the digital asset, thanks to the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs such as ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO). These ETFs have opened the door for more institutional participation and given regular investors more easily accessible and regulated investment options, even though I prefer to hold the digital asset myself (not my keys, not my coins). As evidence of institutional investors' growing confidence in Bitcoin's future, Bitcoin ETF inflows have actually been steady. This steady demand reflects a larger trend: Bitcoin is now considered a legitimate asset class with increasing acceptance and recognition, rather than as a speculative risk. ETFs facilitate the integration of Bitcoin into investors' portfolios without the hassles of personally holding and safeguarding the cryptocurrency, thereby validating it as a popular investment choice. Farside Investors. (n.d.). Bitcoin ETF inflows chart 3. Bitcoin: A Universal Asset What sets Bitcoin apart from traditional investments is its universality. Unlike a company stock that depends on earnings reports or regional economic policies, Bitcoin is decentralized and operates independently of any single government or institution. Unlike fiat currencies that can be created endlessly, its scarcity, capped at 21 million coins, ensures that it stays resistant to inflation. Furthermore, because Bitcoin is decentralized, it may be used and exchanged internationally without the need for middlemen. In addition to people, organizations, hedge funds, and even nation-states like El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. For investors, Bitcoin’s global appeal and resilience make it an attractive asset that transcends geographic and economic boundaries. 4. The Risks of Crypto Markets Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and this unpredictability can be both an opportunity and a risk. While Bitcoin’s position as the market leader gives it some stability, its price can still experience significant corrections. Market Corrections and Altcoins Bitcoin often sees corrections of 10–20% during periods of heightened volatility. However, altcoins, other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin, are hit even harder. These smaller, less established coins can experience corrections of 40–50% or more, making them significantly riskier. (Shutterstock Images, n.d.) This mirrors traditional markets, where a rising S&P 500 index does not guarantee that all individual stocks in the financial markets will increase in value. In fact, many stocks fail to perform even when the broader market is doing well. This concept aligns with insights from Nobel Prize-winning economist Eugene Fama, whose Efficient Market Hypothesis emphasizes that attempting to “beat the market” by picking individual stocks is statistically unlikely over the long term. Why Stick to Bitcoin? Bitcoin's established position frequently makes it a safer option than speculative altcoins, much of how the S&P 500 tends to beat most individual stock picks over time. Bitcoin's network effects, popularity, and infrastructure make it a more dependable store of value than altcoins, even though altcoins could yield huge returns. It's usually smarter to join the market by investing in Bitcoin, the industry leader, rather than attempting to “beat the market” by choosing several altcoins. Bitcoin should be the mainstay of any investor's digital asset portfolio if they want to see long-term success in the cryptocurrency market. Smaller cryptocurrencies cannot match the level of protection they offer due to their robustness and broad acceptance. By investing in Bitcoin, you’re not just participating in a growing financial trend—you’re positioning yourself to succeed in the future of global finance. Balancing its risks and rewards can provide a strong foundation for your investment portfolio. Okay, Now What? It's time to think about how to go about investing in cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, now that you have a better idea of why it would be a wise move. However, keep in mind that this is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's critical to exercise caution and make well-considered choices on risk management and investment amount. (ISORepublic, n.d.) Don’t Bet the Whole Farm Balance is crucial in investing. Investing all of your money in cryptocurrency might be dangerous, but it's tempting to jump right into what looks like the next big thing. Never wager more than you are willing to lose, as is the case with all investments. Spreading your money across several asset classes, or diversifying your investments, helps reduce risk. Despite Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market, the market is still erratic. Therefore, you should consider this when making decisions. Don’t Try to Time the Market A common mistake many investors make, whether in crypto or traditional stocks, is trying to time the market perfectly. The truth is, the best time to invest in Bitcoin was probably a few years ago, when prices were lower. The second-best time? Right now. Focusing too much on finding the “ideal” entry point leads to indecision and often missed opportunities. Instead of stressing about when to buy, it's better to create a strategy that fits your situation. One solid approach is dollar-cost averaging ((DCA)), where you invest a set amount regularly—weekly, monthly, whatever works for you—regardless of what the price is. Over time, this strategy can help smooth out the ups and downs, giving you a more consistent way to enter the market. The Mental Health Aspect Managing your emotions and mental health is just as important to investing as the data and charts. The volatility of the cryptocurrency market can be stressful, particularly if you're worried about short-term swings or are continuously monitoring the price. By using a DCA approach, you are investing in your piece of mind in addition to Bitcoin. (Pixabay Images, n.d.) You don't have to check prices every day when you use DCA. The goal is to concentrate on the long-term possibilities while letting the market do its thing. By using this technique, you may take a step back and see the wider picture without becoming overly anxious about the day-to-day fluctuations in the market.

Suiruto ($SHIN) , a stealthy ninja-themed meme coin, has been making waves with its innovative approach to combining meme culture, blockchain utility, and community driven growth. With whispers of whales accumulating $SHIN, this could be the Christmas miracle crypto investors have been waiting for. Why Suiruto Stands Out While the crypto space is saturated with projects vying for attention, Suiruto differentiates itself by blending humor, community engagement, and tangible utility. Built on the SUI blockchain, Suiruto’s ecosystem offers more than just a token, it provides a suite of features designed to reward holders and foster long-term growth. Key Highlights: Successful Presale: Suiruto’s presale was a resounding success, raising over 10,000 SUI within hours. With half of its 100 million token supply allocated to the presale and a listing price set 50% higher, early investors have already demonstrated strong confidence in the project. Community-Driven Momentum: The Suiruto community is rapidly growing, with engaged members rallying behind the project’s vision. This groundswell of support is critical for long-term success, especially in the meme coin space. Innovative Features: Staking Rewards: Token holders can stake $SHIN to earn passive income, adding an extra layer of utility to the coin. NFT Integration: Exclusive ninja-themed NFTs not only bring fun and creativity but also offer unique incentives within the Suiruto ecosystem. Play-to-Earn Gaming: Suiruto’s upcoming Play-to-Earn game will integrate $SHIN, further enhancing its value and utility. Whales Are Taking Notice Whale activity is often a key indicator of a project’s potential, and Suiruto has not gone unnoticed. Reports of significant whale accumulation suggest growing confidence in the token’s future upside. With Suiruto’s roadmap laying out plans for staking, NFT expansions, and the imminent release of its Play-to-Earn game, whales may be positioning themselves for massive gains as the project’s momentum builds. Join Suiruto Presale Now The Case for 10,000% Upside Meme coins have historically been known for their explosive growth, and Suiruto has all the ingredients for a breakout: Limited Supply: With a total supply of just 100 million tokens, Suiruto’s scarcity adds to its value proposition. Strategic Listings: Suiruto is set to debut on Cetus Protocol, a key milestone that will provide greater accessibility and liquidity. Growing Ecosystem: The combination of staking, NFTs which will be sold in $SHIN tokens, and P2E gaming ensures multiple avenues for user engagement and adoption. With these factors in play, the potential for Suiruto to achieve 10,000% gains is not far fetched. As more investors discover the project’s unique value, demand for $SHIN could skyrocket, making it a standout performer this holiday season. Don’t Miss Out on This Holiday Opportunity Suiruto isn’t just another meme coin, it’s a project with a vision to redefine the space by blending humor with real utility. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer looking to make your mark, $SHIN offers a rare opportunity to be part of something innovative and exciting. As Christmas draws closer, Suiruto could very well be the miracle crypto investors are hoping for. Don’t wait for the train to leave the station, now is the time to join the Suiruto journey and position yourself for potential life changing gains.

The Sui Foundation today announced that Phantom Wallet, the leading non-custodial multichain cryptocurrency wallet, is now integrating with the Sui network. At 7 million monthly active users, Phantom has the largest on-chain user base of wallets in the web3 industry. With over 560M total onchain transactions year-to-date, and key features such as staking, in-app token swaps, NFT storage, multichain support, and Ledger hardware wallet integration, Phantom represents a significant milestone for the Sui network, which becomes the first blockchain outside of Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum to be supported by the wallet. Sui is also the first blockchain built around the Move language to be supported by Phantom. Integrating the Sui network is also a significant step toward enhancing interoperability for Phantom Wallet, and demonstrates how wallet providers and dApp builders are betting on a multichain future rather than focusing on only one ecosystem. “The integration of Phantom Wallet with Sui represents a giant leap for the Sui ecosystem, which now gets access to a first-class wallet experience with several features that the Sui community has been asking for,” said Jameel Khalfan, Global Head of Ecosystem at the Sui Foundation. “Phantom Wallet is selective about which chains they support, and we are proud to now be included among this notable group.” The integration of Phantom will provide Sui users with a reliable and secure wallet solution available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave, as well as a mobile app for iOS and Android. “We’re excited to bring Sui support to millions of Phantom users,” said Brandon Millman, CEO of Phantom. “Sui’s thoughtful approach to scalability and developer-focused solutions aligns with our commitment to high-performant blockchains.

37255540,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623162,1733408299,TSMC in talks with Nvidia to make new AI Blackwell chips in Arizona,"TSMC is in talks with Nvidia Corp to make the Nvidia artificial intelligence Blackwell chips at its new factory in Arizona. According to a recent report by Reuters, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd is ready to begin production at the Arizona facility early next year. The information was revealed by three sources who asked not to be identified as these discussions are confidential. US plants are part of efforts to limit supply chain disruption Introduced in March, Nvidia’s Blackwell chips have been manufactured in TSMC plants in Taiwan so far. Potential clients for these highly demanded chips are companies working in generative AI and accelerated computing. Nvidia claims these Blackwell chips work 30 times faster than earlier models at tasks like providing answers for a chatbot. The company announced that it fixed design flaws in October. If finalized, the deal will make Nvidia one of the major customers of TSMC’s Arizona plant, which will begin large-scale production next year. Neither has commented on the update. Recently, the U.S. has added more restrictions to limit China from accessing advanced tech used for semiconductor manufacturing on national security grounds. On the other hand, China has retaliated as well by limiting exports of key materials used in the production of chips. TSMC’s efforts to set up manufacturing plants inside the U.S. are part of the chip maker’s strategies to minimize single-region dependency. The semiconductor giant is expanding operations in Arizona in part to ensure a more resilient supply chain for its clients, which also includes Nvidia. Apple and AMD are also customers of TSMC’s Arizona plant Apple and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are among the clients of the Taiwanese chipmaker’s Arizona plant as per two sources. Both Apple and AMD did not comment on the matter as well. While the initial stages of the manufacturing of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips will take place in TSMC’s Arizona plant, the final packaging needs to happen back in Taiwan. This is because the plant in Arizona does not have the advanced chip packaging technology known as chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) necessary to make Blackwell chips. All of TSMC CoW’s operations so far are in Taiwan. The world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, is pouring billions into the U.S. with three plants planned in Phoenix. The U.S. government is supporting these projects with large subsidies as part of a larger effort to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

While many companies have announced plans to invest some of their cash reserves in Bitcoin since the election of Donald Trump, Worksport's announcement that it will invest in XRP alongside Bitcoin is a different story. Worksport CEO Steven Rossi emphasized Bitcoin’s role in inflation protection and transaction efficiency, while also drawing attention to XRP’s potential as a stable and valuable asset. Rossi also noted that he has been personally investing in XRP for several years, saying: “I think XRP is becoming a much more stable currency and asset. Although I think XRP will be volatile like most assets in the short term, we believe that investing in XRP will benefit us in the long run. I was pleasantly surprised to see my XRP in my wallet and that XRP has been performing quite well lately. This rally reaffirms that XRP, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are early-stage assets that truly challenge central banking.” *This is not investment advice.

Backed by the Ethereum blockchain, BTFD ensures seamless transactions and top-tier security, making it a trusted platform for investors. It’s also a community-driven token, powered by its lively “Bulls Squad” that keeps the hype alive. If you’ve ever wanted to be part of a movement that turns market dips into launchpads, now’s the time. The presale is heating up, and you don’t want to miss this ride. Pepe Coin: The Meme King of 2024 Pepe Coin (PEPE) is having its moment in the sun—and then some. Inspired by the internet-famous “Pepe the Frog” meme, this token has skyrocketed by an eye-popping 1563.9% since January. It recently hit $0.00002479 after a 95% surge in just 24 hours, pushing its market cap past $10 billion. While Pepe has cooled slightly to $0.00001899, its year-to-date gains still outshine most other meme coins. What’s fuelling this rally? The coin thrives on community enthusiasm and social media hype, with platforms like Robinhood and Coinbase now listing it, making Pepe accessible to millions more investors. But here’s the catch: Pepe isn’t without its challenges. Operating on the Ethereum blockchain means it faces high transaction fees and slower speeds, which could deter smaller investors. Even so, its trading volume regularly beats out Shiba Inu (SHIB), suggesting more room for growth. For those who missed the early Dogecoin or Shiba Inu waves, Pepe’s consistent momentum makes it one of the best meme coins to join this week. Its ability to rally amidst market volatility proves it’s staying power in a space where popularity is everything. Ponke: The Underdog with Big Dreams Ponke (PONKE) might not have Pepe’s fame or BTFD’s presale buzz but don’t sleep on this Solana-based gem. Trading at $0.5603, Ponke is making steady strides in both price and ecosystem development. The coin’s recent listings on Bithumb and Binance have added fuel to its growth, with Binance’s perpetual contracts sparking a 12% price jump. What sets Ponke apart is its ecosystem. Its decentralised exchange, PonkeSwap, simplifies token swaps and enhances the coin’s utility, making it more than just another meme token. With a market cap of $323.43 million and nearly one million followers across social media, Ponke’s community is as vibrant as its roadmap. While Ponke isn’t immune to market retracements, its consistent growth and active user base keep it in the running for investors looking for stable yet promising projects. If you’re into Solana-based innovations and want a coin with room to grow, Ponke deserves a spot on your watchlist. Conclusion: Which Meme Coin Should You Buy? Based on our analysis, these three meme coins offer something unique for every type of investor. BTFD stands out with its game-changing presale and staking rewards, making it a prime choice for those looking to maximise early-stage gains. Pepe, with its viral momentum and growing accessibility, is perfect for FOMO-driven traders. And Ponke’s steady ecosystem development ensures it’s a solid pick for those seeking long-term growth. But don’t wait too long to get into the best meme coins to join this week . Meme coins are volatile, and timing is everything.

37255237,https://thecoinrise.com/india-emerges-as-a-global-hub-for-web3-innovation-report/,1733408143,India Emerges as a Global Hub for Web3 Innovation: Report,"India dynamic startup ecosystem, backed by significant global investment and local adoption, is cementing its position as a leader in the Web3 revolution. A report released during the India Blockchain Week conference on December 4 reveals that India is home to over 1,000 Web3 startups spanning finance, infrastructure, and entertainment. According to the study by Hashed Emergent, India accounts for nearly 12% of the world’s crypto developers, making it the second-largest developer base after the United States. By 2027, it is projected to take the top spot, fueled by a growing pool of Web3 founders and an influx of investment. Since 2020, Indian Web3 startups have raised over $3 billion, with $462 million secured in just the first nine months of 2024—a staggering 82% growth year-over-year. Rising Investments and Evolving Trends This investment surge has been driven by global Web3 funds, accelerator programs, and contributions from major blockchain ecosystems. Much of the funding has been funneled into Web3 infrastructure, underscoring its critical role in the broader ecosystem. Despite initial hesitation caused by India’s stringent crypto tax policies , 2024 has witnessed a revival in crypto trading on centralized exchanges, propelled by emerging markets and new investment categories. Data from CoinDCX highlights the dominance of blue-chip cryptocurrencies, comprising approximately 45% of retail investor portfolios. Meanwhile, trading volumes for memecoins have skyrocketed, driven primarily by Millennials and Gen Z investors. Web3 gaming is another area experiencing exponential growth. Industry network Lysto predicts that India’s gaming market will reach $9.2 billion within five years, with Web3 gaming contributing significantly. Higher average revenue per user in this sector underscores the promise of blockchain-powered gaming platforms. Regulatory Challenges India’s Web3 landscape is bolstered by several government-backed initiatives targeting land registries, digital certification, and supply chain management. Contributions from leading blockchain protocols like Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Starknet further enhance innovation and adoption. However, regulatory hurdles remain a major challenge. The government’s pro-blockchain but anti-crypto stance, coupled with inequitable tax policies and lingering political skepticism , has the potential to stifle innovation. Despite these obstacles, India continues to lead in crypto adoption globally, with strong onchain activity outpacing countries like the U.S., U.K., and China. India’s unique combination of technical talent, global partnerships, and government-backed initiatives positions it to shape the future of Web3, but overcoming regulatory barriers will be key to unlocking its full potential.

The rise in the value of the star token, Bitcoin, helped the SOL price rise break the crucial resistance. Now that the price has initiated a huge breakout, the token is believed to maintain a steady ascending trend. However, the possibility of a bearish reversal also emerges, which could drag the levels back to $235 and levels slightly below. However, there could be a major twist if the SOL price manages to break certain resistance. Will the price mark highs at $300 in 2024? The bearish activity had outpowered the Solana bulls ever since the token formed a new ATH above $264. The price dropped further and the plunge in volume prevented the bulls from lifting the levels from the interim lows. However, with the beginning of the fresh monthly trade, the bulls seem to have gained acute strength. As a result, after the current breakout, the SOL price is primed to surpass the current ATH to reach $270 shortly. The short-term price action of Solana suggests the price has broken the upper resistance of the descending parallel channel and attracted bearish attention. However, the technicals continue to remain bullish, which suggests the price may withstand the bearish pressure and eventually enter the resistance zone between $247.09 and $250. The stochastic RSI has rebounded from the interim descensing trend, indicating the levels to remain around the upper threshold for a while. This hints towards an extended bullish consolidation that may assist the SOL price to rise above $250. Secondly, the Ichimoku cloud has just turned bullish in the short term, with the conversion & base line undergoing a bullish crossover. This suggests the start of a fresh bullish trend that could keep up the bullish momentum for a quiet long time until it validates the start of a fresh bullish spell. Therefore, the Solana price could reach $300 before the end of 2024, provided the upcoming weekly close needs to be above the current ATH. Otherwise, the price may remain consolidated below the ATH for a long time and just before the yearly close could validate a strong upswing.",POSITIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/solana-breaks-from-a-bearish-consolidation-will-this-result-in-a-25-upswing/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Developed by a global team of 13 passionate builders, Evrloot offers a rogue-like, light-MMO experience in a medieval fantasy world, combining deep gameplay with innovative on-chain mechanics. Evrloot distinguishes itself from most Web3 games with a unique approach: Build a fun on-chain game first, talk later. The game empowers players by treating NFTs as save games, making progress and achievements tangible and tradeable on-chain. Players’ in-game experiences—whether mastering fishing or crafting a powerful weapon—are captured as soulbound or equipable ERC-6220, essentially NFTs 2.0 that can be seamlessly accessed across ecosystems, ensuring every victory stays with the players. Players will have the opportunity to explore idle missions, tactical auto-battler dungeons, and on-chain crafting systems. Key features include: Idle Missions: Players can deploy special bait to send their character on a six-hour fishing expedition, offering the chance to discover rare items. Crafting: Resources such as fish and herbs can be combined to mint health potions. Tactical Dungeons: Players equip their loot to navigate dangerous dungeons. Only those who exit safely keep their spoils, which are minted on-chain. NFT Trading Marketplace: Valuable items, such as a ‘Damaged Battle Axe,’ can be exchanged for health potions and other resources through the game’s native marketplace. Evrloot began as a passion project from Polkadot fans who believed NFTs could do more than just exist as collectibles. The game has grown steadily during its beta phase, recording over 1.5 million on-chain transactions on Kusama and Polkadot and fostering a community of around 400 NFT owners. It peaked at 1,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) during the successful “Pink Event.” For the full release, the game will launch on Moonbeam, with a seamless onboarding experience featuring wallet and gas abstraction. Evrloot’s launch prioritizes accessibility. Players can dive into the full gameplay experience without barriers—no crypto wallet or upfront payment required. As they progress, players have the option to upgrade their free-to-play characters to NFTs for enhanced features. However, the game ensures that free players enjoy the complete experience without any pressure to upgrade. Tobi “Deckard” Amann, CEO of Chainfood Studio, the developers of Evrloot shared, “Our goal with Evrloot is to create an immersive and thrilling Dark Fantasy Web3 world that prioritizes fun and player enjoyment, transforming the world into a canvas for its players. Through their in-game actions, players shape the story and forge the lore of this world. As RPG enthusiasts, creating a canvas like this has always been our dream—and with Evrloot, we’ve found an exciting and ethical opportunity to bring our vision fully on-chain.” “I am very excited to see Evrloot enter its next growth phase. Chainfood studio has a very special game in Evrloot with a fiercely loyal community – moving to a Free-To-Play model will give them a lot more exposure and will allow a lot more players discover what makes this game so special.” said Sicco Naets, Head of Ecosystem Development at Moonbeam. Evrloot’s player onboarding uses a gamified affiliate campaign. Players join in-game clans that link back to the affiliates that brought them to the game. Being part of an active in-game clan not only shows player alliance with existing communities, it boosts the points they can potentially earn that are important for Phase II of the campaign. Players join for free and can optionally upgrade to one of 1299 exclusive NFT 2.0 Characters. With freemium upgrades, cosmetics, and marketplace fees driving the business model, Evrloot offers a sustainable economy without compromising the player experience. While Evrloot operates without a token at launch, players are able to gather Points by completing tasks and referring friends. Evrloot will also run a giveaway campaign to coincide with the game’s launch. Players who participate in specific in-game activities will have the chance to win 1 of 3 exclusive merch packs featuring original hand-drawn concept art on hand-made medieval paper, an Evrloot T-shirt, and stickers. Players can enter by joining the “ ” clan for at least one day between the release date and December 21st. Winners will be drawn on December 21st and contacted via X (if linked in-game).

37255175,https://finbold.com/?p=217017,1733407961,Bitcoin becomes 10th largest currency in the world,"The original and foundational cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has, unsurprisingly, consistently maintained the largest market capitalization of all digital assets. But it hasn’t exactly been a smooth ride — the volatile nature of crypto has led to numerous intense price changes that have added or subtracted billions in BTC’s market cap in short timeframes. In 2024, a promising first quarter was followed up by an extended period of sideways trading without a clear trend. Since mid-October however, things have changed — Bitcoin, as well as the wider crypto market, is now in a bull run, buoyed by tailwinds from resurgent recession fears and the election of Donald Trump , widely seen as the pro-crypto candidate of the 2024 presidential race. While it hit a few snags along the way, Bitcoin has now reached a new all-time high, reaching prices above $100,000 for the first time. At press time, one BTC was trading at approximately $102,632. BTC price YTD chart. Source: Finbold With this latest move to the upside comes another significant milestone — at the time of writing, Bitcoin is now the 10th largest currency in the entire world — a fact that could very well serve to further legitimize the asset as not only a speculative investment but a store of value. BTC’s market cap has surpassed the Australian Dollar — is the Hong Kong Dollar next? The combined worth of all the Bitcoin in circulation — estimated to be 19,790,568 Bitcoins, has shot past the market capitalization of the Australian dollar, estimated to be equivalent to 19,485,928 BTC, per data retrieved by Finbold on December 5 from FiatMarketCap . At present, Bitcoin’s total supply is worth more than the total supply of some of the fiat currencies tied to several major economies — including the Swiss Franc, the New Taiwan Dollar, and the Brazilian Real. The market capitalization of major currencies in BTC. Source: FiatMarketCap A larger gap remains between BTC and the next largest currency in the world, the Hong Kong Dollar, whose total market capitalization is worth roughly 22,867,604 BTC at the time of publication. To surpass the HKD, Bitcoin would have to see another 15% move to the upside — a prospect that isn’t unlikely at all, when looking at past market cycles. As the leading digital asset continues to climb towards $110,000, some $8 billion in short positions is at risk of liquidation — if that happens, the bull run could see renewed vigor as buying pressure increases. In the long term, BTC prices could reach much greater levels — technical analysis based on Fibonacci levels shared by profiling trading expert TradingShot suggests that by early 2025, Bitcoin could trade at levels closer to $140,000 . While impressive, this would still leave it with a slightly smaller market capitalization than the Hong Kong Dollar — but going forward, it seems likely that it’s only a matter of time before BTC surpasses it.

Deaton’s demands follow reports suggesting that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a new chair for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Trump Nominates Paul Atkins as Next SEC Chair Yesterday, Trump announced the nomination of former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as the next SEC Chair. The announcement, made via a Truth Social post, comes weeks after several reports highlighted Atkins as the top candidate for the position.Despite initially hesitating to take up the job due to the massive efforts required to restore the SEC’s gold standard, which many believe Gensler destroyed, Atkins finally accepted the nomination shortly after meeting with Trump’s transition team earlier this week. Upon accepting the role, Trump published a Truth Social post emphasizing that Atkins would serve as the next SEC Chair under his administration. Four Things Atkins Must Do on Day One Following the nomination, Attorney Deaton highlighted four major things Atkins must do on his first day in office to show he is the right candidate for the position. Address DEBT Box Saga First, Deaton recommended that the next SEC Chair address the Debt Box issue and fire everyone involved in the saga. This incident revolves around the SEC's lawsuit against crypto-related firm Digital Licensing Inc., commonly called DEBT Box. Counsel to the SEC admitted to misleading the court in securing a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against the company. Consequently, the judge dismissed the lawsuit based on the SEC's request and ordered the commission to pay DEBT Box’s legal fees of $1.8 million. Although some SEC lawyers resigned following the DEBT Box saga, Attorney Deaton is asking the next SEC Chair to sack everyone involved. Overhaul at the SEC Second, Deaton requested that Atkins sack or demote any SEC staff appointed into key leadership roles by Gensler, whom he labeled a bad-faith regulator. According to Deaton, the next SEC Chair should carefully select his team members who will align with Trump’s vision of making America the Crypto Capital of the world. Clarity for Self-Custody and DeFi For the third demand, Deaton suggested that Atkins clarify that decentralized finance (DeFi) and self-custody are not subject to the SEC’s regulatory purview. This clarification would mark a significant shift from Gensler’s approach, which has seen him give the securities tag to almost everything relating to crypto. It bears mentioning that a part of Trump’s campaign promise involves protecting the right to self-custody. Disband the Crypto Unit Lastly, the U.S. Senate for Massachusetts at the just-concluded election further urged the newly appointed SEC Chair to disband the Crypto Unit at the securities agency, which focuses mainly on cryptocurrencies. According to Deaton, there is no need for a dedicated Crypto Unit at the SEC. Instead, he recommended that the new chairman establish a general fraud unit at the commission that will tackle all fraudulent activities across various sectors, including crypto and the securities market. In the meantime, the crypto market is still reacting positively to Atkins' nomination as SEC Chair due to his pro-Bitcoin stance. Bitcoin is still trading above the $100,000 mark, with the asset currently priced at $102,943.

Developed by a global team of 13 passionate builders, Evrloot offers a rogue-like, light-MMO experience in a medieval fantasy world, combining deep gameplay with innovative on-chain mechanics. Evrloot distinguishes itself from most Web3 games with a unique approach: Build a fun on-chain game first, talk later. The game empowers players by treating NFTs as save games, making progress and achievements tangible and tradeable on-chain. Players’ in-game experiences—whether mastering fishing or crafting a powerful weapon—are captured as soulbound or equipable ERC-6220, essentially NFTs 2.0 that can be seamlessly accessed across ecosystems, ensuring every victory stays with the players. Players will have the opportunity to explore idle missions, tactical auto-battler dungeons, and on-chain crafting systems. Key features include: Idle Missions: Players can deploy special bait to send their character on a six-hour fishing expedition, offering the chance to discover rare items. Crafting: Resources such as fish and herbs can be combined to mint health potions. Tactical Dungeons: Players equip their loot to navigate dangerous dungeons. Only those who exit safely keep their spoils, which are minted on-chain. NFT Trading Marketplace: Valuable items, such as a ‘Damaged Battle Axe,’ can be exchanged for health potions and other resources through the game’s native marketplace. Evrloot began as a passion project from Polkadot fans who believed NFTs could do more than just exist as collectibles. The game has grown steadily during its beta phase, recording over 1.5 million on-chain transactions on Kusama and Polkadot and fostering a community of around 400 NFT owners. It peaked at 1,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) during the successful “Pink Event.” For the full release, the game will launch on Moonbeam, with a seamless onboarding experience featuring wallet and gas abstraction. Evrloot’s launch prioritizes accessibility. Players can dive into the full gameplay experience without barriers—no crypto wallet or upfront payment required. As they progress, players have the option to upgrade their free-to-play characters to NFTs for enhanced features. However, the game ensures that free players enjoy the complete experience without any pressure to upgrade. Tobi “Deckard” Amann, CEO of Chainfood Studio, the developers of Evrloot shared, “Our goal with Evrloot is to create an immersive and thrilling Dark Fantasy Web3 world that prioritizes fun and player enjoyment, transforming the world into a canvas for its players.

The Sui Foundation today announced that Phantom Wallet, the leading non-custodial multichain cryptocurrency wallet, is now integrating with the Sui network. At 7 million monthly active users, Phantom has the largest on-chain user base of wallets in the web3 industry. With over 560M total onchain transactions year-to-date, and key features such as staking, in-app token swaps, NFT storage, multichain support, and Ledger hardware wallet integration, Phantom represents a significant milestone for the Sui network, which becomes the first blockchain outside of Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum to be supported by the wallet. Sui is also the first blockchain built around the Move language to be supported by Phantom. Integrating the Sui network is also a significant step toward enhancing interoperability for Phantom Wallet, and demonstrates how wallet providers and dApp builders are betting on a multichain future rather than focusing on only one ecosystem. “The integration of Phantom Wallet with Sui represents a giant leap for the Sui ecosystem, which now gets access to a first-class wallet experience with several features that the Sui community has been asking for,” said Jameel Khalfan, Global Head of Ecosystem at the Sui Foundation. “Phantom Wallet is selective about which chains they support, and we are proud to now be included among this notable group.” The integration of Phantom will provide Sui users with a reliable and secure wallet solution available as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave, as well as a mobile app for iOS and Android. ""We're excited to bring Sui support to millions of Phantom users,"" said Brandon Millman, CEO of Phantom.

Both of these altcoins are primed to run hard. That said, all eyes are still on Bitcoin. As soon as Bitcoin pauses in its latest upside bid, look for $ETH and $SOL to do some serious catch-up. $ETH breaks out of 2-year triangle Source: TradingView The $ETH (ETH/USD) price is already doing much to reverse the long period of relative inaction relative to the extraordinary feats of $BTC. A breakout of a triangle in force since late 2021 is definitely a fillip to the $ETH bulls. There is still the rest of this week to go before this breakout is confirmed, but things are looking very good so far. The next target for the bulls is to make a higher high, which the price is not very far from doing. That said, the current level is very strong resistance. $4,860 is the all-time high if this can be held above. Have $ETH bulls finally arrested the slide against $BTC? Source: TradingView Looking at the $ETH price against its $BTC pair (ETH/BTC) it can be seen that $ETH still has much to do. It appears that the $ETH bulls may have arrested the slide at the 0.036 BTC horizontal support, but the descending channel must be broken to the upside. $SOL breaking out of bull flag Source: TradingView The $SOL (SOL/USD) price is currently breaking out of a bull flag. This is in the daily chart, so the bulls will need to keep the price above the top trendline of the flag until close of play on Thursday for this to be a confirmed breakout. The measured move for the flag is to $330. $SOL about to resume uptrend against $BTC Source: TradingView The $SOL price against its $BTC pair (SOL/BTC) has much more potential than the (ETH/BTC) pair. It can be seen that despite a terrible bear market for $SOL, when it lost 90% of its value against $BTC; this bull market has seen $SOL record some great gains against $BTC so far. The price is currently traversing sideways within a wedge pattern. Given that the price entered the pattern from below, and the trend is up, it might be expected that $SOL breaks out against $BTC at some point. Currently near the bottom of the wedge, a bounce from here could send the price back to the top of the wedge and that potential breakout.

37255011,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623103,1733407378,UK detects crypto laundering pipeline used by gangsters and Russian intelligence,"The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) has blown the lid off a multibillion-dollar laundering scheme that reads like something out of a spy thriller. A tangled web of Russian intelligence operatives, cocaine traffickers, and cybercriminals funneled dirty money through London, Moscow, and Dubai, using crypto to dodge sanctions and mask their operations. The network was fueled by Tether’s USDT stablecoin, which basically served as the secret handshake between organized crime and geopolitical espionage. “Operation Destabilise” uncovered this sprawling underworld spanning over 30 countries, exposing the murky marriage between gangsters and governments. For Russian spies and sanctioned elites, crypto became a lifeline. For drug cartels and ransomware gangs, it was the perfect tool to clean up piles of illicit cash. From cocaine cartels to Kremlin agents At the heart of the scheme were two companies—Smart and TGR. These guys reportedly acted as financial hubs for criminals who couldn’t rely on traditional banks. Cocaine traffickers like the Kinahan cartel, infamous for contract killings, moved their cash into this pipeline. Meanwhile, Russian intelligence agencies leaned on the same network to sidestep sanctions and fund espionage. It was a dirty money laundering machine that worked with ruthless efficiency, leaving no trail for investigators to follow—at least until now. Here’s how it worked. Criminals in countries like the UK handed over physical cash to couriers. That cash was then processed through businesses linked to the network. The equivalent value was provided in crypto, often in different countries, making the money virtually untraceable. USDT became the favored currency, replacing Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, USDT is stable, pegged to the US dollar, which means criminals didn’t have to worry about value fluctuations while their shady deals played out. Rob Jones, the NCA’s director-general, described the operation as the most significant money laundering case they’ve ever handled. “It’s McMafia meets Narcos,” he said. A global web of illicit deals The NCA’s investigation revealed just how deeply entrenched this network was. Over a four-month period, the operation collected cash from 55 locations across the UK, including England, Scotland, Wales, and the Channel Islands. TGR and Smart facilitated these collections, allowing 22 criminal groups to clean their money. The Russian state-run media group RT, already sanctioned, used the same network to secretly fund a UK-based Russian-language media organization. If that wasn’t enough, the crypto pipeline also allegedly helped Russia acquire Western technology for its invasion of Ukraine. Garantex, a crypto exchange sanctioned by both the UK and US, featured prominently in this sordid tale. Transactions linked to Garantex were tied to weapons components for Russia’s military. The scale of money laundering in the UK alone is staggering. NCA officials estimate that over £100 billion is laundered through or within the UK every year, with £5 billion of that involving crypto. The COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated the problem. The NCA seized £20 million in cash and crypto and arrested 84 individuals. Among them was Ekaterina Zhdanova, a Moscow-based businesswoman who ran TGR. Known for gracing the covers of Russian business magazines, Zhdanova allegedly funneled over $100 million to the UAE for a sanctioned Russian oligarch. She also bypassed “know your customer” checks to purchase British properties. Currently in custody in France, Zhdanova has become the face of this scandal. But she wasn’t alone. TGR’s leadership included George Rossi, Elena Chirkinyan, and Andrejs Bradens, all sanctioned by the US Treasury.

Bitcoin MVRV Ratio For 30-Day Traders Has Declined Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the trend in the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. The MVRV Ratio here refers to an indicator that keeps track of how the value held by the BTC investors (that is, the market cap) compares against the value that they initially put in (the realized cap). Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin See Lack Of Euphoria: Why This Is Bullish When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the market as a whole is in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold implies the dominance of loss among the investors. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio for the entire market isn’t of interest, but rather that of two specific holding ranges: 30-day and 365-day. The indicator corresponding to these ranges provides insight into the profit-loss breakdown of the monthly and yearly buyers of the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio for the 30-day and 365-day traders over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio for the 30-day investors had shot up to significant levels last month as the asset’s all-time high (ATH) exploration had taken place. Since the cryptocurrency has fallen to its consolidation phase, though, the metric has observed a cooldown. In the chart, Santiment has highlighted three zones for the indicator based on the historical trend. It would appear that the earlier increase had seen the metric surge into the ‘danger’ region, but with this decline, it’s now back inside the ‘healthy’ range. More specifically, the indicator has a value of 4.2% now, which is just inside the +5% to -5% range of the healthy zone. From the chart, it’s visible that the metric was last at this level on 26 November, just after which BTC observed a rebound. Generally, the tendency of the investors to sell goes up the higher amount of profits that they own, so high values of the MVRV Ratio can be a bad sign for the asset’s price. This is why the indicator being higher than 5% corresponds to the danger zone. Related Reading: Strong Bitcoin Rise “Expected Within 1-2 Months,” Quant Explains Why With the MVRV Ratio of the 30-day traders making a return into the healthy range, it’s possible that Bitcoin may be able to see a resumption of its rally or at least, avoid a further drop. The indicator for those who bought within the past year sits at more than 37%, but usually, investors who have been holding for so long don’t tend to sell easily, so these high profits may not be an immediate threat to BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $94,900, down 1% over the last week.

37254762,https://crypto.news/?p=14316469,1733407191,"Tether CEO unveils updated stablecoin portfolio roadmap: Bitcoin mining, TradFi and commodity trading","Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino reveals some of the stablecoin firm’s recent investments in a variety of sectors, ranging from Bitcoin mining, TradFi to payments for commodity trades. During ann interview at the Emergence Conference in Prague on Dec. 5, Paolo Ardoino stated that Tether ( USDT ) has made more than $13 billion in profits. Tether currently has more than $135 billion in market cap and more than $6 billion in additional excess equity. Those funds are used to expand on Tether’s ever-growing stablecoin investment portfolio. “When the stable coin and the rest has been invested outside the preservers as a separate point of view from a separate company, called Tether investments have been invested in different areas,” said Ardoino. One of those areas is Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining. Ardoino revealed that he and the Tether team are “big fans” of Bitcoin mining and would like to actively participate in securing Bitcoin’s finite supply so that it does not become too decentralized. He admitted that Tether has invested in Bitcoin mining firms in smaller countries as well as in Central and South America. “With Bitcoin, we cannot rely on two or three companies to mine, to be 90% miners. And so we need to add additional forces from across the world to make Bitcoin safe. So that’s one of our main immature investments,” said Ardoino. You might also like: Major Bitcoin miners spent $3.6 billion on infrastructure Another area of interest for Tether is TradFi and coin trading. He said that Tether has initiated a few deals in the TradFi world and has acted as “a short term lender” for people in different operations. In addition, Ardoino said that Tether has been exploring the use of Tether for cross-border payments, specifically in commodity trading. He believes stablecoins can become a “game-changer” in the field of commodity trade as it can simplify the payment process immensely. Compared to regular credit transfers that usually take longer, USDT arrives much faster after being sent through the blockchain, and the payment will be confirmed in only a matter of seconds. “So that’s one of the areas where we are planning to dedicate a lot of resources because we can see how the USDT could be a game-changer,” said Ardoino. In addition, Tether has also been investing in a range of “small companies all around the world,” Ardoino added, with many of them located in developing countries within emerging markets. Other investments that Tether has continued from past dealings are the brain-computer interface tech company Blackrock Neurotech and AI infrastructure firm Northern Data Group.

37254767,https://coinpaper.com/6395/crypto-com-teams-up-with-mastercard-for-gcc-market-expansion,1733407139,Crypto.com Teams Up with Mastercard for GCC Market Expansion,"In a month marked by significant milestones for the cryptocurrency industry, November saw a record-breaking surge in trading activity on centralized exchanges, surpassing $10 trillion in combined spot and derivatives volumes. This unprecedented growth coincided with key developments, including Mastercard's partnership with Crypto.com to introduce prepaid crypto card services in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Mastercard Partners with Crypto.com to Launch Prepaid Crypto Card Services in GCC Mastercard has granted a license to Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com to launch its prepaid payment card services in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. The rollout will commence in Bahrain in January 2025, with plans for expansion across the rest of the GCC. This partnership represents a significant step forward in integrating cryptocurrency with traditional financial systems, leveraging Mastercard's global network to deliver enhanced payment solutions in a region known for its progressive approach to blockchain and digital currencies. According to Mastercard's official announcement, the new prepaid card will be integrated into Crypto.com’s ecosystem, allowing users to fund their accounts through the Crypto.com app. Customers will have the flexibility to use e-money wallets or third-party-issued credit and debit cards to load their accounts. The card will cater to all five tiers of Crypto.com’s offerings, including the premium ”Black Obsidian” card, which provides rewards of up to 8% and card payouts in US dollars. The tiered structure ensures inclusivity, offering benefits to both casual users and crypto enthusiasts who invest heavily in the platform. The announcement has stirred excitement within the cryptocurrency community, with many praising the partnership as a strategic move that enhances Crypto.com’s services in a region that previously lacked Visa-backed offerings. Social media platforms, particularly X, have been abuzz with discussions surrounding the implications of the partnership. One account associated with the Crypto.com community clarified that the Mastercard-backed cards would primarily serve the GCC region, where Visa-backed Crypto.com cards are currently unavailable. This move ensures that users in these markets gain access to seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions without disrupting Visa-backed offerings in other regions. Strategic Expansion in the GCC Region Bahrain will serve as the launchpad for Crypto.com’s Mastercard card in January 2025, with plans to expand into other GCC countries, including Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The GCC region is emerging as a hub for blockchain and Web3 innovation, making it an attractive market for cryptocurrency platforms. Governments across the region have shown a strong commitment to fostering fintech and blockchain ecosystems, creating a fertile ground for partnerships like this one. Amnah Ajmal, Mastercard’s Executive Vice President of Market Development, said, “Crypto.com will now have access to our global network, enabling transactions wherever Mastercard is accepted, our innovative payment solutions powered by cutting-edge technology, and our comprehensive tools for enhancing transaction security and fraud protection.” This partnership signals a growing trend of major financial institutions embracing cryptocurrencies, bridging the gap between traditional and digital finance. Mastercard’s decision to integrate with Crypto.com aligns with its broader strategy to expand its presence in the Web3 space, enabling users to transact seamlessly across diverse markets. The move also highlights the competitive dynamic between Mastercard and Visa as both companies seek to secure a foothold in the expanding cryptocurrency payments industry. While Visa has been a long-standing partner of Crypto.com in other regions, the Mastercard-backed cards mark a strategic diversification for Crypto.com in the GCC. The GCC’s progressive regulatory environment and tech-savvy population create ideal conditions for the success of such initiatives. By offering secure, convenient, and reward-rich payment solutions, Crypto.com and Mastercard are likely to drive increased adoption of cryptocurrencies in the region. The Mastercard-Crypto.com partnership is a major milestone in the ongoing evolution of cryptocurrency as a mainstream financial tool. By targeting the GCC region, the collaboration not only taps into a market ripe for innovation but also paves the way for other cryptocurrency exchanges to explore similar ventures. With the rollout beginning in Bahrain in January 2025 and plans to expand to other GCC nations, this initiative could accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions, transforming the financial landscape of the region. Cryptocurrency Trading Volumes Surge to Record $10 Trillion in November Amid Pro-Crypto Sentiment In a related development, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) witnessed an unprecedented surge in trading activity last month, with total volumes across spot and derivatives markets exceeding $10 trillion for the first time, according to a Dec. 3 report from CCData . This milestone represents a more than 100% increase from October’s figures, driven by renewed optimism in the cryptocurrency sector following the US presidential election. The report highlighted that the $10 trillion mark was a significant milestone in the evolution of centralized crypto trading, fueled by positive market sentiment after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Market participants interpreted the election results as a signal for potential regulatory reforms favoring digital assets. CCData attributed the dramatic increase to traders and investors capitalizing on a bullish market environment. The anticipation of a crypto-friendly policy landscape under the new administration spurred an influx of trading activity, with both institutional and retail participants eager to seize the moment. The report noted that spot markets played a pivotal role in the November trading frenzy, with volumes soaring by nearly 130% to $3.4 trillion. Several prominent exchanges recorded all-time high monthly trading volumes: Upbit Bybit Crypto.com Gate.io Bullish Notably, shares of Galaxy Digital, a crypto trading desk, surged by 25% on Nov. 5 as well, marking the firm’s most active trading day of the year. The spike coincided with the market's response to the election results, signaling widespread investor confidence in the potential for industry growth. Crypto derivatives also saw a remarkable uptick, with trading volumes climbing nearly 90% month-over-month to reach almost $7 trillion. The heightened interest in derivatives trading was attributed to the introduction of new products and the expanding role of institutional participants. One key development in November was the launch of Arkham’s digital asset derivatives exchange on Nov. 6. Designed to target retail traders, Arkham’s entry into the market signaled growing competition with established platforms such as Binance. The addition of innovative derivatives offerings underscored the increasing sophistication of crypto markets. Crypto Options Bolster Derivatives Growth Another critical factor in the derivatives boom was the growing popularity of crypto options, particularly those tied to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved the listing of BTC ETF options in September, paving the way for their debut in November on major platforms like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. On Nov. 18, BlackRock’s BTC ETF options achieved nearly $2 billion in exposure on their first trading day. This milestone signaled strong institutional interest and highlighted the potential for Bitcoin to gain further traction as a mainstream financial asset. Investment managers expressed optimism about the role of BTC ETF options in driving institutional adoption. One analyst noted, “The US debut of spot BTC ETF options could unlock extraordinary upside for Bitcoin holders and solidify its position as a critical asset in the modern portfolio.” Options trading, which involves contracts granting the right to buy or sell assets at predetermined prices, has long been a tool for managing risk and leveraging market positions. Its introduction to crypto ETFs represents a significant step forward for the market’s maturation. Looking ahead, the anticipated regulatory clarity under the new US administration could further boost investor confidence. The growing accessibility of innovative financial products, such as BTC ETF options, is likely to enhance institutional participation and drive market liquidity. The $10 trillion trading volume milestone in November is a watershed moment for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and the broader crypto industry. With positive market sentiment fueled by Donald Trump’s election victory, traders and investors have positioned themselves for a new era of pro-crypto policies and increased institutional engagement. As the market continues to evolve, the continued adoption of innovative products like BTC ETF options show the potential for sustained growth and broader acceptance of digital assets. The unprecedented trading volumes in November are not just a reflection of the crypto sector’s current momentum but a glimpse into its promising future.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6395/crypto-com-teams-up-with-mastercard-for-gcc-market-expansion,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37256375,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316677,1733407096,Philippines Central Bank Completes Wholesale CBDC Testing,"On December 5, the Philippines Central Bank announced the completion of its wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) testing. Philippine Central Bank Completes Wholesale CBDC Pilot According to a press release , the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) finalized its Project Agila testing designed to enhance interbank fund transfers. As Cryptonews previously reported, the project was unveiled in March 2024. The initiative utilizes distributed ledger technology (DLT) hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to facilitate secure, round-the-clock transactions between financial institutions. Project Agila tested the system’s functionality, security, and programmability, aiming to improve the efficiency and resilience of the Philippines’ large-value payment infrastructure. Unlike retail CBDCs, which target public use, wholesale CBDCs are tailored for high-value transactions, including interbank settlements and cross-border payments. BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr. underscored the system’s benefits, saying wholesale CBDCs “enhance liquidity management, reduce settlement risks, and support financial stability.” While the BSP has not disclosed specific pilot outcomes, it stated that insights from the initiative will guide its broader digital currency roadmap. The completion of Project Agila reflects the BSP’s broader goal of accelerating the digitization of the country’s financial infrastructure. This aligns with the central bank’s efforts to integrate emerging technologies into the national payment system and enhance financial inclusion. Apple and Google have already met with the BSP about possibly bringing their payment systems in the Philippines, possibly offering consumers with more options for doing their online transactions. Read more here: https://t.co/MfTvBRQzX2 pic.twitter.com/EeCbxuOyT6 — Gadget Pilipinas (@gadgetpilipinas) December 4, 2024 Wholesale CBDCs offer unique advantages over traditional banking methods. By operating beyond business hours, these tokens enable seamless transactions during evenings, weekends, and holidays. They also mitigate settlement risks, improve liquidity management, and simplify cross-border trade. Future Possibilities for the Philippines The BSP joins a growing list of central banks exploring CBDC innovations. Countries like China and Australia have made significant strides in this domain, each focusing on tailored use cases. The People’s Bank of China has expanded its retail CBDC pilot to millions of users, while the Reserve Bank of Australia recently completed wholesale CBDC trials targeting cross-border settlements. Meanwhile, the global outlook on CBDCs is shifting, with central bankers showing reduced enthusiasm for their adoption as 13% of respondents in a survey by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) supported CBDCs as a solution for improving cross-border payments in 2024, a sharp drop from 31% in 2023. Although the BSP has not committed to fully adopting a wholesale CBDC, Project Agila is a critical milestone. The trial’s outcomes are expected to inform future policy decisions, particularly as the central bank evaluates its next steps in digital currency adoption. Governor Remolona emphasized the BSP’s commitment to leveraging insights from the trial. He noted, “Our findings will help us create a stronger, more resilient financial ecosystem while keeping pace with global trends in digital finance.” As the BSP advances digital innovation, it also enhances oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs) . A new reporting portal will launch on January 1, 2025, requiring VASPs to file detailed reports on transaction volumes, asset custody, and user demographics.

37254788,https://invezz.com/?p=2370398,1733406858,Brazil sees surge in Bitcoin ATMs as cryptocurrency adoption grows,"In recent years, Brazil has seen a significant increase in cryptocurrency usage, evidenced by the proliferation of Bitcoin ATMs nationwide. This increase reflects Brazilians’ growing acceptance of digital assets and a shift toward innovative financial technologies. CoinATMRadar data shows nine Bitcoin ATMs in Brazil’s largest cities, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Petrópolis, São Bernardo do Campo, and Bauru. This represents a significant increase from just four ATMs in 2021, demonstrating the rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies by Brazilians. The proliferation of these machines facilitates Bitcoin buying and selling, offering convenience and accessibility often lacking in traditional banking. Coin Cloud is leading the charge for ATM expansion Coin Cloud has played an important role in this ATM expansion, taking substantial steps to improve the availability of Bitcoin ATMs in key urban areas. The company’s plan seeks not just to meet current demand, but also to promote a greater knowledge and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in Brazil. Coin Cloud is well-positioned to boost Brazil’s prominence in the cryptocurrency environment, with plans for additional expansion in the works. Globally, the surge is not exclusive to Brazil. CoinATMRadar claims that there are now over 38,000 Bitcoin ATMs in 67 countries. These ATMs are facilitated by 362 firms and built by 39 different producers, suggesting a strong global interest and investment in Bitcoin infrastructure. This global trend reflects the growing acknowledgement of cryptocurrencies as genuine financial tools, igniting critical debates about their economic impact. Brazil in the Latin American crypto-sphere Brazil’s cryptocurrency infrastructure falls somewhere between its Latin American neighbours. Colombia now leads the region with Bitcoin ATMs, with 46, followed by Panama (17) and Argentina (13). This background exposes an intriguing dynamic, implying that, while Brazil has made tremendous progress in embracing Bitcoin ATMs, there is still enormous space for expansion, especially when examined through the perspective of regional peers. Despite lagging in terms of overall ATM numbers, Brazil is undergoing a significant cultural movement toward Bitcoin acceptance. The expanding number of Bitcoin ATMs shows not just an increase in digital asset usage, but also changing customer behaviour and attitudes toward financial technology. As cryptocurrencies become more widespread, more Brazilians are expected to include them in their financial portfolios. Future outlook for cryptocurrency adoption in Brazil The popularity of Bitcoin ATMs in Brazil is expected to expand even more as demand for cryptocurrency rises. This predicted rise is driven by a younger, tech-savvy population, more knowledge of financial technology, and a general demand for alternatives to traditional banking systems. The accessibility of Bitcoin ATMs will only help to further establish cryptocurrencies in the Brazilian economy. Furthermore, as educational programs surrounding cryptocurrencies increase, more Brazilians are likely to regard Bitcoin and other digital assets as legitimate means of conducting transactions rather than speculative speculations. This cultural shift could accelerate the development of a more robust cryptocurrency ecosystem in Brazil, benefiting both consumers and companies. Overall, the proliferation of Bitcoin ATMs around Brazil represents the beginning of a fundamental shift in how cryptocurrencies are seen and used in the country. While problems persist, the favourable trajectory shows that Brazil is on the verge of a broader financial technology revolution, one that has the potential to redefine economic participation for millions of its inhabitants in the years ahead.

While some analysts expect a pullback or a sideways movement from here, some analysts expect the rise to continue. At this point, Nick Forster, founder of decentralized options protocol Derive, said that he does not expect BTC to move sideways around $ 100,000 for a long time. Forster said that breaking the $100,000 psychological price barrier would attract more interest and push the price higher. “I don't think we're likely to see much consolidation around 100,000. I expect the rally to continue. Because breaking $100,000 will attract new participants to the market and change the minds of existing investors. This also points to more volatility and potential upside.” The analyst also stated that investors may turn to altcoins from now on, predicting that there may be a further return to Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins. “ETH has been lagging the market so far. But I expect that to change now. As a reminder, ETH has historically outperformed Bitcoin after reaching previous all-time highs or major milestones,” Forster said. *This is not investment advice.

37254446,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373511,1733406598,BlackRock’s IBIT Becomes Fastest ETF in History to Hit $50B in AUM,"BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), launched on January 11, has become the fastest exchange-traded fund (ETF) to reach $50 billion in assets under management (AUM). Data from SosoValue shows that IBIT currently has $50.60 billion in AUM. The AUM refers to the total value of Bitcoin managed by the fund. In the context of a spot Bitcoin ETF, the AUM is directly tied to the value of the BTC held by the ETF, as it aims to mirror the price movements of the digital asset in the spot market. Five-Times Faster According to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , it took IBIT only 228 days to reach this milestone, adding that the previous record holder, BlackRock’s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA), took 1,329 days to achieve the same. This means that IBIT achieved this feat 5x faster than any ETF ever launched. Among the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January, BlackRock’s IBIT has continued to outperform others in multiple metrics. Within five months of its release, it surpassed the pre-existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in AUM. IBIT is also the highest in terms of historical net inflows. On its most recent trading day (December 4), the fund pulled in the highest inflow amongst its peers, totaling $571.71 million. This took its historical net inflow to a staggering $33.34 billion, according to Sosovalue. Increasing Institutional Investment in Bitcoin IBIT’s rapid growth reflects heightened investor confidence in Bitcoin exposure via traditional financial instruments. Moreover, the approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs have driven increased institutional investment in BTC. As of the time of writing, the total net asset value (NAV) of spot Bitcoin ETFs stands at $108.23 billion, representing 5.54% of Bitcoin’s market value. The fund’s historical cumulative net inflow has crossed $32.29 billion. Meanwhile, the heightened activity around these ETFs coincides with a significant upsurge in the price of BTC. The original cryptocurrency rose 6% to hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $103,679 earlier Thursday.

The optimism saw metaverse tokens extending their gains , with Sandbox (SAND) outshining. Consecutive gains throughout the previous month saw SAND surpassing $1 to explore $1.0616 during Wednesday’s late session. The impressive price increase, up 60% and 310% in the past week and month, has made many Sandbox investors profitable. IntoTheBlock data shows that 50% of SAND holders are making money at current prices. Meanwhile, 38% experience losses while 12% are at break even. Source: IntoTheBlock SAND price at new highs The altcoin painted its daily chart green after climbing from the opening price of $0.8784 to $1.0616. SAND trades at $0.95 after cooling from its latest high, but everything seemingly points to more gains. Source: Coinmarketcap The 90% surge in daily trading volume to $3.80 billion confirms massive trader optimism behind Sandbox’s performance. Technical indicators support the bullish stance for SAND. The 50 and 200-day exponential moving averages form a golden cross in the 1D timeframe, confirming robust bullishness in play. Furthermore, stability above the $0.90 support sets the stage for impressive upswings. The altcoin will likely recapture $1.07 and extend toward $1.250. Such sentiments will likely trigger more uptrends for SAND, opening the path to the $1.50 target. That would result in a 58% upsurge from prevailing prices. On-chain data supports extended surges On-chain stats further add to SAND’s improving bullish stance. Net network growth shows a 0.80% increase, indicating heightened investor activity, which could attract significant demand. Furthermore, nearly 4% of transactions were profitable at press time, confirming that most Sandbox investors were profitable. Such trends often lead to amplified buying momentum. Also, large transactions have surged 12.06%, suggesting accumulating by whales or institutional players. That reflects confidence in SAND’s upcoming price movements. Last but not least, the 0.07% concentration shows a significant number of wallets control SAND’s supply. That could moderate volatility if whales decide to offload. Source: IntoTheBlock SAND exhibits bullish indicators, supporting the upward narrative to$1.50. Broad market sentiments align with SAND’s anticipated surge. The Altcoin Season Index explores yearly peaks, currently at 87/100 ( Coinmarketcap data ). That means 87 of the top 100 digital assets by market cap have outperformed Bitcoin within a 3-month timeframe. Scores above 75 suggest an altcoin season, whereas 25 and below indicate a BTC season. The current readings show the market is in an alt season. The previous altcoin season, in HI 2021, saw the top 100 alts skyrocketing by 174%, while Bitcoin gained only 2%. Analysts expect such trends in the upcoming weeks or months, conditions which would see SAND hitting its targets and printing new ATHs.

While market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant forces, there’s a new player catching the attention of crypto whales— Lightchain AI . Yes, Bitcoin and Ethereum whales are turning their gaze to this emerging blockchain, and for good reason! With its cutting-edge Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and AI Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain is redefining how blockchain and AI intersect. But what’s fueling this sudden surge of interest, and does it live up to the hype among big investors? Why Crypto Whales Are Betting on Lightchain Whales—the influential mega-holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)—are known for their role in shaping market trends. And right now, their wallets are making waves toward Lightchain AI tokens. Why is this happening? It's all about utility, innovation, and timing. Firstly, Lightchain AI’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) brings a major evolutionary leap in consensus mechanisms. Unlike Proof of Work (PoW), which consumes vast amounts of energy, or Proof of Stake (PoS), which focuses on asset holdings, PoI rewards nodes for completing AI-driven computations. This ensures computational resources are used meaningfully while maintaining network security. Whales are enamored by this efficiency—where value is derived from task contribution, not just capital. Secondly, the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) is a game-changer. It goes beyond static applications, allowing developers to leverage AI for dynamic decision-making within decentralized applications (dApps). This is not merely futuristic—it’s practical and opens massive opportunities for AI-based applications in finance, logistics, and even gaming. To leading investors, this represents a tangible edge over other blockchains that have solely focused on scalability or ecosystem strength without innovating in computation. Lastly? Timing is everything in the blockchain universe. Lightchain AI’s Stage 6 Pre-sale is still tantalizingly low-cost at $0.003 per token. With over $1 million already raised, early adoption incentives are drawing in the big players, including those eyeing long-term profits. Lightchain AI’s Unique Position Compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum Bitcoin is the fortress for storing value. Ethereum, with its revolutionary smart contract ecosystem, remains the foundation for most modern blockchains and DeFi. But neither one is specifically designed for artificial intelligence integration—which is where Lightchain AI comes into play. Here’s how Lightchain sets itself apart: Efficiency Without Compromise – Bitcoin’s PoW is secure but inefficient. Lightchain’s PoI achieves security while driving meaningful innovation through required AI workloads. AI-First Blockchain – Ethereum developers rely on layer-2 scaling solutions to expand use cases. Meanwhile, Lightchain positions AI as a foundational layer through its AIVM. Privacy & Scalability – AI-driven decentralized systems, coupled with Lightchain’s privacy features, appeal particularly to enterprise adoption—a potentially billion-dollar niche. Investors are recognizing this; the whales are shifting part of their focus to blockchains like Lightchain that offer entirely new functionality beyond traditional financial setups. What Analysts Are Saying About Lightchain AI Some analysts have noted that Lightchain AI might still be in its infancy, with its mainnet expected to achieve full activation next year. However, early adoption by whales suggests confidence in the long-term value proposition of this ecosystem. “It’s rare to see a blockchain that merges two thriving sectors—AI and decentralized technology—so effectively,” said one industry expert. “Blockchain tech has often lagged behind AI developments, but Lightchain AI bridges that gap seamlessly, and big investors know exactly what that means.” Of course, hype isn’t new to crypto, and skeptics remain cautious. They suggest that only time will reveal whether Lightchain can maintain momentum as it scales. Nevertheless, early fundraising success and growing developer interest indicate that this is more than your average speculative project. The Energy on Social Channels 🌐 Beyond whale wallets, social media platforms have erupted with enthusiasm for Lightchain AI. Influencers and communities on Telegram and X (formerly Twitter) are rallying around the hashtag #LightchainAI. Many cite the blockchain’s decentralized governance framework as a key draw for grassroots adoption. It creates pathways for every token holder to help steer the ecosystem—a democratized approach that fosters loyalty and collaboration. Telegram communities like Lightchain Protocol AI already boast thousands of active participants sharing investment strategies, development progress, and ecosystem updates. Is Lightchain AI the Next Big Thing? While it’s too early to say if Lightchain AI will reach the same market dominance as Bitcoin or Ethereum, one thing is clear—it’s rapidly gaining attention and credibility within the crypto space. With its revolutionary integration of AI and blockchain, along with an innovative consensus model, Lightchain AI ticks multiple boxes for both retail investors and whales looking for the next big opportunity. Whether you’re an experienced Ethereum trader or venturing into blockchain for the first time, Lightchain AI represents a unique prospect to watch closely. Its combination of innovation, scalability, and privacy isn’t something we’ve seen on this scale before. If you're intrigued by what Lightchain AI has to offer, why not explore deeper?

A few days after the Bitcoin spot ETF achieved a major milestone, one of the issuers has made headlines today. For context, the investment products are now on the verge of surpassing the amount of Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto owns.Today, Bloomberg’s senior analyst Eric Balchunas confirmed that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has reached $50 billion in net assets under management. A scintillating detail in this feat is the fund’s record time.Notably, the BlackRock Bitcoin spot product reached $50 billion in assets in 228 days, beating the previous fastest record by a wide margin. Balchunas stated that the last holder of this record hit the milestone in 1,329 days, a period surpassing BlackRock’s timeframe by a staggering fivefold.BlackRock Records Ridiculous FiguresMeanwhile, BlackRock’s impressive feat came amidst a substantial inflow on Wednesday. The fund recorded a single-day inflow of $571.71 million, trouncing the flows of other asset managers.With the inflows yesterday, the IBIT's net asset increased to $50.59 billion and its cumulative net inflow to $33.34 billion, data from Sosovalue shows. Meanwhile, the US Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $556.82 million yesterday, bringing their total net asset to $108.23 billion.Notably, BlackRock has seen ridiculous figures since its market debut on January 11. Its incessant inflows ensured it became one of the best-performing ETFs in the last decade.Furthermore, the BlackRock Bitcoin fund also trumped its gold ETF in less than one year of market debut. It bears mentioning that the BlackRock iShares Gold Trust (IAU) has existed since 2005 and is still miles shy of the $50 billion AUM.Bitcoin Pent-up Demand Spurring BlackRock’s Asset UptickMeanwhile, BlackRock’s Bitcoin success mirrors a pent-up demand for the ETFs since their early-year launch. Although the funds struggled at one point this year, Donald Trump’s November 5 election win has rekindled investors' interest in Bitcoin and products providing exposure to the asset.Notably, the inflows have spurred Bitcoin to an unprecedented price high of over $103,000 today.

37257491,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107314,1733405990,Altcoin Season Index Remains Unchanged at 87: What It Means for the Market,"The Altcoin Season Index maintained its position at 87 as of 00:30 UTC on December 5, according to data from cryptocurrency price tracker CoinMarketCap (CMC). This unchanged score confirms that the market is firmly in Altcoin Season , where a significant majority of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index, which tracks the performance of the top 100 coins excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, provides valuable insight into market trends, helping investors gauge whether altcoins or Bitcoin dominate the market. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index How the Index Works The Altcoin Season Index assigns a score ranging from 1 to 100 , with daily updates reflecting changes in market performance. Altcoin Season (Score > 75): At least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Bitcoin Season (Score Fewer than 25% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin. The current score of 87 highlights that altcoins are significantly outpacing Bitcoin , signaling strong investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. Factors Driving Altcoin Season Several factors contribute to the current Altcoin Season: 1. Diversification by Investors As Bitcoin reaches all-time highs, many investors are shifting focus to altcoins for higher potential returns. 2.

Layer-2 Scaling Solutions Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB) have gained traction as they offer scalable solutions for Ethereum-based projects, enhancing their appeal among developers and investors alike. Implications of a Prolonged Altcoin Season The continued dominance of altcoins has several implications for the broader cryptocurrency market: 1. Increased Market Volatility Altcoins tend to exhibit higher price volatility compared to Bitcoin, leading to rapid gains or losses. Investors should remain cautious and manage risks effectively. 2. Broader Ecosystem Growth Altcoin Season often coincides with the development and adoption of new blockchain technologies, which can expand the overall market. 3.

Raoul Pal’s Strategy for Investors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is buzzing as Bitcoin stabilizes and altcoins surge, marking what many are calling “altcoin season.” Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision , recently shared his views on the ongoing bull run and how investors can navigate the market’s ups and downs. While Bitcoin remains a key player, Pal notes that altcoins with strong communities are experiencing remarkable growth. Bitcoin Stalls Below $102K: What It Means for Investors Bitcoin’s price has been hovering below $102,000, frustrating investors who expected it to climb higher. Despite a 38% rise over the past month, analysts caution that extended consolidation could push prices lower. Pal acknowledges these risks but points out Bitcoin’s resilience, emphasizing continued interest from institutional players. Companies like MicroStrategy and Marathon Digital are still buying large amounts of Bitcoin, underscoring its role as a market staple. On the other hand, Ethereum has been outperforming Bitcoin recently, with its market cap steadily rising. However, Pal is cautious about the volatility of altcoins. The Meme Coin Craze Meme coins like Dogecoin and Bonk have captured attention, driven by their passionate communities. However, Pal is cautious about their long-term potential. He explains that these coins often thrive on hype rather than substance, with price surges that can quickly reverse. “These tokens rely on the ‘attention game,’” Pal says, comparing investing in meme coins to playing “hot potato.” The last investors in are often left holding tokens that rapidly lose value once the hype fades. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Attention Traders: Do Not Miss the 30% Rise of This Dwindling Altcoin in December 2024 , Raoul Pal Investing Strategy For those who want to participate in the altcoin frenzy, Pal recommends a balanced approach. He suggests putting the majority of one’s funds into more established tokens like Ethereum and Bitcoin while using a smaller portion to experiment with riskier assets like meme coins. This strategy allows investors to gain exposure to potential gains without risking their entire investment. However, in the coming weeks, it will be interesting to see whether Bitcoin regains its dominance or if altcoins continue to lead the charge. FAQs Are meme coins a good investment during altcoin season? Meme coins like Dogecoin are highly speculative and risky. Raoul Pal advises caution, as their value is driven by hype, not fundamentals. Is Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in 2024? Yes, Ethereum has recently outpaced Bitcoin in market cap growth, but Bitcoin remains a key player in the market. How should I invest in altcoins during the current bull run? Pal recommends investing mainly in established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a small portion in riskier altcoins or meme coins.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | ETH | MARKET,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-altcoin-season-here-to-stay-raoul-pals-take-on-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The integration is the first stage of On-Chain Yield for Binance Earn, which may expand to additional products and chains. The new on-chain reward mechanism will be listed under Binance’s High Yield tab and will come with a warning. The difference for end users is that they will be able to use their Binance account directly to participate in multiple protocols offering on-chain yields. Binance Earn will save them from holding multiple wallets and staking accounts. However, in some cases, the Binance account wallet will not support a particular airdrop. In that case, a user still needs to share a self-custodial wallet address to receive the specific rewards. The earning service will open on December 9 with a 1,000 BTC cap. Each user will be limited to a stake between 0.5 BTC and 5 BTC. Binance will also release more details for on-chain yield from next week. On-chain yield will tap multiple projects requiring direct participation. However, users will only access their Binance accounts and may be able to earn points, tokens, or other rewards. Binance may also offer an immediate schedule for redeeming the earnings. In the case of Babylon Labs, BTC staking is done in exchange for points. The points themselves have no market value at the moment and are accumulated in anticipation of a future airdrop. Binance Earn warns that its on-chain yield products are riskier than usual and do not guarantee a positive market value. Binance Earn has not set out the details of handling point allocations or airdrops. Babylon Labs prepares for its Cap-3 event Outside of Binance Earn, Babylon Labs is preparing for its third staking event, Cap-3. The event will arrive a few days after BTC broke the $100K mark for the first time, driving additional enthusiasm for the leading crypto coin. Holders of BTC wallets can join the lockup session, directly locking a predetermined amount of coins. The coins never leave the wallet, but they cannot be unstaked without incurring additional fees. Babylon Labs has already run two lockup sessions for a timed duration and with a 500 BTC limit for whales. The initial sessions were short, lasting just 10 BTC blocks. Cap-3 will be open for 1,000 BTC blocks, which is roughly one week. The session will have a minimum of 0.005 BTC and an increased maximum of 5,000 BTC. Unbounding BTC that is locked before or after the cap event will have a fee of 0.00032 BTC. Releasing coins will also incur the same fee. The event will start awarding points based on the BTC locked in each block. For the first 300 blocks, Babylon Labs will award 100,000 points per block. For the remaining 700 blocks, the allocation will be 21,000 points. The point allocations may not be eligible for an airdrop for jurisdictions outside the USA. The Binance Earn Babylon staking will open a day before the actual on-chain event. Babylon Labs will start its session on December 10, at 11 AM UTC, with enough time for Binance to join on behalf of its depositors. Babylon Labs boosts BTC DeFi Sector Babylon Labs has goals of creating a DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin using derivative tokens that tap the growing value without selling the coins. The Bitcoin DeFi summer did not materialize, as most BTC staking products were still niche. However, Babylon Labs is fast becoming the most widely adopted tool for tapping BTC value. The total value locked in BTC-based products reached a peak at $3.79B. Of that value, Babylon Labs carries $2.38B based on its two previous lockup rounds. Babylon Labs is among the first to offer direct on-chain, non-custodial staking, immediately surpassing the value of Ethereum-based protocols using wrapped BTC. The project aims to continue creating liquidity and building its own DeFi ecosystem.

37253904,https://crypto.news/?p=14316506,1733405442,How high can the Dogecoin price get by December 31?,"Dogecoin price has moved into a consolidation phase near the year-to-date high of $0.4795. Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the largest meme coin based on market capitalization, was trading at the psychological level of $0.4500 on Dec. 5. It has jumped by 450% from its lowest level this year, bringing its market cap to over $65 billion. Analysts are optimistic that the ongoing consolidation could be the calm before the storm before the coin jumps to $1. In an X post , World of Charts noted that the coin may soon have a strong bullish breakout in the next few days. A likely catalyst for the DOGE price will be the ongoing Bitcoin ( BTC ) rally now that it has crossed the key resistance at $100,000 . By moving above that level, there are odds that many institutional investors and companies will start buying the coin. Higher BTC prices often lead to more interest in low-priced meme coins. Dogecoin price may also soar because of the ongoing sense of greed in the crypto industry. Data shows that the crypto fear and greed index has jumped to the extreme greed zone of 85. Also, the altcoin season index has continued rising, which will spur more demand for the coin. Dogecoin price will also benefit from the ongoing acquisitions by whales. Recent data shows that some whales have continued to accumulate the coin. Data by ClankApp shows that whales moved coins worth over $3 million on Dec. 5.

It has moved above the 50-week and 200-week moving averages. Dogecoin is also approaching the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. However, the coin is forming a small rising wedge chart pattern, a potentially dangerous pattern. Therefore, there is a risk that it will drop and potentially retest the support at $0.40 and then resume the bullish trend. More gains will be confirmed if bulls move above the year-to-date high of $0.4795. If this happens, the coin may jump to an all-time high of $0.7363 by December 31. Such a move would signal a 65% upside from the current level. Investors would then eye a move to the coveted $1 level in this bull run. A move below the key support at $0.35 will invalidate the bullish view and put it at risk of falling to $0.2265, the highest point in April this year.

37253854,https://finbold.com/?p=217003,1733405322,Why XRP price is crashing,"After experiencing one of the most remarkable non-meme coin cryptocurrency market rallies of 2024, XRP has entered into a steep crash in the daily chart. Indeed, trading at $2.37, the token has dropped by a significant 7.56% in the last 24 hours. The fall only becomes starker once the fact that on December 3 – just two days before – XRP stood at $2.82, as it indicates a total collapse of 16% from the recent highs. XRP 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold Still, the sudden downward shift is, perhaps, not surprising as the recent rally ensured the cryptocurrency’s relative strength index ( RSI ) crossed above 70, signaling it is significantly overbought. Such a setup has made the token susceptible to various potential shocks, and two major events have shaken XRP in the last two days. Why XRP entered a significant correction Specifically, the first drop from November 3 highs came as South Korea’s president unexpectedly declared martial law and, effectively, attempted to dissolve parliament in a move now investigated as treason . Still, Wednesday’s downturn was as brief as the heated phase of the political crisis in the East Asian country. More recently, however, XRP may have been impacted by the rumor that the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is imminent. Some high-profile individuals, such as Tron founder Justin Sun, also drove the speculation mill. However, Ripple’s own statement on X – the one clarifying that the stablecoin has not yet received approval – proved a major blow to the XRP rally. Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible. We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards. Stay tuned… — Ripple (@Ripple) December 4, 2024 Still, looking at the 24-hour chart and the timing of the post revealing RLUSD is not, in fact, coming on December 4, the news appears to have halted recovery far more than triggered the downturn. Ultimately, it is most likely that XRP’s ongoing decline is the result of a broader set of factors, particularly as technical analysis ( TA ) conducted earlier on Wednesday and reported by Finbold strongly hinted that a major correction is imminent. The uncertainty could have also been driven by speculation that the token’s price surge is ‘not natural’ and a sign of a ‘pump and dump’ that started gaining traction on December 4. Can Ripple regain upward momentum in December? Finally, as dire as the December 5 decline might appear for XRP, it is worth pointing out that the cryptocurrency remains an impressive 62.36% in the green in the last week and 376.52% in the last 30 days. XRP 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold The token could also soon benefit from external news. Specifically, much like part of XRP’s price explosion was spurred on by the news Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler will be resigning on January 20, so could the revelation Donald Trump nominated the cryptocurrency lobbying Paul Atkins as his replacement. Such a scenario could be particularly plausible once the fact that Bitcoin ( BTC ) likely caused a significant shift of funds away from altcoins once it broke above the long-awaited $100,000 , and the move is likely to be reversed should BTC experience a deep correction or stagnate before advancing further.

With its growing momentum and DeFi dominance, ETH remains a top contender in the crypto space. However, all eyes are on PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a real estate tokenization platform. As the Ethereum price kicks into higher gear, PropiChain is gaining traction during its token presale. At its lowest-ever price of $0.004 per PCHAIN token, PropiChain offers an attractive entry point for long-term holders. These two altcoins could represent the best of both worlds. With the Ethereum price rising slowly, ETH is a good investment for investors looking for stability and steady growth. On the other hand, the RWA altcoin represents new gems with unlimited potential. Could PropiChain’s growth rival Ethereum’s success? Will The Ethereum Price Cross the $5K Mark? The Ethereum price has shown strong momentum, even though it hasn’t managed to break the $4,000 resistance. Currently trading at $3,622.04, the Ethereum price rallied 44% in 30 days. This has left investors wondering if the Ethereum price has the momentum to set a new record above $5K. Ethereum has a lot going for it. The layer-1 network accounts for over half of the total value locked in TVL. More importantly, the Ethereum price could reach $5K as institutional capital flows into ETH. Spot Ethereum ETF in the U.S. attracted $333 million in net inflows in a single trading session. This is great news for the Ethereum price. PropiChain: RWA Altcoin Projected to Rally 45,000% Analysts are forecasting a 45,000% rally for PropiChain. The PCHAIN is on course for an 800% surge during the several rounds of token presale. From round 1 to round 2, early backers of the RWA altcoin could see gains exceeding 200%. Staking rewards are adding another layer of attraction for crypto enthusiasts. PropiChain staking rewards of up to 225% APR offer a good opportunity to earn passive income. This creates multiple revenue streams for long-term PCHAIN holders. Real estate tokenization stands at the heart of PropiChain’s platform. Fractional ownership makes property investments accessible to retail traders. Real estate fractional ownership makes wealth creation more inclusive and transparent. PropiChains turns to the metaverse for virtual property tours. This allows potential investors to view properties globally from their living rooms. Detailed 3D environments provide immersive experiences that traditional listings can’t match. This feature saves property scouting costs. Smart contracts are used to automate real estate transactions. This simplifies lease renewals, payment tracking, and tenant verification processes. PropiChain has its smart contracts independently audited by BlockAudit, a leading blockchain security firm, to ensure that its smart contracts are safe for users and investors. PropiChain uses artificial intelligence for AI chatbots for round-the-clock communication, predictive market analysis, and advanced search filters. Ethereum vs PCHAIN In the best-case scenario, the Ethereum price will reach $5,000, indicating a 38% from the current level. However, analysts believe the Ethereum price will reach $7,000 if the DeFi sector picks up. At the same time, PropiChain could be regarded as a better investment option due to its potential. The RWA altcoin can surge by 45,000%, but investors will first want to see it skyrocket by more than 800% during the presale. Conclusion PropiChain is regarded as one of the best new altcoins to invest in. Analysts claim the RWA altcoin has the momentum to rise more than 800% in the token offering. Its low price of $0.004 makes it the best favorite for new and experienced investors. PropiChain has its smart contract independently audited by a third-party security firm, BlockAudit. The project has already secured a CoinMarketCap listing , underscoring its commitment to growth. The team is indicating that these are early days. There is more to come for users and investors. Take advantage of PropiChain’s lowest-ever price. Join PropiChain’s presale to earn 45,000% profits and turn $1,000 into $450,000.

These platforms have revolutionized blockchain development, enabling decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and scalable networks. However, they also come with limitations. Scalability Issues (Hello, Ethereum Gas Fees): Ethereum, in particular, has been haunted by its congestion difficulties and high transaction fees. Energy Consumption (Ahem, Proof of Work): Despite movement toward Proof of Stake (PoS), the conversation around environmental sustainability is far from resolved. Rigidity in AI Integration (Not Built for Intelligence): None of these platforms seamlessly integrates AI—a technology poised to dominate the coming decade. Enter Lightchain Protocol AI. By focusing on AI-driven computation and adaptive scalability , Lightchain offers solutions that not only address these pain points but also open new possibilities for decentralized innovation. What Is Lightchain Protocol AI? At its core, Lightchain Protocol is more than a blockchain—it’s an entirely new ecosystem. Designed to merge artificial intelligence and blockchain technology , Lightchain enables scalable, secure, and privacy-focused decentralized systems for industries ranging from finance to healthcare. Thanks to its cutting-edge innovations like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) mechanism and AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) , this protocol promises to redefine what blockchain can achieve. Key Features That Set Lightchain Apart: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Unlike Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), PoI incentivizes valuable AI computation. Picture this—rewarding nodes for AI model training and optimization tasks, rather than pointless computations. AI Virtual Machine (AIVM): The AIVM introduces revolutionary scalability by enabling developers to deploy AI-specific tasks directly on the blockchain. Transparent AI Framework: An auditable and accountable system ensuring complete trust in AI-driven operations. Simply put, Lightchain is designed to turn the blockchain into an intelligent, decentralized network capable of executing AI tasks seamlessly. Applications of Lightchain Protocol AI 1. Revolutionizing Finance and DeFi Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is already a game-changer, but integrating Lightchain’s PoI could take it further. Its AI-powered tools can enable smarter contract execution, fraud detection in real-time, and predictive analytics for market trends. Say goodbye to basic DeFi tools stuck in the past! 2. Transforming dApps Lightchain unlocks the ability to create AI-based decentralized applications (dApps). For example, imagine a decentralized AI-powered marketplace that suggests the perfect product for you—not through traditional e-commerce algorithms, but through pure blockchain-based intelligence. 3. Healthcare on the Blockchain Healthcare presents a unique challenge due to confidentiality and high data processing needs. Thanks to AIVM, advanced AI algorithms can process healthcare data securely, paving the way for early disease detection models while ensuring privacy compliance. 4. Gaming and Virtual Worlds Welcome to the next level of GameFi! With Lightchain, gaming developers can implement real-time AI computations, creating immersive, intelligent in-game environments. Think massive, decentralized MMORPGs where AI adapts to players dynamically. 5. Supply Chain Analytics Blockchain has often been heralded as a savior for supply chain transparency. Now, imagine adding AI to analyze data flows, predict disruptions, and optimize logistics in real-time. Lightchain makes this not only possible but seamless. Breaking Down Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) You might be wondering, “What exactly makes Proof of Intelligence (PoI) so special?” Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms that reward miners or validators based on power or participation, PoI rewards value-added tasks . Nodes could be performing machine learning computations, training neural networks, or running inference models—and receiving Lightchain tokens as compensation. This model eliminates inefficiency by aligning rewards with productivity. Then there’s the AI Virtual Machine —a computational layer designed to execute AI-specific tasks on-chain. By collaborating with a global developer community, the AIVM continuously evolves, enabling seamless integration for cutting-edge AI applications. It’s like combining the mind of an AI strategist with the decentralized freedom of blockchain pioneers. Why Investors Should Pay Attention Market-Driven Growth: With AI and blockchain valued at over $1 trillion, Lightchain operates at the nexus of two rapidly growing markets. Sustainability First: PoI and AIVM emphasize reducing energy consumption while maximizing productivity—an attractive proposition for socially-conscious investors. Massive AI Potential: By bringing AI computations into blockchain ecosystems, Lightchain addresses a major gap in decentralized technology. 🚀 Pro Tip for Early Adopters: The presale is currently live at just $0.003 per LCAI token . Based on projected growth and partnerships, this could be blockchain’s next unicorn.

42416919,ed05c538-5090-4552-bf6c-975fa082b014,1733404500,Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries Are All the Rage. Now XRP?,"Worksport (WKSP), a tiny Nasdaq-listed maker of covers for pickup truck beds, has added its own twist to the newly popular corporate strategy of buying bitcoin that was introduced and made famous by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR).    The New York-based company, which has a $20 million market capitalization, is investing up to 10% of its cash reserves into bitcoin (BTC) and also Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP (XRP). At present, that equates to up to $5 million.    This shift is intended to protect the company’s assets against inflation and to enhance transaction efficiency, the company said.    Since Donald Trump's election a month ago, at least a dozen other companies have announced they plan to stash extra cash in bitcoin. But Worksport's embrace of XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is different.    “I think that XRP is becoming a much more stabilized currency and asset and [...] while I think that over the next little while, it’ll be volatile like most assets are, we think that it’ll be stable enough and bring value enough for us to build parts in cash there and enjoy some upside potential,” Steven Rossi, founder and CEO of Worksport, said during an interview.    Rossi has personally invested in XRP for a few years, he told CoinDesk, and believes that it is crucial for businesses to own decentralized assets.    ""When I saw my wallet and I saw that XRP has been doing quite well recently, I was pleasantly surprised, and it reaffirmed that … these [are] early assets that really challenge central banking,"" he said.    Many companies that have previously announced plans to diversify their Treasury reserves have seen their stock rally shortly after — even before they spend a dime on bitcoin.    Worksport's stock price has fallen 65% over the past five years.    “The market for small issuers like us has been kind of a lagger,” Rossi said. “We obviously expect the market to react as it will positively or negatively [...] but as a cash-generating business like us … we’re less reliant on stock price for survival like some issuers.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/04/corporate-bitcoin-treasuries-are-all-the-rage-now-xrp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f9d11c6b53a48fe1e9a3281e2725d64c3840af4-3840x2152.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Yet, investors might wonder how far the king of cryptocurrencies can actually go. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart The daily chart shows that Bitcoin has finally broken through the 100K milestone today and is pushing toward the $105K level. With the market structure being so bullish, even a run toward the $120K area is possible in the short term. Meanwhile, the RSI has once again entered the overbought region, and the 200-day moving average is also far behind the price, currently trending near the $70K mark. Therefore, there’s also a logical probability for a correction soon, which could present a buying opportunity. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart clearly shows the BTC price action over the last month. The market slowed down after breaking above the $90K resistance level, gradually increasing through higher highs and lows. However, today’s breakout above $100K might lead to an aggressive continuation higher. Meanwhile, with the RSI also entering the overbought zone in this timeframe, there is more evidence that a pullback might happen soon, which could see the price drop toward the bullish trendline and the $96K level before taking off again. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Funding Rates As the futures market is arguably the most significant determining factor in Bitcoin’s short-term price movements, analyzing its overall sentiment would likely help investors form more accurate predictions. This chart presents the funding rates, which measure whether buyers or sellers are executing their leveraged positions more aggressively. While the metric is currently positive, indicating bullish momentum, this can also lead to a potential reversal. High funding rates are usually followed by a sudden drop as a result of long liquidation cascades. With Bitcoin’s aggregate funding rates showing the highest level over the past year, a correction seems likely soon. This could also lead to a period of consolidation as the futures market cools down.

Chainalysis is a major provider of crypto compliance software to governments and corporations that want to know where their digital money is flowing. Its various tools peel back the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrencies.  Demand for such services is only likely to grow if the incoming U.S. administration's pro-crypto talk sparks a wider adoption boom, said Levin, the company's former chief strategy officer.  ""What the company needs right now, given all of the excitement in the market and the strong financial position of Chainalysis, is to be a market leader for our customers and to take bets on broadening the platform,"" Levin said.  Levin co-founded Chainalysis with Gronager in 2014. He declined to elaborate on the reasons behind his counterpart's departure, saying only that the board and Gronager agreed it was time for a change. Chainalysis' president Sari Granat had been serving as interim CEO.  Gronager's now-vacant board seat is being filled by Paul Auvil, a longtime tech and finance executive who will serve as an independent director and chair of the audit committee.  Private companies often stock their boards with independent directors before filing for an initial public offering, which is a prerequisite for getting listed on the major American stock exchanges. Chainalysis has raised money in numerous funding rounds from venture backers who may not see their payday until they have access to the liquidity that comes with public markets.

The collaboration introduces advanced custody services and CeDeFi opportunities for EOS token holders, enabling institutional players to securely participate in the growing EOS ecosystem. The partnership reflects a broader trend of rising institutional adoption as enterprises arrive onchain now that compliant solutions are widely available. By integrating with Ceffu , the EOS Network Foundation (ENF) aims to provide institutions with secure and seamless access to blockchain-based financial services, combining the best aspects of centralized and decentralized finance. Elevating Custody Standards for EOS Assets Ceffu’s custody services are built with institutional needs in mind, offering a suite of solutions designed for security and compliance. Using multi-party computation (MPC) technology and customizable approval schemes, Ceffu ensures that institutional clients can securely store and manage their EOS assets. The integration with Ceffu also allows EOS token-holders to benefit from MirrorX , an off-exchange settlement solution powered by Binance. Incorporating Binance’s liquidity ecosystem via MirrorX means that EOS holders can unlock yield strategies that were previously difficult to access. This includes opportunities to generate returns through staking, liquidity pools, and other decentralized mechanisms, all while benefiting from Ceffu’s secure custody solutions. MirrorX provides a secure gateway for institutions to access Binance’s liquidity and trading mechanisms without transferring funds to the exchange itself. This setup minimizes risks while enabling advanced CeDeFi strategies such as yield generation and liquidity provisioning. Commenting on the partnership, EOS Network Foundation CEO Yves La Rose said: “Ceffu’s integration with EOS represents an important step in building the infrastructure necessary to support institutional engagement at scale. By partnering with Ceffu, we are creating new pathways for institutions to securely participate in the EOS ecosystem and benefit from its evolving opportunities.” EOS Builds Institutional Momentum The partnership with Ceffu is part of a broader effort by EOS to attract institutional players. The inclusion of EOS in Coinbase’s COIN50 Index, which tracks the top 50 digital assets on Coinbase, underscores the network’s growing appeal among institutional investors. In addition to courting institutional capital, EOS has recently implemented several community-driven enhancements to strengthen its ecosystem. These include a $450 million staking rewards program that has quadrupled staking participation while extending lockup periods from 4 to 28 days. It’s also introduced middleware funding initiatives designed to streamline developer onboarding through tools like the Unicove portal, which simplifies access to the network and improves user experience. Why Institutional Adoption Matters for EOS Institutional participation is increasingly recognized as a driver of blockchain adoption and deeper liquidity, bringing not only capital but also long-term credibility to the space. The partnership with Ceffu positions EOS to capture this momentum, offering institutions a secure and scalable platform for engaging with blockchain-based financial services. EOS network can make a strong claim to being well suited to meet institutional demands thanks to the EOS VM, a high-performance WebAssembly engine optimized for near-feeless transactions. As part of the Antelope framework, EOS also supports multi-chain use cases, making it a versatile choice for institutions looking to explore decentralized applications and cross-chain opportunities.

37253016,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/bitcoin-btc-cuts-loose-bull-market-goes-into-overdrive,1733403701,Bitcoin ($BTC) cuts loose. Bull market goes into overdrive,"The Bitcoin ($BTC) price made a new all-time high, and stopped just short of $104,000 on Wednesday, as the world’s premier cryptocurrency burst through the $100,000 resistance for the first time. Where to next for Bitcoin? Peter Schiff eats his words Peter Schiff, economist, gold bug and perennial Bitcoin hater, once said that Bitcoin will never get to $100,000. Today, he is being forced to eat those words, as the king of the cryptocurrencies powered through $100,000 on Wednesday. Schiff even blamed Bitcoin’s meteoric rise on the government, posting on X recently, that it only got to $100,000 “by buying off politicians, and getting in bed with government.” Schiff may want to take a look at the incredibly strong buying that is coming just from the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs. They bought another $555.8 million worth of Bitcoin on Wednesday. This is not government; it’s institutions and retail. Schiff’s main argument that Bitcoin is nothing; that it can’t be felt or touched, and therefore it has no intrinsic value; is becoming rather a ‘flat earth’ argument now. We are in the digital age, and therefore it should be expected that value can be extracted from digital constructions. Bitcoin breaks out and starts forming a pennant Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC shows how the price has burst out of the triangle , has rocketed higher, and how it is now forming a pennant or flag. This is extremely bullish for a continuation of this price pump. The Fibonacci levels for the high and low of the triangle suggest that the next level to be hit could be at $105,000 at the 1.618 Fibonacci. The 2.618 Fibonacci would potentially be next at $113,500. Of course, this is all dependent on the bulls keeping this current upside momentum going. If the bears are able to wrest back some kind of control, a return to $100,000 is certainly possible. Bitcoin 2-week chart a thing of beauty Source: TradingView When looking at investing in an asset, it is always best to step right out of the short-term chart and take an eagle’s eye view of the entire picture. Therefore, zooming out into the 2-week chart, one has a spectacular view of Bitcoin. The above chart really is a thing of beauty. All the price action of this current bull market is just following a classic pattern. It can be seen how the bull market took off to the upside early in 2023, and how it eventually got to the level of the previous bull market top in 2021. Previous highs are always going to be extremely difficult to break and hold above, and the $69,000 level was no different. This took 36 weeks of sideways price action within a bull flag before a candle could finally open and hold above this level. And what a candle this was. A nearly 40% candle, which equated to $26,400 in price. Since then, it has been onwards and upwards. With potentially up to around another year left in this cycle, how high the Bitcoin price will eventually go is one for the crystal balls. A note of caution in RSI A note of caution can be found in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at the bottom of the chart. A descending trendline shows that the bulls will need to force the indicator line above, and make a new high. Otherwise, strong bearish divergence comes into play. This is definitely something to keep an eye on. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Its surge ignited a bullish sentiment among crypto investors and market watchers, fueling optimism for higher targets. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Crashes 33% In South Korea Amid Increasing Political Turmoil Tron Hits New ATH After 7 Years As Bitcoin (BTC) continues moving sideways between the $94,000-$96,00 price range, many altcoins have started recording massive rallies. Cardano (ADA) recently reclaimed the $1 mark in a 200% rally, while XRP soared above the $2.5 resistance on a 300% surge. Yesterday, TRX, the native token of the Tron Blockchain, soared 104% intraday to hit its news ATH in nearly seven years. The token moved from its daily low of $0.22 to the $0.29 mark, surpassing its previous high of $0.23. The rally continued with another jump above the $0.30 barrier before climbing to its latest ATH of $0.45 on Tuesday night. The surge saw the cryptocurrency flip some crypto rivals, sending Tron back into the top ten crypto list. According to CoinMarketCap data, TRX’s market capitalization hit over $36 billion, surpassing Toncoin (TON) and Avalanche (AVAX) by this metric. Tron founder Justin Sun highlighted the feat in an X post: 6 years later. Still here. Still #BUIDLing. Things have changed, but one thing hasn’t: #TRON remains a top 10 contender. Since then, Tron has retraced around 20%, hovering above the $0.35-$0.36 zone before falling to the $0.33 mark. Despite the retrace, TRX remained the leading cryptocurrency, with 20% gains in the last 24 hours. TRX’s Rally To Continue? As TRX’s price surged, crypto analyst Javon Mar stated that Tron was “HEAVILY on what can be soon noted as a historical bullish move.” He also suggested that the cryptocurrency’s price was “far from done,” forecasting another massive rally to the $1.1 area. Similarly, another analyst noted that TRX has “finally triggered a MEGA setup from all the way back in 2018 on its dominance chart” against all other Altcoins. And added that Tron has “barely put its running shoes on.” Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Could See A Correction Despite Historic Monthly Close, $400 Still On Sight? The analyst also signaled that a test of the previous ATH was possible as a retest of that level as support could propel the token to $0.50. However, Team LAMBO advised to watch out for the $0.33 level. The analyst stated that Tron was possibly “cooking a massive bull flag on the 15-minute timeframe,” with the bottom trendline between the $0.35-$0.36 price range. A breakout above $0.42 could target the $0.60 barrier while breaking down the pattern and losing the $0.33 support would invalidate it. As of this writing, TRX is trading at $0.33, a nearly 80% surge in the past seven days and a 116% monthly jump.

In an official X post, it noted “Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible.” Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible. We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards. Stay tuned… — Ripple (@Ripple) December 4, 2024 RLUSD, a 1:1 U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, will be fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. government Treasury securities and cash equivalents. Since early August, the RLUSD stablecoin has been in beta testing on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the Ethereum mainnet. Ripple plans to gradually expand RLUSD to include new blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The RLUSD stablecoin is expected to play a significant role in the Ripple ecosystem. XRP Loses Its Position XRP had recently been on a rally amidst a broader altcoin rally. However, this announcement took XRP’s price down to $2.31 within 24 hours. This also took away XRP’s position of the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, as Tether bounced back. XRP is currently trading at $2.39, down over 6% in the last 24 hours. Its market cap stands at $135 billion, down by over 7% in the past day. Nevertheless, XRP continues to stay ahead of Solana ( SOL ) and Binance token ( BNB ) even as the latter reached its all-time high on Dec. 4. Increased Selling Pressure While the news of the postponement of RLUSD preceded the drop in price, speculations also suggest the panic selling. This is further highlighted in the increased selling pressure, where both price and trading volume has come down over $32 billion to $16 billion on Dec. 4, which suggests that the market is in a cooling-off period at the moment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Attention Traders: Do Not Miss the 30% Rise of This Dwindling Altcoin in December 2024 , Bullish Sentiment Prevails Notably, the XRP price has crashed by 25% from the year-to-date high, ending a strong rally that pushed it to its highest level since 2018. Surprisingly, the drop comes even as Bitcoin price crossed the historic level of $100k . However, if the price of XRP ends the day above $2.1793, it will likely lead to a rebound. Analysts believe that there is more upside momentum to XRP this bull run. Many analysts believe that the current bullish cycle is very similar to the ones in 2020 and 2017. “If this pattern holds true, the first major price correction (15% to 30%) won’t come until Bitcoin hits $135,000 or even $159,000,” noted a prominent on-chain analyst, Ali Martinez . The broader market is riding high waves amidst Bitcoin breaching a significant level. Bitcoin’s gains could soon be mirrored amongst the altcoins, propelling newer highs for coins like XRP. FAQs Why did Ripple postpone the RLUSD stablecoin launch? Ripple delayed RLUSD’s launch as it awaits final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). How did the RLUSD launch delay affect XRP’s price? XRP’s price dropped to $2.31 within 24 hours following the RLUSD launch delay, marking a 6% decline in value.

ADA's decentralization and technical advancements, such as the Chang Hard Fork and Halo 2, set it apart from Ethereum and Solana. On-chain metrics show increased unique addresses and developer activity, indicating genuine interest and growth in the Cardano network. ADA is a strong long-term hold, but new buyers should be cautious; expect resistance at $2.3 and the potential for a meaningful retracement. Thesis Summary Cardano (ADA-USD) has been on a monster rally over the last month, comparable to the likes of Ripple (XRP-USD). The once-forgotten cryptocurrency is making headlines, and for good reasons. Over the past few weeks, ADA has made notable improvements to its scalability and smart contracts. Crypto investors have been impressed, and this is reflected in the on-chain metrics and technical outlook. The way I see it, ADA could easily rally above $2 in the coming month, but what happens after that will depend on the broader crypto market. Reviewing The Basics; Introducing Voltaire Altseason is upon us, and we’ve seen plenty of action in the space. Cardano, which for a while had been lagging the market, has now staged a 200% rally. It’s been a while since we talked Cardano, so let’s quickly review the basics. ADA Roadmap (Cardano.org) Cardano is a Layer 1 blockchain that is comparable in many ways to competitors like Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD). ADA uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism based on the Ouroboros algorithm and a dual-layer system . But what I’ve always liked the most about ADA is its clear roadmap. From the beginning, the project laid out the different stages of development, which are divided into eras. As of right now, we are currently in the final stages, the Voltaire era. The Chang Hard fork was introduced back on September 1st, incidentally, very close to the bottom in ADA prices. Through the Chang Hard Fork, the governance of the chain has now shifted to the ADA holders, who now have voting rights. Furthermore, it also introduced some technical improvements to smart contracts. Achieving decentralization helps set ADA apart from Solana and Ethereum, which I’d label as quite centralized right now. Add to this the massive improvements in TPS, and you have a true contender to the throne for L1 networks. Hydra And TPS Cardano recently introduced Hydra, a layer 2 scaling solution that has now allowed the network to process 1 million TPS. Notably, the Cardano team launched the 90’s FPS game Doom on Hydra in August, with each frame of the game a transaction on the protocol. Source: thecryptobasic With this new development, ADA is arguably one of the fastest networks out there, and it opens the door to thousands of real-world applications that are now practical. On top of that, we’ve also seen Cardano recently introduce zero-knowledge contracts through Halo 2. Halo 2 was developed as an extension and improvement of the original Halo protocol, designed by Sean Bowe at Electric Coin Company. By building on modern cryptographic primitives, Halo 2 enhances the overall security of zero-knowledge proof. Source: Cryptoslate The hype behind Cardano is not just based on speculative buying. There’s been real updates happening and this is also reflected in the on-chain metrics. On-chain metrics First off, we’ve seen a huge explosion in unique addresses. Cardano Unique Addresses (thecryptobasic) Clear evidence of renewed interest in the network, though still far below its peak numbers in 2021-22. Plutus Scripts (Cardano developer portal) Plutus scripts, which are used to build Dapp have been moving up since the beginning of November, also great evidence that more developers are using ADA. Cardano TVL (DeFi Lama) Of course, TVL (blue) and Volume (green) have exploded in the last month, but this is also due to the much higher price of the underlying asset, ADA. Technical Analysis All of this makes ADA a convincing altcoin to hold long-term, but short-term we may encounter some resistance. ADA TA (Trendspider) Since ADA bottomed in July, we can identify an initial impulse, a deep retracement and now another impulse. We are approaching the 1.618 ext of the initial impulse measured from the bottom of the retracement, and this is a possible target for this rally. Note, we also have some important volume resistance at this level. I’d expect some consolidation here, but once this level is broken, then we could quickly rally to the 2.618 ext at $2.3. This is close to the previous highs and also an important area of prior trade which will provide resistance. For those that bought near the bottom, that’s near a ten-bagger. Final Thoughts ADA has made great efforts to make itself a real contender as an L1 network. It’s definitely a coin worth holding, but the current rally limits the upside for any new buyers. I’d expect this to keep rallying until $2.3 and if we could get a meaningful retracement after that we might have a good opportunity to buy. Still, investors must consider that altcoins are volatile and cyclical.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742274-cardano-big-things-happening-adausd?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37253031.jpeg
37252956,https://square.htx.com/?p=41802,1733403600,"A Night of Gains! All Tokens Tied to Justin Sun Surged, $HTX Could Be the Next Big Coin","Overnight, all tokens associated with Justin Sun surged in price. As of 00:34 (UTC) on December 4, both $TRX and $SUN saw price increases of over 50% in 24 hours. Additionally, $TRX and $HTX reached new all-time high prices of 0.4497 USDT and 0.000003596 USDT, respectively. The SunPump ecosystem stood out with exceptional performance, as $FOFAR skyrocketed by over 100%, while $MUNCAT and $SUNCAT both posted gains of approximately 80%. TRX = XPR? $TRX’s price surge was spurred by a statement from Justin, who likened $TRX to $XRP, referring to it as “TRX, the next XRP” on his personal X account. As people joked and speculated about this comparison, $TRX’s price skyrocketed, mirroring $XRP’s previous surge, and reached a new all-time high at 0.4497 USDT. In response, Justin posted on his personal X: “6 years later. Still here. Still #BUIDLing. Things have changed, but one thing hasn’t: #TRON remains a top 10 contender.” MMCrypto, a crypto influencer, posted that $TRX has broken its 7-year-old all-time high. It deserves respect. It’s one of the few cryptos that beat Bitcoin over multiple cycles. He said that he’s waiting for a good long entry. Presto Research analyst Min Jung stated that the political event in South Korea may have contributed to TRX’s rise, but they are unlikely to be the sole reason. He mentioned that this surge in $TRX could also be part of a broader “Dino rotation”, where legacy cryptocurrencies like $XRP have been rallying under current market conditions. According to 0×Moon’s analysis, $TRX, the native token of the TRON blockchain, has benefited significantly from TRON’s solid stablecoin reserves. This has allowed $TRX to rise steadily, even though the ecosystem once seemed less mature. Meanwhile, the ongoing memecoin season has further fueled the rise of $TRX. He came to the conclusion that, upon a closer examination, projects linked to Justin have shown the greatest stability and the smallest declines during bear markets. Could $HTX Be the Next Big Coin? While Justin has remained highly visible and continuously active, $HTX has stayed relatively low-key, attracting little attention from investors. However, in recent days, it reached its all-time high with little fanfare. Data reveals that, at 23:13 (UTC) on December 3, $HTX reached $0.000003596, hitting a new all-time high. Since its low of $0.0000008 in early August, the token has rallied by nearly 350%. So, why should $HTX be on your radar? Crypto influencer Evans.eth shares three key reasons: 1. From “Liquidity Pledges” to “Direct Burns”, $HTX’s Circulating Market Cap Under Perfect Control The supply of $HTX has been reduced, which can help increase its price. This move sets the stage for $HTX to experience sustained price growth in the future. 2. Merge Mining and Earning, One Asset for Multiple Rewards, and Streamlined Process The HTX ecosystem is making it easier for users to earn rewards in multiple PrimePool opportunities for $HTX by combining mining and earning features. This approach offers higher returns with simpler processes. Not only does it enhance users’ capital efficiency, but it also broadens the practical applications and appeal of $HTX. Users can now lock $HTX to earn multiple rewards effortlessly! 3. Justin Prepares for Major Moves, Loyal Followers Are Already Reaping the Benefits With the bull market just starting, the HTX ecosystem is poised to experience a major influx of funds, with $HTX positioned to be a standout performer in the upcoming surge. Justin once again demonstrates his prowess in shaping market trends, with each move capturing significant attention. Evans.eth also highlighted that, through optimizing user experience and lowering entry barriers, $HTX is emerging as the core driving force behind the HTX ecosystem. A notable influx of funds has already been observed, and holding $HTX has become the preferred choice among users. As the HTX ecosystem evolves, the use cases for $HTX keep expanding. From payments and mining to earning and other innovative use cases, $HTX’s value will continue to strengthen within this closed-loop ecosystem. He concluded by stating that $HTX has already outpaced other trending cryptos, establishing itself as a key signal for the onset of a new bull run. Looking ahead, $HTX is poised to become a central hub for capital, ushering in a new wave of upward momentum. Crypto Bull Market Set to Exceed Expectations and Just Getting Started With $HTX and $TRX both hitting new all-time highs, Crypto Squirtle, the founder of Australia’s largest Chinese crypto community, commented, “We have to admit that Justin still has some tricks up his sleeve.” Evans.eth also remarked that Justin has never been dishonest—it’s just that the bull market hasn’t fully arrived yet. When discussing the future outlook of the bull market, Justin shared in a recent media interview that 2025 is set to be a landmark year. The four-year cycle of the cryptocurrency industry is clear. At present, with Trump’s victory and favorable regulations, things are looking even more promising. He also candidly stated that he refrains from predicting prices, as they sometimes exceed expectations. As Justin said on social media, ‘this is just the beginning,’ and crypto enthusiasts may want to take advantage of this momentum. The post A Night of Gains!

37254783,https://invezz.com/?p=2370339,1733403584,"Philippines finishes wholesale CBDC trial, eyes 24/7 fund transfers","The Philippine Central Bank has completed testing the proof of concept for its wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), which is expected to facilitate 24/7 fund transfers. On December 5, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Philippines’s central bank, announced the conclusion of the trial phase of its CBDC initiative code-named Project Agila. Under the initiative, the central bank worked alongside participating financial institutions to assess the system’s performance, functionality, programmability, and security. The wholesale CBDC is designed to facilitate secure, round-the-clock fund transfers, including weekends and holidays, among financial institutions. It has been developed using distributed ledger technology hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Wholesale CBDCs are issued by central banks and serve financial institutions for high-value transactions such as interbank payments, securities settlements, and cross-border operations. Unlike retail CBDCs, which are aimed at the general public, wholesale CBDCs cater exclusively to institutional use cases. According to BSP Governor Eli M. Remolona, Jr., wholesale CBDCs could “enhance liquidity management, reduce settlement risks, and support financial stability” in a bit to modernise the nation’s economy. The central bank plans to use insights from Project Agila to develop a long-term CBDC roadmap aimed at modernizing the country’s financial infrastructure. Launched in March 2022, Project Agila aims to assess how CBDC technology can improve the efficiency and resilience of the Philippines’ large-value payment systems. While the BSP has not committed to issuing a CBDC, the project underscores its strategy to adopt emerging technologies for financial modernization. The central bank has set a tentative timeline to introduce a wholesale CBDC by 2029, aligning with Governor Remolona’s tenure, as communicated in a July press briefing. BSP Deputy Governor Mamerto Tangonan noted at the time that the decision to launch a wholesale CBDC would depend heavily on the readiness of both the central bank and financial institutions. He explained that such a launch would only occur once the BSP is confident in its ability to “offer, maintain, and operate it safely” and when banks have developed viable business use cases for the digital currency. Tangonan emphasised the importance of ensuring operational security and understanding the practical implications of implementing a BSP-issued digital currency, noting this is “entirely new” and requires both the central bank and institutions to achieve a high level of literacy and preparedness. CBDCs are gaining momentum CBDCs have become a focal point for central banks globally as they explore digital currency solutions to modernize financial systems. India, similar to the Philippines, has adopted a cautious approach with its digital rupee pilot launched in 2022 as a bank-to-bank solution. The Reserve Bank of India is currently evaluating the security implications and potential impact on monetary policy transmission. RBI Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar has stated that the rollout to retail users will only proceed after thorough assessments, with no fixed timeline established. Brazil is also advancing its CBDC initiative, Drex, after entering the second phase of its pilot program. Major companies, including Microsoft, Chainlink, Banco Inter, and 7Comm, are collaborating on the project to refine its operational framework.

While there are different price predictions for BTC at this point, on-chain data platform IntoTheBlock stated that Bitcoin's cycle top is expected to be between $130,000 and $190,000. IntoTheBlock, in a post from the X account, stated that Bitcoin has exceeded $100,000 and said that the rise could potentially continue due to Bitcoin's limited supply and significant interest from large investors. However, IntoTheBlock analysts noted that historically, returns have steadily declined after each halving cycle and announced their predictions. Analysts say some believe Bitcoin could reach $1 million, but IntoTheBlock says that following the recent halving, returns will likely range between 100% and 200%, with a more reasonable estimated price range being between $130,000 and $190,000. IntoTheBlock analysts added that if Bitcoin becomes part of global reserve assets, the price range could rise even higher. “Bitcoin has crossed $100,000! A major milestone, so what's next? It is important to note that each cycle clearly has diminishing returns, as 2013 showed a 7900% return rate; 2017 – 2560%; 2021 – 594%. While some expect a million dollars per Bitcoin, a more reasonable expectation would be a 100%-200% return on the halving price, placing the top between 130k and 190k.” https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1864546855050186894 *This is not investment advice.

The sector has recorded two bull phases: the first peaking in March and the second still ongoing. XRP and Dogecoin have been among the stellar performers this year, but crypto whales are also adding newcomer altcoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO) to their portfolios for maximum gain by the end of the year. XRP Price Pursues $3 As Dogecoin Edges Toward $1 XRP has had a landmark year. In August, the SEC legal battle for Ripple finally came to a close after nearly four years, and the $125 million was regarded by many in crypto and beyond as a victory for the payments company. Since then, its price has surged 340% and is now trading above $2.6 for the first time in nearly seven years. The next target for XRP is $3, which would take its total market cap to $171.5 billion, making it more valuable than Europe’s second-largest bank HSBC and the world’s third-largest telecoms company AT&T. This would also cement its position as the third largest crypto after Bitcoin and Ethereum after it recently flipped USDT. XRP will likely keep surging as investors anticipate a pro-crypto Congress and regulatory agencies as the Trump administration takes over. Ripple is reported to be already close to getting a license for its RLUSD stablecoin in New York, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse could be the next crypto tsar under Trump; all these factors will lead to an XRP rally. Dogecoin is yet another token that will massively benefit from this pro-crypto approach by the US government. DOGE has an edge over most cryptos since its foremost advocator Elon Musk is part of the new government as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Many expect that Musk will push for DOGE adoption in his companies more spiritedly than ever, and this optimism is likely to spread to other major listed and private companies. For Dogecoin to hit $1, it will have to break out of a descending wedge pattern that it has been caught in since mid-November. An attempt to break out earlier this week was rebuffed, but one analyst says this is exactly the pattern he expected, and that the surge is coming soon. Crypto Whales Accumulate Yeti Ouro Investors are also rushing to invest in Yeti Ouro during its ongoing presale before the price of its native YETIO tokens skyrockets. The tokens are currently going for a mere $0.012, and with analysts expecting a surge towards the $1 mark, it presents a lucrative opportunity in the bull market. In its presale, Yeti Ouro has sold 77 million tokens to thousands of investors, raising $923,000. Yeti Ouro’s play-to-earn game Yeti Go promises a thrill for players. The game has been built using the Unreal Engine, and the project has on boarded some of the world’s best game developers, who have worked on iconic titles such as The Witcher 3, Spiderman and Call of Duty. The action-packed game tasks users with winning a race against other opponents, while dodging hazards, obstacles and attacks from fellow players. The ecosystem is powered by YETIO, which users pay to join a race with, earn the reward in and stake to unlock exclusive rewards. They can also pay for upgraded weapons, unique skins and other customizations on the in-game marketplace.

37252846,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623117,1733403154,How much has the CFTC made from crypto enforcement in 2024?,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reportedly secured $17.1 billion for fiscal year 2024 through financial enforcement. The figure, which includes $2.6 billion in civil monetary penalties and $14.5 billion in disgorgement and restitution, is said to be the agency’s “largest recovery ever.” In a press statement released on November 4, the financial law enforcement authority CFTC announced it had collected over $17 billion by initiating 58 new enforcement actions, including groundbreaking cases in digital asset commodities. The agency’s inaugural efforts to combat fraud sought cases from voluntary carbon credit markets, intricate manipulation cases across multiple markets, and noteworthy compliance cases, including the largest compliance-related case in its history. CFTC enforcements in 2024. Source: X The CFTC also pursued ongoing litigation with determination, achieving notable victories that yielded substantial recoveries. The largest recoveries were tied to high-profile enforcement actions against cryptocurrency exchanges FTX and Binance. Landmark crypto cases included FTX and Binance The CFTC’s enforcement efforts in 2024 were headlined by its actions against cryptocurrency giants FTX and Binance. These cases alone accounted for a significant portion of the agency’s record-breaking recoveries. FTX’s case involved fraud allegations targeting the exchange, its affiliate Alameda Research, and several of its executives, including founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The settlement resulted in $8.7 billion in restitution and $4 billion in disgorgement, an amount the CFTC called the largest recovery in the agency’s history. Bankman-Fried, who faced both criminal and civil proceedings, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March. Litigations against other FTX affiliates, including co-founder Gary Wang, former Alameda co-CEO Caroline Ellison, and FTX co-owner Nishad Singh, are still ongoing. The CFTC also reached a settlement with Binance, its founder Changpeng Zhao, and other executives for operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and evading U.S. regulations. The penalties the agency issued included $150 million from Zhao, $1.5 million from former Chief Compliance Officer Samuel Lim, and a combined $1.35 billion in civil monetary penalties and disgorgement from Binance. Other crypto firms under scrutiny In addition to the high-profile cases against FTX and Binance, the CFTC continued to actively pursue enforcement actions throughout the digital asset sector. Among the notable actions was the charge against former Voyager Digital CEO Stephen Ehrlich for commodity pool fraud and registration violations. A significant legal victory followed when a federal court rejected Ehrlich’s motion to dismiss, allowing the case to proceed. The agency also secured a major win in its case against Seneca Ventures LLC, a fraudulent Ponzi-like operation involving crypto investments and misappropriated carbon offset funds. The court ordered the defendants to pay over $230 million in combined civil monetary penalties, restitution, and disgorgement. The financial authority also tackled a case involving romance scam fraud, charging staff members of crypto exchange Debiex with defrauding victims of $2.3 million through a pig-butchering scam. Enforcement action on firms outside crypto While digital assets played a central role in the CFTC’s 2024 enforcement activity, it also extended its net to monitor other financial industries. In September, the agency announced that Judge Mary Rowland of the Northern District of Illinois issued a final judgment against Sam Ikkurty and several entities, including Seneca Ventures LLC, ordering them to pay $209 million in compensation. The ruling followed fraud and misappropriation allegations, with the court siding with the financial authority on all charges. The CFTC also recovered over $18 million in stolen digital assets from a court-appointed receiver. CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam highlighted the agency’s adaptability in overseeing markets disrupted by technology. He emphasized the agency’s role in safeguarding consumers and ensuring the integrity of U.S. markets. “Misconduct in our jurisdictional markets is rarely confined, especially as these boundaries are continually being redefined by disruptive technology,” said Behnam.

37252631,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373542,1733403034,Ripple Price Analysis: What’s Next for XRP Following the Recent 17% Crash?,"The recent XRP rally has been nothing short of remarkable. The asset broke through major resistance levels and gained significant momentum. However, with current indicators reflecting signs of overextension, a short-term correction or consolidation phase appears to be on the horizon. XRP Price Analysis By Shayan The Weekly Chart XRP has staged an impressive breakout, rallying nearly 300% in recent weeks. The price has exceeded the $2 resistance and moved toward the $3 psychological level. This bullish momentum has been fueled by substantial buying pressure, as indicated by the decisive move above the 100—and 200-week moving averages. Notably, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) has soared into overbought territory, reaching a level of 91, which is extremely rare and indicative of overheated conditions. Historically, such extreme RSI levels often precede periods of consolidation or corrective retracements. From a structural perspective, the $1.80-$2 range now serves as critical support, and a pullback to these levels would represent a healthy correction for the continuation of the broader uptrend. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, XRP maintained a strong bullish structure, consistently setting higher highs and lows within an ascending channel. The recent breakout above $2.5 highlights buyers’ dominance, though the price briefly retreated after encountering resistance near $3. Interestingly, the RSI in this timeframe has shown a significant bearish divergence, suggesting waning momentum. This, coupled with the increasingly crowded long positions in the futures market, raises the likelihood of short-term corrective action. A pullback toward the $2.40-$2.50 region, aligning with the lower boundary of the ascending channel, could provide a fresh entry point for bulls. In summary, while Ripple’s mid-term outlook remains overwhelmingly bullish, the market will likely experience short-term consolidation or a minor correction. This would be a welcome development, allowing for healthier and more sustainable growth in the weeks ahead.

Besides, the second largest token, Ethereum, also demonstrated acute strength and was about to reach the pivotal range at $4000. This move is expected to be the most bullish signal, which is expected to elevate the price levels beyond the current ATH at $4,800. Will the ETH price surpass and sustain above $4000 in this attempt? The Ethereum price has been closely following the star token; it maintained a sluggish trend while the BTC price traded horizontally below $97,000. The token gained immense strength as it rose above the consolidation around $3700. As it happened earlier in Q1, the bears appear to strongly hold the zone around $4000, due to which the price is finding it a tedious job to surpass. Besides, the price is expected to initiate a fine rise once the token sustains above $4000, activating the higher targets beyond not only $5000 or $6000. The weekly chart of the Ethereum price suggests the token is attempting to breach the upper resistance of the decisive symmetric triangle. The supertrend has turned bullish, suggesting a significant flip in the trend, validating the bullish claim. Moreover, the price has reached the neckline of the cup & holder pattern and a breakout from the range is expected to push the prices towards the ATH. The RSI, which is undergoing a parabolic recovery, hints towards the growing strength of the bulls. Therefore, the Ethereum price is expected to rise above $4000 after Bitcoin marks the milestone of $100,000. The bulls are facing some hindrances but the price is expected to break out of the range anytime from now. However, after rising over $4000, the price may head towards the ATH. However, the real targets remain above $6000 at 1.2FIB, which is around 60% away from the current levels.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-forms-a-bullish-pattern-if-eth-price-smahes-these-levels-a-60-rise-is-imminent-reaching-6000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In a new analysis , the BitMEX co-founder highlights the low per-transaction cost of the layer-1 blockchain Aptos ( APT ). “In 2017, it was not uncommon for a hot ICO to render the Ethereum network inoperable. Gas fees would spike, and no one could use the network affordably. In 2025, the cost of block space on Ethereum, Solana, Aptos and other layer-1’s will be extremely cheap. The current order throughput is orders of magnitude higher than in 2017. If a team can garner a broad base of support from avid degen speculators, their ability to raise funds will not be hampered by a slow and expensive blockchain. Given the insanely low per-transaction cost of using Aptos, there is an opportunity for them to become the preferred chain [for] ICO launches. Average transaction fee in $: Aptos: $0.0016 Solana: $0.05 Ethereum: $5.22″ In June, Hayes predicted Aptos would overtake Solana at some point in this market cycle. Aptos’ native token, APT, is trading at $13.25 at time of writing. The 30th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 8% in the past 24 hours.

37258945,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104060,1733402478,Pundit Says Those Who Can’t Read Charts Call for $589 XRP,"A heated debate has erupted within the XRP community as Tony Edward, the founder of the Thinking Crypto Podcast, challenges wild price predictions for XRP. He dismissed figures like $589 as unrealistic and grounded in fantasy. Edward has set a conservative price target for XRP , predicting a range between $5 and $8 for this market cycle. While acknowledging the potential for slight upward movement, Edward firmly rejected more extreme predictions, including the oft-repeated $589, $1,000, and even $10,000 targets. Accordingly, he emphasized the importance of analyzing market trends, on-chain data, and fundamentals when setting expectations.The Community PushbackThe tweet sparked a critical response from Xena, a passionate XRP proponent. Specifically, Xena took issue with Edward’s outlook, calling out what she perceived as hypocrisy in his position.She pointed to Edward’s extensive XRP content as a driving force behind his platform’s success. In parallel, she questioned why he dedicated so much attention to the asset if he only envisions a modest upside. “If $5–$8 is your realistic target, why focus so much on XRP, knowing the community holds higher hopes,” Xena questioned .Xena reminded Edward that many coins, starting from just a few cents, have surged into the double—or triple-digit range, leaving the possibility that XRP could follow suit.She also highlighted XRP’s unique use cases, suggesting that its value cannot be fully captured by technical charts alone. For Xena, the community’s faith in XRP is based on its utility in transforming cross-border payments, which could justify higher valuations in the future.Ultimately, Xena suggested that Edward might be downplaying XRP’s potential to manage his brand and profit from views. “I'm Not Here for Fairytales”Edward responded with a mix of humor and conviction, dismissing Xena’s criticism as an overreaction. He explained that, despite his long-standing admiration for XRP and its technology, he refuses to indulge in ""fairy tales"" or speculative price forecasts. https://twitter.com/ThinkingCrypto1/status/1864419168419774511Referring to his years of experience in the crypto market, he reiterated his belief that realistic price targets must be based on data rather than hope or hype. “I'm not here for fairytales, bud. I've seen this space filled with conspiracy theories and unrealistic hopes. I respect charts and on-chain data,” Edward said .Xena, undeterred, expressed disappointment with what she sees as Tony’s shift away from the optimism that initially attracted many to XRP. She contended that XRP's future value might not be driven solely by market charts but by deeper, often overlooked factors—ones that could push the token to much higher levels than Edward is willing to accept.Meanwhile, prominent XRPL dUNL validator Vet noted that the $589 calls are not necessarily discussions around price targets for XRP.

On December 4, Hailey Welch, a social media influencer, introduced her own memecoin, Hawk Tuah. In a mere 20 minutes following its introduction, the crypto coin fell from $500 million to $60 million. Hailey Welch, who is popularly referred to as the Hawk Tuah Girl on the internet, introduced $HAWK on Solana. Within minutes of its introduction, the coin experienced a rapid spike, reaching a market cap of approximately $500 million. Soon after, it crashed to nearly $60 million. Solana (SOL) provided additional confirmation of the information on X. However, Welch has denied any insider sales or activity on behalf of her team or any associated entities. However, Welch has denied any insider sales or activity on behalf of her team or any associated entities. BubbleMaps graphic of Hailey Welch’s $HAWK memecoin. Source: X Hawk Tuah memecoin declines into failure Hailey Welch disclosed the launch of the $HAWK memecoin in a post on X and during an episode of her Talk Tuah podcast, which featured billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban. She stated that she is aware that a significant number of her followers are unfamiliar with crypto, so she is committed to simplifying the onboarding process. Welch established partnerships with the OverHere platform and Web3 Launchpad to support the launch of $HAWK. She later partnered with Shiba Inu to distribute 20 million HAWK tokens to its community. Shiba wrote, “Hyped to announce our friendshib with Hailey Welch and Overhere! We have secured 20M HAWK tokens for the SHIB community (and Yes Leash!) and our frends at DeLoreanLabs!” The Hawk token’s supply was reportedly “sniped” shortly after its introduction. This means that early investors acquired substantial quantities of the token, thereby limiting token availability for the rest of the community. Typically, it is an indicator of a project’s viability, as it helps potential investors know that the token is owned by a limited number of individuals. As per aggregated data from Bubblemaps and Dexscreener, a combination of insider wallets and snipers controlled between 80% and 90% of HAWK’s supply at launch. According to DexScreener data , the token’s price experienced a 91% decline in less than three hours and was trading, with a total valuation of $43.1 million at the time of publication. $HAWK market cap data. Source: DexScreener However, it has been verified that not all HAWK holders have sold their units. The current market cap is $732,165, with a price of $0.0008037. Despite the ongoing debate, Hawk token continues to be closely monitored by the community, which is requesting further disclosures to verify these claims and maintain a vigilant watch on the project. The aftermath of Hawk Tuah’s fall Welch’s official account explained in a post published on X that the team had not sold any tokens and that no key opinion leaders had received free coins. It was also mentioned that the token had been introduced on the Meteora decentralized liquidity protocol to mitigate the risk of sniping. However, a wallet was able to acquire 17.5% of the memecoin’s supply for 4,195 Wrapped Solana (WSOL) — a sum equivalent to $993,000 at the time — mere seconds after its debut, as indicated by data from the Solana block explorer Solscanner. The wallet generated a profit of $1.3 million by selling 135.8 million HAWK tokens within the next one-and-a-half hours. On the other hand, one investor exchanged approximately $1.4 million of MOODENG, another memecoin, for the HAWK token. They incurred a loss of slightly more than $1.3 million, as indicated by on-chain data. Law firms have begun advertising their services to individuals who lost money on the memecoin, and numerous users on X have declared that they have submitted complaints to the SEC regarding the token. High memecoin failure in the crypto industry Reports have revealed a staggering 97% failure rate for memecoin projects since 2024. The data suggests that memecoins have an average lifespan of only one year, in contrast to the typical three-year lifespan of other crypto entities. According to AlphaQuest, a crypto research platform, 2,020 memecoin initiatives fail on average each month. The report, which examined 30,000 projects, emphasizes the considerable risk associated with meme currencies, describing them as a rollercoaster of fortunes or a financial minefield. The report showed that Base has the highest mortality rate at 66.91%, followed by Solana at 54.03% and Ethereum at 36.59%. Furthermore, malicious activities are associated with more than half (55.24%) of memecoins. Still, memecoins continue to appeal to investors who want to achieve rapid returns despite the risks associated with them. Approximately 60% of investors in this asset class regard them as short-term investments. The research also demonstrates that memecoins have become a substantial component of numerous crypto portfolios, with two-thirds of crypto investors having invested in them at some point. Investors’ perceptions of memecoins are significantly influenced by their personal experiences.

Solana (SOL) is expected to rocket to $400 after breaking out of a bullish pennant. On the other hand, analysts say Cardano (ADA) may reach $5. Meanwhile, the most interesting part is the potential growth of the DeFi coin, Intel Markets (INTL) . Analysts say the presale token could soar 10x in the coming months based on its unique AI features. Solana breaks out of bullish pennant The Solana coin has broken out of a bullish pennant that has been in place for over 8 months. This move is often regarded as a sign of a potential uptrend. Two analysts who noticed the breakout believe a new all-time high is on the way. Titan of Crypto noted that Solana had printed its highest monthly candle close ever. They forecast the value of the Solana crypto could surge to $400 in the coming months. Another expert called Jelle predicted a price range of $400-$600. At the moment, the Solana price has suffered a minor correction, dropping to the $220 level. CoinMarketCap price information shows the altcoin has losses of 4.8% and 6.9% on the 7-day and 14-day timeframe, respectively. Despite the decline, SOL’s RSI remains above the midline, which is a bullish sign. Trend Rider says Cardano is set for a new ATH The Cardano coin started an uptrend in the first week of December. The cryptocurrency has risen from a low of $1.06 to a peak of $1.31. Price information from CoinMarketCap shows the Cardano price is now up 31.8% on the 7-day chart and 275.6% on the 30-day timeframe. With the recent rally, the Cardano crypto could rise to $2 in the coming days. RAFAELA RIGO is one crypto enthusiast who believes this scenario could play out in the next few weeks. Another analyst, Trend Rider, forecasted the value of Cardano might rally very fast to a new all-time high if it closes above $1.20. The coin’s current peak stands at $3.10. In the meantime, the Cardano token is showing bullish signals, according to Tradingview. Firstly, its 14-day RSI is in the overbought region. Also, the Hull Moving Average (9) and VWMA (10) are flashing buy signs which signals high buying activity.

37252732,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316661,1733401973,U.S. and U.K. Crack Down on Crypto Network Helping Russian Elites Evade Sanctions,"U.S. and U.K. authorities have taken action against a money-laundering network accused of helping Russian elites bypass international sanctions using cryptocurrency, particularly the stablecoin tether. Central to the network is Ekaterina Zhdanova, a prominent Russian businesswoman known for her involvement in Tether’s rise within the financial underworld, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal . Per the report, Zhdanova led an organization called Smart Group, which allegedly facilitated the conversion of bulk cash deliveries into cryptocurrency for high-profile clients. Russian Members of the Network Transferred Tether to Zhdanova The WSJ report, citing the U.S. Treasury Department, claimed Russian members of the network transferred tether to digital wallets controlled by Zhdanova. She is also accused of helping one client obscure the origins of funds used to purchase property in the U.K. Zhdanova and five other individuals have now been sanctioned, adding to her blacklisting last year. “Russian elites sought to exploit digital assets—in particular U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins—to evade U.S. and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the Kremlin,” said Bradley Smith, acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the U.S. Treasury. Tether, one of the most widely transacted cryptocurrencies, operates as a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Unlike government-regulated currencies, its transactions often occur outside of traditional financial oversight. Russia loves crypto because it’s an easy way to avoid financial U.S. sanctions. — Sake (@apebayc) December 4, 2024 While Tether Holdings, the British Virgin Islands-based issuer, was not directly implicated in this investigation, U.S. authorities are separately probing the company for potential violations of financial crime laws. Messages retrieved from Zhdanova’s Telegram account reveal she arranged substantial ruble-to-Tether transactions, with digital wallets linked to her handling over $350 million. Her extensive connections in Russia reportedly included links to oligarchs and high-ranking officials. Zhdanova, who once managed luxury travel services and boutique hotels in Moscow, was detained in France in late 2023 as part of a separate money-laundering investigation. U.K. Accuses Smart Group of Funding Russian Spies The U.K.’s National Crime Agency (NCA), which collaborated with the U.S. Treasury, has accused Smart Group of funding Russian espionage and laundering money for various criminal enterprises, including the notorious Irish Kinahan cartel. A London-based network, allegedly directed by Zhdanova, has allegedly laundered approximately $19 million through cash handovers across Britain. The NCA noted that cash deliveries were often followed by near-immediate cryptocurrency transactions of equivalent value. These funds were used by criminal gangs to purchase drugs and firearms without moving physical money across borders. Authorities have made 84 arrests in connection with the network, the report said. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a federal law introducing a new tax rule on crypto mining while granting legal recognition to digital currencies as property. The legislation, detailed in an official document released on November 29, outlined tax regulations and requirements for the cryptocurrency sector. Russia’s push to regulate cryptocurrency mining took a significant step forward when it legalized crypto mining in August 2024. The legislation, which took effect on November 1, only allows registered Russian entities and entrepreneurs to mine cryptocurrency.

Announcing his departure on December 4 via X, Federa called the decision to leave Solana after four transformative years one of his most challenging yet necessary career moves. DoubleZero aims to tackle the connectivity challenges faced by high-performance blockchains, offering a neutral infrastructure optimized for scalability, decentralization, and reduced latency. According to Federa, this innovative architecture isn’t a traditional Layer 1 or Layer 2 solution but an entirely new category called an “N1,” capable of supporting tens of millions of transactions per second. “We’re starting with Solana,” Federa stated, “but DoubleZero is a foundation for all high-performance blockchains.” Revolutionizing Blockchain Communication DoubleZero’s architecture introduces key advancements to eliminate bottlenecks in blockchain communication. The network utilizes a permissionless system of dedicated fiber and subsea cables, supported by independent contributors. The recently published white paper outlines two primary enhancements: Efficient Outbound Messaging: Messages can be routed, tracked, and prioritized, improving blockchain efficiency. Spam and Duplicate Filtering: Specialized hardware filters inbound transactions, reducing the load on individual validators. By integrating these features, DoubleZero promises to free blockchains from communication constraints, paving the way for maximum throughput and reduced latency. Signature verification for inbound data is handled by open-source network devices, further ensuring decentralization and scalability. “The goal,” Federa further explains, “is to solve a problem at the heart of the internet and high-performance blockchain: global, base-layer connectivity.” A Broader Horizon While DoubleZero is set to revolutionize blockchain performance, its potential extends to other industries. The white paper suggests applications in online gaming, where latency is critical, and in training large language models that require high-bandwidth connections between data centers. Co-founded by Federa alongside crypto entrepreneurs Andrew McConnell and Mateo Ward, DoubleZero launches with contributions from Firedancer and Malbec Labs, promising a collaborative approach to its ambitious goals. As DoubleZero positions itself as a cornerstone of high-performance networks, its impact could redefine what’s possible for decentralized systems, not only in blockchain but across the digital landscape.

Avalanche has surged 11% amid speculation of high-level governmental collaborations, reaching $70, while Cardano boasts a staggering 300% annual gain. But it’s Qubetics ($TICS) leading the pack with $4.3 million raised in its presale. Together, these projects are reshaping the crypto landscape and are set to dominate December 2024. While Avalanche and Cardano build their momentum with strong fundamentals and timely market moves, Qubetics is stepping in to address critical blockchain challenges, including interoperability and accessibility. With incredible ROI potential, it could be the best crypto to join in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain with Asset Tokenisation When you think about blockchain development, what comes to mind? Complex coding? Frustrating integration hurdles? Qubetics is introducing groundbreaking asset tokenisation, enabling individuals and businesses to convert tangible and intangible assets into blockchain-based tokens. Imagine transforming real estate properties, art collections, or intellectual property into tradable digital assets— Qubetics makes this a reality. This innovation unlocks liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets, empowering both institutional and retail investors. Picture a start-up tokenising its intellectual property to secure funding or a property owner selling fractional ownership of high-value real estate to global investors.

Avalanche’s blockchain ensures decentralised applications function without a hitch, making it a strong contender for long-term gains.

ADA, now trading at $1.32 after a 300% annual increase, could surpass $1.50 as analysts watch for its post-unlock recovery and sustained bullish sentiment.

Currently in its 11th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 266 million tokens to more than 6,200 holders, raising $4.3 million. At $0.0282 per token, it’s the best ongoing presale to buy now if you’re looking for serious gains. And guess what? That price is about to jump 10% this weekend. Learn more about the presale .

Toncoin: The Rising Star of TON Blockchain Toncoin has been quietly making waves on The Open Network (TON), and December 2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal month. Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Toncoin has become a favourite among developers and traders alike. The recent announcement of Binance delisting certain BTC margin pairs has unexpectedly shone a spotlight on Toncoin, as traders look for stable alternatives. What sets Toncoin apart is its seamless integration with messaging giant Telegram. Imagine being able to send and receive crypto as easily as texting your best friend. That’s the kind of user experience Toncoin delivers. And it’s not just about convenience; Toncoin’s advanced smart contract capabilities make it a robust platform for dApps and NFTs.

Its resilience in the face of market volatility—even amidst Binance’s margin trading shakeup—is a testament to its strong fundamentals. If you’re considering the best crypto to join in December 2024, Toncoin deserves a spot on your radar. Binance Coin (BNB): A Veteran Poised for a Comeback Binance Coin has been a staple in the crypto market for years, and it’s not going anywhere. While the delisting of BTC margin pairs has stirred the pot, BNB’s utility as a transaction token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) keeps it in high demand. Whether you’re staking, trading, or just paying fees, BNB remains an indispensable asset. What’s intriguing about BNB is its deflationary model. With periodic token burns, Binance ensures a shrinking supply, which could drive up demand—and price—over time. Pair that with its integration into the Binance ecosystem, and you’ve got a coin with staying power. Despite some regulatory hurdles earlier in the year, BNB has weathered the storm. The current market environment, coupled with Binance’s proactive efforts to streamline services, makes BNB a strong contender for growth in 2024. If you’re in the market for the best crypto to join in December 2024, BNB’s track record and future potential make it a solid pick.

37252035,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389625,1733401825,SUI Price Just Hit New ATH $4: What Next For Sui Now?,"The post SUI Price Just Hit New ATH $4: What Next For Sui Now? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Sui, the native token of the layer-1 blockchain platform, has hit an exciting new all-time high (ATH) of $4, marking a remarkable 100% surge in just 30 days. This rapid growth is fueled by significant developments within the platform’s DeFi ecosystem , which has seen its total value locked (TVL) rise to a whopping $1.61 billion. SUI Hit New ATH $4 The Sui blockchain has been gaining momentum in the crypto world, positioning itself as a developer-friendly platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Following Bitcoin’s rise to a new ATH of $103K, Sui has also soared, hitting a fresh milestone of $4.04 just recently. Over the past few months, Sui has rewarded its supporters with an incredible 760% return on investment, making it one of the top-performing altcoins this year. Sui’s growth isn’t just reflected in its price. The platform’s TVL has surged dramatically, growing from $665 million to $1.61 billion in just nine days . This surge in TVL highlights the growing confidence in the Sui ecosystem, with users increasingly locking their assets into smart contracts for staking, lending, and liquidity provision. What’s Next for Sui? Sui’s technical analysis is showing mixed signals, but the long-term outlook is incredibly bullish. The Bollinger Bands Trend suggests some short-term caution as the market momentum turns negative. However, these negative readings could mean the token is oversold, often leading to price bounces once the selling pressure dies down. Meanwhile, Coinglass data indicates a surge in inflows to exchanges , a common sign that people are preparing to sell. Perhaps Sui’s price is still showing strong bullish momentum. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines are in a favorable pattern, signaling that the price could soon soar higher. With immediate targets of $4.54 and a psychological resistance at $5.00, Sui is primed to hit new all-time highs. Some experts believe the token could reach $7 soon, and others predict a jaw-dropping $17 by year’s end. FAQs What is the sui price? At the time of writing, the price of this altcoin was $4.06 What is the future of Sui cryptocurrency? With the rising popularity of the Sui token, this project may achieve the $23.77 mark by 2030. Is Sui cryptocurrency a good investment?

As such, many analysts have cautioned that the asset might have already topped out during this cycle and warned traders to be wary about longing it. XRP’s Rally and Stagnation The so-called ‘Trump Pump’ pushed the entire crypto market north. Even though XRP was slightly sluggish at first, it eventually joined the pack and outperformed it on several occasions. On a monthly scale, Ripple’s native token exploded by over 420% at one point, surging to nearly $3. This multi-year high came earlier this week, helping XRP surpass SOL, BNB, and USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, this is where things started to go sour. Much of XRP’s volume and demand had come from a massive demand from South Korea before the country’s political leaders suddenly announced a brief implementation of martial law. Although the entire crypto market slumped after the news broke, XRP was harmed the most and failed to recover in the following days, unlike BTC and many other alts. The cross-border token lost its third spot in the charts to Tether and has underperformed in the past 24 hours, even though Trump named a pro-crypto SEC Chair to replace Ripple’s nemesis, Gary Gensler. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s chief executive, was quick to praise Paul Atkins as the right choice for SEC leadership, as he will “bring common sense back to the agency.” An outstanding choice – Paul Atkins at the helm of the SEC will bring common sense back to the agency. Along with Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, it’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto, restoring freedom of choice, economic growth, and innovation. https://t.co/w8Rqrnubyj — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 4, 2024 Topped Out? With XRP’s price correcting by nearly 20% since its local peak this week, many analysts have warned that the asset might have already topped out during this cycle. Crypto’s Batman indicated that the token was rejected at its 5-year bearish trendline and cautioned leveraged traders to be wary before opening long positions. $XRP might be topping out, facing rejection at its 5-year bearish trendline.

MEXC is known for its early listing of meme coins that then go on to explode in value. Pepe, Bonk, Dogwifhat and Shiba Inu all found early success on MEXC. The trading platform has become synonymous with spotting the meme coin trends first. Bonk chalked up a gain of 95,700%, Pepe 43,015%, NeiroCTO 37,492%, WIF 6,871% and GOAT 2,471%, to name but a few. It’s now time to add $SLAP to that price-explosive list. MEXC is also a Binance-beater when it comes to all-important market liquidity. Market depth determines the percentage amount a certain-sized trade can move the market. For example, its futures market depth is $100 million at the 0.05% and 0.1% levels, which outperforms major exchanges like Binance, and OKX. MEXC is the 10th largest exchange by trading volume – that means more eyes and money on Catslap ($SLAP) What’s more, MEXC’s substantial reach will bring Catslap to the attention of millions more potential buyers. According to CoinMarketCap, MEXC is the 10th largest cryptocurrency exchange for spot markets, with daily trading volumes of more than $10 billion and 5.2 million weekly visitors. MEXC lists 2,760 coins and is available in 170 jurisdictions around the world. Its centralized exchange listing makes it easier for crypto beginners to trade. MEXC accepts fiat payments in USD, EUR, and GBP as well as direct deposits in USD. Bagging the 10th biggest exchange is no mean feat, and further listings are sure to follow as the project grows in strength. The second CEX listing announcement will take place in two weeks’ time, as indicated by a new countdown clock on the Catslap homepage. Catslap has a fully diluted market capitalization of $63 million ($32 million based on circulating supply), so it is not far off the magic $100 million valuation. The addition of MEXC’s SLAP/USDT trading pair to the volume already generated for the SLAP/ETH pair will turbocharge the number of token holders. On the decentralized exchanges alone, token holders have rocketed to 13,179. Although the total number of token holders will be harder to ascertain because CEXs don’t allow that data to be collated, the trading volume will tell its own story. How buybacks and burns are driving Catslap’s value Bulls are being attracted to Catslap not only by its viral narrative and the hilarity of its slap raison d’etre but also by the ongoing development that has so far seen the rollout of staking, burning, buybacks, and Play-to-Earn mechanics in the form of Slap-to-Earn, as mentioned earlier. This utility package is making Catslap token stand out from the crowd by incentivizing interaction and heightened engagement in a way that older meme coins like Popcat haven’t. Alongside the individual Slap-to-Earn rewards (details to be announced soon), all token holders benefit from the burn events triggered by Slapometer milestones. To date there have been three major burns; at the 10 million, 25 million and 100 million slap milestones. The next big milestone is yet to be announced. By burning tokens it increases the scarcity and potential value of the remaining tokens. Burning also takes place when stakers unlock their tokens early. All told then, the value of tokens burned is more than $1 million. Add to that the buybacks the projects conduct in the open market every 20 minutes, which is now valued at $451,000, and the combined price-supportive activity has a substantial positive impact on the value of $SLAP tokens. Popcat turned a $100 meme coin investment into $282,679 and so can $SLAP $SLAP’s price is up 6,828% since it launched two weeks ago, and there is plenty more of that growth runway ahead ahead. Over the past seven days the $SLAP price has gone up 212%. Fellow cat meme coin Popcat, at its highest point since its Solana-based pump.fun listing, gained 282,679%. $100 invested in Popcat on pump.fun would have returned $282,679 today. Catslap runs on the second-most-valuable crypto network, Ethereum, and is poised to beat the performance of its feline competitor. SolidProof audited Catslap, and the project has a 99% project reliability score on DEXtools. Furthermore, the team has locked 53% of its $6.8 million liquidity on-chain for one month – so no need to worry about rug pulls. $SLAP is ready to pounce on the Popcats and Pepes of the crypto world in its quest for meme coin domination. This cat could have you purring all the way to the bank. The fast-growing Catslap community has 3,448 members on Telegram and 11,000 on X .

37252728,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316650,1733401517,Coinbase-Led Travel Rule Group Launches TRUSThub,"The Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST), backed by Coinbase, focused on developing an anti-money laundering system for crypto transactions, is launching TRUSThub to expand its reach. TRUST includes some of the largest virtual asset service providers (VASPs) including Baanx, Coinpass, Fidelity Digital Assets Ltd, Gemini Kraken and Revolut. A VASP is an organization or business that manages the transfer, exchange, safekeeping, or management of virtual assets such as cryptoon behalf of others. TRUST explains that as the regulatory landscape around virtual assets evolves the demand for information sharing among VASPs is critical. The group is launching a hub which it claims will be a “creative and efficient way” to navigate obstacles, including the ability to engage with counterparty VASPs who are not yet members of TRUST. TRUSThub Simplifies Compliance for Crypto Transactions TRUSThub is set to launch by the end of 2024. The new tool is designed to help VASPs meet Travel Rule compliance requirements. The system allows VASPs to share necessary transaction information, regardless of the tools they already use, while supporting global collaboration. When a user from a TRUST member sends funds to a non-TRUST VASP, TRUSThub will step in to locate the recipient’s contact details. It then sends the required compliance data through a protected system. This process will allow transactions to meet legal standards without slowing down or limiting operations for either party. TRUSThub to Handle Compliance on Large Orders The group said, one benefit of TRUSThub is its ability to handle compliance without disrupting large numbers of user transactions. The firms said the system will prioritize privacy by protecting sensitive user information. This allows TRUST members to maintain secure, and compliant operations when working across different networks. Once TRUSThub is available, it will be easier for TRUST members to navigate the changing rules around virtual asset transactions while continuing to provide services for their users. Changing Rules Around VASPs In November 2023, Gemini implemented changes in response to new regulations affecting VASPs in the UK. Gemini announced adjustments to align with the new Travel Rule regulations in the UK . The changes involved a set of global standards requiring financial institutions and VASPs to share information about senders and recipients of virtual assets. To achieve this, Gemini partnered with TRUST.

Multiple ecosystem developments, including on the regulatory front have the market buzzing, with Ethereum (ETH), Render (RENDER), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) among coins attracting massive attention. Here’s a market update for today as the global cryptocurrency market cap jumps to $3.8 trillion. Crypto in the news Ripple says that its stablecoin RLUSD has delayed its highly anticipated launch. The company is eyeing regulatory approval. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has noted that Trump’s pick of Paul Atkins as the next SEC chair is positive for the crypto market. According to Wood, this could spark new life into the digital assets space, untying the industry from Gary Gensler’s negative approach. On Wednesday, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Bitcoin is the digital gold and a competitor of the precious metal, not of the US dollar. This came as Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that Bitcoin is unstoppable. Bithumb, the second largest crypto exchange in South Korea, has announced support for NEIRO, MORPHO, and SUNDOG. The exchange will add Korean won pairs for these tokens on Dec. 5. Crypto price updates Top 10 cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) traded between lows of $94,870 and $103,679, currently 6% up. The 24-hour range for BTC sees a huge green candle on the day as the benchmark asset’s market cap crosses the $2 trillion mark. Analysts say BTC could target $120k with the next uptick, with Standard Chartered predicting prices could hit $200k by the end of 2025. Among the top 10 altcoins, Ethereum has spiked more than 5% to above $3,900 and could eye the $4,000 level. Most analysts are bullish on the ETH price. Meanwhile, Dogecoin leads gainers in this group with nearly 7% upside momentum in 24 hours. DOGE traded around $0.44. XRP, which has ripped in recent weeks, was down 9% to $2.38 amid the RLUSD delay news. Solana changed hands around $2.37, but barely in the green, while BNB had shed 6% to near $733. 24-hour top gainers As noted above, the cryptocurrency market is trading mixed as of writing. However, a few altcoins stand out on the day. In the top 100 by market cap, JasmyCoin (JASMY) is the top 24-hour performer with +26% to trade at $0.05056.

Positively, the technical indicators SMA & MACD continue recording bullish sentiment, hinting at a potential reversal. The HBAR altcoin is currently trading at a discount of 46.71% from its ATH of $0.5701. Despite Bitcoin price achieving the $100k mark and major altcoins recording a massive price rally, the Hedera price has experienced a major setback after repeatedly failing to break out of its important resistance level above the $0.337 mark.

37251537,https://crypto.news/?p=14316473,1733400708,Here’s what HashKey’s 30% token allocation for staff could mean for investors,"HashKey recently announced that it allocated 300 million tokens to team incentives with a 36-month unlocking period after the launch of its native token HSK. How does this impact investors? On Dec. 5, HashKey posted an official statement that explains the allocation of HSK tokens for team members. The notice stated that HashKey allocated 30% of its 1 billion token supply for the internal team which follows an unlocking period that consists of a minimum 3-month lock-up period and a 35-month linear release. “We’d like to clarify key aspects of HSK’s tokenomics and team incentives structure: HSK has a total supply of 1 billion tokens, with 300 million allocated for team incentives,” HashKey wrote in the firm’s official statement . HashKey said that the 30% token allocation for team members was done to support the growth of HashKey’s ecosystem. The firm claimed that the tokens will be used for licensed exchanges, investment services, tokenization and infrastructure solutions. Tokens can also be used for exchange fee payments, trading discounts and accessing community incentives. Therefore, current team members and former employees who hold HSK have to adhere to the firm’s token management policies, which regulate issuing, holding and selling tokens in accordance with the lock-up schedule. You might also like: Hong Kong’s HashKey announces new launch date for HSK native token Moreover, the Hong Kong -based crypto exchange clarified that employee resignation does not allow former team members to get an early or full token unlock. This is done to prevent former employees from cheating the system and selling tokens before the unlock period. As previously reported by crypto.news, HashKey first opened deposits for HSK on Nov. 7 at 07:00 UTC, while spot trading for the HSK/USDT pair started on Nov. 26 at 10:00 UTC. The opening of HSK withdrawals occurred on the next day, Nov. 27 at 10:00 UTC. In the initial announcement, the exchange explained that it had prepared a supply of 1 billion tokens, with 65% of the tokens being allocated to marketing and business development while 30% of the supply went to the HashKey team. What does the 30% HSK allocation for team members mean for investors? On one hand, allocation of tokens before a new launch is common practice in the crypto sphere. It is meant to incentivize team members and align their interests with the success of the project. That way, they will be more motivated to work harder to develop the project. In HashKey’s case, the 36-month linear release period suggests the team is committed to the project’s long-term development. The unlocking period also reduces the risk of a pump-and-dump happening, because team members are unable to sell tokens quickly to gain profit within the period. On the other hand, setting aside a chunk of the token supply for team members means that there are fewer tokens available in circulation. Usually when the portion reserved for insiders is too high, there will be higher pressure for insiders to sell tokens. When the lockup period ends and tokens start unlocking, the team could still potentially sell their tokens to realize profits, which would in turn increase supply and potentially lower prices. Therefore, investors would need to keep an eye on the unlocking timeline and the project’s development milestones. According to data from CoinGecko , HashKey’s platform token is down 9.4% in the past day. HSK is currently trading hands at $1.31 at the time of writing. In the past week, the token has gone up by nearly 20% and has a fully diluted valuation of $1.3 billion. Though, there is no information about how many tokens are circulating on the market right now.

37252952,https://invezz.com/?p=2370295,1733400274,"Interview: Crypto-AI intersection can achieve its true potential by addressing real business needs, says Dr. Li, OORT founder","The intersection of artificial intelligence and decentralized technologies has emerged as one of the most transformative frontiers in modern technology. As AI continues to reshape industries and challenge traditional computational paradigms, innovative approaches to infrastructure, data management, and computational resources are becoming increasingly critical. Decentralized AI represents a promising pathway to democratize access to advanced computational capabilities, addressing challenges of cost, scalability, and data privacy that have long constrained technological innovation. At the forefront of this technological revolution is Dr. Max Li, a visionary researcher and entrepreneur who has been pioneering groundbreaking solutions in the decentralized AI landscape. In this exclusive interview, Dr. Li will share his unique insights, revealing the intricate dynamics and potential of this emerging technological domain. Invezz: Tell us about yourself and your background. I have a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering and began my career working in Qualcomm’s R&D department, focusing on the development of 5G chipsets. For this interview, I’d like to share the serendipitous encounters that led me to the blockchain industry and where I am today. It all started in 2012 during Qualcomm research department’s weekly “Free Thinking Hour” on Fridays—a time set aside for brainstorming and exploring innovative ideas. On one of these Fridays, a colleague introduced the topic of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. They explained the concept of Proof of Work (PoW) and the underlying infrastructure. Intrigued, our group of researchers delved into the technological details and algorithms, and decided it was some lousy tech that was going nowhere. Then, we forgot about it and I did not have any interest in blockchain and crypto. Back then, BTC was around $10. Fast forward to 2017: the 2nd year of my time at Columbia University as a faculty member, teaching classes in engineering and computer science. Outside the academic sphere, the ICO boom was in full swing. At Columbia, we began receiving an overwhelming number of student inquiries and requests for a course on blockchain and cryptocurrency. Such a course with university credits didn’t exist anywhere in the United States at that time. I was tasked with creating this course from scratch—there was no syllabus, no materials, and no roadmap. To prepare, I pieced together knowledge from scattered online resources and deepened my understanding of the subject. That same year, Columbia’s first blockchain course was launched, one of the earliest of its kind in the US, alongside similar courses being introduced at Duke and Princeton. Invezz: Walk us through your personal journey of starting OORT. How did it begin and why? It all began with more serendipity. The idea for the decentralized AI platform “OORT” emerged during an AI course I taught in 2018. Columbia postgraduates were struggling to complete a project that required training AI agents because traditional cloud services, like those offered by Amazon and Google, were far too expensive for student budgets. This prompted us to explore leveraging blockchain as an incentive layer to create a more cost-effective decentralized cloud solution. What we did was utilize underutilized nodes globally and connect them through blockchain. Students could then access these resources and pay via PayPal, with a certain amount of credits allocated for student use. These credits became the “embryo” of what would later evolve into OORT’s native token. While this sounded exciting, it came with significant technological challenges. The concept was entirely new, and we were navigating uncharted territory, exploring and solving problems bit by bit. By the way, the course I’m referring to is Reinforcement Learning in AI . It’s based on the textbook I authored, Reinforcement Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems, published by Taylor & Francis CRC Press. Along the way, I published a few academic papers and US patents, for example, the development of the Proof of Honesty (PoH) system that OORT DataHub relies on. PoH is a human-in-the-loop auto-quality control mechanism. This system ensures immediate verification of the accuracy of collected data points, unlike traditional companies that take time to manually verify results, often missing errors. Invezz: OORT received a grant from Microsoft, can you give us more information about this? How did OORT stand out? The grant from Microsoft significantly supports our efforts in developing decentralized AI infrastructure. It also represents a mutually beneficial partnership. OORT stood out because our model is both practical and scalable. While there is a lot of hype and narratives around decentralized AI (DeAI), many are not practical for business use. This is where OORT has a strong advantage—we are a for-profit business with real-world solutions that deliver tangible results. Our solutions, such as OORT Storage and OORT AI, have already been adopted by over 10,000 clients, demonstrating their applicability and demand. Additionally, our ability to deliver viable products at scale played a key role in being selected for this grant. As a startup, gaining access to critical resources is essential for scaling our infrastructure. For example, through this grant, OORT receives free Azure server access to run key components of our infrastructure, which significantly enhances our operational capacity. In addition, we receive OpenAI technical support for our AI agent development. Invezz: OORT recently signed a 3-year contract with Githon Technology for customized AI solutions. Could you share insights on what this partnership means, and how it aligns with your vision of integrating AI into how we do business? The partnership with Githon Technology (formerly Lenovo Image) is an important milestone for OORT and the decentralized AI space. It highlights the growing demand for practical AI solutions in the Customer Support vertical—a vast market with significant untapped potential. Through this collaboration, we aim to pilot and implement a proof of concept that demonstrates how decentralized AI can enhance customer support operations with greater efficiency, privacy, and scalability. This partnership also validates OORT’s business viability, scalability, and the operational efficiency our solutions bring to clients. These qualities not only benefit Githon Technology but also set a standard for the broader industry, showcasing the real-world applicability of AI in business settings. For OORT, this partnership is a significant step toward integrating decentralized AI into core business processes in a way that is both impactful and scalable. It opens the door for future innovations while building a strong pipeline of opportunities in the customer support space and beyond. Invezz: We’ve seen a surge in funding for decentralized AI startups. How do you see this funding trend shaping the landscape of AI innovation, particularly in areas like infrastructure? The increase in funding for decentralized AI startups is exciting, but it also comes with challenges. One common issue is that many projects tend to chase hype rather than focus on solving real-world problems. This is something we’ve observed in other tech trends as well, such as drones, VR glasses, or purely feature-driven innovations. While the technology in these fields has advanced significantly, the critical question remains: What’s the business model? How does this generate sustainable revenue? In the decentralized AI space, we see a similar dynamic. The Web3 ecosystem often leans into hype and hot-money funding, while Web2 tends to focus on serious, business-driven strategies. For decentralized AI to truly shape the landscape of innovation, startups need to adopt a more thoughtful and practical approach—one that prioritizes problem-solving over buzzwords. At OORT, we continually ask ourselves how our solutions can address real market needs. This mindset ensures that we build scalable infrastructure and applications that are not just technologically innovative but also commercially viable. Looking ahead, we hope to see more startups applying this approach, focusing on creating value through practical and sustainable use cases rather than simply riding the wave of hype. Invezz: The crypto industry has shown growing interest in combining crypto and AI, with examples like Bitcoin miners repurposing rigs for AI tasks. How do you view this intersection, and do you see a viable pathway for profitable collaboration between these sectors? The intersection of crypto and AI presents significant potential for innovation and new business models. However, as I recently discussed in my Forbes column, while the pathway is promising, we should expect a fair share of failures in the near term as the sector experiences rapid growth and experimentation. The convergence of crypto and AI could indeed unlock possibilities for an unimaginable future. But the key question remains: “Where’s the real business?” For example, in decentralized AI (DeAI) cloud computing, success will depend less on the cost savings or access to massive processing power (which are the pitch points of most DeAI projects) and, instead, more on factors like the service reliability, scalability, and addressing real-world concerns that some are currently overlooking. For instance, rigs from the repurposed Bitcoin mining machines always have reliability and scalability concerns. At OORT, we’re committed to building solutions that address these practical needs. With OORT Storage and OORT DataHub, we’ve already established integral components for decentralized AI use cases. Soon, we’ll launch OORT Compute, which will further position us as a viable and competitive alternative to traditional Web2 cloud providers. This comprehensive approach not only supports the promise of DeAI but also ensures a sustainable and profitable trajectory for the sector. I’m genuinely excited about this direction, as it highlights the importance of focusing on meaningful applications and long-term value creation rather than simply riding the wave of hype. By addressing real business needs, the crypto-AI intersection can achieve its true potential. Invezz: As someone deeply involved in the decentralized AI space, where do you see the industry heading in the next five years? What role do you envision OORT playing in shaping the future of AI through decentralized networks? Let’s approach this from two perspectives. 1. AI as a Technology AI is set to enjoy significant longevity over the next five to 20 years. Much like smartphones, which have evolved over nearly a decade, AI will continue to advance, introducing new capabilities and features. While it may not always be on the cutting edge of public attention, it will remain a vibrant and integral part of technology and innovation. The longer the timeline, the more powerful and autonomous AI systems—such as advanced AI agents—we can expect to see. 2. Decentralized AI (DeAI) The future of DeAI is less certain, particularly when viewed over a 20-year horizon. Many factors could influence its trajectory, including technological advancements, evolving regulations, and geopolitical considerations. For instance, the challenge of managing truly global datasets that cross jurisdictions raises national security concerns and regulatory complexities. In five years, DeAI could either solidify its position or fade into the background as a passing trend. However, AI itself will undoubtedly persist and continue to shape industries. At OORT, we embrace the uncertainties of this space with excitement and determination. Navigating the DeAI landscape is like embarking on a grand voyage—there are unknowns, but the potential rewards are immense. As a first mover in this sector, OORT has a unique opportunity to lead the way. With solutions like OORT Storage, OORT DataHub, and the soon-to-be-launched OORT Compute, we aim to build the foundational infrastructure for decentralized AI, addressing real-world challenges and creating a viable path forward. While the journey ahead may be unpredictable, we’re committed to pushing the boundaries of what decentralized AI can achieve and shaping the future of AI through decentralized networks.

37251278,https://crypto.news/?p=14315781,1733400180,Five ways to tackle security risks in crypto transactions | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. As the crypto ecosystem grows, so do the challenges of securing digital assets. Phishing scams, malware, and sophisticated fraud schemes threaten users daily and create an urgent need for preventative solutions. You might also like: The future of crypto security: Trustless MPC is the next big thing | Opinion Decentralized private AI agents are the answer. They provide a truly innovative solution to combating risks by harnessing large language models and predictive analytics to detect fraud, prevent security breaches, and safeguard users in real time. Here’s how. 1. Identifying anomalous behavior with LLMs Large language models, known for their proficiency in understanding natural language, are becoming more commonly adapted for security roles in crypto––and with good reason. These models are ideal for spotting suspicious patterns in transaction data and identifying anomalies that signal fraud. For example, LLMs can analyze user behaviors, standard transaction amounts, and wallet activities to detect deviations from the norm quickly. This allows AI agents to flag potential scams, like phishing attempts or unusual withdrawals, well before funds are compromised. LLMs are constantly learning from a wide variety of inputs like past user behaviors, transaction histories, and even external market conditions and real time intelligence, allowing them to develop a refined sense of “normal” activity, which makes it increasingly difficult for hackers to bypass their intelligent systems. This ability to adapt is particularly valuable in crypto, where trading habits can vary widely, and fraudulent behavior follows certain patterns. LLMs are capable of evolving quickly with changing threats, which is crucial for keeping up with the dynamic crypto landscape. 2. Predictive analytics to assess and mitigate risks Predictive analytics, powered by AI agents, play a critical role in assessing the risk of each transaction. In fast-paced crypto trading, where assets can shift value in minutes and transactions are often irreversible, the stakes are high. Predictive models leverage historical data to forecast potential risks tied to specific trades, wallet addresses, or platforms, allowing users to make informed decisions. These analytics use indicators such as past scam wallet addresses, trends in phishing websites, and hacking attempts to assign risk scores to each transaction. For instance, an AI agent can recognize the security risk associated with an unfamiliar address tracked from known ongoing hacks and phishing before a transaction by cross-referencing it with security data in real time. It can alert the user to potential threats or even block the transaction altogether, significantly reducing the chance of funds falling into the hands of scammers. 3. AI agents in action: Real-time fraud prevention and alerts Beyond detection, decentralized private AI agents play an even more important role in preventing fraud by operating autonomously on both users’ devices and custody systems, assessing every transaction before it occurs. If an agent detects unusual behavior, like an attempt to transfer a large sum to an unverified address, it can instantly alert the user, request verification, or, if necessary, block the transaction entirely. This real-time functionality is critical in crypto, where transactions happen almost instantly. Unlike traditional financial systems, which often require time-consuming fraud investigations and response times, decentralized AI agents act within milliseconds to prevent breaches before they escalate. Plus, with localized operation, users benefit from increased privacy, as all data remains within the device, away from centralized servers where it could be vulnerable to attacks. 4. Localized operation An additional aspect of decentralized private AI agents is their ability to run locally on users’ wallets and custody systems rather than relying on cloud infrastructure. This design significantly enhances security and privacy, creating an invisible layer of protection. Externally, these AI agents appear as standard private crypto wallets, indistinguishable from any other. The fact that they house advanced AI capabilities is known only to the user. This operating mode makes it exceptionally difficult for attackers to identify and target wallets enhanced with these autonomous security features. Since the AI runs locally, hackers first need to locate the physical device hosting the wallet—an immensely challenging task due to its anonymity. Even if they succeed, they face the added complexity of breaching the wallet’s robust defenses, which are powered by LLMs and predictive analytics designed to counteract phishing, malware, and fraud. 5. Enhancing security with multi-layered insights LLMs add an extra layer of security by continuously cross-referencing external data sources, such as recent scam reports or new hacking techniques. In doing so, they generate insights that not only protect individual users but also help secure the entire crypto community. For example, if a new phishing technique or malware variant is detected in one part of the network, the AI can update its detection algorithms across all nodes to proactively warn users, enhancing network-wide security. Takeaways By integrating LLM-powered AI agents with predictive analytics, decentralized private AI solutions are reshaping crypto security. These agents not only detect and prevent fraud but also enhance user trust by enabling secure, private transactions. Their predictive capabilities allow users to approach crypto trading with more confidence, knowing that AI agents are constantly working on their behalf to assess and mitigate risks. Ultimately, private AI agents armed with LLMs and predictive analytics offer a next-gen approach to tackling the security challenges in crypto. By combining real-time fraud detection, proactive alerts, and risk assessment, these AI-driven tools allow users to trade and transact with peace of mind, setting a new standard for safety in the evolving digital economy.

42389613,69fe50c3-357b-4a5c-ac21-ee9ff1d7d475,1733400017,Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin's $100K+ Run Is Just Early Days,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  The wait is over. Bitcoin has surged past $100,000, driven by a number of factors, including President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of supposedly crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to lead the SEC.   Most analysts are bullish, anticipating further gains toward $120,000 and higher, and it's not hard to see why. As Newton's first law states, an object in motion maintains its speed and direction unless acted on by an outside force.  The wider market is poised to benefit from bitcoin's milestone, especially as the six-digit price may be too steep for many retail investors, prompting them to consider alternative cryptocurrencies.  Ether, in particular, is likely to benefit because the spread between the Ethereum staking yield and the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury has narrowed recently, with the Treasury's return dropping to 4.2% from 4.5% in the past two weeks. Note, however, that a whale address moved 11,753 ETH to exchanges in the past 24 hours, raising price volatility risks.  Additionally, the Bitcoin layer-2 network Stacks' STX token is gaining considerable attention on social media, with one observer referring to the SEC-compliant token as a ""de facto BTC staking provider."" STX has surged 56% this quarter, though at $2.80 it remains well below its record $3.84. Keep an eye on this one.   In traditional markets, BTC's rise has lifted spirts of crypto-related equities, with self-described bitcoin development company MicroStrategy up over 6% in pre-market trading. Copycat Semler Scientific has gained over 7% and MARA Holdings more than 6%.  Still, there are several external forces that may stall BTC's momentum.   ""Risks are centered around escalating conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, along with dramatic shifts in interest rate expectations from the Fed,"" trading firm Zerocap's CIO Jonathan de Wet told CoinDesk, adding that the Fed's potential hawkish turn next year may take the wind out of BTC's sails.   Sergei Gorev, head of risk at YouHodler, said risks could emerge from an ""overheated"" S&P 500.   ""While the price increase may continue, it likely won’t be significant,"" he said. Many"" technical indicators suggest a potential correction, prompting algorithmic traders to seek entry points for short positions to address divergences on the charts.""  Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, and several others say the crypto market itself looks overheated and is at risk of correction.   ""The Fear and Greed Index has climbed above 80, signaling extreme greed among investors. Smaller-cap assets are seeing explosive gains, drawing in retail participants eager to capitalize on the bull run. While this strategy could be lucrative, it carries significant risks in such unpredictable conditions,"" Fournier told CoinDesk.   So, stay alert out there!

Viral sensation Haliey Welch launched a token on Solana late Wednesday. The token, backed by a management team, a foundation in the Cayman Islands, and a SAFT agreement with private investors who all claimed to ensure the longevity of HAWK — a token themed after Welch’s popular “hawk tuah” catchphrase.  The token initially saw its market cap soar to $490 million before dramatically crashing to less than $40 million with 20 minutes.  The wild price action drew parallels to a classic “rug pull,” or a token that benefits early buyers by pumping several multiples after issuance only to drop more than 90% in the hours or days afterward.  On-chain sleuths such as Bubblemaps allege over 96% of HAWK tokens were held in a single cluster — or a collection of related wallets — that sold tokens when prices rose.  Welch and her team have responded to some of these allegations, denying that insiders sold tokens at launch and claiming that the initial high trading fees were implemented to prevent snipers — or bots that purchase large amounts of a token after issuances to corner supply.  Several messages sent to Welch’s team to shed light on the allegations were unanswered in Asian hours.  Derivatives Positioning  The market looks overheated and faces pullback risks, with BTC's perpetual funding rates more expensive than those of speculative tokens such as DOGE.  Traders are increasingly focusing on ETH, as evidenced by the new high of 6.86 million ETH in ether futures and perpetual futures open interest. BTC's OI is yet to confirm the new spot-price high.  BTC calls, however, are more expensive than ETH on Deribit, according to 24-delta risk reversals sourced from Amberdata. Long dealer gamma at the $105,000 strike options suggests potential for range play.  BTC, ETH options flows mostly leaned bullish, but a large block trade saw an ETH trader sell the December expiry straddle at $3,800, collecting over $2 million in premium. Selling straddle represents expectations for price consolidation and volatility drop.

While You Were Sleeping  Traders See Even More Bitcoin Buying Pressure as BTC Sets New Record at $103K (CoinDesk): Bitcoin crossed $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, reaching $103,670 before easing to $102,500. The 50 percent monthly gain reflects higher institutional interest, record ETF inflows, growing acceptance from traditional finance and optimism about Donald Trump’s presidency, which is expected to create a more favorable environment for bitcoin in the United States.   Euro’s Outlook Gets Even Murkier After French Government Falls (Bloomberg): The euro faces pressure after Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s government was ousted in a no-confidence vote, increasing fears of political instability and fiscal uncertainty in France. Rising borrowing costs, a widening deficit, and uncertainty over the budget are compounding risks for the single currency, which has fallen 2.7% against the dollar since June.   South Korea President Replaces Defence Minister and Battles Impeachment (Financial Times): South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol accepted Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun’s resignation on Thursday amid backlash over the failed attempt to impose martial law.

Binance's BNB Hits Fresh Record, Breaks Out of 3-Year Range as Altcoin Rotation Accelerates (CoinDesk): BNB, the native token of the BNB Chain, climbed to an all-time high of $793 on Wednesday, driven by growing interest in altcoins and hopes for Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. The rally was also supported by reduced regulatory pressure on Binance, token supply cuts through burns, and rising activity on the BNB Chain.   Dovish BOJ Member Strikes Cautious Tone on Inflation, Wages (The Wall Street Journal): Bank of Japan board member Toyoaki Nakamura downplayed expectations for an imminent rate hike, citing doubts about reaching the 2 percent inflation target.

37251172,https://finbold.com/?p=216991,1733399941,"$8 billion of BTC shorts at risk as Bitcoin climbs toward $110,000","After a relatively protracted stagnation between approximately $94,000 and about $99,000, Bitcoin ( BTC ) finally broke above $100,000 late on Wednesday, December 4, and even almost climbed to $104,000 during the upswing. Though such a move is undoubtedly good for BTC bulls and ensures the majority of long positions are in the green, it bodes ill for those investors who wagered the world’s premier cryptocurrency could not sustain the positive momentum. Specifically, at press time on December 5, $110,000 is shaping up to be a highly painful level for those who bet Bitcoin’s price will drop. Approximately $8 billion worth of shorts will be liquidated once it is reached, according to data retrieved by Finbold from CoinGlass on Thursday. Bitcoin price and liquidation chart. Source: CoinGlass Furthermore, data from the same platform reveals that a significant portion of traders could be adversely affected by a continued Bitcoin rally as the long-short ratio has been roughly even in the last 30 days, indicating investors have been as keen to bet against the coin as they have been interested in betting on BTC.

No matter the next step BTC faces, the December 4 and December 5 rally ensured the coin is up 6.20% in the last 24 hours, 7.83% in the last week, and a staggering 48.96% in the green in the last 30 days. Bitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold The most recent move was, by all accounts, driven by two separate events in the political sphere on Wednesday. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell rejected the notion that Bitcoin is a competitor to the American dollar but, in the same motion, lent it credence by likening the digital asset to the world’s biggest commodity: gold. On the same day, former president and President-Elect Donald Trump unveiled Paul Atkins as his pick for the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair. As a co-chair of the Token Alliance , a pro-cryptocurrency lobbying group, Atkins starkly contrasts the current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, who is widely seen as a villain inside the community. The two latest developments come amidst an overall bullish shift in attitude that emerged from Trump’s re-election. The incoming Republican administration is considered better for business, trading, and digital assets by most investors and is set to bring numerous pro-crypto individuals into power. Furthermore, some of the departures from the U.S. government have themselves proven powerful tailwinds for various coins and tokens in the cryptocurrency market , with Gensler’s announced January 20 resignation driving a particularly strong rally for XRP .

37251024,https://finbold.com/?p=216987,1733399683,Here’s how much NYC mayor Eric Adams is up on his Bitcoin bet,"Cryptocurrencies have gone a long way from an obscure asset class to a mainstream investment. Along that way, they have unsurprisingly become a topic of political discussion. The debates span more than just regulations — in recent times, the stances taken toward digital assets are becoming more and more of a chasm between the two major political parties in the United States — the Democrats and the Republicans. It comes as little surprise that Republicans are broadly supportive of the new asset class. A focus on deregulation and free market principles meshes well with cryptocurrency. Likewise, it’s not exactly shocking that Democrats, who usually favor stricter regulation, are lagging behind their rivals in terms of crypto adoption. There are outliers, of course — Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, for instance, is perhaps the highest-ranked Democrat to voice pro-crypto opinions . He’s not the earliest adopter in his party, however — that title most likely belongs to Eric Adams, the controversial mayor of New York. Back in 2022, Adams was the target of widespread mockery over his decision to receive his first three paychecks in the form of Bitcoin ( BTC ). In an event at the America LGBTQ+ Museum on December 3, the mayor of the ‘Big Apple’ reflected on that period — and seems to have gotten the last laugh. Here is how much those three paychecks could be worth right now. Adams received a tidy sum of Bitcoin back in 2022 Before actually taking office, then mayor-elect Adams announced his intention to receive payments in the form of BTC in early late 2021. As of early January that year, Adams had not yet received his first paycheck, as covered by Finbold . Once taxes are taken into account, each check would have netted Adams roughly $10,000, per publicly available data . He assumed office on January 1 — so for the sake of simplicity, we will assume he received his first check on February 1 — and subsequent checks on March 1 and April 1 of 2022. At the time of the first check, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $38,650. On March 1 2022, the leading digital asset had a price of $43,230, and at the time of the third paycheck, it was trading at $45,530. At press time, BTC was trading at $102,632. BTC price YTD chart. Source: Google Finance Now let’s compare that price with the prices at the time Adams was paid. The price of the premier cryptocurrency has rallied by 165.54%, 137.40%, and 125.41%, respectively since then. The average gain is thus 142.78% on an investment worth $30,000 — in other words, Adams’ BTC is now worth roughly $72,834, a gain of $42,834.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/doge-christmas-dogechris-solana-memecoin-to-explode-15000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Accordingly, BIT Mining announced that its strategy of focusing on mining Dogecoin and Litecoin is three times more profitable than mining Bitcoin alone. BIT Mining, which previously only mined Bitcoin, started mining Dogecoin and Litecoin in May 2023. The company stated that it had mined cryptocurrencies worth a total of $105.5 million by November 27.

BIT Mining Vice President and Chief Economist Dr. Youwei Yang also stated the following in his statement: “According to the announced figures, mining LTC and DOGE has proven to be almost three times more profitable than mining BTC alone. “The changing regulatory environment in the US, particularly following Elon Musk's influence and Donald Trump's victory, has had a major impact on mining profitability.” BIT Mining currently has over 5,550 active machines capable of mining Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Bellscoin (BEL), representing 1.32% of the total network hashrate for these three altcoins, making it one of the largest participants. *This is not investment advice.

The initiative, totaling $750 million includes a $500 million at-the-market (ATM) program and a $250 million stock buyback plan. Hut 8’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Initiative Hut 8’s CEO, Asher Genoot, articulated the company’s vision, stating that the launch of the new ATM Program and Stock Repurchase Program has equipped the business with “two powerful tools” that he believes bolsters the firm’s ability to endure the market’s volatility. Related Reading: BNB Surges 18% To Hit Record High Close To $800: Is Further Growth On The Horizon? The ATM program will allow Hut 8 to sell its common stock directly in the market, providing flexibility to raise funds as needed. In contrast, the stock buyback plan demonstrates the company’s confidence in its long-term growth prospects. Genoot emphasized that these financial maneuvers send a clear message to investors about their belief in Hut 8’s potential and its approach to treasury management. The net proceeds from the ATM program are earmarked for several growth initiatives. This includes investing in power and digital infrastructure, acquiring data centers, and purchasing Bitcoin to bolster its strategic reserve. Additionally, the funds may be allocated for general corporate purposes, such as repaying debts and enhancing working capital. Growing Trend Among Crypto And Traditional Financial Firms Sales under the ATM program will adhere to the guidelines outlined in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be conducted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Hut 8 disclosed it has filed the necessary prospectus and supplementary documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ensure full compliance with regulatory requirements. The stock repurchase initiative is part of Hut 8’s broader capital management strategy. It allows the company to buy back up to 4.68 million shares, representing about 5% of its outstanding stock, over the next year. Importantly, both programs provide Hut 8 the flexibility to adjust their strategies based on market conditions, share prices, and regulatory requirements.

Gox-related wallet activities once again captured attention with a massive transfer of 27,871 BTC, worth around $2.8 billion, to an unidentified address on December 4. This transaction coincided with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high above $100,000, marking a historic moment for the cryptocurrency. Analytics from Arkham Intelligence reveal that the wallet, tied to the long-defunct exchange, still holds 39,878 BTC worth over $4 billion. This latest movement follows a prior transfer of 2,500 BTC in mid-November, which is amidst the ongoing repayment process for Mt. Gox. In July this year, the Mt. Gox trustee confirmed that the company had started repaying creditors using Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The process required creditors to verify their accounts and register with one of several designated crypto exchanges to facilitate the distribution. Initially, repayments were set to be completed by October 2024, but the deadline was recently extended to October 31, 2025. The extension was attributed to several factors, including incomplete procedures by many creditors and a system error that led to “double deposits” for some, prompting requests for repayment of the excess funds. Historically, such wallet activities have stirred bearish market sentiments; however, Bitcoin’s recent price trajectory suggests otherwise. The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $103,000 with a 6% daily gain. Its performance in the past weeks has resulted in broader market optimism despite potential liquidity risks, and experts believe that macro outlooks depict a bullish picture for Bitcoin. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Maple Finance co-founder Joe Flanagan said, “Today is a key moment for the crypto industry, driven by improved regulations and growing institutional interest. Bitcoin’s rise above $100,000 highlights the positive momentum from recent events, including Trump’s pro-crypto SEC chair appointment. This marks the start of a transformative phase, not just a recovery. As we look ahead to 2025, new projects, traditional finance adoption, and blockchain innovation will pave the way for growth. The groundwork being laid now promises exciting opportunities and real-world applications that will shape the future of the industry.

The agency revealed on December 5 that the sum includes $2.6 billion in civil monetary penalties and $14.5 billion in disgorgement and restitution. The bulk of the recovery stemmed from the CFTC’s crackdown on the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, which collapsed in November 2022. FTX Accounted for $12.7 Billion The FTX case alone accounted for $12.7 billion, marking the largest recovery in CFTC history. The litigation targeted the exchange, its sister firm Alameda Research, and key executives, including founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The settlement involved $8.7 billion in restitution for victims and $4 billion in disgorgement.

The agency recovered $150 million directly from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and imposed $1.35 billion in civil monetary penalties on the company. Binance was also ordered to pay an additional $1.35 billion in disgorgement as part of the settlement. Other notable cases included action against Voyager’s former CEO, Stephen Ehrlich, who was charged with commodity pool fraud and regulatory violations. In another ruling, the CFTC secured a judgment against Seneca Ventures, a fraudulent Ponzi-like scheme that misappropriated funds through crypto derivatives and carbon offset programs. The defendants were ordered to pay $110.9 million in penalties, $83.7 million in restitution, and $36.9 million in disgorgement. The agency also tackled a romance scam involving $2.3 million in misappropriated customer funds intended for digital asset commodity trading. “Misconduct in our jurisdictional markets is rarely confined, especially as these boundaries are continually being redefined by disruptive technology,” CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said. Trump is Considering Atkins to Take Over the SEC As Ctyptonews reported earlier , President-elect Donald Trump is considering selecting Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Atkins, who previously served under SEC chairs Richard Breeden and Arthur Levitt, is “crypto savvy” and has a “deep understanding of the inner workings of the agency.” Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, has regularly vowed to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework upon returning to the Oval Office. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players. A coalition of seven U.S. states has come together to challenge the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulation of cryptocurrency. The states have filed an amicus brief, led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, arguing that the SEC’s attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies constitutes a “power grab” that would stifle innovation, harm the crypto industry, and exceed the agency’s authority. The coalition includes Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, with Oklahoma becoming the latest state to join.

Not only did the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization soar through $100,000 during Asia trading hours, reaching a record $104,000, it's also at an all-time high when priced in gold, worth about 39 ounces, breaking through the last remaining resistance level for that trading pair. It has also hit records against silver and the S&P 500.  The price action means bitcoin is now an over-$2 trillion asset class, with its sights on overtaking Google (GOOG), whose market cap is $2.14 trillion, and Amazon (AMZ) at $2.29 trillion. That would happen if it hit $115,000 a token and make it the fifth-largest global asset.  Where to from here?

XRP price gained momentum in the last 7 days, soaring to levels not seen in years while the wider market traded sideways. The Gary Gensler-led SEC remained a loggerhead with the crypto market, following a series of hostile regulatory methods. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Garlinghouse suggested that Gary Gensler’s announced exit from the Commission has bolstered investor sentiments. The co-founder of Solana Labs Anatoly Yakovenko wrote that Ripple’s win against the SEC was the fatal wound against crypto adding that the XRP army bows to no one. In his reply, Garlinghouse stated, “ after Gensler, all boats rise.” SEC Negative Impact on Crypto The Biden administration was popularly termed a “war” with crypto assets because of the regulatory onslaught heaped on the industry. The lack of policy direction and regulation by the enforcement strategy of the SEC weakened sentiments and plunder investments. Frequent lawsuits also constituted roadblocks to wide asset adoption. Notably, the case against Ripple and its two executives reduced the asset’s growth, as it traded below $1 for more than a year. XRP bulls criticized the SEC over its lack of proper rules on the sector, leaving the United States behind other jurisdictions. Ripple’s Legal Chief Stuart Alderoty restated the facts that the financial regulator’s action lowered market activity. “ Turns out, the only ‘efforts of others’ that truly moved crypto markets—by causing massive and prolonged artificial suppression—were those of the SEC.” XRP Bullish Price Action The price of XRP has surged to levels not recorded in several months due to on-chain and industry factors .

37250098,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623085,1733397567,Phantom wallet is safe from the Solana supply chain attack,"Phantom wallet is safe, despite speculations it may have been compromised as part of a Solana supply chain attack. Solana users were exposed after malicious code was injected into a Web3 JS library for Solana. Phantom wallet announced that it was not affected by the Solana supply chain attack, which was discovered in one of the open-source Web3 libraries. The wallet did not report any exploits on its side, although an unknown number of users may have been affected. The wallet itself does not use any of the compromised versions. Phantom is not impacted by this vulnerability. Our Security Team confirms that we have never used the exploited versions of @solana/web3.js https://t.co/9wHZ4cnwa1 — Phantom (@phantom) December 3, 2024 Solana builders and users may have been exposed to two malicious versions of web3.js, 1.95.6 and 1.96.7. The earlier version is safe, as well as an upgrade to version 1.95.8. The attack was noticed on December 2 and it affected apps, bots, and custodial services. The widely used library contained code that requested and broadcast private keys, thus compromising user wallets. Based on the records of the Anza development firm, the account was exposed for around 5 hours on December 2, which limited the number of potential downloads during that time window. The suspected versions were immediately unpublished, but apps and projects may have their multisig or other credentials exposed. For now, there is no data about any major Solana apps or accounts changing their wallets or storage. The last transaction to the exploiter wallet was from December 3, further suggesting the exploit affected a limited number of users. In the meantime, one of the identified wallets is moving funds to a new account with a high balance of SOL and other assets, including Jupiter (JUP). The new account has been identified as a high-balance wallet by Nansen. None of the proceeds from the hack have been traded or disguised, as with other hacks. Limited gains from Solana wallets drained in exploit While far-reaching, the attack did not seem to affect high-value wallets. The identified exploiter wallet withdrew around $160K in SOL and nine tokens valued at $31,300. The attacker ended up testing wallets with billions of transaction requests, suggesting there may be many more unknown affected wallets. One of the reasons for the limited exploit haul is that the Solana network still has more than 35% failure rate for its transactions. However, the attempts suggest the exploiter may have gained more private keys through exposed apps. The attack happened through a social engineering attack, which allowed the malicious actors to gain access to the web3.js library depository. Reportedly, the project’s builders received a phishing link where the attackers requested and gained access. The malicious dataset has been flagged and is available for researchers through GitHub. Supply chain attacks emerged in the past year, with Lottie player also used as a vector to gain access to wallets. However, a direct targeting of private keys is a more rare type of attack. In the case of Solana apps, the exploiter managed to obtain private keys since some apps also required the same information for legitimate purposes. While most Solana apps have proven safe, the recent influx of new retail users is exposing some of the potential vulnerabilities. Responsibility for code dependencies and usage lies with projects. With fast building, the web3.js library has been downloaded more than 350K to 400K times in a week, leading to wider potential exposure. Solana wallet attacks are a key risk Solana drainers are becoming more active, and one of the few things that prevents bigger exploits is the fact that most wallets still contain under 1 SOL. One of the risks is that once exposed to a drainer, a Solana wallet is always at risk. Solana wallets also cannot revoke their permissions as in Ethereum. The Solana network is still not as heavily exploited as Ethereum, but has a prevalence of attacks against personal wallets. One of the vectors include Telegram, which can be connected to a Solana wallet for bot usage or easier trading. Using the same Telegram credentials also means that the wallet may be exposed and drained by malicious apps. The best approach is to use a dedicated wallet for storage, and another one for Web3 tasks.

The price of Bitcoin pierced through the sell wall to hit a new record high above $103,000 amid positive crypto news. Meanwhile, as several altcoins nudged higher amid the bullish sentiment, iDEGEN marked another milestone as its token sale attracted buyers. Bitcoin hits $103 amid SEC chair news With news that Donald Trump had picked pro-crypto former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins as the next SEC chair, Bitcoin price surged to a new all-time high of $103,679. The more than 7% spike also helped several altcoins higher, with gains for Ethereum to above $3,800 and Bitcoin Cash to above $611. Bitcoin’s surging run has the flagship cryptocurrency now up more than 140% in the past year. The digital asset continues to attract institutional money and analysts say the return of retail buyers could signal further gains. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher predicts that BTC could go on to target $120k. The analyst posted on X : “The ideal scenario for $BTC would be closing above on the daily, consolidating for a few days between 100 -105, then smashing to $120k.” iDEGEN: Analyst says AI agent to see action The crypto market has been bullish since President-elect Donald Trump won re-election in November. On Wednesday, Trump picked Paul Atkins as the next SEC chair to replace Gary Gensler. While the market anticipated the move following earlier reports , confirmation of the selection late Wednesday helped catalyze BTC’s uptick. Now analysts say the rest of the market could be about to go parabolic. Investors who might have missed the early trend will pile into coins that promise huge gains. Memecoins and AI tokens stand out as among the sectors poised for fresh rallying, with analysts saying it’s just a start for the latter.

AI agents can do pretty much anything. Look at what Terminal of Truth and Zerobro have recently shown with Goateus Maximus (GOAT) and ZEROBRO respectively. GOAT rose more than 7,000% after ToT posted about the meme coin. The iDEGEN project is taking this to the next level with an agent “AI born but degen raised”. What it means is that rather than come loaded with AI wits for all manner of sh*tposting, iDEGEN is a blank slate getting its training from degens on X – all from scratch. iDEGEN will learn everything it will ever know from the training and interactions it masters from degens. The AI agent posts every 60 minutes, replying to every mention and tag as it grows its knowledge of the crypto degen market. Investors eyeing the next GOAT token are thus buying IDGN. The native iDEGEN token is currently available via a dynamic auction. The presale has so far raised $2.3 million, with over 415 million tokens sold. The $IDGN price is $0.00636. Interested in iDEGEN?

Gox shifted over 27,000 Bitcoins, valued at $2.8 billion, to an unknown wallet address on Dec. 5, sparking concerns about the potential market implications of the transfer. The latest transfer came shortly after the benchmark crypto climbed past the long-awaited $100,000 mark. Mt. Gox Moves 27,000 BTC According to data tracked by on-chain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, Mt. Gox moved 27,871 BTC (worth $2.82 billion) from its cold wallet storage to an unknown address with no previous history: 1N7jWmv63mkMdsYzbNUVHbEYDQfcq1u8Yp. Mt. Gox’s transfer came approximately 12 minutes after Bitcoin breached the highly anticipated $100,000 price level on Wednesday and less than 30 minutes before the apex crypto hit an all-time high of $103,679, according to CoinGecko data. At the beginning of 2024, BTC was valued at just over $44K. It has since rocketed by over 122%, frequently smashing its high price record throughout November but falling just short of $100,000 until now. The prospect of a genuinely crypto-friendly regulatory government under the incoming Donald Trump administration has added fuel to the fire lit by the successful spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now trading on Wall Street. While it’s unclear whether the latest transfer is part of Mt. Gox’s future distributions to creditors, such movements in the past have been viewed as bearish for Bitcoin. This is because it could indicate that billions worth of BTC are headed to creditors who might liquidate after waiting over a decade to get their holdings returned. However, Bitcoin was unfazed by Mt. Gox’s latest BTC transfer, trading at $102,813 at press time. Wednesday’s outflow follows a previous movement of 2,500 BTC (worth about $222 million) to an unknown wallet on Nov. 12. The Mt. Gox trustee extended the deadline to repay creditors by a whole year to Oct. 31, 2025, explaining that some claimants had not yet received their repayments after failing to complete the necessary repayment procedures.

Two Top Analysts Reveal Their Expectations!","Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed the historic $100,000 level this morning for the first time nearly 15 years after its launch. BTC has gained over 6% in the last 24 hours and has also reached a market value of $2 trillion for the first time. At this point, while it is wondered whether the rise will continue, two analysts evaluated the current rise and future price movements. Speaking to Coindesk, Presto Research investment analyst Min Jung stated that the statements of FED Chairman Jerome Powell and the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chairman pushed Bitcoin above $100,000. “With Powell's positive comment that Bitcoin is digital gold and Paul Atkins' appointment as SEC chairman, BTC finally hits 100k. Since BTC has long been expected to surpass $100,000, we predict that the rally will continue. “Furthermore, BTC remains small compared to other macro assets. At this point, Bitcoin's continued growth in market cap will now attract the attention of more large institutions and more investment.” BTSE COO Jeff Mei also evaluated the rise of Bitcoin and explained his expectations. “Bitcoin breaking the $100,000 barrier is not just a milestone; it represents a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Confidence is being spurred by an increasingly favorable regulatory environment in the U.S., particularly with the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chairman. This is likely to encourage more institutional investment in the sector, give Bitcoin more credibility and lead to a new wave of adoption,” said Jeff Mei. He said that some think $100,000 is the peak for Bitcoin, but given the on-chain demand and macroeconomic indicators, Bitcoin still has plenty of momentum to push even higher. *This is not investment advice.

The ETH community enjoys a bullish comeback after months of sluggish price momentum, and they continue adding more bullish altcoins to portfolios for extended gains. Polygon (POL) is a major buy for the ETH community as the project’s rebrand and bullish price potential can soon surpass the Ethereum price trend. Another crypto the ETH community is bagging is DTX Exchange (DTX). Both Polygon (POL) and DTX Exchange (DTX) are well-positioned to display a sky-high rally with rising investment inflows. Ethereum Price Rocket Launches With Stellar 52% Monthly Surge Ethereum price has recorded a ground-breaking rally this week as Bitcoin dominance charts have started to drop in favor of the ETH products. Including ETH ETFs, Ethereum-based products have reached $2.2 billion in 2024, the highest since $2 billion in 2021. This bullish market shift has made the price of Ethereum break the ceilings with a 52% monthly surge. Source: CoinMarketCap Furthermore, the Ethereum price has also reacted to Vitalik Buterin’s recent news about increasing the ETH wallet’s security through optimized gas payments and QR code standardization. This has put the Ethereum price on the road to crossing the $4,000 price point this month with a bullish comeback as buyers find early entry points for high returns. Polygon (POL) Rules Trader Wallets With $1 Price Target Next Polygon (POL) has displayed an impressive comeback after a long, volatile period since its POL 2.0 upgrade. However, the bullish market forces have again shown their trust in Polygon (POL) in this bullish phase, as on-chain data has reported a 1 million POL transfer to a crypto market maker’s wallet this week. This transaction highlights the community’s rising confidence in the Polygon (POL) price prospects in this bull run after a 138% rally in the last 30 days. That’s why traders accumulate large amounts of Polygon (POL) as the crypto analysts have forecasted a $1 rally this month amid surging Ethereum price, signaling promising entry points for higher investment returns. DTX Exchange Sets Stage For 1000% Price Explosion After Launch DTX Exchange (DTX) leads the crypto sector with its innovative and ground-breaking approach towards trading with its next-gen and advanced trading platform. DTX Exchange is the first to merge crypto and stock trading pairs with 1000x leverage and native hybrid layer-1 blockchain with a 10,000 TPS performance record. The hybrid DTX platform has redefined trading with advanced automation and the inclusion of 120k+ trading instruments across forex, cryptos, equities, commodities, bonds, and CFDs. The project has raised over $9.4 million in batch 6 of its public presale and is all set to announce its mainnet launch within the next few weeks, which could pump its price 1000% within months. The decentralized security protocols give DTX Exchange a major edge over existing platforms as the project solves hacking concerns and adds surplus liquidity for trading, which is a major concern for DEXs. Available at $0.12, this might be the final opportunity for traders to acquire DTX tokens early and enjoy bullish returns after its exchange listing. Conclusion While Ethereum price continues to rally for the $4K level, ETH holders are actively adding DTX Exchange (DTX) and Polygon (POL) because of their bullish potential this season. Both cryptos are ready to break ceilings and yield 300% returns this month amid sky-high trader volume and favorable market conditions, emerging as best picks for traders this season.

37249558,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623078,1733396346,Crypto miner Mawson pushed into bankruptcy court by creditors,"Mawson Infrastructure Group, a company known for its role in building data centers for Bitcoin miners and artificial intelligence, is under attack from creditors. With its cash reserves falling below $6 million, creditors in Australia, including W Capital Advisors and Marshall Investments, have filed a Chapter 11 petition in Delaware. The creditors claim the mining firm owes over 13.5 million Australian dollars ($8.7 million). The filing , made on Wednesday, wants to legally push the company into bankruptcy. While Mawson fights for its survival, its stock surged 54% in after-hours trading following confusion over whether the company had already filed for bankruptcy. Mawson clarified the situation in a statement, denying any voluntary filing and insisting it “expects to continue to operate as usual.” Manning’s role in Mawson’s issues and ongoing investigations The battle is about more than just unpaid debts. Mawson has accused W Capital Advisors of having questionable ties to James Manning, a former executive and board member at the company. Mawson claims Manning’s involvement raises serious ethical concerns, as W Capital is acting as trustee for the W Capital Advisors Fund, a creditor pursuing the Chapter 11 case. The company’s audit committee is currently investigating Manning’s dealings with W Capital and other related entities. Allegations include self-dealing and interference in business operations, adding more complexity to the legal drama. Manning’s ties to Vertua Property Inc. have also come under scrutiny. Vertua, another company connected to Manning, faces accusations of breaching contracts and interfering with Mawson’s business relationships. Mawson filed a complaint against Vertua in Pennsylvania’s Court of Common Pleas. The company accuses Vertua, its landlord for a Sharon, PA property, of breaching their lease agreement, wrongfully terminating the lease, and causing significant disruption to its business. Mawson is seeking damages, reinstatement of the lease, and reimbursement for litigation costs in this case, filed under docket number 2024-2332. The company argues that the Chapter 11 petition is part of a broader strategy to pressure it during ongoing litigation, so it is pushing back hard.

Set to debut on December 9, the initiative aims to seamlessly integrate DeFi opportunities into Binance’s centralized ecosystem, with Babylon BTC Staking serving as its inaugural offering. By simplifying access to DeFi yield opportunities, Binance continues to blur the lines between centralized finance (CeFi) and DeFi, making blockchain protocols more accessible to a broader audience. It Begins With Babylon Binance’s On-Chain Yields program, incorporated under the Binance Earn umbrella, is designed to demolish the technical barriers that have long kept DeFi at arm's length for the average crypto enthusiast. The program's maiden offering with Babylon Protocol represents more than just another yield farming opportunity: it's a calculated assault on the complexity that has empirically prevented mainstream adoption of DeFi’s greatest opportunities. The numbers tell a compelling story. Decentralized finance has ballooned into a $140 billion sector, yet the vast majority of potential users have been locked out by intimidating technical hurdles or simply an unwillingness to learn the ropes. Just $3.5 billion is currently held in Bitcoin protocols – a drop in the ocean that represents massive untapped potential. Binance's approach is deceptively simple. The initial program offers a limited quota of 1,000 BTC for staking, with users earning Babylon Points that track their on-chain activity. But beneath this straightforward offering lies a powerful concept: bringing the intricate world of DeFi directly into a user-friendly, centralized platform. Y’All Want Some Yield Farming? Traditionally, yield farming has been the domain of crypto-savvy traders capable of navigating a labyrinth of networks, gas tokens, and bridge protocols. These digital pioneers have long understood the potential of on-chain yields, but for the average investor, the path has been blocked by a wall of technical complexity. Binance is effectively building a ladder over that wall. By handling the technical considerations such as gas fees and smart contract interaction, it’s opening a gateway for millions of users who previously viewed DeFi as an impenetrable fortress. The move transforms DeFi from an exclusive club into a widely accessible marketplace. Critics might argue that this approach compromises the decentralized ethos of blockchain. But pragmatists will recognize it for what it is: a necessary evolution that brings sophisticated financial tools to a broader audience. Not everyone wants to become a blockchain ninja simply to pocket attractive yields. Babylon Brings BTC Staking to the Table Babylon Protocol is emerging as a key player in the growing Bitcoin staking sector, aiming to unlock the untapped potential of BTC in DeFi. As Babylon puts it, its staking solution means users can “Say goodbye to the risk of bridging, wrapping, or pegging your bitcoin.” It might seem unorthodox to be staking an asset that is part of a network secured by Proof of Work – not Proof of Stake. But Babylon has shown that where there’s a will, there’s a way to build powerful DeFi primitives on Bitcoin infrastructure. While the success of the On-Chain Yields program remains to be seen, one thing is certain: Binance is betting big on making DeFi not just accessible, but irresistible to the average investor. And if the platform's track record is any indication, they're more likely to succeed than not. Greater on-chain yields are coming. And this time, everyone's invited.

As Bitcoin made a new all time high, sui followed to do so. Since the US election Sui has surged by 118% creating a new all time high. To understand what has been happening with this altcoin and what is next, let’s explore the charts. Sui’s Journey to ATH Since August, Sui has given 760% returns to its believers. It has been among the altcoins with best returns this year. For around a month it has been moving in a confined zone between $1.84 and $2.37. Along with Bitcoin and other alts, Sui also surged during the US election. A few hours ago, it created a new all time high at $4.04. However, it has been cold since then, moving very little. RSI in 4 hourly chart, is at 65.67 and is rising. Same goes for Average Directional Index. It has risen to 25.32. These two indicators hint at further upwards movement. Metrics Giving Warning However if we check the daily trading volume it says otherwise. It is down by 13.27% as compared to the last 24 hours. Despite this, the price has surged by 2.39%. At the time of writing Sui is trading at $3.84. ADX on a daily chart is at 22.11, reflecting the decreased power of buying. It shows that the direction of price has turned downwards. Another important thing to check here is the net flow of exchanges. Data from Coinglass shows that Sui is witnessing inflow to the exchanges. This generally happens when people bring their tokens to exchanges for selling. It increases the supply in the market affecting its price. Till the time of writing, $16.95 worth of inflow was recorded. What to Expect? Sui has been one of the best altcoin to provide massive returns to its investors this year. Following Bitcoin it has peaked however, it looks like the selling pressure is increasing. As People are taking their profits, the price might take a correction. The nearest support lies at $3.19 followed by a weak support at $2.9. If these two fail in case of a price drop, $2.3 support should be enough to hold the price.

Sandbox ( SAND ) rose over 40% to hit a 28-month high of $1.06 on Thursday, Dec. 5, bringing its market cap to over $2.27 billion at press time. The recent gains pushed the altcoin up 57% over the past week. The figures become even more striking when viewed over an extended timeframe: SAND has surged by 173.6% in the past two weeks and 303% over the last month. Notably, the rally coincided with a jump in the altcoin’s daily trading volume and open interest in the futures market. Daily trading volume for SAND stood up 95% over the past day, with over $4.1 billion worth of trades over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data revealed that open interest in the SAND futures market had jumped by 19.87% over the previous day, reaching $228.58 million, significantly higher than the $32.39 million recorded in early November. You might also like: The Sandbox buys PEPE, SHIB, BONK memecoins to support ‘their specific communities’ Why is SAND rising? The majority of the gains recorded in the past 24 hours came after the project announced two new Sandbox Improvement Proposals that are expected to add more engaging content to the platform. SIP 16 seeks €80,000 to develop Episode 2 of the popular survival horror game Deep Sea, introducing new features to elevate the gameplay experience. SIP 17 focuses on adding a player inventory filter within the Game Client, enabling users to quickly sort through equipment for a smoother gaming experience. The momentum also ties to the ongoing Alpha Season 4 , featuring the platform’s largest-ever reward pool of $2.5 million in SAND. Participants can earn rewards by completing various quests and challenges crafted in collaboration with major brands and franchises, including Playboy , Voice, and Hellboy . Whales are accumulating Whales have recently shifted their focus to the leading metaverse token. According to data from IntoTheBlock, SAND whale holder net flows shifted from a net outflow of $2.2 billion worth of SAND tokens at the beginning of this month to a net inflow of $8.2 billion worth of SAND tokens on Wednesday, Dec. 4. SAND whale net flow | Source: IntoTheBlock Whale accumulation often prompts retail investors to follow suit, driven by the fear of missing out (FOMO) on potential gains fueled by the growing interest in the altcoin. Despite the significant rise in whale investments, the percentage of total addresses in profit remains around 50%. This alleviates fears of immediate whale selloffs, as nearly half of the holders are still at a loss and may choose to wait for further gains in the altcoin before initiating a selling spree. Meanwhile, the surge isn’t just limited to SAND; it’s part of a bigger comeback for the entire metaverse crypto sector, which had previously experienced a significant downturn . Over the past 24 hours, the sector’s market cap jumped 5.29%, now sitting at over $30.68 billion. Trading activity also spiked, with volume soaring 64.5% during the same period.

The ride has been a wild one for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and the crypto markets, with the most recent catalyst stemming from President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly former regulator, to take the helm of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Here's what SA analysts have said in the lead-up to the latest milestone. Political support ""If Donald Trump's plan to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve is implemented and other countries quickly follow suit, it would significantly increase overall demand for Bitcoin. This could make Bitcoin worth $400,000 per coin within the next 5 years . Just like gold, Bitcoin is a decentralized and inflation-resistant asset that might retain value better than USD in some cases."" - Kennan Mell Wasn't DeFi the goal? ""We personally are of the opinion that Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general are most likely to be assigned to the 'greater fool theory.' One can question whether Bitcoin is actually 'decentralized,' as studies suggest that 75% of cryptocurrency volume is on exchanges, while at the same time there is a large concentration/centralization among miners and developers... We believe they are particularly problematic as they are highly volatile... Bitcoin is not widely used in everyday life.... Even as a 'safe haven' during a panic like 2020, Bitcoin plunged during the depths of the ongoing financial panic."" - Wright's Research Store of value ""The potential for widespread corporate [balance sheet] adoption is especially compelling given the current macroeconomics environment, where inflation concerns remain persistent, and fixed-income yields remain unattractive. MicroStrategy's ( NASDAQ: MSTR ) success is providing a tantalizing blueprint for other corporations to replicate its strategy in order to protect and even grow their treasury reserves in an era of monetary uncertainty."" - Simple Investment Ideas Last chance ""We are in the midst of one of those periodic eruptions of irrationality that brings forth all manner of con men, flimflam artists and fraudsters, determined to separate fools from their money as quickly as possible lest reality close the window of opportunity . In today's wild west of finance, even conservative investors can get taken."" - Joseph Calhoun Mainstream adoption ""This is a great entry point. The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is much more favorable with the current composition of the Presidency, Senate, and House, but there are other facts that make me even more confident. Bitcoin ETFs already exceed $104B in assets and are expected to surpass gold soon , which seems to suggest an influx of institutional investors."" - Multiplo Invest Ultimate speculative asset ""The unusual convergence of politics and cryptocurrencies that we have observed lately has created what can best be described as a perfect storm of sentiment-driven market dynamics . Bitcoin's meteoric rise is driven largely by sentiment rather than fundamentals, a fact acknowledged even by its staunchest proponents.

Here’s the Significance","SIRTRADESALOT, a crypto enthusiast on X, shared an intriguing development within the XRP ecosystem. Posting on X, he highlighted a transaction involving the creation of a trustline for 10,000 trillion RLUSD. The trustline was established by an account belonging to Ripple, prompting significant discussion among community members. The trustline creation occurred at 07:02 UTC, and transaction data confirms that it is associated with Ripple’s on-ledger account and sets a limit of 10,000 trillion RLUSD. 10,000 TRILLION RLUSD TRUSTLINE CREATED BY RIPPLE JUST NOW https://t.co/Le27ztWQ7I pic.twitter.com/FODtb9JT27 — SIRTRADESALOT (@COOLBREEZE_____) December 5, 2024 While trustlines allow accounts to hold and trade specific tokens on the XRP Ledger, the magnitude of this transaction suggests preparation for large-scale utility. The poster SIRTRADESALOT noted , “First time I’ve seen a trustline along the ODL route”. He also affirmed that it was created by Ripple. Is Ripple About to Launch RLUSD? The transaction is notable as Ripple is about to launch RLUSD. The company was supposed to launch the stablecoin some months ago but was delayed due to regulatory approval. Another post on X revealed that the stablecoin issuer has been busy today, issuing a significant amount of Trustlines over the past few hours. Stablecoins like RLUSD are instrumental in facilitating cross-border payments, a core area of Ripple’s focus. By integrating RLUSD into its ecosystem, Ripple aims to enhance transaction efficiency within ODL corridors. This aligns with Ripple’s broader strategy to provide liquidity solutions for global remittances, especially in regions where traditional financial systems face limitations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The community is also excited about how the stablecoin launch can help XRP, as some experts believe it could send XRP as high as $10,000. Although the community is excited about the stablecoin launch, the company has yet to release a statement on this and has not officially launched the stablecoin. Vet, a validator on the XRP Ledger, also weighed in on this issue, explaining that trustlines can be created by anyone and do not mean that tokens have been issued. According to Vet, they are just trustlines with limits that allow accounts to accept certain assets. The company affirmed earlier today that it is working with the NYDFS for final approval, and hopes to launch under proper regulatory supervision. The launch of the stablecoin will be a significant milestone for Ripple, XRP, and the broader ecosystem, and the company is doing its best to ensure everything is done right.

37249172,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316617,1733395581,FOMO and FUD Still Drive Majority of Crypto Investment Decisions: Kraken Survey,"A recent survey conducted by Kraken shows the significant role that emotional triggers like fear of missing out (FOMO) and fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) play in shaping the current market cycle. The survey , which analyzed the responses of 1,248 crypto holders, reveals that over 80% of participants admitted to making investment choices influenced by these emotional factors. Kraken’s findings indicate that while FOMO drives 84% of crypto holders to chase surging prices, 81% have been swayed by FUD, causing hesitancy or panic selling. Moreover, 63% of respondents acknowledged that emotional decision-making has negatively impacted their portfolios. The Influence of FOMO and FUD on Investor Behavior FOMO appears to have a stronger grip on crypto holders compared to FUD, with 60% of respondents admitting their primary fear is missing out on price surges that could lead to profits. Source: Kraken Comparatively, only 17% expressed concern about missing price dips, where lower entry points offer potential bargains. This prioritization of short-term gains over strategic accumulation may explain why many investors buy during market highs rather than adopting disciplined approaches like dollar-cost averaging during price drops. Interestingly, the survey also highlights the disproportionate influence of social media and fast-paced platforms in exacerbating FOMO. About 61% of participants rely on sources such as social media influencers, news outlets, and crypto analytics platforms for market insights. Of these, 85% admitted that emotional decisions tied to FOMO significantly hurt their portfolios. The ease of accessing information, often incomplete or sensationalized on these platforms, contributes to the impulsive trading behaviors prevalent among crypto holders. On the other hand, FUD leads to hesitation and panic among investors, driven by uncertainties about a cryptocurrency’s future or market downturns. Kraken notes that these emotional responses are particularly damaging because they often result in poorly timed exits or missed recovery opportunities. Optimism Persists Despite Emotional Pitfalls Despite the widespread acknowledgment of FOMO and FUD as detrimental factors, the survey reveals a surprising optimism among crypto holders about the market’s future. A significant 68% of respondents believe substantial gains are still to come, even as 64% feel they’ve missed out on the most lucrative opportunities. Source: Kraken Demographics play a notable role in these sentiments. Among participants aged 45–60, 78% strongly felt they had missed out on early crypto profits, yet 74% remain confident about future growth. Similarly, while 67% of those aged 60 and above expressed regret about missed gains, 73% believe the market still holds promising potential. Younger investors remain optimistic, though slightly less regretful, with 36% of 18–29-year-olds and 49% of 30–44-year-olds expecting significant future profits. The survey also highlights gender differences in emotional investing. Male respondents were more likely than females to make decisions driven by FOMO (66% versus 42%) and were more prone to regret their choices, with 70% of men feeling they missed major gains compared to 48% of women. This could suggest that male investors, while more impulsive in their strategies, experience greater emotional consequences when expectations fall short. Earlier this year, a new study published in the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction highlights the risks of financial and emotional harm faced by crypto investors, particularly those with gambling tendencies or FOMO. Based on a survey of 487 crypto investors, the study found that impulsive traits, rather than the amount of time or money invested, were the primary indicators of harmful behavior.

Meme coins are poised for a major breakout event as part of a broader market recovery. PEPE is showing signs of breaking out from a long-standing resistance zone on the 4-hour chart.The underlying potential and price patterns suggest a massive surge of nearly 40%. Let’s take a closer look at PEPE’s price analysis.PEPE Price AnalysisOn the 4-hour chart, PEPE’s price action is currently in a sideways trend, forming a consolidation range. This consolidation began after the bullish attempt to close above $0.00002363 failed.The failure to sustain the bullish momentum followed a nearly 200% price surge from November 5 to November 14. During this period, the price rose from $0.00000803 to a peak of $0.00002567. As a result, PEPE’s price action is now forming a bullish flag pattern. PEPE Price Chart The consolidation range is bound by two important price action levels. The support zone is strong at $0.000001775, while the resistance zone is near $0.0000023.The upper ceiling and lower boundary coincide with the 38.20% Fibonacci and base levels, respectively. Additionally, the shifting dynamics within this consolidation range suggest the formation of an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern.Supporting the bullish trend, the MACD and signal lines have recently crossed positively, reinforcing the uptrend with an increase in positive histograms. The 4-hour RSI has surpassed the 50-level and remains above the 14-day SMA. Furthermore, the lack of divergence strengthens the chances of a breakout as the price approaches the overbought zone.PEPE Price Targets $0.000030The neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern aligns with the 38.20% Fibonacci level. PEPE’s price action is currently showing a bullish reversal, completing the right shoulder of the pattern.Additionally, the PEPE market price stands at $0.000002158, surpassing the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $0.000002143. If the uptrend breaks above the overhead resistance, PEPE will likely emerge as one of the top gainers, leading to a high-momentum rally.The Fibonacci levels suggest potential price targets at the 61.80% and 78.60% levels, priced at $0.000002740 and $0.0000030, respectively.

This is more than five times faster than any other ETF before it. In fact, BlackRock’s other big fund, the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF, took over 1,300 days to reach the same amount. Bitcoin’s Big Breakthrough and IBIT’s Rocket Growth Bitcoin has gone above 140% this year—especially from big institutional investors. The launch of IBIT has made it easier for these investors to tap into Bitcoin’s potential without dealing with the complexities of buying, holding, or trading the cryptocurrency directly. IBIT has quickly become a favorite among big-money investors looking for a piece of the Bitcoin action. Ki Young Ju, Founder of CryptoQuant points out that fresh capital is driving Bitcoin’s price rise and ETF prospects. As the realized cap grows, Bitcoin’s ceiling price has increased from $129K to $146K in just 30 days. At $102K, Bitcoin is still far from a bubble, needing a 43% surge to reach the level typically considered overvalued. Bitcoin ETFs: A Bridge for Traditional Investors Spot Bitcoin ETFs, like BlackRock’s IBIT, offer investors a simple way to get exposure to Bitcoin’s price movement. These ETFs were approved by the U.S. SEC earlier this year, ending years of regulatory pushback. Now, instead of worrying about how to store and secure Bitcoin, investors can just buy shares of an ETF that tracks Bitcoin’s value. This has opened the doors for billions of dollars to flood into Bitcoin from the world of traditional finance. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, recently pointed out the impressive success of BlackRock’s IBIT, saying it has already surpassed the iShares Gold ETF (IAU), which launched in 2005. He mentioned that if IBIT were BlackRock’s only ETF, it would already be among the top 15 ETF issuers in the world. Despite some critics doubting the demand for a Bitcoin ETF, the rapid growth of IBIT has proven them wrong, exceeding expectations. Moreover, Bitcoin, a digital currency that’s only been around for a little over a decade, is now more popular in BlackRock’s investment portfolio than gold, a traditional store of value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What’s Next for Bitcoin After $100K?

According to Drake, Solana's current competitive advantages in speed and throughput are not sustainable in the long term and will not pose a significant threat to Ethereum's dominance in the blockchain ecosystem. Speaking about Solana’s strong development momentum, Drake acknowledged its successes but suggested that Ethereum’s long-term strategy will prevail. “Solana is at its peak right now, but I think this will be the end of Solana’s golden age,” Drake said. “The fundamental differences in its architecture make it unscalable, which means that its competitive advantages in latency and throughput will eventually disappear.” Related News: Why Has the XRP Rally Lost Its Momentum? What Can Happen Next? Here are Predictions Drake noted that Ethereum relies on Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimistic and ZK-rollups to address transaction speed and cost challenges while maintaining security and decentralization at the base layer. He positioned Ethereum Layer 2 solutions as a true competitor to Solana. “I think Layer 1 is competing with Bitcoin and Layer 2 is competing with Solana,” Drake explained, adding, “Competing with Solana is not even within the scope of Layer 1’s responsibilities. We should be focusing on security and the overall health of the network. If Solana faces competition, that competition will come from applications and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions.” *This is not investment advice.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-donald-vs-israel-donisra-to-skyrocket-16000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-doge-and-shib-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Bitcoin’s price moved past the $100,000 mark in the early hours of Thursday, an event that put El Salvador President Nayib Bukele in a “delightful” mood. According to blockchain data tracker firm Arkham Intelligence, El Salvador is holding Bitcoin (BTC) worth over $610.5 million. The country, which became the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, has seen its cryptocurrency portfolio surge in value as BTC broke through the $100,000 barrier on December 5. Bitcoin’s rally to six figures comes after a year of sustained growth and favorable macroeconomic factors, coupled with Donald Trump’s recent US presidential elections victory. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading a little over $101,000, representing a year-to-date gain of over 117%. Bitcoin’s impact on El Salvador’s portfolio El Salvador’s government, which has been buying Bitcoin currently holds 5,995 BTC acquired at an average price of $45,297 per coin. As per BTC’s current valuation, the country’s holdings are worth over $613 million, up substantially by 126.18% from their initial investment of $269.7 million. Source: X President Bukele took to social media platform X to celebrate this achievement, posting a portfolio chart that showed unrealized profits of over $333.5 million. Tech mogul Elon Musk replied to the post, calling El Salvador’s government Bitcoin investment “impressive.” Bukele responded with a photo captioned, “it ain’t much, but its honest work.” El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment began in September 2021. At the time, President Bukele faced significant skepticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by announcing BTC as a legal tender. On November 17, 2022, Bukele proceeded to reveal the country’s plan to purchase one Bitcoin daily through a social media post . Source: X Earlier this year, the IMF urged El Salvador to enhance transparency in its Bitcoin adoption strategy. It emphasized the importance of implementing additional measures to address potential risks tied to their monetary policy, believing BTC would cause dire long-term economic implications because of its price volatility nature. The government initially was highly criticized by financial watchdogs for investing public funds into a volatile asset. However, Bukele remained steadfast on his bullish bitcoin sentiments, arguing that Bitcoin would promote financial inclusion, attract tourism, and reduce remittance costs. Over the years, El Salvador introduced several initiatives to bolster its adoption of Bitcoin. These include the development of “Bitcoin City,” a tax-free zone powered by geothermal energy from the country’s volcanoes, and the issuance of “ Volcano Bonds ” to fund infrastructure projects. Despite challenges, including fluctuating Bitcoin prices and public protests, Bukele’s administration has maintained its commitment to Bitcoin. Bhutan’s parallel Bitcoin strategy El Salvador’s Bitcoin success story has inspired other nations, including Bhutan, which recently disclosed its Bitcoin mining operations leveraging hydropower. Like El Salvador, Bhutan aims to use Bitcoin to diversify its economy and enhance its financial independence. Arkham monitoring reveals that the Bhutan government was in possession of 12.211K BTC, valued at a total of $1.25B, at press time. In September, Bhutan’s Bitcoin holdings surpassed 13,000 BTC, valued at approximately $750 million at the time. A month later, the government sold Bitcoins worth $33.5 million via cryptocurrency exchange Binance . Bhutan ranks fifth globally in BTC holdings, trailing only the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine. While the country’s current BTC holdings are significantly smaller than the reserves held by the United States, China, and the United Kingdom, Bhutan’s holdings exceed those of El Salvador.

37248541,https://coinpaper.com/6390/bit-go-plans-expansion-into-india-s-booming-crypto-market,1733394644,BitGo Plans Expansion into India’s Booming Crypto Market,"The Indian government is stepping up its regulatory oversight of the cryptocurrency industry, uncovering significant tax evasion cases involving major exchanges and engaging in discussions with global platforms seeking entry into its burgeoning market. Recent investigations revealed over ₹824 crore ($97 million) in unpaid GST by exchanges like Binance and WazirX, while platforms such as BitGo are actively exploring opportunities to expand into India’s multibillion-dollar crypto sector despite stringent compliance requirements. BitGo Eyes Entry into India's Booming Crypto Market Amid Regulatory Scrutiny Chen Fang, Chief Operating Officer at BitGo, shared the company’s intentions during the India Blockchain Week, emphasizing the platform’s interest in navigating India’s complex regulatory environment. ”We’re currently not in the Indian market,” said Fang. “And we’re, obviously, interested in this market, hence why we are here. There are active conversations between us and the FIU to talk about entering this space.” This announcement comes as India ranks at the top of Chainalysis’ crypto adoption index for 2024, showcasing significant grassroots enthusiasm despite restrictive measures on offshore crypto exchanges. India has adopted a stringent stance on cryptocurrency operations, particularly targeting foreign platforms. In December 2023, the FIU classified nine foreign crypto exchanges as non-compliant with the country’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. The blacklist included major players such as Binance, Kraken, Gate.io, and Bitstamp. Alongside the classification came bans on their websites and mobile apps, effectively cutting off Indian access to these platforms. Binance, however, managed to reintegrate into the Indian market after adhering to regulatory requirements, albeit with an $86 million tax penalty. This development underlines the hurdles for global firms seeking entry into one of the world’s fastest-growing crypto economies. For BitGo, the challenge lies in navigating these strict compliance requirements. The platform, which recently launched a global service targeting retail clients, must secure full registration under India’s local laws to operate in the region. Headquartered in California, BitGo boasts a global workforce of 460 employees, with 150 based in its Bangalore office, positioning the company well for a foray into the Indian market. The platform provides a suite of services, including trading and physical custody solutions for institutional clients, across more than 50 countries. BitGo’s physical storage infrastructure is spread across seven jurisdictions, including the United States, Germany, South Korea, and Singapore. In recent months, the company has obtained licenses in key markets, including a crypto exchange license in Singapore. Offering its services in India would add another strategic pillar to its global operations. Centralization Concerns: BitGo COO’s Critique of Blockchain In addition to discussing market entry, Fang weighed in on a broader issue plaguing the blockchain industry: centralization. Reflecting on the vision of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, Fang expressed skepticism about the current state of decentralization across many blockchains. “I think Satoshi would be kind of disappointed looking at the decentralization element specifically,” he remarked. “If you look carefully at some of the blockchains that are getting a lot of traction, some of these blockchains [are] actually not decentralized.” Fang pointed to the concept of sequencers—entities responsible for ordering and processing blockchain transactions—as an area of concern. According to him, when sequencers are controlled by a single entity, the network can no longer be considered decentralized. “Who controls that sequencer? Oh, the company behind the blockchain controls that sequencer. Is that really a decentralized blockchain? No, it’s not. It’s a public append-only database that has one admin user,” he asserted. BitGo’s potential entry into India could bring a trusted institutional player into a market often fraught with regulatory uncertainty and compliance challenges. However, the company will need to tread carefully, ensuring full adherence to India’s AML and tax laws while building trust with local regulators. Fang’s remarks on decentralization add another layer to the conversation about the future of blockchain in India, a country poised to play a significant role in shaping the global crypto narrative. As the industry grows, balancing decentralization ideals with regulatory demands will remain a critical challenge for blockchain firms. Indian Government Uncovers $97 Million in Unpaid GST from Crypto Exchanges, Intensifies Crackdown Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary revealed the figures during a parliamentary session on Dec. 3, citing investigations into several prominent crypto platforms such as WazirX , CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber. Of the ₹824 crore ($97 million) in unpaid taxes identified, the Indian government has so far recovered ₹122.3 crore ($14 million) in taxes, penalties, and interest. Chaudhary emphasized that the recovery is part of an ongoing effort to ensure compliance with India’s taxation and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. The investigations revealed the following unpaid GST amounts from major crypto platforms: WazirX: ₹40.5 crore ($4.8 million) CoinDCX: ₹16.84 crore ($1.9 million) CoinSwitch Kuber: ₹14.13 crore ($1.7 million) WazirX, for instance, has not only paid the unpaid GST but also settled penalties and interest, bringing its total payment to ₹49.18 crore ($5.8 million), a 20% increase over the initial amount owed. However, some entities, including Binance and Hyperux Technologies, have yet to settle their dues. Binance, which was accused of evading ₹722 crore ($85 million) in taxes earlier this year, has not been included in the recovered amount, suggesting its compliance case remains unresolved. The GST evasion allegations shed some light on the broader regulatory uncertainty facing crypto businesses in India. A spokesperson for WazirX attributed the tax discrepancies to a lack of clarity in the country's GST laws regarding cryptocurrencies. According to a spokesperson from WazirX, the tax evasion case occurred when the “GST law on cryptocurrencies was not clear in India.” Binance, in contrast, issued a statement affirming its cooperation with Indian authorities. “We continue to work closely with regulatory authorities and attend necessary hearings to address any concerns and questions. Binance remains responsive and cooperative and is committed to addressing all necessary tax inquiries,” a Binance representative said. A Broader Crackdown on Crypto Firms The government’s investigations go beyond tax compliance. As part of its effort to bring crypto-related activities under its legal framework, India has registered 47 virtual digital asset service providers as reporting entities under the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). This move aims to align the industry with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations and enhance oversight of crypto transactions. In December 2023, the FIU classified several foreign exchanges as non-compliant with AML laws, banning their operations within the country. The enforcement targeted prominent platforms like Binance, Kraken, and Gate.io. Although some, like Binance, have re-entered the market by adhering to compliance measures, the industry continues to grapple with the implications of stringent regulatory scrutiny. The Indian government’s crackdown on GST evasion signals a broader intent to bring the cryptocurrency sector under a robust regulatory framework. This enforcement drive may lead to greater transparency and compliance but could also present operational hurdles for crypto businesses navigating India's complex tax landscape. Despite the challenges, India remains a major market for cryptocurrency adoption. According to Chainalysis, the country ranked first in crypto adoption globally in 2024. However, high taxation and stringent regulations have prompted concerns among stakeholders about stifling innovation and growth. The ongoing investigations and tax recoveries signal a shift in how Indian authorities approach crypto regulation, focusing on accountability and adherence to existing financial laws. While compliance efforts by platforms like WazirX demonstrate the industry’s willingness to cooperate, unresolved cases like Binance’s underline the challenges of operating in India’s evolving regulatory environment. As the government continues to enforce its tax policies and strengthen its regulatory framework, the long-term implications for the Indian cryptocurrency market remain uncertain. Whether these measures will foster a more transparent and resilient ecosystem or drive innovation to more favorable jurisdictions is a question the industry will closely watch.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6390/bit-go-plans-expansion-into-india-s-booming-crypto-market,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

XRP, which had recently hit a seven-year high of $2.90, has since plunged 25%, now trading at $2.30. Similarly, other altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB) and Tron (TRX) saw their momentum fade as Bitcoin regained the spotlight. Industry players have celebrated Bitcoin’s milestone, dubbing December 5 as “$100K Day.” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong mentioned Bitcoin’s extraordinary growth since the platform’s launch in 2012, stating, “If you bought $100 of Bitcoin then, it would now be worth $1.5 million.” “Bitcoin is the best-performing asset of the last 12 years, and it’s still early days.” If you bought $100 of Bitcoin when Coinbase was founded in June 2012, it would now be worth about $1,500,000. If you kept the $100 USD you'd only be able to purchase about $73 worth of goods today.

CoinGlass reported $132 million in short positions wiped out within four hours as traders scrambled to adjust to Bitcoin’s unexpected leap. What is Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s historic surge past the $100,000 milestone has captivated the cryptocurrency market, but Sergei Gorev, Head of Risk at YouHodler, remains cautious. In a recent statement shared with Cryptonews.com, Gorev predicted that the price may see only moderate growth beyond this level before a significant correction takes hold. “The cryptocurrency market is very fond of round numbers, and the price often unfolds in such cases.” “Also note that monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual futures and options contracts are expected to expire in two weeks,” he added. Gorev emphasized that Bitcoin’s price dynamics are influenced by key market cycles, including the expiration of futures and options contracts. With monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual contracts set to expire in two weeks, traders should brace for heightened volatility. Adding to this cautious outlook, Gorev highlighted Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 index, which is approaching what he describes as the “overheating phase.” As the broader financial market shows signs of strain, the likelihood of Bitcoin experiencing a significant price correction increases. Divergences in price charts and a rising USD exchange rate further support this view, indicating that the current rally may be running out of momentum. “The price increase may still continue, but not significantly,” he concluded. “Many technical indicators have already lined up in the direction of price correction, and many algo traders will start looking for an entry point to open short positions in order to defuse divergences on the charts.” The post Bitcoin Dominance Surges 4.4% to 57% as BTC Hits Record $104,000, Challenging Altcoin Season Narrative appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-dominance-surges-4-4-to-57-as-asset-hits-record-104000-challenging-alt-season-narrative/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37249171.jpeg

37248589,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24522,1733394179,What Can we Learn From Bitcoin’s Journey to $100K?,"Bitcoin’s journey from an obscure computer science experiment to a globally recognised digital asset has been marked by groundbreaking innovation and significant milestones. Bitcoin was designed as a decentralised, trustless, peer-to-peer digital currency that operates independently of traditional financial institutions. Launched in 2009, its blockchain introduced a public, immutable ledger secured through a Proof of Work mechanism, solving the “double-spending problem” and establishing digital scarcity with a fixed supply of 21 million coins. This breakthrough enabled a robust, censorship-resistant P2P digital cash system immune to central control or inflation. From Obscure Computer Science Experiment to Digital Gold Bitcoin began its journey in 2008, emerging from the release of a whitepaper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System by an anonymous figure or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper outlined a groundbreaking concept for a decentralised, trustless, P2P digital currency that did not rely on traditional financial institutions or third-party intermediaries. In January 2009, Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network with the mining of its first block, known as the “genesis block,” embedding a cryptic message referencing the financial instability of the time. This marked the inception of Bitcoin as both a currency and a novel form of digital technology, underpinned by blockchain, a public, immutable ledger designed to ensure transparency and security. Bitcoin introduced the technical breakthrough of creating digital scarcity. Unlike previous attempts at digital currencies, Bitcoin employed a decentralised consensus mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW), which required participants to solve computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network. This innovation solved the “double-spending problem,” ensuring that digital assets could not be copied or counterfeited. By limiting Bitcoin’s total supply to 21 million coins and distributing control across a global network of nodes, it established a form of currency immune to centralised manipulation, monetary inflation, or censorship, a system robust enough to function independently of any single entity. GET STARTED WITH BITCOIN NOW Over the next decade, Bitcoin evolved from an obscure experiment among computer scientists and cryptography enthusiasts into a widely recognised digital asset. Early milestones included its first real-world transaction in 2010 when 10,000 bitcoins were famously exchanged for two pizzas, and the subsequent development of the first cryptocurrency exchanges like Mt. Gox , which enabled broader participation. The early development of industrial Bitcoin mining began as enthusiasts transitioned from hobbyist setups using CPUs and GPUs to specialised ASIC machines, enabling large-scale operations that significantly increased network hash power and mining efficiency. WikiLeaks ’ adoption of Bitcoin in 2011, after traditional payment systems cut off support, brought Bitcoin into the mainstream by demonstrating its potential as a censorship-resistant financial tool, garnering global attention and legitimising its use case as a decentralised currency. Bitcoin’s decentralised nature and resistance to control made it a haven for individuals in economically unstable regions, a tool for financial inclusion, and, for many, a hedge against traditional financial systems. Its ability to operate without central authority or downtime earned it the reputation of being a “trustless” and resilient currency. Bitcoin’s influence extends far beyond its initial purpose as a peer-to-peer digital currency. It has spawned an entire asset class of digital assets which all trace their inspiration back to Bitcoin, spawning thousands of cryptocurrencies and decentralised financial applications. This new ecosystem has driven innovation in areas like programmable money, Decentralised Finance (DeFi), and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Despite criticism over its energy consumption, regulatory scrutiny, and price volatility, Bitcoin’s foundational principles, digital scarcity, decentralisation, and programmability, have redefined how value is stored and transferred in the digital age. It remains a testament to the power of cryptography and decentralised technology to withstand both human and systemic challenges, offering a resilient alternative to traditional monetary systems. Join the discussion about Bitcoin in our Discord! The Fundamentals Backing Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise to $100k Bitcoin’s rise to an all-time high of $100,000 USD is underpinned by its unique market fundamentals and inherent qualities that distinguish it from traditional assets. One of its most defining attributes is its fixed supply of 21 million coins, which creates digital scarcity and positions Bitcoin as a universal hedge against inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin’s issuance is algorithmically controlled and gradually decreases over time through its halving mechanism . This predictable monetary policy contrasts sharply with the relative unpredictability of central banks, attracting investors seeking a store of value resilient to monetary debasement. The key driver is Bitcoin’s decentralisation and censorship resistance characteristics, which reinforces its appeal as a trustless, borderless currency. Operated by a distributed network of mining nodes rather than a central authority, Bitcoin ensures transparency and security through its immutable ledger. This decentralised nature makes it immune to government intervention or centralised failure, offering a unique value proposition as a global financial asset which exists outside the global financial system. Additionally, its permissionless design allows anyone with an internet connection to participate, making Bitcoin a tool for financial inclusion and access, particularly in regions with unstable currencies or restrictive financial systems. Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption has also played a significant role in driving its value to unprecedented heights. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 has significantly driven institutional demand in this market cycle by providing a regulated and accessible vehicle for large-scale investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding or managing the cryptocurrency. Major financial institutions, corporations, and investment funds have increasingly recognised Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, incorporating it into their portfolios as digital gold. Publicly traded companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, as well as traditional banks offering Bitcoin custodial services and exchange-traded products, have bolstered its legitimacy in mainstream finance. This institutional interest has not only increased demand but also reduced perceived risk for retail investors, further driving adoption and price appreciation. Bitcoin’s network effects and maturing ecosystem have reinforced its market dominance. As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin enjoys a strong brand identity and robust infrastructure, including widespread acceptance, established exchanges, and advanced custody solutions. The growing integration of Bitcoin into DeFi and popular payment systems, coupled with developments like the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, have expanded its use cases beyond a speculative asset. These factors, combined with its role as a digital store of value and medium of exchange, have propelled Bitcoin to unprecedented heights, reflecting both its market fundamentals and the global shift toward digital assets. The Path Forward From Here The introduction of Ordinals and Runes catalysed a surge of development within Bitcoin’s Layer 2 ecosystem , unlocking new functionalities and sparking a wave of innovation. Ordinals, which enabled the inscription of digital artefacts onto satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), brought NFT-like capabilities to the Bitcoin network. This expanded Bitcoin’s use case beyond its traditional role as a store of value and medium of exchange, creating a market for digital collectables secured by Bitcoin’s unparalleled decentralisation and security. Runes, meanwhile, added another layer of programmability, enabling the creation of more complex tokenised assets and applications on Bitcoin. Together, these technologies have sparked a flurry of development for a growing ecosystem of Layer 2 solutions, ranging from scaling technologies to specialised financial applications, extending Bitcoin’s utility far beyond its original design. This explosion of development has also brought smart contracts and DeFi use cases, more commonly seen on Web3 protocols, to Bitcoin, areas previously dominated by other platforms like Ethereum or Solana. Bitcoin’s variety of new Layer 2 protocols have evolved to incorporate programmable features, allowing developers to build lending, borrowing, and trading platforms directly tied to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Emerging Layer 2 protocols are leveraging Bitcoin’s liquidity and security to create DeFi ecosystems that align with Bitcoin’s qualities of decentralisation and censorship resistance. These developments have made Bitcoin not just a competitor in the DeFi space but also a platform uniquely suited for trustless, programmable financial instruments. Covenants are poised to significantly enhance smart contracts and Layer 2 solutions on Bitcoin by enabling more advanced control over how Bitcoins can be spent. Unlike traditional Bitcoin transactions, which allow unrestricted spending of outputs, covenants introduce the ability to define specific conditions under which outputs can be spent, adding a new layer of programmability. This improvement can bolster the functionality of Layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network or Ark , by enabling more efficient channel management and trustless escrow mechanisms. Additionally, covenants open the door to sophisticated smart contract capabilities, including programmable security measures, DeFi protocols, and asset tokenisation directly on Bitcoin. By extending Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities while maintaining its foundational security and decentralisation, covenants represent a critical step forward in making Bitcoin a critical platform for complex financial applications. Simultaneously, the legitimisation of Bitcoin as an asset, and digital assets as an asset class has been the primary driver of a “bitcoinification” of traditional finance, as financial institutions increasingly seek to integrate Bitcoin’s properties with existing systems. Bitcoin’s recognised status as digital gold has encouraged traditional finance players to explore its potential for tokenising real-world assets, such as real estate, equities, and bonds, on decentralised platforms, like the Liquid Network . These tokenised assets, secured on Bitcoin-based Layer 2 solutions, promise greater liquidity, transparency, and efficiency compared to conventional systems. By blending Bitcoin’s trustless architecture with traditional financial instruments, these efforts aim to revolutionise how securitised products and real-world assets are traded and managed. The convergence of fintech and Bitcoin’s decentralised principles is also driving innovation in areas such as payment systems and cross-border transactions. As financial institutions adopt Bitcoin-backed technologies, they are exploring ways to harness its programmability and scalability for enhanced financial services. This includes creating Bitcoin-based ETFs, integrating Bitcoin with payment apps, and leveraging Layer 2 solutions to support high-speed, low-cost transactions, and asset tokenisation. These developments not only enhance Bitcoin’s value proposition but also solidify its role as the foundation of a broader digital asset economy, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralised systems in a way that could transform global financial markets.

Is it market dominance, revolutionary tech, or explosive growth potential? Bitcoin, the undisputed king of crypto, continues to command headlines as its market cap soars past $38 billion. Meanwhile, Hedera is disrupting industries with its energy-efficient network and partnerships, even amid Binance’s $85M tax probe. But as exciting as these giants are, Qubetics is carving out its path to becoming a game-changer. With over $4.3 million raised in its presale and innovative solutions to real-world problems, it’s drawing attention as the Best Altcoin to Buy in December 2024. Let’s dive deeper into why Qubetics could be your next big investment. Qubetics: Revolutionising Finance with Its Non-Custodial Wallet In a world where financial freedom is under threat, Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet emerges as a beacon of hope. Unlike traditional wallets controlled by third-party custodians, this wallet gives users full control over their digital assets. But why does this matter? The lack of non-custodial wallets has exposed users to significant risks. Security breaches are rampant, with centralised platforms often targeted by hackers. Regulatory crackdowns add another layer of uncertainty, as governments tighten their grip on financial operations. Dependency on third parties means limited access to funds during emergencies, while privacy concerns plague every transaction. Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet directly addresses these issues, offering users unparalleled control, privacy, and peace of mind. Analysts predict that this innovation could drive the $TICS token to $10-$15 post-mainnet launch. It’s no wonder investors are calling Qubetics one of the Best Altcoins to Buy in December 2024. For more information, watch this video ! Qubetics Presale: A Record-Breaking Success As of December 4, 2024, Qubetics is in the 11th stage of its presale. Priced at just $0.0282 per token, it’s a golden opportunity for early investors. The presale has already raised over $4.3 million, with more than 266 million $TICS tokens sold to over 6,200 holders. The buzz isn’t just about numbers. Analysts predict jaw-dropping returns, with $TICS potentially hitting $0.25 by the presale’s end. That’s a 783% ROI for those who act now. The numbers only get more exciting post-presale, with projections of $1, $5, and even $15 per token after the mainnet launch. Imagine turning a $1,000 investment into over $52,000. If you’re looking for the next big thing in crypto, Qubetics might just be it. Its presale success solidifies its reputation as one of the Best Altcoins to Buy in December 2024. Bitcoin: The Giant That Refuses to Slow Down Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, continues to dominate the market with a staggering $38 billion market cap. Despite facing bear markets and regulatory challenges, it remains a staple in portfolios worldwide. MicroStrategy, one of Bitcoin’s biggest advocates, exemplifies why the asset is still a favourite. The company’s ability to withstand Bitcoin’s volatile price movements showcases the digital asset’s long-term potential. But Bitcoin isn’t just about price stability. Its role as a hedge against inflation and a store of value makes it an essential asset in today’s uncertain economic climate. However, with its high price point and slower technological evolution compared to newer cryptos, is Bitcoin still the best choice for new investors? While Bitcoin remains a titan, it’s clear that projects like Qubetics, with their innovation and accessibility, are attracting fresh attention. As investors weigh their options, it’s crucial to consider whether Bitcoin’s dominance is enough to maintain its appeal against emerging competitors. Hedera: Pioneering the Future of Decentralised Tech Hedera Hashgraph is making waves with its focus on energy efficiency and enterprise adoption. Unlike traditional blockchain networks, Hedera uses a unique consensus algorithm that promises faster transactions and lower energy consumption. This has made it a go-to platform for companies looking to integrate decentralised solutions without compromising sustainability. Recent partnerships have propelled Hedera into the spotlight, with the platform playing a key role in industries like supply chain management and digital identity. Its ability to handle high transaction volumes with minimal environmental impact sets it apart in a crowded market. However, while Hedera excels in enterprise solutions, it doesn’t offer the same groundbreaking ROI potential as Qubetics. For investors looking to maximise their returns, Qubetics’ presale offers a compelling alternative to consider alongside Hedera’s steady growth. Conclusion: Time to Make Your Move The crypto world is full of opportunities, but not all coins are created equal. Bitcoin remains a trusted giant, and Hedera is leading the charge in sustainable tech. However, Qubetics is capturing the imagination of investors worldwide with its innovative solutions and staggering ROI potential. Don’t miss out. With its presale in full swing, Qubetics is your chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next big thing in crypto. Visit the Qubetics website today and secure your $TICS tokens before the price jumps.

37248138,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311593,1733393701,Analyst Benjamin Cowen Says One Catalyst Could Trigger ‘One More Push Higher’ for Bitcoin Before End of 2024,"Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen is leaning bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the flagship digital asset hovers above $100,000. Cowen tells his 836,000 YouTube subscribers that if Bitcoin follows the cyclical view of booms and busts that come after the halving event every four years, BTC “could get one more push higher before the end of the year.” According to the widely followed analyst, a lower or an unchanged US unemployment rate could be bullish for Bitcoin. “So in order for Bitcoin to continue to push higher though into the end of the year and continue to follow the cyclical view then arguably the labor market data needs to come in relatively okay this month. So I would say if the unemployment rate were to come in at 4% or 4.1% then it would likely favor Bitcoin to continue to go up into the end of the year.” The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced an unemployment rate of 4.1% in November, the same figure they had reported in the previous month. The widely followed analyst says that for several months, Bitcoin has displayed an inverse relationship with the US unemployment rate. “Bitcoin needs a reason to go down, not a reason to go up. Bitcoin just naturally goes up because people dollar-cost-average Bitcoin. So it tends to go up for no reason at all. If it’s going to go down, it needs a reason. Essentially, from March until August, the unemployment rate gave Bitcoin a reason to go down because the unemployment rate was accelerating higher. But ever since August, the unemployment rate was dropping or going sideways and you can see that’s where the low occurred for Bitcoin – it was in August of 2024 that [the] low occurred. And it happened to correspond to when the unemployment rate stopped going up and then we got a lower print.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $96,607 at time of writing.

Experts Reveal Targets for 2024 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has finally done it—it’s crossed the $100K mark , a milestone that many thought was years away. The crypto world is buzzing with excitement, but as the celebrations continue, one big question looms: What happens next for Bitcoin? With so much riding on this achievement, the next steps could be game-changing. Let’s dive into what’s been driving this growth and where Bitcoin might be headed in the months ahead. Q4 of 2024: A Strong Quarter for Bitcoin The fourth quarter of 2024 has been a fantastic period for Bitcoin. Since November 5, the BTC market has surged by at least 51.12%. Several factors have contributed to this growth, including the shifting political landscape, especially in the U.S. , where regulations are becoming more favorable for cryptocurrencies. Additionally, institutional interest in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP is rising. Just yesterday, Bitcoin rose by 2.91%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin stands at $102,676, a solid 2.67% above the $100K mark. What’s Next? Looking Ahead to the Halving Cycle With the current upward trend, investors are eager to know how far Bitcoin can go during this halving cycle. A useful way to estimate this is by looking at the returns from previous cycles. In the 2013 cycle, Bitcoin saw an incredible 7900% return. In 2017, it dropped to 2560%, and in the last cycle, it was just 594%. This pattern suggests that Bitcoin’s returns are decreasing over time, so a return higher than 200% in this cycle seems unlikely. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Attention Traders: Do Not Miss the 30% Rise of This Dwindling Altcoin in December 2024 , Future Projections for Bitcoin Based on past cycles, most experts believe Bitcoin will grow between 100% and 200% during this halving cycle.

Speaking at the New York Times-hosted DealBook Summit on December 4, Powell remarked, “Bitcoin is just like gold—it’s virtual, it’s digital. It’s not being used as a form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile.” Powell’s comments echo statements he made in 2021, when Bitcoin traded at $58,200. Since then, Bitcoin has surged 70%, significantly outpacing gold’s 52% rise over the same period. Despite this, Powell dismissed notions that Bitcoin reflects diminishing faith in the Federal Reserve or the U.S. dollar, asserting, “I don’t think that’s how people think about it.” While Powell clarified that he does not own Bitcoin—citing Federal Reserve restrictions—he maintained a pragmatic stance on cryptocurrency firms partnering with banks. His primary concerns centered on safeguarding consumer protection and ensuring that such collaborations do not compromise the financial health of institutions. Bitcoin Surpasses $100,000 as Pro-Crypto Sentiment Grows Powell’s remarks come against the backdrop of a Bitcoin rally that saw the cryptocurrency cross $100,000 level on December 5 . Market enthusiasm has been bolstered by Donald Trump’s presidential election victory in November, signaling a potential shift toward more crypto-friendly policies in Washington. The president-elect’s cabinet picks, including hedge fund manager Scott Bessent and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnik for key economic roles, indicate a strong pro-crypto stance . Trump’s selection of crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC chair further underscores this sentiment. Trump has reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with Powell’s decision-making but Powell remains steadfast, stating he has no intention of resigning. This interplay between Trump’s crypto-positive policies and Powell’s cautious approach adds complexity to the evolving regulatory landscape. An Evolving Financial Ecosystem As Bitcoin continues to climb, surpassing gold in performance, its positioning as “digital gold” gains traction. Powell’s assertion that Bitcoin is a competitor to gold rather than the U.S. dollar highlights its growing role as a speculative store of value. With policy shifts and cabinet changes on the horizon, 2024 could mark a pivotal year for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional financial systems.

Could that finally change during the ongoing bull cycle? Perplexity weighs in. On September 4, the project celebrated 2,000 since its official launch, which took place on March 14, 2019. Since then, it has amassed over 14 million customers who have completed the necessary KYC verification. However, the actual mainnet of the project, which promises to allow people to mine crypto directly from their smartphones and change the complexion of the Internet, is yet to be released to the public. Moreover, the team recently announced another extension for users to submit KYC applications from November until December 31, 2024. This is the second such extension, as the deadline was initially set for September. The current deadline coincides with the official mainnet and token launch date. Although the team continues to reassure that both will indeed launch on the last day of 2024, the community’s doubts have gone through the roof. As such, we decided to ask the popular AI chatbot – Perplexity, about its views on whether Pi Network’s mainnet will indeed see the day of light on December 31 or even during the ongoing bull cycle. It answered that the more favorable market conditions should definitely incentivize the team to follow through with the promised launch, as they can benefit from the overall landscape. “The broader cryptocurrency market conditions play a crucial role in determining the timing of the mainnet launch. A bullish market can enhance user interest and investment in the Pi Network, while a bearish market could lead to hesitance among potential users and investors,” – said the chatbot. Although it has not officially launched, the PI token has surged in price to $50, and Perplexity predicted that it could go as high as $100 even before its public release.

Cathie Wood Praises Incoming SEC Chair, Highlights Bitcoin's Growth Potential Speaking about the leadership transition, Wood said Atkins is expected to reverse regulatory restrictions placed on digital assets by outgoing Chairman Gary Gensler and strengthen protections of private property rights in the digital space. Wood’s comments echo a growing sentiment in the financial sector about Bitcoin’s transformative potential, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also commenting on the subject, describing it as a “virtual digital version of gold.” Powell noted that the gold market is worth around $15 trillion, while Bitcoin's market value is only $2 trillion, drawing attention to the huge difference in value between the two. “Bitcoin is still in its early stages,” Powell said. “It represents much more than gold when you consider its utility and potential in the digital economy.” Wood echoed this sentiment, emphasizing Bitcoin’s expanding role as a store of value and its capacity to disrupt traditional financial systems. Wood's comments come amid growing interest in Bitcoin as institutional investors increasingly view the cryptocurrency as a critical asset class. As regulatory clarity increases under new leadership, market participants predict that Bitcoin and other digital assets will gain greater legitimacy and adoption. *This is not investment advice.

Additionally, the surge was accompanied by a sharp increase in social sentiment and the liquidation of $132 million in short positions. Meanwhile, Mt. Gox transferred 24,000 BTC shortly after the milestone, which raised questions about its possible market impact. North American miner Hut 8 is getting ready to take advantage of Bitcoin’s access as it announced plans to expand its Bitcoin reserve through a $500 million stock repurchase program. Bitcoin Breaks $100K While Altcoin Gains Fade Away Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed its position as the dominant force in the crypto market after hitting a massive milestone by surpassing $100,000 for the first time ever on Dec. 5. Bitcoin's dominance , which is a measure of its share in the total crypto market value, rebounded sharply to 57% after falling to a recent low of 54.7% on Dec. 4. The surge to a new high of $104,000 was a dramatic reversal for Bitcoin, which has been stuck in consolidation around the $95,000 level while altcoins stole the spotlight. BTC’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Leading altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Tron (TRX), and XRP recently reached all-time highs. This led to a dip in Bitcoin's dominance, but the trend reversed after Bitcoin surged past the six-figure threshold. Analysts like Income Sharks humorously suggested that Bitcoin’s rise was a reminder of its ”king” status in the middle of the altcoin frenzy. The market’s excitement was mirrored by the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index , which climbed to a high of 94 on Nov. 22, when Bitcoin was nearing $99,000, before settling at an “extreme greed” level of 84 after the latest rally. Social sentiment also reflected the euphoria in the market, and Google Trends reported a sharp increase in Bitcoin-related searches on Dec. 5. Bitcoin’s quick ascent also led to large market liquidations, with over $132 million in short positions wiped out in just four hours, according to CoinGlass . Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was just as excited about BTC’s achievement, and shared his thoughts about Bitcoin’s exceptional performance. Armstrong pointed out that $100 invested in Bitcoin at the time of Coinbase's founding would now be worth close to $1.5 million. The crypto industry is already calling Dec. 5 “$100K Day,” and many people are celebrating the cryptocurrency’s historic achievement. Mt. Gox Transfers 24K Bitcoin After $100K Break The long-defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox moved more than 24,000 Bitcoin, which is valued at approximately $2.5 billion, to an unknown address very shortly after Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 milestone. Data from Arkham Intelligence revealed that the exchange transferred 24,051 Bitcoin to an address with no prior activity at 2:45 am UTC. This was its first big transaction since Nov. 12. The timing of the move coincided with Bitcoin’s price surge, and the transaction was executed just 12 minutes after it crossed $100,000 and less than 30 minutes before it peaked at $104,000 on Coinbase. The reason for the transfer is still unclear, though similar movements in the past have been linked to preparations for creditor payouts. Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy in 2014, and has been working to resolve claims from creditors who lost access to their Bitcoin more than a decade ago. While these large-scale transfers raise some concerns about potential sell-offs that could impact Bitcoin’s price, some analysts believe the market has already accounted for the sell-side pressure as these creditor repayments have been anticipated for years. Many creditors also revealed that they are reluctant to sell their Bitcoin despite finally regaining access. A July poll on Reddit suggested that most recipients were holding onto their funds, even after the exchange started processing initial payouts earlier this year. The Mt. Gox trustee also recently extended the repayment deadline to Oct. 31, 2025. Mt.Gox Bitcoin holdings (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) After the latest transfer, Mt. Gox still holds a very large reserve of 39,878 Bitcoin, valued at around $4.1 billion. The latest move reignited discussions about its impact on the market, and some see it as a bearish signal. Hut 8 Plans Bitcoin Reserve Many companies are running to get their piece of the Bitcoin pie after its recent success. Hut 8, a North American Bitcoin mining company, launched a $500 million stock repurchase program to fund growth initiatives, including buying Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. The at-the-market (ATM) offering program will allow the company to sell up to $500 million in common stock. The proceeds will be directed toward developing power and digital infrastructure, expanding its Bitcoin reserve, and addressing corporate needs like capital expenditures and debt repayment. CEO Asher Genoot shared details about just how important the ATM and stock repurchase programs are in navigating volatile markets. They also play a major role in strengthening the company’s treasury management strategy. Under the new capital management plan, Hut 8 may repurchase up to 4.68 million shares of common stock, representing 5% of the total outstanding shares, over the next year. Hut 8’s stock (HUT) rebounded strongly after the announcement was made on Dec. 4, and surged 326% to $27.03 since its January dip to $6.33 that was caused by a short-seller report that unsettled investors. The firm recently filed a motion to dismiss a shareholder class-action lawsuit, and called it opportunistic Hut 8 became the latest of many companies adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. Other firms, including AI education tech company Genius Group, biopharmaceutical firm Hoth Therapeutics, video platform Rumble, Canadian wellness company Jiva Technologies, and Semler Scientific all announced similar strategies recently. Paul Atkins Nominated as SEC Chair by Trump Bitcoin’s price could be boosted even more after President-elect Donald Trump officially nominated Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, to succeed Gary Gensler as the head of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In an announcement on Dec. 4, Trump praised Atkins’ experience as a former SEC commissioner and his work as CEO of Patomak Global Partners. Trump also mentioned Atkins’ role as Co-Chairman of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017, where he focused on the digital assets industry. Atkins is known for his commitment to transparency and investor protection during his tenure at the SEC from 2002 to 2008, and was a key part of Trump’s campaign promise to appoint a crypto-friendly SEC leader. Atkins’ nomination happened after the resignation of Gary Gensler, which was announced on Nov. 21 after widespread criticism from the crypto industry. Gensler’s tenure was riddled with aggressive regulatory actions, and the SEC even filed 104 lawsuits against crypto firms between 2021 and 2023. These legal battles reportedly cost the industry $426 million in legal fees. The Blockchain Association criticized the SEC under Gensler for not providing clear regulations, and called for an end to what they described as “law-fare” against the crypto sector. Gensler’s departure already sparked optimism in the crypto market, and many analysts predicted an extended altcoin rally heading into 2025. The resignation also led to a surge in filings for Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and firms like Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares quickly submitted applications after the announcement. Pantera’s chief legal officer, Katrina Paglia, also suggested that many of the SEC’s lawsuits against blockchain projects and crypto firms could be quietly dropped under new leadership. Overall, the crypto industry sees Atkins’ nomination as a pivotal step toward clearer and more favorable regulation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6387/bitcoin-hits-six-figure-milestone-dominance-surges-to-57,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

The move comes amidst pending compensation claims, with the payout timeline for creditors extended to October 31, 2025. Mt.Gox Moves Large BTC Tranche The defunct exchange transferred around 27,871 BTC, valued at almost $2.9 billion at current prices, to an unknown address with no previous history, starting with “1N7j” at 2:45 am UTC on December 5. This was the exchange’s first transfer since November 12. The transfer happened minutes after BTC hit the $100,000 milestone and less than half an hour before it set a new all-time high. The transfer was detected by Arkham Intelligence, which also recorded around $3.8k BTC, valued at around $386 million, to a cold wallet. It isn’t known why Mt.Gox has moved a significant part of its holdings, although similar moves in the past have almost always been a precursor to giving payouts to the exchange’s creditors. The exchange still holds around 39,878 BTC, worth over $4 billion, in its wallet. The latest transfer comes after Mt.Gox moved around 2,500 BTC to an unknown address on November 12. The bankrupt exchange has moved funds regularly to resolve outstanding compensation claims from former users. Impact On BTC The transfer of such a large number of BTC is usually viewed as a bearish development for the asset's price, as it could mean billions worth of BTC is being sent to users who could sell after being unable to access their assets for over a decade. However, despite historical price sensitivity to large movements, recent Mt.Gox transfers have had minimal impact on the price of BTC. Analysts believe sell-side pressure from Mt.Gox payments is significantly overblown because the market has already priced them in. However, concerns persist that full compensation could impact prices if some creditors opt to sell their holdings. Mt.Gox creditors receive their payouts in BTC, and most creditors stated in a poll they were in no rush to sell their holdings. The Mt.Gox trustee managing the BTC and payouts to creditors recently pushed the deadline to repay outstanding claims to October 31, 2025, extending the deadline by a full year. The trustee stated many users had still not received their repayments because they had yet to complete the necessary procedures. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Powell stated this position yesterday at the New York Times DealBook Summit while referring to Bitcoin as a speculative asset. Bitcoin Is a Speculative Asset Like Gold For context, assets tagged as speculative are mainly acquired with the expectation that their price would spike over time. This is similar to how investors speculate on the value of gold.Notably, Powell described Bitcoin as the digital version of gold, suggesting that people only use both for speculative purposes. He opined that Bitcoin should not be considered a rival to the U.S. Dollar because it is not used as a store of value or everyday payments. However, he contended that Bitcoin is highly volatile. Hence, it should be compared to gold.Powell Highlights Fed's Role for Crypto Furthermore, the Federal Reserve chair revealed that the apex bank mainly observes how cryptocurrencies interact with the banking system in general. Despite monitoring crypto, Powell clarified that the Fed does not directly regulate the market. When asked whether he has any stake in crypto, Powell said he owns none, including Bitcoin. He noted that not owning cryptos aligns with his commitment to maintaining impartiality in the market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been attracting the attention of investors, from retail to corporate. Many of these investors consider the world’s largest cryptocurrency a hedge against inflation. However, Powell’s commentary presents a contrary perspective, describing Bitcoin as a speculative asset similar to gold rather than the dollar, which is commonly used for savings and payments. Bitcoin Hits $100,000 The development comes amid Bitcoin’s surge to the $100,000 mark. Recall that Bitcoin failed on multiple attempts to clinch this target. However, it finally succeeded earlier today, setting a new all-time high record of $103,900. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $103,091, reflecting a modest increase of 6.3% in the past 24 hours and 8.06% in the last seven days.

Analysts Weigh In","Ethereum (ETH) appears to be finally waking up from its slumber as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has jumped 8% in the past 24 hours, surpassing the key $3,800 price level. Is An ETH God Candle On The Horizon? Ethereum’s rise appears to align with declining Bitcoin (BTC) dominance. This important metric is tracked to gauge the proportion of the total crypto market cap commanded by the top cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps 10% As DeFi Sentiment Rebounds With Trump’s Victory According to the chart below, BTC dominance has been falling dramatically over the past two weeks – sliding from 61.1% on November 20 to 54.9% at the time of writing. As previously reported, trading firm QCP Capital highlighted BTC dominance sliding below 58% as a key condition that could signal the onset of the altcoin season. With ETH now surpassing the $3,800 level, analysts are weighing in on how far the digital asset can rally. Crypto analyst @venturefounder shared his target for ETH on X, pointing to a prolonged cup-and-handle pattern forming for ETH since November 2021. He noted that if ETH decisively breaks $3,800, it could climb as high as $7,346. Similarly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared his insights on ETH’s recent price action. Martinez emphasized that the $3,300 support level could be a ‘potential buying opportunity’ should the digital asset pullback from its recent surge. Martinez added that his mid-term target for ETH remains $6,000, while the long-term target is $10,000. The analyst also highlighted the Ethereum network’s steady growth over the past month, with more than 134,000 new Ethereum addresses added daily. Another crypto enthusiast, @MisterSpread noted that if ETH breaks the $4,000 area, there is a “high chance we see a God candle to $5,000.” Indeed, ETH breaking out of a three-year long downtrend and attempting to establish a new all-time high (ATH) has piqued the attention of the entire crypto industry. Ethereum Fundamentals Continue Getting Stronger Although BTC has led much of the current crypto rally, experts believe Ethereum might be the time to shine due to the multiple positive developments in the top smart contract platform. For instance, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) are finally attracting large daily inflows, rivaling BTC ETFs consistently. Further, several proposed network upgrades – including the Ethereum Improvement Proposal-7781 and the possibility of reduction in the amount of ETH required to participate in network staking could serve as catalysts for ETH to hit a new ATH. That said, concerns remain about ETH’s ‘ultrasound money’ narrative due to the inflation surge witnessed in the cryptocurrency’s issuance rate. ETH trades at $3,820 at press time, up 8 % in the past 24 hours.

Trump’s Announcement The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is set to experience a leadership overhaul with the appointment of Paul Atkins as its new chair. Following the resignation of Gary Gensler, President-elect Donald Trump announced Atkins' nomination, signaling a likely change in regulatory priorities, particularly concerning the crypto industry. President-elect Trump shared the news via Truth Social, describing Atkins as a proponent of ""common sense regulations"" and a supporter of innovative capital markets. Trump emphasized Atkins' recognition of digital assets as central to America's economic advancement. This appointment reflects the administration's intent to foster a more crypto-friendly environment. Transition From Gensler’s Tenure Gary Gensler, who will step down in January, led the SEC with an aggressive regulatory agenda. His tenure was marked by over 40 rules aimed at increasing transparency and mitigating financial risks. However, his approach drew criticism, especially from the crypto sector, which accused the SEC of pursuing enforcement actions without providing clear regulatory guidance. Gensler's focus on enforcement led to lawsuits against numerous crypto firms for allegedly operating outside existing securities laws. While he classified Bitcoin as a commodity, Gensler avoided clear stances on other cryptocurrencies, leading to uncertainty within the industry. Atkins’ Regulatory Philosophy Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, is expected to pivot the agency's regulatory stance. Known for his conservative approach to governance and support for market innovation, Atkins will likely adopt policies aimed at capital formation and provide clearer regulatory guidelines for the crypto space. Atkins has been a vocal advocate for the digital asset industry, co-chairing the Token Alliance at the Digital Chamber of Commerce since 2017. Through his consultancy, Potomak Global Partners, he has advised digital finance firms on navigating regulatory complexities. His leadership style is characterized by collaboration and maintaining strong professional relationships, in contrast to Gensler's contentious approach. Industry and Political Response The appointment has been well-received by many within the financial and crypto sectors. Eric Pan, CEO of the Investment Company Institute, called Atkins a ""supremely well-qualified nominee,"" citing his extensive experience and commitment to fair markets. Trump’s selection of Atkins aligns with his broader vision for making the U.S. a global leader in crypto innovation, including promises of clearer regulatory frameworks and potential initiatives like a national Bitcoin reserve.

Currently trading at $0.4819, XLM has dropped 6.15% drop in the past 24 hours. However, its staggering 428% growth over the past month has spurred bullish sentiment across the crypto community. The market is currently on a historic run, and to see if XLM will join the market in what could be the biggest bull run in history, we consulted ChatGPT for its outlook on XLM’s value by December 31, 2024. ChatGPT’s Prediction: $1 by Year-End According to ChatGPT, XLM could reach $1 by the end of 2024. This projection marks a significant 107.5% increase from its current price, which would propel the cryptocurrency past its all-time high of $0.9381, recorded in January 2018. While such a surge may seem ambitious, ChatGPT outlined several factors that support this prediction. Factors Supporting XLM’s Potential Growth Adoption in Peer-to-peer Payment Systems: ChatGPT emphasized that XLM’s increasing adoption in payment systems is a major driver behind its bullish projection. Stellar has partnerships with major firms like MoneyGram and has made significant strides across the globe, literally saving lives through blockchain technology. If this adoption grows, there is no telling how high XLM can climb. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Shift in the Regulatory Environment: ChatGPT also noted that the shift in the U.S. regulatory market could help XLM grow. Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as his SEC Chair, and once Gensler leaves on January 20, Atkins could help Trump implement pro-crypto policies and aid market growth. Ecosystem Expansion: Another factor cited by ChatGPT is an expansion of the Stellar ecosystem. Solana and XRP have performed spectacularly, as their ecosystems are growing due to increased attention and the launch of meme coins on their networks . If XLM can expand its feature set, it could attract more users and grow its ecosystem. Macro Trends in the Crypto Market: ChatGPT also pointed to broader market trends as a potential tailwind for XLM. If the cryptocurrency market continues its upward trajectory, assets with strong fundamentals like XLM would perform well. The anticipated entry of institutional investors and increased adoption of blockchain technology could further amplify this trend. XLM’s recent performance has been spectacular, and if it can sustain the momentum, it could hit $1 by the end of the year as ChatGPT predicted.

While market makers' hedging is likely to keep BTC supported at around $100,000, the heightened activity raises the risk of pullbacks for other cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, tapped a record high above $103,000 early Thursday, following President-elect Donald Trump's decision to appoint pro-crypto Paul Atkins as chairman for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The breakout sent traders chasing the price rally, pushing funding rates for perpetual futures skywards, a sign of growing demand for and overcrowding in long positions. In this scenario, a slight pullback can result in large liquidations (forced selling by exchanges due to margin shortages) and increased downside volatility.  Support may come from the options market, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. When options prices rise faster than that of the underlying asset — that is, when the so-called gamma imbalance is positive — market makers tend to sell their holdings to keep their net exposure neutral. They buy when it's negative, acting as a contrarian force and limiting price swings.  ""BTC can be stable at around $100,000 in the short-term, helped by the hedging activity of market makers,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""This support from the options market may offset the impact of deleveraging to a certain extent.""  The annualized funding rate for bitcoin surged to nearly 100%, surpassing rates for purely speculative tokens like DOGE, data from VeloData show. Other coins, such as XRP, CRO and XMR, also boast funding rates in excess of 100%.   ""That EOD [volume weighted average price] suggests Saylor blew another few billion, and the [BTC] funding rates make me think this final move was purely lever-driven,"" said Felix Hartmann, founder and managing partner of Hartmann Capital, referring to Michael Saylor, executive chairman of MicroStrategy, the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin. ""Wouldn’t be shocked at a good old 20-30% bull market correction here. 80s are fair game.""    Hartmann stressed the need for additional demand over and above MSTR's purchases to keep the bull run going, a view echoed by several observers on social media. They suggested that either the market continues to rally, justifying the costs associated with holding bullish bets, or turns lower in a sharp correction.  Even with market makers' activity, bitcoin price volatility could return toward the end of the year.  ""The positive gamma at $105,000 in options expiring on Dec. 27 could bring sufficient gravity, but after the expiry, it will disappear, boosting price uncertainty,"" Ardern told CoinDesk.  Options are derivative contracts, offering the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call or a bullish bet gives the right to buy, while a put confers the right to sell.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | CRO,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | CRO,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/05/market-makers-may-keep-bitcoin-around-100-k-as-overheated-market-faces-pullback-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c182aa8c5c9d4ff69dbc32a899103b70c13ecea5-1280x833.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Several altcoins have followed suit, including ETH, which has jumped to above $3,900. BTC Finally Goes Beyond $100K It has been a wild journey ever since Donald Trump won the US elections precisely a month ago. The primary cryptocurrency stood at around $68,000 at the time but started to surge in value immediately. It flew past its March all-time high and kept climbing in the following weeks to peak at $99,800 on November 22. After coming just inches away from going into six-digit territory, the bears finally came out to play and propelled a massive leg down that pushed BTC to under $91,000 a few days later. However, the bull run was unfazed and resumed in the following weeks. Just yesterday, bitcoin jumped from $95,000 to $99,000 and, earlier this morning finally blasted through the six-digit milestone. Moreover, it kept climbing and tapped a fresh all-time high of $103,500. Despite trading slightly below $103,000 now, BTC’s market cap has shot up to $2.03 trillion on CG. Its dominance over the alts has risen to 52.7% after losing some traction in the past week or so. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 5.12.2024. Source: TradingView ETH on the Rise Ethereum has remained relatively out of focus due to other massive gainers in the past several weeks, such as XRP, DOGE, as well as BNB , and TRX as of late. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency is gaining again and has soared past $3,900 after a 5.5% daily surge. DOGE, SHIB, BCH, DOT, SUI, and CRO are the other notable price gainers from the larger-cap alts. In contrast, BNB, TRX, AVAX, XLM, HBAR, and TON have dropped today, and so has XRP, which is somewhat surprising given Trump’s pick for the next SEC chair. Nevertheless, the total crypto market cap saw a record of its own at well above $3.850 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Bitcoin’s surge past the $100,000 price mark has elated the crypto community. After an unsuccessful initial attempt, the pioneering digital asset trounced the six-figure level on Thursday.With the bounce, market speculators now expect higher prices. As bullish sentiments swell, targets like $150,000, $250,000, and even $1 million have emerged for the premier asset.Meanwhile, seasoned intelligence firm IntoTheBlock has given a sneak peek of what to expect from Bitcoin after the $100,000 breach. In a recent analysis , the firm predicted that Bitcoin's realistic top could sit between $130,000 and $190,000.IntoTheBlock Predicts Bitcoin’s Reasonable TopThe firm lauded Bitcoin’s boundless potential in a tweet today, noting that its limited supply and growing institutional adoption will ensure a continued price upswing. Further, it recalled Bitcoin’s performance during its cyclical upsurges.The commentary emphasized that Bitcoin has always posted lower gain percentages in each bull cycle compared to the previous one. For context, Bitcoin recorded a 7,900% upswing in 2013, 2,560% in 2017, and 594% in 2021.IntoTheBlock inferred that the capital required to maintain the upside increases as Bitcoin's price surges. Hence, calls for an uptick to $1 million this cycle, which would see Bitcoin attain a market cap of $19.7 trillion, might be unreasonable.Given the diminishing returns on Bitcoin’s cyclical performance, the analytical firm stated that a 100-200% surge for Bitcoin post-halving is a “reasonable expectation.” As a result, IntoTheBlock speculates further upswings to between $130,000 and $190,000. Bitcoin Halving Run Exception for Bitcoin Surge Past TopMeanwhile, IntoTheBlock stated that Bitcoin would push past its predicted top on account of a super bullish occurrence. Per the commentary, the creation of a US Bitcoin reserve would catalyze a surge past its $190,000 top prediction.Discussions around a strategic reserve for Bitcoin has gained momentum in the US following Donald Trump’s win. He and Senator Cynthia Lummis teased the idea during an appearance at the Nashville Bitcoin conference in July.Although Trump has not made any related comments since the election win, Lummis has incessantly fronted the idea. Having proposed the bill , the pro-crypto senator has repeatedly insisted that it would come to fruition soon.Amid this prospect, IntoTheBlock insisted that the creation of the US stockpile would be the only factor driving Bitcoin higher than its call.

Terra Luna joined the upside journey, soaring 21.13% on its daily chart as it climbed from $0.6520 to $0.7898. Notably, the solid jump saw the altcoin breaking free from a descending channel, signaling a significant buyer comeback. LUNA trades at $0.7200, and bulls target the vital resistance at $0.895. Breaching this obstacle could catalyze smooth upswings to $1.50. That would translate to a 108.33% surge from the current values. Furthermore, Terra’s price actions appeared to form a golden cross, confirming possible trend reversals. LUNA price ready for a 100% jump The latest breakout from a descending channel formation indicated a significant change in market sentiments. LUNA bulls target the crucial resistance barrier at $0.895. The level remains vital in determining whether Terra will sustain the latest breakout. Stability above $0.895 might catalyze a massive upswing to $1.50. That would mean a 108.33% surge from LUNA’s current price. LUNA price prediction: what technicals say Indicators support the asset’s bullish outlook. The emerging golden cross cements the chances of bullish reversals. This technical signal often confirms the beginning of a solid uptrend. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests a robust uptrend, with the MACD line well beyond the signal line. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index at 78 suggests overbought market conditions. That signals potential retracements for LUNA before uptrend resumption. Meanwhile, the social dominance hit 0.165 from 0.100 within a day. The hiked social attention can attract significant market interest to support stable rallies. Nonetheless, magnified social dominance often triggers massive volatility, with sentiments prone to rapid shifts in either direction. Further, Terra’s long-to-short ratio is 50.61% to 49.39% ( Coinglass data ), highlighting a near balance between buyers and sellers. The equilibrium reflects uncertainty in LUNA’s future performance. Nonetheless, a successful move past the $0.895 resistance would see buyers dominating. Also, the prevailing market sentiment suggests that price dips could be short-lived. LUNA price action The altcoin painted its daily chart green, up 10% from the opening price to hover at $0.7200 at press time. Source – Coinmarketcap Its 24-hour trading volume has increased by 55% to $368.35 million, magnifying trader optimism. Social metrics, technical indicators, and LUNA’s latest price moves suggest trend reversals. Nevertheless, the $0.895 resistance remains crucial for the token’s upcoming trajectory. Breaching this hurdle and a golden cross completion would catalyze impressive upswings to $1.50. However, caution remains paramount, as RSI’s overbought conditions and the evenness between sellers and buyers highlight possible volatility. Meanwhile, analysts remain confident about an altcoin season after Bitcoin’s surge past $100,000.

GameFi , a sector that combines gaming with decentralized finance, has faced a sharp decline after its initial surge during the 2022 crypto bull run, with a new report showing that 93% of projects have failed. A survey by ChainPlay, in collaboration with Storible, analyzed over 3,200 GameFi projects and found that many of their tokens have dropped an average of 95% from their all-time highs. The report also shows that GameFi projects have an alarmingly short lifespan, with an average of just four months before most fade. State of GameFi projects in 2024 | Source: ChainPlay “Compared to other crypto projects, such as memecoins with an average lifespan of one year and typical crypto projects with an average lifespan of three years, GameFi projects have an even shorter lifespan, highlighting their heightened instability and inability to sustain momentum.” ChainPlay You might also like: Nansen: GameFi market set for $301.5b surge amid ecosystem expansion Oddly enough, venture capital involvement in GameFi has also been hit or miss.

37247219,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623022,1733391339,Trump might be forced to choose between saving Bitcoin or USD next year. What is he likely to do?,"Donald Trump’s next financial war might not be with BRICS nations or even the Federal Reserve. It’s likely going to be with himself. The former president, back in power and already stirring up global drama, may soon face an impossible decision: save the U.S. dollar or bet big on Bitcoin. For a man who thrives on chaos, the stakes couldn’t be higher. On one side, Trump is aggressively defending the dollar’s dominance, threatening a 100% tariff on BRICS countries if they move forward with plans to ditch the greenback. On the other, his rumored Bitcoin reserve plan could make the U.S. the first major government to officially back crypto. These two positions cannot coexist. The outcome will define global trade, crypto markets, and America’s financial future. Trump’s BRICS problem The BRICS nations got tired of playing by America’s financial rules and have been meeting to figure out how to break free from the dollar. At a recent summit hosted by Trump’s buddy Russian president Vladimir Putin , they openly discussed creating their own currency or strengthening trade using local currencies. The goal was simply to reduce reliance on the dollar and, by extension, U.S. economic power. Trump isn’t taking it lightly. He fired off a warning on Truth Social, demanding that BRICS nations back down. “Any country trying to undermine the dollar will wave goodbye to access to the U.S. market,” he wrote. His response? Tariffs. Not just any tariffs, but a 100% tariff on all BRICS exports. Yeesh! Imagine the fallout. A tariff this extreme would send U.S. consumer prices through the roof. From smartphones to oil to basic food items, costs would skyrocket. American companies relying on imports from BRICS nations would face devastating disruptions. But Trump sees this as a necessary decision to protect the dollar. Still, the plan could backfire. His heavy-handed tactics will provoke the BRICS into speeding up their anti-dollar efforts. If they succeed, the global financial system could move away from America’s control faster than anyone expects. Even allies like Japan and the European Union might start exploring alternatives. The Bitcoin factor Trump’s plans involve the U.S. buying 200,000 bitcoins a year for five years, eventually creating a national reserve of one million bitcoins. But to be very honest, Bitcoin isn’t exactly a safe bet. Sure, it’s trading at $100,000 now, but its history is one of wild volatility. Prices can swing dramatically overnight. Using Bitcoin as a national reserve asset is like building a house on quicksand. The risks are massive, especially for the world’s most powerful economy. Then there’s the funding. Trump’s plan involves selling off U.S. gold reserves to buy Bitcoin. This is controversial for obvious reasons. Gold has been the go-to asset for stability during economic crises for centuries. Trading it for Bitcoin, which has only been around for 15 years, is a gamble that could backfire spectacularly. If Trump does make America go all-in on Bitcoin, he will have to inadvertently hurt the dollar, like the legendary Arthur Hayes predicted . A government-backed Bitcoin reserve would send a strong signal to global markets that crypto is the future. And while that would be quite amazing for us, it’d actually weaken confidence in the dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency. Investors might start dumping U.S. assets for crypto, triggering a financial revolution that even Trump might not be able to control. Is the dollar set for collapse? Financial experts are also sounding the alarm on Trump’s plans. UBS Wealth Management has advised investors to bet against the dollar’s continued strength. “We caution against chasing USD strength; instead, we suggest selling dollar upside potential for yield pickup,” they wrote in a recent note. UBS recommends shorting the euro below $1.05, the British pound below $1.25, and the Australian dollar below $0.63. Meanwhile, currencies like the Swiss franc are gaining attention as safer bets. UBS favors buying the franc above 0.90 against the dollar. Defensive currencies like the franc could become the go-to for investors looking to hedge against dollar weakness. Not all currencies will benefit equally. UBS warns that currencies heavily tied to U.S. exports, such as the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, could suffer if Trump’s tariffs disrupt trade. The same goes for China. Now to answer the big question:- Trump is likely to stick with the dollar. Despite his commendable Bitcoin ambitions, the risks of undermining U.S. financial power are too big, even for him. He’ll fight BRICS with tariffs, protect the dollar’s dominance, and maybe toss Bitcoin a bone to keep the crypto crowd happy. But when push comes to shove, the dollar isn’t just America’s currency, it’s its strong weapon. The president knows that, and he’ll play it safe when the stakes are this high.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-forced-choose-saving-bitcoin-usd/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37247219.jpeg

Currently, the crypto market is riding a wave of optimism as governments and institutions globally adopt blockchain technology, creating a foundation for wider acceptance and investment in digital assets. This shift highlights the ecosystem’s maturity and its potential for long-term expansion. Analysts predict Bitcoin will continue to gain traction, pushing its price higher in 2025. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Binance’s Head of Regional Markets Vishal Sacheendran said, “In the next year, the outlook for crypto appears increasingly promising. As regulatory frameworks become more comprehensive, the industry is likely to see enhanced security measures, greater transparency, and improved accessibility for retail and institutional investors. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs and, more recently, Bitcoin ETF options, has played a key role in the recent market rally and simplified access for institutional investors, allowing them to gain exposure and manage risks more effectively.” A Springboard, Not a Finish Line Presto Research views Bitcoin’s $100,000 milestone as a springboard rather than a finish line, highlighting its relative infancy compared to other major macro assets. With Bitcoin’s market cap still modest, it remains inaccessible for top-tier institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds, public pensions, and central banks, which require sufficient market depth to execute sizable trades. Presto expects $1 million to be the next pivotal milestone, where Bitcoin’s market cap would rival gold’s $18 trillion valuation, making it a viable option for these asset allocators. However, surpassing $100,000 brings challenges, particularly selling pressure from long-term holders (addresses holding BTC for 155+ days). Historical trends show significant hodler selling at new all-time highs, with ~1 million BTC already offloaded in this cycle for $62 billion at an average price of $67K. Encouragingly, this cycle lacks concentrated “relief selling” seen at prior peaks. Presto noted that demand growth, more than selling pressure, determines market tops, and strong demand signals – boosted by ETF approvals, crypto-friendly policies, and global liquidity expansion – could absorb selling pressure and sustain Bitcoin’s rally.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum surges with record inflows while Rollblock’s GambleFi project captures trader attention, promising 880% gains amid BNB’s security struggles. Table of Contents Ethereum records massive capital inflows during ongoing rally BNB loses investor confidence after several sandwich attacks Rollblock positions itself as top low cap crypto in Q4 altseason Ethereum is regaining momentum during this bull season as its institutional products reached a yearly high in net inflows. Meanwhile, BNB has lost its position in the Top 5 cryptos list after its smart chain network was manipulated by several Sandwich attacks. Amidst this sentiment, savvy traders are diversifying their wallets by investing in Rollblock’s new GambleFi project that is already poised for 880% gains. Ethereum records massive capital inflows during ongoing rally Ethereum is reclaiming its market dominance after losing investor confidence over the last few months. Ethereum has recorded a massive capital inflow worth $634 million over the last seven days which is typically a strong indicator of bullish dominance. In addition, Ethereum’s institutional products have also reached a new yearly high by exceeding $2.2 billion in net inflows. Despite these positive indicators, Ethereum’s price has crashed by 2.08% over the last 24 hours to its current selling price of $3,553.19. Even though Ethereum’s volume has also decreased by 1.28%, analysts believe Ethereum will continue its upward trend for the next few weeks after overcoming this brief correction. Since Ethereum’s RSI and MACD indicator are both suggesting more room for growth, Ethereum’s price could surge toward the $4,178 and $4,652 levels within the next few weeks. BNB loses investor confidence after several sandwich attacks BNB was gaining investor confidence when its smart chain network became infiltrated by sandwich attacks. More than 35% of the blocks on BNB Smart Chain were manipulated by Sandwich attacks in November because of BNB’s transparency and decentralization. Since these attacks artificially manipulate the price of an asset on DEXs, investors are losing confidence in BNB’s security protocols. BNB is currently trading for $732.09 after an intraday decline worth 0.84%. Since BNB’s Momentum Indicator and MACD level are both flashing sell signals now, analysts believe BNB could experience steeper losses if it doesn’t address these Sandwich attacks soon. If BNB investors begin booking profits, BNB’s price could crash to the $569.1 support.

Rollblock’s viral GambleFi project is bringing fun and thrill back to the obsolete world of crypto trading by combining online gaming with massive crypto earnings. Since Rollblock is already seeing a huge influx of savvy traders and high rollers in stage 8 of its presale, analysts are expecting a total of 880% gains for RBLK ahead of its official launch on the open market. Rollblock’s strategy to combine decentralized and centralized gaming into one crypto native iGambling platform is the main reason why this altcoin is already dominating the DeFi market. Instead of offering boring games like other play-to-earn tokens, Rollblock is bringing a variety of casino classics like roulette, poker, blackjack and slots to its ecosystem. In addition, Rollblock also has a variety of new web3-based titles such as KENO and Max Car Racing. The best part about Rollblock’s gaming library is that all 7,000+ games are fully audited and regulated by SolidProof and Gaming Curacao which ensures that the platform is 100% secure. To make things even better, Rollblock encrypts all financial data and bets on Ethereum’s immutable blockchain to give traders the most provably fair odds with no third-party manipulations. As traders play and win these games, they can accumulate more RBLK tokens that can be staked for a weekly passive income. Rollblock shares up to 30% of its weekly revenue with current holders as staking rewards through an open market buyback mechanism. As this massive buyback increases Rollblock’s demand, the supply cap of 1 billion tokens puts deflationary pressure on the token’s price. Although Rollblock is currently trading for $0.037 per token, analysts are already projecting another price jump within the next few days because of Rollblock’s high demand.

BIT Mining said it had mined 84,485.42 LTC (worth $10 million at current prices) and 227,908,250 DOGE (worth a whopping $100 million) since it started its self-mining business. It reported having over 5,500 active mining machines, representing 1.32% of the global network hash rate in LTC, DOGE and the smaller Belcoin (BEL).  Such gains on its DOGE operations came as the token’s prices have more than tripled since late September on repeated endorsements by technocrat Elon Musk and the proposal of a Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), a non-governmental department under the upcoming Trump administration.  ""The recent rally in Litecoin and Dogecoin, fueled in part by Elon Musk's influence and the changing regulatory landscape in the US after the Trump win, has had a major impact on mining profitability,"" Dr. Youwei Yang, VP of Mining at BIT Mining, said in a statement. ""Many analysts predict this upward trend will continue through 2025, reflecting confidence in DOGE's potential and the broader growth of the cryptocurrency industry.""  Mining is the process by which transactions for various cryptocurrencies are verified and added to the blockchain using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, which validate these transactions, in return for token rewards.

37246440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=657650,1733390108,"Bitcoin Price Hits Historic $104,000: Key Factors Fueling The Surge","Bitcoin has shattered previous records, soaring past the $100,000 milestone for the first time ever to reach an all-time high of $104,088 late Wednesday in New York. The flagship cryptocurrency had dipped to $94,587 on Wednesday but staged a remarkable comeback. Several key factors contributed to this unprecedented surge: #1 Fed Chair Powell Compares Bitcoin To Gold In a significant acknowledgment from the traditional financial sector, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed Bitcoin during the New York Times DealBook Summit. When questioned about the perception of Bitcoin as a symbol of faith or lack thereof in the US dollar and the Federal Reserve, Powell offered a nuanced perspective. “I don’t think that’s how people think about it,” Powell remarked. “People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset, right? It’s like gold. It’s just like gold, only it’s virtual. It’s digital. People are not using it as a form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar; it’s really a competitor for gold.” This comparison to gold, a traditional store of value, was probably seen by many as another strong legitimization of Bitcoin in the financial ecosystem. If your central bank owns gold, but rejects digital gold… they’re done. How did betting against digitalization work for kodak, blockbuster, sears, yellow pages, news papers, taxis, postal service, libraries, travel agents, etc? It’s the most obvious trade in history https://t.co/tdJp8XCTjO — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) December 4, 2024 #2 Russia’s Putin Signals Openness To Bitcoin Adding to the momentum, Russian President Vladimir Putin made comments during the Russia Calling forum that many interpret as an endorsement of Bitcoin. “Who can ban Bitcoin? Nobody,” Putin stated. “And who can prohibit the use of other electronic means of payment? Nobody. Because these are new technologies. And no matter what happens to the dollar, these tools will develop one way or another because everyone will strive to reduce costs and increase reliability.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Plunge To Multi-Year Lows: Will BTC Gain From Supply Crunch? The backdrop to Putin’s comments includes speculation about a forthcoming “Bitcoin Space Race” between global superpowers.

He even suggested that part of the US debt could be “paid off” with Bitcoin. David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc and advisor to Trump’s team, emphasized the urgency of this initiative on X: “The Bitcoin Space Race is here. It couldn’t be more clear what’s happening. It must be a national priority to stand up the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the first 100 days of the Trump admin. We need an aggressive plan to grow USA’s proportional ownership of the Bitcoin supply.” It couldn’t be more clear what’s happening. It must be a national priority to stand up the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the first 100 days of the Trump admin. We need an aggressive plan to grow USA’s proportional ownership of the Bitcoin supply. https://t.co/a85wLNoXSS — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) December 4, 2024 #3 Strong Spot Demand And Institutional Interest The surge was underpinned by robust spot market activity and significant institutional participation. During the ascent, open interest in Bitcoin futures skyrocketed by more than $4 billion, according to data by Coinalyze. Funding rates also reached unprecedented levels, surpassing peaks seen two weeks ago when Bitcoin first hit $99,500. Importantly, the rally was driven by spot markets and not only derivative speculation, indicating a healthy and sustained demand. The infamous “Great Sell Wall” at $100,000, which had previously resisted upward movement, was decisively breached on the second attempt.

Notably, MARA Holdings, Inc., the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company by market capitalization, recently raised $850 million through an offering of zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2031. While unconfirmed, there is a strong possibility that MARA utilized these funds to accumulate Bitcoin during the price run-up. Supporting this notion, CryptoQuant reported: “Bitcoin passes $100k as institutional demand drives the market. The Coinbase Premium Index highlights sustained buying pressure from US investors.” #4 Retail Market In Disbelief Despite the bullish momentum, retail traders appear to be in a state of disbelief. On-chain analytics firm Santiment observed that while whale accumulation continues to strengthen, retail sentiment remains cautious. Santiment noted: “With whale accumulation continuing to look strong, the only factor holding back $100K BTC history being made is retail traders’ excitement.” The firm highlighted that the start of December saw increasing skepticism and expectations of a significant price retracement following November’s historic gains. However, the current social media landscape reflects “hesitance and uncertainty from traders,” with a ratio of negative to positive commentary. “With numerous indications over the years that crypto markets move the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations, we should feel encouraged by our fellow traders’ FUD and high profit-taking,” Santiment added. “There may be a bit more of a battle between bulls and bears at this level, but we could see the long-awaited milestone come to fruition very shortly as long as key stakeholders continue their collection of more and more BTC.” At press time, BTC traded at $102,681.

The cryptocurrency beat analyst predictions of an insurmountable sell wall at $100,000 to smash past the level and move to its current $102,964. Market watchers had predicted BTC would cross $100,000 before the end of the year, but the asset has surpassed expectations with this latest milestone. Ethereum (ETH) also registered a significant increase, rising over 6% to $3,800. ETH is trading around $3,850, with buyers eying $4,000 if bullish sentiment persists. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) registered a substantial drop of almost 7% as its stunning rally cools. The drop in price means XRP is now the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with Tether (USDT) back in third. Solana (SOL) also saw its recent rally stall, with the price down almost 2% and trading at $232. Despite these drops, the crypto market cap registered an increase of 0.61% and currently sits at $3.55 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) Dips Due To South Korea Crisis Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from a slight wobble after briefly slipping below $95,000 before rebounding. The dip was triggered by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declaring martial law on Tuesday, plunging the country into a brief crisis. However, it was lifted after a few hours after the opposition-led national assembly passed a resolution to lift it. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Korea Premium Index registered a sharp decline, indicating a significant selloff. However, levels were back to normal once martial law was lifted. Institutional investors saw this as an accumulation opportunity, as shown in Bitcoin spot ETF data. Data from CryptoQuant also shows that 19,500 BTC was withdrawn from Coinbase, indicating investors are capitalizing on the smallest dips in price. Trump Nominates Paul Atkins As SEC Chair President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as Securities and Exchange Commission Chair. According to Trump, Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and the CEO of Patomak Partners, was a proven leader for common sense regulations. Atkins has also been a vocal opponent of the SEC’s enforcement approach to regulatory compliance. “He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.” The SEC is currently led by Gary Gensler, who intends to step down on the day of Trump’s inauguration. Trump had promised to fire Gensler on his first day in office and make the US the crypto capital of the world. He also pledged to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Crypto Liquidations Hit $588 Million The crypto market experienced a wave of liquidations totaling almost $600 million. XRP led the liquidation wave with over $69 million, followed by Bitcoin (BTC), which registered $60 million, and Ethereum (ETH) with almost $58 million. XRP fell significantly after surging to a seven-year high, causing several traders hoping for the price to surge to $3 to lose positions. Dogecoin (DOGE) also registered a decline, leading to further liquidations. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance saw the most liquidations, with $222 million wiped out, 63% of which were from long positions. OKX and Bybit also witnessed considerable liquidations, with $134 million and $124 million. Binance, WazriX Owe Significant Sums In Taxes To Indian Government The Indian government has detected substantial amounts of unpaid goods and service tax (GST) payments by Binance and WazirX. According to India’s Minister of State for Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, the government discovered around $97 million in unpaid GST dues by several prominent exchanges operating in the country. The government has already recovered $14 million in taxes, penalties, and interest as part of an ongoing crackdown. According to Chaudhary, 17 crypto firms, including WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber were found to have evaded GST dues. While most firms have paid the penalties due, some, including Binance, have yet to settle their dues with the tax authorities. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has done it! The world’s largest cryptocurrency shot past the hugely significant $100,000 mark, buoyed by the news that the next Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Paul Atkins, holds favorable views about the crypto industry. Trump announced Atkins as his pick for SEC Chair, with markets expecting a smoother and friendlier regulatory environment under the former SEC Commissioner. With BTC setting a new all-time high above $100,000, the cryptocurrency’s value has more than doubled this year, up almost 45% over the past few weeks since Trump’s election victory. Mike Novogratz, the founder and CEO of crypto firm Galaxy Digital, stated, “We're witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream. This momentum is fueled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenization and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.” The milestone comes after 16 years as BTC stands on the brink of mainstream acceptance despite several prominent detractors and a history of controversy. Hong Kong-based crypto analyst Justin D’Anethan stated, “Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is more than just a milestone; it's a testament to shifting tides in finance, technology, and geopolitics. The figure not long ago dismissed as fantasy stands as a reality.” BTC fell to a low of $90,708 last Tuesday as sellers threatened to overwhelm buyers. However, it recovered to register an increase of 4.32% to go above $95,000 and settle at $95,883. BTC recorded a marginal decline on Thursday before resuming its upward trajectory, registering an increase of almost 2% on Friday and settling at $97,374.

Sentiment changed on Wednesday as BTC recovered to register an increase of almost 3% and settle at $98,581. BTC has rallied during the current session as it broke past the $100,000 mark, with the price currently at $103,034, with buyers firmly in control. With BTC continuing to push higher, buyers will look to surpass $105,000 during the current session. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) overcame considerable volatility and selling pressure at the beginning of last week to recover from a low of $3,255. ETH rallied on Wednesday to register an increase of almost 10% to go above $3,500 and settle at $3,657. However, buyers lost momentum as sellers took over on Thursday, driving ETH down by 2.09% to $3,580. The price recovered on Friday as ETH registered a marginal increase before rising by over 3% on Saturday to go above $3,700 and settle at $3,705. ETH faced considerable selling pressure at this level and as a result, could only register a marginal increase on Sunday to end the weekend at $3,710. Source: TradingView Buyers lost momentum as the week began on a bearish note, with ETH dropping almost 2% to a low of $3,559 before recovering and settling at $3,645. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH fell to an intraday low of $3,504. However, buyers prevented a further decline as ETH recovered from this level to reclaim $3,600 and settle at $3,618. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as ETH rallied over 6% to go above the resistance at $3,700 and settle at $3,844. The current session sees ETH marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to take control. If buyers retain control, ETH could surge towards $4,000. On the other hand, if sellers retake control, ETH could drop toward $3,500 or lower, signaling that markets have rejected the breakout. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is looking to recover after dropping below the 20-day SMA earlier in the week. SOL registered a substantial increase after declining to a low of $222 last week. It rebounded from this level to register an increase of almost 5% on Wednesday and settled at $242. However, with volatility dominating the market, SOL fell back in the red on Thursday, dropping nearly 2% to $237. The price recovered on Friday, registering an increase of 2.41% and settling at $243. Despite a strong showing on Friday, SOL was back in the red on Saturday, dropping 2.33% to $237. Sunday saw a marginal decline as buyers prevented a drop below the 20-day SMA, with the price remaining at $237. Source: TradingView However, selling pressure intensified significantly on Monday as SOL plummeted almost 5% to go below the 20-day SMA and settle at $225. Sellers drove SOL to an intraday low of $215 on Tuesday as selling pressure persisted. Despite considerable selling pressure, SOL recovered from this level, rising almost 4% and settling at $234. However, it could not go above the 20-day SMA. SOL fell back in the red on Wednesday after buyers failed to sustain a move past the 20-day SMA. SOL reached an intraday high of $241 but lost momentum and fell to a low of $224 before settling at $229. The current session sees SOL up by 1% as buyers look to move past the 20-day SMA. A break above this level could see SOL rise to $250. On the other hand, if sellers retake control and drive SOL below $220, it could drop as low as $200. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) registered a significant rally on Monday but has dropped since as sellers look to lower the price. LINK has registered substantial gains since the US elections, with its latest rally beginning last week as it recovered from a low of $16.19, registering a significant increase to settle at $18.68 on Wednesday. However, with LINK facing considerable resistance at upper levels, the price fell back on Thursday, dropping almost 4% to slip below $18 and settle at $17.94.

Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) fell towards the end of the previous week after registering a staggering increase of almost 25% last Wednesday. The price fell on Thursday as buyers lost momentum, and UNI registered a drop of nearly 6% to $12.78. Sellers retained control on Friday as the price fell by 1.51% to $12.58.

Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) is struggling to build momentum and go above $700, with sellers weighing the price down. TAO embarked on a strong rally on November 22 as it rebounded from the 20-day SMA. By the beginning of the previous week, it had gone above the 20 and 50-day SMAs as buyers seized the initiative. TAO rallied to an intraday high of $721 last Wednesday but lost momentum, allowing sellers to drive the price down to $561.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/robot-musk-muskrobo-solana-memecoin-to-surge-14000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37247207,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51410,1733389383,Forbes Highlights XRP Momentum Amid ETF Push and Legal Developments,"A recent Forbes report has shed light on the growing momentum behind XRP, as the cryptocurrency experiences unprecedented gains and prepares to rival Bitcoin and Ethereum. The report highlighted how regulatory shifts, market enthusiasm, and Wall Street’s interest in XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) set the stage for 2025 to be a transformative year for Ripple and XRP. XRP’s Resurgence in the Market XRP’s price surged by over 400% over the last month, positioning it as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This rally comes after a prolonged period of stagnation due to Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The digital asset’s price peaked at $2.86, its highest price since 2018, and the community is excited about its next steps. The cryptocurrency’s resurgence aligns with broader market trends, including the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs launched earlier this year. These ETFs have driven institutional investment and liquidity, and Bitcoin’s ETFs helped it reach a new all-time high in March. XRP now stands to benefit from similar developments. The Push for an XRP Spot ETF The report noted that prominent financial firms, including WisdomTree, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, have filed applications to launch XRP spot ETFs . If approved, these ETFs would enable investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the asset, a structure that has already proven successful for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The introduction of an XRP ETF could significantly boost its price and adoption. As noted by Forbes, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have become some of the fastest-growing ETFs in U.S. history, and XRP could follow suit. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory Shifts Favoring Ripple Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has been a major barrier to XRP’s growth since 2020, but Forbes suggests the tide may be turning. SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to step down in January 2025 . This development, coupled with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, has fueled speculation that a more crypto-friendly SEC leadership could emerge. The Forbes report highlights that Gensler’s impending departure has already boosted market confidence in Ripple. XRP’s price surged significantly following the announcement, reflecting optimism about the lawsuit’s resolution and its implications for Ripple’s operations. The report noted that Industry experts, including Arthur Azizov, CEO of B2BinPay, have pointed to the improving regulatory landscape as a key driver of XRP’s recent gains. Donald Trump has now nominated Paul Atkins, former SEC Commissioner, for the role of SEC, and this could bode well for XRP and the broader market.

37246124,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107292,1733389263,$496.4 Million in Bitcoin Moved to Spot Exchanges in Just One Hour,"The cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant development as $496.4 million worth of Bitcoin was moved to spot exchanges within just an hour, according to CryptoQuant. The transaction, which totaled 4,812.45 BTC, has sparked discussions among industry analysts and traders regarding its implications for market stability and future price movements. Massive Bitcoin Transfers: Key Details CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain analytics platform, revealed the details of the transaction through its Telegram channel, CryptoQuant Alert. The breakdown of the deposits shows: 3,820 BTC (79%) transferred to Mt. Gox. 825 BTC (17%) deposited to Coinbase Advanced. 116 BTC (2%) sent to Bitstamp. These exchanges, particularly Mt. Gox, are known for their significant trading volumes and custody solutions. CryptoQuant speculated that such substantial deposits might originate from clients using these exchanges’ custody services, raising questions about the source and intent behind the transfer. Market Implications of the BTC Movement The sudden and massive movement of Bitcoin to spot exchanges is often considered a precursor to potential market volatility. Historically, such transactions could signify the following: Increased Selling Pressure When large amounts of Bitcoin are moved to exchanges, it often signals that holders may intend to sell. If these deposits translate into sell orders, the market could experience downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Custodial Transfers or Strategic Moves? CryptoQuant hinted that the deposits might be linked to custodial services offered by exchanges like Mt. Gox, Coinbase Advanced, and Bitstamp. This raises the possibility that the transfers were not for immediate selling but could be part of strategic repositioning or institutional activity. Potential Whales at Play The sheer size of the transfer suggests involvement by Bitcoin whales—entities holding significant amounts of the cryptocurrency. Their moves are closely monitored as they can influence market trends dramatically. Spotlight on Mt. Gox The largest chunk of the transfer, 79% (3,820 BTC) , went to Mt. Gox. Once one of the most prominent exchanges, Mt. Gox has a controversial history tied to the infamous 2014 hack that resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC. While the exchange no longer operates in the same capacity, its connection to large Bitcoin holdings remains significant. The recent transfer raises questions: Are these old holdings being repositioned? Could this signal preparations for settlement payouts? What are the broader implications for the market? What Does This Mean for Coinbase Advanced and Bitstamp? The remaining Bitcoin deposits—825 BTC to Coinbase Advanced and 116 BTC to Bitstamp—represent a smaller yet notable fraction of the movement. Both exchanges cater to institutional and advanced retail traders, suggesting potential high-level activity. Analysts are closely monitoring these platforms for further insights into the motivation behind the transfer. Speculations and Community Reactions The crypto community has been abuzz with speculation: Some traders believe this movement indicates upcoming volatility, potentially bearish for Bitcoin prices in the short term. Others suggest that the transfers might align with regulatory or institutional reporting requirements, implying no immediate market impact. Bitcoin Price Reaction: Calm Before the Storm? Interestingly, despite the massive transfer, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable at the time of reporting. However, market experts caution against complacency, as such movements can trigger delayed reactions. Key metrics to watch include: Trading volume spikes Order book depth changes Volatility indicators Historical Context: Large Transfers and Market Movements This is not the first time substantial Bitcoin transfers have made headlines. Past examples show a correlation between significant transactions and subsequent market shifts. For instance: In 2021, whale activity contributed to Bitcoin’s all-time highs. Similarly, large sell-offs in 2018 preceded a prolonged bear market. These historical patterns underscore the importance of monitoring such movements for early signals of market direction. Potential Regulatory Concerns The involvement of high-profile exchanges like Mt. Gox, Coinbase, and Bitstamp in this transfer may attract regulatory scrutiny. Governments and regulatory bodies have intensified their focus on cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. Looking Ahead: What Traders Should Do For traders and investors, the key takeaway from this development is to remain vigilant. Strategies to consider include: Monitoring exchange order books: To detect any significant sell walls forming. Hedging positions: In case of heightened volatility. Staying informed: Tracking further updates from CryptoQuant and other on-chain analytics platforms. Conclusion The transfer of $496.4 million in Bitcoin to spot exchanges has reignited discussions about market stability and the motives behind such massive movements. While the immediate price impact remains muted, the implications of this activity cannot be ignored. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, events like these serve as a reminder of the interconnectedness of large-scale transfers and broader market dynamics.

37246213,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623007,1733389257,"Second Jupuary proposal may pass this week, setting up two major airdrops","The second Jupuary airdrop proposal by Jupiter DEX aggregator seems likely to pass. The voting quickly hit its required minimum, with more supporters in favor of the new proposal. The second Jupuary proposal for Jupiter DEX has a chance of passing, after addressing concerns about the role of long-term holders and stakers. The proposal is still open for voting until December 8, but there are early signs that this version may pass. Voting in favor is so far above 88% , based on JUP deposited for a ‘yes’ vote. If the trend persists, the proposal may pass during the weekend. The previous proposal was declined with a 42% vote against, making the supporters insufficient to achieve a supermajority of at least 70%. Jupuary to favor stakers and real users With two Jupuary events, the Jupiter DEX aggregator will extend the airdrop trend. The new proposal tries to balance the interest of early holders and stakers, while also onboarding new users. To prevent aggressive farming and Sybill attacks, Jupiter will also put in anti-bot protection. The vote puts older whales with significant JUP holdings against potential airdrop farmers. However, the proposal splits the new JUP airdrop with shares for both new community participants, and stakers. Jupiter’s lead developer, @weremeow, also noted the airdrop will target real users, tracking holdings, participation and consistency, to avoid deliberate farming. One of the concerns is that farmers would sell their JUP quickly, depressing the market price. The big change is that the new JUP airdrop will set aside a portion specifically for stakers. In each Jupuary event, the project will airdrop 700M JUP. Some of the allocated tokens will incentivize buying, holding, voting with JUP throughout the year. Unclaimed JUP from this portion will go toward Active Staking Rewards. Stakers will receive a special allocation, with a bonus for a longer history and consistency. The entire proposal is expected to wrap up before January 25, when Jupiter DEX aggregator holds its meeting in Istanbul. The two events aim to speed-run the process for Jupiter DEX, as part of the Checkpoint 2027 roadmap. Jupiter aims to become an everything app with Web3 and trading features, setting up additional milestones for its tech stack and the JUP token. For that reason, @weremeow was keen on organizing two Jupuaries, to avoid delaying additional milestones. Jupiter DEX aggregator will announce new token utilities after the Istanbul event, Catstanbul. The coming years will hold a token audit and a burn, in addition to community discussions on the startup’s usage. JUP expects breakout to a new price level Jupiter is among the few projects with a significant team allocation, which has not behaved as a VC-backed token. Instead, the team and @weremeow are still building up a community of holders, in addition to encouraging content, regular votes, and engagement. At the same time, Jupiter is key for almost all Solana activities, as a tool to find the best DEX trading routes. In the weeks leading up to the Jupuary votes, the JUP token also reawakened. JUP rallied from its usual range around $1 up to $1.30. The token may revisit levels close to its all-time high of $1.85, though others expect a breakout into a new price discovery range. JUP is limited by selling from the DLMM pool, which ensures some price stability on the downside. Once the development pool has completed its goals, the price of JUP may enter a price discovery. In the past, the Jupuary events have been bullish for JUP, due to increasing the project’s popularity. The previous airdrop put JUP into 639,161 addresses, with more than 966M JUP claimed. Nearly 67% of all Jupiter users were eligible to claim the airdrop. Historically, only 7.7% of recipients held their JUP, while the rest retained no balance. The tendency to sell an airdrop remains a concern, though the next two Jupuaries may have a better long-term holding balance. The Jupiter DEX already aggregates its own liquidity near an all-time high of $2.4B. The aggregator also facilitated peak numbers of swaps in the past two months.

The prestigious annual list, unveiled on December 4, featured 14 crypto founders from nine companies, reflecting the sector’s increasing influence and innovation. The lineup includes 10 men and 4 women, showcasing talent from various corners of the crypto ecosystem. Among the most notable entries is Shayne Coplan, the 26-year-old founder of Polymarket, a decentralized betting platform that gained attention for accurately predicting the outcome of the U.S. presidential election despite contrary traditional polling. Coplan’s story also includes a controversial FBI raid , which his platform attributed to political retribution by the outgoing Biden administration. Rising Stars from DEXs and AI Decentralized exchange (DEX) founders were well-represented, signaling the growing importance of DEX platforms in the financial landscape. Ostium Labs co-founders Kaledora Kiernan-Linna and Marco Antonio Ribeiro shared recognition with Sunny Aggarwal and Dev Ojha, the founders of Osmosis. Cindy Leow, co-founder of Drift Labs, also made the list. Notably, the convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology found its spotlight. The trio behind Cortex Labs—Soroush Ghodsi Boushehri, Stefan Stokic, and Jake Sylvestre—were recognized for their AI-capable blockchain innovations. Similarly, Tux Pacific, founder of Entropy, a platform for on-chain AI agents, earned a place among the year’s brightest young minds. Other noteworthy honorees include Omni Network co-founders Austin King and Tyler Tarsi, whose multichain decentralized app protocol is gaining traction. Additionally, Uma Roy of Succinct, focused on zero-knowledge proof programming, and Jason Zhao of Story, an intellectual property tokenization platform, rounded out the crypto cohort. A Consistent Showing Amid a Mixed Legacy This year’s performance matches the crypto industry’s presence in the 2024 list, maintaining a steady influence in the finance category. However, it falls short of the industry’s 2021 peak , when 21 blockchain leaders were recognized, including now-disgraced figures like Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison. Despite the shadow cast by past scandals, the achievements of this year’s young crypto leaders highlight the industry’s resilience and innovation.

37246067,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107294,1733389202,Analysis: Whale Purchases on Binance Drive Bitcoin Above $100K,"The cryptocurrency market reached a significant milestone as Bitcoin surged past the $100,000 mark , driven by major whale activity on Binance and Coinbase. On-chain analyst Crypto Dan revealed in a CryptoQuant report that two key whale purchases were instrumental in propelling Bitcoin to this historic level. These coordinated moves not only underscore the influence of whales on crypto markets but also hint at broader implications for market dynamics, investor sentiment, and future price action. The Role of Whale Purchases in Bitcoin’s Breakout According to Crypto Dan, the breakout above $100,000 was fueled by two critical whale purchases on Binance: The First Purchase: This transaction drove Bitcoin’s price close to $100,000, creating strong bullish momentum. The Second Purchase: This buy pushed Bitcoin beyond the psychological threshold, solidifying its position above six figures. The coordination between whales on Binance and Coinbase was evident, with analysts speculating that these actions were a deliberate attempt to propel Bitcoin to new heights. Binance’s Crucial Role in Bitcoin’s Surge Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, played a pivotal role in this rally. Whale activity on Binance is closely monitored due to its ability to significantly impact market trends. Increased Trading Volume The spike in Bitcoin’s price coincided with an unusual surge in trading volume on Binance, indicating heightened interest from large institutional players and individual whales. Whale Dominance Whales are individuals or entities holding large amounts of Bitcoin. Their transactions can significantly influence price movements, as demonstrated by this historic rally. Coinbase Joins the Action While Binance was the primary stage for this price surge, Coinbase also saw substantial whale activity. Analysts suggest that whales on Coinbase strategically coordinated their actions with those on Binance to maximize the upward momentum. Coordinated Efforts? Crypto Dan posited that the synchronized buying patterns on Binance and Coinbase suggest deliberate planning among whales. Such coordination amplifies the impact on Bitcoin’s price, creating ripples across the market. Implications of Bitcoin’s $100K Breakout The crossing of the $100,000 threshold is more than just a psychological milestone—it has profound implications for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Market Sentiment This breakout has reinvigorated bullish sentiment among retail and institutional investors, potentially ushering in a new wave of capital inflows into the crypto space. Mainstream Adoption Bitcoin’s new high solidifies its position as a viable asset class, encouraging more institutions and individuals to consider crypto investments. Regulatory Implications The rally could draw increased attention from regulators, who may scrutinize whale activities and their impact on market dynamics. Historical Context: Bitcoin’s Journey to $100K Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 is the culmination of years of growth, adoption, and market evolution. Key milestones include: 2010: Bitcoin’s first recorded price was less than $0.01. 2017: Bitcoin surpassed $20,000 for the first time, capturing mainstream attention. 2021: Bitcoin hit $69,000 during a major bull run fueled by institutional adoption. 2024: The $100,000 milestone represents a new era for Bitcoin, driven largely by whale activity and coordinated market efforts. What’s Next for Bitcoin? With Bitcoin breaking past $100,000, the crypto market is at a crossroads. Potential scenarios include: Sustained Bull Run If whales continue to drive demand, Bitcoin could maintain its upward trajectory, with analysts predicting potential highs of $120,000 or more. Market Correction A significant sell-off could follow this rally, particularly if whales decide to take profits. Such corrections are common after major price surges. Increased Institutional Involvement Bitcoin’s new milestone may attract more institutional players, further solidifying its status as a key asset in global financial markets. How Traders Can Prepare For traders and investors, Bitcoin’s latest rally offers opportunities and risks. Key strategies include: Monitoring Whale Activity: Keep an eye on whale transactions on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase for early signals of market trends. Risk Management: Set stop-loss orders to protect against sudden market corrections. Long-Term Holding: Consider the broader adoption potential of Bitcoin and its role in a diversified portfolio. Conclusion The historic rally that pushed Bitcoin above $100,000 highlights the immense power of coordinated whale activity. As Binance and Coinbase whales propelled Bitcoin to new heights, the implications for market sentiment, institutional adoption, and regulatory scrutiny are far-reaching. This milestone underscores Bitcoin’s growing influence in the global financial ecosystem, while also reminding investors of the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets.

Powell discussed US monetary policy, Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies ahead of the December interest rate decision. While markets were expecting the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in December, Powell did not mention whether they would cut interest rates for a third consecutive time. Instead, he signaled a cautious approach to rate cuts. Powell also made important remarks about Bitcoin and said that Bitcoin is a rival to gold rather than the US dollar. Powell made the following statement: “People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset. Like gold. Bitcoin is just like gold – only virtual and digital. People don't use it as a form of payment or store of value. It's too volatile. Bitcoin is not a competitor to the dollar; it is actually a competitor to gold.” When asked if he owned any cryptocurrencies, Powell responded that his position prohibits him from holding such assets. Experts who evaluated Jerome Powell's statements stated that these statements were one of the rare statements in which Powell took a clear stance on Bitcoin's place in the financial system. *This is not investment advice.

37246028,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107299,1733389069,Mt. Gox Moves $2.43 Billion in Bitcoin to Unknown Wallet: What Does It Mean?,"In a remarkable transaction, a presumed Mt. Gox address transferred 24,052 Bitcoin (BTC) , valued at approximately $2.43 billion , to an anonymous wallet about 40 minutes ago, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham. The receiving wallet, identified by its address starting with 1N7jW , has spurred intrigue and speculation across the cryptocurrency community. This monumental transfer is one of the largest single Bitcoin movements in recent months and could have significant implications for the market. Breaking Down the Transaction Blockchain analysis reveals critical details about the transfer: Sender Address: Believed to belong to Mt. Gox, the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange. Recipient Address: An unknown wallet beginning with 1N7jW , with no prior transactions recorded. Transaction Value: 24,052 BTC, worth $2.43 billion at the current market price. This transfer raises questions about the intent behind the movement and its potential impact on the market. Why Is This Transfer Significant? Mt. Gox’s Legacy Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange, became infamous for the 2014 hack that resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC . While much of the stolen Bitcoin remains unrecovered, significant reserves from its pre-hack holdings are under the control of trustees managing creditor repayments. Scale of the Transaction A movement of this magnitude is rare and often associated with institutional activities, regulatory settlements, or strategic repositioning of funds. Speculations Around the Wallet Move The anonymity of the receiving wallet and its lack of transaction history have fueled several theories: Trustee Redistribution: Some believe this could be part of a long-awaited repayment plan for Mt. Gox creditors. Private Transfer: The transfer could be to secure the funds in a safer wallet, potentially in preparation for liquidation. Whale Movement: There’s speculation that the wallet belongs to a major whale or institution acquiring a large Bitcoin position. Market Reactions to the $2.43B Transfer The cryptocurrency market is closely monitoring the situation, as movements of this scale often have a pronounced impact: Price Stability So Far Despite the substantial transfer, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable, signaling no immediate sell-off from the receiving wallet. Trader Caution Investors are wary of potential market volatility should the funds be liquidated. Such a sell-off could put significant downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. What Are the Experts Saying? Trustee Repayment Theories Crypto analysts, including those at Arkham, suggest this movement may be linked to Mt. Gox trustee activities preparing for creditor repayments. This theory aligns with past announcements about partial BTC settlements. No Immediate Sell-Off The lack of immediate trading activity from the receiving wallet indicates the funds might be stored for long-term custody or strategic use rather than a short-term sale. How Does This Compare to Past Bitcoin Movements? This $2.43 billion transfer ranks among the largest Bitcoin transactions in history. Similar movements have included: MicroStrategy Acquisitions: Regular multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin purchases by the business intelligence firm. Whale-to-Wallet Transfers: Periodic large-scale Bitcoin reallocations by major holders for security or trading purposes. Exchange Settlements: Movements related to regulatory penalties or institutional fund transfers. Could This Trigger Regulatory Scrutiny? Large, anonymous Bitcoin transfers often attract the attention of regulators: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Concerns Authorities may investigate the origin and destination of the funds to ensure compliance with AML protocols. Market Manipulation Risks Regulators could also assess whether the movement is linked to activities that might influence Bitcoin’s market price. What This Means for Traders For traders and investors, this transfer underscores the need for vigilance in the crypto market. Key takeaways include: Monitor Wallet Activity: Observing the receiving wallet for any signs of liquidation or redistribution. Prepare for Volatility: The market could react unpredictably to further developments. Focus on Fundamentals: Long-term investors may benefit from staying focused on Bitcoin’s core value propositions rather than reacting to short-term movements. Conclusion The transfer of $2.43 billion worth of Bitcoin from a presumed Mt. Gox address to an unknown wallet has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community. While the purpose of the transfer remains unclear, it highlights the ongoing influence of historical players like Mt. Gox in shaping market dynamics. As the crypto market awaits further developments, investors are reminded of the importance of staying informed and prepared for potential volatility. Whether linked to trustee repayments, institutional strategy, or other motives, this transaction serves as a testament to the scale and complexity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Just hours after its launch, the token’s value dropped by 91%, leaving investors with huge losses. This sudden drop has raised questions about insider trading and market manipulation, putting Welch under scrutiny. Quick Rise & Sudden Fall of HAWK Token When Hawk Tuah (HAWK) made its debut on December 4, it quickly reached a $490 million market cap, thanks to the popularity of influencer Haliey Welch. Known for her viral catchphrase, Welch turned her fame into a merchandise line and a podcast with big names like Mark Cuban. Welch claimed HAWK was “not just a cash grab” and said she wanted to change how people see crypto. Her team promised not to push anyone to buy the token and planned to give free tokens to fans and customers. Welch also said she would keep 10% of the tokens but wouldn’t sell them for a year. However, HAWK’s value dropped sharply within hours of its launch, falling 91% to a market cap of $48 million . The token now trades at just $0.004826, leaving many investors disappointed. Allegations of Insider Trading & Sniping The rapid decline in HAWK’s value was linked to suspicions of insider trading and sniping, a practice where certain entities buy up large portions of a token’s supply at launch. According to data from DexScreener and Bubblemaps , insider wallets and snipers controlled up to 91% of the token’s supply at launch. However, many users accused Welch’s team of market manipulation. In response to these allegations, Welch and her team have denied any wrongdoing. In a recent tweet post, she stated that neither she nor any key opinion leaders (KOLs) were given free tokens.

37245852,https://crypto.news/?p=14316439,1733388776,"Philippine central bank wraps up CBDC trial, sees future in wholesale tokens","The Philippine central bank has completed trials for a wholesale CBDC proof-of-concept designed to enable round-the-clock fund transfers among financial institutions. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has concluded testing for Project Agila, a proof-of-concept for a wholesale central bank digital currency aimed at streamlining interbank payments, the central bank revealed in a press release on Thursday, Dec. 5. The initiative allows financial institutions to transfer funds securely even during non-business hours, including evenings, weekends, and holidays, using distributed ledger technology hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, the press release reads. The pilot tested various aspects of the system, including functionality, performance, security, and programmability, according to the BSP. Unlike retail CBDCs meant for the public use, wholesale CBDCs are issued by central banks for use by commercial banks and financial institutions in high-value transactions, such as interbank payments, securities settlements, and cross-border transactions.

Remolona, Jr. highlighted the potential benefits of wholesale CBDCs, stating they are expected to “enhance liquidity management, reduce settlement risks, and support financial stability.” Although the result of the pilot weren’t disclosed, Remolona added that insights from Project Agila would inform the central bank’s future CBDC roadmap, which seeks to leverage digital technologies to improve the efficiency and resilience of the national payment system. Introduced in March 2022, Project Agila is designed to evaluate the potential of CBDC technology to improve the efficiency and reliability of the Philippines’ large-value payment system. Although the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has not yet committed to adopting a CBDC, the initiative highlights its broader strategy to embrace emerging technologies, aiming to accelerate the digitization of the nation’s financial infrastructure.

On Dec. 4, crypto exchange OKX announced that it had listed pre-market futures for the HYPE/USDT pair, allowing users to speculate on the altcoin’s price before its listing for spot trading on centralized exchanges. Shortly after its listing, HYPE surged to a high of $19.65 on the pre-market futures platform . However, the altcoin was later trading at $13.70, down 14.38% from its all-time high. Pre-market trading delivery contracts are USDT-margined delivery contracts, typically delivered before the new token launches on the spot trading market. However, in this case, the HYPE token had already undergone its Token Generation Event on Nov. 29. Meanwhile, the HYPE token has already been listed on CoinW, a centralized exchange. Following its inclusion on OKX’s pre-market futures platform, the crypto community is speculating that the altcoin may soon secure spot trading support on OKX, which could potentially lead to further price rallies.

Less than a day after the pre-market future listings, Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) price rallied to a new all-time high of $13.14 on Dec. 5.

In a recent post on Dec. 5, Cathie Wood reacted to the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on Bitcoin ( BTC ), describing the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap as a virtual version of gold. Wood stated that ARK Investment Management believes Bitcoin is “a much bigger idea” than gold . She drew comparisons between gold’s value and Bitcoin’s. Gold, a commodity that’s been on the market much longer than Bitcoin, has a market cap that stands at around $15 trillion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market cap just reached $2 trillion. Therefore, she concluded Bitcoin is still in its early stages, and has the potential to surpass gold’s market value. “At $2,700, gold is a $15 trillion market, compared to Bitcoin at only $2 trillion. Even after breaking through $100,000, Bitcoin still is in early innings,” said Wood in her post . Today, Fed Chair Powell described bitcoin as a virtual, digital version of gold. At $2,700, gold is a ~$15 trillion market, compared to bitcoin at only ~$2 trillion. Even after breaking through $100,000, bitcoin still is in early innings. — Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) December 5, 2024 You might also like: Powell says Bitcoin is a competitor for gold, not a dollar Bitcoin recently broke through the $100,000 ceiling after going up 5% in the past 24 hours of trading on Dec. 5, based on data from crypto.news . This is the first time in history Bitcoin’s price has ever gone over $100,000. Bitcoin’s market cap followed suit, rising by 5.74% to a value of $2 trillion. At the time of writing, BTC is currently trading hands at $101,690. Hours before Bitcoin’s monumental jump to $100,000, Fed Chair Jerome Powell publicly dubbed Bitcoin as virtual gold due to how traders have a tendency to use both assets to protect the value of money rather than as a payment option. Thus, he sees Bitcoin as more of a competitor for gold instead of the U.S dollar. Price chart comparing the movements of Bitcoin and gold on the market, December 5, 2024 | Source: TradingView For years, traders have noted how Bitcoin and gold price movements have often gone hand-in-hand, usually with Bitcoin following soon after gold goes up. This is mainly due to both assets’ status as “safe-havens” that protect investors from the volatility of national currencies. When the state of the current economy dips and worldly currencies begin to plummet, investors often turn to assets like gold and Bitcoin because their value is not tied to one specific currency. Another similarity these assets share is their finite supply as both need to be mined, albeit in two completely different ways, before market circulation.

37245716,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107318,1733388593,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Rises to 84, Staying in ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone","The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a key sentiment indicator for the cryptocurrency market, has surged to 84 , marking a six-point increase from the previous day and cementing its position in the “Extreme Greed” zone . Provided by the analytics platform Alternative, the index reflects growing confidence among investors as the crypto market continues to gain momentum. This metric, which ranges from 0 to 100 , is a composite score based on six factors, offering insights into the prevailing emotions that drive market trends. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures market sentiment using a scale from 0 to 100: Extreme Fear (0–24): Reflects high uncertainty and negative sentiment, often indicating undervalued assets. Neutral (25–49): Suggests mixed market sentiment. Greed (50–74): Highlights optimistic market conditions. Extreme Greed (75–100): Indicates euphoric sentiment and potential overvaluation. The current reading of 84 places the market firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone , often associated with bullish momentum but also cautionary signals for potential corrections. Factors Driving the Index to 84 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is calculated using six weighted factors: Volatility (25%) Decreasing market volatility often signals improved investor confidence. The current rally in Bitcoin and altcoins has reduced volatility, contributing to the index’s rise. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) Strong trading volumes and upward momentum in prices indicate increased market activity, further driving the score higher. Social Media (15%) A surge in positive sentiment across platforms like X (formerly Twitter) has amplified bullish market narratives. Surveys (15%) Investor surveys show a growing appetite for risk, aligning with the broader market sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Bitcoin’s dominance remains steady despite rising altcoin interest, suggesting balanced investor allocation. Google Trends (10%) Search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms has risen, reflecting heightened public curiosity and engagement. What Does ‘Extreme Greed’ Indicate? Positive Implications The rise to 84 highlights: Improved Sentiment: Investors are optimistic about short-term market performance. Increased Participation: More retail and institutional investors are entering the market. Upward Price Pressure: Continued buying interest is driving prices higher. Cautionary Signals While “Extreme Greed” reflects bullish conditions, it also serves as a potential warning: Overvaluation Risks: Assets may become overpriced, increasing the likelihood of a correction. FOMO-Driven Decisions: Investors may make impulsive decisions based on fear of missing out (FOMO). Market Context: Recent Crypto Trends Bitcoin and Ethereum Performance Bitcoin recently crossed the $100,000 threshold, with Ethereum following suit at over $6,000. These price surges have bolstered confidence across the market. Altcoin Rally Several altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, further fueling investor enthusiasm and contributing to the “Extreme Greed” sentiment. Institutional Activity Major institutional players are entering the crypto space, adding credibility and liquidity to the market. How Investors Can Use the Fear & Greed Index 1. Timing Market Moves The index can help identify potential entry and exit points: Fear Zones: Often indicate buying opportunities as assets may be undervalued. Greed Zones: Suggest caution, as overvaluation risks are higher. 2. Assessing Market Sentiment Investors can use the index as a sentiment barometer to gauge market confidence and align their strategies accordingly. 3. Risk Management Extreme readings, whether in fear or greed, often signal heightened volatility, underscoring the need for effective risk management. Historical Performance of the Index The Fear & Greed Index has proven to be a reliable indicator of market sentiment. Past instances of “Extreme Greed” have been followed by: Sustained Rallies: During prolonged bull markets. Sharp Corrections: As overbought conditions led to sell-offs. For example, during the 2021 bull run, the index consistently stayed in the “Extreme Greed” zone, coinciding with Bitcoin’s rise to its then-ATH of $69,000. Expert Opinions on the Current Market Sentiment Alternative Analysts Analysts at Alternative note that the rise to 84 reflects a strong bullish narrative but urge caution as markets near overbought territory. CryptoQuant Insights CryptoQuant highlights the need for investors to monitor key metrics like trading volume and whale activity, which could signal shifts in sentiment. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index rising to 84 underscores the growing confidence in the cryptocurrency market, driven by strong price momentum and positive sentiment. While the “Extreme Greed” zone reflects bullish conditions, investors must remain cautious of potential corrections as markets often react unpredictably to euphoric sentiment. By leveraging the insights provided by the index and maintaining a balanced approach, investors can navigate the market effectively during this dynamic phase.

37245734,https://coinpaprika.com/news/putin-backs-bitcoin-russia-embraces-crypto-amid-sanctions,1733388565,Putin Backs Bitcoin: Russia Embraces Crypto Amid Sanctions,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has openly acknowledged Bitcoin’s resilience, stating that it cannot be banned. This marks his most explicit recognition of cryptocurrency’s potential as Russia navigates economic sanctions. Speaking at a forum in Moscow, Putin emphasized Bitcoin's decentralized nature, calling it immune to external control and a leading example of next-generation payment systems. Putin criticized reliance on traditional currencies like the US dollar, highlighting the risks of political confiscation. Following the freezing of $300 billion in Russian reserves by Western countries in 2022 after the Ukraine conflict began, he advocated for shifting reserves into domestic investments rather than foreign holdings. He further stressed the importance of embracing new payment technologies to lower costs and enhance transaction reliability. Russia has introduced major reforms in its cryptocurrency regulations. Crypto transactions are now exempt from value-added tax (VAT), while profits are subject to a capped 15% personal income tax, similar to securities earnings. These changes aim to foster clarity and encourage the use of cryptocurrencies within the country. At the same time, some regions, particularly occupied Ukrainian territories and parts of Siberia, face mining restrictions. Mining in regions like Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson has been banned, while Siberia will implement seasonal restrictions starting December 2024 due to winter electricity shortages. Putin’s government has also taken steps to use cryptocurrencies in foreign trade. A law allowing the use of digital assets for international transactions came into effect in September. However, regulations for cross-border payments are still being finalized, with completion expected by the end of the year. These developments reflect Russia’s growing interest in alternative financial systems, especially amid Western sanctions . In addition, Putin hinted at plans for state-backed cryptocurrency exchanges, signaling Russia’s strategic shift toward leveraging digital currencies. While he supports innovation, the government is tightening its grip on mining in certain areas, balancing its push for crypto adoption with energy concerns. “Who can ban Bitcoin? Nobody. Who can prohibit the use of other electronic payment methods? Nobody. These are new technologies,” Putin declared, underscoring his positive stance on decentralized finance. With Russia actively redefining its crypto policies, it is clear the country is positioning itself as a major player in the global cryptocurrency market.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/putin-backs-bitcoin-russia-embraces-crypto-amid-sanctions,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37245734.jpeg

37245690,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107322,1733388535,"Crypto Exchange Volume Hits New High, Surpassing $10 Trillion in November","In a historic milestone for the cryptocurrency market, centralized exchange (CEX) trading volume exceeded $10 trillion in November, according to a report by CCData cited by Cointelegraph. This marks the first time in history that monthly trading volume has crossed the $10 trillion threshold, showcasing the growing interest and activity in digital assets. The report highlights that trading volumes surged by nearly 100% compared to October , with both the spot and derivatives markets experiencing significant growth. Record-Breaking Numbers: Key Highlights 1. Spot Market Growth Spot trading volumes saw a dramatic rise, reaching $3.4 trillion , an increase of 130% from the previous month. Factors Driving Spot Market Growth : Renewed investor interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum following their price surges to new all-time highs. Increased participation from retail and institutional investors. Higher trading activity in altcoins during the ongoing Altcoin Season. 2. Derivatives Market Expansion The derivatives market recorded a total trading volume of $7 trillion , up 90% from October. Key Drivers : Rising demand for leveraged trading. Institutional hedging strategies using futures and options. The availability of innovative derivative products, such as perpetual contracts and structured options. What’s Behind the Surge in Trading Volumes? 1. Market Recovery and Momentum November’s trading activity was fueled by a bullish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Key events included: Bitcoin Surpassing $100,000 : A major psychological milestone that reignited market enthusiasm. Altcoin Season : A period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin, leading to increased trading activity in smaller-cap tokens. 2. Institutional Participation Large-scale investments by institutional players, particularly through spot ETFs, have contributed significantly to the surge in trading volumes. 3. Increased Global Adoption The growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies across various industries, coupled with regulatory advancements, has boosted trading activity on centralized exchanges. Spot vs. Derivatives: A Comparative Look Metric Spot Market Derivatives Market Volume (Nov. 2024) $3.4 Trillion $7 Trillion Monthly Growth 130% 90% Key Players Binance, Coinbase Binance Futures, Bybit The spot market, driven by direct buying and selling of cryptocurrencies, saw higher percentage growth. However, derivatives remain the dominant segment, accounting for 70% of total trading volume. Centralized Exchanges Lead the Charge The majority of the trading volume increase can be attributed to activity on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken reported record-breaking volumes, reflecting their continued dominance in the market. Binance : Maintained its position as the largest exchange, contributing significantly to both spot and derivatives markets. Coinbase : Benefited from increased U.S. investor participation, particularly in the spot market. Bybit and OKX : Recorded substantial growth in derivatives trading activity. Implications of the $10 Trillion Milestone 1. Market Maturity Crossing $10 trillion in trading volume underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market, attracting both retail and institutional participants. 2. Enhanced Liquidity Higher trading volumes translate to improved liquidity, reducing slippage and making it easier for large investors to enter or exit positions. 3. Increased Scrutiny With record-breaking activity, centralized exchanges may face heightened regulatory scrutiny to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards. Challenges and Risks Ahead While the $10 trillion milestone is a positive development, it also brings challenges: 1. Regulatory Pressure As trading volumes soar, regulators may intensify their oversight of centralized exchanges, potentially impacting operational dynamics. 2. Over-Reliance on Derivatives The derivatives market’s dominance highlights the speculative nature of crypto trading, which could lead to heightened volatility. 3. Security Concerns With more assets flowing through centralized exchanges, the risk of hacks and breaches increases, necessitating enhanced security measures. What’s Next for Crypto Trading? The historic trading volumes in November point to several emerging trends: 1. Continued Institutional Adoption Spot Bitcoin ETFs and increased interest from hedge funds are likely to sustain high trading volumes. 2. Expansion of Derivatives Products Innovative derivatives offerings, such as options on altcoins and structured products, could further boost trading activity. 3. Regulatory Evolution As trading volumes grow, regulatory frameworks will continue to evolve, potentially introducing new compliance requirements for exchanges. Conclusion The crypto market’s $10 trillion trading volume milestone in November is a testament to its expanding role in global finance. With spot and derivatives markets both contributing to this growth, centralized exchanges are leading the charge, showcasing the sector’s potential to attract even greater participation. While the achievement highlights the market’s maturity, it also underscores the need for cautious optimism as regulatory and security challenges loom. The road ahead is both promising and complex, making it essential for participants to stay informed and adapt to the rapidly changing landscape.

Its bullish trajectory remains intact following over 50% gains in a month. Last month’s trading saw Sol through a major break out to a new high of $264 after overcoming tough resistance levels in the preceding months. Buying pressure dropped and the asset lost steam in the late month. That brought a short-notable pullback and the crypto found a temporal support yesterday. It recovered nicely overnight and posted minor gains amidst the latest rallies in the market While providing discounts daily, the price looks good for a short-term buy. But currently, the bulls are yet to show strong commitment. However, looking back from where the price started to rise from $8 in December 2022, Sol has returned a huge profit, though there’s still room for more growth from a long-term perspective. If the $215 level holds well, the price will likely break higher in the next few days. This should put the asset in a more bullish condition until the price reaches a peak. It is now ranked the 6th largest crypto by market cap as Ripple’s XRP overtook Tether’s USDT position. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Anticipating the next leg up, Sol must retake a minor resistance of $248.4 along with the recently suppressed $264.4 resistance. Breaking higher, the $280 level is the next target to keep in mind. Yesterday’s $215 low is still providing support. If it collapses as a result of broader retracement, Sol may navigate $194 and potentially $183.4 for support before climbing back.

Gox Moves Billions After Bitcoin Hits Milestone,"Bitcoin recently hit a major milestone, surpassing the $100,000 mark, which was followed by Mt. Gox moving a massive 24,052 BTC to a new wallet. This transfer, valued in the billions, has sparked widespread speculation about its purpose. Analysts debate whether it’s part of a creditor repayment process or simply an internal reallocation by the defunct crypto exchange. The transaction occurred shortly after Bitcoin’s price reached this psychological barrier. On-chain analytics suggest that the newly created wallet is likely an internal address, as Mt. Gox continues to manage remaining funds across multiple wallets. The exchange still holds a significant amount of Bitcoin , with over 15,000 BTC in its possession. Despite this, the move has raised questions, particularly because it comes after Mt. Gox extended its repayment deadline for creditors to late 2025. Large-scale transactions like this often draw attention due to their potential market impact. Such movements could either signal upcoming repayments or hint at strategic moves behind the scenes. Recent market optimism has been bolstered by several global factors, including positive remarks from key figures and regulatory changes in major economies. This has encouraged greater institutional interest in digital assets and highlighted Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a legitimate financial tool. Bitcoin’s rise above the key milestone could also spark FOMO (fear of missing out) buying among retail investors , further driving its momentum. Experts believe the milestone has symbolic value, signaling a new phase of mainstream acceptance and adoption. Whether Mt.

This also triggered the famous 2022 bear market that slashed the Bitcoin price below $16,000. However, the platform came up with multiple revival plans, including the burn mechanism, which induced confidence within the token. Ever since the start, the LUNC price has been facing bearish heat, which compelled it to drain by over 90%. The Terra Classic price demonstrated a strong comeback with over a 200% upswing and despite the bearish attacks, the token continues to remain within the bullish range, aiming to breach the levels not visited in the past couple of years. The platform is constantly trying to reduce the tokens in circulation by constantly burning the tokens. The latest burn of over 3.1 billion tokens is believed to have ignited the latest price surge. The burning mechanism has whipped out over 390 billion LUNC tokens to date, bringing down the supply to 5.5 trillion from 6.5 trillion. The LUNC price has been rising over 40% since the start of the month and over 120% throughout November. With the bullish market sentiments piling up while the traders becoming optimistic, are there any chances of the LUNC price hitting $1 in the upcoming bull run? The historical price pattern of LUNc suggests the token has triggered a recovery phase and, with a 30% rise, may reach the neckline of the Adam & Eve pattern. The pattern often signals a bullish turn after the completion of the pattern. The price has triggered a strong rise and as the supertrend has turned bullish, the bulls are expected to have a strong grip over the rally. The indicator has shifted from the bearish that it began at the start of the year, signifying the bullish continuation hereafter. Secondly, the on-balance volume remains elevated before the start of the year, suggesting a huge rise in the trader’s attention. Now that the market sentiments have turned bullish, the Terra Classic price is also expected to follow the trend and breakout of the neckline and reach levels above $0.00025. However, after reaching these highs, the price is expected to drop and restest the neckline, followed by a massive breakout beyond $0.0003. If the bulls maintain strength above these levels, then the LUNC price may climb beyond $0.00035, which could lay down a path beyond $0.0004.",POSITIVE,LUNC,ALTCOIN | BTC | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/attention-traders-do-not-miss-the-30-rise-of-this-dwindling-altcoin-in-december-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37245415,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-hits-100k,1733387969,Bitcoin Hits $100K,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) has achieved a historic milestone, surpassing the $100,000 mark for the first time. This remarkable surge is largely attributed to the pro-cryptocurrency stance of President-elect Donald Trump , who has expressed support for digital assets and proposed favorable regulations. The cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $100.000. Market confidence has been bolstered by reports of Trump Media engaging in discussions to acquire the crypto trading platform Bakkt. Additionally, Howard Lutnick, nominated by Trump for commerce secretary, is known for his support of cryptocurrencies, further fueling the rally. The recent initiation of options trading in the iShares Bitcoin Trust , the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, has also contributed to the price surge. Some analysts believe that Bitcoin's achievement of the $100,000 milestone marks the beginning of a transformative era. They suggest that with continued U.S. government support, increasing institutional investment, and the potential for broader adoption by sovereign nations, Bitcoin could reach even greater heights. Analysts view this milestone not just as a financial achievement but as a significant shift in Bitcoin's role within the global economic and political landscape. Bitcoin has faced skepticism throughout its history, with critics predicting its collapse during volatile periods. Phrases like ""Bitcoin is literally worth nothing"" and ""RIP Bitcoin"" highlight doubts about its viability. Yet, this skepticism has driven its evolution, challenging advocates to improve and refine the technology, cementing Bitcoin's place in financial history. The cryptocurrency market has been on an upward trajectory since Trump's election victory, with Bitcoin leading the charge. The anticipation of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the new administration has attracted both retail and institutional investors. China's High Court recognizes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as commodities with ""property attributes"" under law, allowing ownership but banning token fundraising. The ruling reflects China's selective blockchain support for trade while maintaining strict limits on broader crypto use. In summary, Bitcoin's ascent to over $100,000 marks a significant achievement in the cryptocurrency world. The supportive stance of the incoming U.S. administration, coupled with increased institutional interest, has played a pivotal role in this surge. As the market continues to evolve, investors are advised to stay informed and exercise caution.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-hits-100k,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png

This meeting underscores the growing interest from major corporations in cryptocurrency and its broader implications. With Saylor’s strong advocacy for Bitcoin and Microsoft’s influence in the tech world, the collaboration could hint at significant future developments. Wall Street has already reacted. Investors are piling into Microsoft (MSFT) stocks this morning , taking long positions as speculation grows about the potential outcomes of these discussions. This surge reflects the market's confidence in Microsoft’s strategic exploration of Bitcoin, possibly signaling upcoming integrations or new ventures in the blockchain space. Microsoft's interest in Bitcoin comes as no surprise. The company has previously shown curiosity about blockchain technologies, and Saylor, through MicroStrategy, has been one of Bitcoin’s most vocal institutional advocates. Their continued dialogue suggests a serious effort to understand how Bitcoin might fit into Microsoft’s future strategy—whether through payment solutions, data security, or decentralized finance applications. Such meetings between tech giants and Bitcoin advocates illustrate a broader trend: the increasing convergence of the tech and cryptocurrency sectors. If Microsoft incorporates Bitcoin into its business model, it could significantly boost adoption, bringing the cryptocurrency closer to mainstream use. This development highlights Bitcoin’s growing acceptance in corporate boardrooms and its potential to become a key part of global technology strategies. While the specifics of the meeting remain unknown, its implications have already energized the market, suggesting that the partnership between Bitcoin and leading tech companies is only beginning.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/microsoft-and-saylor-explore-bitcoin-potential,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37245410.jpeg

It appears highly bullish on the daily chart due to rising demand in the past few days. Last month was an interesting ride for the bulls as they pushed through several resistances to reclaim the crucial $600 level. After managing to tap the $687 level, BNB fell and ended the month in a consolidation. Pulling back slightly, it retested $615 yesterday and mounted support there. The price bounced back and increased consistently until it broke through $721.8 (previous all-time high) to the new $793.8 high today. Looking at the breakout, which was characterized by engulfing candles, BNB appears strongly bullish on the daily chart with no sign of selling. It saw a rejection and retraced to $771 at the time of writing. Right now, the bears are off the market. While the bulls are fully back in action, bigger price movements can be expected in the long term. A further drop from the current trading level could bring a slight retest of the previous ATH before breaking higher. Technically, the current surge in volatility marks an end to the huge accumulation around the crucial $600 level. A massive explosion lies ahead! BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview BNB just faced rejection at the $793.8 level while targeting $800. Flipping through these mentioned levels, $820 and $850 would be the next levels to watch for an increase. Now that the price is retracing, the closest support level for a retest is $721.8, followed by the $687.7 level. Below it lies the $660 level.

37245293,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389534,1733387758,Is Solana Ready to Break $245 and Reach $270?,"The post Is Solana Ready to Break $245 and Reach $270? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana (SOL) has had quite the ride lately. After a massive 68.29% rally post-US elections, it hit an all-time high (ATH) of $263. But now, at $233.95, it’s sitting about 11% below that peak. So, what’s really going on here? Is it ready for another breakout or is a pullback coming? Solana’s Price Action: Stuck Between $221 and $245 Solana made some waves when it hit that $263 high, but it’s been in a bit of a holding pattern ever since. Right now, it’s bouncing between $221 and $245. The good news? If it breaks above $245, we could see a surge to $270 or even higher. That would be huge, right? The downside? Well, if it drops below $221, things might start to look a little more cautious. In that case, we might see $200 become the next target, and that could stir up some worries. Trading volume’s also down by 12.31%, which could be signaling that people are waiting on the sidelines to see what happens. Mixed Market Sentiment: Optimism vs. Caution Even with the price action being a bit up and down, there’s still some optimism in the air. Many traders are holding onto their positions, betting on Solana’s long-term growth. But the market’s not giving any clear signals. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is sitting at 51.59—basically, it’s neither in the “overbought” nor “oversold” zone. Not a lot of action there. Then there’s the Average Directional Index (ADX) at 21.36. This one’s a little tricky—it means there isn’t a strong direction in the market right now. So, it’s not really clear if Solana’s about to shoot up or head down. On a more interesting note, Solana’s correlation with Bitcoin has dropped to 0.43. This could be good news. It means Solana might start moving more independently from Bitcoin, and that opens up the possibility of its own rallies, separate from BTC’s influence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is Ripple Delaying RLUSD’s Launch?

But, if it slips below $221, we might see it test the $200 support level, and that would likely change the tone of the market.

This surge was fueled primarily by derivatives trading, which accounted for the majority of activity on centralized exchanges. The sharp increase came alongside promising developments in the regulatory environment and growing institutional interest. Donald Trump’s electoral victory sparked optimism for a more crypto-friendly regulatory landscape. This sentiment boosted assets like Ripple, long under regulatory scrutiny, and encouraged significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). CME Bitcoin options volumes hit an all-time high , reaching $5.54 billion—a staggering 152% increase from the previous month. South Korea’s Upbit led the growth among exchanges, reporting a remarkable 358% increase in trading volume. This achievement came despite facing regulatory accusations of over 600,000 Know Your Customer (KYC) violations. The global nature of this growth highlights the increasing popularity of crypto trading outside the U.S. Derivatives trading played a pivotal role in this surge, as institutions showed growing interest in crypto options. The launch of Bitcoin ETF options, approved by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), likely contributed to this momentum. BlackRock saw impressive success with its Bitcoin ETF , surpassing $425 million in trading volume on the first day.

37245172,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656749,1733387452,"Ethereum To $10,000: Analyst Reveals Mid & Long-Term ETH Targets","An analyst has placed these mid-term and long-term targets for Ethereum based on an Ascending Parallel Channel that has been forming in its weekly price. Ethereum Has Been Traveling Inside An Ascending Channel For A While Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed where ETH could be heading next based on a pattern forming in its weekly price chart. The pattern in question is the Ascending Channel from technical analysis, which is a type of Parallel Channel. A Parallel Channel is made up of two parallel trendlines between which the price of the asset consolidates. The upper line of the pattern is created by joining together successive tops, while the lower one connects bottoms. Related Reading: XRP, Bitcoin See Lack Of Euphoria: Why This Is Bullish When the coin is inside the channel, it’s likely to feel resistance at the former level and support at the latter. A break out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. The usual Parallel Channel is also parallel to the time-axis. When it’s not, it’s either an Ascending Channel or a Descending Channel. As their names already suggest, the former involves parallel trendlines that are slopped upwards, while the latter has a decline. This means that these patterns capture consolidations towards the upside and the downside, respectively. Ethereum has been stuck inside one such pattern recently, as the 1-week price chart for the cryptocurrency shared by the analyst highlights. As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum weekly price has been moving inside an Ascending Channel for a couple of years now. The asset retested the lower level of the pattern earlier in the year and successfully found support at it, thanks to which its price has been able to see a sharp bullish rebound. The coin is now about halfway through the channel, which means there is plenty of distance to go before a retest of the upper level. However, the asset can still find resistance here. “If #Ethereum $ETH experiences a pullback, keep an eye on the $3,300 support level — a potential buying opportunity,” notes Martinez. The last time ETH broke past the midway point of the channel was in the first quarter of the year, when the coin went all the way to the upper level. Thus, if Ethereum can overcome this challenge, it’s possible that it may witness a similar rally this time as well.

Qubetics Is Your Ticket As It Sets the Stage for the Next Revolution In Tokenisation,"The cryptocurrency landscape is buzzing with excitement, and if you’ve been keeping an eye on the market, you know that AAVE has been turning heads by revolutionising decentralised finance (DeFi). With its ability to let users lend and borrow without the middleman, AAVE has changed the game. But if you missed the boat on that one, don’t worry! There’s a new player in town: Qubetics ($TICS). If you’re on the hunt for the best crypto to buy this week, Qubetics might just be your ticket to the next big thing in crypto. What makes Qubetics stand out is its focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation. While platforms like AAVE have done wonders for financial services, they haven’t fully addressed the everyday needs of people looking to invest in tangible assets. Qubetics aims to bridge that gap, making it easier for regular folks to invest in real estate, art, and other physical assets. This innovative approach could open doors for many who’ve been sidelined by traditional investment avenues. Let’s dive in and see how Qubetics is setting the stage for a new revolution in tokenisation. Qubetics: The Future of Tokenisation Qubetics is currently in its 11th presale stage, and the excitement is palpable. With over 266 million tokens sold and more than $4.3 million raised, the buzz around $TICS is growing. Right now, the price of $TICS sits at $0.0282, and analysts are optimistic about its future. Predictions suggest that by the end of the presale, we could see the price soar to $0.25, which translates to a staggering 776% return on investment. So, what’s Real World Asset Tokenisation all about? In simple terms, it allows you to convert tangible assets—like property, art, or even small business stakes—into digital tokens. This opens up investment opportunities for people who might not have had access before. Imagine being able to invest in a trendy local café or a budding artist’s work without needing a huge pile of cash. That’s where Qubetics shines. Let’s break it down with a hypothetical scenario. If you decide to invest $5,000 in Qubetics at the current price, you’d acquire about 177,500 $TICS tokens. If the price hits $0.25 at the end of the presale, your investment would soar to $44,375. If you hold onto those tokens and they reach $1 post-presale, that $5,000 could skyrocket to an incredible $177,500. That’s the kind of potential that makes Qubetics one of the best crypto to buy this week. Avalanche Now, let’s shift gears and talk about Avalanche. Known for its fast transaction speeds and scalability, Avalanche has made quite a name for itself in the DeFi realm. With its unique consensus mechanism, Avalanche is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, making it an attractive platform for developers and users alike. Its flexibility has also allowed it to support a range of applications, from DeFi protocols to NFTs. Recently, Avalanche has been making waves with new partnerships and integrations that enhance its ecosystem. For instance, the introduction of Avalanche subnet technology allows developers to create custom blockchains tailored to specific applications. This flexibility has attracted numerous projects, expanding Avalanche’s reach and usability. Analysts expect that as more developers flock to its platform, the value of AVAX, Avalanche’s native token, will continue to rise. However, while Avalanche is doing great things in the DeFi space, it doesn’t focus on the everyday investor looking to dive into tangible asset investments. This is where Qubetics comes into play. While Avalanche secures wealth through efficient transactions and smart contracts, Qubetics could help multiply it by offering real-world investment opportunities. So, if you’re looking for the best crypto to buy this week, consider how Qubetics can complement the robust infrastructure that Avalanche provides by opening up new avenues for diverse investments. Qubetics Applications: Real-World Usage Let’s dive deeper into how Qubetics is set to make a real-world impact. The Real World Asset Tokenisation model offers a fresh perspective on how individuals and businesses can manage assets. It’s not just another crypto project; it’s a platform that empowers people from all walks of life to invest in tangible things that matter. Imagine a small business owner who dreams of expanding their café. Instead of depending on traditional bank loans with sky-high interest rates, they could tokenize their future revenues. By creating digital tokens, they invite investors to buy in, raising the capital needed while allowing everyday folks to invest in a business they believe in. This approach not only empowers the entrepreneur but also creates a community around the business. Let’s also consider artists. Many talented individuals struggle to secure funding for their projects. With Qubetics, an artist could tokenize their artwork, allowing fans to purchase fractional shares. If the artwork appreciates over time, so do the shares. This model not only supports the artist but also builds a community of supporters who are invested in their success. Real estate is another area where Qubetics can shine. Traditionally, investing in property requires significant upfront capital. But with tokenisation, individuals can invest in fractions of real estate, making it accessible to a broader audience. Picture a group of friends who want to invest in a rental property. By tokenising the investment, they each own a portion, making it manageable for everyone involved. These scenarios illustrate how Qubetics is not just another crypto project; it’s a transformative platform designed to empower individuals and businesses alike. By simplifying the investment process and making it accessible, Qubetics positions itself as one of the best crypto to buy this week. The Future for Qubetics Now, let’s talk about what analysts are saying about Qubetics. With the current price of $TICS at $0.0282, projections suggest it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering an impressive 776% ROI. If you invest $5,000 today, your investment could multiply significantly. If the price soars to $1 after the presale, that initial investment could turn into a staggering $177,500! Long-term predictions for $TICS are even more ambitious. Some analysts speculate that $TICS could reach $5 after the presale, which would mean an astounding 3,549% ROI for those who got in early. If you held onto your tokens until they hit $15 after the mainnet launch, your $5,000 investment could potentially skyrocket to an unbelievable $1,125,000! This kind of potential is why Qubetics is generating serious buzz and is touted as one of the best crypto choices in the market right now. As the crypto world continues to evolve, Qubetics seems well-positioned to capture a significant share of the market. Its unique focus on asset tokenisation and its commitment to solving real-world problems make it a standout contender in this ever-crowded landscape. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out! There you have it! If you’ve been eyeing the crypto market and feeling a bit left out, Qubetics offers a fresh opportunity to get in on the action. With its presale going strong and analysts predicting exciting price increases, now’s the time to take a closer look. Don’t let this chance pass you by. Investing in Qubetics could not only change your financial future, but also help you be part of something revolutionary. If you’re serious about finding the best crypto to buy this week, Qubetics is definitely worth your time. Grab your $TICS tokens today and prepare for an incredible journey ahead!

37245110,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622991,1733387245,"Anchorage dropped by bank over crypto ties, CEO tells lawmakers","Anchorage, a federally chartered crypto bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), found itself on the wrong side of its own banking partner. In June 2023, the bank told Anchorage it was severing ties because the company was “in the business of crypto.” Nathan McCauley, Anchorage’s CEO, reportedly shared this during a testimony to Rep. French Hill yesterday, igniting another round of debate about the treatment of crypto businesses under President Biden’s administration. The debanking of Anchorage signals a much larger issue within the U.S. financial system. Industry leaders have dubbed it “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a reference to an Obama-era policy that pushed banks to cut off services to businesses in politically or socially controversial industries. While that operation ended in scandal and lawsuits, the crypto sector says its playbook has returned — with them as the new targets. The ghost of Operation Choke Point Operation Choke Point began in 2013 under the Obama administration, targeting industries that regulators considered high-risk. Payday lenders, firearm dealers, and adult entertainment were among the casualties. By leaning on banks to avoid certain sectors, the government effectively blocked these businesses from accessing financial services, despite their legality. Critics of the program called it a regulatory overreach and accused federal agencies of weaponizing financial infrastructure. The backlash was swift. Congress intervened, lawsuits piled up, and the program was officially shuttered. Or so everyone thought. Operation Choke Point 2.0, as insiders call it, allegedly pressures banks to blacklist cryptocurrency businesses. Anchorage’s case is just one example. Despite being federally chartered and under strict regulatory supervision, the bank still faced rejection from its own banking partner. Marc Andreessen , the tech entrepreneur and investor, brought new attention to the issue last month when he spoke on Joe Rogan’s podcast. “Did you know that 30 tech founders were secretly debanked?” he said. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been one of the loudest voices against what he calls an anti-crypto agenda from Washington. “Un-American,” he declared when describing the Biden administration’s treatment of the industry. Brian argues the government deliberately tried to crush innovation by isolating crypto businesses from financial infrastructure. Sam Kazemian, founder of Frax Finance, also shared that JPMorgan Chase allegedly shut down his accounts tied to crypto without notice. He said it was part of a larger directive from the bank’s leadership to cut ties with crypto-related clients. Gab founder Andrew Torba had an even harsher experience. Multiple banks dropped him, and Torba claimed they acted under regulatory threats. He said banks feared audits and penalties if they continued to serve crypto businesses.

In the clip, he discussed the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple and the broader implications for Ethereum. Atkins, speaking about Gensler’s tenure, noted that Gensler’s approach to cryptocurrency has been anything but lenient, despite initial expectations due to beliefs that he understood the workings of the crypto market. Listen to potential SEC Chairman appointee, Paul Atkins, discuss the @Ripple law suit in this clip from Jan 2022 where he mentions $XRP . Atkins goes on to discuss the SEC’s views on whether Ethereum is a security or not. pic.twitter.com/SRkSKxDwNb — Cowboy.X (@cowboycrypto313) December 3, 2024 Instead, Gensler employed an aggressive enforcement strategy through lawsuits. At the time, Atkins noted that this strategy raised questions about how effectively the SEC can pursue these cases, especially if courts oppose its arguments. The Lawsuit Against Ripple In his remarks, Atkins addressed the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, where the regulator tried to argue that XRP qualifies as a security under U.S. law. He highlighted the broader implications of the case, particularly for cryptocurrency exchanges. He stated that the SEC did not have jurisdiction over an exchange unless it allowed users to trade securities. This way, if the SEC could label cryptocurrencies as securities, it would then go after the crypto exchanges like it went after Ripple. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum’s Status and the Market’s Future The conversation shifted to Ethereum, where Atkins acknowledged uncertainty about its regulatory status at the time. He referenced past remarks from William Hinman , former SEC Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, who argued that ETH may have initially been a security but had since morphed into a non-security. While Hinman’s statements were not binding on the SEC, they reassured the crypto market. However, Atkins noted Gensler’s differing stance, citing his lectures at MIT when he described ETH as a security. This divergence caused uncertainty at the time about how the SEC might proceed under Gensler’s leadership. Atkins noted that the ramifications of declaring ETH to be a security would have been huge. If the SEC were to classify Ethereum as a security, it could trigger legal challenges, including rescission rights for past ETH transactions. Such a development, Atkins warned, could disrupt the market significantly. However, Gensler took a different approach, ignoring Ethereum while aggressively pursuing XRP. This did not sit well with the XRP Army, and many speculated on the reasons for this through the ETH Gate conspiracy . According to most crypto community members, Gensler’s tenure is a failure. Meanwhile, he has announced he will resign on January 20, 2025. This would allow Atkins and the incoming Donald Trump-led administration to properly regulate the nascent industry.

DWF Labs @DWFLabs 在 4 小时前将 200 万枚 $ALGO ($1.17M) 转进了币安。 过去 9 个月里，DWF Labs 一共从 ALGO 基金会的市场运营地址处收到了1.75 亿枚 ALGO，然后转进交易所做市。 ALGO 价格在最近一个月里上涨了 424% ($0.11-$0.58)。 https://t.co/xhXfLmTBr5 本文由 #Bitget ｜ @Bitget_zh 赞助 pic.twitter.com/rUarhVvebJ — 余烬 (@EmberCN) December 3, 2024 ALGO’s price has seen a remarkable surge of 424% over the past month, climbing from $0.11 to $0.58. This significant price movement highlights a growing investor interest in the token and the broader Algorand ecosystem. Further validating this upward momentum, data from IntoTheBlock reveals a dramatic increase in active ALGO addresses. Since December 1, the number of active wallets interacting with the network has spiked by over 300%, signaling a sharp rise in network activity and user engagement.

This growth aligns with broader trends of renewed enthusiasm in blockchain networks focusing on scalability, speed, and environmental sustainability—key selling points of the Algorand platform. As ALGO continues its impressive rally, the role of major market players like DWF Labs and the Algorand Foundation in maintaining liquidity and fostering ecosystem development remains critical. With network activity on the rise and price momentum showing no signs of slowing, Algorand is positioning itself as a strong contender in the ever-competitive blockchain landscape.

Despite on-chain data indicating that Christian has since deposited CRV into Binance, he has publicly stated that he has not sold his tokens. The rally has also reignited discussions around the wrapped versions of CRV, such as $cvxCRV. During the bear market, many investors converted their CRV into these wrapped tokens, which represent long-term staked or locked assets. However, as CRV’s price has surged, these wrapped tokens have exhibited signs of “decoupling.” 2/ 熊市中的幸存者： 许多人在熊市期间将 $CRV 转换成包装代币，例如 $cvxCRV。但在这次价格上涨期间，这些包装代币出现了脱锚现象。有观点认为，这不是“脱锚”，而是长锁期资产与短期热潮的合理定价。 — haowi.eth (@HaowiWang) December 4, 2024 While some attribute this divergence to mispricing, others argue that it reflects the market’s rational differentiation between long-term locked assets and the short-term speculative frenzy driving the current rally. CRV’s price movement highlights a shifting market sentiment and renewed interest in decentralized finance (DeFi). With key stakeholders like Christian holding significant positions and market dynamics evolving, CRV’s future trajectory remains a focal point for investors navigating this volatile yet promising sector. As Curve continues to play a pivotal role in DeFi, the token’s performance could serve as an indicator of broader trends in liquidity management and decentralized exchange growth. For now, CRV’s journey past $1 has reaffirmed its resilience and potential in the rapidly changing crypto landscape. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

These transfers come from an address that received 39.91 million ONDO two months ago from a multi-signature wallet linked to the Flux Finance team. Hayes still holds ONDO tokens valued at $20.43 million, according to on-chain data. ONDO, a token representing the Real World Asset (RWA) concept, has seen a remarkable 72% price increase over the past week, signaling strong market performance. As RWA tokens gain traction for bridging traditional finance and blockchain, ONDO’s growth has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. However, Hayes expressed a contrarian view during this year’s Token2049 conference, suggesting that RWA tokens like ONDO could underperform in certain market conditions. He noted that a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve might spark a bullish trend for Ethereum (ETH). According to Hayes, tokens delivering higher returns than U.S. Treasury bonds, such as ENA, EHT, ETHFI, and PENDLE, are likely to emerge as market leaders, whereas RWA tokens could face challenges. 老黑 Arthur Hayes( @CryptoHayes ) 关联地址过去三小时向 #Gate 和 #Bybit 充值价值 866 万美金的 $ONDO 该地址曾在两个月前收到多签地址转移的 3991 万枚 ONDO（资金来源为 Flux Finance 团队地址），目前他仍持有价值 2043 万美金的代币 ONDO 作为 RWA 概念代表代币，近七天涨了 72%，很猛啊 pic.twitter.com/0E7fbCgThk — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) December 4, 2024 Hayes’ recent token movements have fueled speculation about his market outlook and intentions.

Ethereum's technical indicators, including moving averages and RSI, suggest a strong bullish setup, similar to past successful trades in DOGE and Bitcoin. If Ethereum retests its March high, ETHU could yield a 20% return; if it hits its all-time high, returns could reach 60%. Bitcoin's dominance is declining, suggesting Ethereum may lead the market; I'm planning to hold ETHU through 2024, with potential adjustments if ETH exceeds $4.5k first. Back in July, I initiated coverage of the Volatility Shares' 2x Ether ETF (BATS: ETHU ) with a 'hold' call and a cautious tone. In that piece, my view was that positions in funds like ETHU are not wise for long term investment. This is not what I'd expect to be a controversial view given that even the fund manager warns against using the product for long term investment. Rather, the primary utility of products like ETHU is for short term, tactical trades. Given that, I'm updating coverage of the fund, as I suspect longing ETHU shares will pay off handsomely between now and the end of the year. Fund Details and Objective Details ETHU Inception 6/4/2024 AUM $733.7 million Net Expense Ratio 0.94% Dividend Yield 0.30% Source: Seeking Alpha, as of 12/3/24 At 0.94%, the net expense ratio isn't the cheapest crypto-proxy that traders will find in the market. It's far less expensive to put on a straightforward spot ETF position through the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (NASDAQ: ETHA ) and pay 0.25% without the long term fund decay risk. But the lack of relative risk in something like ETHA is because the short-term reward of ETHA won't be as high as ETHU if the price of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) rises. The objective of the Volatility Shares' 2x Ether ETF is very simple because it's right in the name of the fund; ETHU intends to double the daily return of ETH. Key Risk The key risk in holding leveraged fund shares too long is capital decay. Leveraged funds are highly risky due to the fact that they are generally rebalanced daily. For a 2x long fund like ETHU, the leveraged fund shares can maximize gains very well when the underlying asset being leveraged is in a sustained uptrend. Thus, if these types of funds work as designed, on days when underlying assets increase by 1%, daily rebalanced leveraged funds should increase by 2%. Of course, if traders guess wrong they can lose a lot of capital as a 1% decline in the underlying will produce double the loss through funds like ETHU. Chop is not desired either as it will take only a few weeks for the fund to start under-performing the underlying asset, even to the upside. By taking a trading position in ETHU, one is making a short-term wager that the price of Ethereum will rally over a sustained period of time. I believe we have entered that sustained period for Ethereum. Ethereum's Technical Bull Case Earlier this month, I shared a more fundamental take on why I felt Ethereum was about to get its turn leading the market. Among my rationale, investor sentiment on the coin appears to be shifting if November capital flows are any indication. Furthermore, despite the proliferation of cheaper-to-use, less fragmented blockchain ecosystems, Ethereum is still the boss of DeFi. Beyond fundamentals though, traders often need a favorable technical setup as well before putting on any position, and I think Ethereum's setup is quite good. I generally try to keep my TA very simple. I'm not into Elliot Wave theory and I don't mess with Fibonacci levels. My approach is to simply look at relative strength, moving average trends, and breakouts. When I see the signal I want from all three, I put on the trade. TrendSpider The reason why I like this Ethereum chart so much is because I have all three elements that I want out of a chart. 50, 100, and 200 day moving averages all trending higher with the 50 set to cross the 200 RSI is back out of overbought territory after a strong rally from early November Multi-month resistance (red diagonal line) has been broken out and back-tested These elements were at play in Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) as well when I said that coin was set to run back in late-October. TrendSpider DOGE rallied over 200% following that piece. Ethereum's breakout back-test is nearly identical to the one I shared in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: BITO ) article for Seeking Alpha on November 5th when I said to buy the 'breakout shakeout.' TrendSpider Bitcoin's rally since that article has been over 30% in less than a month. I suspect Ethereum's return will be closer to that of Bitcoin rather than the wildly ridiculous 200% seen in Dogecoin over roughly the same time frame. TrendSpider But even if ETH just retests its March high of $4k per coin, ETHU should return close to 20% from current levels. If ETH tests its all-time high of $4,867 back in November 2021, ETHU should produce close to a 60% return. Closing Thoughts TrendSpider In the last two years, ETH is down about 60% against Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). We've certainly seen this happen before following the 2017 top. ETH's under-performance didn't end until 2020 when the next bull market began. I think we're seeing a similar setup today. Bitcoin dominance appears to be potentially peaking, having hit 60% via CoinMarketCap's measurement in mid-November. That figure is now closer to 53%. We've seen Bitcoin do it. We've seen meme coins do it. Even 'dino coins' have enjoyed a renaissance over the last several weeks. Based on my read on both the technicals and some of the fundamentals, I suspect ETH is going to get its turn leading the market. I'm partially expressing that view through shares of ETHU in addition to my spot ETF exposure and holding the asset directly on chain. I cannot stress enough that this ETHU position is a trade, not a long term investment. Thus, I'm still calling the fund a 'hold' rather than a 'buy.' I expect to keep the position on through the end of 2024. If ETH surpasses $4.5k per coin before that, I'll lighten or take it off entirely.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | ETH,BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742253-ethu-trading-the-volatility-shares-2x-ether-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37244553.jpeg

Gox News: 27,000 BTC Moved as Bitcoin Hits $104K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has soared past the $100,000 mark , reaching $103,403 as of now, a historic achievement for the crypto world. The rally represents a 7.6% surge within 24 hours, fueled by a mix of institutional support, global recognition, and growing regulatory optimism.

Of this, 24,000 BTC was transferred to an unknown address, raising questions about the potential market impact of these activities. As per Arkham Intelligence, the exchange still holds 39,878 BTC, valued at $4.1 billion. However, the payout timeline for creditors has been extended from October 2024 to October 2025 due to ongoing verification processes. While some creditors have received fiat compensation, many are still waiting for payments in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash . Historically, Mt.

The crypto tracker Lookonchain first spotted the unknown address, which moved 2,700 BTC to another wallet on Tuesday. The long-dormant wallet received the trove of BTC in December 2013, when the top crypto asset only cost $625.84. BTC was priced at $95,361 at the time of Tuesday’s transfer, meaning the USD value of the wallet’s holdings skyrocketed by a staggering 15,137.4% in 11 years. Data from BitInfoCharts indicates the long-dormant wallet did receive trace amounts of Bitcoin a handful of times over the last 11 years, though those transactions appear to be the result of dusting attacks. Dusting attacks involve hackers and scammers sending minuscule amounts of cryptocurrency (dust) to numerous personal wallets in an attempt to break the wallet holders’ privacy. The scammers then try to trace the transactional activity of targeted wallets in order to identify the people or companies behind them. Bitcoin is trading at $98,687 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 3% in the past 24 hours and is less than 1% down from its all-time high of $ 99,645, which it set on November 22nd.

Gox Moved Thousands of Bitcoins to a New Wallet!","Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox transferred approximately 24,000 BTC worth approximately $2.4 billion to an unidentified wallet address late Wednesday, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The recipient, an unmarked wallet identified as “1N7jW…1u8Yp,” took 24,051.75 BTC from Mt Gox’s cold storage, marking the first significant transfer from the defunct exchange since November 12. It remains unclear whether the latest transfer is linked to Mt. Gox’s planned repayment to creditors.

Earlier this year, the exchange further extended the wait for creditors seeking compensation by postponing the repayment deadline from October 31, 2024 to October 31, 2025.

37244360,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622980,1733385336,Peter Schiff says Bitcoin hitting $100k happened only because of government intervention,"Bitcoin finally crossed over $100,000 in a performance that has been nothing short of extraordinary after US president-elect Donald Trump shared that he had made up his mind on who he wanted to lead his SEC: The pro-crypto Paul Atkins. The community lost it and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor is even considering throwing a party in Malibu to celebrate. But of course Bitcoin’s breakthrough has made some people really unhappy and bitter. Peter Schiff, stockbroker and proud BTC hater, came up on X to throw cold water at the community’s celebrations. “It’s ironic that Bitcoin only hit $100k by buying off politicians and getting in bed with government,” he said . Peter added that without the government intervention he actually claimed to have foresaw, Bitcoin never would have made it. He attributed the asset’s entire performance this year to politics. In his words: “What couldn’t be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state.” It’s a bitter truth Though his crypto criticisms are always biased, Peter does make a great point here. Let’s be realistic. If Trump wasn’t just silly enough to take the crypto nerds serious, and if the nerds’ own elites didn’t have $100 million and Elon Musk to lobby with, we probably wouldn’t be where we are right now. But let’s also be fair. Everything the industry has managed to do this year (thanks to folks like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, and TRON’s Justin Sun) is just what Wall Street has been doing for literal centuries. Crypto stepped to the field this year, and played their own game better than them. Though stock bros and crypto bros have been on the same side throughout the year so there was never any competition. Trump brought everyone together. So yes, Bitcoin needed the government to intervene for it to hit $100,000 this year. But it’s not just any government. It’s the most pro-crypto White House and Congress in the history of the world led by a man who proudly calls himself “crypto president.” Bitcoin didn’t need a president. It needed a believer, a strong-willed leader that can bring along like-minded believers. And get this, around five years ago, Peter posted, “Keep dreaming. Bitcoin is never going to hit $100,000!” No wonder he’s so mad. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao humorously responded to him two hours ago with an iconic “Don’t dream. Keep building!” Just earlier, New York City Mayor Eric Adams was telling a crowd “Remember y’all laughed at me when I first got my Bitcoin? Who’s laughing now?” It really is a party in the USA. Long Live, Trump! Meanwhile, the crypto president has become an awe to fellow world leaders, citizens, Wall Street , and Crypto Twitter alike. In the beginning of his crypto campaign (and perhaps even up until last month), everyone still had their doubts about his love for the industry. Wouldn’t have been the first, or even tenth time Trump has failed to fulfill campaign promises. We all know that. But the community was also worried because some of his economic policies will quite literally crush crypto, along with the stock market. The president is a very stubborn man. He wants to be in charge of the Federal Reserve , he wants to create a national Bitcoin strategic reserve, he wants to protect USD’s throne, and he wants to slap tariffs on at least five of the world’s most powerful countries. Even with the most basic knowledge of economics, it is easy to understand how these things – combined together, along with a side of Trump – will be impossible to achieve. It’s either Trump gives up his America First agendas for crypto, or vice versa. It’s highly unlikely that he would pick the latter, and with a good reason. Clearly, the man has the toughest job in the world right now. And he reports to office on exactly January 20th. That’s when it’ll start. A revolution, or a spectacular crash. No in-between.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37243701,https://thecoinrise.com/blackrocks-ibit-shatters-records-with-50b-milestone-as-bitcoin-surpasses-100k/,1733384611,BlackRock’s IBIT Shatters Records with $50B Milestone as Bitcoin Surpasses $100K,"BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become the fastest ETF to surpass $50 billion in assets under management (AUM). The milestone, achieved in just 228 days, dwarfs the previous record set by BlackRock’s iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF, which took 1,329 days to reach the same mark. According to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this underscores a seismic shift in Bitcoin’s role within institutional portfolios. The rapid ascent of IBIT is closely tied to a landmark year for Bitcoin itself. The world’s leading cryptocurrency recently breached the $100,000 threshold , peaking at $103,000 and recording a 150% gain in the past 12 months. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Game-Changer for Adoption BlackRock’s IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF, has played a pivotal role in simplifying cryptocurrency investment for traditional investors. Approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year, spot Bitcoin ETFs eliminate the complexities associated with direct crypto trading and custody. Farside Investors reports that IBIT recorded $570.7 million in inflows as of Wednesday’s market close. Analysts from Bitfinex highlighted that fresh demand from new investors has been instrumental in driving Bitcoin’s price to new highs despite ongoing profit-taking. “Strong ETF inflows and institutional buying have outpaced any selling pressure, enabling Bitcoin to maintain its bullish trajectory,” they noted. Pro-Crypto Momentum Adding fuel to IBIT’s momentum is the pro-crypto sentiment accompanying President-elect Donald Trump’s return to office . With anti-crypto SEC chair Gary Gensler stepping down, Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly former SEC commissioner, to lead the regulatory body. Analysts believe Atkins’ leadership could usher in a more collaborative approach to crypto regulation, fostering a favorable environment for further Bitcoin ETF growth. Additionally, Trump has proposed bold initiatives, including a U.S. Bitcoin reserve and protections for domestic crypto mining. Such policies could solidify Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate investment vehicle while elevating the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. As Bitcoin’s narrative evolves from a speculative asset to an institutional mainstay, ETFs like IBIT stand at the forefront , bridging traditional finance with the crypto revolution.

37243585,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373487,1733384507,Total Crypto Market Cap Tops $3.8 Trillion in Record High,"Total crypto market cap has reached an all-time high of $3.83 trillion following a 2.7% rise on the day, according to Coingecko. Digital asset market momentum has largely been driven by Donald Trump’s presidential election victory and the promise of a pro-crypto regulatory landscape in the United States. Since election day on Nov. 5, almost $1.5 trillion has entered the crypto market as total cap has surged a whopping 63% in just one month. Bitcoin Cap Hits $2T The crypto market cap is now up 24% from its previous peak during the 2021 bull market when it topped out at $3.08 trillion. This was 270% higher than the 2017 market cap peak of $830 billion, so a similar gain in this cycle could propel the market cap to around $11 trillion in 2025. Crypto assets have a long way to go since markets currently account for just 21% of the entire gold market cap, which is $17.9 trillion. Today’s record has been driven by Bitcoin, which surged to its own all-time high of just under $104,000 during early trading in Asia on Thursday. As a result, Bitcoin’s dominance has recovered to reclaim 57% following a substantial dip caused by altcoin momentum over the past couple of weeks. Bitcoin market cap has also exceeded $2 trillion for the first time ever, making it the world’s seventh largest asset, just behind Google parent Alphabet with $2.1 trillion capitalization. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor predicted that the Bitcoin market cap would reach a whopping $280 trillion by 2045, which equates to $13 million per coin. “Bitcoin flips Gold market cap 2037. That’s my guess,” said trader Bob Loukas. At the moment, it is just 11% of gold’s market capitalization. Altcoin Market Cap at ATH Ethereum has still failed to reclaim its psychological barrier at $4,000, but it is not far off it. The ETH market cap topped $460 billion as the asset spiked to $3,900 on Thursday morning. Aside from stablecoins, the next largest digital asset by market capitalization is XRP, which has $130 billion and recently flipped Solana, which has $110 billion. Total altcoin market capitalization has also hit a new peak of $1.85 trillion, surpassing its November 2021 peak, according to Coingecko. Remarkably, Ethereum and stablecoins alone comprise 35% of this total.

This prevented the token from breaking down the crucial range and validated the presence of the bulls. Presently, the DOGE price is facing significant bearish action, which may drag the levels lower, offering a good buying range for the bulls and the whales. Since the past few days, the whales have been constantly accumulating tokens and acquiring over 150 million DOGE. Besides, the number of large transactions between $100K and $1M has also surged to a large extent. This indicates that the whales are continuing with the same pattern as they did before by accumulating at the lows at around $0.4. After the price experienced equal pressure on either of the sides, the bears are trying hard to push the token lower. With a drop in the buyer’s strength, will the DOGE price again mark the lows at $0.4? The DOGE price suggests the bulls are relaxing a bit after displaying acute strength in the past few weeks. The Bollinger bands expanded heavily and contracted following a drop in the volume. Currently, the bands are going parallel to each other, suggesting a period of low volatility. The price, which is stuck within a symmetrical triangle, is expected to consolidate within a narrow range, signalling a sideways market trend with limited price movement. On the other hand, the RSI is decremental, forming lower highs and lows, substantiating the descending consolidation. Therefore, the DOGE price is believed to remain consolidated within the pennant for the next 10 days until it reaches the apex of the pattern. Currently, the market participants have shifted their focus back over the top 2 tokens, Bitcoin & Ethereum, and hence, after they book some profits, the liquidity flow could be back over the traditional altcoins. Therefore, the target of $0.55 to $0.6 for the Dogecoin price continues to remain intact, which could be achieved before the end of 2024.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bears-trying-hard-to-drop-dogecoin-to-0-4-but-heres-whats-awaited-for-the-doge-price-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Among the highlights, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana posted notable market cap increases of 112.9%, 34.9%, and 134.3%, respectively. Bitcoin Leads the Pack Bitcoin’s market cap growth of 112.9% underscores its continued dominance as a cornerstone of the crypto market. Its performance far outpaces traditional equities, solidifying its position as a premier digital asset. Ethereum Faces Challenges While Ethereum’s 34.9% YTD growth is significant, it lags behind its peers. This underperformance is largely attributed to declining market dominance amid rising competition from new Layer 2 solutions and alternative blockchains. Even the launch of the US-based Ethereum Spot ETF failed to fully offset this trend. Solana’s Resurgence Solana made an extraordinary recovery following the fallout from FTX’s 2022 collapse. Its market cap surged 134.3%, driven primarily by the 2023 price rally from $15 to $150 during the “meme coin mania.” Emerging Winners – TRON: Benefited from meme coin trends, achieving an 85.5% increase in market cap. – TON: Saw a 136.2% rise, fueled by the popularity of Telegram’s tap-to-earn games utilizing its blockchain. – Sui Network: Topped the list with a staggering 338.2% YTD market cap growth.

In a statement posted on its official X account, the company emphasized that the launch remains pending final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple reiterated its commitment to regulatory compliance, stating: “Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today.

Stay tuned… — Ripple (@Ripple) December 4, 2024 The update comes as the crypto community awaits RLUSD’s release, which has faced a protracted approval process. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously indicated plans to launch the stablecoin months ago , but the timeline was extended due to regulatory considerations. XRP Community Reactions Ripple’s statement elicited varied responses from the community. Some voiced frustration, pointing out the extended timeline for the launch. One user remarked , “It was supposed to launch at the end of Q3, yet here we are at the end of Q4.” Others expressed optimism, with one user commenting , “It’s ok even if it doesn’t launch today. We all know it will launch soon and that will be a huge next step for XRP/Ripple into becoming a dominant market in the crypto world.” Many in the community also thanked Ripple for the update as a large section of the community anticipates the stablecoin’s launch today. The overall sentiment highlights the high expectations surrounding RLUSD and potential to enhance Ripple’s ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 How Does this Affect XRP? The launch of RLUSD is widely seen as a significant development for Ripple’s blockchain infrastructure, the XRP Ledger (XRPL). As RLUSD integrates with the XRPL, it is anticipated to drive increased activity on the network. This, in turn, could boost the utility of XRP, the native digital asset used as a bridge currency for transactions on the platform. Greater adoption of RLUSD and the XRPL would likely enhance liquidity and strengthen Ripple’s position in the digital payments market. Some in the community have proposed that RLUSD could help XRP climb as high as $10,000 . Not everyone shares these lofty targets, but the consensus is that RLUSD’s launch will significantly benefit XRP. The stablecoin’s launch also represents a strategic move to attract institutional users seeking compliant, stable, and efficient solutions for financial operations.

37243385,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389477,1733384050,RNDR Price Jumps 9.29%: Is a Bull Run to $13 on the Horizon?,"The post RNDR Price Jumps 9.29%: Is a Bull Run to $13 on the Horizon? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With a new bull run in the crypto market, the AI tokens are back in action as Bitcoin crosses the $100,000 mark. RENDER has increased by 9.29% among the top-performing AI tokens, reaching a market price of $9.79. As the AI token reaches a market cap of $5 billion, the broader market anticipates a bull run in RNDR price to cross the $13 barrier. Will this ongoing rally result in an extended bull run? Let’s find out. Render Price Analysis The 4-hour chart shows the RNDR price action showcasing a falling channel breakout rally, gaining momentum. After consolidating within the parallel range for most of November, the recent surge of 26% creates a gold candle, breaking the overhead resistance trendline. Tradingview Starting from the 50-day EMA, the bullish candle extended from $8.67 to a closing price of $10.93. Further, the RNDR price surpassing the $10 psychological mark marks the 24-hour high at $11.75. However, the sudden pullback due to the overhead supply and the pullback in the broader market has led to a retest. With an 11.16% drop in the past 4 hours, a red candle retests the broken resistance trendline. Currently, the RNDR price is at $9.70 and teases a post-retest reversal. However, the intensity of the red candle warns of a bullish failure. With the bullish candle, the MACD and signal lines have regained positive alignment, suggesting a potential uptrend if the prices avoid a closing below the $10 psychological barrier. Will RNDR Price Shoot Up Post-Retest? Currently, the RNDR price is within two crucial boundary lines, with $9.30 acting as the nearest support and $11.65 as the immediate resistance. A breakout of either of the price levels will determine the upcoming price trend. In case of a bullish return, around $13.27 and $15 psychological marks are the immediate price targets. In case of closing below the $9.30 support, the 50-day EMA and the 100-day EMA at $8.65 and $8.13 could provide reversal chances. Read More: Render (RNDR) Price Prediction 2024, 2025-2030. FAQs Can RNDR break past $13? If the price holds above $9.30 and sustains its bullish trend, RNDR has a strong chance of breaking past the $13 mark. What is Render’s key support level? Render’s key support level is $9.30. A drop below this level could test the 50-day and 100-day EMAs around $8.65 and $8.13. What is Render’s current price?

37244087,https://invezz.com/?p=2369830,1733383584,"Cryptocurrency market snapshot, Dec 5: BTC hits $100K; CRV, SAND lead surge","The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin (BTC) reaches an all-time high of $100,000 , marking a major milestone. This surge has fueled optimism across the crypto space, with several altcoins seeing significant price jumps. The Sandbox (SAND), and Curve DAO Token (CRV) are among the top gainers, up by 20% and 10% respectively. However, despite the bullish momentum, some major cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB) , and XRP have faced declines. Let’s dive into the key market movements and insights for December 5. Bitcoin price breaks $100K barrier Bitcoin’s price has soared past the $100,000 mark for the first time, setting a new all-time high. As of writing, BTC is trading at $101,750, a 5% increase in the last 24 hours. The surge comes after a period of consolidation, with Bitcoin breaking through the critical $100K resistance. This price jump has helped Bitcoin’s market capitalization surpass $2 trillion for the first time, now sitting at $2.03 trillion. With a 24-hour trading volume of $92 billion, Bitcoin’s dominance in the market remains strong at 55.4%. A significant catalyst for this price rise came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell compared Bitcoin to gold, further fueling bullish sentiment in the market. Bitcoin’s performance is also linked to growing institutional interest, with recent data revealing that Fidelity purchased $17 million worth of BTC ETFs, while $15 million was withdrawn from other ETFs like SoSo Value. Ethereum (ETH) price shows strength Ethereum (ETH), which recently consolidated its position in the market, has seen a 6% increase, trading at $3,855. ETH’s 24-hour low and high were $3,663 and $3,906, respectively. Ethereum’s market cap is now $465 billion, and its trading volume stands at $60 billion. Ethereum’s dominance is at 12.7%, reflecting its continued strength in the altcoin sector. Analysts speculate that Ethereum could see a price surge towards $5,000 if Bitcoin reaches $150K. The altcoin has proven resilient, maintaining solid growth despite Bitcoin’s volatility. Ethereum ETFs also saw an inflow of $43 million, with Fidelity contributing $40 million to the total amount. CRV and SAND Soar Among the top gainers, Curve DAO Token (CRV) has jumped by an impressive 10%, trading at $1.07. The price surge has pushed CRV into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. CRV’s 24-hour low and high were $0.9157 and $1.23, respectively. Meanwhile, The Sandbox (SAND) also experienced a substantial surge, up 16%, with the price reaching $0.86. Its low and high for the past 24 hours were $0.7759 and $1.06. XRP and Solana prices struggle While some cryptocurrencies are experiencing growth, others are facing challenges. XRP has seen a 9% drop, currently trading at $2.3, with a 24-hour low and high of $2.188 and $2.67, respectively. Despite the decline, XRP remains in the top 5 by market cap, with a value of $132 billion. Solana (SOL) is also down by 2%, trading at $235. It has faced a 24-hour low and high of $223 and $240. However, the listing of the Gigachad (GIGA) meme coin on the Solana network sparked some optimism, as GIGA’s price surged following the announcement. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices In the meme coin sector, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are showing bullish momentum . DOGE is up by 6%, trading at $0.4385, while SHIB has surged 4%, reaching $0.00003143. Other meme coins like PEPE gained 5%, though WIF and BONK experienced slight declines. Despite mixed reactions across individual cryptocurrencies, the market is demonstrating overall bullishness. The Fear and Greed Index currently stands at 83, reflecting extreme greed, which indicates high investor confidence and potential for continued growth. However, with some altcoins showing volatility, investors should remain cautious and closely monitor market movements in the coming days.

37243063,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389443,1733383381,"Cardano and Dogecoin Millionaires Bet Big on this RWA Token Ahead of a 50,000% Run","The post Cardano and Dogecoin Millionaires Bet Big on this RWA Token Ahead of a 50,000% Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano and Dogecoin millionaires are making waves again, but this time, their sights are set on something entirely new: PropiChain . This revolutionary real-world asset (RWA) token is projected to soar by 50,000%. With the crypto market brimming with opportunities, seasoned investors are diversifying into this promising altcoin, signaling a shift toward tokens with tangible use cases. But what makes PropiChain so compelling that it’s drawing attention from the top-tier players of the Cardano and Dogecoin communities? Let’s find out. Cardano and Dogecoin: Why Investors Are Exploring New Opportunities Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have long been favourite picks for crypto enthusiasts, but their recent performance has sparked a shift in sentiment among seasoned investors. Cardano, known for its groundbreaking proof-of-stake mechanism, has seen steady growth but is slowing down as its market becomes increasingly saturated. Similarly, Dogecoin, despite its social media following and high-profile endorsements, has struggled to maintain its earlier momentum in a maturing crypto market. Cardano and DOGE have enjoyed impressive runs in the past, making millionaires out of early adopters. However, as these tokens become more mainstream, the explosive growth that characterized their early days is becoming more challenging to replicate. This is where PropiChain comes into play. Experienced investors are shifting their focus to emerging projects with untapped potential. Unlike established tokens, PropiChain offers a fresh opportunity to get in early, with the added allure of real-world utility and tangible benefits. PropiChain is Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization PropiChain is reshaping the real estate investment landscape by bringing in blockchain. Its innovative features make it a compelling choice for investors seeking groundbreaking opportunities. Here are some of them: Tokenized Real Estate and Fractional Ownership PropiChain allows investors to own fractions of high-value properties. PropiChain tokenizes these properties, now allowing investors to start with as little as $0.004 per token. Investors can buy about $1000 worth of shares, depending on how much they want in a property. This allows everyone to diversify their portfolios with stable, real-world assets. AI-Driven Analytics and Smart Contracts PropiChain uses AI to provide data-driven insights, helping investors make informed decisions about property markets and trends. For example, AI might suggest investing in rapidly growing suburban areas before they boom, giving users a strategic advantage. Also, blockchain-powered smart contracts ensure seamless transactions, from ownership transfers to rental income distribution, reducing traditional real estate bottlenecks like middlemen and paperwork. Metaverse Integration The metaverse feature makes PropiChain truly futuristic. Investors can walk through properties virtually before making an investment decision. This feature combines the physical and digital worlds, creating an immersive experience that no traditional platform offers. These high-end features are why seasoned investors, including Cardano and Dogecoin millionaires, are turning to PropiChain. It’s about reimagining how we approach property investment and making money in a tech-driven world. PropiChain’s Presale Provides Early Entry for Massive Returns PropiChain’s presale, starting at $0.004 per token, is on and offers a rare opportunity for early investors to capitalize on its predicted 50,000% run. With a tiered pricing structure, every early entry means greater potential returns. For instance, a $1,000 investment at the current price could yield $500,000 if PropiChain reaches its expected growth by 2025. Compared to Cardano or Dogecoin, whose markets are more mature and have limited upside potential, PropiChain offers a far superior ROI for those who act fast. Early presale participants benefit not only from lower entry prices but also from the momentum PropiChain is building. Conclusion As Cardano and Dogecoin millionaires seek higher returns, PropiChain emerges as the next big opportunity in the crypto space. The ongoing presale at $0.004 offers an unmatched chance for early investors to capitalize on PropiChain’s projected 50,000% rally. The clock is ticking, and the window to secure your massive returns won’t stay open forever. Seize the moment and watch your investment soar with PCHAIN.

This exciting rally has been powered by a combination of positive regulatory developments, growing institutional interest , and global endorsements from major players. Since the elections, Bitcoin has seen a surge above 45% with expectations of crypto-friendly regulations . A Big Boost from the SEC One of the main reasons behind Bitcoin’s surge is the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new chair of the U.S. SEC. Known for his pro-crypto stance, Atkins replaces Gary Gensler, whose strict policies were seen as a hurdle for the crypto industry. Former U.S. President Donald Trump made this announcement, sparking excitement among investors. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and others have called this a win for the industry, hoping Atkins will bring more clarity and fairness to crypto regulations. BlackRock’s Record-Breaking Bitcoin ETF BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (iShares Bitcoin Trust or IBIT) has played a huge role in Bitcoin’s rise. The fund recently reached $50 billion in assets under management in just 228 days—a record-breaking achievement. Investors have been pouring money into the ETF, with over $1.6 billion in inflows just this week. This shows that big institutions are becoming more confident in Bitcoin, further boosting its credibility as a reliable investment. Global Support from Leaders Bitcoin’s acceptance isn’t just limited to institutions—it’s gaining recognition from global leaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently praised Bitcoin during a speech in Moscow, saying it can’t be banned and will continue to grow . Putin highlighted Bitcoin’s ability to lower costs and increase reliability, which adds to its appeal worldwide. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin News: Eleven US States Prepare Strategic BTC Reserve Legislation , A New Milestone for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s market cap has now crossed $2 trillion, putting it close to massive companies like Alphabet and Amazon.

Crypto investors’ fears | Source: Kraken The exchange says the results could suggest that a “large majority of investors are allowing emotional triggers to guide their trades rather than rational strategy,” adding further that these feelings “typically arise from misunderstandings or a lack of confidence in the future potential of a particular cryptocurrency.” The findings suggest FOMO frequently leads investors to chase price surges, with 60% citing fear of missing out on potential profits as their primary concern. Comparatively, only 17% feared missing price dips for potential bargains. “Interestingly, 63% of crypto holders acknowledged that emotional decisions have had a significant negative impact on their overall crypto portfolio.” Kraken You might also like: Justin Sun pledges to create $1b fund to ‘combat FUD’ after facing $280m in losses For many investors, social media appears to blur the line between market insights and emotional triggers.

37245787,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316589,1733383150,"Mt. Gox Transfers $2.4 Billion in Bitcoin to Unknown Address Amid Surge to $100,000","A wallet tied to the now-defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox moved 27,871 Bitcoin—valued at approximately $2.8 billion—on December 4, with over $2.4 billion worth of Bitcoin transferred to an unidentified address. The move coincided with Bitcoin’s unprecedented surge past the $100,000 mark, a historic milestone for the cryptocurrency. The Mt. Gox wallet still holds roughly 39,878 Bitcoin, valued at around $4.1 billion, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. Mt. Gox Transfers Bitcoin Between Wallets The latest transfer follows another substantial transaction of 2,500 Bitcoin ($222 million) on November 12 to an undisclosed address. These transfers occur against the backdrop of Mt. Gox’s extended repayment deadline, now pushed to October 31, 2025. The extension was attributed to ongoing verification processes for claimants. While some creditors have received fiat payments, many are still awaiting full reimbursement in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. Historically, Bitcoin market prices have reacted to Mt. Gox-related wallet activities, but recent movements appear to have had little immediate impact. Nonetheless, market watchers remain concerned that a large-scale distribution of compensation to creditors could exert downward pressure if recipients decide to sell their Bitcoin holdings. As of now, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $103,000, marking a 4% increase in 24 hours. The leading cryptocurrency first surged above 100,000 earlier on December 4, pushing its market capitalization to an impressive $2 trillion. The surge follows a series of developments in the U.S. crypto landscape. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently described Bitcoin as a competitor to gold, while president-elect Donald Trump nominated pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts believe these moves signal a regulatory pivot under the incoming administration, fostering a more favorable environment for the crypto industry. Institutional Demand Drives Bitcoin’s Rally Institutional demand continues to drive Bitcoin’s ascent. The approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January played a transformative role, providing a regulated channel for institutional investment. As of December 3, these ETFs collectively hold over 1 million BTC, rivaling Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated holdings. Additionally, over 87% of institutional investors plan to allocate resources to digital assets in 2024, underscoring the sector’s growing appeal. Corporate adoption also bolsters Bitcoin’s standing, with U.S. companies increasingly using it as a treasury reserve asset—a trend spearheaded by MicroStrategy and gaining broader traction. According to SoSoValue data , Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $557 million on December 4. Among the key players, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF recorded the highest net inflow of $572 million, boosting its historical total to $33.341 billion. In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC experienced a net outflow of $94.31 million, raising its cumulative net outflow to $20.643 billion. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF BTC reported a net inflow of $55.71 million, bringing its historical total net inflow to $785 million. At the time of publication, the combined net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs stands at $108.232 billion, representing 5.54% of the total Bitcoin market cap. The historical cumulative net inflow for Bitcoin spot ETFs has reached $32.291 billion. The post Mt.

37242891,https://crypto.news/?p=14316403,1733383134,Here’s how Ethereum is getting ready for the $4k mark,"Ethereum, the leading altcoin, has been showing positive signs over the last week after months of bearish consolidations. Ethereum ( ETH ) is up 4% in the past 24 hours and is trading around $3,840 at the time of writing. The king altcoin hit a six-month high of $3,900 on the back of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) rally above the $100,000 threshold early Thursday. Source: crypto.news At this point, Ethereum is 21% away from its all-time high of $4,891 in November 2021. The second-largest cryptocurrency reached a market cap of $463 billion as its daily trading volume increased by 46% to $63 billion. What’s driving the ETH rally? There are many factors driving Ethereum upwards, creating strong buying pressure. Most notably, the U.S.-based spot ETH exchange-traded funds recorded eight days of consistent inflows. According to data provided by Farside Investors, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a net inflow of $882.3 million since Nov. 22, mostly coming from BlackRock’s ETHA fund. This brought the total inflows into these investment products to $901.3 million despite a $3.4 billion outflow from Grayscale’s ETHE fund.

ETH exchange net flow | Source: IntoTheBlock The on-chain movement suggests that investors have been accumulating the asset. Considering that 74% of Ethereum holders have held onto their assets for over a year, per ITB data, the leading altcoin could potentially see declining selling pressure. Data from ITB shows that whale transactions consisting of at least $100,000 worth of ETH reached $73 billion over the last week. Growing whale activity usually triggers signs of FOMO (fear of missing out) among retail investors, consequently increasing buying pressure due to greedy market conditions. Furthermore, Ethereum’s decentralized finance sector has also been growing at a strong pace. Per a crypto.news report Wednesday, Ethereum’s DeFi total value locked reached $72.9 billion as the total TVL touched a 31-month high of $134.7 billion. Despite the price hike to June highs, Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index is still hovering within the neutral zone, currently sitting at 63. This suggests a maturing accumulation phase for the leading altcoin, following the path of the digital gold. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

37242885,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389424,1733383079,"APAC Leads Crypto Charge: Digital Asset Adoption Hits Triple the Global Average, New Report Reveals!","The post APAC Leads Crypto Charge: Digital Asset Adoption Hits Triple the Global Average, New Report Reveals! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Asia-Pacific region (APAC) is experiencing a big change in how people handle, with cryptocurrencies taking center stage. From financial hubs like Hong Kong and Singapore to emerging markets in Southeast Asia, the adoption of digital assets is creating waves. In APAC, crypto isn’t just about making money—it’s becoming a part of everyday life, driven by people and culture, not just tech hubs. Crypto Adoption Surges Across APAC A report by Consensus titled “ Driven By Demand: The People-Powered Crypto Movement in Asia Pacific” shows that APAC’s crypto adoption has hit 22% in 2024, almost three times the global average of 7.8%. Thailand leads the pack with a remarkable 43% adoption rate, followed by the UAE (37%), India (32%), and the Philippines (31%). Mid-level adopters include South Korea (28%) and Hong Kong SAR (24%), while countries like Japan (12%) and Mainland China (17%) lag. The survey of nearly 4,300 participants across ten APAC countries reveals that over half of the respondents (51%) view digital assets as key to financial inclusion. Moreover, 37% believe crypto offers greater personal financial control without relying on banks. This shows that people in the region are adopting crypto not just to make profits but also because it’s useful in daily life and fits well with their culture. Changing Sentiment Toward Crypto Over the past year, the sentiment around cryptocurrencies in APAC has shifted significantly. With fewer scandals and stronger local activity, trust in the industry has grown. Unlike in some Western regions, where skepticism toward traditional banks drives adoption, APAC users are more focused on crypto’s everyday benefits. Interestingly, only 18% of those surveyed said they distrust banks, showing that people in the region see crypto as a tool for solving real-world problems rather than a reaction to financial systems. Race to Become a Crypto Hub According to the report, 69% of respondents believe clear rules are important for protecting users. Perhaps, regulation alone isn’t the driving force behind adoption. Instead, it complements the strong demand already present in many markets. Countries with higher adoption rates, like Thailand and the UAE, tend to have better regulatory clarity, helping the ecosystem grow further. APAC Leads the Way Michael Lau, Chairman of Consensus Hong Kong, said APAC is setting the pace for the global crypto market. He noted how recent Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals, along with increased institutional investments, are setting the stage for APAC to guide the world toward a more connected financial future. With its unique mix of cultural acceptance, practical usage, and evolving regulations, APAC is shaping not just the future of crypto but also the global financial system.

Gox moves 24,000 BTC following Bitcoin’s $100K milestone","Just as Bitcoin surpassed the highly coveted $100,000 mark, defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox moved roughly $2.47 billion worth of the cryptocurrency to an unknown wallet. According to Arkham Intelligence, a Mt. Gox wallet identified as “1F…RT” transferred over 24,000 BTC to an unknown wallet starting with “1N7j” at 2:45 am UTC on Dec. 5, where the funds currently remain. While the exact reason for moving over $2 billion worth of BTC from the Mt. Gox wallet remains unclear, similar transactions in the past were shortly followed by payouts to creditors. As of now, it is uncertain whether the defunct exchange transferred the funds to a crypto platform or reallocated them within its own wallets. The move has raised concerns of a potential sell-off by Mt. Gox creditors, especially with the $100,000 mark seen as a lucrative target. Interestingly, the price of Bitcoin did not react to the move and was hovering a little over $103,000 after hitting an all-time high of $103,679 hours earlier. You might also like: Bitcoin breaks $100k amid historical bull run However, it must be noted that the Mt. Gox trustees have extended the payout deadline to Oct. 31, 2025, as some creditors still need to complete necessary procedures or have faced various issues despite most having already received primary and early payments. Today’s move marked the first transfer since Nov. 12, when approximately 2.3k Bitcoin worth $205 million was transferred to another unidentified wallet. Those funds remain stationary as well. As of press time, Mt. Gox still holds over 39,000 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $4.12 billion at current prices. Mt. Gox , once the largest Bitcoin exchange, lost approximately 850,000 BTC, valued at $450 million at the time, to theft from its hot wallets.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Southern District of New York, Mashinsky on Tuesday pleaded guilty to one count of committing commodities fraud for misleading customers about Celsius’ profitability and the nature of the investments that the company made. Mashinsky also pleaded guilty to one count of committing securities fraud, which involved illegally manipulating and artificially inflating the price of Celsius’ CEL token. The scheme enabled the 59-year-old to sell his own holdings for a substantial profit, earning him millions in gains. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams says Mashinsky orchestrated one of the biggest frauds in the crypto industry. “He lured ordinary, retail crypto investors into investing billions of dollars in Celsius with false promises that their investments were low-risk. Using catchy slogans like ‘Unbank Yourself,’ Mashinsky promised that Celsius would keep customers’ crypto as safe as money in a bank, but that, unlike a bank, Celsius returned most of the profits from its business back to users. In reality, Celsius was never profitable.” Mashinsky will forfeit over $48 million in proceeds from his schemes as part of the plea deal. Reuters reports he also agreed not to appeal any sentence of 30 years or less. The sentencing is set for April 8th.

CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost recently analyzed this development in a report titled “Bitcoin retails Investor demand is surging” According to the analyst, the 30-day change in retail investor demand has reached its highest point in years, indicating a renewed interest in Bitcoin among smaller investors. This resurgence comes at a time when long-term holders are gradually realizing profits, hinting at a shifting market stance. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Silent Whales: Rising Exchange Inflows Hint at Market’s Next Big Move $100k Now Possible Than Ever? The growing participation of retail investors often serves as a double-edged sword for the market. On one hand, it reflects increased engagement and optimism, which can drive demand higher. On the other hand, historical trends suggest that heightened retail activity frequently coincides with local market tops. Darkfost highlighted that Bitcoin appears to be entering a period of sideways trading, with prices ranging between key resistance and support levels. This phase of consolidation could lead to a temporary decline in retail demand as momentum slows. However, the analyst also suggested that a break above the $100,000 psychological barrier could reignite retail interest, potentially triggering a euphoric phase in the market. Historically, such euphoric phases have been characterized by steep price increases, driven by an influx of both retail and institutional capital. Darfost wrote: Monitoring the interplay between retail and institutional activity during this phase will be crucial, as strong retail participation often signals heightened market optimism, while institutional interest provides the foundation for sustained momentum. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin now appears to be seeing a gradual resume in its price recovery after recent days of slightly to no movement. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up by 1.4% in the past day with a current trading price of $95,713, at the time of writing. This brings BTC to roughly 3.9% decrease away from its all-time high of $99,645 seen in November. Additionally, this price mark has brought BTC market capitalization to $1.89 trillion as of today, with a 24-hour trading volume of $83.5 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin to Enter Final Bull Phase?

Yesterday, as expected, the president-elect announced his plan to appoint renowned cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins as the next chair of the commission. Can Atkins save the crypto industry? A recent X post by pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton indicates that the expectation among crypto enthusiasts over the new chair is extremely high. John Deaton’s Key Reforms for SEC Deaton pointed out the urgent need to bring in certain important reformations in the agency. He demanded the removal of all the officials who supported Gensler’s regulatory crackdown against the crypto industry. He presented it as a necessary step to prove that he is the appropriate replacement to Gensler. Explaining the importance of revamping the entire top leadership of the SEC, he advised Atkins to appoint those who can foster a balanced regulatory environment that supports innovation while protecting investors. Questioning the relevance of a separate crypto unit, he demanded Atkins to replace the crypto unit with a general fraud unit, which handles all types of fraud. He even wanted the next chair to make clear that DeFi and self-custody should not fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. If Paul Atkins doesn’t fire, or at least demote, certain individuals and completely dismantle – that is, do away with – the crypto unit, he’s not the right pick. Period! There’s NO NEED to have a separate crypto unit at the SEC. Have a general fraud unit that goes after all… https://t.co/34uhp2Ha8x — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 4, 2024 Interestingly, many, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, echoed Deaton’s demands, seeking a sensible regulatory approach towards the crypto industry – which has suffered a lot during Gensler’s insensible crackdowns. SEC’s Misconduct in the Debt Box Case Earlier this year, a federal judge sanctioned the US SEC for power abuse, as he found that the agency acted illegally in its attempt to secure a restraining order against Debt Box, a Utah-based crypto company. At least two attorneys, Michael Welsh and Joseph Watkins, had to step down from their posts in the SEC as a consequence of this legal outcome. However, in the X post, Deaton strongly demanded the dismissal of all the officials involved in the Debt Box fiasco on the first day of Atkins as the SEC chair. In conclusion, the SEC stands at a crossroads with Paul Atkins as Chair. Will Deaton’s reform roadmap shape a new era for crypto regulation?

In a Dec. 4 announcement on Truth Social, Trump highlighted Atkins’ extensive experience, stating: “Paul is the CEO and Founder of Patomak Global Partners, a risk management consultancy. As Co-Chairman of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017, he has worked on and studied the digital assets industry.” Trump further praised Atkins’ tenure as SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, saying, “Paul strongly advocated for transparency and protecting investors.” This nomination fulfills Trump’s campaign promise to appoint a pro-crypto leader to the SEC, a commitment he emphasized during his keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee. Outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his aggressive stance against cryptocurrencies, resigned on Nov. 21 after months of industry backlash. Market and Industry Reactions Gensler’s resignation, coupled with the election results, triggered a surge in crypto markets. Analysts predict that altcoin rallies will extend into 2025 as Atkins assumes office on Jan. 20. Following Gensler’s exit announcement, several firms, including Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, filed applications for a Solana ($SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF). Katrina Paglia, Chief Legal Officer at Pantera, stated that SEC lawsuits targeting blockchain projects would likely “quietly go away” under new leadership. Industry Challenges Under Gensler During his tenure, Gensler’s SEC initiated 104 lawsuits against crypto firms from 2021 to 2023, costing the industry $426 million in legal fees.

37241846,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373489,1733381156,Why Is Ripple (XRP) Plunging When Trump Picked Pro-Crypto SEC Chair?,"TL:DR; Led by bitcoin, most of the cryptocurrency market is well in the green today, but this is not the case for Ripple’s native token. This comes in a particularly confusing time as Donald Trump made his choice for a new SEC chair and he is someone with good history with the crypto industry. Pro-SEC Chair at Last? It was roughly four years ago when the US Securities and Exchange Commission initiated its lawsuit against Ripple, alleging the company and two of its top execs of illegally raising $1.3 billion by selling XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Since then, the case has undergone many tribulations and developments, but most have gone well for Ripple, which has secured a few partial wins. The lawsuit was close to its resolution this summer when a US judge ruled that the firm needed to pay $125 million and it would be settled. However, the SEC, still under Chair Gary Gensler, appealed a 2023 verdict, thus extending the case. Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections on November 5, though, changed the complexion of the game as he had promised to fire Gensler on his first day in office. The current SEC Chair didn’t wait to be fired and announced his resignation a few weeks back, which will become official on January 20. All crypto eyes turned back on Trump, expecting a friendlier replacement at the helm of the securities regulator. His nomination is indeed pro-crypto , at least historically – former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. Consequently, XRP should be surging, right? Why Is XRP Dumping? Most of the aforementioned developments, including Trump’s win and Gensler’s resignation, led to massive rallies for Ripple’s native token. The asset shot up from $0.6 a month ago to almost $3 earlier this week, thus skyrocketing by more than 400% within this timeframe. Now, though, XRP has plummeted by 12% on a daily scale, going below $2.3. Moreover, it lost its spot as the third-largest cryptocurrency to Tether as its market cap dropped to $130 billion. The timing is quite confusing, given the positive news coming from the future Trump administration. So far, it seems like the rally was a classic ‘buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news’ event since XRP skyrocketed in anticipation of a big change in the SEC and is dumping once that change comes to fruition.

37241397,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389433,1733380301,"The Truth Behind the Dogecoin Price Rally Will Shock You, Rival Altcoin to Catch Up and Hit $1","The post The Truth Behind the Dogecoin Price Rally Will Shock You, Rival Altcoin to Catch Up and Hit $1 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Dogecoin price movement has been one of the biggest surprises in the crypto space. In what many might find difficult to believe, the Dogecoin price has continuously outperformed Bitcoin (BTC). According to available data on CoinGecko, the price of Dogecoin has increased by over 162% over the past 30 days, while the price of Bitcoin has only appreciated by 33.5% over the same period. This is even more surprising when you consider that BTC hit a historical all-time high of over $99,300 earlier in the month. However, despite all these happenings, prominent crypto market analysts have revealed that an under-the-radar RWA altcoin, PCHAIN, is poised to outperform the Dogecoin price as the broader crypto market continues its bullish trend. Behind the Scenes: Reason Why The Dogecoin Price is Outperforming Bitcoin While public enthusiasm and hype are apparent drivers, some underlying market mechanics are less obvious but equally influential in the Dogecoin price outperforming BTC. Blockchain data reveals that large wallets, often called “whales,” have accumulated Dogecoin in recent months. These substantial buy-ins have created upward price pressure. Additionally, the U.S. president-elect’s creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and Elon Musk’s department headship have influxed retail and institutional investors into DOGE, anticipating a massive rally to $1. PCHAIN: The Altcoin Poised to Outperform the Dogecoin Price and Hit $1 While the Dogecoin price outperformed Bitcoin by over 120% over the last 30 days, top analysts have spotlighted this emerging RWA altcoin, PCHAIN, to outperform DOGE and hit $1 in the coming months. This is an unprecedented occurrence in crypto, where a relatively new token is poised to outpace legendary meme coins like DOGE. PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-based real estate platform. As an RWA altcoin, the token bridges the gap between real estate and the blockchain, digitizing real estate properties on the blockchain. Currently priced at $0.004, PCHAIN hitting the $1 mark means early presale investors will enjoy a potential 24,900% ROI. In contrast, the Dogecoin price rallying from its current price of $0.4014 to $1 can only yield 149% ROI for investors. That is over 24,700% less than what PCHAIN offers its early investors. The Pathway to PCHAIN’s Price Rally from $0.004 to $1 The projection of a 250x price rally for PCHAIN from $0.004 to $ 1 is based on the solid fundamentals of the token and its real-world use case in the real estate sector. This prominent analyst strongly believes the price will surge and outpace the Dogecoin price to $1 in the coming months. At its core, PCHAIN has several factors driving this ambitious forecast to Outperform the Dogecoin price: Growing Market Demand Institutional and retail interest in real estate tokenization has been steadily growing. Real estate is projected to become the largest type of RWA tokenization, a market worth $16 trillion. This RWA altcoin’s early mover advantage in this space positions it as a frontrunner. If it can capture just 0.5% of the $600 trillion global real estate market, the token’s market capitalization will be worth at least $3 trillion. That is more than the combined market capitalization of the entire crypto market. Low Entry Price The entry point is incredibly attractive, with the token currently trading at a fraction of a dollar ($0.004). With as little as $500 investment today, you will have 125,000 PCHAIN tokens. The 24,900% price rally means you could earn a massive $124,500 profit on your initial $500 investment. The Revolutionary Features of PCHAIN’s PropiChain Platform PropiChain incorporated the Metaverse to redefine how real estate properties are explored and traded globally. With immersive 3D technology, investors can conduct virtual tours of properties anywhere in the world. This creates a digital marketplace where global buyers and sellers can engage seamlessly, expanding opportunities for cross-border investments. Additionally, the platform integrates smart contracts to streamline essential processes like executing and renewing lease agreements. These automated functions reduce reliance on traditional intermediaries like leasing agents, cutting transaction costs while delivering a more efficient and transparent experience for property owners. Another standout feature of PropiChain is its RWA tokenization technology, which digitizes real estate assets and facilitates fractional ownership. Instead of purchasing entire properties, investors can now acquire fractions of high-value assets, breaking down financial barriers to entry. This approach democratizes real estate investment, making it more inclusive and accessible to a broader audience. Artificial intelligence is another cornerstone of PropiChain’s innovative platform. AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots provide users 24/7 support and guidance, assist with property management, and offer tailored investment recommendations. Additionally, AI-driven predictive analytics deliver actionable insights into market trends and highlight lucrative opportunities, empowering investors to make informed decisions. Conclusion With PCHAIN poised to outpace the Dogecoin price to $1, analysts say the token could be among the top gainers in the crypto space by Q1 2025. A $1000 investment at this presale stage could yield a massive $249,000 early next year. Its high profit potential is why more investors and retail traders are flocking to the presale. Join the PCHAIN presale now and position yourself for potential life-changing returns. The current price of $0.004 is the lowest ever for the token. If you miss it now, you must buy for $0.011 and $0.023 for the second and third presale rounds. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap and is already garnering the needed visibility and attracting investors. BlockAudit , a leading blockchain security company, has audited the project’s smart contract and found no vulnerability.

37241629,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51399,1733380258,Insider Who Sold His Company to Ripple Confirms XRP Adoption Strategy,"Nietzbux (@nietzbux), a prominent voice in the cryptocurrency community, recently brought attention to two developments that counter common criticisms of Ripple and XRP. These include a detailed explanation by Austin King (0xASK), another well-known figure in the crypto space and co-founder of Omni Network, King shared a detailed post about RippleNet’s functionality and strategy for XRP adoption. He also confirmed growing institutional interest in XRP. These revelations clarify Ripple’s objectives and the increasing role of XRP in the financial ecosystem. Today an insider who sold his company to Ripple confirmed their entire strategy is $XRP adoption AND a the largest crypto institutional broker confirmed XRP buying is being led by institutions. Two FUD topics DESTROYED in a single day, ironically by two men both named Austin. — nietzbux (@nietzbux) December 3, 2024 Austin King on XRP’s Efficiency Austin King, who sold his company to Ripple and later worked there, shared insights into RippleNet’s design and purpose. According to King, RippleNet addresses the inefficiencies of the traditional cross-border payment system, which relies on correspondent banking. In this outdated model, Banks must pre-fund accounts in multiple countries, locking significant capital and driving up costs. Ripple’s system, by contrast, eliminates the need for pre-funded accounts by utilizing XRP as a bridge currency . When a bank initiates an international payment, RippleNet facilitates the purchase of XRP on a local exchange. This XRP is then transferred to an exchange in the recipient’s country, where it is sold for the local fiat currency. Can XRP Sustain Cross-border Payments? Critics often cite XRP’s volatility as a concern. King explained that XRP transactions, completed in seconds, are less exposed to volatility than traditional fiat transfers, which take days to settle. The digital asset’s speed and efficiency make it a compelling solution for reducing costs and increasing accessibility in cross-border payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Confidence in XRP and Interoperability In addition to King’s explanation, recent reports indicate that XRP is being purchased increasingly by institutional investors. Nietzbux highlighted this trend to counter claims that XRP lacks institutional backing, reinforcing its potential as a tool for large-scale financial applications. Nietzbux’s spotlight on these developments helps highlight Ripple’s focused strategy for XRP adoption and its efforts to solve real-world problems. Ripple is positioning XRP as a key asset in modernizing cross-border payments by addressing inefficiencies in the global financial system. Nietzbux also shared that an insider revealed that institutions are leading the XRP accumulation spree in the current market. King noted that RippleNet’s design principles extend beyond payments and broader applications, such as blockchain interoperability. Ripple bought his company because of his interpreter network to bridge blockchains. These advancements and growing institutional interest , signal a bright future for Ripple and XRP.

The Japanese yen strengthened towards 150 per dollar on Thursday, recovering some losses from the previous session, despite dovish remarks from Bank of Japan board member Toyoaki Nakamura. Nakamura expressed concerns about the sustainability of wage growth and noted signs of weakness in the economy, suggesting he may be opposed to a rate hike in December. Traders now await Japanese wage figures on Friday to guide the rates outlook further. China ( SHCOMP ) fell -0.19% to around 3,370 and the Shenzhen Component up 0.3% to 10,636, recovering losses from the previous session. However, concerns over China’s economic challenges and escalating trade tensions with the US kept investors cautious.

The South Korean won ( USD:KRW ) weakened past 1,415 per dollar, hovering near its lowest level in over two years, as cautious sentiment persisted despite a series of government measures to stabilize markets amid political turmoil. On Wednesday, the Bank of Korea pledged liquidity support and expanded repurchase agreements to ease market anxiety after President Yoon's brief martial law, while the financial regulator prepared a 10 trillion won ($7.07 billion) stock stabilization fund. In economic news, South Korea’s economy grew 0.1% in Q3 2024, rebounding from a 0.2% contraction and matching advance estimates, with annual growth at 1.5%. In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended higher, bolstered by a solid performance in the tech sector and encouraging earnings reports from major companies.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-donald-vs-israel-donisra-to-skyrocket-16000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-dogecoin-and-shib-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37240712,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107424,1733379127,This Rising Crypto Star Is Set To Outperform Avalanche and XRP in 2025,"Lunex Network is a rising crypto star with high growth potential and innovative features. With a decentralized exchange that supports over 50,000 assets and a unique revenue-sharing model, Lunex Network seeks to transform crypto trading and asset management. Experts believe it will outperform established players like Avalanche and XRP by 2025. Lunex Network is set to disrupt the blockchain ecosystem by concentrating on privacy, user-friendliness, and scalability. Avalanche (AVAX) Saw An Over 120% Price Increase In November Avalanche has recently shown impressive price performance. Nearly 596,000 AVAX tokens were transferred into the Grayscale Avalanche Trust a few days ago, signaling growing confidence from major investors. This transfer highlights the strong interest of significant market players in Avalanche. The altcoin recorded a 120% gain in November 2024 and has maintained a price above $45 after breaking out of a year-long descending channel. On-chain activity supports this momentum, with active addresses increasing by 28.56% to reach 60,460. The Avalanche9000 upgrade has significantly strengthened the ecosystem. This upgrade reduced deployment costs by 99.9% and unlocked $40 million in grants for developers, enhancing the platform’s appeal to the broader crypto community. All these developments highlight Avalanche’s increasing prominence in the blockchain space. XRP (XRP) Becomes 3rd Largest Crypto By Market Cap XRP recently overtook Tether (USDT) as the third biggest cryptocurrency by market value. By December 1, 2024, XRP had a market cap of $143.8 billion, in comparison with USDT’s $134.5 billion. XRP’s price has jumped 16% to $2.68 in 24 hours and 433% in the past month. XRP also overtook Solana in market cap during the weekend. Ripple’s legal fight with the SEC and the possible approval of its RLUSD stablecoin have fuelled this particular price rise. Sources indicate that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) might approve RLUSD on December 4. This approval would enable Ripple to integrate RLUSD directly into RippleNet, strengthening its cross-border payment system and stabilizing XRP. XRP’s optimism also increased with the SEC leadership change expected shortly. Current SEC chairman Gary Gensler is departing by January 2025 and a more lenient stance toward Ripple is hoped to emerge under a brand new leadership. Some experts think new SEC leadership might result in a settlement or dismissal of the case. XRP remains 27.6% below its all-time high of $3.40 from Jan 2018 despite the latest rally. The latest surge restored investor confidence in XRP although some analysts point out it might be temporary and warn new buyers of the risks. Lunex Network (LNEX) Gives Full Control To The Traders Lunex Network is making waves in DeFi as a hybrid Web3 exchange. Lunex Network brings together the benefits of centralized and decentralized platforms without the typical disadvantages. The platform’s non-custodial structure provides users complete control of the assets, eliminating the security risks of central exchanges.

Lunex Network uses smart contract technology to enable seamless trades. This innovation allows users to quickly swap more than 50,000 assets with some of the lowest fees in the market. The ongoing $LNEX token presale has surged by 200% , drawing early adopters and seasoned traders. Many are eager to benefit from Lunex Network’s potential for high returns and its ambitious roadmap. The crypto market is alive with innovation as projects like Lunex Network, XRP, and Avalanche push boundaries. Lunex Network is leading with its 200% presale growth, while XRP boasts a 345% year-to-date increase, and AVAX is gaining momentum from institutional backing. While XRP and Avalanche may have peaked, Lunex Network’s presale, priced at just $0.0036, remains a hot opportunity.

Adding to the excitement, just 8 hours ago, Sun deposited another 20,000 ETH, valued at $76.3 million, into HTX as Ethereum’s price broke past the $3,800 mark. Motive Behind The Transfer The scale and timing of these transfers have sparked plenty of chatter in the crypto space.

He stated that he likes the SHIB price setup from its current position, and expects the token to breach the $0.00006 price level. According to TSLA Tracker’s analysis, Shiba Inu has been following a clear price pattern, and he believes this trend will continue. The analyst’s accompanying chart suggests that SHIB could surge 132% from the current price to reach $0.00006937, which coincides with the Fibonacci 76.4% level. I like $SHIB a lot from here: pic.twitter.com/tq5XCbP7PT — $TSLA Tracker (@SBZung) December 2, 2024 Is Shiba Inu (SHIB) About to Explode? Shiba Inu has seen a consolidation phase recently after pushing to a multi-month high of $0.000033159 on December 1. Despite a brief correction from that level, the meme coin quickly recovered, and is now trading at $0.000032, up 8% from yesterday. Another notable market analyst, Javon Marks, has expressed a positive outlook on Shiba Inu. Marks revealed that the token had broken out from a prolonged falling wedge pattern, and he expects the bullish momentum to continue and drive it closer to its all-time high. Marks predicted a 360% upswing for SHIB , targeting a price of $0.000081. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The current technical indicators tell a different story. The RSI suggests a continued price increase, currently sitting around 57. This indicates that the token has more room for upside before entering overbought territory. However, the MACD suggests a bearish outlook, as the MACD line widens from the signal line, signaling bearishness. Despite this, the overall sentiment among analysts remains bullish on Shiba Inu, as it swiftly recovered from the recent bearish turn. Additionally, Shiba Inu’s trading volume has increased by 17.5% to $3.43 billion in the past 24 hours, suggesting increased attention for the meme coin. CoinMarketCap data shows that 89% of the community is bullish on the token, and many expect the recent rally to continue. There are many reasons why the community is bullish, and a prominent one is the upcoming SHIB DAO. Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama recently issued a critical warning about the DAO to keep users safe as the launch approaches. At the time of press, SHIB is nearing its highest level since April and is quickly catching up to its 2024 peak of $0.00004534. Reaching TSLA Tracker’s target of $0.00006937 would place it above this level, and the next target would be the meme coin’s all-time high of $0.00008845.

The transfer, which took place on December 5 at 2:45 AM (UTC), was sent to an unknown address with no previous connection to the past Mt. Gox BTC transfers. The address starts with “1N7j,” and the transaction incurred around $3.78 in fees. The defunct exchange had remained dormant since November 12 before the massive move. Since Mt.

Large moves have been considered bearish due to the possibility of more Bitcoin flooding the market in a big sale. Several analysts have discussed what markets should expect during the Mt. Gox repayment plan. Tony Sycamore, an IG Markets analyst, reportedly mentioned in June this year that the moves should not worry the crypto community. Sycamore explained his thoughts, mentioning that the exchange’s repayment was expected for a long time. The analysts further suggested that that time would be a great entry point for investors waiting for ‘better buying levels.’ Alex Thorn, a Galaxy Digital executive, tweeted in June that crypto markets should expect fewer Bitcoin flooding the market. The analyst supported his claims by estimating the exchange’s expected distributions. In his opinion, Thorn explained that the BTC selling pressure would be lower than what the crypto markets were expecting. A July 29 Glassnode report further highlighted that Mt. Gox creditors were not planning to sell their BTC. The on-chain analytics platform explained that only a few of the creditors’ coins would hit the market, significantly reducing the expected selling pressure. The report also highlighted the creditors’ decision to receive payments in BTC instead of fiat. Mt. Gox trustee announces a push in the repayment deadline 🚨 BREAKING: Mt.

Gox trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi announced that the defunct exchange was pushing the repayment deadline to October 31, 2025. The trustee explained in the notice that many creditors must complete the procedures necessary to receive the payments. The trustee further highlighted other reasons, such as issues during the repayment process, which also caused a payment delay for other creditors. In September last year, the exchange changed the repayment deadline to October 31 this year. In a letter, the exchange’s trustee explained that verifying the repayment information provided by creditors would require more time, hence not meeting the October 31, 2023 deadline. In June this year, Mt. Gox later gave a notice that the repayments would begin in July, kicking off the massive transfers.

37240253,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389411,1733378117,Ripple’s RLUSD Faces Approval Hurdle: What to Expect,"The post Ripple’s RLUSD Faces Approval Hurdle: What to Expect appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple had big plans to launch its stablecoin , RLUSD, on December 4. But things didn’t go as expected. The company announced on its X account that they’re holding off until they get approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). While this is frustrating for fans of Ripple, the delay might actually work in their favor. What Makes RLUSD Different? What’s the deal with RLUSD? It’s not just another stablecoin trying to make a splash. The stable coin is designed to be pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. It will be backed by reserves like actual dollars, short term US Treasury securities and cash equivalents. But here’s the kicker: Ripple’s stablecoin is built to work across two major platforms, XRPL and Ethereum. That’s a big deal. It could open doors for Ripple to play a larger role in decentralized finance (DeFi), where stablecoins are already a critical piece of the puzzle. Ripple clearly wants RLUSD to go head-to-head with the market’s big players, like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Earlier this year, Ripple tested RLUSD on Ethereum and its XRP Ledger, and the results seemed promising. Now, they’re waiting to launch it officially—and that means following the rules in one of the toughest regulatory environments, New York. Why the Delay Matters For some people the delay in launch might look like a problem. However, Ripple is very serious about going by the rules. They are waiting for NYDFS approval for their stable coin because they want it to be trusted, not just by crypto people but by institutions as well as regulators. This careful approach might slow them down, but it could also help Ripple stand out in a market where regulatory compliance is often overlooked. And trust is a big deal, especially when it comes to stablecoins. Ripple’s Bigger Picture Ripple isn’t just launching a stablecoin. They are changing how people see the company. For a lot of people, Ripple is only known as the firm behind XRP token. With the launch of RLUSD, they are positioning themselves as a leader in regulated digital finance. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has also been vocal about crypto regulation. He recently supported Paul Atkins for SEC chair, saying the agency needs someone who can bring common sense back to crypto policy. Ripple wants more than just to launch RLUSD—they want to influence how the entire crypto industry grows. What’s Next? Sure, the delay isn’t ideal. But Ripple is playing the long game here. If they get the green light from NYDFS, RLUSD could be a real competitor in the stablecoin market. It’s not just about taking on USDT or USDC. It’s about showing that Ripple can thrive in a regulated world. Ripple’s approach might seem slow, but it’s clear they’re aiming for something bigger. Trust, innovation, and a stablecoin that could shake up the market. The wait might just be worth it.",NEUTRAL,USDT | USDC,ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | USDC,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripples-rlusd-faces-approval-hurdle-what-to-expect/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This marks a 7.62% sell over the past 24 hours. Amid the increased bullish momentum in the crypto market, Ethereum’s price records a 4.18% jump to surpass the $3,800 barrier. Currently, with a market cap of $461 million, the Ethereum price is trading at $3,829. Will this breakout rally result in a new 52-week high for Ethereum? Let’s find out. Ethereum Price Analysis In the 4-hour chart, the Ethereum price action showcases a rising channel pattern containing a bullish trend. Within the channel, the Ethereum price action showcases a breakout of crucial resistance at $3,700. Tradingview With 7 consecutive bullish candle streaks, the Ethereum price surged nearly 9% from the local support trendline and the 50-EMA line. The bullish turnaround started with the Morningstar pattern and peaked at $39.06. However, with the Morningstar reversal, the current 4-hour candle showcases two doji formations. With an extended price range, the candles are retesting the broken supply zone. This increases the possibility of a post-retest bounceback to challenge the overhead resistance trendline. Ethereum Technicals and Price Targets Based on supporting the bullish trend at hand, the MACDs and signal lines have given a positive crossover with a boost in bullish histograms. Furthermore, the positive alignment of the 20-day and 50-day EMA are acting as dynamic support levels. Hence, a bullish trend in Ethereum is likely to surpass its current 52-week high and challenge the overhead resistance trendline near $4100. On the flip side, the crucial resistance-turned-support zone at $3750 will likely absorb any surge in supply pressure. Will the bull run in ETH surpass $5,000? Find out now in Coinpedia’s well-rounded ETH price prediction ! FAQs Can Ethereum hit a new 52-week high? Yes, Ethereum is on track to break its 52-week high. The next target is $4,100, but it faces major resistance there. What is Ethereum’s key support level? The key support level for Ethereum is $3,750. If the price drops, this zone should help hold the bullish trend intact. What is Ethereum’s current price?

37245785,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316572,1733377818,Crypto Founders Dominate Finance Category across Forbes’ 30 Under 30 List for 2025,"The cryptocurrency industry’s rising stars have once again made a strong impression, claiming nearly a third of the coveted spots in Forbes’ “30 Under 30” finance category for 2025. Released on December 4, the annual list recognizes outstanding young business leaders across North America. Among the 30 honorees, 14 founders represented nine crypto and blockchain-related companies, featuring 10 male and four female founders. Polymarket Founder Among the Honorees Among them is Shayne Coplan, the 26-year-old founder of Polymarket, a decentralized betting platform that garnered attention for its innovative markets and bold predictions during the United States presidential election. Polymarket users predicted Donald Trump’s victory even as traditional polls showed a tight race against Kamala Harris. Coplan’s achievements, however, came with challenges, including a reported FBI raid following the election, which Polymarket described as politically motivated retaliation. Several decentralized exchange (DEX) innovators also made the cut. Kaledora Kiernan-Linna and Marco Antonio Ribeiro, co-founders of Ostium Labs, shared a spot with Sunny Aggarwal and Dev Ojha, the duo behind Osmosis. Cindy Leow, co-founder of Drift Labs, further represented the DEX community on the list. Other standout entries include the founding trio of Cortex Labs — Soroush Ghodsi Boushehri, Stefan Stokic, and Jake Sylvestre — who are pioneering artificial intelligence-capable blockchains. Tux Pacific, the founder of Entropy, was also recognized for developing on-chain AI agents. Additionally, Omni Network co-founders Austin King and Tyler Tarsi earned their place for their work on a multichain decentralized app protocol. Jason Zhao of Story and Uma Roy of Succinct were also celebrated for their efforts in intellectual property tokenization and zero-knowledge proof programming, respectively. This year’s showing mirrors that of 2024, when crypto founders also claimed nine spots on the list. However, the industry’s influence has not yet returned to its peak in 2021, when Forbes highlighted 21 blockchain leaders, including prominent figures such as Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison. Both were later embroiled in scandals surrounding Alameda Research and FTX, culminating in Ellison’s imprisonment and Bankman-Fried’s 20-year sentence for fraud. US Crypto Owners Expect More Regulation Cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift. Speaking at a legal conference in New York, current and former senior government lawyers indicated that while financial fraud cases will still be pursued, the Justice Department’s focus will likely move toward immigration enforcement, a key campaign promise of Trump. Scott Hartman, co-chief of the securities and commodities task force at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan, revealed that fewer resources will be allocated to policing cryptocurrency crimes. As of late, the SEC has been facing growing criticism due to its “regulation-by-enforcement” approach to the crypto industry. Critics argue that the SEC has failed to establish a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies , opting instead to pursue legal action against key industry players.

At this price, Bitcoin’s market capitalization is well above $2 trillion, about $1.2 trillion higher than where it stood at the start of the year. November and now December have been the magic months for similar achievements. Bitcoin first broke through to five figures USD per one ($10,000) on November 28, 2017. It first reached four figures per coin ($1,000) on November 27, 2013. Bitcoin’s best-performing month historically, on average, is November – particularly during or after a Bitcoin halving year. Between 2010 and 2024, its average returns in this month exceed 35% . The new milestone has proven analysts at Standard Chartered correct, who predicted BTC to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024 as early as last year. In late October, Bitcoin broke beyond $100,000 Canadian dollars ($CAD) for the first time and flipped the total value of all Canadian dollars just a few weeks later.

Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Eric Adams is still bullish, and even bragged about Bitcoin's growth since accepting his first three paychecks in BTC. Controversy also surrounds the U.S. government’s recent $1.9 billion Bitcoin transfer to Coinbase, and critics like Jason Lowery called the move a huge strategic mistake. Powell Dismisses Bitcoin’s Impact on Dollar Dominance Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently reiterated that Bitcoin (BTC) is more comparable to gold than it is a competitor to the U.S. dollar. At The New York Times-hosted DealBook Summit in New York on Dec. 4, Powell described Bitcoin as a speculative asset, similar to virtual gold. He brushed off the notion that Bitcoin is widely used as a form of payment or a reliable store of value, and specifically pointed out its high volatility. ”It’s not a competitor for the dollar. It’s really a competitor for gold,” Powell stated. Jerome Powell at the DealBook Summit (Source: New York Times ) Powell also addressed the idea that Bitcoin reflects a loss of faith in the Federal Reserve and the U.S. dollar, and rejected the claim. When asked whether he owns Bitcoin, Powell clarified that he is prohibited from holding it. While he is not opposed to crypto companies conducting business with banks, he did mention that it is still important to safeguard the financial system’s stability and consumer protection. Bitcoin’s recent price surge to over $99,000 reignited discussions around its role in the financial system. This rally has been partly attributed to Donald Trump’s presidential election victory in November, which is seen as a boost for the pro-crypto movement in the United States. Trump’s cabinet appointments, including hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Secretary of Treasury and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as Secretary of Commerce, could signal that the U.S. is taking a much more crypto-friendly approach. Additionally, Trump’s reported favouritism of crypto advocate Paul Atkins taking over as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), after Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement, also proves that things are shifting for crypto in the U.S. While Trump has been quite critical of Powell’s policies , the Federal Reserve Chair made it clear he has no intention of stepping down, regardless of political pressure. NYC Mayor Eric Adams Defends Bitcoin New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is currently facing multiple criminal charges, recently referenced his Bitcoin holdings while mocking members of the press. After an event at the American LGBTQ+ Museum on Dec. 3, Adams responded to a question about Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s potential role in government by mentioning the Bitcoin he received while in office. Encouraging others not to fear Bitcoin, Adams quipped, “Remember y’all laughed at me when I first got my Bitcoin, who’s laughing now?” He recalled the criticism he faced for his decision to accept his first three paychecks in Bitcoin, and stated, “Now you wish you would have done it.” Adams became New York City’s mayor in January of 2022, and announced his intention to take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin when the cryptocurrency was priced at around $61,000. Since then, Bitcoin’s value rose to approximately $102,000, which is an impressive increase. His decision came as part of a broader push among elected officials to adopt crypto-based salaries, after Miami Mayor Francis Suarez’s similar pledge. Adams wanted to position New York City as a hub for the cryptocurrency industry. He often promotes crypto-friendly policies and criticises restrictive legislation, like the state’s 2022 two-year moratorium on non-renewable energy-based proof-of-work mining. However, Adams’ tenure has been marred by legal troubles. In September, he was indicted on charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, bribery, and accepting campaign contributions from foreign nationals. If he is convicted and sentenced consecutively, he could face decades in prison. Despite these challenges, Adams is still advocating for cryptocurrency. Government’s $1.9B Bitcoin Move Criticized by Experts The U.S. government’s recent decision to transfer $1.9 billion worth of Bitcoin to Coinbase attracted a lot of criticism from the crypto industry. Jason Lowery , a United States Space Force major and author, labeled the move a “strategic mistake,” and argued that selling Bitcoin fails to recognize the technology's significance. He also warned that actions like this could lead to future attempts by the government to reclaim the Bitcoin sold. He even compared it to the 1933 Executive Order 6102, which restricted gold ownership. The transfer was conducted on Dec. 2, and involved 19,800 BTC that was sent to a Coinbase Prime deposit address. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong completely agreed with Lowery’s sentiments, and suggested the government should keep its holdings. Other critics, including crypto educator Toby Cunningham , shared that any sold Bitcoin will very likely be quickly absorbed by the market. Despite speculation about an impending sale, analytics platform Spot On Chain suggested that the transfers might be custody-related rather than sales. Julio Moreno , the head of research at CryptoQuant, estimated that only 10,000 BTC were likely sold, with the rest moved to a new address. Spot On Chain data indicates the U.S. government still holds approximately 183,850 BTC, which is valued at $17.7 billion across various wallets. The transfer caused Bitcoin’s price to dip almost 3% to $94,500 before recovering. The lack of official confirmation of a sale also left traders with a lot of questions about the government’s intentions with its huge Bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin Whales Remain Cautious While Mayor Eric Adams seems very bullish on Bitcoin, traders are taking a more cautious approach. This is especially due to the fact that BTC still continues to hover close to $100,000. As a result, whales adopted a more cautious stance and crypto analysts are pointing to mixed market signals. According to CryptoQuant contributor Onat Tütüncüler , a large inflow of Bitcoin to exchanges has been observed since Donald Trump’s presidential election win, which could indicate a potential risk of future sell-offs. However, there is no immediate selling pressure, which suggests that large holders are taking a “wait-and-see” approach. Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio chart (Source: CryptoQuant ) Tütüncüler also pointed out that the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) does not yet indicate serious profit-taking activity, which aligns with typical bull run behavior where traders hold Bitcoin in anticipation of more growth. Despite this, Bitcoin dominance dropped a lot since Nov. 28, which could hint at a possible rotation into other cryptocurrencies. BTC's price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Bitcoin is currently trading hands at $102,888.78 after hitting a new all time high price of $103,900.47 over the past 24 hours. Long-term holders, who bought their Bitcoin at an average price of $24,994, have seen massive unrealized gains. Nonetheless, skepticism persists among traders with regards to Bitcoin’s ability to stay above $100,000 by the end of 2024.

BTC added 7.2% in the past 24 hours, data shows, zooming to a $2 trillion market capitalization for the first time as it set a record just over $103,670. It has since lost ground to $102,500 in Asian afternoon hours as traders took early profits on the move.  The asset has gained 50% in the past 30 days on increased institutional demand, rising ETF inflows, improved sentiment among traditional finance circles and optimism around Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency in the U.S. — one that has promised to make the country a hotbed for bitcoin activity.  Spot BTC ETFs in the U.S. notched up $533 million in net inflows on Wednesday, data shows, with BlackRock’s IBIT crossing $50 billion in net assets for the first time.  Such rapid price ascension has spurred fears of a local market top among some watchers that could send prices tumbling as low as $90,000. But a seasonally bullish holiday period, demand from ETFs and higher mainstream media attention could fuel more buying demand for BTC in the coming weeks, traders say.  Here’s what three traders are saying about the current rally, and future moves.  “With the positive headline of Powell’s comment that Bitcoin is digital gold and the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chair, BTC has finally reached 100k.""   However, we believe there is more room for a rally, as there must be some demand waiting for BTC to break 100k, which will capture more public attention. Moreover, BTC remains small compared to other macro assets, and the growth of its market cap will attract large institutions that are now able to allocate a meaningful size.” — Presto Research investment analyst Min Jung  “Bitcoin's recent surge past the $100,000 mark is not just a milestone; it represents a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. The confidence is spurred by an increasingly favorable regulatory environment in the U.S., particularly with the appointment of Paul Atkins to chair the SEC. This is likely to drive further institutional investment in the sector, giving Bitcoin more credibility and leading to a new wave of adoption.” — Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE.  “Although some speculators believe reaching $100k signals a market top, on-chain demand and macroeconomic indicators suggest Bitcoin still has a lot of momentum to push higher. This is further evident in the leading bearish narratives invalidated, such as the US presidential election and the regulator's stance towards crypto.""  ""While long-time holders may deleverage their positions, mainstream media and retail market investors have only started to notice the incredibly fast rise of Bitcoin at this key level, which may add to more buying pressure from a fear of missing out.” — Nick Ruck, Director at LVRG Research.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/05/traders-see-even-more-bitcoin-buying-pressure-as-btc-sets-new-record-at-103-k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/341805c332653c0fe7275854c29df986564dc256-1500x911.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dogecoin Will Hit $5 ‘Very Easy’ In 2025 – Analyst,"Dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that has gained popularity and surpassed $60 billion in market capitalization, is once again attracting attention. While the year got off to a shaky start for DOGE, it has since seen a significant upswing. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst DOGE has mostly consolidated at $0.40, which begs some questions about whether its moment of glory has vanished. Recent research, however, points the other way, with specialists looking at possible price levels that would inspire DOGE aficionados once more. Technical Support Points Toward Development Important technical indications have helped to propel the price trajectory of DOGE. Currently at $0.26, the 50-day moving average has been a consistent support level that has helped it to climb to $0.44. The 200-day moving average, which stays constant at $0.15, shows DOGE’s long-term consistency. $DOGE $XRP money will flow into $DOGE My first target is 1$ I think we will reach 3-5$ very easy next year pic.twitter.com/hf5w8FUOUs — ProfessorAstrones (@Astrones2) December 2, 2024 These metrics indicate a strong foundation for future growth. Analysts like Professor Astrones believe DOGE could soon end its consolidation phase and start moving toward $1. Beyond that, he projects the coin could hit $3 to $5 “very easily” in 2025. It’s an ambitious goal, but Dogecoin has surprised the market before. XRP’s Role In Dogecoin’s Future The recent success of XRP is an interesting part of the possible rise in DOGE. In the past week, the price of XRP has doubled, giving some long-term users over 400% returns. The market value of XRP has grown to more than twice that of Dogecoin thanks to this rise. Astrones, on the other hand, says that the rising trend in XRP may soon slow down. That could make buyers want to put their gains back into Dogecoin, which would make more people want to buy it. In the crypto market, gains are often spread to other assets, which means that money is often moved around. Is Dogecoin Mirroring XRP? Other market observers have noticed an interesting similarity between the recent patterns of XRP’s prices and DOGE’s chart currently. They said that DOGE is making higher lows, which is a sign of a bullish trend, meaning the upward movement is going to be sustainable. If this is the case, Dogecoin will explode like XRP and move its price way past current levels.

From Dogecoin’s meteoric rise to the waves of new contenders, the meme coin market is heating up. In December 2024, BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin, and Popcat are three of the best meme coins to invest in now, and it’s not hard to see why. Let’s start with BTFD Coin, which is absolutely taking the crypto world by storm. As of its 7th presale stage, BTFD Coin has raised over $900,000 and sold more than 21 billion coins. At a price of $0.000064 per coin, it’s an exciting opportunity for early investors. And, with over 2,000 Bulls on board and growing, BTFD Coin is one of the best meme coins to invest in now. But BTFD Coin isn’t alone in making waves. Pepe Coin, named after the infamous internet meme, and Popcat, the meme-inspired coin with a loyal fanbase, are also gaining traction. Let’s dive deeper into each of these meme coins to understand why they’re all worth your attention right now. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Ready to Explode BTFD Coin has become one of the best meme coins to invest in now due to its massive presale success and strong community backing. The concept behind BTFD Coin, which stands for “Buy The Dip,” is simple yet powerful. It is about capitalising on the market’s downturns and buying when prices are low. It’s the mentality that many experienced crypto traders swear by, and it’s the heart of this coin. At its current presale price of $0.000064, BTFD Coin is attracting a lot of early investors excited about the future. The price is expected to rise to $0.0006 once the presale ends, which would offer early investors a substantial return on their investment. Think about investing $50,000 today at this price? Well, good for you, because this means you would secure a jaw-dropping 781.25 million coins. If the price rises post-presale, that investment could easily turn into a mind-boggling $468,750! Yet, what sets BTFD Coin apart from other meme coins is its focus on community, with its “Bulls Squad” forming a strong and loyal following. The coin also offers high staking rewards, with an impressive APY of 90%, making it an attractive option for those looking for passive income. The coin’s future plans include a fully-fledged Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that will reward users with BTFD coins, as well as continuous marketing efforts aimed at building its ecosystem. With such a dedicated community and a solid roadmap, BTFD Coin is one of the best meme coins to invest in now, and there’s no sign of it slowing down. Pepe Coin: The Meme Coin with Staying Power Named after the famous Pepe the Frog meme, this coin has been gaining massive popularity. With its unique branding and a devoted community, Pepe Coin is quickly cementing itself as a long-term contender in the meme coin space. Trading at $0.0000209, Pepe Coin has experienced steady growth throughout 2024. The coin’s roadmap focuses on increasing utility and expanding its ecosystem. Plans for the future include partnerships with influencers, integration into decentralised finance (DeFi) projects, and a potential Play-to-Earn game featuring the iconic Pepe character. These developments could increase demand for Pepe Coin, driving its value up in the future. But it’s not just the plans for expansion that make Pepe Coin so appealing—it’s also the strength of its community. With millions of fans worldwide, Pepe Coin has a solid following that’s ready to push the coin to new heights. As Pepe Coin grows, its presence in the meme coin market continues to solidify, making it one of the best meme coins to invest in now. Popcat: The Meme Coin That’s Popping Off Next up is Popcat, a meme coin that has exploded onto the scene thanks to its fun, relatable concept and a highly engaged community. Inspired by the viral Popcat meme and the clicking game that everyone was going on about a few years ago, Popcat Coin has caught the attention of meme coin enthusiasts around the globe. The current price of Popcat is $1.40, and while it may seem pricey in comparison, it’s important to consider the community and momentum behind it. Like BTFD Coin and Pepe Coin, Popcat Coin has built a passionate following that believes in its potential to make it big in the meme coin market. The coin is also available on several decentralised exchanges (DEXs), increasing its liquidity and accessibility. Popcat Coin has big plans for 2025, including the launch of an NFT marketplace where users can buy and sell exclusive Popcat-themed art. This integration with the growing NFT space will help fuel the coin’s popularity even further. In addition, Popcat Coin’s community-driven approach and fun meme culture ensure it will continue to attract new investors in the future. For anyone looking for the best meme coins to invest in now, Popcat Coin is a great option. Conclusion: Secure Your Place in Meme Coin History The meme coin space is buzzing with opportunity, and BTFD Coin , Pepe Coin, and Popcat Coin are at the forefront of the action.

Don’t miss out on your chance to be part of the next big meme coin movement. With BTFD Coin’s presale rapidly approaching its end, now is the time to jump in and secure your position before prices rise. So, what are you waiting for?

37239468,https://coinpaper.com/6384/trump-picks-private-astronaut-jared-isaacman-to-head-nasa,1733376620,Trump Picks Private Astronaut Jared Isaacman to Head NASA,"President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team has signaled a shift in priorities for two key US agencies, with announcements of significant leadership changes on Dec. 4. Jared Isaacman, billionaire fintech CEO and private astronaut, has been nominated to head NASA, while pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins has been tapped to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Billionaire Fintech CEO and Astronaut Jared Isaacman Tapped to Lead NASA by President-elect Donald Trump President-elect Donald Trump announced on Dec. 4 that Jared Isaacman, a billionaire fintech mogul and experienced astronaut, has been nominated as the next Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). If confirmed by Congress, Isaacman will succeed Bill Nelson, becoming the 15th leader of the space agency. Isaacman, the CEO of Shift4 Payments, a financial technology company that processes over $260 billion annually across more than 200,000 clients, is no stranger to the realm of high stakes, whether in business or in space. His appointment reflects Trump’s vision for a NASA that continues to prioritize commercial partnerships, technological advancement, and an ambitious return to space exploration dominance. Isaacman’s path to potential NASA leadership is unconventional yet highly fitting. He is widely known for his adventurous spirit and trailblazing accomplishments in both aerospace and fintech. In 2021, Isaacman cemented his name in space exploration history as the financier and commander of SpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission, the first all-civilian spaceflight to orbit Earth. This groundbreaking mission was a showcase of private-public collaboration in the space sector. Not content with that achievement, Isaacman returned to orbit in September 2024 as the commander of the Polaris Dawn mission, during which he became the first private citizen to perform a spacewalk. Outside of his astronautic feats, Isaacman is an accomplished pilot certified on numerous civilian and military aircraft. His impressive résumé also includes a stint as a member of an aeronautical stunt team, where he flew jet aircraft in complex formations. In the business sphere, Isaacman co-founded and led Draken International, a prominent defense aerospace firm that provides tactical flight services for the US Department of Defense. This experience in defense and aerospace uniquely positions him to navigate NASA’s multifaceted operations, from scientific research to national security collaborations. President-elect Trump highlighted Isaacman’s dual expertise in business and space as central to his nomination. In a statement posted on Truth Social, Trump remarked, “I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Jared will drive NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in Space science, technology, and exploration.” Trump’s transition team has signaled that Isaacman’s leadership is expected to align NASA’s goals with the administration’s broader emphasis on private-sector partnerships, innovation, and economic competitiveness in space. With Isaacman’s deep ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, his nomination may further strengthen NASA’s collaboration with commercial spaceflight companies. A New Era for NASA Isaacman’s pending appointment comes at a critical juncture for NASA. As the agency continues to pursue its Artemis program to return humans to the Moon and looks ahead to potential crewed missions to Mars, the integration of commercial and governmental resources has never been more essential. Isaacman’s entrepreneurial mindset and firsthand spaceflight experience could bring a fresh perspective to the agency’s strategic objectives. His track record in leading cutting-edge projects, including the groundbreaking Inspiration4 and Polaris Dawn missions, suggests he will advocate for ambitious exploration initiatives. Observers expect him to focus on furthering advancements in space technology, enhancing NASA’s collaboration with private companies, and maintaining the US’s leadership in the global space race. Trump’s shake-up of federal leadership also includes the nomination of University of Maryland finance professor Michael Faulkender as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. Meanwhile, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has reportedly emerged as a contender for Secretary of Defense after Pete Hegseth was dropped from consideration. While Isaacman’s nomination has drawn praise from many quarters, including the aerospace and fintech communities, it also faces scrutiny. Critics argue that his lack of experience in managing a large government organization could be a hurdle, while others highlight his close ties to commercial space firms as a potential conflict of interest. Supporters, however, point to his proven leadership in both the private and public sectors and his ability to inspire public interest in space exploration as key assets. His nomination signals a bold step toward integrating commercial ingenuity with NASA’s storied tradition of scientific achievement. Jared Isaacman’s pending appointment as NASA Administrator marks a pivotal moment for the agency as it navigates the intersection of government-funded exploration and private-sector innovation. With his unique blend of aerospace expertise and entrepreneurial vision, Isaacman could usher in a transformative era for NASA, ensuring its continued role as a global leader in space exploration. As Congress prepares to deliberate on his confirmation, all eyes are on the billionaire-turned-astronaut, whose journey from fintech to the stars may soon add another chapter as the head of one of the world’s most iconic space agencies. President-elect Trump Nominates Pro-Crypto Paul Atkins to Lead the SEC In a bold move that signals a significant policy shift for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trump also announced on Dec. 4 the nomination of Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner and pro-crypto advocate, to replace Gary Gensler as the agency's chief. Atkins, the CEO and founder of Patomak Global Partners, a prominent risk management consultancy, has long been a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency innovation and blockchain technology. His appointment signals a sharp departure from Gensler’s tenure, which many in the crypto industry criticized as excessively combative and regulatory-heavy. In his announcement on Truth Social, Trump emphasized Atkins’ extensive experience and his advocacy for investor protection and transparency. “Paul is the CEO and Founder of Patomak Global Partners, a risk management consultancy. As Co-Chairman of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017, he has worked on and studied the digital assets industry. A former SEC Commissioner from 2002-2008, Paul strongly advocated for transparency and protecting investors.” Atkins’ nomination fulfills a campaign promise Trump made to crypto voters, where he pledged to bring regulatory clarity to the digital assets industry. The pro-crypto stance featured prominently in Trump’s keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, where he outlined his vision for fostering innovation in the United States through clearer crypto regulations and market-friendly policies. The nomination comes on the heels of Gary Gensler’s resignation on Nov. 21, a move many saw as inevitable after mounting criticism of his anti-crypto stance. Gensler, known for his aggressive approach to regulating the cryptocurrency sector, oversaw a record 104 lawsuits against blockchain companies and crypto firms between 2021 and 2023. These lawsuits, combined with unclear regulatory guidance, cost the industry an estimated $426 million in legal fees. The Blockchain Association was among the many groups that called for an end to what they described as “law-fare” against the sector. With Gensler’s departure, analysts and industry insiders are optimistic about a more collaborative approach under Atkins’ leadership. News of Gensler’s resignation and Trump’s pro-crypto election victory sparked a rally in cryptocurrency markets. Analysts predict this momentum could carry into 2025, fueled by expectations of reduced regulatory pressures and the potential approval of long-awaited crypto products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In the wake of Gensler’s resignation announcement, multiple firms, including Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, submitted applications for Solana (SOL)-based ETFs, signaling renewed confidence in the SEC’s openness to crypto innovation under new leadership. Katrina Paglia, chief legal officer at Pantera Capital, suggested that lawsuits targeting cryptocurrency firms and blockchain projects could “quietly go away” after Atkins assumes leadership at the SEC. Atkins’ Vision for the SEC Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, has built a reputation as a staunch advocate for balanced regulation. His work as Co-Chairman of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017 is indicative of his commitment to fostering innovation while protecting investors. In his consulting role at Patomak Global Partners, Atkins has advised on risk management and compliance for fintech and blockchain companies, gaining extensive insight into the challenges facing the crypto industry. Observers expect him to prioritize clear guidelines and reduce regulatory ambiguity, fostering an environment where innovation can thrive without compromising investor protections. Despite the optimism, Atkins faces significant challenges in reshaping the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrencies. The agency’s legacy under Gensler includes entrenched skepticism toward the industry and a reputation for aggressive enforcement. Rebuilding trust and establishing collaborative relationships with blockchain firms will likely require time and strategic effort. Moreover, Atkins’ nomination will need to pass Senate confirmation, where lawmakers divided on crypto issues could raise concerns about his industry-friendly stance. Critics argue that a pro-crypto SEC chief might prioritize innovation at the expense of stricter consumer safeguards. Atkins’ potential leadership marks a turning point for the SEC, signaling a departure from adversarial policies and an embrace of cryptocurrency as a legitimate financial sector. Industry leaders and market participants hope this shift will pave the way for regulatory clarity, enabling the US to compete globally in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. As the crypto community awaits congressional confirmation of Atkins’ nomination, the stakes are high for the SEC and the broader financial landscape. If confirmed, Atkins will be tasked with balancing the twin imperatives of fostering innovation and maintaining the SEC’s mandate to protect investors. For now, the nomination offers a glimmer of hope for an industry that has long sought a regulatory framework conducive to growth and collaboration. The question remains: Will Atkins be able to deliver on the promise of a crypto-friendly SEC, and can his leadership usher in a new era of innovation and trust?",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6384/trump-picks-private-astronaut-jared-isaacman-to-head-nasa,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Find out why experts are so bullish on the Rollblock platform, which is being tipped for stunning 50x returns from current levels. Hedera ($HBAR) Pumps On Worldpay Partnership News Hedera has dropped by 15% today, bringing the Hedera price down to support at $0.28. A large 52% drop in exchange-traded volume has indicated that Hedera traders are reluctant to step in at these levels and will be waiting for confirmation of Hedera’s ongoing bullish momentum. This is not surprising, as Hedera holders have recently enjoyed incredible 720% gains, with its price rallying from $0.04 at the start of this month. Recently, Worldpay announced that it will be using Hedera’s innovative proof-of-reserves system to operate as a trust layer for its stablecoin launch. Hedera will oversee the minting and backing of its stablecoins, in a move that should propel Hedera further toward the $1 level in the weeks ahead. Solana ($SOL) Drops Down The Rankings But Should Rally With ETF Approval Solana has recently fallen to 5th place in the CoinMarketCap top 10 crypto index, after Ripple overtook Solana in the rankings. Solana has seen a 3% pump today, which is encouraging but still lagging the double-digit returns of many of its competitors. Solana recently made a new all-time high with its pump to $263 before it faced a rejection down to support at $218. It has emerged recently that Grayscale has filed the paperwork for a dedicated Solana spot ETF fund with the New York Stock Exchange. If approved, this will see a wall of institutional money flow into the Solana ecosystem, which should propel Solana far beyond $300 during Q1 of 2025. Rollblock ($RBLK) Heading For Pole Position With Sports Betting Bonanza Since its launch earlier this year, Rollblock ( $RBLK ) has risen to the top of the crypto presale pile and attracted more than 22,000 early adopters who have come to see the vast potential Rollblock offers to disrupt one of the most lucrative industries out there. Rollblock uses the mighty power of the Ethereum blockchain to securely inscribe all of its casino transactions on-chain. This is a game-changer for the entire gaming space. The Rollblock platform is a fully functioning, community-backed GambleFi powerhouse featuring over 7,000 popular casino games and a brand-new sports betting league that allows armchair sports pundits to get involved and win stacks of $RBLK with their expert knowledge. $RBLK is looking like a future crypto gaming blue chip, thanks to its undeniable utility and attractive tokenomics, which will see a hefty portion of Rollblock profits reinvested each week in buying back the token on exchanges. This will result in 60% of these tokens being burned forever, and the remaining 40% finding their way back to stakers in the community. Experts are united in predicting a meteoric rise for Rollblock this year, as its price is set to appreciate rapidly from the current level of $0.037.

The reason behind being bearish on BTC was the rise of the other altcoins like XRP and ADA, which smashed $1 after being consolidated for a long time. However, after the star tokens take back control, these altcoins are experiencing a notable upward pressure. While bearish predictions below $2 may hover over the XRP price rally, the token may either extend the consoldaition or undergo a suitable upswing in a short while. The recent dump in prices has dropped XRP from the top 3 cryptos as Tether overtakes to reclaim the third position. This compels us to wonder whether the traders have booked their profits or continue to remain optimistic. This can be gauged by the exchange reserves, which hint at the traders mindset. The balance on exchanges shed light on the probable next move of the traders and indicates whether they are bullish or bearish over the token. Holding cryptos on exchanges suggests the traders are thinking of selling or swapping the token, which has been noticed recently. After the XRP price marked yealy highs, the exchange reserves piled up, suggesting the traders are preparing for a trade. However, the daily active address and the transaction count have both dropped, suggesting no immediate action could be taken. The markets have become bullish as Bitcoin has smashed the historic $100K milestone, which signals the liquidity flow back to the star token. However, after the rally cools down, these tokens are about to scale up and set up a monstrous rally. The short-term trade suggests the price is trading within a rising, expanding channel, and after the recent breakdown, the price is facing massive upward pressure. The RSI is plunging, which indicates the price may continue to drop and reach the lower support zone between $1.83 and $1.94, which is also the support of the wedge.However, the selling volume remains restricted compared to that of the buying, suggesting a strong rebound could be fast approaching. The Bitcoin price rally is expected to slow down after marking highs around $108,000, which could enable the altcoins to thrive. This could be when the XRP price may revamp a strong rise and surpass it’s previous ATH and achieve $4.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-xrp-price-going-down-while-the-market-sentiments-turn-bullish/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37239689,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51393,1733375957,Analyst Displays Ascending Triangle That Could Send XRP to $17 and $27,"EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a prominent cryptocurrency analyst, recently shared an insightful chart on XRP’s price trajectory, presenting two potential future price targets: $17 and $27. XRP gained traction, especially after reaching $2.86, its highest level since 2018. The technical analysis suggests significant opportunities ahead. Chart Analysis and Observations The chart highlights XRP’s performance within a multi-year ascending trend line, which has served as a strong support framework since 2018. This long-term bullish trend underpins the cryptocurrency’s resilience and positions XRP for potential exponential growth. The pattern identified in the chart is an ascending triangle, a classic technical formation associated with bullish breakouts. This triangle is characterized by a horizontal resistance level and an upward-sloping support line. According to the chart, XRP has decisively broken out of this structure, signaling a strong upward trend continuation. #XRP – $17 or $27? – You Decide The answer is in the chart! Take a close look and decide – which one do YOU think is more plausible? $17 or $27? #XRPFamily : STAY STEADY & STRONG . We could face a major pullback ahead, but don’t let the FUD shake you. These pullbacks are… pic.twitter.com/26EzkDjETk — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 3, 2024 Key Levels to Look Out For Support at $1.22 (0.702 Fibonacci Level): This level, marked on the chart, represents a critical accumulation area. It is expected to act as a strong support level in the event of a pullback. Intermediate Resistance at $9.12 (1.272 Fibonacci Level): This resistance may slow XRP’s ascent before it attempts higher targets. However, this is below the final targets, suggesting that EGRAG CRYPTO is confident that the digital asset will surpass it. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Major Targets—$17 and $27 : These targets are derived from Fibonacci extensions and historical patterns. The $17 level is close to the 1.414 Fibonacci extension, while $27 is close to the 1.618 extension, a key extension level often signifying the cycle peak. Notably, the analyst has previously predicted a rise to these targets through a similar ascending triangle. The chart also emphasizes caution, warning of potential pullbacks before XRP reaches these lofty targets. As noted by EGRAG CRYPTO, pullbacks should be viewed as opportunities to accumulate rather than as deterrents to long-term positioning. How to Maximize Returns from this Cycle Egrag’s analysis highlights the importance of discipline during volatile phases. He advised investors to employ approaches like Dollar Sell Averaging (DSA) and to consider securing profits by withdrawing initial capital once comfortable levels are reached. These steps can mitigate risks while capitalizing on upward momentum. XRP is currently trading at $2.55, and although it has dropped over 6% from yesterday, it is up almost 80% from last week. The asset’s renewed attention from institutional investors has been a significant driver of its recent surge. As regulatory clarity improves and adoption increases, XRP’s utility in the financial ecosystem could further enhance its appeal, supporting the long-term bullish thesis outlined in the chart.

The flagship coin surged more than 7 percent in the past 24 hours to trade above $102,900 on Thursday, December 5, during the early Asian session. Consequently, more than $644 million was liquidated from the crypto-leveraged market, led by Bitcoin with over $169 million. Furthermore, the previously reported altcoin rally cooled down in the past 24 hours, as Bitcoin dominance surged above 56 percent again. MicroStrategy Stock Heavily Benefited the Bitcoin Rally Since adopting the Bitcoin strategy in August 2020, MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) has purchased more than 402,100 Bitcoins to date, worth more than $40 billion. Earlier this week, MicroStrategy announced the acquisition of 15.4k Bitcoins, after raising $1.5 billion through stock sales. As a result of the continued Bitcoin adoption, MSTR shareholders have significantly benefited through value addition. Furthermore, the company has achieved a BTC yield of 38.7 percent quarter-to-date (QTD) and 63.3 percent year-to-date (YTD).

In the past 24 hours, MSTR stock surged over 10 percent to trade at about $410.85 during the U.S. after-trading session. Consequently, the company’s valuation has rallied exponentially in the past months to hover about $83.9 billion at the time of this writing. Bigger Picture The notable rise of MicroStrategy over the past years, despite not having a major product in the market, has significantly influenced other companies around the world. The adoption of the strategic Bitcoin reserve has also been discussed at the national level, with the upcoming Trump administration expected to enact a similar law to purchase at least 1 million BTCs over the next five years. Consequently, Bitcoin price is on a trajectory to higher levels in the coming months amid heightened institutional FOMO and robust fundamentals.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO.

37237756,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373413,1733373218,South Korea’s Crypto Trading Volume Hits Record $34B Amid Martial Law Controversy,"On December 3, South Korea witnessed a historic surge in cryptocurrency trading as the nation dealt with the declaration of martial law. Trading volumes in the Korean virtual asset market skyrocketed to approximately $34.6 billion within 24 hours, marking the highest recorded level of the year. XRP Drives Record Trading Volume According to local reports citing CoinGecko data, from 9:00 AM on December 3 to 9:00 AM on December 4, trading volumes across the Won Market Exchange reached around 49 trillion won ($34.6 billion). This figure surpassed the previous high of around 34.7 trillion won ($24.5 billion) recorded just a day earlier. Upbit emerged as the dominant player among South Korea’s crypto exchanges, recording a trading volume of 39.69 trillion won ($28 billion). Bithumb followed with 8.99 trillion won ($6.35 billion), while Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax accounted for 760 billion won ($537 million), 260 billion won ($183.7 million), and 11.5 billion won ($8.1 million), respectively. Notably, a significant portion of this activity was driven by Ripple’s XRP, which recorded a trading volume of 11.13 trillion won ($800 million) on Upbit alone. This development follows another major milestone for the South Korean crypto market. A recent 10X research revealed that the country’s retail crypto trading volumes surged to $18 billion on December 2, marking the second-highest level of the year. The increase was driven by major trading activity in several altcoins. In this instance, too, Ripple’s XRP led the charge, contributing over $6.3 billion in trading volume to the total. XRP has been experiencing a remarkable rally over the past month, surpassing the $2.80 threshold for the first time in almost seven years. According to CoinGecko data , at the time of writing, the token was trading at $2.63, up over 420% in the last month. Market Reaction to Martial Law Declaration The increase in trading volume coincided with South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol’s declaration of martial law on the evening of December 3, around 10:30 PM. The announcement triggered significant volatility in the crypto market, causing rapid buying and selling activity shifts. As the news broke, major digital currencies experienced large declines in value, with many dropping 30-40%. Bitcoin was one of the affected assets. On December 3, the token’s price faced what industry insiders call a “flash crash” on Upbit, the nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The incident lasted less than 15 minutes, during which Bitcoin’s price plunged to around $61,500, a drop of about 30%. However, it quickly recovered shortly after the decline. Following a resolution from the National Assembly, President Yoon lifted martial law by 4:30 AM on December 4.

37237647,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=657386,1733373003,Bitcoin’s Next Move? Coinbase Premium Suggests a Short-Term Rally May Be Brewing,"According to recent insights, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be on the verge of another rally, which suggests the potential for short-term upward momentum. At the heart of this discussion is the Coinbase Premium Index, a critical indicator analyzed in one hour by CryptoQuant analyst Yonsei Dent. This metric and specific moving average trends have highlighted conditions that could pave the way for Bitcoin to regain its upward trajectory. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin $100,000 Goal In Jeopardy? Options Market Show Increased Downside Protection Upward Move On The Horizon The Coinbase Premium Index measures the price gap between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges, offering a glimpse into market sentiment and institutional demand. Dent’s analysis zeroes in on the daily (24-hour) and weekly (168-hour) moving averages. Historical data indicates that significant Bitcoin price movements tend to occur when the daily average decisively crosses above the weekly average—a pattern commonly called a “golden cross.” According to Dent’s findings, the weekly moving average has recently transitioned from a negative slope to a positive one, setting the stage for a potential golden cross. This shift is significant, as previous instances of a positive slope combined with a golden cross have been followed by pronounced price increases. Additionally, Bitcoin is forming higher lows, a bullish signal, while also shaping a converging triangle pattern. If demand levels rise adequately, these technical patterns could signal the beginning of a renewed uptrend. While these indicators point to optimism, the CryptoQuant analyst emphasizes the importance of sustained demand. The analyst mentioned that historical patterns suggest that once this sufficient demand materializes, Bitcoin often experiences strong upward momentum, potentially attracting retail and institutional investors back into the market. Technical Outlook On Bitcoin Bitcoin is trading at $96,216, reflecting a 0.3% increase in the past day and a 1.3% rise over the past week. Amid this price activity, a report from another CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, highlights notable behavior among US investors, who seem to be taking advantage of even minor dips in BTC’s value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Supported By All-Stablecoins Cash Inflow – Data Reveals Strong Correlation Kesmeci revealed that within the last 24 hours, Coinbase recorded two significant withdrawal transactions, each exceeding 8,000 BTC, highlighting sustained investor interest in the asset.

37237699,https://blockworks.co/news/btc-new-all-time-high-100k,1733371790,Bitcoin sets new all-time high above $100K,"We’ve hit a milestone moment for bitcoin. A single bitcoin is now worth $100,000 as crypto prepares for President-elect Donald Trump to take office next month. After the fresh all-time high, bitcoin is truly in price discovery mode — all-time highs have now been smashed against gold and benchmark stock market indexes . It certainly has been a huge year for bitcoin, which started in January around $42,000. It’s now more than doubled that figure. Bitcoin’s price has continued to climb since surpassing $100,000, and as of press time, is trading around $103,000 on Coinbase, according to TradingView data . Image Credit: TradingView/BTC The development came hours after the Trump transition formally announced its nominee for SEC chair Gary Gensler’s job: Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner and current consultancy CEO whose firm has worked with crypto clients. Bitcoin hitting the milestone underscores “BTC as the revolutionary asset its advocates have long championed. You cannot afford to ignore an asset that capitalized itself from $0 to $2 trillion in 15 years,” Galaxy’s Alex Thorn told Blockworks. Bitcoin has achieved multiple milestones in 2024, from the launch of the bitcoin ETFs to the halving . At this point, it’s hard to keep track of how many all-time highs it carved out this year so far. Then there are all of the bullish indicators around bitcoin hoarder MicroStrategy and the bitcoin ETFs. MicroStrategy boosted its latest debt offering from $1.75 billion to $2.6 billion last month, citing high demand. The raise is its largest to date, and ended up rounding out to $3 billion. The firm will, of course, be spending the cash on more bitcoin , even if it means buying the top , co-founder and former CEO Michael Saylor has previously said. Prior to bitcoin reaching $100,000, GSR’s Brian Rudick said that the firm believed bitcoin could continue to push higher after topping six figures. “For instance, Trump is likely to appoint pro-Bitcoiners to key agency and cabinet positions , which can push prices higher. SEC Chair Gensler may resign and the SEC may inform recipients of Wells notices that it will no longer pursue enforcement, or reduce charges / settle existing cases,” Rudick explained. Gensler, on Thursday, announced that he’d be leaving the SEC when Trump takes office in January. “Further, the impact of having a comprehensive digital assets framework in the US, should it occur, cannot be understated, and would likely ignite a new wave of participation and development, propelling the industry to new heights. And, other countries such as China, wanting to remain competitive in light of the US’s newfound openness, may unban crypto or become more accommodative to the space.” The $100,000 level values bitcoin at roughly $2 trillion, which — as Rudick pointed out — makes “it the seventh most valuable asset in the world by market cap, just behind the likes of Google and Amazon.” Whether the six-figure record converts to a fully-fledged altcoin season is the next obvious question for market participants.

The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance. XRP Price Revisits Key Support At $2.20 XRP price made another attempt to clear the $2.70 resistance. However, it failed to surpass $2.70 and corrected some gains unlike Bitcoin and like Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.50 and $2.40 levels. A low was formed at $2.166 and the price is now correcting losses. There was a move above the $2.20 and $2.25 levels. The bulls pushed it back above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.865 swing high to the $2.166 low. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.40 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.865 swing high to the $2.166 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.50 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $2.550. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.70 resistance or even $2.850 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $2.500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.250 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.20 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support and the trend line. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone.

37240165,https://invezz.com/?p=2369651,1733371320,Shiba Inu price analysis: Here’s why SHIB is set to explode higher,"Shiba Inu price rose on Thursday as investors reacted to the ongoing Bitcoin surge. The SHIB token jumped to a high of $0.00003268, its highest level since March 14 this year. It has risen by about 200% from its lowest level this year. Shiba Inu price analysis The daily chart shows that the SHIB price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months. It has jumped to a high of $0.00003260, its highest level since March this year. The coin has formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish sign. This pattern is made up of a horizontal and a rounded bottom. In most periods, this is one of the most popular bullish continuation sign. Shiba Inu has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) crossed each other. The coin has moved to the Weak, Stop & Reverse of the Murrey Math Lines. This means that Shiba Inu has more room to go to get to the extreme overshoot level at $0.00004172. Shiba Inu has moved above the Ichimoku cloud indicator. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Oscillator have continued rising. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the coin will likely continue soaring as bulls target the key resistance at $0.000045, which is about 40% above the current level. The stop loss of the Shiba Inu coin is $0.0000268, the top of trading range. A drop below that level will point to more downside. SHIB price chart Why the SHIB price may continue rising There are a few reasons why the SHIB price may continue rising in the near term. First, the coin will benefit from the ongoing crypto bull run. Bitcoin has moved above the $100,000 , meaning that the coin has more room to grow. In most periods, altcoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin do well when Bitcoin is rising. Second, Shiba Inu price will continue doing well as more coins are incinerated. Data shows that over 2.5 million coins were burned in the past 24 hours. Altogether, over 410 trillion tokens have already been burned. The circulating supply of these coins stood at over 583 million. Also, 5.3 trillion SHIB coins have been staked. Third, SHIB price will likely do well as its ecosystem continues to grow. Data by DeFi Llama shows that ShibaSwap has a total value locked (TVL) of over $28.7 million. Its anualized fees have moved to over $3 million. Meanwhile, the number of Shibarium has handled over 602 million transactions as the number of accounts rose to 208k. The number of total addresses is nearing 2 million. The growth of Shibarium and ShibaSwap is important for Shiba Inu because the fees charged are converted into SHIB and burned.

37237899,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51336,1733371258,"Top 5 Crypto Coins That Are Positioned For 30,560% Gains By The End Of Q4 2024","The crypto market is buzzing with potential, and as we approach the close of 2024, certain crypto coins stand out as frontrunners for explosive growth. Among these crypto coins are Pepe (PEPE), Dogwifhat (WIF), Chainlink (LINK), WallitIQ (WLTQ), and Sui (SUI). These crypto coins have unique attributes that drive their appeal; however, one token, in particular, is stealing the spotlight – WallitIQ (WLTQ) . WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale: Poised For 30,560% Gains By Q4 2024 With AI-Driven Innovation The crypto world is packed with projects, but not all crypto coins are created equal. While some rely on hype, others, like WLTQ, stand out by solving real-world problems with cutting-edge innovation. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is one such opportunity, with its presale phase giving early participants a chance to secure a spot in a platform set to redefine decentralized wallets. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is quickly becoming the standout contender for the next big crypto gem with its combination of machine learning and AI technology. And here’s the exciting part: it’s still early, meaning you can join before the masses catch on. With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, an audited smart contract with Solidproof providing top-tier security, and visibility gaining on CoinMarketCap , WallitIQ (WLTQ) is already ahead of the curve. Crypto analysts and even whales are eyeing WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a serious contender for a 30,560% gain in the next crypto boom. As outlined in its presale plan, the starting price of WLTQ is just $0.0171. By the final stage, it is expected to experience substantial growth, potentially reaching significant price milestones as demand for the token escalates. Pepe (PEPE) After being listed on Ethereum, Pepe (PEPE) reached a market cap of $1.6 billion, capturing the interest of crypto users. According to CoinMarketCap data, Pepe (PEPE) is the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization, following Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Over the past month, the price of Pepe (PEPE) has increased by 106.3%, with a trading price of $0.00001964 as of when writing. CoinMarketCap also reveals that Pepe (PEPE) has slightly declined by 1.4%. With the potential for a new bull run in meme coins, Pepe (PEPE) could see even more growth, potentially gaining 30,560% by the end of 2024. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) , one of the standout Solana (SOL) crypto coins, combines creativity with solid growth potential. Launched on the Raydium Solana DEX in November 2023, Dogwifhat (WIF) started at just $0.000001366. In 2024, Dogwifhat (WIF) surged to $4.69, an increase of around 1800% in the previous year. Dogwifhat (WIF) is prone to sudden price swings like other crypto coins. However, the evolving crypto market, along with emerging regulations and market trends, could influence the long-term potential of Dogwifhat (WIF). With a dedicated community and innovative features like the WIF Hat generator, Dogwifhat (WIF) remains a crucial player in the Solana meme coin space. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink (LINK) has climbed 30% this month, though a broader perspective reveals a 50% drop in Chainlink (LINK) since spring. With a market cap exceeding $8.7 billion, Chainlink (LINK) remains one of the crypto coins leading the crypto world. As DeFi and blockchain technology expand, the ability of Chainlink (LINK) to provide secure and reliable data feeds solidifies its role as a critical asset in the industry. At the time of writing, Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $19. Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) is a scalable, secure layer-1 blockchain platform that uses an object-centric data model and the Move language to enhance transaction speed. With features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions, Sui (SUI) removes barriers for users, positioning itself as a leading Web3 platform and a promising investment before year-end. Investing in Sui (SUI) now means betting on a platform likely to be foundational as blockchain technology integrates further into everyday applications. With the commitment of Sui (SUI) to accessibility and high performance, Sui (SUI) is a promising buy before the year’s end. Wrapping Up While crypto coins like Pepe (PEPE) fuel excitement and established players like Chainlink (LINK) drive innovation in blockchain oracles, newcomers like Dogwifhat (WIF) and Sui (SUI) are carving out niches in Web3 connectivity and scalable blockchain solutions. Yet, WLTQ’s unique blend of utility, innovation, and an active presale phase makes it the most compelling choice for investors looking to ride the next big crypto wave. Don’t miss your chance to invest early in this DeFi token and ride the potential 30,560% gains.

37236653,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=25886,1733370900,Binance.US Lists Pepe Memecoin Amid Growing Competition,"Binance.US has added the popular memecoin Pepe ($PEPE) to its platform as U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges compete for a share of the expanding memecoin market. Starting Dec. 5 at 11:00 am UTC, PEPE will be tradable against Tether’s stablecoin, USDt ($USDT), the exchange announced on Dec. 4. “Since its inception, PEPE has seen significant popularity among network participants, largely driven by social media and community support,” Binance.US stated. As of Dec. 4, PEPE held a market capitalization nearing $9 billion, according to CoinGecko. Memecoin Listings on the Rise Following President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, U.S. exchanges like Binance.US and Coinbase have been expanding their offerings of memecoins. Tom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s vice president of international policy, highlighted the trend in November, saying, “We’re talking more about some of the smaller tokens, some of the memecoin tokens.” In recent months, Coinbase has listed memecoins such as Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF). Binance.US also introduced Bonk ($BONK), a dog-themed memecoin, in November. Currently, memecoins collectively hold a market capitalization of over $130 billion, per CoinGecko. Mixed Reactions Memecoins have sparked debate within the crypto community. Influencers like Murad Mahmudov argue that memecoins serve a purpose by reducing speculative premiums in altcoins. Conversely, others like Jimmy Song view them as risky and speculative. The Story of Pepe Created in 2005 by artist Matt Furie, Pepe the Frog became an internet sensation and later a cryptocurrency symbol. While initially a “peaceful frog-dude,” Pepe stirred controversy during the 2016 U.S. election due to its use by alt-right groups. Despite the backlash, the Anti-Defamation League stated, “the majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have been, and continue to be, non-bigoted.”",NEUTRAL,USDT | PEPE,EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT | PEPE | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/binance-us-lists-pepe-memecoin-amid-growing-competition/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

It was the most awaited milestone for the leading cryptocurrency in this bull cycle. Bitcoin has increased by 126% from the beginning of 2024 till date. Resisting the pushbacks in between, BTC managed to cross the $100k mark in the final month of 2024, right before President Trump prepares to take office. Michael Saylor calls for a $100k Bitcoin party There is going to be a 100K Party. 🚀 https://t.co/Vo52KQZRe5 — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 5, 2024 Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy Inc., who is among the biggest holders of this bullish asset, celebrated the milestone in a tweet and called for a $100k party. Peter Schiff, a major skeptic of Bitcoin, replied to Saylor’s tweet, saying “enjoy it while it lasts”. His comment is unsurprisingly followed by trolls in the crypto community, telling him he is not invited to the party with such an attitude. Bitcoin’s surge before Donald Trump’s election was largely fueled by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) dedicated to Bitcoin. After a long legal battle between one of the fund providers and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, these ETFs started trading in January. These funds are backed by major players on Wall Street, including BlackRock Inc, Fidelity, and crypto-focused Grayscale Investments. The total assets they manage have now increased to $100 billion, which equates to roughly 5% of all Bitcoin in circulation. The bull run for Bitcoin may have officially started after Donald Trump won the presidential election, as the asset has increased by 48% since then. BTC is up by 7.36% in the last 24 hours The price of BTC has reached $103,250 at the time of this writing, and its market value has reached $2 trillion after reaching the latest milestone. According to a new report by Bloomberg , BTC has become one of the largest investment assets in the world at this level, larger than most public companies except giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The valuation also means that Bitcoin has outstripped the size of government bond markets in countries as large as Spain and Brazil. It is also close to being the same size as the total value of the FTSE 100, which represents the top British companies. As per Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper Technologies Ltd “ Bitcoin reaching $100,000 signals the next phase of the bull run, one that now appears resilient to anything but exogenous shocks”.

37236159,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389386,1733369975,Why Is Bitcoin Going Up? How High Can Bitcoin Go?,"The post Why Is Bitcoin Going Up? How High Can Bitcoin Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has finally crossed $100,000. Adding 7% in the last three days and 4% today, BTC peaked at $104,630 before retracing back to $101,132. This gives the crypto community new hope that the bull cycle is still on. Let’s analyse what is happening in the market and why is Bitcoin going up today. Bitcoin Hit $100K The $100k mark has been a very heavy psychological resistance for Bitcoin, which it passed this morning. As we talked about how new buying can support the price and raise it, we saw huge volume coming in to push the price up. The Fear and Greed index was recorded at 84 this morning, displaying that the market still has potential for buying. The biggest crypto needs to cement the support as there is no moving average present in this area for assistance. How High Can Bitcoin Go? The RSI is currently at 76.41 showing bulls are charging, however it will soon enter the overbought zone and will have to cool off. On the other hand, ADX is at 17.57 which is considerably low but has started to rise. Bitcoin is experiencing heavy volume with a rise of 35% in the last 24 hours, most of which came in the last hour.BTC has reached at almost $100B in trading volume which pushes the marketcap of total crypto market to $3.69 trillion with a rise of 4.97%. Bitcoin dominance over the market is at 55.5% which is comparatively low. There are many factors pumping the force into Bitcoin. According to experts, the most influential part is the pro crypto President, Donald Trump. Since the US election, the crypto market has gained huge momentum with Bitcoin and altcoins adding huge numbers to their prices. The community is feeling relaxed towards crypto as Trump is working to get pro crypto people into his administration. Are you curious to know if the Bitcoin price will hit $120,000 this 2024?

People are going in with huge confidence & greed which is a great time for the market to rekt them. Just in the last one hour, over $130 million worth of funds were liquidated, most of which came in from shorts. The market takes some steps back in order to retest the support and if it fails to do so, the price can plummet under panic.

37235921,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=657617,1733369411,"November Crypto Performance: Memecoins Up 95%, ADA, SOL, And DOT Follow With Strong Gains","In what has been one of the most bullish months of the year, asset manager and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer VanEck released a report highlighting significant gains in the memecoin sector, alongside notable performances from major cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Stellar (XLM). Solana’s Ecosystem Thrives According to VanEck’s analysis, Solana delivered a 42% return in November, with the SOL token hitting an all-time high of $262. This increase was largely driven by a surge in on-chain trading activity related to memecoins, which led the general market rally with a 95% increase during the month. This drove Solana’s revenues and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes to unprecedented levels. In fact, Solana generated $177 million in revenue in November, doubling the previous month’s high of $74 million. Related Reading: BNB Surges 18% To Hit Record High Close To $800: Is Further Growth On The Horizon? This rush of activity also benefited projects such as Jito and Pump.fun, which generated revenues of $185 million and over $92 million, respectively. Jito operates as an on-chain application that generates revenue through maximal extracted value (MEV), which is derived from arbitrage opportunities created during DEX trading. Meanwhile, Pump.fun captures revenue directly from memecoin trading, showcasing the dual benefits of Solana’s vibrant ecosystem. Solana’s success was further underscored by its wallet, Phantom, claiming the top spot in Apple’s “free utility apps” category, and Robinhood reinstating SOL trading on its platform. In addition, the popular non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden announced an upcoming token airdrop, which is expected to stimulate further on-chain trading. Cardano And Polkadot Lead Crypto Altcoin Rallies Cardano’s ADA was another standout performer in November, achieving an impressive 201% increase. This rally was spurred by off-chain developments and speculation surrounding the influence of Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, in shaping future crypto policy. Following Hoskinson’s announcement of establishing a crypto policy office in Washington, D.C., ADA experienced a significant price surge. The upward momentum continued with Robinhood’s relisting of ADA and an update to Cardano’s governance structure, which emphasized on-chain decision-making by ADA holders. On-chain usage metrics reflected Cardano’s price movement, with total value locked (TVL) surging by 180% as various Cardano project tokens rallied. However, despite these gains, Cardano’s absolute figures in stablecoins and daily DEX volumes remain modest compared to Ethereum (ETH), highlighting a potential area for growth.

Key Support Levels And Future Targets Polkadot, often viewed as an underperformer in the crypto space, also saw a surprising rally in November. While its ecosystem has struggled with slow onboarding and technical challenges, recent developments, particularly from the Mythos Chain—a gaming blockchain hosting popular titles like NFL Rivals—have invigorated interest. Polkadot’s founder, Gavin Wood, also unveiled plans for a more agile architecture, allowing for enhanced interoperability and cloud-like services, which could position Polkadot favorably against other crypto assets like Ethereum and Celestia. In the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, major protocols such as Aave, Uniswap, and Sky (formerly MakerDAO) demonstrated strength, with significant fee increases and market activity. Aave crossed a milestone of $30 billion in deposits, positioning it among the largest banks by deposits if it were a traditional institution. Meanwhile, Uniswap’s market position was bolstered by a favorable court ruling regarding the legality of immutable smart contracts, which spurred a substantial increase in its market capitalization.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/doge-christmas-dogechris-solana-memecoin-will-explode-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Bulls are already targeting levels beyond $103k at the time of writing. As the focus has now shifted to Bitcoin, the second largest cryptocurrency–Ethereum is also showing strong bullish momentum. Right now, Ethereum is breaking out towards $4,000 and looking at the weekly Ethereum chart, the price is showing strong performance ahead. Ethereum is approaching a major resistance zone around $3.9K to $4K. If it breaks above these levels, the next target would be the previous all-time high, around $4.7K to $4.9K, just under $5,000. On the 3-day chart, Ethereum is moving above $3.2K, which was resistance and is now acting as support. It also has support around $3.5K. The next resistance zone to watch is between $3,850 and $4,000, which are the previous highs. On the daily chart, Ethereum is still breaking out above previous resistance, now acting as support. The altcoin has seen strong buying around $3,430 to $3,560, confirming the breakout. There’s a potential bearish divergence forming, but it’s not confirmed yet since we haven’t seen a strong rejection in the RSI. For now, things are looking more bullish than bearish. For short-term gains, it’s crucial to watch the $3,750 level. A confirmed break above this could lead to a surge towards $4,600, and eventually, higher targets. Looking ahead, Ethereum is forming a cup and handle pattern, and some analysts predict prices could reach $7,400 or even $10,000. However, right now, Ethereum faces resistance at $4000 and we need to break and hold above that level to move higher. Ethereum’s strong uptrend is supported by large institutional investments, with Ethereum ETF inflows recently surpassing Bitcoin’s. This trend hints at positive price action for Ethereum, and many believe it could reach new highs by the end of the year, possibly even breaking its all-time high.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ethereum-price-today-altcoin-nears-4000-amid-bitcoins-100k-hype/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37235626,https://cryptonews.com/?p=308261,1733368916,Bitcoin Soars To $100k – What Drove The Price Up and What’s Next?,"Bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high (ATH) of $103,600 on Thursday, December 5, during early Asian trading hours. Bitcoin’s highly anticipated six-figure milestone comes just hours after Donald Trump officially nominated pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC Chair . After a week of sideways movement Bitcoin finally broke through $100,000. The reason for this current rally has been linked to Donald Trump winning the 2024 United States Presidential Election . $100k Bitcoin Was Imminent Market analysts believe that Bitcoin breaking $100,000 was imminent, as a number of factors perfectly aligned to drive the price up. Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata, told Cryptonews that major catalysts for the price increase include tax policy around crypto, along with talks of strategic BTC reserves and continued inflows into Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) . Bitcoin has certainly been on a roll lately. BTC just recently became the seventh-largest asset by market cap in the world. It’s also impressive that within the past 10 trading days, Bitcoin ETFs have seen an incredible amount of inflows, totalling over $3.5 billion as of last week. According to Farside data , this brings the total amount of Bitcoin ETF inflows to $31.6 billion since their introduction in January this year. Record Breaking Inflows Into Bitcoin ETFs Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at multisig Bitcoin vault maker Theya, told Cryptonews that it’s impressive to see the crypto industry have several consecutive days of record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. “There has also been roughly $1.12 billion in short positions between here and $100,000, clustered heavily between $91.5k and $92k. Once the price broke through these two levels decisively, it was a very easy ride all the way up to $100k,” Consorti added. The current BTC bull run has led to Bitcoin backers like MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet announcing new BTC purchases . MicroStrategy now holds 1.5% of the asset’s total supply . Investors Will Take BTC Profits, Fueling A Full Crypto Bullrun Bitcoin breaking $100,000 also marks a significant turning point for both retail and institutional investors. Sergey Vasylchuk, CEO of global crypto staking platform Everstake, told Cryptonews that the $100,000 BTC mark demonstrates a psychological level where people will undoubtedly take BTC profits. However, Vasylchuk believes that many investors will not shy away from cryptocurrency. “Once you are addicted to crypto profit, you come back to seek more,” Vasylchuk said. He further believes that the crypto industry will see entry into Solana (SOL) or Ethereum (ETH) , which will fuel a full crypto bull run. “This bull run to 100,000 BTC is not the same narrative as past bullruns. This has been a BTC bullrun and not a full crypto bullrun,” said Vasylchuk. “We may even see another memecoin rally that pushes Solana to another rise or approval of an ETH ETF or pro-DeFi regulation that drives ETH up.” Joe Flanagan, Co-Founder of Maple Finance, also believes that as Bitcoin dominance stabilizes attention will shift to blue-chip decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens . What’s Next For Bitcoin? Industry experts predict that the new Bitcoin ATH will lead to increased growth within the crypto sector overall. Dennis Porter, CEO and Co-Founder of Satoshi Action Fund, told Cryptonews that the $100k BTC price will likely result in a massive surge of retail purchases. Tim Enneking, Founder and Principle of Digital Capital Management, told Cryptonews that Bitcoin breaking $100,000 indeed creates fear of missing out, or “FOMO” for retail investors. “The more valuable a single BTC becomes, the more it will have a significant effect on retail investors,” Enneking said. “The asset is also closer to becoming incorporated into different countries’ reserves.” Enneking added that the $100k Bitcoin price will not turn into permanent support for the asset. “If we get to $120,000 we may even see BTC drop back somewhere around $90k,” he remarked.

The milestone underscores Bitcoin’s growing acceptance in mainstream finance and the potential for broader institutional adoption. Investors are betting on Trump’s crypto-friendly policies, which aim to establish the US as a global leader in digital assets. Bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise this year, doubling its value and gaining 45% in the weeks since Trump’s election victory. When writing, Bitcoin traded at $102,302, up 6.64% from the previous session. Source: CoinMarketCap Market analysts attribute this surge to growing confidence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital told Reuters . “Institutional adoption, advancements in tokenization, and a clearer regulatory path are driving Bitcoin and digital assets toward financial mainstream acceptance.” Fed Chair Powell calls Bitcoin a competitor to gold Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has described Bitcoin as a competitor to gold , emphasizing its role in preserving monetary value rather than functioning as a currency. Speaking at the 2024 New York Times DealBook Summit, Powell highlighted the cryptocurrency’s characteristics and volatility. Bitcoin is more like gold, but in a virtual form. People aren’t using it as a payment method or a reliable store of value. “It’s not a competitor to the dollar; it’s more of a competitor to gold,” Powell added. Why is Bitcoin going up?

Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and crypto advocate, co-chairs the Token Alliance and works with the Chamber of Digital Commerce to develop best practices for digital asset issuance and trading platforms. His appointment is seen as a signal of the administration’s commitment to fostering innovation in the cryptocurrency space. BTC at $100K: will Bitcoin keep going up? Bitcoin’s rise to $100,000 marks a turning point in the cryptocurrency’s journey from a niche asset to a significant financial instrument. Industry experts highlight the role of institutional adoption and technological advancements in driving this growth. “Bitcoin crossing $100,000 isn’t just a number; it reflects a broader shift in global finance, technology, and geopolitics,” Justin D’Anethan, an independent crypto analyst based in Hong Kong was quoted as saying by Reuters. What was once dismissed as a fantasy is now a reality, underscoring Bitcoin’s resilience and relevance. The milestone comes more than 16 years after Bitcoin’s creation, a period marked by skepticism, regulatory challenges, and market volatility. Despite these obstacles, BTC has demonstrated staying power and adaptability.

Watch on Twitter View replies 8:24 AM · Dec 5, 2024 6 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Beyond surpassing the $100,000 milestone, optimism around Bitcoin’s future growth remains strong among institutions and prominent crypto personalities. New price targets range between $150,000 and $500,000 within the next few years, fueled by increasing institutional adoption and market momentum. Bernstein Research has revised its bullish price forecast for Bitcoin, projecting it to reach $200,000 by 2025. This updated target, previously set at $150,000, reflects the growing institutional demand for cryptocurrencies across various regions. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, is even more optimistic. He predicts Bitcoin’s price could soar to $250,000 within the next two years, considering it a conservative estimate. Hoskinson believes Bitcoin’s potential upper limit could reach as high as $500,000, driven by rapid adoption and expanding use cases. Bitcoin hits $100K: what this means for crypto markets Bitcoin’s rally is expected to have ripple effects across the broader cryptocurrency market. Altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple could see renewed interest as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Meanwhile, advancements in blockchain technology and tokenization could further integrate cryptocurrencies into traditional financial systems. With the US poised to take a leadership role in the digital asset ecosystem, the stage is set for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to continue their upward trajectory. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and the potential for reduced regulatory hurdles could drive further investment and innovation in the space. Bitcoin’s ascent past $100,000 is more than just a milestone; it’s a testament to its growing acceptance as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty. As geopolitical dynamics evolve and regulatory clarity improves, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape is likely to expand further.

Say Yes to This Layer 1 Blockchain with 53k% ROI Prospects,"The cryptocurrency market is heating up again, with Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge as one of the most celebrated projects in blockchain history. From its humble beginnings as an ICO in 2015 to becoming the backbone of decentralised finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum has carved its legacy. But if you’re feeling a little regret for not jumping in on Ethereum’s ICO when tokens were just $0.30 each, there’s some good news on the horizon. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain project making waves with a massive presale and an innovative ecosystem that aims to address gaps its predecessors left open. As the best crypto to buy before Christmas 2024 , Qubetics is not just another blockchain—it’s an ambitious project solving real-world problems through its powerful web3 aggregator and developer tools. If Ethereum is the grand architect of decentralised applications, Qubetics is the master planner poised to bring structure and usability to blockchain chaos. Here’s how these two projects stack up against each other. Ethereum (ETH): The Pioneer That Changed the Game Ethereum wasn’t just another cryptocurrency when it launched; it was a revolution. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum introduced smart contracts—self-executing agreements that run on its blockchain. This feature turned Ethereum into the go-to platform for developers and businesses looking to build decentralised applications (dApps). From DeFi platforms like Uniswap to NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Ethereum paved the way for blockchain innovation. Fast forward to 2024, Ethereum continues to dominate, but it’s not without its challenges. Network congestion and sky-high gas fees have been persistent issues, even after the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which replaced proof-of-work with proof-of-stake. Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum and Optimism, have alleviated some pressure, but scalability and affordability remain hot-button topics for developers and users alike. Despite its hurdles, Ethereum is still a powerhouse. As of December 2024, Ethereum trades at just under $2,000, with analysts predicting a climb to $3,000 in 2025 as the broader crypto market recovers. While Ethereum offers stability and proven utility, its growth potential is moderate compared to emerging projects like Qubetics. Why is Ethereum still a key player? It’s the original Layer 1 that unlocked a trillion-dollar market. However, as competition heats up, Ethereum might share the stage with newer, more focused projects like Qubetics that address its weaknesses. Qubetics ($TICS): The Next Big Thing with Groundbreaking ROI Qubetics isn’t here to play second fiddle. As the world’s first web3 aggregator, it offers a robust ecosystem for developers, businesses, and individual users. But what sets Qubetics apart is its application, QubeQode IDE, a development environment designed to make blockchain coding accessible to everyone—from seasoned developers to budding entrepreneurs. Imagine a freelance software developer juggling projects on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. With QubeQode IDE, they can write, test, and deploy smart contracts across multiple chains without switching platforms or tools. Now picture a small business looking to integrate blockchain for supply chain transparency. Qubetics simplifies the process, offering customisable templates and real-time analytics that make blockchain integration seamless. For individuals, Qubetics is equally transformative. Think of a digital artist looking to mint NFTs but overwhelmed by the complexity of multiple blockchain platforms. QubeQode IDE enables easy NFT creation and deployment, eliminating the technical barriers that deter creators from entering the blockchain space. The ongoing $TICS presale has already attracted over 6,200 holders, raising $4.3 million. With a current price of $0.0282, the potential upside is staggering. An investment of $100,000 at this stage would secure approximately 3.54 million $TICS tokens. By the presale’s end, when $TICS is projected to hit $0.25, that investment could balloon to $885,000—a 783% ROI. But it doesn’t stop there. Analysts predict $TICS could soar to $1 after the presale and $15 after its mainnet launch, translating into a jaw-dropping $53 million ROI. Why is Qubetics the best crypto to buy before Christmas 2024? It’s all about innovation and practicality. By bridging gaps left by Ethereum and other blockchains, Qubetics is shaping up to be the go-to platform for anyone looking to harness blockchain technology without the steep learning curve. Why Qubetics is the Way to Go for New Crypto Investors Both Ethereum and Qubetics have their strengths. Ethereum is the tried-and-true option, with a legacy that’s hard to beat. But for investors seeking exponential growth and fresh opportunities, Qubetics is the clear winner. Its focus on real-world applications, combined with its user-friendly developer tools and groundbreaking presale success, makes it a standout project in the blockchain landscape. So, what’s the takeaway? If you missed Ethereum’s ICO or have been hesitant to dive into crypto, Qubetics is your golden ticket. Its potential for massive ROI, coupled with its practical applications, makes it a no-brainer for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio.

With the BTC price achieving the $100,000 mark, the volatility in the cryptocurrency market has recorded a new high. Moreover, the altcoin market has experienced a significant increase, with top altcoins recording a mixed price sentiment. As the crypto market records a new high, is this a good time to stack altcoins to maximize future gains? In this article, we have covered the short-term possibilities of Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) crypto tokens.

Further, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is on the verge of experiencing a bullish crossover with it heading toward the overbought range in the 1D time frame. This suggests an increase in the buying pressure for the altcoin in the market. If the bullish sentiment sustains, the Ethereum price will head toward its resistance level of $4.5k.

XRP 05th Dec 2024 The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has recorded a constant green histogram, with its averages showing a significant rise in the 1D time frame. This suggests an increase in the buying-over-selling pressure. Maintaining its bullish action could push the XRP coin price toward its upper resistance level of $3.00.

Still, savvy investors are turning their gaze toward PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a project that promises an astonishing ROI of up to 20,000% by 2025. As the adoption of the AI and RWAs sector grows, the potential for significant returns is not just a dream but a tangible opportunity for those willing to embrace innovative blockchain solutions. PropiChain’s unique approach to real estate tokenization positions it as the perfect option for high ROI, challenging the Cardano price movements. Cardano Price Momentum to $2 Gathers Steam The Cardano price has recently captured headlines with its remarkable 223% surge over the past 30 days, pushing ADA to $1.15. This impressive growth stems from a series of impactful ecosystem upgrades and strategic partnerships, such as the launch of RLUSD in collaboration with Ripple and advancements in RWAs tokenization. These developments have fueled optimism among investors, setting the stage for a potential Cardano price to the $2 mark. Technical indicators reveal bullish momentum, with Cardano price breaking through multiple resistance zones. The RSI sits at 81.11, indicating overbought conditions and signaling strong buyer dominance. Experts predict the Cardano price will stabilize before pushing past $1.50, with the $2 target gaining traction as Bitcoin approaches $100,000. As Cardano uses its decentralized governance model and ecosystem expansions, it continues to establish itself as a robust contender in the blockchain space, paving the way for further Cardano price surges amidst an increasingly competitive market. PropiChain (PCHAIN) Pioneers RWA Tokenization for a 2025 Breakout PropiChain is not just another entrant in the blockchain ecosystem; it is a unique platform poised to transform the trillion-dollar real estate market. By combining cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, NFTs, AI, and the Metaverse, PropiChain is removing the barriers of traditional real estate systems. PropiChain’s innovation is its NFT-based fractional ownership system. Each property listed on the platform is tokenized as an NFT, which can be bought, sold, or traded easily. This feature democratizes access to high-value properties, allowing investors to own fractions of real estate that were previously out of reach. Users can acquire stakes in multiple properties by pooling resources with other investors, diversifying their portfolios, and improving market liquidity. This model not only makes real estate investment more accessible but also increases transparency, as all transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain. PropiChain uses artificial intelligence to optimize every aspect of real estate management. From predictive market analytics to automated transaction execution, AI improves investors’ decision-making processes. The platform also automates complex processes, such as executing transactions when specific conditions are met. Imagine setting a desired price for a property and having the AI complete the purchase when the price is right. This level of automation saves time and minimizes human error, improving user experience. PropiChain goes beyond traditional real estate platforms by integrating the Metaverse, offering immersive virtual tours of listed properties. This feature allows users to explore properties in a 3D environment, eliminating geographical barriers and enhancing the overall experience. Sellers benefit as well, using these virtual tools to present their properties more effectively, reaching a global audience without the need for physical visits. The Metaverse integration positions PropiChain as a pioneer in the next generation of real estate marketplaces, blending digital innovation with tangible assets. PropiChain’s use of blockchain technology provides unparalleled security for all transactions. Every property’s history and ownership details are stored in a decentralized ledger called the “Title Contract,” which mitigates risks like fraud and counterparty manipulation. Furthermore, smart contracts, audited by BlockAudit, automatically handle lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals. These features simplify property management for landlords while ensuring tenants enjoy transparent, hassle-free interactions. PCHAIN’s Presale: Join Now and Get a 1,600% ROI PropiChain’s presale offers a unique opportunity at $0.004 per token. Prices are projected to climb to $0.032 by the final stage, granting early investors access to a revolutionary platform with immense growth potential. Early investors in PCHAIN could see exponential growth, with $1,000 potentially yielding up to $16,000 ROI by 2025, far surpassing gains from established cryptos like Cardano, as the token gains traction from the recent CoinMarketCap listing and the RWAs market growth. In addition to high ROI, early participants will enjoy several benefits post-listing, including governance rights within the platform and access to premium tools designed for property investment. As investors weigh their options between the projected Cardano price surge and emerging projects like PropiChain, its innovative approach and significant growth potential make it attractive for those seeking substantial ROI in the coming years.

The state-run news agency TASS reported that the lawmaker and State Duma Energy Committee member Boris Gladkikh sent a letter to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova on the matter. Block Crypto Miners from Using Subsidized Power, Urges MP Gladkikh’s letter reportedly includes a request that the government “deprive” miners of access to “preferential electricity tariffs.” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Source: government.ru [CC BY 4.0] Gladkikh noted that “interest in crypto mining is growing rapidly” in Russia. And he said that mining “is sometimes carried out using subsidized electricity rates provided by the state.” The lawmaker said that “when miners pay for electricity at reduced rates or through subsidies,” this “results not only in economic losses, but also in negative social consequences.” “We propose making appropriate changes to the current legislation. The government should cancel [energy] benefits for [miners].” Russian lawmaker Boris Gladkikh Europe is set for the coldest winter since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, pushing up energy costs as the continent dips into its gas reserves at a faster-than-usual rate https://t.co/1pUqncCQOs — Bloomberg (@business) November 27, 2024 Russia operates a complicated system of energy benefits and subsidies, with much of the population allowed to pay lower residential rates for power. This year, however, Russian regions have started to switch to differentiated electricity tariffs. Consumers are classed into three groups: preferential users, “economically justified” users, and commercial customers. Industrial miners must pay the highest of these three rates. However, the situation for home-based crypto miners is more complex. Russian lawmaker and State Duma Energy Committee member Boris Gladkikh. (Source: Rossiya24/Screenshot) Power Usage Threshold Set This year, Moscow has ruled that most private miners do not need to declare their operations or earnings, provided they do not exceed power usage thresholds of 6,000 kWh per month . However, in some regions, miners could realistically stay within this threshold while still paying “preferential tariffs” on their power. Gladkikh’s proposal appears to call for an end to this, with the MP calling on the state to block crypto miners from accessing these subsidies. However, such a plan would likely face serious challenges. The UK government expanded its sanctions against Russia’s energy industry on Monday, blacklisting dozens of tankers as well as two insurers https://t.co/i3AMSHnOUh — Bloomberg (@business) November 25, 2024 The popularity of crypto mining is ballooning in Russia, where mining hardware is now selling at its fastest rate since the start of the year. Illegal crypto mining is also on the rise, with many miners tapping directly into electrical grids to power their rigs . Power providers claim this is causing major shortages in many areas. But even miners who do not use illegal connections could prove hard to track down if the government decides to accept Gladkikh’s proposal.

The price of BTC has jumped to a high of $101,349 at time of publishing, up 5.5% in the last 24 hours. BTC’s historic push above six-figures comes after this year’s explosive launch of Bitcoin ETFs and last month’s billion-dollar launch of Bitcoin ETF options. Collectively, US-based Bitcoin ETFs have now amassed more than $110 billion in BTC, according to the crypto data aggregator Coinglass. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is the fastest growing of all-time, and is already larger than BlackRock’s gold ETF – despite the gold ETF’s 19 year head-start. After hitting Wall Street, the big question is what’s next for Bitcoin in Washington, D.C. In his campaign, President-elect Trump pledged his administration will strategically hold Bitcoin that the US has collected from criminal cases, instead of selling its crypto on the open market. He also promised to implement policies that solidify crypto self-custody and grow the industry at large. Trump’s picks for Treasury Secretary and SEC Chair, Scott Bessent and Paul Atkins, are both crypto-friendly, in an early sign of the coming shift to the US government’s posture towards digital assets. Meanwhile, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis is touting her proposal to create a national Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. In a recent interview with CNBC, Lummis says she believes the government should sell some of its exposure to gold to buy BTC. “We have reserves at our 12 Federal Reserve Banks, including gold certificates, that could be converted to current fair market value. They’re held at their 1970’s values on the books, and then [we can] sell them into Bitcoin. That way, we wouldn’t have to use any new dollars in order to establish this reserve.” Bitcoin’s rise from total obscurity at launch in 2009 to six figures per BTC makes it increasingly difficult to argue against the digital asset’s use case as a global protocol for wealth preservation and accumulation. The asset’s success is due to many factors including its so-called immaculate conception – created by an unknown person or team who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto and disappeared without taking profit. The Bitcoin network operates on a set of core technological features and financial principals that fuel its growth including a limited supply, decentralized security, easy transactability and cryptographic self-custody. Bitcoin’s current market cap stands at $2,005,100,870,839. That’s larger than the market caps of Tesla, Meta, Silver and Saudi Aramco. Six assets on Earth are now larger than Bitcoin, with gold in first place at $18 trillion, followed by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

Over $25K locked within hours on new BCH L1 stablecoin ‘Moria’,"The Bitcoin Cash network now has an experimental, native-backed, over-collateralized stablecoin called “Moria” (MUSD). Within about one day, the decentralized, open-source protocol has seen over $25,000 locked on the network, with transactions occurring directly on-chain. As Cryptopolitan previously reported, smart contracts comparable to Ethereum can now be executed directly on the Bitcoin Cash chain via the May 2023 CashTokens upgrade . This upgrade enabled UTXO (unspent transaction output)-based smart contracts for minimal fees. In everyday language, it means cheap transactions can be done on layer 1, and not on a “second layer solution” like the Lightning Network (with BTC) or Rollups (on ETH). While development on the framework is still in the early stages, this functionality is something mainstream crypto has been sleeping on, and could become a fierce competitor to those entities currently ruling crypto markets, like USDT. Native-backed stablecoin experiment launches on BCH Just yesterday, bitcoin cashers got their first taste of the stablecoin world via the 2023 upgrade, with the launch of a token called “ Moria ” (MUSD) on December 4. Moria was created by Riften Labs, the company behind the Cauldron DEX (decentralized exchange), also made possible by the aforementioned upgrade. Moria protocol stats as of 8:46 a.m., December 5 (JST). “The Moria Protocol is an experimental DeFi platform built on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, enabling users to mint decentralized stablecoins backed by BCH,” the Test Run #1 Overview notes, emphasizing: “This test run will end no later than May 2025 and will conclude with a sunset mechanism.” In essence, users can mint the asset by depositing BCH via the contract, resulting in MUSD tokens which are over-collateralized by BCH, and tied to the US dollar’s stability. “The test aims to evaluate whether MUSD can maintain a price stability close to that of USD,” the overview notes. This way, bitcoin cash can be effectively moved around with less worries about market volatility. Moria USD on the Cauldron Bitcoin Cash-native DEX. Riften Labs specifies that “When a loan becomes undercollateralized due to market swings—such as a drop in the BCH price lowering the value of the collateral—all loans in this state become available for liquidation by other users,” continuing, “Liquidators repay the loan using MUSD, unlocking the collateral, which is then released to the liquidator.” “To avoid liquidation, users must maintain a healthy collateralization ratio above the required threshold of 110%,” the overview cautions. Moria is just one of many experiments currently being undertaken permissionlessly via the CashTokens upgrade. It should be reiterated, as noted on the protocol exchange, that the current version of MUSD is highly experimental. The overview describes the end of the run, and next steps, detailing: “Upon completion, the protocol will transition to a new test run or into its finalized deployment, using the same ticker, while the current ticker will be renamed ‘MUSDv0.'” Moria vs Tether’s USDT The world of stablecoins has exploded in the last ten years, with controversial behemoths like Tether (USDT) massively shoving the crypto market this way and that. So, what’s the difference between Tether and this new experiment? Well, for one, more transparency via open source code . As S&P Global Ratings recently noted : “USDT’s smart contract source code is not open source, unlike that of most other stablecoins.” Further, the stable is backed by bitcoin cash (BCH), the native asset of the chain, and not a mixed bag of U.S. Treasuries and other investments shrouded in mystery and murky legalese. Finally, transactions via the Moria protocol aim to be censorship resistant and fully auditable, whereas Tether centrally freezes addresses flagged by governments. Still, not everyone in the BCH community thinks a stablecoin is necessary, and many view the idea of trying to peg to the violence-backed USD as harmful. Moria’s $26,000 in TVL (total-value locked) will likely be scoffed at by fans of the $135 billion-dollar USDT juggernaut, but the key point they’d be missing is that now anyone and everyone can build on BCH as on Ethereum, but for much less in terms of transactions costs thanks to the UTXO efficiency advantage.

37234762,https://coinpedia.org/?p=384092,1733367178,"Bitcoin Hits $100K , But 30% Correction Is Expected in Next 4-8 Weeks","The post Bitcoin Hits $100K , But 30% Correction Is Expected in Next 4-8 Weeks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin market is in a highly bullish phase, with many believing it could soon cross the $100K milestone. Investors are riding a wave of optimism as Bitcoin has surged by 45.65% since November 5, while the Altcoin market has seen an equally impressive rise of 46.57%. It seems the market is unstoppable—or there is a correction incoming? Bitcoin is charging towards $100,000, up 0.99% since yesterday, and still holding strong with a 59.23% dominance. However, a slight dip in trading volume shows traders are both bullish and cautious. Looking at the market scenario, Ran Neuner predicts that after Bitcoin hits the $100,000 mark, it will likely experience a correction, potentially dropping to between $75,000 and $80,000. He believes this pullback can happen within the next four to eight weeks, driven by the typical volatility that characterizes Bitcoin’s bull markets. This price dip may reflect the past cycles, where corrections followed major Bitcoin price surges. Is this your chance to buy the dip, before the BTC touches new highs? Let’s understand. Preparing for the Dip Neuner is gearing up for a potential Bitcoin correction by strategically adjusting his portfolio. He plans to hold 30% in cash, which will provide him the flexibility to buy during the anticipated market dip. Alongside this, he is reducing his leveraged positions and trading exposure, opting to focus on preserving his core Bitcoin holdings. This approach aims to minimize risks while positioning him to capitalize on opportunities during a pullback. He expects Bitcoin to face a 25-30% correction after reaching the $100,000 milestone, which aligns with patterns seen in previous market cycles such as 2016-17 and 2020-21. Historically, Bitcoin’s sharp corrections are a natural part of its growth trajectory, often followed by strong recoveries. Plus, Neuner highlights that altcoins typically rally when Bitcoin cools off after a major surge, as investors often redirect profits into smaller-cap tokens. With Bitcoin surging above the $100,000 level, he anticipates a similar trend this time, presenting a unique opportunity for altcoin investments at discounted prices. Despite the expected short-term volatility, Neuner remains optimistic about the crypto market’s long-term potential, fueled by regulatory shifts and investor sentiment, making this pullback a strategic buying moment. Good time to Invest in Altcoins? Overall, Neuner is optimistic about the future of crypto, even though he expects a short-term correction. He believes that in the next four years, the market will see strong growth due to changes in regulations and a shift in U.S. policies that favor crypto. Neuner sees the correction as a chance to buy altcoins at lower prices and remains confident in the long-term potential of the crypto market despite short-term ups and downs.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-hits-100k-but-30-correction-is-expected-in-next-4-8-weeks/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

As Bitcoin has now crossed $100K, it’s likely altcoins will take a break. As long as Bitcoin stays above support, we could see a potential rise towards $102K, based on a 100% extension target. This level isn’t set in stone, but it’s a key level to watch. If Bitcoin breaks above this, it might even push towards $110K, although there are many possible scenarios. The support zone around $99K is crucial. Bitcoin needs to stay above the 50% retracement level for this move to hold. If the price drops below $96,885, it could signal weakness and may lead to a pullback. Why is Bitcoin Rallying? The excitement surrounding Bitcoin is fueled by the hope that Trump will bring a more crypto-friendly environment, including better regulation and the possibility of a national reserve or stockpile. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin ETFs have also surpassed $1 billion in assets, which should drive more demand as institutions become more comfortable with the asset. These institutions could further boost Bitcoin’s price. Conclusion: Bitcoin has been making headlines with its fast appreciation, but even when prices drop, it’s important to stay focused on the bigger picture. The recent price drop after hitting $99,000 didn’t last long, and as of now, it’s close to that high again. Looking ahead, Bitcoin could become an even bigger part of global financial systems, with more institutions, countries, and companies investing in it. As Bitcoin moves beyond the $100,000 mark, it could attract even more attention, and the financial world may see Bitcoin integrated into more investment products.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-breaks-historic-100k-mark-surges-beyond-101k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Now ahead about 130% year-to-date, bitcoin's market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2 trillion only 15 years after coming into existence. For reference, Nvidia and Apple sport market caps of about $3.5 trillion, Microsoft $3 trillion, and Google and Amazon $2.2 trillion. The market capitalization of all the gold in the world is roughly $17.7 trillion.    At the forefront of this rally was the early-2024 launch of spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) by asset management giants including BlackRock and Fidelity. These products have been a resounding success, securing assets under management of around $30 billion in less than one year's time.  Despite the success of the ETFs, the move higher in bitcoin seemingly stalled throughout a large chunk of this year, at least in part thanks to regulatory uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election. The early November victory of crypto-friendly Donald Trump, though, spurred new legs for the rally, with bitcoin quickly taking out its March high above $73,500, then in fast time moving past $80,000, then $90,000, and finally $100,000 just minutes ago.

It’s small compared to the up-to-infinite price levels that succeed it. While $100,000 is a significant milestone worth pausing to recognize, it is also merely a checkpoint on Bitcoin ’s much longer, much larger journey ahead. Let’s take a moment to remember the early moments of this journey. The year Kraken was founded (2011), Bitcoin’s Dec. 31 closing price was $4.25. From that level, the value of just one of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist is now up over 2.3 million percent at BTC $100,000. BTC $100,000 has long been viewed as the next/seemingly “final” frontier for Bitcoin’s price . Laser eyes and dank memes, as well as innovative products and user experiences, have accelerated us to this point. Through years of speculation around “the world to be when Bitcoin reaches $100,000,” a common sentiment held that the $100,000 price level would somehow confer the legitimacy of “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.” It would show the value of a tamper-resistant and immutable way of recording information. It would prove that decentralization had a place in modern society. But, now that we are here, those goals may seem as if they still have more to deliver. It feels like this is still only the beginning. We’ve reached a pricing milestone, but when it comes to fulfilling Satoshi’s original vision for Bitcoin – its widespread use as a borderless, worldwide peer-to-peer electronic cash system – Bitcoin is still in its relative infancy. Over the short term, it’s anyone’s guess whether the price of Bitcoin will continue its sprint higher or pull back from its recent run. What is clear is that the $100,000 milestone demonstrates ongoing demand for a reliable, transparent and peer-to-peer way to transact . BTC $100,000 represents a monumental milestone in Kraken’s mission to accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency, so that everyone can achieve financial freedom and inclusion. We’d like to congratulate those who have built in the space alongside us and played a role in realizing this achievement. We’d also like to congratulate our clients as they celebrate this watershed moment, while making a commitment to serve them through the next chapters of Bitcoin’s history .

37234107,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=657138,1733365856,Hedera Breakthrough Moment: HBAR Rockets Over 800% – Details,"The native coin of Hedera Hashgraph, HBAR, is the talk of the cryptocurrency market following an impressive price ascent. In a matter of four weeks, the coin reversed a bearish trend that had persisted for more than 1,000 days. With increased investor interest, experts are piling on the lofty price predictions, suggesting a rise in faith in this enterprise-grade public ledger. Related Reading: Cardano Rally Heats Up: Experts See 750% Jump Ahead The price of HBAR was $0.3173 at the time of writing. Even though the coin lost 10% in the last 24 hours, it did very well over the course of a week and a month. Notably, HBAR has maintained a huge 801% rally over the last 30 days, which has made buyers very happy. What’s driving this momentum? A combination of innovative upgrades, partnerships, and market optimism. HBAR’s rebound is more than just a price spike—it’s a transformation in how the project is positioned in the blockchain space. Aggressive Targets In The Bull Market Experts have projected a hopeful $5 for HBAR as the bull market for cryptocurrencies keeps up. A more conservative $2.50 shows great growth potential if the market peaks in April 2025. This positive attitude is not founded in conjecture alone. Hedera is getting ready for major announcements including a new privacy layer that will let consumers construct private network instances while still linked to the public ledger. Dr. Leemon Baird, co-founder of Hedera, believes that this privacy layer has the potential to change areas such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. Hedera addresses significant gaps in blockchain technology by providing organizations with a safe yet interoperable solution. Ripple Partnership Boosts HBAR Adoption Hedera’s increasing integration with blockchain-based payment systems is another motivator. The technology, via Dropp, plays an important part in the Federal Reserve’s FedNow system, allowing for rapid and safe transactions. Moreover, its interaction with Ripple (XRP) proves it to be a strong rival in USD transaction handling. The likely certification of the RLUSD stablecoin by Ripple in December could help HBAR’s position in the payments ecosystem to be strengthened, therefore promoting acceptance in many sectors.

A substantial upgrade is on the way, potentially raising transaction throughput to 500,000 transactions per second (TPS).

Still, experts like Javon Marks are hopeful, projecting a rise to $0.504, almost three times its current worth. Open interest in HBAR trading rose 28% to $187 million. Capital inflows indicate increased confidence, suggesting the HBAR rise may continue. Hedera’s progress should be monitored by investors and enthusiasts.

Ripple Labs’s popular token XRP ( XRP ) has seen a major decrease of 12% to $127 billion in market capitalization in just a day of trading. In contrast, this token became the most trending coin of November after surging 344% in a month, outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ) by just 44% in the same period. 1 Hour XRP price chart, December 05, 2024 | Source: crypto.news According to CoinMarketCap data on Dec. 05, at the time of writing, the token position now tu rned down and brought Tether’s USDT back to the third rank with a market cap of $135 billion.

The volume of trading also recorded a decrease of up to 46% to $23.28 billion.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA.

37240164,https://invezz.com/?p=2369524,1733364120,"Crypto price predictions: Compound, Status, iDEGEN","Cryptocurrency prices were upbeat on Thursday morning as Bitcoin surged above $100,000 for the first time ever. Analysts expect that most coins will continue rising in the next few weeks as the Santa Claus Rally takes shape. This report looks at top coins like Compound (COMP), Status (SNT), and iDEGEN. Compound price analysis The daily chart shows that the COMP price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few weeks. It has now jumped above the important resistance level at $103.2, the upper side of the cup and handle pattern. C&H is one of the most popular patterns in the market. Compound has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossed each other. Also, the MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have continued rising, a sign that there is a strong momentum. Therefore, with Bitcoin price sitting above $100,000, there is a likelihood that the COMP price will continue rising as bulls target the next key resistance point at $200. This bullish view will become invalid if the Compound price drops below the support at $103. iDEGEN analysis Unlike Compound, iDEGEN is not a publicly-traded coin. Instead, it is an upcoming crypto project currently in its presale event. It has already sold over 415 million tokens valued at over $2.3 million, making it one of the fastest-growing token sales this year. The token will be listed on January 1st next year. There are a few reasons why the iDEGEN price will likely do well after its listing. First, we are now in the altcoin season, where most coins thrive. A good example of this is what happened in 2021 when Shiba Inu and most meme coins jumped. Second, the iDEGEN network has a strong community support as millions of people have bought the coin. This means that it could become the next popular coin as we saw with popular coins like Floki and Shiba Inu. Further, its tokenomics favor the community as 90% of the tokens are going to them and 10% to liquidity. You can buy the iDEGEN token here . Status price analysis The Status token price has done well in the past few months. In this, it has jumped above the key resistance level at $0.0667, the upper side of the cup and handle pattern. Status has also rallied above all moving averages, while all oscillators have pointed upwards. The coin has also moved above the Ichimoku cloud indicator, meaning that bulls are in control for now. Therefore, the Status token will likely continue rising as bulls target the next important resistance at $0.10. A drop below the support at $0.066 will invalidate the bullish view.

If confirmed, Isaacman will become NASA’s 15th administrator, succeeding Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat. Isaacman is the CEO of Shift4, a fintech company that processes over $260 billion annually for more than 200,000 clients. He is also recognized for his collaboration with Elon Musk and SpaceX, a key commercial partner of NASA. In 2021, Isaacman financed and led the Inspiration4 mission, a private spaceflight aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon Resilience. He returned to space in September 2024 as commander of the Polaris Dawn mission, where he became the first private citizen to perform a “spacewalk.” Extensive Aviation and Business Background Before his space ventures, Isaacman was a certified pilot for various civilian and military aircraft, even flying in stunt formations as part of an aeronautical team. In the business realm, Isaacman co-founded Draken International, a defense aerospace company and U.S. Department of Defense contractor. Trump highlighted this experience in his Truth Social announcement, describing him as a dynamic leader in both business and aerospace. “I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Jared will drive NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in space science, technology, and exploration,” Trump stated. Part of a Broader Transition Strategy Isaacman’s nomination comes amidst other major appointments by the Trump transition team.

Every day brings new opportunities, innovative technologies, and game-changing updates that could redefine the space. Staying ahead of the curve means spotting the gems before they shine—and that’s where today’s story begins. While Cardano’s latest bullish trend has traders buzzing and Bitcoin inches closer to a jaw-dropping $100,000 milestone, there’s a new player quietly making waves: Qubetics ($TICS). Positioned as a game-changer for blockchain development, Qubetics is already turning heads with its powerful tools and a presale that’s generating serious excitement. This article dives into all three coins—Qubetics, Cardano, and Bitcoin—but focuses on why Qubetics is a top crypto to invest in this week. Let’s break it down. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Development with Innovation At the heart of Qubetics is its revolutionary QubeQode IDE, a development platform that’s a dream for beginners and seasoned blockchain developers. This isn’t just another IDE; it’s a fully visual environment that lets users build blockchain applications without breaking a sweat. Imagine drag-and-drop functionality for creating features like token management or user authentication. You don’t need to be a coding wizard—intuitive forms let you easily define logic and parameters, while a code snippet library provides ready-made solutions for complex tasks. And it doesn’t stop there. Qubetics integrates AI-driven development tools that turbocharge your workflow. Think smart contract generation tailored to your needs, instant code suggestions, error detection, and even optimisation tips for better performance and security. Whether you’re a startup founder or a hobbyist exploring blockchain, Qubetics makes development fast, efficient, and approachable. Recently, Qubetics hosted an AMA session packed with insights about its roadmap, features, and community-driven focus. With tools like these, it’s no wonder Qubetics is being hailed as the top crypto to invest in this week. Cardano: Bullish Momentum in Action Cardano is showing impressive strength, riding a bullish channel that’s caught traders’ attention. The ADA/USD pair recently bounced off $0.80, hinting at growing accumulation and setting the stage for a breakout. The pivotal moment? A golden cross, where the 50-period SMA moved above the 200-period SMA, confirming a sustained uptrend. With these moving averages acting as dynamic support, Cardano’s price action looks poised for continued growth. Moments like these keep it among the top cryptos, especially for traders seeking technical-driven opportunities. Bitcoin Nears $100K Amid Speculation of Crypto-Friendly Policies Bitcoin is once again flirting with historic highs, trading just shy of $100,000. The recent surge—over 40% since November 5—comes as President-elect Donald Trump pledges to reverse restrictive policies on digital assets. The idea of the U.S. becoming a global hub for crypto, combined with talks of a strategic national Bitcoin reserve, has fueled investor confidence. However, not everyone’s convinced. Some analysts argue that Trump’s staunch support for the U.S. dollar could limit these ambitions. Still, the excitement is palpable with Bitcoin’s price within striking distance of six figures. It’s no surprise it remains a top crypto for those looking to ride the momentum. Qubetics Presale Soars: The Top Crypto to Watch Now Here’s where the real excitement lies: Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 11, with $TICS tokens priced at just $0.028. Each weekly phase brings a 10% price hike, and the final stage promises a 20% surge, so getting in early could mean huge rewards. The presale has already raised over $4.3 million, signalling strong community interest and confidence. Now, let’s talk about potential. Analysts predict that if $TICS were to hit $10, a modest $200 investment could balloon to a staggering $70,689.80, delivering an ROI of 35,244.90%. And if $TICS climbs even further to $15, that same investment would soar to $106,034.70, an ROI of 52,917.35%. Imagine the possibilities—this is why so many are calling Qubetics one of the top cryptos to invest in this week . If you’re waiting for the perfect time, this is it. Don’t let the next big opportunity pass you by. Conclusion: Qubetics Steals the Spotlight Each of these cryptos offers a compelling story. Cardano’s bullish channel highlights its technical potential, while Bitcoin’s climb toward $100K reflects growing market optimism and policy shifts. But Qubetics stands apart. With its cutting-edge tools, AI-driven development, and a presale that’s turning heads, it’s not just another token—it’s an opportunity to shape the future of blockchain. If you’re searching for the top crypto to invest in this week, Qubetics is the clear standout. Don’t just watch from the sidelines—join the presale and be part of something groundbreaking. Time is ticking, and so are the price hikes. Are you in?

37232732,https://nulltx.com/?p=135177,1733363118,Invest in Qubetics Today as Price Increases Weekly—Best Crypto Opportunity Amid Toncoin’s Mainstream Push and EOS’s Momentum,"Have you noticed how some cryptocurrencies are redefining the future of finance while others fizzle out? Recently, Toncoin and EOS have grabbed attention with their strong comebacks, setting benchmarks in scalability and adoption. Toncoin is riding high after its seamless integration with Telegram’s Web3 wallet, while EOS has surged thanks to a major tokenomics overhaul. But the real question is, can these projects keep up with the growing demands of the digital economy? Qubetics ($TICS) is a blockchain project transforming the cross-border payment landscape, addressing challenges like high fees, delays, and lack of transparency. By tackling these inefficiencies head-on, it is solving real-world financial issues that have often been overlooked. With its presale now in the 11th stage, Qubetics offers investors an exciting opportunity to secure early-stage returns with significant growth potential. Here’s a closer look at how these altcoins compare. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Cross-Border Payments With Speed, Security, and Affordability Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a practical solution for global financial challenges. Picture a small business owner in Los Angeles importing artisan goods from Europe. Traditional payment methods would mean waiting days for transfers and losing profits to high bank fees and currency conversions. Qubetics offers instant settlements, drastically reducing delays and costs. Now think about freelancers. A graphic designer in Toronto working for clients in Singapore can skip the headaches of delayed international wire transfers. Payments are processed swiftly and securely through Qubetics’ blockchain-based system, improving cash flow and client satisfaction. Families sending remittances? They can rely on the platform to make sure their hard-earned money reaches loved ones fast, without burning a hole in their wallets. With transparency, speed, and affordability at its core, Qubetics transforms how people and businesses move money globally. If you’re curious about its functionality, check out this video for more insights. Why Qubetics Presale Is the Talk of the Town The Qubetics presale is more than just an investment; it’s an opportunity. Now in its 11th stage, over 266 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $4.3 million from 6,200 holders. At $0.0282 per token, the presale offers an entry point that’s hard to ignore. Each week, the price increases by 10%, with the next stage starting Sunday at midnight. What makes this even more exciting are the returns. Analysts predict that by the end of the presale, $TICS will be priced at $0.25—a whopping 783% ROI. Post-presale, the token is expected to hit $1 (3,434% ROI) and could soar to $15 after the mainnet launch, offering an eye-watering 52,912% ROI. For example, if someone invests $2,000 now, they could see their investment grow to $105,824 if these projections hold true. Toncoin Keeps Growing Its Ecosystem Toncoin, the powerhouse behind The Open Network, is leveraging its ties to Telegram to create a massive Web3 ecosystem. With over 700 million active Telegram users potentially engaging with its Web3 wallet, Toncoin is set for mainstream adoption. The token has already seen a 27% price jump since late November, bringing its market cap to a hefty $15.3 billion. This surge reflects not just market confidence but also Toncoin’s ability to scale efficiently for decentralised apps and financial tools. If this trajectory continues, Toncoin could soon breach the $10 mark, cementing its place as one of the best altcoins to invest in now. EOS Bounces Back With New Upgrades EOS, a blockchain once declared dead by critics, is proving the doubters wrong with its latest updates.

37234300,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51353,1733363112,"Why Qubetics, Polkadot, and Bittensor TAO Are the Best Altcoins To Join for Innovation and Long-Term Gains","Cryptocurrency markets are constantly evolving, and it’s no secret that savvy investors are always on the lookout for the best altcoins to join now. Polkadot has been making headlines with its cutting-edge scalability and decentralised solutions. Meanwhile, Bittensor TAO is gaining traction for pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence on blockchain. But there’s another name emerging as a true game-changer: Qubetics ($TICS) . What makes Qubetics unique is its focus on tokenisation and real-world solutions, setting it apart from its competitors. Whether you’re a tech entrepreneur or an everyday investor, Qubetics’ tokenised asset marketplace promises unmatched accessibility and growth potential. Plus, with its presale offering jaw-dropping ROI predictions, this project demands attention from anyone serious about diversifying their portfolio. How Qubetics Reinvents Real World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics is taking asset tokenisation to a whole new level. Imagine a world where you can fractionally own a piece of real estate, intellectual property, or even fine art without navigating complex intermediaries. That’s exactly what Qubetics offers with its tokenised asset marketplace. Leveraging blockchain technology, the platform democratises ownership, allowing investors to access exclusive opportunities previously limited to the wealthy elite. Take, for instance, a small investor interested in the commercial real estate market. Traditionally, they would face insurmountable barriers, from hefty capital requirements to lengthy paperwork. With Qubetics, they can invest fractionally, owning a share in a lucrative property for as little as the price of a single token. This access unlocks new avenues for wealth creation without the usual hassles. The marketplace also brings transparency and liquidity to previously illiquid markets. Picture an entrepreneur looking to trade tokenised intellectual property rights. Instead of negotiating opaque agreements, they can list their tokenised assets on Qubetics’ marketplace and attract a global pool of buyers in real-time. This ease of use fosters financial inclusivity, making Qubetics an indispensable player among the best altcoins to join now. For more insights into the Qubetics marketplace, you can watch this informative video . If you’re considering the best altcoins to join now, Qubetics is an opportunity worth exploring. Why Qubetics Presale Offers Unmatched Potential Currently in its 11th presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 266 million $TICS tokens , raising a staggering $4.3 million. Tokens are priced at $0.0282, with a 10% price hike set for the upcoming 12th stage. Every presale stage lasts seven days, ending Sunday at midnight, ensuring consistent upward momentum. Now let’s talk about the returns. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by presale end , translating into a 783% ROI. Post-presale projections are even more ambitious, with $TICS expected to climb to $1, $5, and $15 in subsequent stages. For example, a $4,500 investment at the current price secures approximately 159,574 tokens. At $15 post-mainnet launch, that investment could balloon to $2,393,610. Polkadot Continues to Lead in Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot has cemented its position as a leader in blockchain interoperability, and recent updates prove it isn’t slowing down. The protocol has expanded its parachain ecosystem, with over 40 parachains actively contributing to its decentralised network. These parachains bring unique functionalities to Polkadot, from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces, enhancing its utility for developers and users alike. According to recent reports, Polkadot’s daily active users have grown by over 18% in the past month, reaching new heights in engagement. This surge coincides with its Kusama test network’s successful rollout of enhanced governance features, a testament to Polkadot’s innovation. Polkadot’s staking mechanism also deserves a mention. With an annual yield of 14%, staking has become a go-to choice for investors looking to maximise returns while supporting network security. For anyone searching for the best altcoins to join now, Polkadot offers both technological sophistication and attractive investment opportunities. Bittensor TAO Revolutionises Blockchain-Based Artificial Intelligence Bittensor TAO is rewriting the rulebook for blockchain and AI integration. As decentralised AI networks become the next frontier, Bittensor is ahead of the curve, allowing users to monetise their contributions to AI model training. The project has seen a 22% increase in active validators this quarter, underlining its growing traction among blockchain enthusiasts. One of Bittensor’s standout features is its staking model, which incentivises long-term participation. Recent updates revealed that its network processed over 1.2 million transactions last month, reflecting its robust scalability. Additionally, TAO token holders are reaping the benefits of an impressive annual yield of 12%, making it a solid pick for investors focused on passive income. In terms of adoption, partnerships with research institutions and AI startups are positioning Bittensor as a leader in its niche. Whether you’re an AI developer or an investor eyeing the best altcoins to join now, Bittensor TAO is worth considering for its innovative approach and growing ecosystem. Why These Altcoins Should Be on Your Radar The cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, and projects like Qubetics, Polkadot, and Bittensor TAO exemplify the industry’s potential for innovation and growth. While Polkadot leads in interoperability and Bittensor redefines decentralised AI, Qubetics stands out with its tokenised asset marketplace and promising presale returns.

37232917,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622496,1733363040,Why Analysts Are Calling This Blockchain Token Smarter Than Solana in December,"As December 2024 unfolds, analysts are turning their attention to a blockchain project that’s quickly gaining momentum: Lightchain AI . This innovative platform is being hailed as “smarter” than Solana , with its unique approach to combining artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Priced at just $0.002 during its presale , Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a leader in the next wave of decentralized innovation, attracting both enterprise clients and retail investors alike.

Solana’s Strengths and Challenges Solana has long been a market leader, praised for its ability to handle 65,000 transactions per second with low fees. Its focus on speed and developer-friendly infrastructure has made it a popular choice for DeFi and NFT projects. What Solana Does Well: High Performance: Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) consensus ensures fast, low-cost transactions. Expanding Ecosystem: With a growing number of DeFi, NFT, and gaming projects, Solana remains a hub of blockchain activity. Developer Adoption: Solana’s tools and resources make it a preferred platform for building decentralized applications. However, Solana’s focus on speed comes at a cost. Network outages and scalability challenges have left room for competitors like Lightchain AI to step in with smarter, more versatile solutions.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO.

This move is part of Trump’s broader goal to create a more crypto-friendly environment, a message that has been well received by the digital currency community. Atkins’ nomination is seen as a strategic choice to replace Gary Gensler, the current SEC chair, who has faced criticism for his strict regulations on the $3.5 trillion crypto market. Trump, a vocal supporter of crypto, expressed his excitement for Atkins’ nomination on his Truth Social platform, calling him a leader who supports common-sense regulations and understands the importance of digital assets in the country’s economy. “Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,” Trump said as he made the big announcement.

Neiro had a lot of promise with its bold vision and rapidly growing community, but for those who couldn’t get in early, it might feel like the ship had already sailed. Fortunately, there’s still hope— BTFD Coin is offering a second chance for anyone who missed out. With its incredibly strong presale performance and a chance to grab it at the current price of $0.000064, BTFD Coin is your opportunity to make a comeback and position yourself for massive gains in 2025. Let’s take a closer look at both Neiro and BTFD Coin to understand what makes BTFD Coin such an irresistible second chance. Neiro: The Meme Coin with High Hopes Neiro’s ICO raised some serious eyebrows. With a bold narrative, a flashy community, and promising tokenomics, it felt like it could be the next big meme coin to take the world by storm. The early stages of the ICO saw over $2.5 million in funds raised, and the project drew significant attention for its viral marketing tactics and community-driven approach. It seemed like everyone was on board with Neiro—its catchy branding and innovative use of blockchain tech created FOMO in the market, making it one of the most talked-about coins of 2024. However, for those who couldn’t secure their spot in the presale or ICO, it’s been a bit of a waiting game. The price surged quickly, and as expected, the volatility of meme coins took its toll. Some early holders made huge returns, while others are holding out for bigger gains. If you belong to neither group, you might feel like an outsider waiting for the next big shot. Well, don’t fret just yet. BTFD Coin: Your Chance at Financial Redemption Here’s where BTFD Coin comes into play. If you missed out on Neiro, now’s your time to strike back with a new opportunity that is already showing massive potential. BTFD Coin’s presale has been nothing short of impressive, with over $900,000 raised, and the presale is still going strong. Over 21 billion BTFD coins have already been sold, and more than 2,000 investors have hopped on board, forming the foundation of what’s shaping up to be a thriving community. Unlike other meme coins that rely heavily on hype, BTFD Coin has a more comprehensive roadmap that goes beyond just ‘buying the dip’. The project is community-driven, has a solid utility plan, and offers features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and high staking rewards. For those who missed out on the frenzy of Neiro, BTFD Coin is poised to deliver the next wave of exciting opportunities for investors. Investment Opportunity: How a $3,000 Investment Could Pay Off Let’s break down what a $3,000 investment in BTFD Coin could look like. At the current presale price of $0.000064, your $3,000 would buy you 46,875,000 BTFD coins. If the price rises to just $0.0006—a conservative estimate considering the current momentum—that investment could grow to $28,125. That’s a potential return of 843%! Considering BTFD Coin’s growth trajectory, this could be a smart play for anyone who missed the boat on Neiro but still wants to get in on a meme coin that’s on the rise. Why BTFD Coin Is the Meme Coin You Need Right Now So, what makes BTFD Coin such a compelling second chance? Here’s a rundown of why it should be at the top of your list for potential meme coin investments: Proven Presale Success: With over $900,000 raised and 21 billion tokens sold, BTFD Coin is gaining serious traction in the market. The strong presale performance is an indication that there is plenty of interest in the project. A Strong Community: Over 2,000 Bulls are already holding BTFD Coins, and the community continues to grow. Community-driven projects tend to thrive in the meme coin space, and BTFD Coin’s strong following gives it a solid foundation for long-term success. Real Utility: BTFD Coin offers tangible utility in the form of high staking rewards and a Play-to-Earn game. This adds intrinsic value to the coin and makes it more than just a speculative asset. Massive Growth Potential: With the presale still in full swing, there’s plenty of room for early investors to lock in great prices before the coin hits exchanges. If the price rises as expected, the potential for high returns is huge. Take Action Now: Don’t Let This Chance Slip Away If you missed out on Neiro and are looking for a way to make up for lost time, BTFD Coin offers a golden opportunity. With its strong presale performance, community-driven focus, and exciting features like staking rewards and a P2E game, it’s a meme coin you won’t want to miss. The price is still a bargain, but it won’t stay there forever. Don’t let FOMO take over—now’s the time to secure your BTFD Coin while the presale is still live. With the potential for huge returns, this is a second chance that doesn’t come around often. Grab your BTFD Coins today and be part of the meme coin revolution!

A crypto analyst has underscored why this support level is crucial for Bitcoin’s next price rally, as it could set the stage for a potential retest above the $100,000 All-Time High (ATH). Bitcoin Price Retests $96,400 To Trigger Surge To $100,000 Prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital took to X (formerly Twitter) on December 4 to inform his over 518,000 followers about the current Bitcoin price action and future direction. The analyst suggested that if Bitcoin successfully tests the $96,440 support level, it could trigger a price increase to $100,068. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout Sharing a price chart, Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin has persistently retested its series of Lower Highs, establishing them as a key support level. In his Bitcoin price chart, “Lower Highs” means that each successive high point is lower than the previous point. This development is typically observed during a downtrend. However, with Bitcoin now treating these lower highs as support, it indicates a potential shift in the market, suggesting that prices may be stabilizing after declining. Rekt Capital also highlighted that Bitcoin is producing longer downside wicks, indicating that its price declined significantly during the time frame, but buyers stepped in. The analyst emphasized that Bitcoin is currently grabbing liquidity at lower prices without breaking below the key support trendline. A liquidity grab occurs when large volumes of orders at key price levels are triggered unexpectedly. In the case of Bitcoin, “grabbing liquidity” refers to the market dipping into levels where buy orders are clustered, enabling large players to execute trades. Rekt Capital has disclosed that, as long as this trend continues, Bitcoin will eventually move back up to reclaim the $96,440 level. Recovering this crucial support will allow Bitcoin to reach and even surpass the $100,000 milestone. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Bear Case Scenario Looking at the price chart presented by Rekt Capital, several support levels are highlighted, indicating price levels that Bitcoin could fall to if it fails to reclaim the $96,440 mark. While current Bitcoin price action indicates that it could potentially reach $100,000, the analyst has suggested that if the pioneer cryptocurrency fails to hold the $96,440 support, it might retest a lower support level of around $91,070. As indicated by the red line on the price chart, $91,070 is a critical price level for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency also falls below this level, it could crash to new lows around $87,325. As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $96,737, marking a 3.24% increase over the past week. A drop below the $87,300 level would represent more than a 10% crash from Bitcoin’s current value.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 301,800 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks the Ethereum-based decentralized oracle Chainlink ( LINK ) is poised to spark a five-wave surge to a new all-time high. Bluntz relies on the Elliott Wave theory, a technical analysis approach that states a bullish asset often witnesses a five-wave rally. Says Bluntz, “Major breakout on LINK today, all you have to do is take one look at LINK/BTC before you realize that you are probably not late and still early. It underperformed pretty much everything for the entirety of the bull run and now seems to be playing turbo catch-up. Probably one of the very few I would categorize as a dino coin that isn’t complete vaporware.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that LINK will explode to a new record high of $70. At time of writing, LINK is worth $24.44. Turning to Near ( NEAR ), the analyst says he’s bullish on the Ethereum rival after it breached a diagonal resistance on its Bitcoin pair (NEAR/ BTC ). “Revenge of the dinos. NEAR/BTC pair finally broke out.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $7.42. Bluntz also thinks that the Solana ( SOL )-based meme token dogwifhat ( WIF ) is primed to outperform the broader meme sector. “Huge six-month+ basing/inverse head and shoulder structure on US dollar pair. Double daily divergences against doge and double 12-hour bull divergences against PEPE. If you are playing memes, you want to outperform DOGE, that should always be the goal.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, WIF is worth $3.31.

The firm stated it is keen to launch under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) while upholding the regulations. Ripple posted through their X platform : Despite some speculation, $RLUSD isn’t launching today. We’re in lockstep with the NYDFS on final approval and will share updates as soon as possible. We are fully committed to launching under the supervision of NYDFS and upholding the highest regulatory standards. ~Ripple The launch of RLUSD stablecoin is set to redefine Ripple’s primary use case, moving it beyond its “memecoin” perception. The RLUSD will battle with market giants like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC as it will feature on XRPL and Ethereum. The stablecoin can kickstart DeFi activity on XRPL if it matches a fraction of USDT’s $134 billion in circulation. December 4 was marked for the big announcement Earlier, Ripple signaled that December 4 would be a tentative launch day, anticipating regulatory clearance by then. Although the launch is delayed, Ripple is set to sell its stablecoin, the RLUSD, to the public. Such a feat will see the firm grow into a big player in New York’s regulated digital finance market and stablecoin ecosystem. In June, Ripple officially unveiled its stablecoin, which it characterizes as a 1:1 USD-pegged asset fully backed by USD deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and other cash equivalents. Later in the year, the stablecoin went through beta testing on the Ethereum main net, XRP ledger, and Ripple’s decentralized blockchain. Ripple’s CEO says Paul Atkin will bring back common sense to the SEC While announcing the delayed launch, Ripple’s CEO also shared remarks about the SEC. Brad Garlinghouse supported the nomination of Paul Atkins for the SEC chairperson position. He believes that Atkins is an outstanding choice at the helm of SEC. Ripple CEO notes Atkins will bring back common sense to the agency. According to one industry source, Atkins recently voiced a desire to let GOP Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” lead on crypto policy alongside her fellow GOP Commissioner Mark Uyeda. Brad also stated that with the team, it’s time to swiftly and definitively end the prohibition era on crypto. He believes such changes will restore freedom of choice and spur economic growth and innovations in America.

37231256,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316526,1733359363,"Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXTools – JEETMAS, CHAINSAW","As Bitcoin (BTC) takes another look at the major $100,000 resistance zone, traders are anticipating that altcoin markets could continue heating up, and are thus flocking to micro-cap gem top crypto gainers today in the DEX markets. Bitcoin rose briefly above $99,000 on Wednesday while Ethereum (ETH) continued to close in on the $4,000 level. Other major altcoins were also on the front foot, creating great conditions for micro-cap coins to pump. Traders looking to bank a quick 10 or even 100x often flock to the highly risky DEX markets as they search for top crypto gainers today. It’s important to note – many of these newly launched micro-cap tokens are scams and pump-and-dump schemes. And even the tokens of well-intentioned projects often fall to zero. However, some new tokens that started out with market caps below $1 million ended up striking a chord in the market, and going on to achieve market caps in the $100s of millions. The prospect of finding that one 100x gem is a key reason why traders brave the risks of the highly volatile and unpredictable DEX markets. Such traders often employ tools like DEXTools as they hunt for trending tokens. Here are some of the top crypto gainers today that will likely be catching their attention. Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXTools – Which Are They? Nothing (VOID) A new Solana meme coin called Nothing (VOID) is one of the top crypto gainers today, having rallied 3,800% in the past 24 hours to a market cap of just over $12 million, per DEXTools . VOID has seen an impressive $12 million in trading volumes since its launch earlier in the day, and has amassed a respectable $700,000 in mostly locked liquidity. That said, its lack of engagement on social media platforms like X suggest it probably won’t retain value for long. Nothing may soon reach its real value, as implied by its name. That suggests it’s not a good candidate for the best crypto to buy now. Merry Jeetmas (JEETMAS) Another Solana meme coin amongst the top crypto gainers today is Merry Jeetmas (JEETMAS), which was last up 3,300% in the past 24 hours. Per DEXTools , its market cap remained tiny at just $156,000 with tiny liquidity of around $28,200. The Christmas-themed meme coin is doing a better job of generating hype on X than Nothing, posting entertaining new memes roughly every hour. The meme coin has also paid for ads and boosts, so may stand a solid chance of reaching million dollar status. Quick 10x gains are certainly a decent probability for JEETMAS, though, as with most new meme coins, this one will likely fade to zero soon. Doge Mascot (CHAINSAW) A new Depart of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) inspired Ethereum meme coin called Doge Mascot (CHAINSAW), which appears to be referencing the idea of the D.O.G.E. taking a chainsaw to the US government in its cost-cutting efforts, is another one of the top crypto gainers today. Per DEXTools , it was last up 6,500% in the past 24 hours, reaching a market cap of around $300,000 with $70,000 in liquidity. CHAINSAW could do well in the weeks ahead as the countdown to the arrival of President-elect Donald Trump in the White House begins. Once Trump arrives, the D.O.G.E will get to work. And D.O.G.E-related meme coins could do very well. Of course, that doesn’t mean CHAINSAW will perform well. There will be millions of other similar meme coins vying for attention and mind-share. Most will be abject failures. Perhaps a better way for investors to do well in the meme coin market would be to instead get involved in meme coin presales. By running a presale, a meme coin gives itself a chance to build community hype and fund marketing, product and community development initiatives. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is a great example of a new meme coin project that has had huge success in doing all of these things. The project has raised a whopping more than $70 million in funds from early investors, and is putting these funds to work to build a leading web3 ecosystem. Pepe Unchained is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution and its developers have been busily building out all manner of dApps, including a DEX, a meme coin launch platform called Pepe Pump Pad, a block explorer, a bridge and much more. Just 10 days out from the end of the presale, PEPU is currently valued at around $100 million. But this is meme coin that has a high chance of reaching billion-dollar status – it has the funds, the community, the hype, the strong use case/technology. Learn more about Pepe Unchained , and why analysts at cryptonews.com rank it as one of their top presale picks for 2024, in the below video.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/doge-christmas-dogechris-memecoin-will-explode-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The price has rallied 60 percent in the last seven days and according to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP is in a strong bullish trend on the larger time frames despite encountering resistance. The analyst also observed that XRP failed to follow through on a breakout past the $2.80 level, which acted as a short-term resistance. After a brief push higher, the price quickly rejected, breaking back down. Major Resistance Around $3 XRP has encountered significant resistance near the $3 level, a crucial psychological point and also a Fibonacci extension. XRP’s all-time high (ATH) is just slightly above $3, around $3.30. This makes the $3 mark an even more critical point for the price action since it’s very close to the ATH. Typically, when the price approaches an ATH, it tends to face resistance due to the historical significance of that price point. Short-Term Pullback XRP has faced a small pullback after reaching the $3 resistance. This is normal in bullish markets, and it doesn’t mean the market is turning bearish. Short-term pullbacks can happen even during larger upward trends. Given the rejection at $3 and the current price behavior, it’s possible we could see a deeper pullback in the short term. A pullback could test lower support levels, such as $2.50 or even $2.30, providing a better entry point for those looking to re-enter long positions.

Then, Layne Nadeau from NVAL answers questions about cryptocurrencies' role in energy markets and AI in Ask an Expert.  –S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Digital Asset Outlook for 2025  While 2024 may be remembered as the year bitcoin went mainstream, we believe the focus in 2025 will shift to real-world use cases for digital assets — often considered crypto’s Achilles' heel. To enable these use cases, stablecoins will likely emerge as the backbone for broader corporate adoption.  Stablecoins were initially designed to facilitate trading, lending, and borrowing in digital assets, primarily on digital asset trading platforms (centralized exchanges, or CEXs). However, we are now witnessing a shift from these original purposes toward “real-world” applications. This can be seen in the chart below in the growing prominence of the “other” category in the stablecoin ecosystem.  Challenges of current systems  Today, international fiat currency transfers rely on the correspondent banking system, which has mostly stayed the same since real-time gross settlement systems were adopted in the early 1990s. Membership charges, transaction costs, and volume-based discounts typically determine fees. Settlement processes are opaque, governed by price-time priority systems that lack transparency for end users.  Why stablecoins are transformative  As representations of money on the internet, stablecoins offer unmatched flexibility, speed, and availability — key factors driving their increasing adoption. Here are some of their real-world applications:  Cross-border payments: Stablecoins enable the transfer of USD assets across borders at speeds comparable to email, in stark contrast to the days-long delays of SWIFT transactions. This advantage is especially significant in emerging markets, where the Bank for International Settlements has reported a decline in correspondent banking relationships. Stablecoins offer a potential solution to this gap, addressing inefficiencies in cross-border financial systems.  Supply chain dynamics: Stablecoins could revolutionize supply chain efficiency, reducing costs and potentially curbing inflation. Optimizing working capital is a priority for treasury departments worldwide. For instance, Tether has already ventured into trade finance, demonstrating the tangible benefits stablecoins can bring to supply chain operations.  Remittance flows: Global remittance flows were estimated at $857 billion in 2023. Stablecoins facilitate faster and cheaper transfers, allowing recipients to access funds more quickly. They also enable remittance providers to hold smaller balances in local currencies, reducing FX risk and easing the burden on balance sheets. These innovations enhance efficiency and reduce costs across the remittance industry.  On-chain FX: As of June 2023, research from Cumberland revealed that 99.3% of stablecoins by market capitalization were linked to the USD. Over time, the emergence of non-USD stablecoins will likely create a 24/7, instant-settlement FX market, further enhancing the flexibility of global trade and finance.  Barriers to growth  Despite these advantages, stablecoins remain a relatively small part of the global financial landscape—equivalent to just 1% of U.S. M2 money supply and 1% of FX transactions. Regulatory changes, particularly in the U.S., are crucial for further growth. Although three significant bills were introduced during the Biden administration to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance by banks, little progress was made. With the anticipated Trump administration taking office in early 2025, regulatory clarity may improve, paving the way for broader adoption.  The outlook for 2025  In 2025, we anticipate increased adoption of digital assets as real-world use cases mature. Adoption will likely be particularly strong among primary commodity traders, producers, importers, and shipping companies. These businesses face challenges such as inefficient payment corridors between developed markets and underdeveloped ones in regions such as Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Stablecoins could provide much-needed solutions, enabling faster, more efficient transactions in these critical sectors.  Corporations will no longer view digital assets with skepticism. Instead, they will recognize the tangible benefits this infrastructure can bring to their operations—and ultimately to their bottom line. As adoption grows, digital assets will step out of the shadows, rendering the “crypto is a solution looking for a problem” argument obsolete.  - Mick Roche, global head of trading, Zodia Markets  Ask an Expert  Q. What does crypto have to do with energy markets?  Global energy markets are evolving to include global tracking of energy generation, consumption, and the carbon footprint of various activities. Carbon credit markets have a market capitalization of approximately $2 trillion and are expected to grow dramatically following the UN COP29 global climate conference announcement on global carbon offset markets.  Due to the global scale of energy and carbon offsetting, distributed ledgers are key to enabling efficient global participation. Blockchains are being used to tokenize and track tradeable energy and carbon offset assets, accelerating the growth of these markets.  Blockchain tools and infrastructure companies powering energy and carbon offset markets are seeing significant growth and are being followed closely by researchers and investors.  Q. Why does AI need crypto?  As AI grows, so does the focus on the energy required to power it. By 2027, it's estimated that AI could use more energy than the Netherlands, consuming at least 85.4 terawatt-hours of electricity annually.  The expanding need for energy increases the focus on renewable energy sources as the environmental impact of fossil fuel energy production raises ever more concerns. Blockchain technology is being used to efficiently track renewable energy production and use by AI; it also powers carbon credit markets to offset the carbon footprint of global AI infrastructure.  Distributed computing solutions that coordinate large numbers of computers are being developed to serve the global demand for AI computing power. The efficiency of blockchain technology enables solutions for the organization of and payment for these resources.  - Layne Nadeau, CEO, NVAL  Keep Reading  MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor urged Microsoft to invest in bitcoin ahead of its shareholder vote.

37230658,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51341,1733356845,"XRP Price Can Get to $97,000 Like the Bitcoin Price Says Analyst, Ripple Rival to Mirrors its Gains","An ambitious prediction about the XRP price by a crypto trader, BowTiedBull, has sparked excitement among investors. He claims that if the Bitcoin price climbed from $2 to $97,000, so could the XRP price. His outrageous prediction is shining a spotlight on XRP’s long-term potential, which is driven by increasing adoption and legal victories. However, as XRP gains traction, an undervalued altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) , with high-growth potential, is emerging as a worthy rival. With its cutting-edge features, AI integration, and practical utility, RCOF is poised to mirror and possibly even outdo XRP’s gains. $97,000 XRP Price Prediction: Can it reach Bitcoin Price levels? Analysts like BowTiedBull @BowTiedBull, are increasingly optimistic about XRP’s potential to reach ambitious XRP price levels, including hitting $97,000 like the Bitcoin price. This extraordinary projection isn’t baseless; it is fueled by several factors that showcase XRP’s growing adoption and relevance in the current market. XRP’s utility as a bridge currency for cross-border payments is gaining traction among banks and payment providers. This is driving demand for the token, pushing up the XRP price. Ripple’s partnerships with major financial institutions continue to strengthen XRP’s position as a cornerstone in global financial infrastructure and drive up the XRP price. These partnerships position XRP as a utility tool for financial institutions and underscore Ripple’s commitment to promoting financial inclusion. Ripple’s recent legal victory over the SEC has been pivotal in the 409% rise in the XRP price over the past month. This ruling alleviated some of XRP’s regulatory uncertainty, reigniting investor confidence and paving the way for institutional adoption. With more legal clarity, the XRP price could grow tremendously, mirroring the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin’s deflationary model, with its halving cycles, is a big contributor to the Bitcoin price growth. XRP’s capped supply and rising demand are creating scarcity. As demand grows, the XRP price could climb higher, making BowTiedBull’s $97,000 prediction more plausible. RCO Finance: The Ripple Rival Set to Mirror XRP Price Gains While the XRP price chases Bitcoin price-like levels, its ambitious target spotlights RCO Finance , a Ripple rival with immense potential to achieve massive returns at a fraction of the price.

37230656,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51291,1733356831,"Ethereum Developments Trigger $4,000 Price Rally While Whale Data Shows Accumulation For IntelMarkets and PEPE","The crypto market is witnessing significant shifts, with well-known performers like ETH and PEPE experiencing a correction. Ethereum’s price took a battering, while Pepe coin (PEPE) also lost ground. Both are recovering lost price points after a recent rally. Meanwhile, bullish signals for IntelMarkets INTL offer a jump to $0.07 as its Stage 7 concludes. IntelMarkets (INTL) is also making waves with an impressive presale, hinting at a possible surge. Analysts predict that IntelMarkets INTL, a novel AI crypto, will also ride this bullish wave. Its innovative blend of AI and DeFi, which aims to reshape the crypto trading scene, has caught investors’ attention. Tipped to outperform PEPE, the top-performing meme coin, this is a new DeFi project to watch out for. Ethereum (ETH) Price Ready to Close 2024 Over $4,000 ETH is a top altcoin, and the price of Ethereum managed to withstand the bearish markets of last week and sustain its upward momentum. The Ethereum price climbed by 4% in the past seven days but is still trading at above $3,500. With a 32% rise on the monthly chart, it cements its status as one of the top crypto coins. During the year, Ethereum prices touched a high of $4,000. While there has been a major dip since then, the current market sentiments seem likely to push it above this level in the coming days. Seven-day technical indicators like the Hull Moving Average and Momentum are at sell, while the 14-day RSI is at neutral for the short term. Community sentiment is still bullish today but is moving towards bearish at 59%. Source: CoinMarketCap Pepecoin (PEPE) Retraces After Massive Price Rally After its remarkable surge in November, PEPE started dipping, losing over 10% in price over the past week. It has recovered and experienced a rise of 2.8% over the weekend. The coin is still highly volatile, while community sentiment remains bullish. Source: CoinMarketCap Technical indicators like the RSI are mainly neutral for day trading, while 30-day technical indicators are divided between neutral and buy for the coin. People are moving into positions with PEPE, and many are opting to accumulate IntelMarkets (INTL) for its upcoming price pump. Whales’ Find a New Winner: IntelMarkets (INTL) IntelMarkets (INTL) is a new AI crypto that is stirring up a lot of attention. Its current presale is in the news, having raised over $2.7 million. Its major growth potential and cross-AI-DeFi product utility are its core appeals, generating sustained demand. In stage seven of the ICO, a token sells for just $0.064. This low entry makes picking up the INTL token easy, while its projected gains bring whales to the presales. Providing a low entry, the projected 50x gain after its debut makes it a whale favorite—retailers are also doubling down. As it approaches its ICO, investors are betting big and overlooking top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and PEPE. Besides its significant upside potential, INTL’s future transformation of the crypto trading scene with AI puts it in the spotlight. Offering a merger of all the advantages of AI technology, blockchain, and DeFi, it will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels. Its first commercial application of AI technology with a proprietary Layer-1 blockchain offers access to crypto trading assets. IntelMarkets has a range of advanced processing tools to improve trading performance.
