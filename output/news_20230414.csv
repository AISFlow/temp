Ether ( ETH-USD ) is set to end the week ~13% higher after the successful Shanghai software upgrade. Markets are largely expecting the Federal Reserve to pause its rate-hiking campaign in June, after one more 25-basis point increase in May, as wholesale inflation unexpectedly slid and retail inflation showed signs of moderating. Meanwhile, ether ( ETH-USD ) climbed to the highest level seen since last August. The software update, completed Wednesday evening, enables users to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time ever. Shanghai, or Shapella, marks the end of the network's multi-year transition to a Proof-of-Stake protocol from Proof-of-Work - the same one used by bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). ""Bitcoin and Ethereum are breaking out here,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst, OANDA. ​""Bitcoin has recaptured $30K, a pivotal level that was an entry level for many institutional investors in 2021. ETH is above $2.1K after a successful Shanghai upgrade and Ethereum is now fully Proof-of-Stake."" Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), which rose to a 10-month high of $31K on Friday, traded in the $27.8K-$30.5K range during the week. The total crypto market cap is now $1.28T, up 1.5% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz attributed the current rally to long-standing enthusiasts moving back into the market after last year's selloff. ""This rally has been built on the backs of the crypto community,"" he said. ""It's not new money... It really was retail driven."" In regulatory news, the SEC reopened a proposal from last year that would now require the registration of all crypto exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. ""Make no mistake: many crypto trading platforms already come under the current definition of an exchange and thus have an existing duty to comply with the securities laws,"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Notable News FTT Token ( FTT-USD ) more than doubled in value after attorneys representing bankrupt FTX reportedly told a court that the exchange is considering relaunching in Q2. The European arm of FTX received approval from a Swiss court to explore a potential sale.

Bitcoin Price Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) inched 0.4% higher to $30.47K at 7.01 pm ET and ether ( ETH-USD ) rose 4.8% to $2.11K. The Digital Trend, leader of Investing Group 'Technically Crypto' , believes the next few weeks could be a good time to take some profits in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). ""A rate pause is bullish for assets, and it's these expectations that are fueling the current rally,"" they noted. But with a recession looming, likely once the Fed starts cutting rates, BTC appears to be entering the ""danger zone"".

11763440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526926,1681513212,Top 3 Altcoins To Pay Attention To Over The Weekend,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to heat up and show a bullish trend in recent weeks, keeping an eye on promising altcoins that could potentially make significant gains shortly is always a good idea. However, the crypto market is currently saturated with several altcoins, so keeping tabs on every crypto in the market can be difficult. In this article, we’ve compiled a list of top altcoins to pay attention to over the weekend. Related Reading: ADA Rallies Higher Gains Following Cardano’s Aiken Launch Top 3 Altcoins To Watch Over The Weekend The top on the list is Cardano (ADA). Cardano is a blockchain platform that aims to offer faster, more secure transactions than traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With a market cap of over $15 billion, Cardano is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and has been making steady gains in recent weeks. In addition to its strong fundamentals, ADA’s chart has been showing some bullish momentum, and according to the 1-day time frame, the asset still has a long way to go in the rally. On the chart, though the asset just tapped a major high, it still has external liquidity above the $0.5 region that needs to be taken. The asset’s trading volume has also risen in the past 7 days, indicating an ongoing violet buying pressure. ADA’s daily trading volume has surged from $218 million as of last week Friday to $739 million over the past 24 hours. Binance Coin (BNB) is the second on the list. BNB is a native token of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange and has been one of the top performers in the market over the past 30 days. With a market cap of nearly $52 billion, Binance Coin is currently the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap and has seen significant gains thanks to the success of the Binance exchange. In addition to its strong performance, Binance Coin (BNB) seems closer to hitting an external high at $399. Though it’s not certain when the asset will hit this mark, with the crypto trading volume recording a surge in the past week, the tapping of the external high might be closer and could be worth watching out for over the weekend. Polygon (MATIC) appears third on the list. Polygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to provide faster, cheaper transactions for users. With a market cap of over $10 billion, Polygon is currently the seventeenth largest cryptocurrency by market cap. and has been making significant gains in recent months. In addition to its strong fundamentals, Polygon also benefits from the increased demand for Layer 2 solutions as the Ethereum network continues to face scalability issues. MATIC hasn’t made any significant gains compared to other top altcoins in the crypto market. However, the asset price chart shows its time to outshine the others may just be closer. On the 1-day time frame, MATIC has formed a double bottom indicating an upcoming surge. MATIC also seems to form a W pattern on the chart alongside the double bottom. These two setups have made MATIC an altcoin to watch over the weekend. Though, it’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market can be extremely volatile, and there are no guarantees when investing in altcoins. However, one could identify profit opportunities by examining projects like Cardano, Binance Coin, and Polygon. Moreover, while being an experienced investor or not, it’s worth noting to keep these altcoins on the radar over the weekend and beyond.

Between Binance’s BTC-TUSD and BTC-USDT trading pairs, TUSD’s market share rose to 49%, almost equalling tether's.  “This is a massive increase over just a few weeks,” Clara Medalie, head of research at Kaiko, said.  However, TUSD’s growth could not offset the rapid decline in the BTC-USDT pair’s trading volume after Binance waived its zero fee discount for tether, according to Kaiko data. Moreover, larger buy and sell orders are still placed for the USDT pair, per Kaiko.“This suggests that traders are still reluctant to use TUSD despite zero fees,” Medalie added.  TUSD’s rise has come as Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, picked the token as heir of its preferred Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust.  The exchange restored trading with TUSD after a six-month pause after Paxos’ decision to stop issuing BUSD and assigned its zero-fee trading discount to the BTC-TUSD pair and waived the promotion from BUSD and USDT starting on March 22.  The $132 billion stablecoin market is undergoing a major upheaval stemming from a regulatory crackdown and a banking crisis in the U.S. In February, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYFDS), the state’s top financial regulator, forced Paxos to cease minting BUSD, the third-largest stablecoin, with a $16 billion market cap. Last month, the collapse of crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank, reserve partner of the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, sent shockwaves through the market. In the aftermath, USDC suffered more than $10 billion in outflows.  Tether’s USDT and TUSD have emerged as clear winners of the crisis. TUSD has become the crypto market’s fifth-largest stablecoin, with a $2 billion market cap. USDT’s circulating supply has grown $10 billion in the past months and is closing in on its all-time high.  Stablecoins are a crucial element in the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading on exchanges and serving as a bridge between government-issued fiat money and digital assets.  TUSD is a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by crypto firm ArchBlock, previously known as TrustToken. Its value is fully backed by fiat assets, according to blockchain data provider ChainLink’s proof-of-reserve monitoring tool. In 2020, little-known Asian conglomerate Techteryx acquired TUSD’s intellectual property rights, TrustToken said at the time.",NEUTRAL,USDT | TUSD,EXCHANGE | TRADING | USDT | BNB | TUSD,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/14/trueusds-bitcoin-trading-volume-nears-tethers-on-binance-but-traders-hesitate-to-use-the-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84e8eba0a0a385f7709b5966d4d3f1a751f9242e-1306x706.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This price surge marks the end of a prolonged period of crypto winter and the beginning of a new uptrend for the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is currently trading at $30,200, experiencing a slight decrease of 0.8% in the last 24 hours, despite recently reaching its new yearly high of $30,900 due to a strong bullish momentum. With the bear market seemingly behind, there is a growing expectation among investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts that BTC will continue to climb and possibly reach new all-time highs. However, uncertainty remains as to whether Bitcoin is currently in a new phase of accumulation to reach higher levels or if its support floors can withstand a potential pullback. Related Reading: Ethereum Soars To 11-Month High Amid Massive Staking Withdrawals Anticipating The Next Move For Bitcoin According to a trader known as “Alan,” Bitcoin is undergoing a significant shift, which describes the current trading levels as “platform I” and “platform II.” At present, Bitcoin is transitioning from the first platform, which is between $30,000 and $40,000, to the second platform, which spans between $60,000 and $70,000. The MACD indicator, also known as the D3 chart, is a widely used technical analysis tool for identifying long-term trends in the market. This type of chart relies on a longer time frame to analyze market trends, which for trader Alan, based on the MACD bullish cross on the D3 chart, this bullish signal has triggered a new bull run for Bitcoin, indicating that the cryptocurrency may be on the path to new higher highs. Moreover, Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, a blockchain technology company, has recently noted that Bitcoin’s price has significantly increased in the first quarter of 2023. From 31st December 2022 to 31st March 2023, the price of Bitcoin increased by approximately 70%, rising from $16.6k to $28k. For Back, If this growth rate were to continue, Bitcoin’s price could reach $48k by June, $82k by September, and a staggering $140k by December. However, if the goal is to reach a price of $100k by the end of the year, the growth rate would need to fall from 70% to 53% for the second, third, and fourth quarters of the year. This would represent a more moderate rate of growth but one that is still significant for Bitcoin. Risks Loom In The Near Term For BTC According to Colin Wu, the expiration of 30,500 BTC options with a Put Call Ratio of 0.99, a max pain point of $29,000, and a notional value of $0.93 billion is about to expire. A ratio of 0.99 suggests that there are slightly more put options than call options, which could indicate that investors are bearish on Bitcoin’s short-term prospects. The max pain point of $29,000 could exert downward pressure on BTC’s price as the options expire. This is because option holders may try to push the price toward this level to limit their losses. If Bitcoin’s price experiences a decline, there is a near-term support level at $29,500 for the cryptocurrency. However, if this support level fails to hold, there is a potential for Bitcoin to drop further toward the $28,300 support level.

42412303,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3yL6,1681507179,"Bitcoin Is the 'Boring, Old Grandpa' Right Now Compared to Ether: Dexterity Capital Manager Partner","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is steadfast and mundane, said Michael Safai, managing partner at financial services firm Dexterity Capital. But that's a good thing.  “Bitcoin’s going to be the boring old grandpa right now in the room,” Safai told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday referring to why, during these uncertain economic times, bitcoin’s rally may be due to its simple, more familiar story.  Certainly a lot of the excitement in the crypto market is happening in ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, he noted.  On Wednesday Ethereum underwent its Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella. The blockchain’s upgrade raised questions about whether there would be major sell-offs. Instead, ETH's price inched above $2,000 two days after the long anticipated upgrade, beating out bitcoin in options trading, for the first time this year.  While the upgrade allows users to withdraw the ETH they’ve staked (as well as reducing fees and opening space on the blockchain for more transactions), Safai pointed out that “a lot of things are happening” with ether, including allegations from U.S. government officials who say it is a security and should be regulated as such.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is sidestepping the “chaos of all the investigations,” he said. For now, at least, it appears the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is comfortable with treating bitcoin as a commodity, unlike its view of ether.  With Ethereum’s upgrade, the “rules of the game have just changed,” Safai said. It may also be the reason there is excitement in the markets from users.  “We’re seeing more activity on the options side and I expect that to continue,” he said.

42387697,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQnvpn,1681507128,"Bitcoin Holds Steady Near $30.5K, Ether Circles Around $2.1K","Bitcoin and ether’s prices rose handsomely in an eventful week of mildly encouraging inflation data and Ethereum’s long-awaited Shapella upgrade.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at $30,450, up 0.4% from 24 hours ago and more than 9% for the week, according to CoinDesk data. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization breached $31,000 earlier in the day before retreating during the U.S. intraday (ET).  Ether (ETH) gained 5.4% on Friday to recently trade at $2,105. It’s up over 12% for the week.  “Ether and bitcoin have both seen upside follow-through after confirming base breakouts in late March, which are as positive intermediate-term developments on their charts,” Will Tamplin, senior analyst at technical research firm Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk in an email.  Tamplin noted that ETH and BTC's next major resistance levels are roughly $2,400 and $35,900, respectively, targeted over the next several weeks.  Yet, he added that with both assets ""beginning to look extended in the short term ... we would not rule out a pullback in the coming days to digest recent gains,” with initial support near $1,670 for ETH and $25,200 for BTC.  Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto analytics firm Amberdata, highlighted in an interview with CoinDesk that the relative expensiveness of ETH calls versus puts in ETH – also known as the risk reversal skew – currently sits positive to the call side for all expirations post-Shapella. Magadini said that this trend signals “bullish activity in the sense that people are willing to pay more on the call side.”  Typically, a call buyer is bullish about the market, while the put buyer is bearish.  Magadini noted that while bitcoin has driven options volume, open interest and volatility this year, particularly as BTC surged in January and after last month’s banking crisis, “the Shapella upgrade is the first time that we're getting some life back into the Ethereum market,” he said.  Prior to the upgrade, investors split on how the market would react to the event, with some expecting potential selling pressure to ETH and others believing no major impact on the market.  “On Ethereum, developers have proven that they can follow through on their vision,” Magadini said. “We've made a major milestone and so this brings back validity and credibility to Ethereum.”  Meanwhile, several other altcoins jumped Friday. Decentralized smart contracts platform Injective Protocol’s INJ surged more than 28% in the past 24 hours to trade at $8.64, while artificial intelligence-focused crypto protocol Fetch.ai's FET rose by 13% to trade at 40 cents. Layer 2 network Optimism's OP was up 7% to $2.62.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures the overall crypto market performance, was up 9% for the week.  Equities wrapped up Friday lower as investors started to process results from the current quarterly earnings season: The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 0.4% for the day.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | INJ,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | INJ,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/14/bitcoin-holds-steady-near-305k-ether-circles-around-21k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a23d3a7754add9ebe4d6ab9d9ca49150ed0e3229-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410987,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvIJv,1681505921,"Bitcoin, Ether Turn Upward in a Busy Week of Ethereum and Inflation News","Major digital assets surged in an eventful week that included encouraging inflation data and the much anticipated Ethereum Shanghai upgrade. Once-shaken confidence in crypto markets rose, along with valuations and trading volumes.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have risen about 9% and 11%, respectively, over the past seven days, with much of the gains occurring over the latter few days.  In recent economic reports inflation was lower than expected and jobless claims were higher than expected. The Fed may have been hoping for such signs as reason to justify not raising interest rates again when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) next meets in May.  Bond markets have begun to respond. The spread between two- and 10-year Treasury bonds, while still negative, has narrowed since early March.  Crypto markets’ biggest news was the completion of the Shanghai update, allowing ETH stakers to withdraw their ETH deposits. Ether has responded positively, increasing about 9% in price since the upgrade was completed.  One of investors’ prevailing fears was that the potential unlocking of 18.2 million ETH would lead to selling pressure on the asset. However, markets have so far viewed the de- risking of ETH staking positively.  ETH’s price upswing has led to the asset chipping away at bitcoin dominance by market capitalization. Crypto market trading volume also rose, as ETH’s daily volume spiked to more than twice its 20-day moving average on Thursday. BTC volume breached its 20-day moving average each day this week, with the exception of Thursday  Both BTC and ETH breached the upper range of their Bollinger Bands this week, an indication of increased bullishness. The Bollinger Bands indicator is a technical tool that plots an asset's moving average and two standard deviations above and below. A breach of Bollinger Bands in either direction is considered to be a significant event, in this case a bullish one.  Some altcoins had a push higher this week as well. ARB, the native token for Ethereum layer 2 system Arbitrum, led the way – up 28% over the past seven days.

That’s a change from the 79%-21% breakdown comprising Olympus’ $200 million treasury of stablecoins, volatile assets and protocol-owned liquidity.  The tweaking will give Olympus more exposure to ether, which at $8.4 million Friday was already the largest “volatile asset” in the reserve treasury backing OHM. Ether rallied hard this week after the much-anticipated Shapella upgrade failed to trigger the mass sell-off many traders had feared would come from a flood of newly unlocked ETH.  This shift is unlikely to be as “aggressive” on ETH that the framework’s authors said many community members called for. It will, however, result in a decrease in Olympus’ exposure to so-called stablecoins such as DAI that faltered during the March banking crisis.  Read more: Olympus DAO Might Be the Future of Money (or It Might Be a Ponzi)  “Treasury team recognizes the need for Olympus to decrease reliance on stablecoins with centralized backing,” the proposal read. “Increasing ETH exposure marginally is one step in that direction while not undermining the relative stability of OHM’s backing in the near term.”  Relwyn said the treasury operations team “agrees” with community members’ bullishness, but cautioned the protocol can’t just YOLO everything into ETH without incurring a hearty dose of risk. Number may go up right now, but “number can go down, too,” said Relwyn,  Another reason for the measured approach is operational, Relwyn said, noting Olympus’ mechanisms for rebalancing OHM’s backing could get wonky if the treasury’s ether holdings grow too large. Those mechanics currently price OHM in DAI, by far the treasury’s largest crypto holding at nearly $80 million.  “If it priced itself in ETH, it could have more heavy ETH backing,” Relwyn said. “Mixing the two can be dangerous” for how Olympus manages its so-called range-bound stability.  The vote passed with nearly unanimous approval midday Friday. Seventy-six wallets that together held 23,000 OHM tokens participated in the vote.",NEUTRAL,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | DAI,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/14/olympus-dao-votes-to-buy-more-eth-for-treasury-backing-ohm-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/967bece82549b6c73cdc4daf1473d3e31a7cc647-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

ETH can now be withdrawn from stake as of Wednesday evening. The early action has been mixed. With the initial reaction being net positive staking flow. As of Friday afternoon, the net flow is negative. ETH has rallied 8% since Wednesday and could be signaling that the rest of the crypto market is about to catch up to Bitcoin's recent gains. When I last covered Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) for Seeking Alpha in early January , it was a preview of what to expect for the ""Shanghai Upgrade"" to the network. This upgrade is an important one because it allows for ETH withdrawals from stake. To quickly recap why this is necessary Ethereum launched as a proof of work blockchain. The core developers of Ethereum have long wanted to transition the network to a proof of stake blockchain in part because it's a far more energy efficient consensus mechanism. Rather than the miner validation that is required for proof of work, proof of stake validation is done by those who deposit the network's native currency in the system. I've actually written more deeply about staking as a concept for Seeking Alpha and you can read that here : When a user stakes their crypto assets, they're essentially pledging those coins to the blockchain to help secure the network. In return for pledging their coins for network security, the user receives a staking reward that is generated from the fees that validators earn from confirming transactions. To transition from proof of work to proof of stake, Ethereum had to have a robust network of staking validators before making the change. Otherwise, the network could have ground to a halt. What the Ethereum developers did was launch a second Ethereum chain called ""Beacon"" that worked alongside Ethereum's proof of work Mainnet network. Stakers could put ETH into stake on Beacon as early as 2020 - they just couldn't get it out. It wasn't until last year when Beacon was ""merged"" with the PoW Mainnet and Ethereum officially became a proof of stake blockchain. Despite the success of ""The Merge,"" staking withdrawals still weren't enabled yet. That changed this week with the successful implementation of the Shanghai upgrade. The Shanghai Effect There has been a theory in some crypto circles that Shanghai would be a ""sell the news"" event just as The Merge was back in September. The rationale behind that theory was that staking withdrawals would create a large outflow of ETH from stake. And that newly unlocked ETH would end up getting sold. When I first covered Shanghai in January, I saw the opposite scenario as more likely: Enabling ETH withdrawal from stake following Shanghai does raise a key question; could un-staking put sell pressure on Ethereum as funds come out of lock? Possibly. But I think there might be a greater chance that the ability to un-stake could actually bring more ETH into stake rather than out of stake. I take this view because I think there are potential staking participants on the sidelines who have been waiting to see how the merge and subsequent network upgrades go before locking funds without an ability to withdraw. We're only two days since Shanghai was completed and early indications were that the de-risked theory was holding up as the staking flow on ETH was positive on Thursday. As of Friday, the net ETH staking flow has turned slightly negative with net flow currently around -137K ETH: Token Unlocks Since Shanghai, there has also been a slight decline in total validators. That figure has declined by about 0.3% over the last week: ETH Validators (StakingRewards) Because Ethereum's minimum staking figure is 32 ETH, smaller holders have generally have to go through staking protocols like Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ) and we're not seeing a reduction in the usage there so far: Lido Finance (DeFi Llama) Another way users can stake on ETH indirectly is through staking pools. We have seen growth there also as staking pool services have gone from 12.3% share of stake during the merge to 13.3% share of stake today. Risks To Consider Going Forward We know that Kraken is shutting down its staking as a service business after conflict with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. Since Kraken accounts for nearly 7% of the ETH in stake, I'd say it's a near certainty that the 1.25 million ETH staked through Kraken is going to see a move elsewhere. Where that ETH goes is the question. It could get sold. Or it could get moved back into stake through a different provider. Coinbase ( COIN ) could theoretically be a winner there because that company looks poised to fight the SEC on just about any front and might appeal to Kraken users for staking simplicity's sake. It's far easier from the user's perspective to stake through a centralized exchange than it is to stake directly on the network. But there are also other on-chain ETH staking tools that appear to have platform tokens that I would personally be very cautious about buying. I went into detail on one such coin with BlockChain Reaction subscribers Friday morning. Summary It's still very early to truly assess what the successful Shanghai upgrade means for Ethereum longer term. I'm not surprised staking net flow was positive at one point yesterday. I'm a bit more surprised that ETH has rallied 8% from Wednesday's close of $1,917. But a ""buy the news"" event in ETH does make some sense with the benefit of hindsight. Ethereum is a network. And that network requires a fee structure to pay for transactions. Those fees are paid with ETH. The more ETH that is locked up in stake, the better for ETH's price provided there is demand for transaction validation on the Ethereum network. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been eating most of the coins in the crypto market for the last several weeks. Don't be surprised if ETH is now going to take a turn leading the market higher.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4594147-ethereum-sell-the-rumor-buy-the-shanghai?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11755788.jpeg

Crypto Exchanges, Banks, and Dealers have collapsed; this might be the perfect time to buy. HIVE has managed its balance sheet well, escaped the contagion risk relatively unscathed, and lives to fight on. Momentum is changing. Bitcoin is up in value this year. Strategic investors might be able to buy at the bottom. Momentum may have changed for the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners and perhaps the Blockchain industry. I track 15 disruptive technologies and break them down into 42 different industry sectors. I pivot my investments in and out of sectors as they gain and lose momentum. The change in momentum is often purely market-based; sometimes, it reflects a change in business fundamentals. I last traded the Blockchain sector in 2021; however, one of its subsectors has come back into focus. At the end of 2022, the Bitcoin Miners Sector started flashing buy on my dashboard and has made significant gains since then. 7 of the 17 miners I track are up more than 100% in 2023. Bitcoin Mining Segment (Author Database) 2022 A Painful Crypto Winter It all began with the Terra Luna (LUNA) collapse, and contagion quickly spread throughout the industry. Some of the largest names were brought down, and many others were mortally wounded. BlockFi (private company) is a crypto lender with a sizable mining operation and has filed for bankruptcy; it blamed the FTX (FTT-USD) collapse for its problems . For more on FTX and its problems, see this series of articles . BlockFi has an unpaid $275 million debt due from FTX and a further $1 billion in uncollateralized debt to other industry borrowers. $54 million is due from the bankrupt Core Scientific (CORZQ). Core was mining 47 Bitcoins a day, but rising energy costs made this an unprofitable business, and a whole stack of cards came falling down. Core continues to expand its mining operation post-bankruptcy . The contagion just kept spreading. Core Scientific filed for chapter 11 in December and followed Celsius Network LLC, which had plans for an IPO but is now working out a restructuring plan . Mawson (MIGI) signed a $20 million debt agreement with Celsius, paying nearly 4 million warrants. Celsius had invested a total of $300 million in Bitcoin mining operations. Two of the miners on my list that I had invested in before and looked at as candidates this time have, in my opinion, not had the best of times, and I worry about their ability to continue going forward. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) disclosed $80 million of exposure to the now-bust Compute North. Shareholders suffered a 60% dilution in 2022. Total debt was zero in 2021 but is now more than 200% of equity. MARA debt v equity over time (Author Database) Argo Blockchain Plc (ARBKF) accidentally posted bankruptcy papers on its website . Argo got a bailout to avoid bankruptcy from Galaxy Digital Holdings (BRPHF); it looks very temporary to me. Argo has rising debt, falling equity value, and falling cash reserves; it must take action to reverse this situation. With negative income, its debt repayments are not well covered. Argo debt v equity over time (Author Database) Choosing Whom to Buy Crypto Mining companies are showing significant gains, but the contagion risk and the exposure to the industry and Bitcoin make them very high risk. Strategic investing is about deciding whom to buy. More importantly, it is deciding who not to buy and when to stay on the sidelines. The contagion in the crypto market makes the strategic decision even more critical. Is now the time to buy a crypto miner, and if so, which one? Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin mining should be a relatively simple operation. Bitcoin miners buy mining computers, put them in buildings, power them with electricity, and mine Bitcoins (that means maintaining the ledger of Bitcoin activity). Bitcoin miners receive payment for maintaining the ledger in Bitcoins (that's a real oversimplification, but we need to distill the industry down to a business we can understand and compare, so bear with me). The volatility of the price of Bitcoin and the steep gains it was making in 2021 convinced many miners to hold onto their mined Bitcoins. They put them on their balance sheet as an asset and used the high asset value to borrow money/ raise capital to pay for their costs. This was all fine until the price of a Bitcoin collapsed, and the electricity cost grew beyond the coin's value. The highly leveraged miners have run into difficulty, those who did not carefully source their energy have become unprofitable, and those that used their Bitcoins as collateral or placed them with exchanges have run into contagion risk. A miner's profit should be the price they get for selling the Bitcoin minus the price it costs to produce them. The market sets the Bitcoin price and is very volatile. The cost of production is a function of the company's hash rate and the network hash rate (that gives the mining difficulty), which decides how much computing power is needed. The cost per kWh of electricity will provide the cost of that energy. Profits then have two key drivers the price of Bitcoins and the electricity cost needed to produce each coin. Mining Profits Have Returned Ark Invest publishes ""The Bitcoin Monthly,"" which tracks vital metrics affecting the Bitcoin industry. In January, it became clear that the mining profitability dynamics had changed significantly. Bitcoin Fundamentals (ARK Invest) For much of 2022, the price of a Bitcoin was less than its realized cost. In 2015 and 2019, we had similar periods of unprofitability. This sudden uptick is a fundamental change that could, if maintained, drive Mining profits for the next few years and will likely account for the shift in momentum identified at the beginning of this piece. ARK has remained a firm believer in BTC. Their Big Ideas 2023 publication renewed the 2030 bull case price target of $1.5 million per Bitcoin with a base case of $680K. (P65) Energy costs are forecast to continue to fall throughout 2023. If Bitcoin can hold the low it found late last year, the miners will have a profitable year, and investors will receive a good return. The fundamental of Price v Cost looks promising in the near to medium term. Which Miner Should We Buy? From a technical viewpoint, the three standout candidates are Cipher Mining Inc (CIFR), HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd (HIVE), and Hut 8 Mining Corp. (HUT). Bitcoin Miners 12 Month share price (Author Database) The sector remains depressed, but these three appear to have found a bottom with Bitcoin and broken higher. (sector performance is a simple average of share price; it is not weighted and includes only the shares I track, in this case, those on the first graphic of this article) I will write about Hut 8 and Cipher in the coming weeks, but this article will focus on HIVE. HIVE: The Basics HIVE was the first miner to go public in 2017; they have pursued a policy of owning their data centers and placed them to meet their chosen strategy (placed is used loosely; they bought existing facilities in place). HIVE sites are in colder environments (which reduces the need for air-conditioning to cool the mining machines) and close to green energy sites. Being close to green energy means they can act as a network balancing device. When the wind blows/the sun shines/the water falls, they use excess energy and have to reduce activity when it does not. HIVE has operations in Canada, Iceland, and Sweden. The Canada site is in Quebec, where HIVE owns a 30MW site powered entirely by green energy. In Sweden, their 17MW site is hydroelectricity powered, and the 4 MW site in Iceland is geothermally powered. These three sites lead to a total production cost of $13,634 (earnings call) per Bitcoin against a current price of $25,000. (total production includes energy, maintenance and rent fees). This cost structure gives HIVE a positive gross profit at every Bitcoin price throughout the recent downturn. HIVE Electricity Electricity is the key, in most cases, the only significant cost of a Bitcoin miner. How they deal with it determines their success or failure as a business. Theoretically, they should turn the machines off when electricity costs are high or have some deal to average them. The three miners I am considering are attempting to use their assets to generate additional revenue streams. These different streams may improve their sites' productivity and reduce the perceived income volatility of Bitcoin mining. The way they are attempting this will likely be a key differentiator. HIVE has managed to keep its cost of electricity extremely low; they do it by stopping operations when electricity becomes expensive. This means a drop in production, but what is the point of producing anything if you lose money doing it? ""Now you might notice, okay, we produced 44% less coins, but we did that very strategically. And the reason why is because when any of our indexed power costs went up, we would curtail that production strategically to avoid incurring any unprofitable production"" ( HIVE: 2023 Earnings call 3 2023 Transcript, 2023-2-28 ) A little later in the same call, HIVE explained that last quarter they dropped energy consumption from a maximum of 220 million kilowatt-hours to an average of only 100 million. They ran at less than half capacity for the quarter and reported a cost of electricity of $0.034 per kilowatt-hour. The average price of electricity in the US in January was $0.15 per kilowatt hour . HIVE is doing a great job of minimizing its cost of electricity. HIVE is developing a market for the heat produced by its miners. Of the three operational sites, two have a policy in place for selling the heat. They are in cold regions, so heat is a valuable commodity. In the Lachute site, Quebec, Canada, they use heat to an adjacent building. From the same earnings call. ""So people thought we were just piping cold -- warm air from the Bitcoin miners. No, we actually have a glycol heat exchange. It's a very advanced system. And so what we're doing is we're heating our industrial neighbor. That's a 200,000-square-foot swimming pool manufacturer. And you can see on the right here, that's actually the heat exchanger. And so what it's doing is that's getting the warm air for the Bitcoin miners, that's been heat warming the heat exchange fluid, and that fluid gets pumped into our neighbor's building. And you could see the entire very sophisticated heat exchange hardware here, that's how we actually heat."" In Sweden, HIVE plans to use the heat generated at its site to power a controlled environment agriculture site. This is another area of disruption that I follow. The dashboard is flashing sell for this sector; however, I remain committed. Climate change, political instability, and supply chain issues are causing food supply problems in many countries. Supermarkets in the UK have been forced to ration a range of food products in recent months for the first time since the second world war. HIVE plans to build a large greenhouse adjacent to their mining site, use the heat generated to grow salad greens and vegetables, and then sell them to local communities. HIVE is building a 9,000-square-foot Greenhouse at the Boden site in Sweden ( Slide 19 investor presentation ) ""So, this is our partnership with Agtira to do the greenhouse in Sweden. So, we've got some early indication that we believe this 4,000 square meter greenhouse can do about 800 tons of cucumbers or 320 tons of tomatoes per year. And we're looking to become the cucumber kings in Sweden"" ( HIVE: 2022 Earnings call 2 2023 Transcript, 2022-11-15 ) Agtira is traded on the Swedish exchange and is a controlled agriculture leader in the area, its sites include greenhouses as well as aquaponics, and indoor/vertical farms. This should add revenue to the HIVE mining operation. We will have to wait to see if it adds to profit. ""The co-creation of this project aids in food sustainability efforts. Boden is in discussion of the greenhouse at Boden. We hope to be completing this transaction shortly. This company is already building now. We've been doing our due diligence in other buildings."" ( HIVE: 2023 Earnings call 3 2023 Transcript, 2023-2-28 ) HIVE Financials Using the same graph as I did for Marathon and Argo shows how well HIVE has managed its balance sheet in comparison. Equity is down, but debt is relatively flat and just above Cash. In my view, it is in a much stronger position and more investable. Hive debt v equity over time (Author Database) There is currently no approved and accepted accounting principle for recording the value of digital currency from a mining operation. Contagion has been a massive problem in the crypto industry, and we have to look into each set of accounts to establish the possibility of a problem. With most companies, assets held at a bank are easily valued and can be drawn at any time; however, if those assets are crypto coins held on a crypto exchange, they are not the same. As a result, it is necessary to look into each company's accounts rather than rely on the standardized financials supplied by most websites. The following comes from the HIVE accounts for the nine months ending Dec 31st, 2022 HIVE values the coin on the date mined (note 3) and then puts the coin on the balance sheet as an intangible asset. The coins are revalued every time accounts are produced. The difference is placed in the profit and loss account, this is a fair way to deal with these assets, but it significantly impacts the perceived profit and loss account. Revaluing coins caused a paper loss of $79 million for the 9 months ending Dec 31st, 2021, and a profit of $95 million for the same period ending in 2022. HIVE holds Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH-USD), and Ethereum Classic (ETC-USD) coins on its balance sheet. $38.8 million is in Bitcoin, $0.89 million is in Ethereum Classic, and $40 is in Ethereum. During the period, HIVE sold coins raising $103 million, and recorded a loss of $22 million on those sales. The coins are held with two institutions, one in the US and one in Liechtenstein. These institutions are not named in the accounts; however, HIVE uses the Fireblocks' platform to maintain the safety of these assets. Fireblocks has no known security breaches and insurance to cover future breaches. HIVE accounts for the purchase of mining equipment as an investing activity rather than capex so that they can be revalued yearly rather than depreciated. HIVE registered an impairment charge against the mining equipment of $71 million for the nine months ending Dec 31st, 2022. (note 9) states the reasons as a change in replacement cost and the Ethereum merger. HIVE also reduced the useful life of its equipment from 4 years to 2 years resulting in an accelerated depreciation cost on other assets. HIVE has pre-paid for significant quantities of Mining equipment. It did this to secure equipment and delivery dates; however, these deposits are a contagion risk. In the latest accounts, HIVE recorded a provision of $27 million against the total deposits paid of $37 million. That is a significant hit. (page 11) The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by procuring mining hardware from the larger more established suppliers The only other contagion risk is an investment on the balance sheet of $4.5 million, this investment in Valour Inc was originally for $16 million, but an unrealized loss of $11.5 million has already been put into the accounts (Note 6). In total, HIVE has accounted for almost $40 million in losses due to contagion risk, a significant amount of money lost from the business. HIVE has a related party derivative position (Note 11). In 2021 it received $15 million from US Global Investors Inc for debentures that can be converted into shares, and US Global received 5 million warrants as a fee. The debentures carry an 8% interest rate and are considered a derivative because of the currency risk between US$ and CND$. Frank Holmes is the executive chairman of HIVE, and he bought US Global Investors in 1989 when following an SEC investigation into the company. I do not see any problem here, Frank is a respected long-term investor with an excellent track record. Dilution In May 2022, HIVE conducted a 5 for 1 stock consolidation and issued 1.3 million shares ATM with an average price of C$4.01. HIVE has 83% of its shares owned by the general public, which adds to the likely hood of volatility. The only major institution involved is Invesco, with a 5% holding. HIVE ownership (Simplywall.st) The balance sheet is somewhat precarious; The short-term assets do not cover all liabilities, and the cash on hand does not cover current liabilities. However, it is surprisingly solid, considering the paper losses taken in the last set of accounts. The coins have increased to $58 million since the accounting date. It is a difficult question for these companies when they should sell the coins. They risk losing out on significant appreciation when they go up in value but run the risk of Chapter 11 if the price falls. HIVE Balance Sheet (Author Database) Conclusion HIVE currently has one income stream, Mining Bitcoin. The Ethereum merger took away the income from mining on that Blockchain. The barrier to entry for new Bitcoin miners is low, and additional capacity on the network grew throughout 2022, despite the fall in the price of BTC. The Bitcoin amount per hash unit decreases as capacity or hash rate grows. This reduces HIVE's income and may require ongoing investment in new mining power. HIVE, like other miners, is looking for new income streams. It has chosen to use its heat to develop a controlled agriculture site and to heat an adjacent building. Neither of these ventures is scalable, and the controlled agriculture companies I follow are not doing well. HIVE is managing its balance sheet well with limited dilution and has sold the Bitcoins it has mined to fund its operation, which I like. It has booked significant impairment costs against future mining equipment and on investments in other companies but hopefully will not repeat that error. I like how HIVE throttles back its operation when the price of energy rises and how they have sites in colder regions. A good year for Bitcoin will likely mean a good year for HIVE; however, they are not my chosen miner to invest in. I do not believe their attempts to produce extra income from the greenhouse and the swimming pool manufacturer are significantly scalable to make a real difference to this company. In the long term, mining will become ever more difficult, and the income from each mining rig will get smaller. HIVE will continue to follow the Boom and Bust of Bitcoin as it has no other income stream. I want to invest in a miner that makes a lot out of the Boom but has something else in line for the bust.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4594140-hive-blockchain-blood-on-crypto-streets-is-it-time-to-buy-miner?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11755131.jpeg

42387698,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQnvz9,1681492553,Crypto Market Maker DWF Labs’ More Than $200M in Deals Blur What ‘Investing’ Means,"The giants of crypto venture capital are mostly a well-known group of firms that've been around for years, companies such as A16Z, Paradigm, Pantera Capital and Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk's parent).  So the quick and loud emergence of a firm called DWF Labs as a seemingly large player in the space over the past few months caught many by surprise. It announced through press releases and media organizations such as CoinDesk and The Block a slew of investments in projects including $40 million for internet alternative provider Tomi, $40 million for artificial intelligence-related token Fetch.AI and $10 million in AI-focused crypto data project CryptoGPT.  But a closer examination reveals DWF, whose founders made their money as crypto high-frequency traders, isn't exactly a venture capital firm – not always, at least.  While the recent slew of headlines refer to DWF’s partnerships with crypto projects as ""investments,"" DWF Labs actually functions more like an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk. The company typically approaches a crypto project with a token and offers to buy millions of dollars worth of the token at a discount to market value, according to conversations with several crypto projects that have worked with DWF.  But DWF Labs says it's all a misunderstanding. “There might be some questions on the use of the word ‘investment’,” said DWF Labs Partner Stefano Virgilli. “When we use the word ‘investment,’ to us the most important thing is that if we're purchasing the tokens and they're using the funds to further develop, that's an investment,” he added.  The controversy  Investments in crypto projects typically follow a venture capital model. Projects tap venture firms for capital via funding rounds (i.e., pre-seed, seed, Series A, etc.) and, in turn, the investors receive a portion of the project’s equity. In most cases, particularly in early-stage investments where a project has not yet launched a token, investors will receive a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT), a contract that outlines the tokens allocated to the investor if the project launches a token in the future.  DWF Labs’ investments are more ad hoc in nature, and the company primarily selects for projects that have already launched a token.  While DWF Labs refers to itself as “a global Web3 venture capital and market maker” or “multi-stage Web3 investment firm” in press releases, the deals are often presented as “strategic partnerships” that can include token acquisitions, market making services, pledges to boost a token’s liquidity and trading volume, and additional support with marketing and media presence.  And, even helping projects’ treasuries to sell their token holdings, according to the press release the firm distributed about its launch in September.  In the post, the firm said that “DWF Labs invests in digital asset companies and supports existing markets, enabling digital asset companies to sell their tokens for up-front capital without adverse price impact,” adding that “DWF Labs buys tokens with its own funds, allowing its corporate customers to sell tokens quickly.”  It is quite common in the crypto industry for market-making firms to have venture capital arms. Jump Crypto and Wintermute, two heavyweights in the crypto market-making sector, both began as trading firms. But both have since expanded into cutting venture checks for projects, and even building their own pieces of core infrastructure. (Jump has backed the Wormhole cross-chain bridge and Wintermute has launched its own decentralized exchange.)  However, the industry standard is that these contracts should be separated. Even though the lines between the two divisions can be blurred sometimes by the market makers, some industry observers have grown concerned about DWF's recent activity and seemingly packaging different services under partnerships.  “It’s a massive conflict of interest,” Walter Teng, research firm Fundstrat’s vice president of digital assets, told CoinDesk. “If you invest, you want the token’s price to go up. If you market make, you can manipulate the price to go up by spoofing.”  “All of their ‘investments’ are poorly disguised agency OTC (over-the-counter) trades,” a market making firm’s executive, who asked not to be named due to company policy, told CoinDesk. “They make a big announcement about ‘partnerships, investments’ or some other nonsense, but in reality it is a way for token projects to sell their treasury without announcing that they are selling their treasury.”  DWF managing partner Andrei Grachev defended the firm’s token maneuvers in a recent tweet, calling it “dumb” if a market maker (MM) leaves all the acquired or borrowed assets in a wallet, because an “MM should create markets, provide depth, improve order execution instead of doing nothing and waiting when the market is skyrocketing to execute its call options.”  DWF Labs’ strategy  DWF Labs launched in September as an investment-focused arm of Digital Wave Finance, a top high-frequency trading firm that trades spot and derivatives on over 40 exchanges, according to the firm’s press release.  Grachev told CoinDesk that DWF Labs’ funding comes from the money earned from profits of the high-frequency trading business. Grachev worked as crypto exchange Huobi's head of office in Russia in 2018, leading the firm's expansion in the country.  Grachev denied that the firm has received any funding from Russia, a rumor circling within the crypto industry.  Grachev said the firm has multiple types of investments, some with token lockups, others without vesting period, and focuses on projects with tokens. “We prefer to have tokens but we also have several equity deals,” said. “But, frankly, with equity … it is not our strong side,” he said.  While he said that DWF Labs “usually do not include market-making deals in our venture side,” later he admitted that “we have pure investments without market making, we have market-making [agreements] without investment, and we have [them] combined.”  “As a market maker, of course we support our portfolio. If we invest, we will provide much more liquidity to the project compared to if we don’t invest,” Grachev said.  When asked about DWF’s investment strategy and due diligence, Grachev talked about focusing on five sectors – traditional finance (TradFi), decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, centralized exchanges (CEX) and artificial intelligence (AI) – and aiming to “have stakes in all major chains (...) in order to have access to their ecosystems.” The firm looks for projects with “life and traction,” he said, checking social media posts and what exchanges their token is listed on.  ""If a project is listed on BitFinex, Coinbase or Binance, then the project is proven and good because these exchanges have very strict due diligence and very strict policies of listing,"" he added.  Grachev also said DWF doesn’t usually participate in specific venture rounds. “We just approach them,” he says.  CoinDesk viewed a series of messages between DWF Labs and a crypto project that showed a member of the DWF Labs team offering to invest in the project and provide free market-making services. DWF told the project it could invest via a direct OTC purchase of liquid tokens from the project’s treasury, or with a lockup period and market-making services.  Messages from the market maker to another project showed that DWF offered to buy tokens in daily tranches without any lockup period at a discount or in one installment with a one-year lockup at a steeper discount. According to the message, DWF promised to help list the token on South Korean exchanges including Binance Korea, with which the firm has “good relationship,” create options trading and “build narrative” leveraging DWF’s team and media presence.  There were several past announcements when DWF mashed investments and market-making deals.  One instance was its strategic partnership announcement with derivatives trading platform Synthetix. According to a press release on March 16, the firm said it acquired $15 million of the project’s native token SNX “aimed at boosting liquidity and market making,” adding a quote from Grachev that “we are thrilled to invest in Synthetix.”  Blockchain data shows that DFW’s wallet – labeled by crypto intelligence firm Nansen – received 5.3 millions of SNX directly from Synthetix’s treasury wallet between March 14 and March 16. Then, the firm transferred all tokens to Binance in multiple transactions March 16-20.  In November, DWF announced a $10 million investment in the TON ecosystem. The firm’s press release said the “strategic partnership” with the project extends to “an investment, token development, market creation and exchange listing.” The partnership also includes “50 seed investments scheduled over the next 12 months,” doubling the TON token’s trading volume in the first three months of the partnership, and developing an OTC market “to let buyers and sellers complete large transactions.”  Another case is the firm’s investment into Web3 influencer platform So-Col. According to a report in the crypto-focused publication The Block and cited on DWF’s website, DWF invested $1.5 million in “a round” by purchasing So-Col’s native token SIMP in February. Irene Zhao, So-Col’s founder, said the tokens have a one-year vesting period ending in February 2024. The post does not mention other services besides investing.  However, Nansen’s blockchain data on the Ethereum blockchain shows that DWF’s crypto wallet received 3.3 million SIMP tokens between March 6 and March 24. Within the same period, DWF sent some 2.6 million tokens to KuCoin exchange, then transferred the rest to an unknown wallet on March 30. After the announcement on March 28, SIMP almost doubled from around 1.7 cents in a week, then started to plummet on April 4 towards 1 cent, per CoinGecko data.  CoinDesk reviewed Telegram messages of a So-Col representative saying that they decided to work with DWF Labs because besides serving as a market maker DWF also invested in the project directly helping to extend the startup’s runway.  Sending tokens to exchanges  Grachev said that DWF Labs keeps most of its funds and investments on CEXs, and transferring tokens to an exchange does not indicate the company will sell.  “We keep all of our inventory, almost all of our inventory, not only our investments but our own funds on exchanges,” he said.  However, keeping supposedly long-term investments on exchanges is a worrying sign for some industry experts, hidden from savvy blockchain analysts and traders whether DWF sells tokens or uses them for market making purposes.  “It’s a red flag,” a founder, who asked to remain anonymous, of a crypto analytics firm with former market-making experience told CoinDesk. “They [DWF Labs] market them as an investment, and then claim to do ‘market making’ so they can keep funds on exchanges and just dump.”  It's hard to opine on where a firm like DWF should draw the line between VC and market making. Perhaps a page from the TradFi banking playbook could work. In that realm, investment banking and trading/research is separated by a so-called Chinese wall. Where that line might need to be drawn for crypto investment firms is unclear.  In the interview, Grachev admits his “biggest mistake” was not properly explaining his firm’s operating philosophy and investment process. “We need to be more open. I want [the community] to know how we work and then let people decide who is right and who is not right,” he said.  Tracy Wang and Ian Allison contributed reporting.

42411169,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQN6,1681490938,Web2’s Lesson for AI: Decentralize to Protect Humanity,"This is going to sound presumptuous coming from a guy who doesn’t write code, let alone have any direct experience in machine learning or artificial intelligence research.  But I gotta say it: The recent alarmist demand for a six-month pause or even a militarily enforced shutdown in AI research – from people with experience, money and influence in the artificial intelligence industry – is founded on some fundamentally flawed thinking that will encourage the same destructive outcome for humanity that we seek to avoid. That the U.S. government is simultaneously orchestrating a crackdown on the crypto industry, a field of open-source innovation that develops the kind of cryptography and network coordination technologies needed to manage AI threats, makes this an especially dangerous moment for all of us.  These doomsayers are computer scientists, not students of economic history. The issue is not, in and of itself, that an out-of-control AI could evolve to kill us all. (We all know that. For decades, Hollywood has taught us that it is so.) No, the task is to ensure that the economics of AI don’t intrinsically encourage that horrific result. We must prevent concentrated control of the inputs and outputs of AI machines from hindering our capacity to act together in the common interest. We need collective, collaborative software development that creates a computational antidote to these dystopian nightmares.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The answer does not lie in shutting down AI innovation and locking ChatGPT creator OpenAI, the industry leader that has taken the field to its current level of development, into pole position. On the contrary, that’s the best way to ensure the nightmare comes true.  Web2’s lessons  We know this from the debacle of Web2, the ad-driven, social platform-based economy in which the decentralized Web1 internet was re-centralized around an oligarchy of all-knowing data-aggregating behemoths including Google, Facebook and Amazon. They became the beneficiaries of what Shoshana Zuboff has dubbed “surveillance capitalism,” and we humans became its victims, a passive source of personal data that is extracted from us and recycled into behavior-modifying algorithms.  All of this happened, not because the platforms were morally inclined to abandon Google’s “Don’t Be Evil” maxim, but because the logic of the market pushed them into this model. Ads provided the revenue, and an ever-growing pool of users on their platforms provided the data with which the internet titans could shape human behavior to maximize returns on those ads. Shareholders, demanding those exponential gains continue, pressured them to double down on this model to “meet the number” each quarter. As network effects kicked in and the platforms attracted more users through a self-reinforcing growth function, the data extraction models became more lucrative and more difficult to abandon as Wall Street’s expectations were benchmarked ever higher.  Read more: Brands Will Save Crypto? Be Careful What You Wish For  This exploitative system will go into overdrive if AI development occurs under the same monopoly defaulting structure. The solution is not to halt the research but to incentivize AI developers to devise ways to subvert that model.  Updating capitalism  For centuries, the market capitalism system encouraged competition among entrepreneurs for market share, generating wealth and productivity for all. It fostered wealth disparities but, in the long run, with the help of antitrust, union and social safety net laws, it produced unprecedented gains in wellbeing worldwide.  But the system was built for an analog economy, one that revolved around the production and sale of physical things, a world where the constraints of geography put a burdensome cost of capital on growth opportunities. The internet age is very different. It’s one of self-reinforcing network effects, where the efficiencies of software production allow market leaders to rapidly expand market share at very low marginal cost, and where the most valuable commodity is not physical, such as iron ore, but intangible – it’s human data.  We need a new model of decentralized ownership and consensus governance, one that’s built on incentives for competitive innovation but has, within it, a self-correcting framework that drives that innovation toward the public good.  Inspired by Jacob Steeves, a founder of decentralized AI-development protocol Bittensor, I believe crypto technology can help define what that future looks like – even if we need guardrails for it.  “We’re saying let's build open ownership of AI,” Steeves said of Bittensor’s tokenized decentralized building model for AI on this week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast. “If you can contribute, you can own it. And then, let's let the people decide.”  The philosophical idea is that sufficiently decentralized ownership and control would prevent any single party from dictating AI development and that, instead, the group as a whole would opt for models favorable to the collective. “If we all had a piece of this, then this thing is not going to come back and hurt us because at the end of the day the fundamental currency of AI, the fundamental ownership part is in your wallet,” Steeves said.  Overly utopian? Maybe. The long list of scams in crypto history mean that many will instinctively imagine a crypto-AI model being hijacked by nefarious actors.  But if we’re going to forge a common project based on open-source innovation and collective governance, the economic phenomena that look most like what we need are the ecosystems that have sprung up around blockchain protocols.  “Ethereum and Bitcoin are the largest supercomputers in the world, measured in hashes,” Steeves said. “Those networks – for good or ill, whether or not you position yourself on either side of the power debate – are mega structures. They are the largest computing mega structures that humanity has ever created … they're hundreds of times larger than the data warehouses of companies like Google.”  Regulatory capture  OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT and GPT1-through-4 large language models (LLM), is structured very differently from those blockchain ecosystems. It’s a private company, one that has just taken in a $10 billion (with a B) investment from tech giant Microsoft.  And while its CEO Sam Altman has not, as yet, joined Tesla CEO and OpenAI investor Elon Musk as one of more than 25,000 signatories to an open letter calling for a six-month pause in AI development, many believe that if that letter’s demands were implemented, the company would be a direct beneficiary, making it harder for any competitor to challenge OpenAI’s dominance while earning Altman’s company control of AI development going forward.  Read more: ChatGPT Will Kill Search and Open a Path to Web3  “The letter serves to rally public support for OpenAI and its allies as they consolidate their dominance, build an extended innovation lead and secure their advantage over a technology of fundamental importance to the future,” wrote cryptocurrency pioneer Peter Vessenes in a CoinDesk op-ed this week. “If this occurs, it will irreparably harm Americans – our economy and our people.”  Imagine if, Vessenes wrote, “in 1997, Microsoft and Dell had issued a similar ‘pause’ letter, urging a halt to browser innovation and a ban on new e-commerce sites for six months, citing their own research that the internet would destroy brick-and-mortar stores and aid terrorist finance. Today we'd recognize this as self-serving alarmism and a regulatory capture attempt.”  OpenAI is now based on a closed system but the LLM approach to machine learning is now out in the wild and being replicated in all sorts of ingenious ways. How on earth is an agreement by U.S. scientists, or even an act of Congress, going to stop this technology’s advance – especially by criminal actors backed by rogue states with every reason to ignore the United States’ entreaties?  Wrong direction  Pair this with the U.S. government’s recent hostility toward crypto, manifest in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s string of actions against industry leaders and in the sanctions against the open-source Tornado Cash protocol, and a worrisome convergence emerges. That crypto companies are now leaving U.S. shores is more than a threat to the digital asset industry. It’s a blow against the very form of open-source innovation that’s needed to avoid AI’s dangerous capture by self-serving centralized interests.  For all the losses suffered by token speculators recently, the waves of money that chased those riches funded some of the biggest leaps in cryptography of all time. Zero-knowledge proofs, for example, likely to play a role in how we protect sensitive information from ubiquitous snooping by AI, have advanced by many magnitudes more than they did in the pre-crypto era.  There’s a wisdom-of-the-crowd advantage, too, that comes from crypto’s permissionless innovation ethos. Non-conforming fringe ideas tend to bubble up more easily than those directed from on high by corporate leadership. OpenAI’s innovation structure is very different from that. Sure, it figured out how to tap into the internet’s massive array of data and how to train an incredibly effective LLM on it. But having abandoned its open-source, nonprofit status, it is now a closed, black box operator, beholden to the profit-maximizing demands of its new corporate investor.  We have a choice: Do we want AI to be captured by the same concentrated business models that took hold in Web2? Or is the decentralized ownership vision of Web3 the safer bet? I know which one I’d pick.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Michael J.

42411168,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLQGU,1681489379,AI Boosters Would Sacrifice Humanity for a Simulacra - as Long as They're in Control,"Humans have always had a strange relationship to their technology. Whether it’s fire or the written word or artificial intelligence (AI), the things we create to empower and extend ourselves often come to seem like strange outside forces, their transformative impact on our lives and minds as profound and unpredictable as that of capricious gods.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In the 21st century, there are many technologies whose impact we still haven’t adjusted to, like social media. Others, particularly artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, are not yet fully developed but stand to have major impacts on how we live. That includes shaping the way we think about the world: Human groups are often profoundly influenced by the built-in biases of the technologies they rely on. (This relationship between mankind and its technology was the main focus of my academic career before turning to journalism.)  The cases of AI and cryptocurrency are particularly enthralling. Their respective technological underpinnings each map to much broader ideas about society and even individual morality. The two sets of ideas also seem in many ways diametrically and fundamentally opposed. On the one hand, you have crypto ideologues, often some variety of libertarian; on the other, you have the techno-utopianism of the AI boosters.  The core principle of blockchain tech is universality. The entire point is that everyone, everywhere, can access these tools and services, whether someone in authority is OK with that or not. A corollary to this principle is valuing privacy very highly. These values lead to a significant amount of chaos, but the underlying ethos includes a belief that such chaos is productive, or at least a necessary trade-off for human flourishing.  Artificial intelligence communities tend towards a much different view of the world, also closely tied to the structure of the technology. The basic role of an AI is to observe human behavior and then copy it, in all its nuance. This has many implications, but major ones include the eventual end of human labor, technical centralization and a bias towards total data transparency.  These may seem innocuous or even positive. But to put it bluntly, the implications of AI’s technical biases seem quite grim for humanity. That makes it all the more fascinating to watch AI boosters not just embrace those grim implications, but work tirelessly to make them real.  You aren’t human anymore  The most glaringly malevolent manifestation of the AI worldview might not look like one. Worldcoin is seemingly a cryptocurrency project designed to distribute a “universal basic income” (UBI) in exchange for harvesting uber-sensitive biometric data from vulnerable populations.  But while it’s a “crypto” on the surface, Worldcoin is actually an AI project in substance. It’s the brainchild of Sam Altman, also the founder of OpenAI. Its goal of identifying individuals and giving them UBI is premised on a future in which artificial intelligence takes over all human jobs, requiring a centrally-administered redistribution of AI-generated wealth.  See also: Why Everyone Is Mad at Sam Altman's Worldcoin (2021)  One often overlooked implication of this is that in this future, people like Sam Altman will be the ones who still have meaningful work and individual freedom, because they’ll be running the machines. The rest of us, it seems, will have to subsist on worldcoin.  If that sounds dehumanizing, try this on for size: human rights for machines. In an essay published in The Hill on March 23, contributor Jacy Reese Anthis declared, “We need an AI rights movement.” As many pointed out, that’s philosophically suspect because there’s no compelling evidence that artificial intelligences will or can ever have any subjective experience, or know suffering in a way that would necessitate protection.  The AI hypesters have gone to great lengths to obscure this question of subjective consciousness. They have floated an array of maliciously misleading arguments that AIs – including, absurdly, currently existing language models – possess some form of consciousness, or the subjective experience of being in the world. Consciousness and its origins are among the all-time great mysteries of existence, but AI advocates often seem to have a superficial understanding of the issue, or even of what the word ""consciousness"" means.  Anthis, a co-founder of something called the Sentience Institute, repeats in his essay the cardinal logical fallacy of much flawed AI research: uncritically accepting the visible output of AI as a direct sign of some internal subjective experience.  As nuts as the call for AI rights is, we still haven’t touched the furthest fringes of misguided AI hypedom. In late March, no less a figure than aspiring philosopher-king Eleizer Yudkowsky suggested that his followers should be prepared to commit violent attacks on server farms in order to slow or stop the advance of AI.  Some may be surprised I include Yudkowsky with pro-AI forces. Yudkowsky is the leader of an “AI Safety” movement that grew out of his “rationalist” blog LessWrong, and argues AI may potentially take over the world and destroy humanity. The validity of those ideas is up for debate, but the important thing here is that Yudkowsy and his so-called rationalist peers don’t oppose artificial intelligence. The Yudkowskyites believe AI can bring about a utopia (again, a utopia they would be in charge of) but that it carries serious risks. They are fundamentally AI advocates dressed in skeptics’ clothing.  That contrasts with the more genuine and grounded skepticism of figures including Timnit Gebru and Cathy O’Neil. These researchers, who do not have nearly the following of Yudkowsky, aren’t worried about a far-future apocalypse. Their concern is with a clear and present danger: that algorithms trained on human behavior will also reproduce the flaws of that behavior, such as racial and other forms of discrimination. Gebru was notoriously fired from Google for having the temerity to point out problems with AI that threatened Google’s business model.  You may note the similarity here to other ideological movements, particularly the related ideas of “effective altruism” and “long-termism.” Emile P. Torres, a philosopher based at Leibniz University in Germany, is among those who describes the deep alignment and affiliations between Yudkowskyites, “transhumanists,” effective altruists and longtermists, under the acronym TESCREAL. As just one tiny example of this alignment, FTX, the fraudulent crypto exchange staffed substantially by effective altruists and led by a man who pretended to be one, made large donations (using allegedly stolen funds) to AI safety groups, as well as other long–termist causes.  This package of worldviews, Torres argues, boils down to “colonize, subjugate, exploit, and maximize.” In Worldcoin in particular we see a preview of the implacable authoritarianism of a world where machines endlessly copy human behaviors, and replace them – except for the handful of humans with their hands on the tiller.  See also: The Intersection of AI and Crypto | Money Reimagined  There is much more to be said here, but for those in the crypto world, one declaration from the TESCREAL axis deserves particular attention. In a very recent essay, Yudkowsky declared that the future threat of dangerous artificial intelligence could require ""very strong global monitoring, including breaking all encryption, to prevent hostile AGI behavior.""  In other words, to these folks the privacy and autonomy of humans in the present must be discarded in favor of creating the conditions for safe and continuing expansion of artificial intelligence in the future.

Crypto derivatives are financial contracts such as futures and options that relate to cryptocurrencies. They are popular because they allow market participants to hedge their positions or to speculate on market direction.  Derivatives trading accounted for about 74% of the roughly $4 trillion crypto market volume last month, the data show. While the bulk of derivatives trading took place on centralized exchanges (CEX), decentralized exchanges (DEX) accounted for $68.7 billion, with dYdX taking a 62.6% share.  “We expect decentralized derivatives protocols to continue performing well and gain market share in the next quarter,” said CCData in a report.  There has been an increasing trend of spot DEXs adding derivatives trading to their platforms as they notice the potential of derivative DEXs, according to CCData.

Mastercard dropped its first NFTs, a free-to-mint collection aimed at helping music artists in Web3. Both projects are powered by Polygon, which continues to rack up more mainstream wins.  Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s financial secretary said that now is the “right time” to push for Web3 adoption and Razer is using its expertise as a multi-billion dollar global gaming tech company to launch a Web3 venture fund aimed at fostering up-and-coming games and developers.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Upvoting NFTs: Reddit has released its Gen 3 NFT collection, involving over 100 artists in creating new avatar tokens. All of Reddit’s NFT releases, which feature the social platform’s logo character “Snoo,” have been met with high demand, with over 7.4 million unique wallets snapping up the collectible avatars to date, according to Dune.  Crashing the site: The collection was so popular at launch on Reddit’s NFT marketplace that it temporarily crashed the site for a period of time.  Plus for Polygon: Reddit’s latest release is a win for Polygon, which powers its NFT ecosystem. Polygon has continuously pledged to facilitate mass adoption of Web3, and its recent partnerships with Nike and Starbucks have encouraged first-time and returning buyers to transact in Web3.  Hong Kong is bullish on Web3: The city’s financial secretary, Paul Chan, has signaled a warmness toward embracing Web3 and blockchain technologies, touting its “great development potential.” Despite volatility amongst the greater crypto market, Chan said that now is the “right time” to push for Web3 adoption, and plans to focus on Web3 technology in planning Hong Kong’s budget.  Blockchain budget: In February, Chan set aside $6.4 million of Hong Kong’s annual budget to be put towards investing in Web3 innovation.  But China is still cautious: While Hong Kong is warming up to Web3, China remains hesitant to fully embrace blockchain applications. The country has been notoriously strict when regulating cryptocurrencies, banning crypto transactions, mining and trading entirely. But in January it enabled smart contract functionality for its central bank digital currency (CBDC) and recently launched a state-backed “digital asset” marketplace.  Razer sharp: Global gaming tech company Razer has launched a Web3 venture fund to help early-stage projects building blockchain-based gaming infrastructure. With Razer’s $3 billion market cap and decades of gaming experience, the zVentures Web3 Incubator (ZW3I) plans to leverage its expertise to support blockchain games and developers, providing access to Razer’s marketing and partnership resources, as well as zVentures’ Web3 partners including leading gaming investment firms Animoca Brands and Griffin Gaming Partners, and software company Amazon Web Services, among others.  For gamers, by gamers: While investment firms including a16z have pumped major coin into the Web3 gaming industry, Razer’s approach to Web3 gaming will use its gaming industry know-how to provide guidance and support for up-and-coming projects.  Mastercard Music Pass NFT: Global payments company Mastercard is releasing a free-to-mint NFT to help support emerging Web3 musicians. The Mastercard Music Pass NFT, created in collaboration with Polygon, is the key to unlocking the Mastercard Artist Accelerator program that provides tools and educational materials for music artists. The pass expands Mastercard’s foray into digital collectibles. It began allowing cardholders to purchase NFTs with fiat through a partnership with MoonPay in June 2022.

ALTS by Adidas is the third phase in its digital collectibles expansion and involves dynamic NFTs with eight different ""ALT[er] egos"" that correspond to different rarity traits and interactive storylines.  How: Holders of NFTs from the first two phases of the Into The Metaverse NFT collection can now burn their NFTs on the adidas website to receive a new ERC-1155 token from the Ethereum-based ALTS by Adidas collection, paying only for gas fees. At the end of the experience, holders will get a unique profile picture (PFP) featuring their unique trait combination.

The withdrawals did not have any negative impact on the Ethereum price trend as the crypto asset is on a surge spree. As of the time of writing, ETH has recorded a price growth above 6% in the past 24 hours, beyond BTC’s 1.77% gain. There is seemingly an improvement in market sentiment around the asset today, causing ETH’s value to skyrocket. This is also evident in the token’s trading volume in the past 24 hours. If this trend continues, the price could surge beyond the $2,500 mark soon. Ethereum Price Trend And Withdrawals As of today, the price of Ethereum has surged over $2,000, its highest level over the past 11 months. This is a substantial increase from its recent price of $1,900 as of yesterday. In the meantime, the Ethereum market sentiments are bullish, particularly after its price surge. This could be due to the Shapella upgrade that took place this week. Ethereum now stands at $2,115, a 5.13% surge over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin still hovers around a 1.77% price increase in the same period. Related Reading: Company Of Legendary Peter Brandt Goes Long Bitcoin, Here’s His Target Price Furthermore, Ethereum’s trading volume is currently up by 25.45%, surpassing that of Bitcoin, which now stands at 9.22%. The surge in Ethereum’s price has also caused a ripple effect on the broader digital asset market. Several other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Binance Coin, have experienced price increases. In the meantime, crypto investors can only watch to see how long this surge in Ethereum’s price will last. But for now, it appears that the digital currency market is once again heating up. Data From Token Unlocks An industry analyst, Colin Wu, noted that the token withdrawal occurred approximately 30 hours after the Shanghai upgrade. But he also stated that the network received about 100,000 ETH deposits afterward. As such, data from Token Unlocks shows that the net staking balance is now 139,000 ETH, worth about $277 million. Related Reading: Little-Known Crypto WOO Outshines DEX Tokens With Surprise 32% Spike The data also shows that about 1.11 million ETH worth $2.35 billion are still on hold for withdrawal at the time of writing. Wu cited in his tweet that 63% of this amount goes to Kraken, whose staking services are currently not functional due to the suspension from the United States Security and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, Coinbase, Huobi, and Lido Finance account for 11%, 5.1%, and 31%, respectively.

42411028,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB47i,1681487875,"NovaWulf Plans to Tokenize Equity of Celsius’ New Firm With $2B Assets, After Takeover","Digital asset investment firm NovaWulf is poised to take over all assets belonging to bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network and roll them into a new company, once its creditors have been paid out.  NovaWulf will manage the new company for five years, which will have a new name and a new board of directors, and will be traded through a fairly untested method of putting tokenized equity on blockchain. The five-year management term can be renewed. The board of directors will be chosen by NovaWulf and the official committee of creditors, which represents their interests in the bankruptcy. The plan could take effect as soon as June 30.  NovaWulf has committed $45 million in the transaction, but the Celsius assets it will manage could be worth as much as $2 billion, according to Marc D. Puntus, co-head of Centerview Partners, the investment banker working with Celsius during the bankruptcy case. The assets in question include Celsius’s mining unit, its loan portfolio, staked cryptocurrency, and other alternative investments, according to court filings.  However, the team will have a big task ahead of it – turning around one of the most spectacular collapses in crypto history. The leadership sees the bankruptcy process as a way to turn over a new leaf, and then some.  ""What I'm really most excited about is the flexibility to be in a position to play offense, when you have an entire industry that's playing defense,"" given that major crypto firms are either in bankruptcy or facing regulatory scrutiny, said NovaWulf co-founder and managing partner Jason New.  Celsius contacted 130 interested parties and signed non-disclosure agreements with 40, before choosing NovaWulf, according to filings.  NovaWulf is related to TeraWulf (WULF), a publicly traded mining company. The two firms share their two co-founders, who don’t have any formal executive roles at NovaWuf, only in the miner – Nazar Khan, who is also the miner’s chief operating officer and chief technology officer, and CEO Paul Prager. NovaWulf's team has had experience with complicated bankruptcies such as Lehman Brothers.  Tokenized equity  The tokenized equity of the new company will be traded on-chain and outside of stock exchanges. It will however have to follow Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules, which should make its workings more transparent. Just a month before Celsius filed for Chapter 11, industry commentators were disapproving of its opacity.  The equity tokens will be sold on the Provenance Blockchain, according to a presentation filed with the bankruptcy court. Figure Technologies will also provide infrastructure for the tokenized securities.  General earn creditors, with claims below $5,000, will see 70% recovery of their claims in liquidity cryptos, the presentation said. Up to 100% of the rest of the assets, minus what is needed to run the new company, will be dispersed to earn creditors with claims over $5,000, who will also receive tokenized securities of the new company.  Total overhaul  Taking on Celsius’ new chapter requires a certain amount of house cleaning: The new firm will have a new name and none of the pre-bankruptcy leaders will be involved, said NovaWulf’s New.  Celsius’s leadership has been slammed for its risky management online and offline, including in a report from a court-appointed examiner after the bankruptcy.  Read more: ‘A Damaged Brand’: Former Celsius Employee on the Crypto Lender’s Mismanagement and Alleged Token Manipulation  The mining business was, in former CEO and founder Alex Mashinsky’s view, a way to increase yield on customer deposits, according to the report. By June 2022, Celsius had lent out $579 million in Celsius Mining, its wholly owned subsidiary that was established in 2020, and forwarded another $70 million loan shortly before the bankruptcy, the report said.  Celsius was also using stablecoins bought with user funds as collateral to fund “the entire mining asset,” said CEO Chris Ferraro in a Slack message, according to the examiners' report. The company was doing the same to prop up other parts of its business.  By spring of 2022, some of the company’s senior management thought that an initial public offering (IPO) of the mining business could be used to plug a $1.1 billion hole in its balance sheet, along with the sale of other “non-balance sheet assets.”  But the value of the mining unit dropped from $2 billion to $2.9 billion in August of 2021, to $500 to $700 million at the time of the bankruptcy, meaning even if an IPO or sale had gone through, it likely wouldn't have sufficed to plug in the balance sheet hole.  Risk management and an overreliance on third parties, known as hosting firms, formed Celsius Mining’s Achilles heel.  The new management will look to vertically integrate the mining business, which now counts about 120,000 machines. At least initially, they will be looking for hosting agreements, but a focus will be to set up their own hosting capacity down the line to better control risks and costs.

42411029,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB416,1681486784,Sweden Drives Final Nail Into Its Bitcoin Mining Industry With Tax Hike,"Sweden, the last remaining stronghold of bitcoin miners in Europe, is abolishing tax incentives for data centers in July – potentially putting the last nail in the coffin for the industry in the region.  Energy prices in Europe have spiked in the past year largely in part due to the war in Ukraine, driving out bitcoin miners. The northernmost regions of Norway and Sweden were some of the last areas where the industry was still profitable and operating – although the crowd had thinned out – as they offer an ideal environment for data centers; cool and home to cheap hydroelectricity.  But not even these remote parts of Europe remained unaffected from the energy crisis, which caused prices to increase and some miners to turn off their operations, at least partly, in 2022.  Read more: Europe’s Last Bitcoin Mining Refuge Is No Longer Viable  Energy prices started to normalize in 2023, but the upcoming tax will likely stop any new investment in Sweden, which is currently home to about 150 megawatts (MW) of mining. The tax will increase from SEK 0.006 ($0.0006) to SEK 0.36 ($0.035) per kilowatt hour (kWh) starting July of this year, according to the financial budget published in November 2022.  Based on the average electricity prices last year, the tax hike could bring the all-in energy cost to $0.093/kWh, said Jaran Mellerud, senior analyst at mining services firm Luxor Technologies. A MicroBT Whatsminer M30s, a moderately efficient and commonly used machine, would be at break-even point given current market conditions, he said.  Hive Blockchain (HIVE), a Canada-based miner with 25% of its energy capacity in Sweden as of the end of 2022, declined to comment on this story. CoinDesk couldn’t find an instance where Hive disclosed the tax hike explicitly in any of its filings. The firm has discussed its disagreement with Swedish Tax Authorities over $32.4 million in VAT that it thinks it should recover.  Norway, which hosts 250-300 MW of mining, also increased its taxes from $0.0086 to $0.015 per kWh in January, said Mellerud.  Not all hope is lost for Norway, as its energy is overall cheaper and the tax hike is more modest, Mellerud said. The industry will continue developing there, said Denis Rusinovich, co-founder of mining consulting firm Cryptocurrency Mining Group.  Looking for ways out  Sweden’s tax hike makes mining in the region “prohibitively expensive in Sweden and could ultimately destroy the industry,” said Mellerud, so bitcoin miners are looking for solutions.  Many miners are looking to diversify elsewhere, as the new tax will drastically reduce their profitability, said Enerhash CEO Daniel Jogg, who operates a site in Sweden. The tax also requires companies to pay in advance for a few months, which creates some serious cash constraints at a difficult time for the industry, he said.  Some miners could try to get through the tax hike by switching to self-mining instead of hosting others’ machines, said Rusinovich.  Others are looking at ways to get around the tax by reusing the heat produced in the data centers such that they are taxed as heat producers, Mellerud said.  Those packing up are also facing an uphill battle, said Rusinovich: “The market of potential buyers has completely dried up and there are only less than a handful of real buyers left.”  Broken trust  It is unclear whether Sweden’s new taxes were intended towards miners or the entire data center industry. The tax hike was proposed by the Swedish Ministry of Finance, which was also pushing for a ban on bitcoin mining in the European Union last year, Mellerud pointed out.  “This could be viewed as an attack on bitcoin mining,” he said.  In 2017, Sweden enacted a 98% tax cut for data centers, looking to attract businesses. Four years later, the industry hasn't created the jobs the country was hoping for, and the macroeconomic environment has changed, said the budget report.  The energy crisis has increased electricity rates for households, and the tax cuts currently in place might actually be taking away energy from other, more job-creating industries in the manufacturing sector, said the budget.  Miners are disappointed by how the tax hike was rolled out, with what seemed like little notice or communication. Firms like Hive tout Sweden as a “stable” jurisdiction, where they don’t worry about abrupt unilateral changes in the regulatory regime.  Microsoft (MSFT), which also operates data centers in the region, has protested the measure’s abruptness, particularly given that the government had commissioned a report on the energy impact of data centers that wasn’t finished at the time of the tax hike decision, according to the budget.  There has been no official communication to the bitcoin miners active in the region, only a page on the tax authority’s website that was updated to show the change, said Rusinovich.  That, plus the fact that the tax will be implemented in the middle of the calendar year, making it hard to plan ahead, has rubbed miners the wrong way. Companies can request a refund for any taxes levied before the start of July, a spokesperson for the Swedish tax agency said.  Enerhash will keep its operations in Sweden because they are still profitable, particularly given its geographic diversification, but they will not be investing additionally. Why would you invest there when the legal framework can change so abruptly, Jogg asked.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/14/sweden-drives-final-nail-into-its-bitcoin-mining-industry-with-tax-hike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eef04fd2bd32e6992fa1fee1d87a69d714712fd8-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11751257,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526888,1681484402,ADA Rallies Higher Gains Following Cardano’s Aiken Launch,"Cardano (ADA) aims higher today, with an over 6% price increase in the last 24 hours. The price rally follows the news of Aiken Launch, an open-source Smart Contract Language and Toolchain for writing smart contracts on Cardano. Aiken aims to simplify and improve the processes of developing smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. The news stirred positive price moves for ADA as the token witnessed a notable price increase in the hours following the announcement. ADA has now recorded an over 15% price uptick on the weekly chart. Updates On The Aiken Launch Cardano announced that it launched Aiken’s alpha phase on April 13. Aiken will solve problems relating to Smart contract writing, including setting up, learning, and using the Haskell Plutus platform on the blockchain. It would improve interoperability between Haskell (a general-purpose programming language) and other off-chain languages. Related Reading: Little-Known Crypto WOO Outshines DEX Tokens With Surprise 32% Spike According to the announcement, Plutus is challenging to use with other off-chain codes. But Aiken would solve this problem by simplifying integration into any off-chain infrastructure stack, leveraging IOG’s research on Plutus, a Smart Contract platform on the Cardano blockchain that allows developers to execute programming from a single Haskell library. Aiken comprises several domain-specific conveniences that make Smart Contract development easy and more efficient. It renders quick compiler feedback and automatic code formatting, including a language server with editor integrations. The announcement noted the Aiken team would run audits to ensure the program meets the expected standard. The feedback from the audit will enable a smoother mainnet launch. ADA Price Surges after Aiken; What’s Next? The ADA community and broader crypto market participants are excited about the Aiken news. As of March 13, ADA closed with a 5.16% price increase, resuming again today with a 6.74% price gain at press time. The community’s reaction reflected the surging trading volume witnessed today. ADA has observed a 61.42% rise in trading volume in the last 24 hours. ADA witnessed a sharp uptick in trading volume between April 13, after the Aiken launch announcement, and April 14. The trading volume increased rapidly from $371.43 million on April 13 to $716.97 million today, April 14. That suggests higher network and trading activity after the Aiken unveiling. Related Reading: Company Of Legendary Peter Brandt Goes Long Bitcoin, Here’s His Target Price Some observers believe this development may lead to a bullish sentiment for ADA as it could attract more utility to the token. ADA price is trading at $0.4378, with a 6.74% increase over the past 24 hours. Also, the token’s 7-day price gain has increased to 15.63%, placing it in the seventh position among the top-gaining cryptocurrencies today. According to technical indicators, ADA price has crossed all moving averages, a bullish signal for the token. The Oscillators point towards a strong buy direction, while the coin price is above the primary pivot points S1 (0.3280), S2 (0.2571), and S2 (0.14550). It indicates the bulls are in control of the market, with their activity pushing the token price forward. If the current bullish sentiment sustains, ADA might edge closer to the $1 price level.

The country’s 2023 Spring Budget, released in March, said the government wanted to “lead on the future of web technology, sometimes known as Web3 or the metaverse.” The new tech department, set up in February, will lead the charge in this work. The department’s work will not focus on specific technologies like blockchain and virtual reality but will instead look at potential economic growth opportunities, investment and business models associated with concepts including the Metaverse and Web3, along with implications for regulation, according to the source.  The metaverse, which is a collection of virtual worlds where people can buy and sell things, was described as a $13 trillion opportunity by investment bank Citigroup. Meta Platforms – formerly known as Facebook – dove into the sector, shifting much of its operations to focus on building the metaverse, though the recent crypto winter has put a damper on its growth.  “The Government is committed to ensuring the U.K. is ahead of the curve on the future of web technology and maximising the potential of Web3 and Metaverse,” A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said. “Across the board, our teams are working to deliver a pro-innovation approach, maximising the potential of new technologies while minimising any harms to the economy, security, and society.”  The U.K. government has said its science and technology framework will be supported by more than 370 million British pounds (US$463 million) in new funding ""to boost infrastructure, investment and skills for the U.K.’s most exciting growing technologies, from quantum and supercomputing through to artificial intelligence.”  It's not clear how much of that money has been dedicated to the tech department and its metaverse work. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who had previously vowed to turn the country into a crypto hub, said the department was put in place to turn scientific and technical innovations into “practical solutions to the challenges we face.”  The Government has already provided significant funding to support immersive technology. It has provided £39.3 million (about $48.8 million) to develop immersive reality, a Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said.

Yassine Elmadjra Shares His Thoughts On Bitcoin In an interview, the Ark Invest Analyst stated that Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset in the last decade.

Related Reading: Solana Sparkles With Highest 24-Hour Gain Among Top 10 Cryptos He highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience despite market uncertainty and financial chaos, pointing to the fact that Bitcoin is in the same breath as gold as a store of value. Elmandjra notes that although a 20-fold increase might sound too optimistic, it is achievable based on Bitcoin’s origin. The analyst believes the digital asset sector is growing rapidly and will be more relevant in the coming years since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are already enjoying increased institutional adoption. However, regulatory issues and restrictions are a challenge to the advancement of the digital economy. Balaji Srinivasan, the former CTO of Coinbase, also placed a bet on Bitcoin with James Medlock last month of 1 BTC and $1 million USDC. The terms are if Bitcoin fails to hit $1 million by June 17, 2023, Medlock wins the bet. However, if it does, Srinivasan will hold onto his 1 BTC and $1 million USDC. This bet reflects the tremendous belief that BTC enjoys from investors worldwide. Where is BTC Headed? Bitcoin is in an uptrend on the daily chart today, consolidating on its gains from yesterday’s closing price of $30,399. It is trading at the $30,824 price level, forming higher highs on the daily chart. BTC is above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), with bullish sentiment in the short and long term. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 72.04, firmly in the overbought region and highly bullish. Its trading volume is up by over 6.5% in the last 24 hours, indicating interest from traders.

The SEC proposed expanding the definition of the word “exchange” in January 2022 to capture a broader swath of trading activity in the U.S. At the time, the agency said in its proposed rulemaking that certain entities engaging in trading activity were not regulated as exchanges, creating a “regulatory disparity.”  The securities agency read last year’s comment letters from the crypto industry calling the initial proposal an overreaching power grab that failed to provide enough clarity about its meaning to be legitimate. A divided commission voted 3-2 Friday to approve what amounts to a response to that criticism. The updated proposal now uses more direct language that includes DeFi in the widening definition of regulated exchanges, and it details its estimates on how much that change is expected to cost the industry.  The specific changes will be published Friday.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler contends that most crypto platforms are already operating as unregistered securities exchanges, with or without the latest tweaks to the definition of what it means to be an exchange. But he and the commission are poised to “reiterate the applicability of existing rules to platforms that trade crypto asset securities, including so-called ‘DeFi’ systems,” according to an SEC fact sheet outlining the changes.  “Calling yourself a DeFi platform is not an excuse to defy the securities laws,” he said in Friday's meeting.  SEC officials, speaking to reporters ahead of the meeting, said the reopening and additional information came after a number of market participants asked for more information about the proposed amendments and how exactly they would be applied to crypto assets and DeFi.  The agency isn't looking to actually define DeFi in the rule, according to SEC officials, but will evaluate each situation by how the activity is being handled, including whether there's an intermediary and exactly what service that intermediary is providing. It was the unwillingness to offer clear definitions and examples in the proposal that drew much of the criticism from the two commissioners opposing the changes to the proposal – Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda.  Peirce argued the new text ""doubles down on defects"" from the original, and it ""articulates confusing and unworkable standards."" Noting last year's destruction of so much of the centralized crypto industry, she added that ""it seems perverse to me that we would be encouraging centralization.""  ""We should have gone back to square one and issued a concept release,"" said Peirce, who asked a lengthy series of questions of SEC staff about how the new exchange definition might work and was frequently told that the staff would have to think about the questions and get back to her with more information.  Uyeda – critical of the proposal's ""expansionary and ambiguous language"" – noted the SEC's answer to many of the key questions from those who could be regulated seems to be: ""It depends.""  Gensler reiterated his view that “the vast majority of crypto tokens are securities” and that crypto trading platforms already meet existing requirements for securities exchanges.  “These platforms match orders of multiple buyers and sellers of crypto securities using established, non-discretionary methods,” he said. “That’s the definition of an exchange – and today, most crypto trading platforms meet it. That’s the case regardless of whether they call themselves centralized or decentralized.”  Industry pushback  The crypto industry has long advocated for U.S. rules that can bring certainty to how the companies and activities need to operate, though prominent crypto executives and their lobbyists have also said that the SEC’s position that they need to register and follow existing securities laws won’t work for this industry. The SEC has broadly chosen against a tailored approach to the cryptocurrency sector that would acknowledge how it differs from the rest of finance, with Gensler routinely arguing that longstanding securities laws are sufficient.  The SEC had pushed this exchange-definition rule and other proposals last year that – without detailing its intentions with crypto specifically – had suggested that the agency meant to formalize its reach into the digital assets sector.  Later, the agency became more explicit about having its eyes on digital assets when it issued another proposal in February that could bar investment advisers from keeping assets at crypto firms.  With each proposed rule, the SEC’s walls are closing in on crypto businesses that insist there’s no path for them into regulated finance.  The agency received almost 400 comment letters on this week’s revisited proposal and disclosed 35 staff meetings and calls with Wall Street lobbyists, industry self-regulatory organizations, the Bank of England and others regarding the effort. A reopened comment period gives crypto lawyers and lobbyists another 30 days to argue against the rule before the agency will review those responses and decide whether to approve a final rule.  Even when the new exchange definition didn’t name crypto explicitly, the industry opposed it with the assumption that it had digital assets platforms in mind.  “The proposal fails to adapt to – let alone acknowledge – the fundamentally new ways in which individuals can conduct asset exchanges using DeFi protocols,” the Blockchain Association and the DeFi Education Fund argued in a 2022 letter to the SEC. “Instead, it would improperly apply regulations designed for intermediating exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange to software or software developers.”  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee that oversees the SEC, wrote a letter to Gensler with another committee member that said the agency seemed to be trying “to expand the SEC’s jurisdiction beyond its existing statutory authority to regulate market participants in the digital asset ecosystem, including in decentralized finance.”  Circle Internet Financial sought the chance to ask for more specific rules for crypto.  “In view of the unique architecture of digital asset markets, we suggest that the commission would benefit the most from a wide-ranging concept release focused on digital assets markets and how best to achieve its policy goals in light of the unique architecture of such markets,” the company’s comment letter suggested.  But some were glad last year at the possibility crypto could be folded into this SEC oversight.  “The cryptocurrency industry is rapidly expanding with some industry lobbyists insisting that their offerings and platforms fall outside the securities laws and regulations,” Better Markets, a Washington-based group advocating for tougher protections in the financial system, wrote in a comment letter last year. “But clearly, the commission must apply securities regulation equally to all securities regardless of how novel, ‘innovative,’ popular, or profitable such offerings may be.”  It’s been a tough month for DeFi in U.S. policy circles after the U.S. Treasury Department also made clear last week that DeFi services should be subject to anti-money laundering laws, saying the platforms have been used by criminals and for terrorist financing.

Boba Guys, a popular retail chain that opened in 2011 to sell bubble tea, will further deepen its community and give back to its customers through its Web3 rewards initiative. Utilizing Solana’s high-speed, low-cost network, Boba Guys plans to integrate non-fungible tokens (NFT) and token-gated experiences to help bolster its consumer engagement.  Bin Chen, co-founder of Boba Guys, told CoinDesk that the growing market of Web3 technologies has prompted the retailer to offer its customers unique experiences utilizing on-chain technology. He also hopes to onboard as many customers – whether they be new to Boba or Web3 – in the process.  “People that come into our stores may not know a single thing about Web3, Solana, blockchain or any of those things, just the same way that people that come into Boba Guys may not know anything about boba,” said Chen. “We have that same approach with how we’re doing Web3.”  Josh Fried, head of commerce business development at the Solana Foundation, said in a press release that its partnership with Boba Guys will help accelerate the development of Web3 loyalty programs across the Solana ecosystem.  “Their vision for the future of cafes and retail is a model that could become the standard in the years to come,” said Fried. “This collaboration will show how loyalty programs can be improved for both customers and retailers and create a path for other organizations to follow.”  Fried told CoinDesk the Solana Foundation recently invested $100,000 into Boba Guys to help the company grow its business into Web3.  Other retailers have embraced Web3 loyalty programs to deepen their consumer relationships. In December, Starbucks launched the beta for its Odyssey program, the gamified Web3 loyalty experience. And last month, Web3 community management platform Try Your Best, which helped grow customer loyalty programs for retail brands JuneShine and Topicals, joined the Shopify App Store.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | SPONSORED,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/14/tea-shop-boba-guys-taps-solana-for-on-chain-loyalty-rewards-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68b4885ab62b1149774f2a6b993e248c87c373fa-1600x901.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shares of the miner, under the ticker BTDR, lost almost 30% of their value, trading around $6.81 at the time of publication.  The stock was halted shortly after market open, several times, for volatility. Other crypto mining stocks saw single-digit upticks in their share value at the same time frame.  Bitdeer's merger with a special-purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC), called Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp., was approved on Tuesday.  The Singapore-based firm is one of the largest miners in the world, shows a March prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It has six mining sites across Washington state, Texas, Tennessee and Norway, with a total energy capacity of 775 megawatts (MW) as of the end of 2022, about 200 MW less than what it had estimated in February 2022. Its hashrate or computing power at the end of January stood at a total of 16.2 exahash per second (EH/s), second only to bankrupt Core Scientific (CORZ) and higher than Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA).  About one-quarter of that is used for self-mining, meaning it keeps the bitcoin rewards, whereas the rest is given out for cloud mining, meaning customers rent its machines and reap the rewards.  Read more: Crypto Miner Bitdeer May Extend IPO Deadline by 1 Year  Bitdeer was born out of the world’s largest rig manufacturer, Bitmain. After a spat between the two co-founders, one of them left and took Bitdeer. Another cloud mining firm also affiliated with Bitmain, BitFuFu, is also in the process of going public via SPAC, but has delayed the listing.  Bitdeer's financial performance, as with other bitcoin miners, deteriorated in 2022, in part due to worsening market conditions. The firm reported revenue of $330.3 million and a loss of $62.4 million for 2022, compared with $394.7 million in revenue and a profit of $82.6 million the year before, according to the prospectus filing.  The miner is going public at a better time than last year as market conditions have improved, with bitcoin passing the $30,000 mark and mining equities in many cases outperforming the digital asset in percentage growth.

42421258,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXklY5,1681479016,How CoinDesk Will Use Generative AI Tools,"New tools driven by artificial intelligence (AI) have been grabbing headlines over the past several months. The basic gist of these tools is that in response to specific prompts, they can “create” content (whether text, imagery or something else) much faster than a human ever could. Once they’ve been “trained” on extensive datasets, these tools can essentially predict what a user wants, often with stunning accuracy.  With the right set of queries, chatbots such as ChatGPT can write entire articles about specific topics in mere seconds. AI-driven image generators can instantaneously produce illustrations to represent abstract topics. Still other tools can synthesize video and audio content from the “raw material” of text and images.  This obviously has massive implications for creative fields, and in particular media organizations like CoinDesk. We’ve been researching AI tools for the past few months, while simultaneously observing how other media companies have been using AI. We want to empower our staff to take advantage of these tools to work more effectively and efficiently, but with a process that safeguards our readers from the well-documented problems that can arise with AI content – as well as the rights of the original content creators on which the generative content is based.  There are several use cases for AI in the process of creating content. This article deals with the main ones that are relevant to CoinDesk’s content team. It does not cover every use case, and does not speak to workflow outside of the process of content generation.  Generative text in articles  Current AI chatbots can create text from queries very quickly. Users can also customize the text with adjustments to the query — complexity, style, and overall length can all be specified.  However, an AI cannot contact sources or triage fast-breaking information reliably. While it performs some tasks extremely well, AI lacks the experience, judgment and capabilities of a trained journalist.  AI also makes mistakes, sometimes serious ones. Generative tools have been known to “hallucinate” incorrect facts and state them with confidence that they’re correct. They have occasionally been caught plagiarizing entire passages from source material. And even when the generated text is both original and factually correct, it can still feel bland or soulless.  At the same time, an AI can synthesize, summarize and format information about a subject far faster than a human ever could. AI can almost instantaneously create detailed writing on a specific subject that can then be fact-checked and edited. This has the potential to be particularly useful for explanatory content.  Given its limitations and the potential pitfalls, the writing of an AI should be seen as an early draft from an inexperienced writer. In more illustrative terms, an AI tool is comparable to an intern who can write really fast. The analogy is apt: Typically, interns need a great deal of supervision in their work. They are often unfamiliar with the area they’re writing about and the audience they’re writing for, occasionally leading to serious errors. The editor assigned to their work needs to edit their work carefully, check the underlying facts and help tailor the article to the audience.  However, with the right editing process, the work of an intern can be made publishable relatively quickly, especially if the intern has command of the English language (something AI excels at). Similarly, with the right safeguards in place that both prioritize a robust editing process and target the specific pitfalls of AI, we believe that sometimes using generative text in articles can help writers and editors publish more information faster than a purely human-driven process.  With that in mind, CoinDesk will allow generative text to be used in some articles, subject to the following rules. The generative text must be:  Run through plagiarism-detection software  Checked that its sources are reliable (The tool must be capable of citing sources.)  Carefully fact-checked by the writer and editor, including quotations  Edited with an eye toward adding the “human” element  Disclosed. The fact that AI contributed to the article must be clear to the reader.  Given the requirements and the inherent limitations of AI with respect to the primary ingredients of journalism (e.g., talking to sources), the number of use cases for generative text are few. However, we see an opportunity for AI to assist in explanatory content, such as in this article here. In every case where generative text is used in the body of an article – whether in whole or in part – the AI’s contribution will be clear through both a disclosure at the bottom of the article and the AI’s byline: CoinDesk Bot.  Generative images  CoinDesk will use generative images in content only if the AI tool has been trained on imagery that the AI creator is licensed to use, is in the public domain, or both (e.g. Adobe Firefly). As ideas like “do not train” make their way to becoming standards, we expect more tools to open up for editorial use.  The use of generative AI imaging tools where the origin of the training material doesn't meet the above standard or is unclear is forbidden. This is due to pending litigation around the use of proprietary imagery as “training” for various AI-driven image generators. We might make an exception in the case when the point of the article is to discuss generative images and the images are used in a way that constitutes fair use, but these would be on a case-by-case basis.  Using a generative image tool to help “inspire” a work of art created by a human is generally OK (this is akin to doodling on scrap paper) with the caveat that the human-created image should not be a de facto copy of the AI-generated image.  Generative voices  AI tools can generate or use human-sounding voices to read copy, effectively turning articles into audio clips or podcasts. Though CoinDesk doesn’t currently employ these tools, we see the practice as an evolution of tools that already exist for the visually impaired. If possible, the use of an AI voice generator will be disclosed in the accompanying show notes.  Social copy  Social copy typically functions as a short summary of an article, crafted for a specific platform. Because of its short length, social copy is relatively easy to fact-check and edit, and some AI text tools may be adept at crafting text in the style of specific platforms. In addition, there is less expectation among social audiences that the text accompanying a linked story is original.  For these reasons, CoinDesk allows AI-generated social copy as long as the person preparing the post edits and fact-checks the copy (which is standard), and for the same reasons we don’t think disclosure is necessary (and would lead to some very clunky tweets). As with use in articles, using generative images in social posts is forbidden.  Headlines  Like social copy, headlines are quickly fact-checked and edited. Because editors will always be directing the process, we view AI-written headlines as suggestions and are thus allowed. Disclosure isn’t necessary because this process does not add any new information, and editors will always check the headlines for accuracy and style. This also applies to subheadings and short descriptions.  Assistance with research  AI may sometimes be able to assist in summarizing long documents such as court filings, research papers and press releases, among others. As long as no part of the text generated is copied to a published article, this is generally allowed with no disclosure needed, with two important caveats:  Journalists should always be skeptical of the facts presented and how they’re prioritized (i.e., any fact that forms the basis of subsequent reporting must be verified).  An AI bot may miss crucial information. Finding valuable information “nuggets” in a court document, for example, is something best left to humans.  AI-generated story ideas  Any ideas generated by an AI will inherently need to be vetted and researched by the reporter or editor, so this is allowed. Unless actual text generated by the AI ends up in the final article, it’s not required to disclose that the idea was originally suggested via AI (although the author still may want to do so).  The future  These are the rules of the road for CoinDesk as we travel forward into an AI-driven future. That road may change direction suddenly, expand to a multi-lane divided highway or perhaps even come to a dead end, so we expect these rules to evolve in the coming months and years. Regardless, we’re determined to tread into this new frontier, but to tread carefully. We want these rules to empower our content team to work smarter, using AI for the very specific tasks that machines are best at, so humans can focus on what they’re best at: journalism.

42387704,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQnwDB,1681479000,Onramp Launches Spot Bitcoin Trust With Multi-Party Custody,"Bitcoin financial services firm Onramp has launched a spot bitcoin (BTC) trust for high-net-worth investors that takes advantage of the cryptocurrency’s multisignature (multisig) capability to enable what Onramp calls multi-party custody – where a group of separate custodians each hold a private key in a multisig arrangement.  Onramp has recruited qualified custodian Kingdom Trust and bitcoin financial services firm Unchained Capital to create a 2-of-3 multisig model, meaning two of those three entities will need to sign a transaction in order to move client funds. The goal is to give clients direct exposure to bitcoin without the hassle of self-custody or the risk of trusting a single custodian.  Each unit of the trust will be equivalent to one BTC and clients will be able to process in-kind redemptions, where they redeem the underlying asset (bitcoin) without triggering a taxable event, according to Onramp.  Whether a bitcoin trust can process in-kind redemptions – essentially letting investors take out the underlying crypto in exchange for their shares – has proven a thorny regulatory question in the past.  In the mid-2010s, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shut down its redemption program after coming under scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  So investors are essentially stuck in GBTC, unless they choose to sell their shares, and shares in the $18.7 billion fund are currently trading at a steep discount to the underlying bitcoin.  Grayscale filed an application to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund, but the SEC last year rejected the application. The investment firm sued the regulatory agency, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the SEC's order.  The SEC has not approved any bitcoin ETFs, only allowing ETFs backed by bitcoin futures contracts.  Tanguma says Onramp will not offer in-kind redemptions until an initial 12-month lockup period has passed. He said the company's multi-party custody arrangement sets it apart from Grayscale and offers a new model for bitcoin custody.  “It's essentially the product GBTC should have been,” Michael Tanguma, CEO and co-founder of Onramp told CoinDesk. “And I believe it will be the future of how bitcoin is custodied.”  When asked whether Onramp would need SEC approval to start the redemptions, and if so why the regulator would approve the plan, Tanguma responded: ""It does not require formal approval because bitcoin is a commodity as per the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission], not a security. With that, Onramp does plan to work with securities lawyers to get opinion letters in place to reduce the 12-month lock-up period for redemptions, and will work with all regulators to make sure Onramp stays compliant in all jurisdictions where it offers its services.""  It bears pointing out that the SEC oversees capital markets including funds that invest in commodities such as gold or bitcoin.  GBTC's lack of a redemption mechanism has been a source of disgruntlement for institutional investors, including Fir Tree Capital Management, which has sued GBTC over the matter, arguing that Grayscale's policy is ""self-imposed.""  “The lawsuit filed by Fir Tree Partners against Grayscale Investments is baseless and without merit,"" a Grayscale spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""We remain steadfast in our belief that the conversion of GBTC to an ETF is the best long-term product structure for investors, and are 100% committed to that endeavor. We look forward to clarifying the numerous mischaracterizations about our company and products in the Delaware Court of Chancery.”  UPDATE (April 17, 16:05 UTC): Adds comments from Grayscale about the Fir Tree Partners lawsuit and details about Grayscale's SEC application to convert to an ETF.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/14/onramp-launches-first-spot-bitcoin-trust-with-multi-party-custody,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/987aab3f598feb08be17c9dd6df104d0782270db-5464x3070.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394473,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8KAJ,1681478695,The Top 10 Most Expensive NFTs of All Time,"The hype over non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that overtook news cycles and crypto markets in 2021 has died down. Despite 2023's cooler market, NFTs continue to generate billions of dollars in trading volume. Sales of certain NFTs are still breaking the million-dollar mark, such as in February when Yuga Labs' “Golden Key” netted $1.6 million. This year also includes the $1.4 million sale of CryptoPunk 5066 and the $1.3 million purchase of a Bored Ape. In 2022 the highest sale of an NFT, CryptoPunk 5822, was for 800 ETH, at the time worth a whopping $23.7 million.  In some rankings you’ll see The Merge by Pak leading the list, but for our methodology we decided to limit the all-time list of most expensive NFTs to sales of single-edition NFTs rather than sales of open-edition NFTs. The Merge is a collection of 312,686 NFTs that were sold to 28,983 collectors over a few days in December 2021 for a total of $91.8 million. Pak also would have made the list for another open edition called “The Fungible” collection, which netted $16.8 million in sales over three days in April 2021. Don’t feel bad for Pak, though. The artist still made the list and holds the No. 2 spot.  Will any sales break into the top 10 most expensive NFTs? Here’s where the competition stacks up:  The 10 Most Expensive NFTs Ever Sold:  Everydays: The First 5000 Days by Beeple – $69.3 million  Clock by Pak – $52.7 million  Human One by Beeple - $28.9 million  CryptoPunk 5822 – $23.7 million  CryptoPunk 7523 – $11.75 million  TPunk 3442 – $10.5 million  CryptoPunk 4156 – $10.26 million  CryptoPunk 5577 – $7.7 million  CryptoPunk 3100 – $7.58 million  CryptoPunk 7804 – $7.57 million  Here’s more information about each of these pricey digital artworks:  1. Everydays: The First 5000 Days by Beeple  The NFT is a digital collage made up of 5,000 individual images that Beeple created every day (hence the title “Everydays”) for over 13 years. It was sold at Christie's auction house for $69.3 million in March 2021, making it the most expensive NFT ever sold.  See Also: MetaKovan, Buyer of Record-Setting Beeple NFT, Explains Why He Spent $69.3M  2. Clock by Pak  This NFT is a clock that tracks the number of days that WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange has been imprisoned and raised funds towards Assange’s legal defense. Clock was sold for $52.7 million in November 2021 to AssangeDAO, who collectively raised the money to buy the piece.     See Also: AssangeDAO Raised $56M and Quickly Split Up. Was It Still a Success?  3. Human One by Beeple  Beeple returns for the No. 3 spot on our list with Human One. This piece is unique in that it has both a physical side and a digital component that changes according to Beeple’s input, and will continue to change throughout the artist’s life. Human One was sold for $28.9 million in November 2021.  4. CryptoPunk 5822 by Larva Labs  The profile pic (PFP) NFT is one of 10,000 unique characters that were created in 2017.

With Bitcoin price approaching the $31,000 mark, investors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly watching to see if this is a sign of a long-awaited thaw in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s recent rally shows no signs of slowing down, as its price via CoinMarketCap stands at an impressive $30,778 with a 1.79% increase in the last 24 hours and a 10.24% rally over the past seven days. Source: CoinMarketCap With such strong momentum, the question on everyone’s mind is: where is Bitcoin headed next? Bitcoin Price: Experts Weigh In On Factors Behind Crypto’s Rally The recent surge in Bitcoin’s price has caught the attention of analysts who are trying to understand what has driven this impressive rise. While some attribute it to the historic trend of bull runs prior to halving events, others point to a combination of factors that have contributed to this increase. According to Wells Fargo equity analyst Jeff Cantwell, Bitcoin’s recent rise is due to three main reasons: First – the current banking turbulence has led many investors to see crypto as a “flight to safety” Second – investors are covering their short positions. Third – a shift towards a “risk-on” mentality among investors, as the prospects of a Fed pivot have increased On the other hand, Forbes suggests that there are numerous factors driving Bitcoin’s surge, including the recent banking instability that has strengthened the belief that decentralized finance options like cryptocurrencies are needed more than ever. With multiple factors at play, it remains to be seen how long this surge will continue and whether Bitcoin will maintain its upward momentum. Cryptocurrencies Rally On Friday As Market Cap Surges On Friday, several top crypto tokens rallied with gains seen in Dogecoin, BNB, XRP, Litecoin, and Solana. The global cryptocurrency market cap also saw a surge, rising to approximately $1.30 trillion, marking a 4.25% increase in the last 24 hours. Despite this rally, Bitcoin’s dominance in the market decreased by 0.95% over the day, currently sitting at 46.30%. At the time of writing, the market cap of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, was around $595 billion.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Ether (ETH) continues to outperform bitcoin (BTC) following the Ethereum network’s Shanghai upgrade, which has proven to be bullish for much of the cryptocurrency market, with many altcoins following suit. Ether is up 6% on the day vs. bitcoin which gained 1%. Bitcoin did briefly cross $31,000 on Friday for the first time since June 2022, marking a 10% gain over the last seven days. Ether rose 13% over the same time frame. Arbitrum (ARB) an Ethereum scaling system, led gains this week, rising almost 30%. According to Sheraz Ahmed, STORM’s managing partner, ARB is bouncing back from the overselling caused by its airdrop in March, which saw the Ethereum layer 2 distribute its long-awaited governance token to community members. The airdrop, however, was plagued with bugs and phishing scams. “The crypto markets are heavily emotionally driven, and we often see overbought/sold tokens based on over-reactions,” said Ahmed.  The tokenization of real-world assets gathers pace, Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report Thursday, which noted that the tokenized gold market surpassed $1 billion in value last month. Tokenization is the process of putting ownership of tangible assets – precious metals being one example – on the blockchain, and thus offering the convenience of buying and selling these assets around the clock as the involvement of traditional brokers is not necessary. Bank of America sees this tokenization – which could also include commodities, currencies and equities –as a “key driver of digital asset adoption.”  Solana Labs’ crypto-forward smartphone Saga will go on public sale May 8, the company behind the Solana blockchain said Thursday. Pre-ordered devices are shipping now. The Android smartphone is a gamble on mobile being imperative to the future of crypto, employees at Solana-focused companies told CoinDesk. It was nearly 10 months ago that Solana first teased the radical potential of a cellphone that doubled as a dedicated crypto hardware wallet, and the possibilities such a product could hold for its entire ecosystem. The new device from Solana Mobile costs $1,000 and is built on hardware from Bay Area smartphone company OSOM. Phonemaker names both big and small – HTC and Sirin Labs among them – have previously failed in their efforts to create a crypto-forward smartphone, setting an ominous precedent for Solana, a device built for and marketed to a single crypto ecosystem.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin continuing to rally despite recent sideways action in Wall Street's tech-heavy index Nasdaq.

11747439,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526863,1681474811,Has Altcoin Season Arrived? Watch Out For These 6 Cryptos,"Ethereum’s (ETH) rally above $2,100 after the Shanghai hard fork has kicked off the altcoin season, according to Crypto Twitter. In addition to ETH, numerous altcoins are posting double-digit gains over the past 24 hours, while Bitcoin has seen a moderate rise. Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, is one of the experts who announced the start of the new altcoin season. Hayes tweeted the 4-hour chart of ETH. Alluding to an interlude by rapper Jay-Z, he wrote, “Allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is ALTSZN!!!”. But it’s not just Hayes who sees altcoins trending to outperform Bitcoin in the coming weeks, other experts do too. Scott Melker aka The Wolf Of All Streets tweeted “beautifully” and shared the Bitcoin dominance chart below. As Melker discussed on Wednesday, there is currently a clear case for altcoin outperformance. Bitcoin dominance has hovered in the 39% to 49% range for years. “When RSI hits overbought and it hits the top, dominance drops and alts outperform. The opposite happens at the bottom,” Melker explains. Related Reading: Little-Known Crypto WOO Outshines DEX Tokens With Surprise 32% Spike Bitcoin was rejected yesterday, as predicted by Melker, at the upper end of the range (at 49%) with an overbought RSI and bearish divergence. Based on this, Melker expects Bitcoin’s dominance to fall again in the coming weeks while altcoins experience big gains. According to the analyst, the only scenario that could prevent an altcoin season is “unless we see a MAJOR breakout and Bitcoin crushes everything.” Watch These 6 Altcoins Melker explained that he is usually extremely conservative when it comes to sharing altcoin charts in his newsletter. “So when I choose to, I have relatively high conviction that alts are relatively safe for the moment,” wrote the analyst, who recommended Fantom (FTM), Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL) last week. Crypto Banter’s Miles Deutscher has his eye on the “newer” coins in particular, which have confirmed his theory in the last 24 hours, writing double-digit price gains. The analyst notes that interestingly, newer coins like Arbitrum (ARB), Aptos (APT) and Optimism (OP) are outperforming their older counterparts. Related Reading: Company Of Legendary Peter Brandt Goes Long Bitcoin, Here’s His Target Price “The market loves gravitating toward the latest shiny thing. The same thing happened last cycle, and it will happen again,” predicts Deutscher, who sees three factors for this. First, new technology offers an improvement over its predecessors. Second, the lack of historical price movement (resistance) is psychologically less limiting in terms of upside potential. Investors believe that the new coins like ARB and APT can replicate the performance of the old coins. Third, current trends have a greater impact on retailer awareness than older narratives. At press time, Arbitrum (+18,8%) was the biggest gainer within the top-100 by market cap. With +10.4% and +9.3%, respectively, Aptos and Optimism are also posting strong gains. However, there are also cautionary voices. The renowned trader “Koroush AK” writes: In a bull market the cycle is clean and predictable. $BTC –> $ETH –> Altcoins –> Trashcoins –> Repeat However we’re not in a full blown bull market, I suspect this will be more like 2019. Expect coins to lag, isolated narrative pumps, sharp crashes and unpredictable ends to the cycle. You will get rekt trading this like a full blown bull market. At press time, the Arbitrum (ARB) token traded at $1.56.

The so-called quantitative tightening ended recently and the cumulative balance sheet of major central banks – the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of England (BOE) and Bank of Japan (BOJ) – has troughed, according to data tracked by macroeconomic research firm TS Lombard and sourced from The Market Ear newsletter.  ""The 'delta of the delta' has reversed lately. Possible tailwind for markets,"" Thursday's edition of The Market Ear said, referring to the dip in the size of the banks' balance sheets.  Expansion of central banks' balance sheets is widely considered bullish for risk assets, including bitcoin.  That's because entities involved in financial markets are often the first recipients of the money newly created through balance sheet expansion, according to a theory proposed by 18th century Irish-French economist Richard Cantillon. These entities use the money received to drive asset prices higher.  The jury is still out on whether the Fed's recent extension of loans to local lenders will result in fresh money creation. Meanwhile, the BOJ continues to print money through bond purchases, compensating for the ECB and BOE's shrinkage.

At press time, the 50-day MA sits at 0.21914262, while the 200-day MA is at 0.20886455, indicating a positive trend that is likely to continue in the short to medium term. With this promising signal, traders may want to consider buying on dips to maximize potential profits. As the purchasing momentum strengthens, the WOO token may attract more buyers and drive prices even higher. However, traders should remain cautious and vigilant for any negative indicators that could put an end to the upward trend. Crypto Market Share Growth And Hybrid Model Drive Price Increase WOO’s price surge can be attributed to a combination of factors, including its growing market share in the crypto industry and its unique hybrid model. Investors are also anticipating more trading volume in the coming months as major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to rise in value. When cryptocurrencies experience upward momentum, both centralized (CEX) and DEX exchanges tend to see increased trading volume.

By combining elements of both CEX and DEX platforms, WOO offers users a unique trading experience that combines the security of centralized exchanges with the transparency and accessibility of decentralized ones. With these advantages, WOO is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory in the highly competitive world of DeFi. -Featured image from Currency.com",POSITIVE,UNI | WOO,ICO | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | WOO,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/little-known-crypto-woo-shines/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Institutional demand is driving the offering of institutional-grade products, with Nasdaq just the latest traditional finance, or TradFi, firm to offer more services in the digital assets space, the report said.  Bank of America says institutional investors remain engaged and focused on the “disruptive nature of blockchain technology over the longer term.”  The bank says it expects crypto company collapses to slow institutional trading as they “reevaluate counterparty risk and ensure that custody, exchange and broker-dealers are separate entities or siloed.”  However, these collapses create a void in the crypto ecosystem that “trusted and experienced TradFi firms offering institutional-grade products may fill,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Enhanced Safeguarding Rules could limit the ability of registered investment advisers to provide custody for clients’ tokens on most crypto-native exchanges, which will further drive TradFi institutions into the space, the report added.  “Our view is that TradFi institutions remain the counterparty of choice,” the bank said.

Data from L2Beat, which tracks activity on layer 2 networks built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, shows over 70,000 ether (ETH), $81 million in USD coin (USDC) stablecoin and $8 million in mute (MUTE) tokens have been locked on zkSync since March 22, when the network first launched.  The TVL amount is distributed among several zkSync-based projects for purchasing ecosystem tokens or providing liquidity to exchanges on the network.  DefiLlama data shows on-chain exchange Syncswap leads in total value locked (TVL) among Era-based services, with over $64 million. It is followed by Velocore at $25 million and Mute at $15 million.  Users can earn up to 80% in annualized rewards by providing liquidity or executing trades on these platforms – which may be driving capital to Era leading to value accrual for tokens such as mute, issued by the Mute DEX.  On-chain derivatives trading has not caught up among Era users so far, data suggests. Era-based Onchain Trade, a derivatives decentralized exchange (DEX), holds just over $2 million in TVL and has seen zero volumes for futures in the past 24 hours. Spot trading on the DEX, however, has racked up $600,000 in volume.  Meanwhile, some meme coins fashioned after the Shiba Inu dog breed – on which popular tokens dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) are based – are seeing cycles of brisk price surges followed by a dump, DEXTools data shows.  As such, more than 7 million transactions have been conducted on the network since launch, The network can process 3.5 transactions per second.  ZkSync is named after the so-called ZK-rollups, which are a type of blockchain scaling system based on cryptography known as zero-knowledge proofs.

Tokenization is the process of putting ownership of tangible assets, such as precious metals, on the blockchain, and offers the convenience of buying and selling these assets around the clock because the transactions do not involve traditional brokers.  Bank of America sees the tokenization of real-world assets, such as commodities, currencies and equities, as a “key driver of digital asset adoption.”  Before the advent of tokenized gold, investors seeking exposure to the gold market could buy exchange-traded-funds (ETF) and futures, or those looking for exposure to physical gold could buy it through dealers, “but these investment vehicles come with drawbacks related to cost and/or liquidity,” the report said.  “Tokenized gold provides exposure to physical gold, 24/7 real-time settlement, no management fees and no storage or insurance costs.” The low minimum investment increases accessibility and “fractionalization enables the transfer of physical gold ownership and value that was not previously possible,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.  Tokenizing the precious metal could increase liquidity and enable investors to rebalance portfolios quickly and efficiently, the note said.  Tokenization of the gold supply chain could benefit ESG-focused investors that need proof that gold came from a specific mine or from a specific region, the report added.

In a tweet, which was actually not intended for the broader public, Brandt revealed that his company Factor LLC is currently taking five long positions, one of which is Bitcoin. Via Twitter, Brandt shared the related chart analysis and stated; “Heading to MN for the summer. Current Factor LLC positions with trailing stops.” Long Nasdaq $NQ_F Long Gold vs. YPY $GC_F $G6J_F Long Bitcoin $BTC Long Gold $GC_F Long London Cocoa (not shown) $LCC_F Bitcoin Price Heading North In response to a question from a Twitter user, Brandt replied, “Sorry, I accidentally tweeted this to my public Twitter feed. It was supposed to be limited to my private Twitter stream.” The analyst’s Bitcoin chart indicates that he expects the Bitcoin price to rise to $40,000. The basis for this forecast is a fulcrum bottom pattern that Bitcoin has successfully formed and from which the price has recently broken out. On Monday, April 10, the legendary analyst shared the chart below and commented on it simply with “Breakout.” The 1-day chart showed that the rise to above $29,200 triggered the buy signal for Brandt. The fulcrum bottom pattern has been discussed a lot lately, as Peter Brandt mentioned this concept in his reports. The structure of the pattern resembles the shape of a simple lever. The bottom is formed in a deep consolidation area after a prolonged downtrend, with a recovery taking place in the middle, but failing. This is followed by several weaker recoveries before the final breakout above the “walls” takes place. Related Reading: Yield Curve Reaches Historic Low, What It Means For Bitcoin Brandt also appears to have drawn a bullish megaphone pattern in the chart. This pattern has also been shared in recent days by analyst Ali Martinez, who most recently wrote: “Bitcoin remains on course for $34,000 as the bullish megaphone pattern continues to dictate BTC’s trajectory!” Unlike Martinez, however, Brandt expects BTC’s rally to continue near $40,000 in his latest analysis. Remarkably, Brandt tweeted on March 20 that he expects a new all-time high for Bitcoin within the next 12 months – meaning a rise above $69,000. Related Reading: Check One, Two: Is Bitcoin Ready For A Mic Drop Rally? “All predictions are just guesses. My guess is that Bitcoin is 12 months away from new ATHs,” wrote Brandt, who also stated that it is “highly unlikely” that BTC will get anywhere near $50,000 in the next 90 days. The rationale for his forecast was: Dangerous to have opinions that are without fact. New ATHs in Apr-Jun 2024 would be very much in line with past cycles.

42412313,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4Wk0,1681458656,Ether Options Trading Volume Surpasses Bitcoin as Shanghai Upgrade Drives Demand for Bullish Bets,"The options market tied to ether (ETH) has seen more activity than bitcoin (BTC) in the past 24 hours, the first such instance of 2023.  Major exchanges, including industry leader Deribit, have seen ether options contracts worth $1.23 billion exchange hands in the past 24 hours. That is nearly 60% of the global crypto options activity and 50% more than bitcoin's notional trading volume of $823.7 million, according to Swiss-based data tracking website Laevitas.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy while a put option confers the right to sell. Traders use call and put options to hedge their spot/futures market exposure and to acquire an asymmetric payout.  The latest pickup in activity in the ether options market comes on the heels of Ethereum's successful implementation of the highly-anticipated Shanghai upgrade on Wednesday. The upgrade has opened withdrawals of over 18 million ether staked in the network since December 2020, de-risking staking – the process of locking coins in the blockchain to boost network security in return for rewards.  Since then, CoinDesk's ether price index (ETX) has rallied by over 10% to an eight-month high of $2,115, defying fears of a post-upgrade price swoon and outperforming market leader bitcoin. The double-digit gain has revved up investor interest in ether call options.  ""We have seen strong demand for OTM [out-of-the-money] calls in ETH,"" Chris Newhouse, an OTC trader at crypto market maker GSR, wrote in an analysis published on Deribit.  Calls at strike prices above ether's going market rate are called out-of-the-money. Those are cheap compared to calls at strikes below the current spot price.  The increased demand for ether calls is evident from the short-term and long-term options skew, which have flipped positive. The skew measures the spread between the implied volatility premium or prices for calls and puts.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/14/ether-options-trading-volume-surpasses-bitcoin-as-shanghai-upgrade-drives-demand-for-bullish-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30f22341cdaad65c8384497a59c6d1e36c48feb0-1576x1051.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether added over 10% in the past 24 hours, trading at 11-month highs above $2,120 during the Asian trading hours. Thursday’s Shapella upgrade ushered in a major development for the Ethereum network, allowing users to stake and unstake tokens from the network at will – improving the network’s overall outlook.  Governance tokens of the liquid staking protocols saw outsized gains, with Lido’s LDO and Rocket Pool’s RPL surging as much as 14%. Both protocols lock billions of dollars to provide yields on ether staking to users, who can stake any amount of ether to earn rewards while retaining the liquidity of locked coins through derivative tokens and without putting up the required 32 ether to run a validator node.  Lido’s staked ether tokens (STETH) climbed into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization of $12 billion, which is the amount of ether locked on the protocol.  Valerie Tetu, head of strategy at Lido Finance, told CoinDesk that the Shappella upgrade likely led to improved confidence among users.  “Staking withdrawals enabled by the Shanghai upgrade represent a significant milestone in the development of the Ethereum blockchain,” Tetu said over email. “Withdrawals will allow stakers to participate in securing the network with more confidence while increasing the capital efficiency of the tokens they decide to allocate.”  “With regards to the staking ecosystem, the ability for users to withdraw their tokens will support healthy competition across platforms and providers, as well as a broader diversity of staking offerings and architectures to flourish,” she added.  Meanwhile, dogecoin (DOGE) gained for the second straight day. Much of the run came as trading service eToro said it would offer crypto trading directly from the Elon Musk-owned social media giant Twitter, which likely drove speculations of doge being eventually adopted for use as payments on the platform.  Musk is a vocal dogecoin proponent and has expressed support for the Dogecoin network’s development several times in the past.  Elsewhere, ADA surged nearly 9% on the back of fundamental growth in the Cardano network, such as wider support for decentralized application (dapp) development.  Some market observers expect the rally to continue over the next few weeks.  “Many traders had been waiting for the end of the upgrade to start long position accumulation therefore neutral news about the US inflation plus deferred demand pushed ETH price up today,” Ilya Volkov, co-founder of crypto services platform YouHodler, told CoinDesk in an email.  “ETH stays in the same upward trend channel from the beginning of the year. If the macro situation does not get worse, unlikely the current trend will be changed near future despite the fact that selling pressure is going to increase following weeks due to unlocking liquidity,” Volkov added.",POSITIVE,DOGE | ETH | RPL,DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RPL,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/14/ether-dogecoin-lead-crypto-market-bounce-lidos-staked-ether-breaks-into-top-ten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e97a751a652645db0ed4ca7165719b161a61bb5-2464x1386.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The compromised network in this incident was Ethermint, which enables the use of Ethereum smart contracts within the Cosmo ecosystem and is employed by several chains, including Cronos, Kava and Canto.  The bug could have potentially allowed an attacker to bypass specific smart contract functions called handlers, leading to transaction fee theft and denial of service to users.  Immediately upon receiving the report, the Evmos Core Development team and the Cronos team collaborated with Jump Crypto to address the issue. The implementation included a patch to block transactions with ""MsgEthereumTx"" messages, allowing to the elimination of the attack vector.  No malicious exploitation occurred, ensuring the continued stability and reliability of the affected chains.  The Cronos team awarded Jump Crypto a $25,000 bounty for discovering and disclosing the vulnerability.  Evmos said that the root cause of the vulnerability lay in the improper handling of transactional messages in the Ethermint implementation, specifically the interaction between the MsgEthereumTx message and the MsgExec message.  The MsgExec message is used in the Cosmos SDK to allow authorized message execution by allowing one account to grant authorization to another account. However, this feature was not properly secured, allowing the attacker to bypass the ‘EthGasConsumeDecorator,’ which is responsible for deducting gas fees from transactions.  The attacker exploited the vulnerability by embedding a MsgEthereumTx message inside a MsgExec message. This bypassed the EthGasConsumeDecorator, resulting in the attacker not paying gas fees for their transactions.",POSITIVE,없음,ATOM | ETH | TRADING | CRO,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/14/developers-block-potential-eight-figure-exploit-involving-cosmos-based-ethermint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4b2490f30fa58bdb6ed0c1a89ed37ee02479a66-3407x2556.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A poll on the Yearn.finance governance forum shows that members are pretty split about launching the token. The poll is non-binding and is meant to take a temperature check of the community’s interest in moving towards a binding vote via snapshot.  So far, 20 people have cast their vote, with 11 taking the no side.  Yearn.finance is positioning yETH, which holds a basket of LSDs as a way to hedge against the different protocols, which all have their varying smart contract and liquidity risks.  ""yETH essentially spreads the risk across the various Ethereum LSDs while also earning additional yields through Yearn’s large veCRV position for Curve Pools,"" pseudonymous crypto investor DeFi Maestro told CoinDesk earlier in a Twitter message.  In the thread discussing the proposals, some users questioned the need for exposure to multiple LSDs as after the Shanghai upgrade, the risk of de-pegging is low.  “I would much rather see this work like yCRV where you can either stake st-yETH for validator yield, or provide yETH-ETH LP in Curve and receive LP-yETH receipts which earn emissions from treasury directing some its CVX/CRV war chest there for a yield alternative,” one user by the handle MrStiive said.  Others have said that yETH’s proposal is too similar to existing projects like unshETH which has already launched.  “Why do Yearn contributors feel the need to copy their ideas from other projects? As previous replies have pointed out, even part of the proposal itself is copied,” a user named Hardwood said. “DeFi is not governed by copyright; in truth, plagiarism might even be one of the greatest forms of flattery - but in this case, it only exacerbates the problem that the proposal is trying to solve.

Balancer’s OpCo, which manages the protocol’s front end, has laid off two engineers and reduced its operating budget, the providers’ team revealed during the Discord call attended by more than 20 people. The headcount reduction comes as the protocol turns its focus toward improving its user interface and marketing. To that end, the platform’s service provider, Orb Collective, which directs the protocol’s design, marketing and regulatory strategies, will build out a specialized marketing team that can discuss the mechanics of how Balancer works with the platform’s users. The new outreach strategy will also feature a “crypto Twitter-native voice.”  “We developed a new vision for the Balancer brand that we're very excited about, said Jeremy Musighi, CEO of Orb Collective. “Along with that, we have been making some changes to the marketing team personnel to make sure that we have the right people in place to execute this new vision.”  The news comes as the protocol also faces broader market pressure.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization started edging up steadily shortly before U.S. equity markets opened, stalling only after ETH's price had climbed past $2,000 for the first time since August. Ether was recently trading over $2,100, up more than 11% over the past 24 hours, as investors opted for the prospect of additional liquidity while earning staking rewards over the desire to take immediate profits and run.  ""Many traders had been waiting for the end of the upgrade to start long position accumulation,"" Ilya Volkov, CEO and co-founder of crypto trading service provider YouHodler, wrote CoinDesk in an email. ""Therefore, neutral news about U.S. inflation plus deferred demand pushed ETH price up.""  Volkov noted that if current macroeconomic conditions don't worsen, It is unlikely that ether will veer from a price upswing that began with other major cryptos at the start of the year, even if selling pressure increases in subsequent weeks. ""Basically, ETH price stays in the same upward trend channel from the beginning of the year,"" he wrote.  Shapella, also called the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, is the final leg in the Ethereum network’s transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Crypto market observers had been split on its impact, with some predicting a price swing while others anticipated little change.  Bitcoin also continued its more moderately paced momentum, recently edging toward $31,000, up more than 2.5% from Monday at the same time. Other major cryptos spent much of Thursday in the green with ARB, the token of layer 2 companion blockchain Arbitrum, recently soaring about 33% and APT, the native crypto of layer 1 blockchain Aptos, jumping about 12%. The CoinDesk Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently up nearly 5%.  Stocks closed higher with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a large tech component, rising 2% and 1.3%, respectively. A number of crypto-related stocks continued their recent upswing with miners Marathon Digital and Hut 8 Mining each rising about 15%. Recession-fearful Investors also continued to show their appetite for other assets that hold their value, sending gold above $2,050, near its all-time high of $2,069, set in 2020.  Will ether continue to rise? CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams suggested that ETH deposits would offer some signals about its path forward. Since January 2021 ""the trajectory of ether deposited into ETH staking contracts has steadily risen, a direction that suggests the asset is gaining, not losing, favor,"" Williams wrote. ""Over the coming weeks and months, this metric will likely flatten as investors who must un-stake ETH begin the process of doing so. But for those who want to stake, Shapella’s completion signals reduced risk, increased liquidity and brought an uptick in asset value.""

Insights  Why Didn’t You Sell the News of Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade?  Going by the numbers, it seems like many ether (ETH) stakers have decided to hold onto their coins. Although several analysts predicted the just-completed Ethereum Shanghai hard fork (along with the separate Capella upgrade, together known as “Shapella”) would be a “sell-the-news” moment, ETH has actually climbed to eight-month highs. The second-largest crypto by market capitalization was trading above $2,000 for the first time since last summer, after gaining ~3% during trading hours in Asia.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  What this says about the viability of Ethereum and the outlook for the price of ETH is an open question. Shanghai, the backward-compatible hard fork, unlocked the ability for Ethereum stakers to withdraw tokens they pledged to the Ethereum deposit contract used to validate the proof-of-stake network, as well as the token payments they received for doing so. Many stakers initially pledged 32 ETH to become validators in 2020, and haven’t really had access to their coins since.  So the 18 million-plus ETH currently staked (worth about $33 billion) has not led to a torrent of sales. Loyal CoinDesk readers likely knew the “selling pressure” on ETH was overstated. As Amphibian Capital CEO James Hodges wrote on Monday, the vast majority of ETH validators were in the red leading up to the event, making it unlikely they’d cash out at a loss. Now that crypto prices are rising, led in particular by bitcoin, which broke the important $30,000 threshold this week, fortunes may reverse.  Read the full story here.

The organization, which calls itself ""the first NFT DAO on Solana,"" was formed by enthusiasts of SMB, one of Solana's earliest NFT collections. To join MonkeDAO, you must own an SMB NFT.  SMB launched ""Gen1"" of its collection in June 2021 and then released ""Gen2"" in August 2021, with the collection of 5,000 pixelated monkeys gaining widespread appeal. At the time of writing SMB has a floor price of 223 SOL (about $5,427) and has done over $1.8 million SOL (about $43 million) in total sales volume.  In February, decentralized Solana trading protocol Hadeswap acquired SMB from its original founders and transferred its ownership to HadesDAO, promising to respect the project's legacy. On Thursday, HadesDAO passed a proposal that would allow MonkeDAO to purchase the SMB intellectual property (IP) including ""all rights, assets, accounts and keys from HadesDAO"" for $2 million USDC. According to the proposal, this includes any legal registrations for the brand, SMB website code, ownership over the SMB Twitter and Discord channels and more.  ""MonkeDAO believes the SMB project and all holders of the SMB Gen2 NFTs will benefit from this acquisition and that HadesDAO will benefit more from money in its treasury rather than maintaining ownership of the SMB project,"" the proposal says.  The announcement was received generally favorably on Twitter, with some calling the purchase ""historic.""  Ariel Givner, MonkeDAO's legal counsel, told CoinDesk that SOLBigBrain, an active MonkeDAO community member, gave the organization a $1 million USDC loan at 0% interest to facilitate the acquisition. She added that MonkeDAO will soon launch its own NFT collection titled The Monkes in order to supplement funding.

42412307,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4WgG,1681434000,Asia-Based Digital Asset Firm HashKey Group Introduces Wealth Management Service,"Digital asset financial services firm HashKey Group is looking to expand its appeal to professional and accredited investors through its new wealth management arm, Hashkey Wealth.  The wealth management service will also target institutions and family offices, aiming to tap into the ""significant demand"" from such investors for digital assets, the firm announced on Friday.  HashKey cited a 2022 study by Boston Consulting Group which suggested that less than 1% of individual wealth is invested in cryptocurrency, compared to around 25% in equity. This suggests there may be substantial room for growth for crypto exposure.  To further enhance its offering for professional investors, HashKey has expanded its over-the-counter (OTC) service by boosting its liquidity coverage and range of tokens in the spot market.
