42397707,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrQM,1402698644,"All Things Alt: StartCOIN's Crowdfunding Twist, World Cup Fever and Vertcoin's Stealth Move","Any superstitious altcoin enthusiasts out there? Today marks the coincidence of both Friday the 13th and the full moon, an appropriate way to end yet another week in the digital currency world.  But, there’s no need to dwell on the existence of luck as it relates to cryptographic payment systems. Instead, let’s kick back and take a look at some of the more notable recent happenings in altcoin for a few minutes – and hope that you don’t see any black cats walking under ladders or breaking a nearby mirror before you post your next buy or sell order.  Altcoins rise to cheer on World Cup festivities  The 2014 Fifa World Cup kicked off this week, pitting the world’s football (or soccer for US fans) champions against one another in Brazil.  To commemorate the event, several new altcoins have launched with competing algorithms and market outlooks but with decidedly identical branding.  Worldcupcoin  is an X11 proof-of-work coin that seeks primarily to promote the games and serve as a vehicle for holders to gamble on the matches throughout the World Cup.  This altcoin sports a roughly 3 million coin max supply limit, though according to the coin’s Bitcoin Talk forum post, the project is light on offered services and information.  FIFAWCCoin  is a similar project but the developers opted to use the X13 mining algorithm. Additionally, there will only be roughly 600,000 coins in circulation, making it rarer than its similarly-named cousin.  Long-term, the altcoin’s backers hope to promote sports programs worldwide, but questions remain regarding how the project would weather possible trademark violations arising from its name.  Additionally, established altcoin communities are getting in on the action.  The worldcoin development team is hosting a betting bracket for the games. According to Bitcoin Talk, 25% of entry fees will go to a charity that has yet to be chosen by the worldcoin community.  Other coin communities, including those for blackcoin, NXT and the aptly-named soccercoin, are holding betting rounds and other activities to mark the games in Brazil.  StartCOIN seeks to reshape crypto crowdfunding  Crowdfunding and digital currencies have long gone hand in hand, ranging from centralized platforms like Pozible to decentralized crowdfunding solutions.  On the grassroots level, plenty of projects have gained backing on Bitcoin Talk and other platforms through initial public offerings that take bitcoin or other alternative currencies. As well, some coin projects have been pitched as crowdfunding vehicles for charities.  StartCOIN  is a new project backed by financial journalist and maxcoin founder Max Keiser and equity crowdfunding firm BankToTheFuture.com that is looking to shake up the digital currency crowdfunding landscape. The initiative pairs an altcoin with StartJOIN, a platform that aims to create a fun, inclusive environment for digital currency enthusiasts who want to support worthy causes.  The altcoin is fully mineable, based on the scrypt mining algorithm. As well, an airdrop is planned to distribute 25 startcoins to every member of the StartJOIN community.  BankToTheFuture.com CEO Simon Dixon explained that StartCOIN aims to create decentralized funding community that works together to provide money to artists and developers, saying:  ""I see a coin for crowdfunding like quantitative easing for the people, by the people and without the central banks. People are creating money, money is used for investing in businesses and pushing forward projects, and there is no debt involved.”  Keiser told CoinDesk that, ultimately, the project could fundamentally shift how people use digital currencies as a technology:  “I think that within a few months StartJOIN, by successfully combining [crowdfunding] and crypto - as well as implementing the new features we have coming - will be on our way in completely changing the way people think about what's possible in this space.""  Vertcoin rejects anonymity  In recent weeks, we’ve seen a steady stream of developments that bring greater anonymity to digital currency transactions. Notable entries including darkcoin and XC stirred up passionate reactions in the community for their approaches to transaction masking.  The vertcoin community is moving to integrate its own privacy-oriented infrastructure with a new ""stealth address"" feature. First announced in late May, the project is not an effort to anonymize vertcoin transactions, but instead a way to offer privacy controls as a choice that some consumers may opt to make.  Notably, the developers intimated in a blog post from 30th May that such a direction did not fit within the long-term goals of vertcoin, saying:  ""We are of the opinion that mainstream adoption won’t come from [anonymity] features, and that they will actually damage the currencies that go down that route. The fact is, people don’t care about anonymity – if they did, they wouldn’t use social media.""  On 10th June, the vertcoin team announced on the altcoin’s official subreddit that the project had reached the alpha stage, with an estimated month-long testing phase to commence before a private-invite beta was launched. Monocle, an alt that is merge-mined with vertcoin, is being leveraged to playtest and debug the feature before it is integrated with vertcoin.  To maintain transparency, the vertcoin dev team is sharing discovered bugs and has made a point to invite any and all feedback from the community.  Strange alt of the week  The altcoin world is no stranger to meme-themed coins. After all, dogecoin, based on the beloved shiba inu of internet fame, has arguably set the bar for how all other so-called memecoins shoot for success.  A new coin is set to debut this weekend that taps a popular, if not highly unusual, internet joke. Watcoin is based on an image of an old woman that has since found fame as a means to express confusion or surprise online. According to KnowYourMeme.com, the word is ""the only proper response to something that makes absolutely no sense"".  Watcoin aims to tap into the popularity of this phrase, boasting the slogan ""in WAT we trust"". The altcoin utilizes the X11 mining algorithm, and also incorporate Kimono’s Gravity Well to enable per-block difficulty retargeting.  Notably, the developers premined 1% of the coin’s expected 200 billion WAT max supply, with the idea of saving an undisclosed amount to donate to the old woman embossed on the coin’s insignia.  The developers wrote on the coin’s official website:  ""We also kept a portion of the premine for the Wat Lady whose likeness we have used. Once she can be identified we will attempt to set up a wallet for her or her legal guardian. It is our way for her to receive some payback.""

42397703,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrNP,1402695026,"Blockchain Launches Bitcoin.com, Previews Unreleased Android App","Bitcoin wallet and block explorer provider Blockchain has officially launched its Bitcoin.com website today, giving visitors a learning portal to the basics of the digital currency.  Previously, the site was used by fellow consumer wallet provider Coinbase as a customer onboarding tool. However, Blockchain announced its 5-year deal to manage the domain name earlier this year.  At the time, the company expressed its hope ""to help drive consumer adoption and education"" using the web portal, stating:  ""We’re excited to create new learning experiences and introduce millions of new users to bitcoin as a result of this exclusive deal.""  The site is available in at least 70 languages, including Czech, Persian and Zulu, among others.  Blockchain for Android  The announcement coincided with the news that Blockchain will launch a more consumer-friendly wallet app update on Android devices next month, as reported by Business Insider.  Blockchain executives told the media outlet that the app will emphasize security as well, and provided screenshots highlighting the app's improved interface.      The company has also announced that it will further resubmit its app to the iOS store following Apple's most recent policy update, which may now allow for bitcoin apps with money transfer capabilities to be listed via the platform.    Onramp for beginners    In addition to its app updates, Blockchain has been busy laying the groundwork for what it appears to be its attempt to encourage more novice users into the bitcoin ecosystem using the Bitcoin.com domain.  Last week, Blockchain announced a partnership with GogoCoin to issue 2 mBTC preloaded plastic cards, as part of a marketing effort inviting new users to redeem their mBTC via Blockchain wallets on Bitcoin.com.  Site overview  At Bitcoin.com, users are greeted by an introductory ""What is bitcoin?"" video, with the current bitcoin price displayed in the top corner.

42425772,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg5Hh,1402693820,BitFury Pulls 1PH/s of Mining Power from Ghash.io Amid Community Uproar,"Following the news that Ghash.io was nearing control of 51% of the bitcoin network's hashrate, industrial bitcoin mining facility operator BitFury has released a new statement saying that it has moved 1.5 petahash of its hasing power out of the major bitcoin mining pool.  The company, which operates two large-scale mining facilities in Finland and Iceland and recently raised $20m, further indicated it will move additional petahashes out of Ghash.io over the next 72 hours.  Marc Aafjes, BitFury’s chief strategy and communications officer, suggested that the company felt compelled to take action due to the widespread community concern, stating:  ""The high level of combined hash power in the Ghash pool is concerning to many participants in the system. As a leader and trusted partner in the bitcoin system, BitFury has decided to transfer some of its hashing power away from Ghash to help reduce these concerns.""  Should Ghash.io's share of total bitcoin mining power continue to increase, Aafjes indicated that BitFury may be willing to take additional steps to reduce the influence of the pool, adding:  ""We will continue to monitor this situation and if the pool comes too close again to 51% we will move more of our capacity.""  At press time, Ghash.io accounted for roughly 48% of the bitcoin network's total hashing power, according to figures from Blockchain.info. The second most powerful pool, Discus Fish, holds 11% of the network.  The threat of a 51% attack  Due to the difficulty of a given miner discovering a block, many bitcoin miners join pools, which consolidate mining power and increase miners' chances of discovering a block and receiving proportional shares of a given reward.  As pools constitute a majority of the network's hashing power, there has been growing concern in the community regarding the outsized influence of Ghash.io.  Though some notable bitcoin community members suggest the threat is not as grave as widely believed, a mining pool with more than 51% of the network's hashing power could theoretically double-spend transactions, prevent confirmations and keep competing miners from discovering new blocks.  Such a threat is not unique to bitcoin, as earlier this year litecoin mining pool Coinotron grew toward 51% of the network's hashing total before individual miners in the pool withdrew from the cooperative.  Community reaction  The varied responses to Ghash.io's growing influence in the mining network were perhaps most visible on reddit, where bitcoin miners and enthusiasts partook in an impassioned discussion throughout the day.  Some reddit users took to the social network to suggest potential peer-to-peer solutions to the growing influence of centralized mining pools, while speculating on how other mining pools were able to avoid exerting such an influence on the network successfully in the past.  Still, other miners defended Ghash.io and mining pools, arguing that they are a necessary part of the ecosystem that enables independent miners to profit from bitcoin.

42425753,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg4rh,1402684276,European Bank to Study Benefits of Integrating Bitcoin Technology,"Estonia-based bank LHV has announced a new project that will explore the legal framework and potential uses of bitcoin's block chain technology in banking so it might develop bank services for bitcoin and other digital currencies.  ""We are interested in the technological side of digital currencies as we hope it could make bank services more simple and efficient,"" Priit Rum, head of communications at LHV, told CoinDesk.  The project manager will examine all digital currencies, not limiting itself to bitcoin.  For now, the bank won't engage in trading bitcoin, Rum said, but more likely, could develop its payments system using block chain technology.  The company claims to be the first bank in the world to implement such a program, stating:  ""We have been aware of crypto currencies for some time now […] we decided last month that establishing a side project to explore the block chain technology and analyse possibilities of cryptocurrencies would be a good opportunity to stay with the innovation.""  Regulatory uncertainty remains  While the news of this action by a major bank is perhaps encouraging, in Estonia, bitcoin is tangled in regulatory uncertainty.  Earlier this year, the country’s central bank issued a warning against bitcoin and digital currencies calling it a Ponzi scheme, saying ""virtual currency schemes are an innovation that [deserve] some caution"", but that it would continue to monitor their development.  Shortly after, local bitcoin trading site BTC.ee put a halt on trades, coming under pressure from Estonian authorities who challenged the site’s compliance with the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act.  Said Rum:  ""LHV is a regulated bank and we take all the regulations and guidelines very seriously […] For us, all the questions about 'know your customer' and concerns of money laundering have to be dealt with before we can really develop new bank services using new technology.""  Local enthusiasm grows  Estonians have been enthusiastic about bitcoin for some time, despite the regulatory difficulties the domestic ecosystem faces.  The country’s capital Talinn had a successful week-long bitcoin showcase last month, during which bitcoin advocates came together to educate those new to the digital currency and boost its popularity.

42395320,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLWY,1402680037,Bitcoin Donation Cup Brings Out the Best in Business Community,"A global bitcoin donation drive is gaining steam just as the 2014 FIFA World Cup gets underway. To date, 10 companies from across the world’s regional bitcoin economies have pledged their support to the 2014 Bitcoin Donation Cup.  Companies from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and the US have joined forces to sponsor the event, including BitPay, BitGive, Xapo, Mercado Bitcoin and Unisend, plus MexBT, ALTIS and Bitso.  Also participating are local support groups like the Colombia Bitcoin Foundation and the Fundacion Bitcoin de Argentina.  The Bitcoin Donation Cup enables fundraisers to generate donations by bringing scannable QR codes to locations where the World Cup is being viewed.  Sharing it round  Seventy percent of donations will be sent to a participating charity while the remaining 30% will be used to support the fans who are collecting donations by helping them pay for food, lodging and travel expenses.  Thanks to bitcoin's open nature, donors are also able to track their donations in real time for the duration of the event. Information on how to register and participate is available on the program's Facebook page as well as its own home page.  Alberto Vega, BitPay’s Regional Manager for Latin America, said:  “This is a great opportunity for BitPay to support many important charities throughout the world while introducing bitcoin to fans throughout South America.”  Charities are chosen by participants in the donation drive, with BitPay processing the donations and approving the charities that get involved. As well, the BitGive Foundation is also raising funds to use for its charitable causes.  Connie Gallippi, founder and Executive Director of BitGive, remarked in a statement that the project is bringing out the best of the bitcoin community, saying:  “It's amazing to see bitcoin users around the world support not only our cause but many other charities.”  Grassroots donation drive  The Bitcoin Donation Cup demonstrates how community-level fundraising is possible through the use of bitcoin. QR codes enable fast transactions between donors and receivers, and as the images in this article demonstrate, participants are relying on creative flair to drum up support.  Most notably, the donation drive’s self-styled mascot 'Mr Bitcoin' can be seen (above) interacting with passersby and football fans in Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro.  Other passionate fans have also adopted flashy means of attracting crowds and, hopefully, raising some bitcoin for a good cause.  In addition to the donation drive, the Cup is a good means of spreading the word about digital currencies to consumers who are gathering around the world to watch the games in Brazil.  How you can get involved  The Bitcoin Donation Cup offers participation in three different ways.  Firstly, football fans can make their own posters and raise bitcoin, with special prizes (ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 BTC) being offered for those who can gain significant amounts of attention on both national TV and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. A real-time donation tracker on the Cup’s official website should make it all the more fun, too.  Secondly, community members can opt to simply donate to a charitable cause.  Lastly, those interested can take part in World Cup-related bitcoin celebrations happening at a number of bars in countries across the Americas. Those who happen to be in Brazil have the added bonus of being able to meet Mr Bitcoin himself.

42395329,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLhN,1402672130,Search Engine DuckDuckGo Now Lets Users Check Bitcoin Balances,"DuckDuckGo, the search engine for privacy lovers, has implemented a new feature that allows bitcoiners to check their balances simply by dropping their public address in the search box.  While finding your latest balance can be done via your wallet or block chain explorer services such as Blockchain, DuckDuckGo, which requires no login, can make the process far quicker and simpler.  📷  For users that make DuckDuckGo the default search engine in their browser, checking a balance is as simple as pasting the address into the search box and hitting the 'return' key.  One further, and possibly useful feature, is that the search engine will also pull up a list of websites featuring the bitcoin key in question.  Privacy concerns  Since the revelations of extensive surveillance of web search histories by the NSA Prism data mining programme, as revealed by Edward Snowden in May 2013, along with increasing awareness of user tracking and biasing of results by search engines such as Google, public concerns over online privacy have skyrocketed.  Even for people who normally have no serious concerns about privacy, seeing ads turn up for items they typed into a search box days or weeks ago can be plain creepy.  DuckDuckGo – which goes by the slogan, ""The search engine that does not track you"" – has capitalised greatly over such fears, taking the bold move of refusing to log either users' searches or their IP addresses, meaning your search history is only saved locally in your browser and no one can see who is making the search.  Furthermore, popular search engines often track searches and tailor later results based user profiling in order to target their ads. This means two people will often get different search results from identical search terms.  DuckDuckGo, however, refuses to engage in creating these 'filter bubbles’ and aims to provide the same results for every user. The site also attempts to provide better quality search results, removing 'clutter' such as posts from social networks.  Rapid growth  Since 2010, the site's traffic has been growing steadily and, with over 1 billion search queries made last year, has become one of the few search engine's to be knocking a growing dent in Google's vast visitor numbers.  The company profited early on from a clever ad campaign in which it place billboards in San Francisco challenging Google on privacy (B) and saw visitor numbers increase markedly.  The privacy features of the site have been much more significant, though, with DuckDuckGo’s user traffic peaking sharply at Google's announcement that it was storing user histories (G) and Edward Snowden's later NSA revelations (I).  Apple's recent announcement that DuckDuckGo can be selected to replace Google as the default search engine in OS X and iOS 8 surely won't do its growth curve any harm, either.  About the company  DuckDuckGo, which is named after the playground game 'Duck, Duck, Goose', was founded by Gabriel Weinberg in February 2008 in Pennsylvania, USA.  Weinberg bootstrapped the project using his own funds until October 2011, when Union Square Ventures and other angel investors provided the company's first investment of $3m, according to CrunchBase. This funding has enabled the team to expand to around 20 employees.  DuckDuckGo generates funds via low-key advertising and affiliate revenue, while not allowing these to affect its privacy policy.  The company spells it out on its website, saying:  ""It is a myth that search engines needs to track you to make money on web search. When you type in a search, we can show an ad just based on that search term. For example, if you type in, 'car' we show a car ad.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/13/search-engine-duckduckgo-now-lets-users-check-bitcoin-balances,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e38221bc2d2f5e48a9fb3bde78432c4e47578ce3-2560x1714.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425763,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg55h,1402664303,The King's College New York is Now Accepting Bitcoin for Tuition Payments,"The King’s College, a private Christian liberal arts college located in New York City’s financial district, is now accepting bitcoin for tuition and other expenses through a partnership with merchant processor Coin.co.  The announcement by The King's Collegehttps://www.tkc.edu/about-kings marks the latest major university to accept bitcoin following decisions from the University of Nicosia in Cyprus and more recently the UK's University of Cumbria.  Although California-based online and residential school Draper University announced its decision to accept bitcoin in 2013, the move by The King's College into the bitcoin ecosystem is notable due to the fact that it is a more storied private institution, having been founded in 1938.  Despite coming from the more traditional educational system, Dr Gregory Thornburyhttps://www.tkc.edu/biography-president, President of The King’s College, told CoinDesk that the decision to accept bitcoin is one that is very much in line with his school's core values:  ""We have a strong emphasis on the founding documents of the US, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which are very individual based. Bitcoin represents that, it's the empowerment of individuals.""  Further, Thornbury suggests that the move is one other universities would be wise to consider, given the current problems facing the higher education system in the US, saying:  ""Adopting or taking seriously disruptive technologies in the delivery of the educational program is something that everyone needs to be studying, and I think [bitcoin] is one aspect of that.""  The King's College campus is located at 56 Broadway, New York, in close proximity to the epicenter of traditional finance, Wall Street.  Powerful technology  Thornbury further discussed The King's College curriculum, drawing comparisons between bitcoin and the teachings it could help impart on its roughly 600 students.  The school president explained:  ""We have an Oxford University-style politics, philosophy and economics core, with a strong emphasis on business and finance. We're always very interested in developing advent technologies in business and finance, and certainly bitcoin would be one of those.""  Additionally, Thornbury stressed that, while not an avid user of bitcoin, he sees the technology as a powerful one, likening the transformations it could bring to the financial system to the advent of email in the 1990s.  He added: ""I think any college president would be wise to get in on that.""  Bitcoin education  The move is also a significant announcement for New York-based processor Coin.co, whose board of directors includes Matthew Mellon, the former chairman of New York's Republican Party Finance committee and whose family founded Carnegie Mellon and Tufts University.  Mellon told CoinDesk that his company, led by CEO Brendan Diaz, believes that the bitcoin ecosystem would be wise to focus on spreading bitcoin awareness, stating:  ""It's becoming more and more important and relevant to the financial sector, as a lot of universities are cooperating with companies on Wall Street.""  The sentiment seems to be shared by others in the bitcoin community. Most recently, MIT Bitcoin Club announced it would distribute $500,000 in bitcoin to MIT students this fall, while California-based merchant processor Coinbase unveiled plans in May to provide $10 in free BTC to university students who enrolled in its consumer wallet offering.

42425760,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIg51h,1402662216,Why The SEC Delay Over Crowdfunding Rules is Stifling Bitcoin Innovation,"Brian Klein is a partner at the Los Angeles-based litigation boutique Baker Marquart LLP, the chair of the Bitcoin Foundation’s legal advocacy committee (although he is not writing here on behalf of the foundation), and a former US federal prosecutor. This article was co-authored alongside Molly White, a partner at McGuireWoods LLP in Los Angeles and a former SEC enforcement attorney.  Crowdfunding has undoubtedly become an important way for emerging and innovative companies to raise money. Look no further than Soylent (the high-profile and controversial food replacement product), which raised millions through crowdfunding.  Not surprisingly, entrepreneurs are developing bitcoin-powered companies and applications that could revolutionize both the crowdfunding field and the cryptocurrency space.  With the assistance of the bitcoin protocol, a company that wants to crowdfund can potentially avoid using current and perhaps more costly third-parties like Kickstarter and Indiegogo.  Examples of bitcoin crowdfunding platforms that are in development include Mike Hearn’s Lighthouse app and Joel Dietz’s Swarm (which describes itself as 'the Facebook of crowdfunding').  Unfortunately, crowdfunding’s (and thus bitcoin’s) ability to reach its full potential is stalled, for the time being. This is because the SEC has not yet issued rules that would allow crowdfunding as a way to sell equities in a company (ie: stock).  The background  In April 2012, Congress enacted the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (or JOBS Act), legislation meant to make it easier for small businesses to raise money. One way that Congress sought to do that was to allow companies to use crowdfunding to raise up to $1 million in a 12-month period.  However, because Congress believed crowdfunding could increase the possibility of investment fraud, it put in place some significant limitations. Those measures include limiting the amount of money that an investor can invest – up to $2,000 or 5% of the investor’s annual income (whichever is greater) – as well as requiring companies to crowdfund through an intermediary and to make certain disclosures to potential investors.  Congress also directed the SEC to issue rules to implement fraud protection.  Crowdfunding through an intermediary means working with either a registered broker-dealer or a funding portal registered with the SEC. For a crowdfunding website to qualify as a funding portal and sell equities, that website will have to be a member of FINRA, be registered with the SEC, and be subject to SEC examinations. As for the disclosure requirements, they will be substantial.  In October 2013, the SEC proposed rules to govern the offer and sale of securities through crowdfunding. If those rules are enacted (as is expected), a company will have to disclose:  The identity and business experience of its directors, officers, and anyone who holds more than 20% of the company’s shares  The nature of the business  The risk factors in making the investment  Any related-party transactions between the company and directors, officers, or family members  Information about any other exempt offerings in past three years  How it will use the funds that it raises  Financial information about the company  The amount and the terms of outstanding debt  Information about the number, type and price of securities offered  The target amount the company would like to raise and the deadline for reaching the target  Adverse consequences  It is now June 2014. When Congress enacted the JOBS Act in April 2012, it gave the SEC 270 days – until January 2013 – to adopt its rules. With that date now long past, and with the passage of eight months since the SEC proposal, one can only hope that the rules will be finalized by the end of this summer.  In the meantime, offering securities in a crowdfunding campaign, regardless of the country of origin, may and likely does violate SEC regulations, among other potential problems. Failing to wait for the SEC to finish its rule making risks an SEC investigation and significant adverse consequences, potentially even criminal consequences.  The SEC needs to enact the crowdfunding rules as soon as possible. Doing so will help everyone, including bitcoin enterprises that are developing crowdfunding applications, or that are hoping to tap into crowdfunding for raising money. Innovation should not have to wait any longer.

Data from Blockchain.info indicates that Ghash.io’s hashrate has been fluctuating between 40% and 50% of the network's total over the course of the week.  Jeffrey Smith, CIO of CEX.IO tweeted on 11th June that the company was planning to release an official statement. He also reassured bitcoiners that he was aware of the situation at hand and did not intend to harm the community.    I want everyone to know - we are aware of the 51% on @ghash_io We would never harm the community. Our official statement is coming soon.      — Jeffrey Smith (@jeff_smith01) June 11, 2014    While Smith may understand the repercussions of his pool approaching the 51% mark, the exchange has not released a plan of action to mitigate the threat.  However in correspondence with CoinDesk, Smith said they were still working on a strategy.    @roopgill Hi! We are working on the solution as well as the statement. As soon as it is released - you'll be the first one to know.      — Jeffrey Smith (@jeff_smith01) June 13, 2014    In a similar episode from January 2014 where its total hashing power hit 42%, Ghash.io released an statement outlining its plans to reduce its network share.  According to the press release, the exchange temporarily stopped accepting new independent mining facilities to their pool. They also said they were implementing a feature allowed CEX.IO users to mine bitcoin from other pools.  Many bitcoin miners around the world also started leaving the Ghash.io bitcoin pool following this news. Within a day Ghash.io’s mining power dropped from 42% to 38%, according to Blockchain.info.  A numbers game  Theoretically, a 51% attack would occur if one entity managed to gain control of more than 50% of the network’s computer power. Such an attack could allow the attacker to reverse transactions they have sent, make double-spend transactions, prevent confirmations or even prevent other miners from mining valid blocks. It would corrupt the block chain and render the entire system unsafe.  However, this is speculative and has not been done before.  In January, Blockchain’s chief security officer Andreas M. Antonopoulos explained at a bitcoin meetup in Los Angeles why he is not worried about a 51% attack.  “To me the 51% is a very interesting academic or theoretical experiment but it has very few practical implications for the actual bitcoin network. And the reason for that is because the effort to execute a 51% attack is far, far greater than the actual benefit of doing it.”  Ghash.io's Popularity  Ghash.io  is owned by CEX.IO, a London-registered bitcoin exchange which was one of the first cloudhashing services to gain popularity.  Ghash.io has been around for over a year and gained popularity among miners for its 0% fee structure. Miners can also buy mining contracts from CEX.IO. These features have made the pool extremely popular, contributing to its potential 51% hashing power.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | SPONSORED,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/13/cexio-slow-to-respond-as-fears-of-51-attack-spread,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/716a759ea77d2b54f64a1ebace73b30f065d580c-1001x762.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42395318,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLUa,1402626937,"Bitcoin Price Falls Below $600 as US Government Prepares for 30,000 BTC Selloff","The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk US Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) declined on 12th June to a low of $568.87 after reaching a high of $634.38. The dramatic price swing, however, was followed by a slight recovery to $582.29 at press time.  The price decline began at 13:00 (UTC) before accelerating sharply at 19:00, dropping from $616 to the day's low. However, by 22:30, USD bitcoin prices rallied to $592.77 before declining again to press time levels.  The decline coincided with the US Marshall Service's announcement it will be initiating an auction of 30,000 BTC confiscated from the infamous online black market Silk Road. The sale is expected to be held on 27th June from 06:00 to 18:00 (EST).  Though volatile prices are a common occurrence with bitcoin, the recent slump can likely be attributed to varying sentiment for what the government's bitcoin auction may mean for the bitcoin economy, as evidenced by community posts on reddit.  Silk Road auction  An auction-style sale of a massive amount of bitcoin, to be sold mostly in nine blocks of 3,000 BTC, could be problematic for the price in the short term, depending on sentiment.  For the cryptocurrency industry, this situation is unprecedented, despite similar reactions to past announcements regarding the potential sale of seized Silk Road bitcoins.  Individual investors may watch the situation closely, and make decisions whether to buy or sell BTC based on the finalized auction winners. These investors, who must commit $200,000 to participate in the auction, are expected to wire US dollars to the government on 1st July.  The published prices of the eventual sales could have anaffect on overall prices. This is suggested by the historically strong reactions to news surrounding the Silk Road case, though this will remain to be seen.  Positive sentiment  Bitcoin has seen a relative run-up in price recently, bolstered by promising consumer adoption stories and strong community showings at major conferences.  In late May, bitcoin broke the $600 barrier, which had not been surpassed since March, when negative news regarding regulation in China drove prices below the $500 mark.  The recent increase comes at a time when many large public companies, such as DISH Network and Expedia, are announcing acceptance of bitcoin as a form of payment.  It remains to be seen whether this latest news will mark a reversal in this trend.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/13/bitcoin-price-falls-below-600-as-us-government-prepares-for-30000-btc-selloff,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acb93c84aba3f10848234a06e991e1530f46d0a6-977x613.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
