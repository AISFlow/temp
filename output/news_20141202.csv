The funds will be used by the digibyte developers as part of a push to upgrade the core functionality of the project's code and develop new services on top of its infrastructure. The announcement coincides with the launch of two digibyte-focused startups: DigiPay LLC in California and DigiTrade International Limited Hong Kong.  Digibyte's developers said the Tofugear partnership will provide additional logistical and operational support as the group expands what they call the Digibyte Ecosystem. Central to this goal, the team wrote, is providing payment mechanisms that shift away from legacy solutions and move toward modern, more secure tools like mobile devices.  In its announcement to its community, the digibyte developers said that they plan to build on previous experiments using digital currency, explaining:  ""In collaboration with Tofugear Limited’s strategic retail, wholesale and technical development partnerships, the digibyte core protocol is currently being developed into a range of solutions that will revolutionize the consumer’s daily life.""  Digibyte founder and DigiPay president Jared Tate told CoinDesk that through the partnership with Tofugear, the digibyte team now has greater freedom to push next-generation services while still building on the project’s central planks.  The $250,000 raised represents one of the most high-profile altcoin funding announcements to date. Several altcoin projects have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars during initial coin offerings, and last month, micropayments startup Dogetipbot raised nearly $500,000 in new capital.  Expanding efforts  Digibyte, an altcoin founded earlier this year that enables multi-algorithm mining, is hoping to position itself as a next-generation payment mechanism as well as a currency that can catch on with global users.  In its letter, the development team outlined both its past achievements and future ambitions, which includes utilizing digibyte as a means of social expression.  The letter explained:  ""Through social media platforms that range from keeping in contact with your friends, writing on topics that are important to you, messaging the world and letting them know your opinions, or simply watching streaming videos online, digital currency will prove to be a means of letting people know what you think, in a way that users can bank on.""  Through DigiPay, the startup venture focused on building out the digibyte ecosystem, the developers hope to push their solutions to a wider business audience.  Tofugear pledges long-term support  A Hong Kong-based web developer, Tofugear brings experience building retail-focused platforms and solutions to the digibyte team's payments work. According to Tofugear’s website, the company, founded in 2010, works primarily on retail and product-oriented projects.  The team noted in a statement that the partnership will be a long-term one, explaining:  ""As an ongoing collaboration, Tofugear and the digibyte team are excited by the prospect of working towards their mutual goal of engaging people with technology that enriches their everyday lives.""  Tofugear added that by combining their efforts, it hopes to produce new solutions using the technology underlying decentralized digital currency.  ""At the edge of the digital currency frontier, the digibyte and Tofugear team synergies offer real opportunities where digital currency is primed for entrance,"" the Hong Kong-based company said.

42377876,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rLX,1417539023,Citi: Ross Ulbricht Bitcoins Likely to Sell For Discount at USMS Auction,"The US Marshals Service (USMS) is set to auction off 50,000 BTC seized from alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht this Thursday, and if a new research note from financial giant Citi proves accurate, participants may be able to obtain bitcoins at a steep discount.  Penned by Citi's global head of FX strategy Steven Englander, the internal note argues that bitcoin's recent decline in value against the dollar will cause participants to ""lowball their bids relative to the current market price"".  Englander asserted that the prospect of future bitcoin auctions is likely to influence bidder behavior, as the USMS has indicated it will soon seek to sell off the roughly 94,000 BTC still in its possession in the coming months.  Englander writes:  ""Bidding above the market price does not seem like a strong strategy given that there are 90,000 more to be auctioned off and there has been plenty of opportunity to buy bitcoin on the cheap in recent months.""  The first USMS auction, held this June, ultimately saw roughly 30,000 BTC confiscated from the black market website Silk Road sold to Draper Fisher Jurvetson partner Tim Draper.  Englander suggested that rumors that Draper bid above market price, before bitcoin's decline in value from roughly $640 at the time of sale to $381, would also influence buyer behavior.  A Black Friday deal  In addition to these factors, Englander stated his belief that few buyers in any USMS auction bid above market price.  Englander went as far as to suggest that this would not be a wise investment strategy for participants, writing that he doesn't see an advantage ""given bitcoin's fungibility and the excess supply that has driven down the price over the last year"".  ""My expectation is that most bids will be aggressively to the downside in the hope of getting a post-Black Friday bargain,"" Englander said. ""Bids for a block or two may be at a moderate discount to the market price, but I would expect the bid for the biggest number of blocks to be at a hefty discount.""  Still, Englander said this outcome is likely to be influenced by whether participants desire to buy and hold the currency, a strategy evoked by Draper, or simply buy to sell the bitcoins on the open market.  Auction process a deterrent  Englander went on to state that, even in spite of the opportunity to obtain bitcoins at a discount, the requirements of the US Marshals auction itself may turn buyers away.  For example, Englander indicated that investors who don't want to meet the auction's know-your-customer (KYC) requirements or put up the $100,000–$150,000 necessary to participate may be dissuaded from participation.  As a result of these factors, Englander concluded:  ""There seems little reason to go through the USMS rather than just buy outright and the illiquidity of large blocks means that there is significant price risk for anyone who may be in position of turning over their blocks anytime soon.""  The responses echo beliefs voiced by prospective bidders as well, some of whom have stated their belief that overall interest in the second auction is not as strong as the first.

42377880,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rT5,1417536207,Bitcoin Foundation Issues Fraud Alert Over Cloned Websites,"The Bitcoin Foundation has issued a fraud alert over fake websites that are attempting to steal innocent visitors' bitcoin.  The bitcoin advocacy organisation said in a statementhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/12/warning-fraud-alert/ that it knows of two cloned websites, bitcoincompensation.com and bitsecuretransfer.com, which are cloning the legitimate Bitcoin Foundation site and spoofing web addresses and domains.  ""Neither of these domains have anything to do with the Bitcoin Foundation,"" the foundation stressed.  How the scam works  Bitcoiners are directed to a fake page that looks like the legitimate Bitcoin Foundation website, where they are asked to submit their bitcoin address in order to receive a ""gift"" or compensation for losses incurred by the bitcoin price slump.  CoinDesk used a dummy bitcoin address to find out what happens next.  Firstly, the site brings up a notification that the user has won a certain amount of bitcoin, in our case 17.4439042675 BTC. They are then asked to ""login with Blockchain"".  The site then forwards visitors to a site (blockchcain.com) that mimics that of bitcoin wallet and data provider Blockchain. Users attempting to log in and redeem their 'free' bitcoin will actually be giving their password to the scammers.  It is worth noting, however, that the text on the fake Bitcoin foundation site is poorly written and likely not the work of a native English speaker. This makes it simpler for visitors to identify the site as a scam.  Appeal for vigilance  The Bitcoin Foundation urges users to report other similar sites they may come across to webmaster@bitcoinfoundation.org, with the subject line ""SCAM SITE"" and also suggests there may be fake sites in languages other than English.  The foundation said:  ""We are taking steps available to us to help remove these offending websites from the Internet. While we only know of the two, we are continuing to monitor any other additional scam sites.""  This is merely one in a long list of bitcoin scams, but what makes these sites notable is the sheer audacity of the perpetrators, who are trying to pass themselves off as some of the biggest names in bitcoin.

42377872,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rGV,1417532450,ChangeTip Raises $3.5 Million for Bitcoin Micropayments Service,"Bitcoin social tipping startup ChangeTip has announced $3.5m in seed funding, drawing support from a variety of bitcoin-focused investment funds and entrepreneurs.  The seed round was led by Pantera Capital, according to the San Francisco-based startup. Other participants in the round included500 Startups, Boldstart Ventures, CryptoCurrency Partners and Idealab.  ChangeTip  intends to use the funds to build out its infrastructure as well as redouble efforts to continue expanding its user base. Several weeks ago, the popular microtipping service revealed that it had brought in more than 30,000 users since its December 2013 launch, and in recent months has pushed to have its services available on a growing number of online social channels, including Twitter, Reddit and YouTube.  In a statement, founder and CEO Nick Sullivan said that online platforms, powered by bitcoin, have made it easier for concepts of social money to develop, explaining:  “The social media phenomenon of ‘tipping’, or expressing one’s appreciation over the Internet with small monetary or other digital gifts, is building momentum. With ChangeTip, a million users can tip $0.01 and the content creator can collect his $10,000 – an impossibility in a legacy payments world.”  Tipping has been underlined as an early use case for digital currency thanks to the Bitcoin protocol’s facilitation of micropayments, an action most legacy payment systems today do not allow in a cost-effective fashion.  Consumer onramp  Investors involved in the deal say that ChangeTip is in a unique position to help bring more users into bitcoin.  According to Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead, social solutions like ChangeTip’s could provide an easy onramp for those who are interested in digital currencies but may be put off by some of the technical challenges of sending transactions.  Morehead said:  ""Tipping is likely to be bitcoin's first killer app – seamlessly integrated into social media, enabling people to send money in a free, fun, instantaneous way without borders or minimums. This could have a huge impact on bitcoin adoption.""  Morehead added that, in the future, ChangeTip could serve as a mechanism for people to receive their introduction to the industry – as well as their first bitcoins.  500 Startups partner Sean Percival cited CEO Sullivan's enthusiasm and support for digital currency, as well as the long-term promise of the ChangeTip service itself, as reasons why his group decided to get involved. He told CoinDesk that the funding round is only the first step in the startup's plans to deploy bitcoin-powered payment solutions.  ""Safe to say they are just getting started with today’s product offering. We’re very excited to be part of the journey and look forward to what’s next from the team,"" he said.

42377881,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73rRp,1417526437,"BTC China's New Pool Mines 3,325 BTC in Five Weeks","BTC China has announced that its new mining pool, which launched just five weeks ago and is exclusively Chinese, has already generated over $1.2m in bitcoin.  The company said that as of 28th November, the pool had mined 3,325 BTC, or $1,226,758.75 according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index at the time of writing.  Blockchain's Hashrate Distribution Chart ranks the BTC China pool 7th-largest overall, contributing around 13.9 PH/s, or 5% of the world's bitcoin hashing power.  The firm says it ""promises 100% transparency in its hashrate distribution, with no hidden hashrate reductions"". There are also plans to add litecoin mining operations soon.  Zero-fee mining  A spokesperson said the rapid growth could be attributed to BTC China's 0% fees on its pay-per-share (PPS) mining model.  Forming the pool was part of the company's plan to allow users to stay within BTC China's ecosystem for all aspects of their digital currency experience, from mining through to trading, transacting, shopping and storage.  The firm said:  ""BTC China wanted to provide our users with a one-stop digital currency service, to allow our users to engage in all aspects of the digital currency spectrum, in one integrated platform.""  All members of BTC China's mining pool are located in China itself, probably largely because the site is currently available in Chinese only. The company does have plans to launch an English version in the near future.  Broader range of services  The mining pool is part of BTC China's transition from a simple bitcoin exchange to a multi-service cryptocurrency company. In the past few months it has created and launched a margin trading service, the Mobile Exchange mobile web app and a payment gateway called JustPay.  JustPay acquired over 300 new users in its beta-testing phase and the company has already signed up five Chinese businesses to accept bitcoin using the service.  Those businesses are Shenzhoufu Hong Kong, a leading online gaming transaction platform in China with 700 game operators; Aicaike, a financial management platform; DandanChina, an e-commerce site specializing in imported products; Jingubang (JGB), a cross-border e-commerce site focusing on shopping and shipping for Chinese customers; and BTCKan, a provider of bitcoin quotes, news and mining.

42377866,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73r8x,1417521329,MasterCard Seeks 'Level Playing Field' for Bitcoin Regulation,"MasterCard has spoken out against bitcoin's perceived risks and called for regulators to create a ""level playing field"" for payments systems.  The statements were made as part of an ongoing Australian inquiry into digital currencies, headed by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics.  In a document, the credit card company argues that all financial services should be held to the same standard, stating that it is imperative all consumers and merchants are able to conduct business and commerce in a way that is safe and simple for all.  The statement says:  ""It is our view that all participants in the payments system that provide similar services to consumers should be regulated in the same way to achieve a level playing field for all. Moreover, any regulations should be technology neutral to ensure that they can and do apply to all new providers of payment services to consumers, especially with advancements in technology.""  MasterCard  went on to stress that consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), counter -terrorist financing (CTF) and stability should be the cornerstones of any regulation of electronic payments, including digital currencies.  The company supports the definition of a digital currency as any type of digital unit that is used as a medium of exchange, but lacks the attributes of a real currency, while being convertible into real currency.  ""Examples of a digital currency include bitcoin (the predominant digital currency) and Ripple,"" MasterCard says.  Consumer and other risks  MasterCard ""strongly advocates"" the application of industry standards on any payment service, including digital currency, explaining:  ""It must be safe, stable and reliable for consumers; it must provide an accepted value guarantee without exposure to significant fluctuation and risk; and it must offer all the basic protections that consumers and other stakeholders (regulators, governments, banks and merchants) have come to expect.""  Digital currencies currently lack the basic protections consumers expect from MasterCard products, the firm argues, thus exposing them to a number of risks with limited recourse.  The company says that any regulation adopted in Australia should address the anonymity provided by digital currencies, as a way of combating illegal activities.  ""Contrary to transactions made with a MasterCard product, the anonymity of digital currency transactions enables any party to facilitate the purchase of illegal goods or services, to launder money or finance terrorism and to pursue other activity that introduces consumer and social harm without detection by regulatory or police authority,"" the company said.  Volatility is another problem identified by the company, saying it can create ""significant losses"" for adopters and hinder the utility of digital currencies as a reliable means of payment.  The lack of a trusted third party was also seen as a risk, since digital currencies are not backed by banks, administrators or regulators that could intervene in a time of crisis.  ""This means that consumers have no recourse if a digital currency loses its value or if the digital currency system fails,"" MasterCard said.  Industry group speaks out  Ron Tucker, chairman of industry lobby group the Australian Digital Currency Association (ADCCA), said his group was ""delighted to see so many submissions"" to the inquiry.  While not everyone is going to agree on regulatory specifics at this stage, he added, it is important to remember that bitcoin and other digital currencies are new technologies that require new and innovative forms of government oversight.  ""To try and put bitcoin into a pre-existing regulatory structure would be counterproductive and would disadvantage Australia in the global FinTech marketplace ... the technology behind bitcoin means it is safe, secure, transparent and accountable. A transaction cannot be hidden, nor is anonymous.""  Fact-finding mission  The Senate first tasked the Economics References Committee with examining the impact of digital currencies in early October. Submissions closed on 28th November, with a total of 31 individuals and organisations contributing to the inquiry. The Senate held its first hearing on digital currencies last week.  Ripple Labs, CoinJar, BitAwareAustralia, the Bitcoin Foundation, the Bitcoin Association of Australia and the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association have all filed submissions, along with the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Bankers' Association, the Australian Taxation Office and, of course, MasterCard.  The committee is scheduled to report its findings in March 2015.  We have reached out to the Australian bitcoin community and we will update the article upon receiving comment.

US-based customers now have the same option to store fiat currency that Coinbase customers in 13 eurozone countries have enjoyed since September, when it expanded bitcoin buying and selling beyond the US for the first time.  The company posted on its blog that the only way US customers could previously acquire bitcoin without delay was to enable 'instant buy', which requires a credit card.  With the new wallets, users can add USD whenever they like and dip into that balance for instant trades at a later date. They may also use the USD wallets to store proceeds from bitcoin sales and withdraw them to a connected bank account at any point.  Coinbase does not charge fees for deposits and withdrawals made via ACH (automated clearing house) bank transfers.  Cooperation with state regulators  Coinbase counsel Juan Suarez told CoinDesk the company has worked with its legal representatives and state regulators to assess whether its USD wallet is a regulated activity.    He said:      ""Coinbase's cooperation with its regulators in the US and abroad is a priority company investment, and we will continue to collaborate with regulators to establish sanctioned avenues for Coinbase to offer its USD wallet and other Coinbase services – whether the approach is to regulate such services under conventional payments rules and laws, new bitcoin-specific guidance, or not to regulate at all. We hope to offer USD Wallet in all US jurisdictions in the near future.""              To implement the new service, Coinbase needed to repurpose and adapt existing fraud detection algorithms for its ACH buys.    Customers in the following 15 states who have verified their accounts may access USD wallets immediately: Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, South Carolina, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia. The new feature is also available to residents of Puerto Rico.  Coinbase has so far offered customers the simple options of a bitcoin wallet and bitcoin cold storage called 'Vault'.  The company, which is reportedly worth $400m and is seeking to raise $60m to add to its current total $30m in funding, also offers merchant payment gateway tools and a 'one-click' bitcoin tipping tool.

This year, the bitcoin community is seeking to highlight this aspect of the cryptocurrency with Bitcoin Giving Tuesday, which takes place today.  Notably, the BitGive Foundation, Bitcoin Foundation, BitPay, Bitcoin Black Friday, Circle and ChangeTip are all participating in the campaign – an extension of the global #GivingTuesday event that aims to encourage and celebrate generosity.  BitGive founder and executive director Connie Gallippi said the announcement is a soft launch for what she hopes will become an annual event.  Gallippi told CoinDesk:  “With plans for Bitcoin Black Friday already well underway, we planned for cross promotion and a soft launch of Bitcoin Giving Tuesday this year. Next year, BitGive will lead Bitcoin Giving Tuesday as a separate but co-branded event with Bitcoin Black Friday and the rest of our partners.”  Bitcoin-accepting non-profits like Save the Children, American Red Cross, Greenpeace, UnitedWay and the Water Project, among others, are all involved in the initiative and will accept donations in bitcoin through the Bitcoin Giving Tuesday website.  A larger community  In August, BitGive became the first nonprofit bitcoin organization to achieve 501(c)(3) status, making it officially recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a tax-exempt charitable organization in the US.  Since then, BitPay has recruited a number of prominent charities into the bitcoin community, including Save the Children, American Red Cross and Greenpeace.  Gallippi said BitGive aims to raise awareness of the benefits of bitcoin to nonprofit work with reduced fees and transaction costs, welcome new charities into the bitcoin community and promote the work of nonprofit organizations.  The Bitcoin Giving Tuesday website states:  ""Charitable giving should not pad the pockets of credit card companies, banks or any other financial middlemen. 100% of funds given through Bitcoin Giving Tuesday will go to the nonprofit you choose.""  Tipping Tuesday  Tipping service ChangeTip is also promoting Bitcoin Giving Tuesday as part of its #TippingTuesday campaign which seeks to engage users tipping in bitcoin on a number of social media avenues including GitHub, Reddit and Twitter.  Tipping has always been a point of interest for those in the bitcoin community, as it may hold the potential to drive broader bitcoin adoption and encourage micropayments, thereby breaking down barriers in developing countries.  However, the community has only recently begun to see signs of increased tipping activity among users.  ChangeTip has reported a recent surge in volume and interest from consumers, citing 10,000 transactions in one day. In the same month, bitcoin services company Coinbase has introduced its own tipping tool.
