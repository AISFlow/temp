42424948,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Th,1370561123,Beware of Mt.Gox Scam Sites,"As interest in Bitcoin continues to escalate on a global scale, scammers have decided to cash in on the digital currency gold rush by taking advantage of the Internet's less tech savvy users. Over the last several years there have been examples of Trojans stealing Bitcoin wallets and installing Bitcoin miners, however these efforts haven't been terribly complex. Recently. Now there are a slew of Mt.Gox scam sites on the loose, tricking unsuspecting users into thinking they're making a wise investment decision.  A recent example last week demonstrates how far criminal intent has come in the Bitcoin economy. Reports began emerging about phishing websites – as reported by Symantec – that are impersonating Mt.Gox. Although Mt.Gox has seen its fair share of hackers, this is geared toward confusing the user about whether or not they're actually on the correct website to begin with.  Here is how the scam works. The scammers use the same second-level (SLD) domain name as mtgox, but with a different top-level domain (TLD). So, instead of using .com, they will use any of the following – .org, .net, .de, .co, .uk and anything else they can get their hands on such as .edu or.tv. Once one of these dummy sites are reached, the graphics and operation look incredibly similar to the official mtgox.com website.  Once unsuspecting users arrive at the site they are tricked into installing malware with the MTGOX_Wallet.exe file name.  What makes this really sinister is how the phishing websites are using advertising on several major online advertising services such as Microsoft's advertisement network. So, they're shelling out good money to be displayed on incredibly reputable sites and enticing users by stating things like, “New Century Gold: BITCOIN Protect your money – Buy Bitcoin.”  Of course, most semi-savvy Internet users would be put off by the fact that the phishing sites don't use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), but these ads are praying on people who don't know much about Bitcoin, and have only heard the hype about it. This includes the less tech savvy.  As of today, Chrome is already blocking the phishing websites and hopefully other browsers will be doing so as well as to protect users. With all of the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin, especially within demographics that are less knowledgeable about the Internet as a whole, this type of scamming can be really harmful to Bitcoin's reputation.  Just as a heads-up.

42424944,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Lh,1370554902,Coinbase investor: Bitcoin is the currency of the future,"A gathering of A-list entrepreneurs, investors and Bay Area politicians -- Bloomberg's Next Big Thing Summit -- is set to tackle emerging issues in technology and business ... including the future potential of Bitcoin.  Taking over the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay on June 16 and 17, the conference roster reads like a who's who of the tech community, including the head of mergers and acquisitions at Google, CTO of PayPal, California's lieutenant governor and the startup-friendly mayor of San Francisco. It's particularly notable, then, that a highlight of the conference is a sure-to-be-heated, televised debate on Bitcoin.  The debate plan was an eye-opener even for Micky Malka who, as founder and general partner at Ribbit Capital, will be arguing that Bitcoin is the currency of the future. Ribbit invests in companies innovating the consumer financial services space.  ""I was surprised myself,"" said Malka, who is also co-founder and chairman of Lemon, a wallet cloud service. ""As you start to hear very smart people thinking about (Bitcoin) and understanding what it really means, dissecting the bad things from the good things, it becomes a good topic (for debate).""  Malka has been dabbling with Bitcoin for the last year and a half. Having grown up in Venezuela and done business in Latin America, he witnessed the first-hand the effects of hyperinflation.  ""I know economic behavior,"" he said, explaining why he was drawn to the cryptocurrency. Among the financial startups he has invested in is Coinbase, which closed a $5 million round in May. ""I see how people behave when there is a loss of trust.""  As the pro-Bitcoin debater, Malka will go head-to-head with James Rickards, senior managing director of Tangent Capital Partners and author of ""Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis.""  ""When they invited me, the first thing I did was Google him and buy his book,"" said Malka.  Though the debate will be shaped by moderator Dave Goldberg, CEO of SurveyMonkey, Malka said his ""macro argument is very, very simple.""  ""There are five billion people with phones today in the world ... Now, out of those five billion people, only one billion are banked. What are the chances of a bank being good or efficient for four billion people, or is there a chance these four billion people are willing to jump to electronic currency?""  Though it's still too early to determine, he added: ""I'm willing to bet money on the second.""  Bitcoin is beginning to emerge from its shroud of mystery. Though its early days were sometimes mired in illicit activities — Silk Road, anyone? — Malka likens the digital currency's acceptance to the internet: ""They (skeptics) thought it was a place for porn and secret societies, and look how much we have evolved from there.""  With more players and investors, such as Ribbit, entering the game, Bitcoin is gaining in legitimacy.  ""Lots of venture firms are invested in the category,"" Malka said. ""People who are coming in are coming in for the right reason, to do business on top of a protocol that's very disruptive.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Alice Truong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/06/coinbase-investor-bitcoin-is-the-currency-of-the-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c9842a372302dfd6dc83c76ac6a2f3ddc0ed284-628x380.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424960,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6nh,1370522197,How Green is Bitcoin?,"You, like many others, might be forgiven for assuming that, as a digital currency, Bitcoin is green. After all, it exists only online. However, this doesn’t mean it has no impact on the real world. In fact, Bitcoin mining is said to use over $300,000 worth of electricity per day.  How does this happen?  In brief, Bitcoins are generated by computers solving complex mathematical problems. Mining Bitcoins is an interesting issue: computers essentially ‘find’ Bitcoins by solving processor-intensive equations, which get harder as the number of Bitcoins grow. The idea behind the increasing difficulty is one of supply – Bitcoin tries to keep the supply of Bitcoins from growing too quickly, as this would likely significantly devalue the currency. The increasing difficulty mimics the supply of gold and silver in bygone days. For instance, in California when the California Gold Rush first started in 1848, everyday gold panners and miners were able to get ample quantities of gold working on their own, with gold pans and shovels. Gold was a very plentiful resource. However, as time went on and the top gold became more scarce (as it had already been mined), it became more and more difficult to ‘uncover’ the gold. This is the type of situation that Bitcoin appears to be emulating.  Today, with almost half of all Bitcoins in circulation (the currency comes with an inherent cap of 21 million Bitcoins), the mathematical problems required to mine Bitcoins require so much processor power that it is often done with specialized computers; i.e. ASICs as found from Butterfly Labs. This requires a huge amount of electricity.  Blockchain.info  , a site that tracks Bitcoin mining data, gives an estimated electricity consumption of 2,045.17 megawatt hours, for a total of $306,774.97 per day. This cost naturally doesn’t factor into consideration the vast cost of energy and resources required to make and run the computers themselves.  How can this be justified?  Well, to start with, the $306,000 worth of electricity being used results in almost $354,000 of profits a day. This makes it quite lucrative for Bitcoin miners (though less so than in April, when Bloomberg reported a daily profit of over $600,000). With this type of payday, most miners certainly can find reasons ($) to justify using this process.  Is the use of ‘real world’ resources worth the virtual return? Should we return to the days where mining for our currency (e.g. gold and silver) required huge amounts of energy and resources? I think Bitcoin mining is a far cry from the “environmental disaster” that Mark Gimein of Bloomberg reported in April. However, in these days of global warming, and focus on reducing energy usage, I find it hard to hail a currency that requires intensive energy usage (which will only grow as the problems get harder) as the ‘currency of the future’.

42424963,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6rh,1370518706,How to get verified at Mt. Gox,"Bitcoin is said to be an anonymous currency. While it’s true that bitcoin addresses are not linked to any sort of real-world identity, it gets complicated when you try to convert bitcoins into world currency. Mt. Gox recently started requiring real-world identification of its members before they could transfer real-world funds into their accounts, which is a fundamental part of using any currency exchange! Assuming you're not quitting Mt. Gox, here's our guide on how to get verified.  Step 1 – Sign up.  If you haven't joined already, you'll need an account at Mt. Gox. Head over to http://www.mtgox.com, and click the signup link.  Step 2 – Confirm your email address  Once you've given your username and password, you'll receive an email with a confirmation code that you can either paste into the website or just click the link in the email.  Step 3 – Fill in your details.  As you are guided through the signup process, you'll be brought to a page where you have to fill in your physical address. Complete this form and click Next.  Step 4 – Provide Photo ID  Next you'll have to provide a photo or PDF scan of some photo ID. It can be a passport, drivers licence or national ID card. Type in the ID number on the page form, and click the ""Choose File"" button and select the image or PDF of your card.  Step 5 – Provide Proof of residency.  Next you'll need to prove you live where you say you do. You can provide a monthly utility bill, Internet bill, cellphone bill, a tax return, residency certificate or medical insurance bill. Again you can provide a photo (.jpg or .png) of the document or a PDF scan. The other stipulation is that the document must have been issued within the last six months.  Again, click the ""Choose File"" button to select the corresponding file on your computer. Note, when I first uploaded my pair of scans, for some reason they were rejected. Fortunately, you can upload multiple proofs of residency, so I uploaded another utility bill. Almost instantly, I received an email telling me I was verified.  Notes on scanning  If you don't have a scanner, or you're in a rush, there are reliable scanning apps out there for your smartphone. We recommend CamScanner for Android and Scanner Pro for the iPhone.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/06/how-to-get-verified-at-mt-gox,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7968f41057e5a8bc37e8883826e402a19368367f-628x303.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424958,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6lh,1370509029,Should you mine for profit or proteins?,"As ASIC miners begin pushing GPU users off the Bitcoin network, could they use their rigs to battle Alzheimer’s disease and cancer? One academic hopes to pick up some spare computing power from cryptocurrency miners and put it to good use.  Stanford University professor Vijay Pande would like coin miners’ help with his scientific project, Folding@home, which uses donated computing power to help find cures for devastating diseases. He also helps run the Stanford Bitcoin Group, which conducts research into Bitcoin theory and applications.  ""There are multiple people emailing me describing the natural synergies between Folding@home and the way Bitcoin works,"" he said.  Crowdsourced scientific computing emerged in the early 2000s, scientists realized that lots of spare computing capacity was sitting dormant, and that those computers were now connected via the Internet. They developed software to distribute computing tasks between many distributed machines, which could work on pieces of them concurrently, contributing to a bigger goal. At the time, people called this concept grid computing.  One of the first grid projects was Seti@home, a UC Berkeley project released in 1999, a year before Folding@home. That project used peoples’ computers to analyse signals picked up by radio telescopes to see if they could find patterns indicating signals from intelligent life.  But whereas Seti@home looked to the heavens for answers, Folding@home looked inside the body. The distributed computers used by Folding@home are simulating proteins. Proteins must assemble themselves (fold) before they can do their jobs. When they do not fold correctly, they can contribute to diseases including Alzheimers, Parkinson's, and AIDS.  The Folding@home project uses computing power to better understand how proteins misfold themselves. This can give researchers a better chance at designing drugs and other therapies to fight the resulting illness - and it's working.  “Our primary disease interest has been Alzheimers, and we have a drug candidate that we're now starting to work on,” said Pande. The group has also put in place some pilot projects to research cancer. “Now that computers have got more powerful we can go after certain kinases,” he says. These are enzymes that send messages between cells, and modify specific protein behaviours. Cancerous cells can warp a kinase’s messaging, leading to misbehaviours in proteins.  Current chemotherapy takes the nuclear option to stopping these faulty kinases. “The reason why chemotherapy is so nasty is that it doesn’t shut down just one kinase, it shuts down many of them, and that will lead to all of these nasty side effects,” Pande said. “We’re pushing to design drugs that are selective, so that you could kill the cancer at higher doses, but not have these nasty side effects that almost kill the patient at the same time.”  But to do that, he needs computing power. The more, the better. Bitcoin and crowd sourced calculation projects such as Folding@home both make use of heavy floating point calculations, which GPUs are very good at. And like Bitcoin, Folding@home is able to use GPU power from across the Internet.  Unlike bitcoin mining, which measures computing in hashes, these scientific projects concentrate on floating point operations per second (FLOPS). Today, Folding@home has access to the equivalent of around 14 x86-based Petaflops. Allowing for the fact that people don't run the Folding@home software all the time, and some machines are less powerful than others, he estimates that this is the equivalent of 20,000 GPUs out in the field.  ""If we could get 100,000 GPUs, then that could easily be a 5 to 10 fold increase,"" says Pande.  Couldn’t the bitcoin network spare a few flops? Back in May, we reported that the network had hit over a thousand Petaflops. In a little over three weeks, it has hit over 14,000 Petaflops – a thousand times Folding@home’s current rate. ASICs don’t deal in flops, so that calculation won’t be entirely accurate, but then, as more ASIC rigs mine for bitcoins (which is the only thing they are built to do), they will push out GPUs anyway.  Those GPU owners might decide to turn their attention to protein folding, but it’s equally likely that a lot of them will switch to mining other currencies, such as Litecoin. There are more altcoins every week, it seems, beckoning people to mine them for potential long-term profit.  Ultimately, as one bright spot on a Reddit thread suggested, someone would develop a crypto currency that could solve scientific problems during the mining process – effectively solving problems for professors while also finding coins. This is much harder than it looks, warns Pande.  “The dream is to come up with a proof of work function that could be useful for science,” he says. “That's challenging to do, because it has to be something that we care about that is difficult to compute but easy to verify.”  It is hard to combine these three factors – scientific relevance, difficulty of calculation, and ease of verification. “The last two are easy with hashing, the first two are easy with our research. But the verification part is hard to do.”  In the meantime, Stanford is relying on two things to motivate participants: firstly, simply being a stand-up human being. Secondly, gamification.  The problem with projects like Folding@home is that the rewards are longer term, and more difficult to quantify. Conversely, the returns for crypto currency miners are tangible, and frequent. Human beings like fast, simple rewards. The Stanford team has tried to motivate participants by awarding points for work units completed. It invites people to create teams that compete with each other across the globe. Although they did this long before Satoshi wrote his paper, we can liken it vaguely to a mining pool.  Is there a way to marry this quest for profit and protein? It seems unlikely that people would be able to trade the work units completed by Folding@home participants and start giving them value relative to a currency, because there is no supporting verification and tracking capability to exchange them.  Perhaps someone might see fit to develop superior mining software that also allows GPU users to divide their processing time between cryptocurrency mining and scientific projects such as Folding@home. Then, they could give some of their GPU time to a good cause while also mining for coins, with minimal effort.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/06/should-you-mine-for-profit-or-proteins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fbe2dbfe5c3008990d2d78c5ae10a7169f8046e-500x339.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424956,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6hh,1370505106,China's romance with Bitcoin continues,"Why is China's interest in Bitcoin growing? The country’s increased interest in the currency has shown no signs of abating over the past couple of months, leading to all kinds of fun theories about currency wars.  Chinese downloads of the original Satoshi client, as maintained by the Bitcoin core development team, have increased in recent months. For the month of January, China ranked seventh amongst downloaders of the software, accounting for just 3.66 percent of downloads. As recently as April, Chinese downloads accounted for 13.15 percent of the total, lagging the US, which downloaded 27 percent of the clients. Play with the charts here.  Things have changed considerably over the last month. From the start of May until June 4, China soared to the top of the charts, surpassing even the US. During that period, Chinese addresses accounted for just over one quarter of all downloads of the original Bitcoin client. The US had a still-respectable 21.94 percent.  The signs are that China is using them, too. The Bitnodes project, which maps node activity around the world, shows China clearly in the lead, with 22.8 percent of the active nodes, compared to 20.2 percent in the US, which is second ahead of Germany.  So, why is it happening? ""China seems to be actively encouraging its population to take it up,"" argued Johnathan Turrall, co-founder of MetaLair, the software company promising the still-elusive, decentralized, peer-to-peer crypto county exchange system.  ""It is showing it on TV, and explaining to people how they can take it in payment for their business. Nothing goes on TV in China without the say-so of the party,"" he said. ""The party never does anything officially, but if it's on TV, it's being endorsed.""  Here is an online video of the TV show (click CC for subtitles):  Others spotted this trend early. The Genesis Block noticed a spike in Chinese downloads in early May, shortly after the video allegedly aired, and attributed it to the beginnings of a currency war between China and the US. It pointed to China's 2009 appeal to replace the dollar as a global reserve currency, and further saber-rattling since. It also pointed out China’s position as a major holder of US currency, arguing that if enough trade switched to Bitcoin, China could begin leaking US dollars onto the market, driving down the reserve currency’s value (although some might argue that the Fed doesn't need any help).  Not everyone is convinced that this is an engineered attempt to pump bitcoins at the expense of US currency, though. “I’m sure there are many people in China fascinated by money in all its various forms, and so a non-fiat money is especially interesting and the media would respond to this,” said Barry Naughton, a professor of Chinese economy at UC San Diego, adding that he doubted China was endorsing Bitcoin.  “Also, since China’s capital account is still not open, people will be especially interested in something that might allow them more freedom with their money, including the freedom to move it offshore,” he added.  Apparently, Bitcoin isn't China's only dalliance with cryptocurrencies. In early May, someone introduced ChinaCoin (CNCoin), and got some initial interest from the community, including a couple of test mining pools. However, support for this coin quickly faded, and even its discussion forum failed to materialize. The person who introduced the coin on Bitcointalk was a relatively new poster, and the coin languished.  One final thought is that China has 1.35 billion people, compared to the US's 314 million. If interest in Bitcoin spreads virally in China, as it has elsewhere in the past few months, it is perhaps unsurprising that the numbers jumped so quickly in a short period of time. The upward trajectory of Chinese nodes shows no sign of slowing, but what would be really interesting is a statistic showing the hash rate coming from China. We're still looking for that – if any readers have any pointers, please let us know in the comments.
