42425380,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwP5h,1391466408,"BTC-e Downplays Concerns of Criminal Investigation, Now Revealed as Hoax","UPDATE (4th February, 08:43 GMT):      New information has come to light that shows the criminal investigation may have in fact been a hoax.      -------------------------------      The eighth largest bitcoin exchange by volume, BTC-e is now ""under investigation"" by the Prosecutor's Office of the Volgograd region in Russia.    English translations of the press release issued on behalf of the office suggest that the agency is initiating a criminal case against the exchange and its online resources.    Speaking to CoinDesk, representatives from BTC-e denied any wrongdoing and reiterated that they are not worried about any potential actions by Russian authorities. However, BTC-e did move to increase fees on USD, RUR and EUR transactions following the announcement.      Law enforcement officials are specifically looking to block the BTC-e website in Russia, under a new law that allows it to shut down websites that are associated with terrorism or other types of potentially dangerous extremism.      Russian authorities suggest that BTC-e is being investigated for the laundering of criminal funds as well as fraud. Notably, the comments come one week after the Bank of Russia announced that issuing alternative currencies in the Russian Federation is prohibited.    BTC-e unconcerned    BTC-e representatives were confident that Russia's actions will not be detrimental to their operations. A spokesperson implied that BTC-e faces little risk, as it does not have any offices in Russia or work with any Russian banks. Its founders Aleksey and Alexander, while residents of Russia, are not citizens.      The often-perceived secrecy with which it conducts operations could even bring some comfort to the organization. As noted in our 11th December report on the exchange:      ""BTC-e is anything but transparent: it uses third-party banking services to keep its name out of official records. At least one of the banks involved in the process is located in the Czech Republic; the BTC-e site references Bulgaria in its SEO descriptions; the founders, Russian programmers Aleksey and Alexander, honed their skills at the Skolkovo tech park; and the BTC-e managing company is based in Cyprus.""            Reaction    Trading volumes on BTC-e remained unaffected by the news as evidenced by the stable prices on the exchange at press time, coupled with open talk of the actions on the website's central forum.      When asked whether the actions would restrict the ability of the exchange to handle new Russian deposits, the organization said only that this would ""depend on the laws that will take in Russia"".      Furthermore, a nationwide ban, while potentially prohibiting new participants from accessing the exchange, would likely not be able to deter BTC-e's use by its existing base. BTC-e users could still rely on the anonymous TOR network or utilize VPNs to conduct transactions.      In addition, service interruptions are certainly not unknown to site users. Last December, BTC-e reported banking issues due to updates of their service architecture that would likely affect users until January.

42425389,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwPNh,1391460169,US Postal Service Explores Adding Bitcoin Exchanges,"While the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) successfully monopolized media attention last week by assembling a cast of bitcoin A-listers at its regulatory hearing, it wasn't the only government agency to explore virtual currencies in a way that could impact the global community.    On 29th January, the US Postal Service (USPS) Office of Inspector Generalhttp://www.uspsoig.gov/ (OIG) held a webinar on virtual currency attended by representatives from the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and World Bank that sought to ""explore the possibility"" of a ""potential role"" for bitcoin at post offices around the globe.    Topics included whether post offices could leverage their physical locations to act as in-person bitcoin exchanges and if they could color coins as a way to underpin bitcoin's value and increase adoption.      Darrell Duane, a Washington, DC-based bitcoin consultant who was initially approached by the USPS and later helped promote the event, said that though much of the material was educational, there were some suggestions that, if adopted, could have big implications for the bitcoin community.      ""There were suggestions like if someone made 'postcoin', 'What would that be?' 'How could that help?' If we were to employ the technology to support post office operations around the world, internationally, how could cryptocurrency help post offices do their business?"" Duane said.              Experts from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Booz Allen Hamilton, George Mason University and the Bitcoin Foundation were on hand to speak about bitcoin, its use cases and its implications for the wider economy as part of the two-and-a-half-hour meeting.    Bitcoin's role for postal operators    With much of the first part of the day's discussion devoted to the introductory aspects of bitcoin, the latter half more directly addressed how virtual currency could revolutionize post office operations.      Christian Jaag, managing partner at Swiss Economics, began this section of the event by naming certain characteristics of bitcoin that he believed would be of a particular interest to the discussion: These included bitcoin's algorithmic money creation, decentralized ledger, peer-to-peer nature and sometimes volatile exchange rate.      ""There's a great challenge to postal operators lately, postal volumes are decreasing, people do not go to post offices as often as they used to. However, postal operators have to maintain their networks, they have to look for new ways to fill their offices up and one potential contact point is the exchange of virtual currencies to other currencies,"" Jaag said.              Jaag suggested that post offices would be able to use their existing money transmitter licenses to facilitate these exchanges, gain a greater level of involvement in e-commerce and attract increased revenue.    Introducing a 'postcoin'    Jaag went on to discuss how colored bitcoins could benefit post offices, theorizing that, with their global network and strong reputation, postal providers could mark existing bitcoins as a way to provide a safeguard against wealth loss and incentivize virtual currency adoption.      ""You can take one bitcoin and declare it to represent your monetary base of postcoin, and you can then issue fractions of bitcoins freely and back it by something else,"" Jaag stated.              Jaag said this would allow a postcoin to become a full reserve currency used by postal operators. Post offices would, in turn, be able to make transactions with its coins reversible, as well as facilitate the trade of bitcoin and other local currencies.      ""There's no need for institution, but there is a role for institution,"" Jaag said in summary.            Impact on international e-commerce    Following Jaag, José Anson, an economist at UPU International Bureau, spoke about bitcoin's potential to act as a ""form of trade facilitation"", bringing online transactions under the supervision of post offices and allowing for a synchronization of activities through the protocol's ability to validate contracts.      ""There is a possibility of synchronizing a number of activities that could foster much more trust in international trade and international financial exchanges,"" Anson said.              Under this system, international e-commerce transactions would be ""simplified"" by a merging of activities that would find postal services verifying the security of deliveries, confirming transactions and facilitating more cost-effective payments between parties.      ""It goes beyond payment and financial, it's a matter of trade inclusion for many small entrepreneurs around the world and integrating all these parties into the world trading system,"" Anson stated.    One option of many  While interesting to those in the virtual currency space, the news notably comes roughly a week after the OIG published a white paperhttp://www.uspsoig.gov/blog/filling-gap-postal-service-and-financially-underserved addressing how it could better extend its services to those who don't have access to traditional bank accounts and financial services.    That paper explored whether the USPS would benefit from issuing prepaid cards, payday loans, international money transfers and mobile banking options, among other programs. Researchers cited the fact that 90% of underbanked US consumers now have a mobile phone as a compelling reason for mobile banking's consideration.      Though it did not mention bitcoin specifically, the paper's stated goals will doubtless be familiar to the bitcoin community as compelling reasons for its use:      ""A suite of non-bank financial services offered through the Postal Service - available online, through mobile devices and at Post Offices in every community - could greatly benefit families everywhere. Postal financial services could help American families to save money through avoiding exorbitant fees and interest,"" the report read.            Postal Service struggles to stay viable  The USPS has been a focal point of public debate in the US for years, as the agency now costs the federal government $15.9bn annually to operate a time when tensions over the growing federal deficit continue to dominate political discourse.  Further driving the need to explore additional revenue streams is the erosion of the USPS' core business as a result of rising Internet use. Letter writing has declined by 25% since 2010, while the majority - 56% of bills - are now paid electronically.  However, any further action on virtual currency is likely to take time. According to one inside source, speaking to Bloomberg, the implementation of virtual currency services could be ""years"" away for the USPS.

42425386,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwPJh,1391446833,‘500 Startups’ Recruits Ex-MySpace VP to Mentor Bitcoin Businesses,"California-based accelerator 500 Startups has announced plans to invest in bitcoin-related companies.  The company also trumpeted that is bringing on a high-profile partner to help facilitate that effort: Sean Percival – former vice president of MySpace and internet entrepreneur focused on consumer marketing.  “I’m joining 500 as a venture partner with a focus on bitcoin,” Percival told CoinDesk.    Passion for bitcoin        The incubator, which has its base in Mountain View, San Francisco, is currently taking applications for its next batch of startups. Percival says that they are looking for around three to five bitcoin companies within a total of 30 startups for its next class.  The companies will get seed funding and office space, in addition to other support. Percival will be investing his own money in some of the bitcoin-centric ideas.  “I will be making [a variety of] investments, but the majority of investments I’m focused on are bitcoin-related. That’s been a passion for me for about a year and a half now,” he said.  “I know there’s a lot of good, early stage ideas out there.”  “I will be looking for early stage bitcoin companies that either want to join the accelerator or, maybe at a later stage, that want to receive an investment from 500 Startups,” he said.  Percival also plans on casting a wide net in terms of finding cryptocurrency companies in need of venture capital. The search doesn’t necessarily pertain only to new bitcoin startups.    Marketing 101        The relationship between 500 Startups and Percival has been bubbling along for a while. Now, though, the two sides have decided to officially team up and bring even more marketing prowess to early stage companies.  “I’ve been working with [500 Startups] for a year now, in sort of a part-time role. [...] I’ve basically been working with our portfolio companies, helping them understand marketing,” he said.  “They are very early stage companies, so it’s a lot of the basics.”  Percival pointed out that he already has experience with a bitcoin-related company – working with Blockchain.info on marketing and consumer-adoption projects.  “I also do some work at Blockchain. Basically, I’m sort of a marketing advisor.”  Percival is convinced that a more mainstream approach to marketing is necessary for bitcoin acceptance.  “Right now, the majority of marketing is being done to a small group of early adopters. Outside of that, consumer interest is continuing to grow this year, so the industry needs to prepare for that.”    New York vs Silicon Valley?        Until now, banking recalcitrance has been a thorn in the side of many bitcoin startups, but Percival feels like that issue will be resolved very soon.  “It feels like we’re getting really close. We have Wells Fargo, that’s engaging in the community, we have these hearings going on,” he said.  “I do believe that, in 2014, there will be the regulation needed so these companies can easily get that bank account and actually operate like a company.”  When asked about the pros and cons of New York vs Silicon Valley when it comes to cryptocurrency-related startups choosing a location, Percival had some interesting insight.  Many of the financial technology developers are based in New York, but some of them, he said, may prove amenable to joining a startup in Northern California, in order to stake a place in the bitcoin revolution.  “In the New York tech scene, a lot of engineers want to move over to startups, but their skill set is not a match,“ Percival said.  “This may be a case where their financial programming skill set is going to be a great match for bitcoin companies.”    Building the ecosystem        Getting the average person up and running with bitcoin should be a popular business idea in the startup space. That is something 500 Startups is specifically looking for.  “We’re looking for things that ease the on ramp of user adoption and consumer adoption. Right now, it’s a little bit tough,” said Percival.  “Encryption, the managing of passwords and two-factor authentication – these are sort of difficult for the average person to jump on board with.”  Concepts that build off the blockchain itself are also an area that Percival feels are worth investing in.  “Anyone that’s really leveraging the technology of the public ledger of the blockchain to do something different, that’s something I’m very interested in.”  Percival says that he came across bitcoin over a year and a half ago and had an epiphany. “It was one of those moments where I just realized that this was technology that was going to change the world,” he said.  “We now have billions of users online or with a phone. This industry is going to be just like the internet boom, but much, much faster. I’m just very excited to kind of build of the ecosystem and be at the ground floor.”  The application gateway for 500 Startups' next batch of young companies can be found on AngelList.  Bitcoin-focused businesses are, of course, encouraged to get in touch.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/03/500-startups-recruits-ex-myspace-vp-to-mentor-bitcoin-businesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3459d30818ba0b34e7f608fa9ca2ede41033fbc6-1026x1027.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422931,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymhh,1391443184,Singapore's First Bitcoin ATM to Arrive in March,"A Singapore company is planning to install the island's first bitcoin ATM by April.  The firm, Bitcoin Exchange, has purchased a Lamassu unit that it expects will arrive mid-March. It plans to install more ATMs if the first unit is well received. Zann Kwan, one of the company's directors, said:  “The good thing is that the Singapore government has left bitcoin alone. It's treated like silver or gold, and if you want to [deal in it] it's at your own risk. The ATM will create a lot more interest in bitcoin.”  According to Kwan, the machine’s location hasn’t been decided just yet. The company is looking for a location inside one of Singapore’s many shopping malls.  Kwan made it clear that the ATM would not charge a fee for each transaction, supplying bitcoin at a premium to market rates instead. She said the company had not decided what exchange it would take its rates from yet.  The Singapore bitcoin economy has been growing, although it’s still mainly driven by early adopters, she added:  “There are a few bars that are accepting bitcoins now, and people are talking about it. But you need a few people to start the ball rolling, then the momentum will pick up.”  Bartini Kitchen  One of the republic’s cryptocurrency-accepting bars is Bartini Kitchen. The cocktail bar and restaurant, located in the heart of the city's financial district, began accepting bitcoin payments at the end of November.  Several customers have paid for their food and drinks from Bartini Kitchen's modern European menu in bitcoin since then, according to bartender Amir. He said:  “There’ve been just a few transactions, not many of our customers know about bitcoin. But overall, it’s been a positive response.”  Bartini Kitchen draws a cosmopolitan after-work crowd from the office towers that dominate the skyline in this part of town. The restaurant is part of a group of seven other bars and eateries, including a Japanese restaurant called Mariko's that also takes bitcoin.  According to Amir, the group's management are keen bitcoin supporters. Bartini’s mixologists are led by Barnaby Murdoch, a British expat who mixed drinks at London nightspots Kitts, Rudy’s Revenge and Rubicon.  Singapore’s tax authority issued guidelines on how to tax bitcoin back in December, becoming one of the world’s first regulatory institutions to do so. The republic is also the base of digital currency startups, like payment processor GoCoin and Ripple Singapore, a bullion exchange using the Ripple network.

42425381,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwP9h,1391436755,CoinTerra Battles With Performance Issues and Security Breach,"CoinTerra is offering compensation to early adopters of its latest TerraMiner IV mining rigs, based on the GoldStrike I ASIC.  All customers who ordered the first batch of TerraMiner IV units, scheduled to ship in December, will now receive a second rig, free of charge.  Although the first batch was originally supposed to ship in December, it was actually shipped last week. The second batch was pushed back from January to February, while those who ordered TerraMiner IV units from subsequent batches should get the miners on time, The Register reports.  Not quite 2TH/s  CoinTerra  was hoping that its TerraMiner IV rigs would hit 2TH/s, but production units are actually running at 1.63TH/s to 1.72TH/s. The power draw is between 1900W and 2100W, substantially higher than the 1650W the company predicted.  In other words, the rigs are about 20% slower and consume 20% more power than promised.  Even so, these are the fastest rigs money can buy at the moment, and getting them ready was by no means easy. Nothing ever runs smoothly in the world of silicon, and the company has faced a fair few challenges so far.  CoinTerra CEO Raviy Iyengar said the company had to put “immense” pressure on GlobalFoundries, going from tape out on 8th November to packaged and tested silicon on 28th December. Needless to say, that still wasn’t enough to ship the first batch on time.  Iyengar insists that the new GoldStrike I ASIC meets or exceeds the published spec. However, performance was dragged down by power circuit inefficiencies on the boards. The company is now working to improve the boards, Iyengar said:  “We are somewhat under spec, but the improvements we are working on in the lab have shown improved performance getting us closer to the advertised system performance.”  Confirmed security breach  As if board issues weren’t enough, the company also suffered a security breach over the weekend. CoinTerra said the attack was detected on Sunday and it is still investigating.  For the time being, the scope of the attack remains unclear. However, CoinTerra was quick to reassure customers that they won’t be affected:  “A small number of customers who paid for their order with bitcoin between January 31st and February 2nd may have been affected and we are in the process of reaching out to those customers directly. Note that this will not affect the current shipping schedule of our units to customers this week.”  CoinTerra also urges all customers who received any “suspicious emails” regarding their orders over the last few days to get in touch. It seems the emails were promising customers some rather shady deals.  Some messages were promising to move orders to an earlier batch in exchange for a payment via bitcoin, while others were offering to sell cancelled orders: the attackers were obviously planning to make a quick buck on CoinTerra’s delay.  “We would like to make it very clear that CoinTerra has a strict policy of never offering new customers the option to buy into an earlier batch ahead of existing customers, or of offering discounts or free shipping in return for quick payment,” the company stressed.  When it rains it pours, especially in the world of bitcoin ASICs. CoinTerra is not the only company dealing with lengthy delays and performance issues – in fact, most mining hardware outfits are facing similar woes.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/03/cointerra-battles-with-performance-issues-and-security-breach,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/779f25ef09eb1f9f83caa990be8db44ae17f2061-1024x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425372,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwOph,1391431554,Luxury Yacht Service Makes its First Bitcoin Booking,"Luxury yacht service The Advantaged Yacht Charter and Sales in Miami Beach has received its first booking paid for in bitcoin.  The company officially began accepting bitcoin in October last year, but only made its first booking, paid for with the digital currency, last week.  The company has a total of 26 boats in Miami Beach which it rents out, starting from $1,200 for four hours up to $18,000 for the most extravagant packages. Each one comes complete with a captain, a stewardess and a fruit and cheese platter.  Their first bitcoin deal came about after Tony Gallippi, owner of payment processor BitPay gave the company a shout out during his opening speech at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami.  Jessica Londono, co-owner of The Advantaged Yacht Charter and Sales in Miami Beach, was at the conference, as was her first bitcoin client. She explained:  “[Gallippi] just literally said a small little blurb about us, then my client went on and Googled me, saw the website, saw we accept bitcoin and then called me.""  Londono was able to effortlessly process the transaction for her client's $2,500 charter using BitPay.  “It was literally the easiest transaction I’ve ever done,” she said. “I’ve co-owned the company for about nine years and this transaction took less than one minute.""  Londono sent her client an email with the contract for his charter and the BitPay address. “It’s so much easier than any credit card transaction I’ve ever done,"" she added.  Nominal charges  As well as being a much quicker process, accepting bitcoin is also cheaper for vendors, as payment processors such as BitPay require a nominal charge in comparison to credit card charges. Londono said:  “American Express charges about 3.5%, which we lose out of our profits. Bitcoin is essentially free, depending on what service you use.”  Using bitcoin also makes the booking process simpler for Londono’s clients.  Londono first got into bitcoin in March 2012 through her “Apple genius husband”. Now her company, which also deals in yacht sales, is in the process of completing its first boat sale in bitcoin.  She stresses bitcoin is not simply a get-rich-quick scheme for her; it’s about exposure. Going to networking events like the Miami conference has been an opportunity to meet other eager people within the bitcoin community.  “I go to networking events on a daily basis trying to promote my brand, but it was so refreshing to go somewhere where every single person was so happy to talk to you and explain what they do,” she said.  “Everyone’s so excited about bitcoin that it’s just a pleasure to go ahead and get more involved and have more people be part of the bitcoin community.”  She hopes more vendors in South Florida will start to accept bitcoin payments soon.  “We have so many people with foreign currency that this would be an easy way to just unify us all.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Hannah Summersfield,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/03/luxury-yacht-service-makes-its-first-bitcoin-booking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c8c4d23c8460198dd0bb02fa13ff996bb9938af-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425375,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwOth,1391427051,100 Bitcoin ATMs to Land in Australia Soon,"100 bitcoin ATMs are about to hit the streets of Australia, according to a local radio report.  This weekend, state broadcaster ABC ran a short report on bitcoin during its current affairs program The World Today. It included the news that a company called Australian Bitcoin ATMs would be distributing ATM machines all over the country.  The report didn't give away many specifics about the project or the company, and the brand of the ATMs wasn't mentioned. CEO Chris Guzowski said:  ""You can type in how many bitcoins you want to sell, then our ATM goes onto an overseas bitcoin exchange and executes that transaction for you and will spit out the cash for which you sold the bitcoin for. And the opposite also applies, so you can put cash in and purchase bitcoin.""  This information suggests that the ATMs will be two-way, and the image on the company's website shows they're likely to be Robocoin machines.  The interview also quoted David Glance from the University of Western Australia's Centre for Software Practice as saying it will take more than ATMs to facilitate mass adoption:  ""I think that until you see the National Australia Bank or the Commonwealth or one of the major banks getting behind the currency, providing simplified access to it, I think it's always going to be a niche,"" he said.  Banks and regulators  In fact, National Australia Bank (NAB) has done just that already. After the Commonwealth Bank shut down business and personal accounts belonging to Melbourne-based payment processor CoinJar and its founder, NAB approached the company with an offer to help it manage its bitcoin affairs.  NAB also published a mostly-positive internal research paper on bitcoin for FX traders, saying that while bitcoin did not meet the legal definition of a 'currency', it is everything a currency is supposed to be: durable, portable, fungible and divisible.  Australian regulators have not issued any formal guidelines on bitcoin just yet. But the governor of its central bank did pass on a casual warning about ""speculative excesses"" in a newspaper interview last December.  CoinDesk has contacted Australian Bitcoin ATMs and the Australian Bitcoin Association for comment on this story, and will update.

42425391,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwPPh,1391421288,Hive's Bitcoin Wallet is out of Beta for OS X Users,"Hive  , which develops bitcoin wallet software, has come out of beta.  The company recently released a stable version of its wallet, currently available for Mac OS X.  Hive's strategy for bitcoin wallets is to build software that is well-designed and accessible.  Making bitcoin simple  ""Bitcoin is not always considered an easy concept for the masses to understand. Hive’s goal is to change that,"" said Wendell Davis, the company's CEO.  ""We’re trying to demystify the wallet. We’re trying to provide a really good on-ramping service for new users of bitcoin.""  Other platforms for Hive, such as Android, are expected to arrive soon, according to the company.  Last November, Hive purchased the Android wallet Bridgewalker, bringing developer Jan Vornberger on board with the company to help with mobile development.  “We do have the Android version coming in late spring,” Davis said.  Unlike some other wallets, it is Hive’s strategy to build a refined product in terms of design.  The intention is to captivate users who might not be as technical as some of bitcoin's earlier adopters – a key for the currency to keep growing.  More about Hive  Davis told CoinDesk that Blockchain.info and Kryptokit are Hive's biggest wallet competitors right now.  The company consists of eight people working full-time on the project. Hive has received investment from Seedcoin and Roger Ver. Davis, who was an early bitcoin investor, also has invested ""a little bit of money"" in the company.  Hive's workforce is globally distributed – something that Davis believes is the future for many businesses.  Distribution is important to Hive, the company is planning to build a system that will allow the future mobile wallet, for instance, to communicate with the desktop one.  “We’re in the process of having a network to share contact data,” he said.  ""We’re all about decentralization, about the wallet being resilient and it working everywhere.""  Monetization and security  Hive's plan for making money is through its own app platform. Davis believes that his company can build a gateway into the world of cryptocurrencies.  “I liken Hive as something like a portal, something like a browser,” he said.  As a result, Davis plans on Hive taking small transaction fees inside apps through the Hive App Store. The concept is still nebulous, but Davis intimates that the company is testing out some transaction-centric revenue ideas.  The Hive App Store would clearly be a play to monetize from value-added products and services that are added on top of the bitcoin wallets.  Wallet security is important in the bitcoin space and it is Hive’s mission to provide a secure solution that also protects the privacy of its users.  That's why, in a world primarily made up of hosted web-based wallets, Hive decided to start with building a native-installed desktop version first.  ""We took this initial approach because at the time when we were thinking about it, it made the most sense,"" he said.  “I like the idea of a desktop wallet because you can secure your money.""  ""But there’s caveats to that too. That’s why we’ve integrated things like automatic backups so the user doesn’t have to think about things like that,"" Davis said.  Obtaining users  Hive has already had a promising number of people download its wallet.  ""We have had over 10,000 people download Hive already,"" Davis said.  Davis believes that symposiums like the North American Bitcoin Conference are a great way to captivate new bitcoin users.  He was a speaker, on the startup panel and had a booth there. The company plans to continue to exhibit at conferences like the one in Miami.  Hive's simple user setup guide, its contacts book and app store is an updated way of thinking about what a bitcoin wallet can be.  But it's probably just the beginning of what is possible for the future of crypto-based wallets. Davis realizes that's where Hive can really be a valuable as a company and potentially a brand.  ""What a wallet is a year from now, the whole idea I think is in flux,"" he said.  Figuring out how to integrate innovative ideas like multisig transactions and hierarchical deterministic concepts into a user-friendly wallet is one thing that Hive can bring to the table.  ""That’s sort of our job, where we take a user’s hand and walk them through really technical stuff,"" Davis said.  The Hive wallet software is available as a free Mac OS X download on the company’s website.  Disclaimer: This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of Hive.
