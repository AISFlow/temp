42404693,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkJ9c,1592346631,Ex-Bitcoin Dev Settles Defamation Suit Over Sex Assault Claims,"Former Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd has settled his defamation lawsuit against fellow privacy-tech expert Isis Lovecruft, who tweeted in February 2019 that Todd was a “rapist.”      Lovecruft, who uses nonbinary pronouns, claimed in 2019 that Todd sexually harassed them and grabbed their arm, which he denied. After he sued Lovecruft for defamation, two anonymous women detailed accounts of sexual assault by Todd in court filings. On July 15, 2019, Lovecruft filed an anti-SLAPP motion, asking the court to dismiss Todd’s lawsuit as an attempt to curtail free speech.      On Tuesday, without deleting the original tweet, Lovecruft also tweeted, “Peter Todd never raped or sexually assaulted me.” Lovecruft’s GoFundMe page says this tweet was required as part of the settlement. Todd cited hefty legal fees as his primary reason for settling the case, which he initially filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Oakland, in April 2019.      “I settled because I ran out of money. I’d rather have kept the case [going]. But the really important thing was to turn vague allegations – which were surprisingly harmful – into something I could actually respond to,” Todd told CoinDesk. “Isis has been making vague claims.”      Lovecruft used GoFundMe to crowdsource roughly $35,800 for legal fees. They also accepted cryptocurrency donations, including bitcoin, monero and several others. Lovecruft’s crowdfunding page offers an ambiguous statement:    “The basic terms of the settlement are: Todd agreed to dismiss his lawsuit against Lovecruft, and walk away without any financial recovery, in exchange for a statement by Lovecruft clarifying that they do not assert (as they have never asserted) that Todd raped or sexually assaulted them personally.""    This would relate to the claim of arm-grabbing, not the sexual assault allegations by the two anonymous accusers, both identified in court papers as “Jane Doe.” In a statement to CoinDesk, Todd said Lovecruft and one male witness had a conflict of interest because both were involved in the Zcash project, which Todd often criticizes.      One of the Jane Does made a filing in the case in support of Lovecruft, claiming Todd raped her. The second Jane Doe, referred to in filings although she did not make a filing herself, alleged in an interview with CoinDesk that Todd touched her inappropriately. Todd denied the allegations and contended the alleged rape victim was not ""involved in any Bitcoin projects,"" which he argued undermined the credibility of her account. Both Jane Does, in interviews with CoinDesk, said they used to participate in the broader bitcoin community but stopped after the alleged incidents.      In previous communications with CoinDesk, both alleged victims indicated they wanted to move on with their lives and did not seek to press charges or otherwise publicly discuss the accusations. This legal conflict was entirely between Lovecruft and Todd, the latter of whom claimed the settlement represents a victory. Yet, Lovecruft hasn’t deleted the original tweet, which sparked the lawsuit, and did not respond to requests for comment by press time.      Update (June 17, 17:50 UTC): An earlier version of this article mis-paraphrased the anonymous accusations of sexual assault. Only the alleged rape victim made a filing to support Lovecruft's testimony, the other harassment alleged victim was referenced in a witness testimony but never filed herself. Since Todd does not know the identity of this second Jane Doe, his sole comment on this accusation is denial.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | XMR | ZEC,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/16/ex-bitcoin-dev-settles-defamation-suit-over-sex-assault-claims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65f6288f311fb1a25595947a35218839d8f29882-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404696,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkJBa,1592345736,WisdomTree Proposes ETF With 5% Bitcoin Exposure Despite SEC's Long-Standing Blockade,"WisdomTree Trust is seeking to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in part in the growing bitcoin futures market.      The New York City-based asset manager filed on Tuesday for an ETF that may invest up to 5% of its net assets in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) bitcoin futures contracts, as shown in documents published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      Multiple attempts at launching a pure-bitcoin ETF by different companies in the past have met with failure, as have attempts at launching an ETF that invested in bitcoin and Treasury bonds. In various rejections, the SEC has taken issue with the size of the bitcoin market, the potential it is being manipulated, questions around ensuring custody of bitcoin and a lack of surveillance sharing agreements between a sizable bitcoin market and a regulated exchange.      If approved, the “WisdomTree Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund"" would invest the rest of its net assets in energy, industrial metals, precious metals and agriculture commodities, meaning bitcoin would be only a tiny slice of the total pie.      But it is a telling sign. The market for CME’s cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts has been steadily growing over the last few months. May saw multiple record-setting days for open interest on CME, a spike that coincided with heightened interest in bitcoin futures from institutional investors like Paul Tudor Jones. WisdomTree spokespersons did not respond to CoinDesk requests by press time.      The move casts bitcoin as a perhaps normalized investment opportunity for a fund that more generally seeks exposure to commodity markets at large. Commodity market movements do not directly correlate with indices, though some argue that bitcoin, which is traded as a commodity, follows the market.      WisdomTree is no stranger to cryptocurrencies. Corporate Strategy Director William Peck previously told CoinDesk he views digital assets as a natural extension of the WisdomTree business model. The $63 billion asset manager has explored launching a regulated stablecoin on the U.S. market, and last year issued a bitcoin exchange-traded product on Switzerland’s SIX stock exchange.

42404702,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkJDY,1592342114,"From Australia to Norway, Contact Tracing Is Struggling to Meet Expectations","Researchers in Australia have identified a bug that caused that country’s contact tracing app to malfunction, it was announced Monday.      Governments around the world have introduced contact tracing apps to track the spread of the coronavirus. But, as in Australia, so far it’s unclear how much of a benefit these systems are having. Critics complain about risks to privacy and centralization of sensitive data, and note that intrusive technologies rarely work as expected.      COVIDSafe, Australia’s contact tracing app, was rolled out in April. But its latest version has not been working properly due to a bug, Richard Nelson, a software engineer, announced.      See also: Europe Debates COVID-19 Contact Tracing That Respects Privacy      The bug causes iPhones that are locked to stop creating a new temporary ID, which is a key feature of Bluetooth-based contact tracing. This method uses the Bluetooth signal of other phones to identify with whom you’ve been in close contact. If a person with a phone you’ve come into contact with contracts COVID-19, you will be alerted because your temporary IDs were communicated to each via Bluetooth when you were close.      To protect user privacy, these temporary IDs regularly change. Without the ability to create a new temporary ID, though, a person’s phone will recognize and log other devices around it, but cannot be recognized by other devices, rendering it effectively invisible.      “The bug has a material impact on the number of encounters logged, particularly at an event, say, where people will tend to not have their devices out and in use, for example at a concert or movie theater,” Nelson told CoinDesk. “This is exactly the type of scenario where you’d want the application to be working in an optimal manner.”      In the report, Nelson laid out a scenario in which a woman named Alice packed her bag, put her iPhone in it, and went out for the day to a football (soccer) game. “With her device in this state, nobody else will record her presence, and if anyone around her tested positive she would not be contacted,” he wrote.      Contact tracing is the process by which countries and health departments track with whom an infected person has come into contact so they can let those people know they should quarantine. Apps have been proposed and implemented around the world to aid in this process. The results have been mixed at best.      For example, the state of Utah launched an app called HealthyTogether in an effort to help the state reopen from lockdown. As of late May, the only features available in the app were a symptom checker and testing center map, despite assurances there would also be tools to help human contact tracers, and a maps function that would allow users to determine which areas were at high or low risk in their communities, according to reporting by Buzzfeed News. Today, the New York Attorney General is calling on tech giants Google and Apple to crack down on shady contact tracing apps in their app stores that aren’t transparent about how they’re using or storing user data.    Ironically, an effort to better protect users' privacy is what caused this bug in the first place.    “As businesses open back up and Americans venture outdoors, technology can be an invaluable tool in helping us battle the coronavirus,” said Attorney General Letitia James in the announcement. “But some companies may seek to take advantage of consumers and use personal information to advertise, mine data and unethically profit off this pandemic.”      Meanwhile, Norway has suspended its contact tracing app after its own data protection agency said it was too invasive when it came to user privacy.      Back in Australia, nearly one month after the COVIDSafe app launched, the Guardian reported the app was barely used, and only one person had been reported to have been identified as positive for COVID-19 using data from it.      Ironically, an effort to better protect users' privacy is what caused this bug in the first place, according to one cryptographer.      “The Australian government had recently overhauled the cryptographic protocol for their app, adding encryption to the payload in a way which, when it worked, mostly improved users' privacy,” said Vanessa Teague, a cryptographer with a focus on privacy and election security, and an associate professor at Australian National University.      She has also been researching the app. “Unfortunately, because they seem to have rushed it out without adequate testing or peer review, they seem to have completely broken its operation on iPhones in background mode.”      See also: For Contact Tracing That Preserves Privacy, Focus on Incentives      Steve Wilson, the managing director of Lockstep Group, a consulting firm that focuses on digital identity and privacy, saw the report and said the app has been terribly disappointing in terms of software quality.      “There are some surprising bugs, indicative of poor software processes,” said Wilson. “The app is turning out to be both pretty impotent and innocuous.”      Wilson said he was sad because he’s sympathetic to contact tracing technology as a general proposition, and the app is well intentioned, if a bit clumsy. Wilson said some of the privacy criticisms are overblown when you compare it to the very real impact of the virus, and especially if you don’t consider the government an adversary in the privacy-safety trade-off the world is currently navigating.      “COVIDSafe is nowhere near the worst thing a government has ever done to privacy,” said Wilson.      In a statement to CoinDesk, the Data Transformation Agency (DTA) for Australia said it continues to welcome feedback on COVIDSafe from the developer community, with previous feedback helping us to improve the app.      “The DTA will continue to release updates to the COVIDSafe app to deliver a range of performance, security and accessibility improvements as required,” said a spokesperson for the DTA. “The Australian community can have confidence the app is working securely and effectively.”      Nelson said he had reported the issue to the DTA.      “I’m sure they’ll fix it in a timely manner so, hopefully, going forward the issue is resolved,” said Nelson.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/16/from-australia-to-norway-contact-tracing-is-struggling-to-meet-expectations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51c14d9266c9601362463dafe259a4f75a7442d1-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404707,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkJMP,1592341735,COMP's Sudden Growth Has Swamped a DEX Dealing Only in Stablecoins,"One of the newer entrants to the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, Curve, is riding the wave of demand for the freshly issued Compound governance token, COMP, which has surged to a $774.3 million market cap since first being distributed on Monday.      Curve is an automated market maker devoted exclusively to stablecoins. On Sunday, it saw $3.5 million in daily trading volume, according to its self-reported stats. On Monday that shot up to $12.6 million; as of this writing on Tuesday, it's at $23.3 million in trading volume over the last 24 hours, a roughly 7X gain.      According to Curve founder Michael Egorov (also a co-founder of encryption company NuCypher), this is largely driven by demand for COMP.      ""People started putting USDC as collateral on Compound, taking USDT, swapping on Curve to USDC to put as collateral on Compound [and] doing that up to 30 times to earn COMP with leverage,"" Egorov wrote CoinDesk in an email.      That's because Compound gives the most COMP each day to the markets with the most interest. Right now, among stablecoins, those are USDC and USDT. In other words, users put in USDC, borrow as much USDT as they can, switch it on Curve for more USDC, put that in Compound as well so they can borrow more, take out additional USDT and repeat until they have capped out their leverage. This allows them to absolutely maximize their activity on Compound as both a borrower and lender, which earns COMP on both sides.      Egorov said that many users can actually automate this operation on InstaDapp.      Compound announced its plans for COMP on CoinDesk. On June 10, the company announced that distribution would begin on June 15.      COMP is currently trading at $78.33 as of press time, according to Uniswap.Curve currently has $16.2 million in deposits, down from a high of $17.2 million reached this weekend.

It then climbed 2% to as high as $9,591 before sell volumes pushed bitcoin back down. The price is now above the 50-day moving averages but below the 10-day moving average. For technicians, this signals prices are expected to move sideways for a bit.      Stocks were the real movers on Tuesday. The possibility of another fresh fiscal stimulus proposal in the United States, to the tune of $1 trillion for infrastructure projects like wireless networks and roads, helped fuel an equities rally.

In the past week, the average has been $116 million, a 12% drop, according to data from aggregator Skew.      “I think there's a general loss of interest, mostly due to how volatile the external environment has become on the margin,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “The aggregate open interest across derivatives exchanges is now the same as it was at the beginning of June and implied volatility is hitting cyclical lows.”      Read More: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Makes Biggest Jump in 29 Months      Indeed, after total bitcoin futures open interest on the 11 biggest exchanges spiked to almost $4 billion June 1, it has hovered around $3.5 billion for most of the month.

Robert Farkas, 33, admitted he and co-founders Sohrab Sharma and Raymond Trapani misrepresented Centra Tech’s true purpose as they worked to dupe investors out of more than $25 million, the Justice Department said in a press release.      The three pitched investors on a “Centra Card” crypto debit card purportedly issued by Visa or Mastercard, claimed to have 38 state money transmitter licenses and concocted a CEO who they said attended Harvard to bolster their credibility. Prosecutors said that none of those claims were true.      The three also got influential celebrities including boxer Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled to promote Centra Tech’s initial coin offering (ICO) “Centra Tokens,” which ultimately raised $25 million from unwitting investors, prosecutors said.      (Mayweather and Khaled later settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to disclose their financial ties to Centra Tech. Neither admitted or denied guilt in that settlement and later evaded the civil suit.)      Farkas, Trapani and Sharma’s scheme ran from July through October 2017, but by December 2017 a project investor filed suit alleging that Centra Tech had violated securities laws when it raised over $30 million from the Centra Token ICO.      The SEC followed with an April 2018 lawsuit arguing much the same. It ordered Centra Tech to cease its ICO and alleged in court that the project was a multi-million dollar unregistered securities pumped by celebrity endorsements.      The founders of Centra Tech continued to face a mounting onslaught in the courts. In May 2018 they were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy and the commission of securities and wire fraud in the case that Farkas pleaded guilty to Tuesday.

42404699,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkJFW,1592332954,"In the Wildcat Era of Stablecoins, Commercial Banks Have New Rails to Ride","Chance Barnett is chairman of Jewel, a proposed Bermudian bank providing digital asset banking infrastructure to global businesses. He previously founded Crowdfunder, an equity crowdfunding investment platform. Michael Dowling is chief technology officer at Jewel and was the chief technology officer at IBM in its Blockchain Financial Services Group.      The U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin market has grown nearly 100% since January, jumping from roughly $5.5 billion in January to more than $11 billion in June (chart). But with demand for USD fiat-backed stablecoins experiencing tremendous growth, we think it will soon become clear that not all stablecoins are created equal and not all USD vehicles play the same role in pushing the industry forward.      Now, what’s this about wildcats? Well, many of the stablecoins of today lack standards and are fairly opaque surrounding what stablecoin holders are actually holding. Stablecoins differ greatly across their reserve backing, who they’re issued by, how they are redeemable, what their underlying legal and business structures and which blockchains they’re issued on. Even the anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements some stablecoins operate under differ.      This creates an environment similar to the “Wildcat Banking” era in the U.S. in the 1800s, also called the ""Free Banking"" era.      See also: Frances Coppola - The Stablecoin Surge Is Built on Smoke and Mirrors      From 1837 to 1863, many new, small U.S. banks were chartered under state regulators, largely free from federal regulation. These “wildcat banks” printed their own versions of the U.S. dollar (bank notes), which were often only redeemable at intentionally remote bank locations to make them hard to exchange for traditional and federal dollar notes, or could be traded for other notes or goods at discounts to face value.      The wildcatters had a solid run, but in response to some of the negative effects of wildcat banking involving redeemability and price variation, the U.S. government eventually stepped in with the National Bank Act of 1863. This put an end to wildcat bank notes and standardized the U.S. dollar notes by asserting the U.S. government’s monopoly on printing the U.S. currency.      And yet, we hadn’t seen the last of the wildcats.    The wildcat stablecoins today    Today we’re in the Wildcat Banking Era of Stablecoins, with a new cast of proverbial wildcatters issuing their own versions of USD as stablecoins.      Stablecoins are being issued by exchanges, money service businesses (MSB), trust companies and, soon, more banks, making for a complex web of legal structures, reserve backing, regulatory regimes, AML/KYC requirements, contractual rights and obligations, all on different Layer 1 blockchains.      In today’s Wildcat Banking Era of Stablecoins, a dollar is not necessarily a dollar.      The structures for stablecoins today might not always provide the stablecoin holder with rights to underlying fiat USD they might assume they have.      As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) recently said in a paper about Central Bank Digital Currencies with reference to stablecoins, “current electronic retail money [fiat-backed stablecoins] represent a claim on an intermediary, rather than functioning as the digital equivalent of cash.” [emphasis added]      See also: JP Koning - The $10B Stablecoin Industry Has a Fraud Problem It’s Not Addressing      Take Tether's USDT, the largest USD fiat-backed stablecoin by issuance and trading volume, and a favorite among digital currency traders. USDT is issued by an MBS. Holders of USDT have a claim with Tether, although Tether does not hold USD funds in custody itself. Therefore, a USDT holder has no direct claim on underlying USD funds.      We call this the Tri-Party Model for stablecoin issuance. In the Tri-Party Model, a finance-focused technology company (the “issuer,” which is often a licensed MSB non-bank financial institution) partners with a financial institution as custodian (typically a trust, custodian or chartered bank) to accept deposits of fiat on behalf of the issuer and collects funds from the issuers’ users.      In exchange, stablecoins are issued representing a 1:1 claim on the deposits held at the separate custodial financial institution, with a consumer-level promise to redeem the fiat dollars held on deposit upon presentation (and burn) of the stablecoins issued.      This arrangement is safer today in terms of preservation of collateral held in custody than, say, algorithmic stablecoins such as dai, which focus on market forces to maintain a value peg (though algorithmic types may serve specific “DeFi” use cases).      There are hidden risks in the Tri-Party Model as well. These exist within the relationships between a regulated financial institution as the issuer of the stablecoin, the original depositor, the custodian of funds and the current legal recourse options for a stablecoin holder in case the issuer declares bankruptcy, as a deposit agreement is extended to the original depositor (the “issuer”) and its creditors before stablecoin holders.      It’s important to note that this hasn’t yet, and may not necessarily, play out as a critical shortcoming today within crypto trading. But as stablecoins move beyond trading and into broader use for payment and settlement, better and more sophisticated structures for stablecoins need to evolve.    Regulators put stablecoin wildcats on notice  On April 14, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) issued a lengthy review, ""Addressing the regulatory, supervisory and oversight challenges raised by ‘global stablecoin’ arrangements.” ( PDF reporthttps://cryptobriefing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/financial-stability-board-addressing-regulatory-supervisory-oversight-challenges-globals-stablecoin-arrangements-pdf.pdf) of the current stablecoins landscape that outlined specific areas of concerns and provided a call for global regulatory review and changes.    This follows the FSB’s prior release ""Regulatory issues of stablecoins” (PDF report), which was drafted in response to the G-20’s concerns about stablecoins.    The structures for stablecoins today might not always provide the stablecoin holder with rights to underlying fiat USD they might assume that they have.    The punchline here is, global regulatory and rule-making bodies are making clear statements about their stablecoin concerns and have a growing focus to address them through further regulation and guidance.      Global regulatory changes of this scope would shake up the current stablecoin market by forcing changes in the current stablecoin structures as a result of new regulations to follow, which likely won’t be fully in favor of the “small guys” and digital currency innovators, namely exchanges and MSBs that have provided the innovation and growth of stablecoins to date.      Further regulation will, for better or worse, likely tip the balance of power towards a stronger role for larger and more heavily regulated structures including trust companies and regulated banks, and eventually central banks (which also are looking to be underlying issuers of fiat-backed central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, themselves).    Banks and central bank digital currencies    Banks and central banks will soon enter the market and enable new models and capabilities of fiat-backed digital assets as bank-issued stablecoins and CBDCs. These models will represent a structural disintermediation of today’s Tri-Party Model stablecoins, where the issuer and custodian holding reserves are one and the same.      This will provide for a more direct model and structure for stablecoin issuance, with issuance tied directly to deposits/reserves held at a single party. This will also provide stablecoin holders with a direct claim on deposits, not on an intermediary.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      What’s more, these stablecoins/CBDCs will have advantages in the market as true cash equivalents, and will tie directly to bank accounts and enable real-time settlement to the bank account level, creating a seamless flow in and out of existing fiat rails.      This combination of factors, as well as bank and central bank acceptance of stablecoins/CBDCs, are likely to drive broader stablecoin utility in payments and settlement, beyond the trading stablecoin use cases of today.    Cooperate or compete?    But with banks and central banks making fiat-backed issuances of their own, will banks and central banks cooperate or compete?      The traditional role of central banks has been monetary policy and to provide for the control and management of the money supply within and among other banks and central banks, operationalized through commercial banks who service corporate and retail customers directly.      In recent times, central banks have discussed and implemented limited scope projects for direct issuance of M0 money as stablecoins tied directly to accounts at a central bank. With this kind of CBDC, business and retail customers would have the ability to open accounts and transact directly with money from central banks and enjoy some of the access to credit and cheap money that Wall St. has had access to for decades.      Central banks could possibly bypass commercial banks and allow for business and retail customers to directly open accounts and “bank” with central banks via CBDCs.      See also: Alex Lipton - Stablecoins Are the Bridge From Central Banks to Consumer Payments      However, most central banks today are not unprepared for this. They likely do not see it as their role to take on the larger technical and operational roles beyond issuance and accounts.      It’s more likely that while central banks in some jurisdiction may provide for direct issuance and accounts, commercial banks will continue providing technology, servicing and credit and lending functions atop the money supply, but sit on a new set of DLT-based rails (CBDC rails).      In this case, digital asset-enabled banks already in the market will be early and well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity with both stablecoins and CBDCs on their ledgers. As such, rather than assume that commercial banks will retain their long-standing roles in a new CBDC paradigm, CBDC will encourage commercial banks to migrate to a new set of rails.      For banks that are early to embrace this change and provide a new set of core banking services facilitated on DLT rails, we believe this will accelerate new and improved models for payment and settlement with stablecoins and CDBDs.",NEUTRAL,USDT,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT,"Chance Barnett, Michael Dowling",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/16/in-the-wildcat-era-of-stablecoins-commercial-banks-have-new-rails-to-ride,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88ae7029a39a943cbf650cee70b69b8021d08240-1300x963.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404700,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkJGV,1592330712,Ethereum Logged Its Busiest Week on Record,"It’s costing more to use Ethereum and that may be because more users are flocking to the platform than ever before, according to one key on-chain metric. Analysts say the growth of both transactions and the cost to process them is being driven by an increase in stablecoin usage and DeFi applications.      The seven-day moving average of the total amount of “gas” used in transactions on Ethereum’s blockchain rose to a record high of 61.12 billion on Monday, having surpassed the previous high of 60.07 billion reached in September 2019, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm CoinMetrics.      Gas is a token that powers Ethereum’s blockchain. It is the unit used to calculate the amount of fees a user needs to pay in order to transfer smart contract data or payments on Ethereum's blockchain. Meanwhile, ether is the reward paid to miners and is equivalent to the amount of gas needed to execute a transaction.      Read more: Stablecoins Push Ethereum’s Transaction Count to Highest Since July 2019      “The increase in gas usage indicates a continuous growth in the use of Ethereum’s platform, as measured by the number of transactions, as well as demand for block space, as measured via gas per transaction,” said Wilson Withiam, research analyst at data provider Messari.      Ethereum’s transaction count recently hit a 27-month high of 938,265 and was up nearly 45% from lows seen in January as of Monday, according to Glassnode.    Tether and DeFi fuel growth    “As both tether and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on Ethereum have exhibited phenomenal growth, Ethereum gas usage has skyrocketed to all-time highs,” Kyle Davies, co-founder and chairman at Three Arrows Capital.      Indeed, the use of the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin tether (USDT) on Ethereum has increased sharply this year.      The number of daily USDT transactions on Ethereum have surged by 450% on a year-to-date basis, as per CoinMetrics.      Tether has been issued on Ethereum since November 2017 and the platform now holds 65% of tether’s total supply. “Almost $6 billion of USDT’s total supply is now on Ethereum, up from $1.5 billion in the beginning of 2020,” Bendik Norheim Schei, research analyst at Arcane Research, told CoinDesk.      Further, tether has 10 times more transactions on Ethereum than any other ERC-20 token. Meanwhile, as per Ether Gas Station, tether transactions have paid over $2.5 million worth of fees on Ethereum in the last 30 days. That makes USDT the largest “gas payer” on Ethereum.

Total supply of all stablecoins has surpassed the $11 billion mark this week, doubling its value since February, according to Messari data.      Even so, the increase in the gas usage is not entirely due to tether. Ethereum-based Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) such as Kyber, Uniswap and IDEX have all experienced solid growth in transaction volumes this year.      Kyber Network registered a transaction volume of $609 million in the first five months of this year. That's 1.5 times more than the volume of $388 million seen in 2019, according to the official blog.    Network congestion    “Another factor responsible for the increase in gas usage may be people gaming the network by paying more in gas fees in order to beat other transactions into a block to gain profit,” said Connor Abendschein, analyst at Digital Assets Data.      Miners prioritize transactions offering higher fees when the network faces congestion; that is, the number of transactions waiting to get confirmed by miners rises to high levels. That forces other users to offer higher fees.      Ethereum’s network has been facing congestion since early March, possibly due to increased price volatility and the surge in tether transactions. As of June 8, there were 19,922,385 unconfirmed transactions - up 225% from the March 1 tally of 611,872, according to blockchain data company Amberdata.      Validating the argument that network congestion could have led to increased gas usage is the fact that gas fees in general have been higher this year. “Gas per transaction recently reached its highest level since early 2018,” Messari’s Withiam noted.

Also, more transactions could be coming from complex DeFi products, which involve higher computational expenses and therefore require bigger gas payments. “People are either paying more expensive computations or willingly paying more to beat other transactions,” said Abendschein.      Looking forward, the usage is likely to continue rising ahead of Ethereum’s much-anticipated switch from the proof-of-work mechanism to the proof-of-stake protocol. “Scalability on Ethereum will continue to be tested as we head into Phase 0 Eth 2.0 and beyond,” said Three Arrow Capital’s Davis.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | KNC | USDT | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/16/ethereum-logged-its-busiest-week-on-record,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a20864500de8dc13f50961cf345c86ffb757b81-2840x1832.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Revealing its plans in a June 11 job posting, the central bank said it was “reinventing central banking” and radically rethinking the nature of Canada’s cash.  “The Bank of Canada is embarking on a program of major social significance to design a contingent system for a CBDC, which can be thought of as a banknote, but in digital form,” the bank wrote.  CoinDesk’s request for comment was not returned by press time.  Still, the job posting said as much about the new role – CBDC Project Manager – as it did about the project itself, going into detail on some of the features of a digital banknote.  According to the job posting, Canada’s CBDC should protect user privacy (though not to the degree that cash does), remain accessible to those without bank accounts or mobile phones, work when the power is out and rival banknotes in their security, so as to gain confidence among the cash-wielding public.  Read more: ‘Anonymity Vouchers’ Could Bring Limited Privacy to CBDCs: ECB Report  Further, the bank wants its CBDC to live on an architecture “with a potentially multi-decade evolving lifespan” that can grow in tandem with policy goals.  Other technical details remain undetermined, however. The bank did not state what technology its CBDC might run on, whether it would follow a token-based or account-based model, or how it could create a digital currency that works where electricity does not.  Those details will take shape over the project manager’s three-year tenure. During that time, the bank also wants to build out a “CBDC pilot system.”  The move casts Canada as a serious contender in the race to develop CBDCs. Many nations have begun mulling the issue of national digital currencies and some, including China, appear to be on the verge of issuing their own. But only a handful have actualized their findings to the extent that the Bank of Canada is doing now.  To be clear, the bank has not committed to issuing a CBDC just yet. Officials downplayed the need for one as recently as February, arguing there was no ”compelling case” for a Canadian CBDC unless a private digital currency such as Libra took off.  ""While the Bank is ramping up contingency planning for this eventuality, there is not a compelling case at this time to issue a CBDC,"" a Bank of Canada spokesperson told CoinDesk after publication of this article.

42404695,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkJ8d,1592326948,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Makes Biggest Jump in 29 Months,"Bitcoin has just posted its biggest mining difficulty increase in nearly 2.5 years.      At around 17:00 UTC on Tuesday, the network adjusted its difficulty level – a measure of how hard it is for miners to compete for block rewards on the blockchain – to 15.78 trillion.      The 14.95% rise is the biggest difficulty jump since January 2018, which saw a larger spike on the back of the 2017 crypto market bull run, data compiled by BTC.com shows.      As a result, miners contributing hashing power to the network are now facing the fourth-most difficult two-week mining period in Bitcoin's history.      The latest increase comes after two consecutive declines in difficulty following the network's quadrennial halving event on May 11, 2020, which reduced block rewards from 12.5 bitcoin per block to the current 6.25 bitcoin.      The reduction in block rewards initially forced some miners with inefficient hardware and/or more costly electricity resources to halt operations. That led to a decline in Bitcoin's total hashrate and difficulty until earlier this month.      The difficulty drops on May 20 and June 4, and the sudden reduction in competition, meant that those miners able to continue operating could receive a bigger slice of the pie.      Read more: Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan’s Stock Hits Record Low 1 Month After Halving      However, the lower difficulty also meant that some who had shut down older mining equipment immediately after the halving could once more turn a profit in the past two weeks. Meanwhile, major miner manufacturers in China have been delivering new, top-of-the-line equipment since May.      These factors have pushed up the average 14-day hash rate on Bitcoin from 98 million terahashes per second (TH/s) earlier this month to now around 113 EH/s.    Out with the old?    All that said, the fact that Bitcoin's mining difficulty has quickly bounced back to the pre-halving levels may bring pain for some existing players.      Bitcoin adjusts its mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks, roughly every 14 days, to ensure an average block interval of 10 minutes. When more people choose to plug in during a two-week cycle, the network will see a hash rate increase that will shorten the block interval and will subsequently increase the difficulty for the next cycle.      The current difficulty level of 15.78 trillion follows closely behind the highest three figures ever of 16.55, 16.1 and 15.95 trillion, respectively – all recorded in the two months prior the halving. In other words, miners are facing competitiveness close to that seen prior to the halving, but the daily block subsidies are now down from 1,800 bitcoin to 900.      As a result, each TH/s of computing power is now generating around 0.000008 bitcoin in 24 hours, worth around $0.08 at bitcoin's current price.      ""With the value of hashrate set to decrease to $0.075 cents per TH/s, not many of the existing, old-gen equipment will turn back on,"" said Ethan Vera, co-founder and CFO of the Luxor mining pool. ""New hashrate coming onto the market will likely be driven by new-gen and high-efficiency machines.""      Kevin Zhang, director of blockchain strategies at New York-based bitcoin mining-power plant hybrid Greenidge Generation, offered a similar view, saying the firm's strategy is to stay competitive by procuring and running the latest-generation equipment.      ""Despite limited price action, we expect the hash rate to continue rising in the near term as more older generation miners go offline and newer generation ones come online,"" he said.      As a comparison, the most recent mining devices, like Bitmain's AntMiner S19, can deliver computing power that's nearly 10 times that of an older model like the AntMiner S9, but only consumes two times more power.      Read more: Bitmain’s Power Struggle Takes Toll on Customers as Co-Founder Halts Shipments      An on-going power struggle at Bitmain, the world's largest bitcoin miner maker, will most likely cause delays to delivery of new mining equipment, said Vera, though he thinks the network's hashrate could still reach 140 million TH/s by the year's end.      ""This is roughly in line with what the market is pricing in for FTX's Q4 2020 Difficulty Futures,"" Vera said.      Crypto derivative exchange FTX rolled out a bitcoin difficulty quarterly futures trading pair last month. Currently, the 2020 Q3 and Q4 futures are trading at around $18, reflecting an expectation that the average hash rate and mining difficulty could further go up by another 20% in the second half of the year.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/16/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-makes-biggest-jump-in-29-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1a22e07402bcacad96ad3967e02c66cad61c7c1-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Lightning Network Explorer, there are eight nodes total in the second most populous continent. Meanwhile, WhatsApp rolled out a Facebook Pay feature in Brazil, two years after it beta tested the feature in India, which makes sending and receiving money “as easy as sharing photos.” It’s unknown how this will affect the development of Libra, the stablecoin also bolstered by Facebook.

Meanwhile, shares of Canaan Creative, one of the few publicly traded crypto miner manufacturers, plummeted below $2, its lowest price since going public in November. The Nasdaq-listed stock has been steadily falling since the bitcoin halving on May 11, which likely softened demand for new bitcoin mining machines.

This law bars “accessing a computer without authorization.” A broad or narrow interpretation could criminalize common conduct or lead to increased protections for crypto users in cases of insider theft. “The outcome could have big implications for the cryptocurrency industry, which increasingly relies on legally enforceable privacy rights and the power of the law to ensure that intermediaries properly secure their customer’s digital assets,” Hinkes said.    Market intel    Going Negative Could Be Positive Whether or not the Federal Reserve eventually cuts interest rates to negative levels, it might be a case of heads, bitcoin wins; tails, bitcoin wins. Cryptocurrency analysts have said negative rates are a form of ultra-loose monetary policy, which should push inflation higher, potentially catalyzing interest in bitcoin, seen as an inflation hedge. But bitcoin might trade higher even if the Fed rejects negative rates outright because the U.S. central bank would instead probably just inject trillions more of freshly-created dollars into the financial system.

42404694,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkJAb,1592326071,Venezuela Is a Testing Ground for Digital Dollarization (and Zelle Doesn't Like It),"J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      Dollarization isn't what it used to be.      When a local currency – lira, pesos, kwacha or whatnot – gets replaced by a foreign currency (almost always the U.S. dollar) the issuing nation is said to have dollarized. U.S. paper currency was once the main vehicle for dollarization.      But Venezuela, the most recent nation to undergo dollarization, has updated this framework. In addition to adopting U.S. paper currency, Venezuelans have found a novel way to digitally dollarize. Unfortunately, the providers of these digital dollars – U.S.-based Zelle and the banks that offer it – don’t seem terribly happy about this state of affairs.      See also: Nic Carter - Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status      Most dollarizations have followed a script that begins with a hyperinflation of the local currency. Locals desperately turn to the ubiquitous U.S. paper dollar as a way to save, express prices and make payments.      Paper dollars don't start circulating immediately. They have to be imported. People stuff them into their suitcases when they fly in from the U.S. Others sneak bills over the border in trucks. The subterfuge is necessary to evade exchange controls, which local authorities often impose in a last-ditch way to stop hyperinflation. But these blockades don't really work. The dollars seep in anyways.    Venezuelans don't just want to paper dollarize; they want to digitally dollarize.    Eventually, enough paper dollars get imported into the economy that the local currency is displaced. And, voila, dollarization! This happened in Ecuador in 2000 and in Zimbabwe in 2008. It came close to happening in Argentina in the 1990s. And it is happening now in Venezuela. Venezuelan bolivars, which are losing value at a rate of around 2000%-3000% per year, are being progressively bodied out by U.S. dollars.      Venezuela's experience is different from previous dollarizations, however. Your grandfather's dollarization – the ones that occurred in the 1990s and 2000s – pivoted around paper currency. Venezuelans have become much more tech savvy over the last decades. Cash isn’t as useful as it used to be. Venezuelans don't just want to paper dollarize; they want to digitally dollarize.    Enter VeneZelle    There's a big impediment to digital dollarization in places like Venezuela. The U.S. Federal Reserve doesn't issue a digital version of the U.S. dollar.      So, Venezuelans have cobbled an innovative way to digitally dollarize. They are using Zelle, a U.S.-based payments network run by Arizona-based Early Warning Services, to conduct Venezuelan commerce. Early Warning is owned by Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.      Operating since 2016, Zelle allows anyone with a U.S. bank account to instantly transfer funds to another U.S. bank account for free. It competes with person-to-person payments apps including Square Cash and Venmo. Zelle processed $187 billion in payments in 2019, up 57% from $119 billion in 2018.      Although Zelle is meant for U.S. usage only, Venezuelans have repurposed the network as a way to make dollar payments among each other. Large Venezuelan supermarket chains including Excelsior Gama, Automercados Plaza's, Unicasa and Central Madeirense have enabled Zelle as a form of payment. Cafes and restaurants accept it. So do taxis.      “Zeya acepto,” or Zelle accepted (Twitter)      Access to U.S. bank accounts is fairly common in Venezuela. Many Venezuelans students have Zelle-linked U.S. bank accounts, which they continue to use when they return home. A large expatriate community in the U.S. provides family and friends back in Venezuela with Zelle access.      Ecoanalítica, a macroeconomic analysis company, recently tracked over 15,000 transactions in 10 different Venezuelan cities including Caracas, San Cristóbal and Puerto Ordaz. Around 56% of these transactions were conducted in U.S. dollars. According to Asdrúbal Oliveros, an economist at Ecoanalitica, 12% of all transactions were processed by Zelle. Those are impressive statistics. The fact that Zelle payments are free has no doubt promoted usage.      But much of this activity infringes on Zelle’s terms of service. Zelle specifies that its network is ""intended for personal, not business or commercial use."" This means it's okay to use Zelle to split up restaurant bills with friends or send $200 to your daughter to buy university books. But it's prohibited for grocery chains or taxi companies to accept Zelle payments.      This contradiction between Zelle's stated purpose and the role to which Venezuelans have drafted it, came to a head last week. Wells Fargo, a large U.S. bank, notified many Venezeulan account holders their connection to Zelle was to be terminated. Venezuelans quickly took to Twitter:      Before long the suspensions made national news. According to some media reports, Wells Fargo suspended service because usage was ""not consistent"" with its intended use. Venezuelans like Oliveros worry that other U.S. banks will follow Wells Fargo’s lead. If so, this would put an end to VeneZelle.    Digital dollar alternatives    For now, Zelle still works for many Venezuelans. But if access were to be entirely cut off, what other routes might be available to digital dollarization?      One option is for local banks to cobble together their own U.S. dollar digital payments systems. This seems to be happening already. According to Reuters, cash-heavy businesses like grocery stores have started to keep U.S. banknotes in custody at Venezuelan banks. These banks let their customers make U.S. dollar cash transfers to other bank customers. Because cash is expensive to store and handle, this nascent dollar system is terribly expensive to operate. Banks charge 1%-2% a month for this service. Transferring cash to another customer costs 1% of the amount.    U.S. dollar stablecoins like Tether, Paxos, or USD Coin could be recruited by nations suffering from hyperinflation.    If Venezuelan banks could send banknotes back to their U.S. bankers and hold a dollar deposit instead, the system would be much more efficient. The Panamanian payment system – which is dollarized, too – functions on these lines. However, U.S. sanctions prevent Venezuelan banks from keeping accounts at U.S. banks.      A number of commentators want the Federal Reserve (“the Fed”) to create a digital form of the dollar. This could be Fedcoin, a digital version of U.S. paper cash, or FedAccounts, an account at the Fed that anyone could open. Both options would help people fleeing hyperinflation to digitally dollarize. Neither seems unlikely, however, since the Fed is worried that issuing a digital form of the dollar could hurt the U.S. banking system.      Which means that for now, private enterprise will probably have to act as the vehicle for digital dollarization in places like Venezuela.      See also: Stablecoin Supply Breaks $10B as Traders Demand Dollars Over Bitcoin      In the future, U.S. dollar stablecoins such as tether, paxos, or USD coin could be recruited by nations suffering from hyperinflation. Over the last few months, there has been a big jump in the number of stablecoins issued. Unlike Zelle, these privately issued blockchain-based versions of the U.S. dollar do not put many limitations on usage. Anyone can open a wallet and receive or transmit these tokens. And, unlike bitcoin, which never really attracted much usage in Venezuela, a stablecoin doesn’t suffer from white-knuckle price fluctuations. (Bitcoin could still be part of the story. Colombia-based startup Valiu plans to offer bitcoin-backed, synthetic dollar savings accounts, for instance.)      Or, maybe ad-hoc patchwork efforts like VeneZelle will continue to be the preferred route to digital dollarization. They are awkward and not very legal, but these creative workarounds seem to have captured Venezuelans’ attention – at least as long as Zelle and its bank owners allow it.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/16/venezuela-is-a-testing-ground-for-digital-dollarization-and-zelle-doesnt-like-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90c74e42c0c52cff785d528c7bc59ee79018c5fc-1300x867.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We’ve come a long way from the days when we analyzed every “cryptocurrency” using MV=PQ, a monetarist theory whereby if supply of money increases, economic activity will increase (where M is the money supply, V is the velocity, P is the price of goods and services and Q is the quantity of goods and services).      Today’s digital assets universe is similar to the fixed-income market. Most people understand the basic concept of debt and can explain what a bond is, yet the “Handbook of Fixed Income Securities” written by Frank Fabozzi is over 1,300 pages long! Clearly, there is more to the bond market than just coupon payments and principal repayment. This “fixed-income bible” is required reading for anyone who begins their fixed-income journey.      The book discusses bonds with different maturities, different coupons and different covenants. It discusses different issuer types (government, municipal, investment grade, high-yield, distressed, asset-backed, etc.) and distinguishes between bond features (callable, put-able, convertible, sinkers, bonds with warrants, etc.). It discusses important valuation concepts such as duration and convexity and introduces “bond math” and recovery values. Clearly a “one size fits all” investment framework would not be prudent for such a complex topic.    Over time, as with fixed income, digital asset participants will begin to specialize.    Similarly, the digital assets ecosystem has evolved from the early days of simple homogenous “currencies” to an ecosystem now worthy of its own long explanatory handbook. We can now invest in, and utilize, digital assets issued by faceless entities, decentralized projects, digital asset corporations, traditional non-crypto companies, individuals and soon-to-be governments. The investment vehicles consist of SAFTs, private tokens, public tokens, DAOs, and digital debt and equity instruments. We have tokenized time, predictions, basket tokens and NFTs. Some digital assets are true utility tokens meant for a targeted use case on a specific platform. Others are quasi-equity/quasi-utility tokens with amortizing features, dividends or buyback/burn mechanisms. And, of course, we’ll eventually need a whole chapter dedicated to security tokens, which one day will look more like straightforward financial instruments.      Analyzing value accrual for these digital assets requires blending traditional finance valuation techniques (like a P/E ratio) with token design mechanisms intended to drive active network participation. For example, the growth in the total value locked (TVL) for DeFi tokens (up tenfold to $1 billion in a little over a year) demonstrates that using high staking rewards (inflation) to reduce velocity and float has the potential to create a long bias for holders and increases the costs of borrowing, making it hard to short the token. In addition to inflationary rewards, these early adopters are providing collateral to the staking pool and earning yield based on the transaction fees the platform is generating, which once again, lends itself to traditional cash flow analysis.      We’ve barely scratched the surface, and we’d probably already be on page 100.      See also: Jeff Dorman - What I Learned the First Time I Lost a Million Dollars      There are a myriad of issues holding established investors back from entering the digital assets space, but using a proper narrative and setting more realistic expectations can help investors better understand how to view and analyze this new asset class. Over time, as with fixed-income, digital asset participants will begin to specialize. Investors with certain unique skill sets and investment goals will begin to focus on the subsets of the market that appeals most to them, or best fits their goals.      The digital assets space is new, different and still largely misunderstood. But so are all new asset classes and products when they are introduced. From high-yield bonds to credit default swaps to exchange-traded funds, each new financial product started out slowly before becoming widely understood, investable products. Don’t be surprised if a large broker-dealer one day has separate floors for mining/staking, trading NFTs [non-fungible tokens] and underwriting security tokens.      And I’d expect a very thick book (most likely in digital form) to be required reading before anyone is allowed on the floor.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Dorman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/16/if-crypto-is-anything-like-fixed-income-its-going-to-need-a-fatter-textbook,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/826cad53d7d4ddc1911b52f4fcc5c8866fd5b56c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432087,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9hbh,1592316000,ConsenSys Spins Up Staking Service in Anticipation of Ethereum 2.0,"Ethereum development house ConsenSys is being backed by heavy hitters like Binance and Huobi to test its new “staking-as-a-service” offering, designed to make it easy for institutions to earn income from the next iteration of the second-largest public blockchain.      Announced Tuesday, the Eth 2.0 staking pilot from ConsenSys Codefi includes Binance, Huobi Wallet, Matrixport, Crypto.com, DARMA Capital and Trustology.      This first batch of participants will provide feedback and feature requests to Codefi as it builds out its Eth 2.0 staking API, which is targeted at large exchanges, wallet providers, custodians and crypto hedge funds. Existing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains such as Tezos, Cosmos and Algorand won’t be supported.      However, as this year’s official starting point for the transition to Eth 2.0 nears, there has been interest in staking from across the board, said Tim Lowe, the product manager of Codefi Staking.      “We have also been talking to some of the newer banks, the kind of challenger banks in the space, and they are definitely interested,” said Lowe. “I think anybody who is holding any crypto assets and is aware of Ethereum generally is starting to look at Eth 2.0 and staking. It’s still early but the interest is there across the board.”      Read more: ConsenSys Announces Codefi Project to Boost DeFi Adoption      Ethereum’s gradual upgrade to Eth 2.0 moves the network from its more energy-hungry Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to PoS, a method of locking-in cryptocurrency in order to keep the network afloat. The upgrade also aims to shard the blockchain and massively scale up its transaction volume capabilities.      This gradual process, starting with an intermediate beacon chain, will result in two parallel chains – the existing Eth 1.x and Eth 2.0 – which will finally be merged together about two years from now.      Typically, the sort of feedback Codefi expects from the staking pilot participants will include variations around API integration, how to custody Eth 2.0 withdrawal keys, or preferences for a rewards-based fee or a flat fee based on the amount staked, said Lowe.      “With staking on Binance, users can receive staking rewards without needing to set up nodes, or worrying about minimum staking amounts, time lengths or any catches,” Binance CEO “CZ” Changpeng Zhao said in a statement. “Users deserve the rewards that their coins can earn them. With the eventual launch of Ethereum 2.0, we are excited to support staking for all of our ETH holders on Binance.”    Staking competition    Mirko Schmiedl, founder and CEO of Staking Rewards (a kind of CoinMarketCap for staking and DeFi), welcomed professional white-label solutions that exchanges and custodians can adopt and said the ConsenSys offerings seem to be open for everyone.      There are benefits and drawbacks when it comes to staking by exchanges and custodians, said Schmiedl.      “An exchange can allow trading of staked assets and effectively remove the impact of lock-up periods for their users through efficient liquidity management,” Schmiedl said. “Exchanges can also allow usage of staked assets as collateral for other applications as long as they happen within the confines of the exchanges. This could include things like margin trading, lending and supplying collateral for derivative trading. An exchange can also offer insurance for slashing events with relative ease.”      On the other hand, when users stake through a custodial entity, they delegate control over all rights associated with the asset, and there is always the risk that a large-scale hack could happen to an exchange.      “Even if the entity is regulated and instituted schemes that enable greater decentralization, for example, by enabling customers to choose validators they are staking with, the entity ultimately is in control and theoretically able to change rules or to abuse its power,” said Schmiedl.      Read more: Why Crypto Should Care About Justin Sun’s Steem Drama      Another downside is that assets on such a custodial platform will largely be limited to using that platform’s services. “It’s not possible to store a staked asset on Binance and then use it as collateral in BlockFi or Maker to take out a loan, for example. This dynamic might lead to increasing concentration among exchanges and reinforce the network effects of large exchanges,” added Schmiedl.      As such, a number of non-custodial staking solutions are emerging such as Stakewise, Rocketpool and StakerDAO. Meanwhile, solutions are becoming more sophisticated with the likes of Staked offering a kind of “robo advisor” for staking tokens on PoS networks such as Tezos.      Codefi Staking was built using Teku, an Eth 2.0 client written in Java by PegaSys, a Consensys engineering team with a sharp focus on enterprise (the PegaSys team are also behind the Besu enterprise client, which joined Hyperldger earlier this year).      “We chose Java because it’s just easy for enterprises and not scary for them to adopt,“ said PegaSys researcher Ben Edgington. “The licensing is liberal Apache 2, which is easy for the enterprise to adopt. We also offer SLA [service-level agreement] support to respond swiftly to incidents.”      Read more: Staked Automates the Best DeFi Returns With Launch of Robo Advisor      It will be possible to start earning staking rewards on the Ethereum beacon chain in the latter half of this year, said Edgington, but you won’t get access to those rewards until the eventual merger of 1.x and 2.0.      Lowe explained Codefi has yet to finalize what sort of cut it will take from institutions for supplying them with the necessary infrastructure and hand-holding to set up a staking operation.      “We hope over the coming weeks that we will finalize exactly what the infrastructure costs are going to be and from that work out the fees off the back of it,” said Lowe. “From a staking point of view, we are not going to be the cheapest, but we’re also not going to be the most expensive.”      To say ConsenSys is invested in Ethereum is an understatement. But as Lowe pointed out, the whole point of the yearslong move to PoS is the democratization of mining.      “The goal is to lower the barrier of entry and [countering] these kinds of centralization pressures whereby only people who can afford to put up a massive data farm somewhere with cheap power and cheap cooling can participate,” he said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/16/consensys-spins-up-staking-service-in-anticipation-of-ethereum-20,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/534a22ef7f01f98bab05983b69800f8f119b170c-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432103,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9i7h,1592309998,Bitcoin Rises to $9.6K as Stocks Cheer Additional US Stimulus Plans,"Bitcoin clocked highs near $9,600 Tuesday morning, having trapped bears on the wrong side of the market with a brief dip below $9,000 on Monday.      Analysts say a risk reset in the traditional markets fueled bitcoin’s rise from $8,900 to $9,580 in the last 24 hours. “Bitcoin has regained poise, possibly tracking the recovery in global stock markets,” said Asim Ahmad, co-chief investment officer at London-based Eterna Capital.      Major European equity markets are reporting gains of over 2% at press time, while futures tied to the S&P 500 are up 1.2%, according to Investing.com. The situation was different 24 hours ago when S&P 500 futures were down 2% due to renewed fears over the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.    Sentiment on Wall Street turned positive during yesterday's U.S. trading hours after the Federal Reserve announced it would start buying yet more corporate bonds. The S&P 500 ended the day with a 0.83% gain. The risk appetite improved further during Tuesday’s Asian hours after Bloomberg reportedhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-team-weighs-1-trillion-023458531.html the Trump administration is preparing a near $1 trillion infrastructure proposal.    The turnaround in the global equities likely helped bitcoin rise back to $9,600. In the past, the cryptocurrency has closely followed traditional markets during bouts of coronavirus-induced panic.      Most notably, the cryptocurrency crashed from $10,000 to $3,867 in the first half of March, as stock markets cratered at the prospect of a coronavirus-induced recession. In the following five weeks, both stocks and bitcoin witnessed solid recovery rallies.      See also: First Mover: Negative Rates or More Money Printing – Bitcoin May Benefit Either Way      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,550, representing a 1% gain on the day. While the unprecedented stimulus programs are widely expected to bode well for bitcoin in the long run, in the short-run, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to losses in stock markets.      Prices may fall again fall back to $9,000 in the next 24 hours if the stock markets lead the way lower. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to present a dour outlook on the economy during his semi-annual policy report on Tuesday and Wednesday.      The Fed said last Wednesday the economy would take years to normalize, dashing hopes for a V-shaped recovery.      From a technical analysis perspective, a clear break above $10,000 is needed to confirm a bullish breakout. The bulls have persistently failed to keep gains above that level over the past three months.      ""Bitcoin has been flirting with the $10,000 mark since May but has since been coming back down,"" said Vijay Ayyar, Asia head at cryptocurrency exchange Luno. ""This is what is typically known as 'distribution', where a lot of the gains made in the past few months by large traders are sold into weaker hands.""      The psychological $10,000 barrier, however, may soon be breached as larger investors seem to be accumulating bitcoin.      As of Monday, there were 2,151 addresses with balance more than 1,000 BTC, the highest since mid-March, according to data from Glassnode. The so-called bitcoin ""rich list"" has increased by nearly 3% over the past two months.      A convincing move above $10,000 would likely yield a stronger rally to resistance lined up at $11,950 (September 2019 high). Meanwhile, on the downside, $8,500 is a key support. ""If that level is breached, prices could decline to the levels we saw in the crash in March: $7,700, and then $7,100,"" said Ayyar.

42432105,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9i9h,1592308856,First Mover: Negative Rates or More Money Printing – Bitcoin May Benefit Either Way,"Whether or not the Federal Reserve eventually cuts interest rates to negative levels, it might be a case of heads: bitcoin wins, tails: bitcoin wins.      So far this year, the Fed has created about $3 trillion of new money, an amount equivalent to more than 70% of the total assets created since its founding in 1913. The question now is what the Fed will do next if the economy fails to recover quickly from the devastation of the coronavirus and markets enter a new tailspin.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      One strategy Fed officials led by Chair Jerome Powell say they won’t pursue? Cutting benchmark interest rates below zero. In a summary of economic projections published by the Fed last week, not a single official projected negative rates.      Cryptocurrency analysts have said negative rates are merely a form of ultra-loose monetary policy, which should eventually push inflation higher. That could be a catalyst for higher prices for bitcoin, seen as a hedge against inflation similar to gold.  But bitcoin might trade higher even if the Fed rejects negative rates outright – since the U.S. central bank would instead probably just inject trillions more of freshly-created dollars into the financial system. ""Reluctance to go negative means more QE reliance,"" said Marc Ostwald, chief economist at London-based ADM Investor Services.      The Fed's money injections in response to the coronavirus crisis have helped push up bitcoin prices by 30% so far this year on speculation that inflation will eventually arrive.      ""Extremely accommodative policy is bullish for bitcoin,"" said Rich Rosenblum, founder of cryptocurrency trading firm GSR.      The Fed is already injecting about $120 billion a month into the financial system by purchasing U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, and the pace would likely increase if markets suddenly turned lower.      Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, who pushed the central bank into the money printing exercise known as quantitative easing, or QE, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has argued the practice can substitute for further rate cuts.      “Quantitative easing and forward guidance can provide the equivalent of about three additional percentage points of short-term rate cuts,” Bernanke said in January.      Federal Reserve officials have faced questions about the potential for going negative after they slashed benchmark rates close to zero in March.      As recently as this month, according to Bank of America economists, traders in the market for futures contracts on the Fed’s main interest rate were betting that the central bank might go negative as soon as 2021.      Negative rates have attracted increasing attention among foreign central banks, including the Bank of England and European Central Bank. The Bank of Japan’s main short-term lending rate is already negative, at -0.1%.  An economist with the Federal Reserve’s St. Louis branch even said recently that U.S. monetary policy officials should consider negative rates, to help bring about a sharper and broader economic recovery.      One concern over negative interest rates is they might squeeze commercial banks’ profit margins, since lenders would likely have to reduce rates on loans while struggling to convince depositors to pay banks to hold their savings.  A negative interest rate policy also might force banks to pay interest to the Fed for parking spare cash at the central bank.  “The objection is that financial market plumbing becomes more troublesome with negative rates,” said Michael Englund, principal director and chief economist at Action Economics LLC.      Yet another concern is the convoluted incentives of negative rates might be counterproductive, such as whittling down the monthly incomes of elderly savers who depend on fixed incomes from their retirement savings. That might lead them to spend less, slowing the economic recovery.  ""Low rates have winners and losers,” Englund said, such as “punishing senior citizens.”  Ostwald says the Fed might instead adopt a policy known as yield-curve control – where officials establish caps for yields on bonds of varying maturities.      The practice, which typically involves purchasing bonds to keep yields from rising too quickly, is considered yet another form of monetary policy accommodation. Analysts in the market for gold, seen as a traditional inflation hedge, have speculated that yield-curve control could be bullish for the yellow metal.      Rosenblum, at GSR, says negative rates would likely be even more bullish for bitcoin – simply because they're so unusual, and would be seen by many people as a ""strong beacon for something being broken.""      ""Printing new money via QE is not as palpable as seeing a negative interest rate,"" Rosenblum said. ""Seeing your savings literally drop by X% each month would be something completely new.""      For bitcoin investors already enjoying gains from the Fed's ongoing QE, negative rates might just represent an additional source of upside.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,540 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,579 | 24-Hr Low: $9,044      Trend: Bitcoin is taking a pause after Monday's sharp reversal higher from $8,900 to $9,500.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $9,540, having logged a session high of $9,579 during the early European trading hours, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      While the recovery has been impressive, the resistance of the trendline connecting the June 1 and 10 highs is still intact. A violation there would imply an end of the pullback from recent highs above $10,400 and open the doors once more to $10,000.      Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at the cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO, believes strong resistance at $10,000 will not let the bulls through without a fight. The cryptocurrency has failed multiple times in the last two months to keep gains above $10,000.      A notable pullback may be needed to recharge bulls' engines for a clear move above $10,000. ""Without new fundamental growth drivers it will be much easier for Bitcoin’s prices to return to $8,100 levels, build up a foundation for further growth, and only then take another shot at getting past $10,000,"" Anissimov said.      The probability of a drop to $8,100 would increase if prices find acceptance under $8,900. That would invalidate the strong dip demand signaled by Monday's long-tailed bullish hammer candle.      Prices may also fall if the global equity markets again drop sharply on coronavirus fears. Bitcoin's positive correlation with stocks has strengthened in the last few days.      From a technical analysis standpoint, Monday's bullish hammer candle has established $8,900 as the level to beat for the bears.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/16/first-mover-negative-rates-or-more-money-printing-bitcoin-may-benefit-either-way,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a387dc7d2c2a93b4d0df0872665211c7fc1ca0f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, Tokensoft’s is a private label platform, meaning tokens can be branded according to client needs.      Borda said he wants to allow investors to increase their real estate holdings or find easier exits. Most of Tokensoft’s customers are mid-sized funds – meaning the platform will be handling larger transactions with lower volumes.      “We’ve had an influx of real estate asset managers start working with us,” Borda said. “This marketplace can be for different target verticals. It just so happens that our largest customer base is real estate.”      It’s a more conservative platform in a sector of the crypto economy that has seen slow uptick in investor adoption. Through a series of partnerships, Tokensoft can offer FDIC-insured accounts, appraisal reports and broker-dealer services for asset managers in a bid to bring real estate investors to the tokenization table.

42432095,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN9hnh,1592290800,Capital One Patents AI Fact-Checker to Make Crypto Trading Safer,"A subsidiary of U.S banking group Capital One said its newly patented artificial intelligence (AI) system would save human crypto traders from potential pitfalls.      Capital One Services, which deals in credit cards and auto loans, says its system uses AI technology for ""analyzing [the] credibility of cryptocurrency-related information.""      Humans face barely surmountable obstacles and pressures when they trade crypto, the filing states.      The market runs 24/7 and it requires investors to know the intricacies and nuances of very distinct protocols as well as watch out for events such as airdrops, forks or hacks that come streaming in from multiple sources including Twitter, Medium posts and crypto news sites, the content of which cannot always be readily verified.      ""It would be impossible for human traders to track all of the above-mentioned cryptocurrency-related data and respond to that data in real-time,"" the patent reads. ""Further, it would also be difficult to verify the credibility of the cryptocurrency-related information in real time. In particular, it is difficult to verify the credibility of speculation, rumors, opinions and other information posted on social media and elsewhere.""      See also: JPMorgan Analysts: Bitcoin Is Likely to Survive (as a Speculative Asset)      Awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office last week (patent no. 10,679,229), Capital One's AI verification system can be split into three crucial components.      First, the system has a specific AI program that looks out for one kind of information such as tweets. After finding a potentially noteworthy event, it feeds it back to a ""credibility analysis engine,"" which cross-references and determines whether the event is credible based on historical examples and, if so, how the market has responded in previous instances.      It then collects all the information, processes it and uses it to make quick trading decisions.      Capital One said the AI engine could become nuanced and sophisticated at interpreting information. The system might be able to detect fake volumes and evaluate the speed by which news, such as an exchange hack, goes viral across various social media platforms and news sites.      ""The machine-learning algorithm,"" the patent reads, ""can also determine the reach ... and how quickly the news spreads out, what investors said and felt ... on social media as the news was spreading out, how long it took for the initial fear, if any, to fade out, for the ""buy-the-bottom"" mood to arise, as well as for the market to bounce back up.""      But Capital One says its patent will need further nuance before it can be launched as a new service (and generally, the filing of a patent does not necessarily indicate intention to launch a product). It's unclear as it stands whether the system could execute trades autonomously or whether they would have to be okay'd by a human first.      See also: AI for Everyone: Super-Smart Systems That Reward Data Creators      Like the rest of the U.S. banking sector, the broader Capital One group blocked account holders from purchasing crypto using their credit cards in early 2018. The bank has defended its decision, saying it wants to shield clients from the high levels of fraud, loss and inherent volatility in crypto.      This same sentiment is reflected in the patent filing: ""As with many nascent markets, many cryptocurrency investors rushed into the market without adequate knowledge and experience in either trading or cryptocurrencies. In fact, many of the cryptocurrency investors were trapped by short-term market movement and lost money quickly.""      TBut then again, Capital One knows the traps and pitfalls of crypto firsthand.
