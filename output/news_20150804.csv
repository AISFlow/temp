42378273,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgMn,1438727458,Japan Weighing Bitcoin Exchange Rules Amid Mt Gox Investigation,"UPDATE (5th August 6:50 BST): This story has been updated with comment from the Federal Services Agency.      Japanese government officials are weighing whether to regulate bitcoin exchanges in the wake of new developments in the ongoing investigation of Mt Gox.  Media reports from The Japan Times and The Japan News suggest that the government, including those from the country's Financial Services Agency, may seek to implement a registration system for exchange operators. Such a framework may include a licensing scheme and user identification requirements.  The Times quoted Finance Minister Taro Aso who said that government officials would need to ""carry out studies"" on how to properly regulate digital currency exchanges.  The news follows the arrest of Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Friday. The former Bitcoin Foundation board member faces market manipulation and embezzlement charges related to the now-defunct business, and comes nearly a year after the government decided against implementing regulation.  According to The Times, investigators believe Mt Gox may have been insolvent as early as November 2013, months before the exchange fully halted withdrawals and subsequently declared bankruptcy. Other reports suggest that the seizure of $5m in bitcoin by US officials may have exacerbated the situation.  When reached for comment, a representative the Financial Services Agency told CoinDesk:  ""We are aware of some media reports writing about regulation systems to be applied to the trading of virtual currencies. However, no official decision has been made yet regarding the FSA's stance in relation to bitcoins and other virtual currencies.""  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42378267,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgHl,1438723888,LOT Polish Airlines Now Accepts Bitcoin,"LOT Polish Airlines is now accepting bitcoin payments, meaning the digital currency can be used to pay for flights to more than 60 global destinations.  Tickets can be purchased on LOT's desktop and mobile websites. LOT does not accept directly, but exchanges the digital currency for fiat using an unnamed payment service provider, the media outlet said.  LOT now accepts bitcoin alongside payment methods including American Express, PayPal, MasterCard and Visa.  Jiri Marek, executive director of sales and distribution for the company, said the decision demonstrates how LOT is open to ""every client need"" as well as innovations in the travel industry.  Marek said:  ""Many of our customers are shopping online, including flights. It is only a matter of time before virtual currency payments will become as popular as credit card use nowadays. We saw this potential.""  With the decision, LOT becomes the latest eastern European air carrier to accept bitcoin, following airBaltic in July 2014 and Air Lituanica in August of last year. Mexico's TAR later became the first air carrier in Latin America to accept bitcoin in June.  In more developed markets, Bitnet recently inked a partnership with UATP aimed at encouraging airlines to accept bitcoin, though no integrations have been announced as a result of that deal.

42378277,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgT5,1438722040,Klarna Exec: Bitcoin Could Help Small Merchants Go Global,"To Klarna North America CEO Brian Billingsley, bitcoin and the blockchain hold the promise to solve many of the ""great problems"" affecting the payments space.  However, he says his Sweden-based company, which boasts more than 1,200 employees in 18 markets, isn't ready to join the list of online checkout startups like Shopify and Stripe that have embraced bitcoin as a payment method. According to Billingsley, the value proposition for the technology in payments and online commerce still remains unclear.  Addressing Klarna's bitcoin strategy at this week's Keynote 2015 conference, Billingsley indicated that his company's overarching goal is to remove friction for online consumers, something that today bitcoin as a digital currency doesn't quite achieve.  Billingsley told CoinDesk:  ""We've done internal pilots with bitcoin. We love the concept of a consumer paying with bitcoin, [but] we haven't seen a consumer experience to date that really makes it super frictionless.""  Billingsley did indicate that Klarna is ""actively tracking"" the technology's development, even speaking to Swedish regulators to determine when they may allow consumers to spend bitcoin with their more than 50,000 merchant partners.  Despite moving forward on this front, though, Billingsley stressed that he feels that bitcoin as a digital currency, while appealing to a tech-friendly audience, won't be effective at increasing sales for Klarna's merchants.  ""If shoppers have bitcoin, there are great use cases, but it will take us a while to figure out how to integrate this into our experience in a way that makes the average consumer happy,"" he said.  In interview, the FIS and Alliance Data veteran elaborated on the potential he sees for the technology in payments, noting specific challenges that he believes could be solved by bitcoin or the blockchain even as more attention is directed toward their non-monetary use cases.  Technology disconnect  In his conference speech and in conversation, Billingsley spoke at length about friction in the online payments process, questioning how bitcoin as a digital currency could remove e-commerce hurdles given that any new user would need to first purchase bitcoin.  Billingsley suggested this roadblock weakens the use cases for the technology, even in areas where it could gain traction, such as allowing merchants to accept payment from high-risk shoppers without assuming this added liability.  ""That runs into the chicken-and-egg problem. If you're coming through the experience, our system says you're a high-risk transaction and you need to pay with bitcoin, what if the consumer isn't using bitcoin, does the conversion fall off?"" he asked.  Even established companies like Coinbase, he said, face this issue, as no matter how easy it is to buy bitcoin with a credit card, most consumers won't see the value in the transition.  ""Unless there's a very specific merchant that only accepts bitcoin, there isn't that reason for the average consumer to set up and buy bitcoin,"" he said.  Still, he suggested that a model similar to the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) where merchants band together to create a bitcoin payments system in an effort to lower fees would be one of the most compelling models.  ""I think over time more and more people will be turned on [to the technology], but there needs to be some event,"" he continued. ""What if an MCX was successful and said 'If you pay with bitcoin you get 3% off everything?' Otherwise it might be this long slog.""  The comments echo strategies currently being executed in early stages by companies like Fold and Purse.  International payments  One trend that Billingsley does believe could be an indicator there are big problems for bitcoin and the blockchain to solve is the increasingly global reach of small merchants.  ""It's shocking how global merchants are becoming, even when they're really small,"" Billingsley said. ""We're seeing $5m–$10m merchants where 20% of their volume is from all over the world.""  These merchants, Billingsley explained, face significants tax burdens from e-commerce sales, a situation that sometimes forces businesses to establish multiple corporate entities around the world.  ""If you're a $10m merchant, it's tough to figure out how to scale,"" he said, calling this one of the biggest roadblocks to merchant growth.  Billingsley added:  ""If blockchain can alleviate payments and taxes around local entities I think it would be really powerful.""  Such business use cases, he argued, are more compelling than those aimed at consumers, as feels even those who favor cash aren't likely to adopt bitcoin.  ""I think those consumers are probably some of the least tech savvy,"" he said. ""How do you convince them that bitcoin is as safe as keeping greenbacks in your wallet?""  B2B opportunities  Like other panelists at Keynote 2015, Billingsley was bullish on the ability for bitcoin and the blockchain to penetrate business-to-business (B2B) payments verticals.  ""The cross-border payments companies should be trying to figure out how to use blockchain technology or they should be really scared about what could happen,"" Billingsley said. ""The Western Unions of the world should be really worried.""  Billingsley indicated that Klarna is curious about how it could leverage the bitcoin network to send payments between its global offices.  However, Billingsley noted that, as Klarna is a bank in Sweden, it is still weighing the risks of partaking in this use case, noting how the company remains cautious about garnering any added regulatory oversight on top of the credit and fraud risk it assumes in online shopping.  He concluded:  ""There's times when we're needing to settle out to a variety of different merchants and here is a way we can potentially settle in a better, faster and cheaper way.""

42378269,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgKH,1438715807,UK Trade Mission Brings Bitcoin and FinTech to Southeast Asia,"Last week, wallet provider Blockchain represented the bitcoin industry in an official government trade mission.  CEO Peter Smith was one of 31 executives to take part in a trade delegation, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, to promote the UK's FinTech businesses in Southeast Asia.  The FinTech sector, which now employs 135,000 people in the UK and creates $20bn in annual revenue, is a key part of the Conservative Party's plan to stimulate trade and investment.  While the nation received 42% of Europe's FinTech investment last year, trade body Innovate Finance wants to capture an even greater share of a market still dominated by Silicon Valley and predicted to be worth $46bn by 2020.  Cameron's trade mission coincided with the release of the organisation's 'UK 2020' manifesto which calls for the nation to create over 25 FinTech leaders ""whether by IPO, global market share or by valuation"".  Alongside the key players in the FinTech ecosystem, Innovate Finance also counts bitcoin firms Bitreserve, CoinFloor and Elliptic as members. Elliptic joined several other FinTech startups on a previous trade mission to America with London Mayor Boris Johnson.  Championing business  The Treasury's newly appointed 'special envoy' for FinTech, Eileen Burbidge, is a partner at VC firm Passion Capital, one of the backers behind UK exchange CoinFloor.  Though the government has mentioned bitcoin and blockchain technology in its rhetoric to date, Smith's invitation is more concrete evidence it is championing bitcoin businesses as part of its agenda.  Smith told CoinDesk:  ""Our public policy team has been actively engaged with the Prime Ministers office, as they seek to learn about the technology, formulate policy and most importantly, encourage the industry here in the UK.""  The CEO said he was ""honoured"" to be part of the mission around Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia.  ""The highlight was having the chance to explain bitcoin, and our company, to the Prime Minister while we flew between cities,"" he added.  Alongside SMEs such as RateSetter and Earthport, others in attendance included FTSE-100 insurance company Aviva and Rolls Royce, who signed a £340m deal with Vietnam Airlines during the mission.  Though many of the delegates in attendance had heard of bitcoin, their understanding was limited, Smith said. One of the biggest take-aways from the trip, he said, was the need for better education – which can be something as simple as setting up a bitcoin wallet and receiving funds.

Under the proposed laws, bitcoin exchanges in the country will be required to adhere to anti-money laundering regulations, meanwhile companies will be able to opt in to consumer protection standards, coordinated with the help of the UKDCA and the British Standards Institution (BSI).  The government is also investing $10m into research on digital currencies, in a joint venture between Research Councils, the Alan Turing Institute and Digital Catapult.  Unlike New York's ""inflexible"" BitLicense, startups have praised the UK's measures for their light touch. The FCA's regulatory sandbox has proven particularly useful for many startups who cannot afford up-front compliance costs.  In a previous interview, Marco Santori, global policy counsel at Blockchain said:  ""The clarity and research evident in the Treasury's recent publication on digital currencies demonstrates its true desire to get the details right, and to learn along with the industry in the process ... This is in welcome contrast to the blunderbuss approaches we've seen in other jurisdictions.""

Speculation about what really happened at the exchange has been rife since its collapse, with recent events representing a change in narrative.

42378272,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgO3,1438690451,Australian Senate Committee Seeks to Overturn Bitcoin Tax Ruling,"Digital currency transactions should be treated in the same way as fiat currency transactions for the purposes of Goods and Services Tax (GST), according to the Australian Senate Economics References Committee.      A new report from the committee suggests changing the way in which transactions involving bitcoin or other digital currencies are classified.      The recommendation represents a significant shift from a previous ruling by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which stated digital currencies were ""intangible assets"" and should be taxed as such.      The report, titled Digital Currency — Game Changer or Bit Player, states:      ""The committee is of the view that digital currency should be treated as money for the purposes of goods and services tax. As such, the committee recommends that the government consults with the states and territories to consider amending the definition of money in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and including digital currency in the definition of financial supply in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Regulations 1999.""              Those who made submissions to the committee, which was chaired by Senator Sam Dastyari, included Perianne Boring, president and founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Ronald Tucker, chairman at the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association.      Anglo-Australian bitcoin exchange CoinJar, the Bitcoin Foundation, the Bitcoin Association of Australia were also among the 48 organisations that submitted information.      If approved, the change will bring Australia's stance on bitcoin taxation in line with that of the UK. In March last year, HMRC – the UK's authority responsible for the collection of taxes – recognised bitcoin as a currency.    More taxation concerns  Despite the general consensus with regards to the exemption from GST, there seemed to be an extent of disagreement in relation to other taxation concerns.  ""Differing views were expressed in relation to whether digital currencies should be treated in the same way as foreign currencies for the purposes of income tax, fringe benefits tax (FBT) and capital gains tax (CGT),"" notes the report.  Some submitters did not agree with the ATO's interpretation of the existing law, arguing there was enough room within the legislation to define digital currencies as foreign currencies as opposed to commodities.  The Tax Institute noted that if a foreign country decided to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, a situation would arise whereby bitcoin would fall within the category of a ""currency of a foreign country"" and ""currency other than Australian currency"".  The report adds:  ""Bitcoin would then automatically be required to be recognised as foreign currency for income tax and GST purposes, and money for FBT purposes. It is anomalous that such a situation could arise independently and outside the control of the Australian legislature or government bodies.""    With this in mind, the committee – which held its first cryptocurrency hearing in November last year – concluded that further research and analysis was necessary to determine whether digital currency should be treated in the same way as foreign currencies in relation to income tax and fringe benefits.    Bitcoin taxation  In August last year, ATO published its bitcoin taxation guidelines, which stated how bitcoin businesses and enthusiasts would be taxed in the country.  At the time, ATO's guidelines received a mixed response from the crypto community. Similar to those issued in Singapore at the beginning of 2014, the guidelines said bitcoin would be taxed in the same way as non-cash or barter transactions.  Earlier this year, Coin Loft, an Australian exchange, received an official ruling exempting it from having to charge GST on local bitcoin sales. The firm ceased charging GST in late January.

42378282,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgWr,1438650134,FinTech Voices Join Blockchain Conversation at Keynote 2015,"Following on the heels of last week's American Banker conference, the inaugural Keynote 2015 echoed many of that event's larger themes, emphasizing the blockchain as a potentially universal solution for a variety of use cases beyond payments.  On the talking block at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles were trends such as the role of the distributed ledger in identity and security as well as its implications for consumer protection given that the technology could come to replace traditional third parties.  Overall, Keynote succeeded at providing insight into this variety of viewpoints and voices, even if many didn't express them in direct conversation on stage. For example, among the presenters were Swarm community manager Caterina Rindi and Silvio Tavares, CEO of the credit card industry group the CardLinx Association, who spoke about distributed ledgers from the viewpoints of innovators and incumbents, respectively.  Keynote 2015 chairman Moe Levin perhaps best expressed the desired and ultimate outcome of the event in his opening address, remarking:  ""Keynote is like inviting all your friends from different social circles to the same place, you hope they're open to new ideas and innovations and new experiences.""  Despite the difference in backgrounds, there was strong consensus in both camps that the blockchain will have a substantial impact, in some areas more than others.  One of the most cited was the cross-border payments industry, an opinion that was put forth by speakers as diverse as Blockchain Capital partner Brock Pierce and Karla Friede, CEO of accounts payable solutions provider Nvoicepay.  ""I believe cross-border payments will be the beachhead for bitcoin,"" Friede said. ""This sector has long been a source of exorbitant bank-based profits, making it a perfect starting point for distributed ledgers. In the world of foreign exchange, banks are making 150-300 basis points, those are extraordinarily high fees.""  This opinion was echoed by Pierce, who cited the sector as the one he believes will experience the most growth in the next 12–24 months.  Elsewhere, the event's venue seemed intent on emphasizing the difficulties of even established technologies at achieving functionality, as fire alarms, light malfunctions and microphone hiccups interrupted conversations almost as frequently as speakers referenced technical issues with bitcoin and the blockchain.  Organizers attributed the issues to a last-minute venue change for the conference.  Innovation 101  Given Keynote's goals and roots in the biannual North American Bitcoin Conference, the event gave first deference to speakers representing companies seeking to bring blockchain innovations to the FinTech sector.  Swarm's Rindi, for example, opened the day's events by explaining blockchains in layman's terms, or in her words, ""without saying ledger, crypto or bitcoin."" Her conclusion? Blockchains, including bitcoin's blockchain, are ""unalterable, dynamic, (sometimes public) online feeds, recording time-stamped data.""  She went on to give an overview of how blockchains could impact familiar business models, explaining decentralized e-commerce protocol provider OpenBazaar, decentralized ridesharing startup La'Zooz and shared Wi-Fi provider BitMesh, among other examples.  ""We'll get to that moment where blockchains are all around us. We'll know how to use them, but not how they work,"" she concluded.  Following Rindi was Micah Winkelspecht, CEO of blockchain API specialist Gem, who gave an overview of the history of money. Gold, he suggested, emerged as a common store of value due to certain intrinsic qualities, attributes he argued are analogous to bitcoin.  Winkelspecht's talk excelled when it addressed more current pain points, such as the resistance of banks toward working with bitcoin or its blockchain directly or at least openly.  ""Bitcoin's identity crisis is a lot of people wanted to disrupt banking, and now the banking system is coming into the space,"" Winkelspecht said. ""But, many features bitcoin included are not appealing to large banks.""  Ultimately, however, he concluded that these new entrants will push the overall ecosystem forward.  ""For the next few years, we're going to see a lot of advancements in distributed ledgers will come from the banking system,"" he added. ""Every single bank in the world has at least somebody looking at bitcoin.""  Payments pros take podium  The most interesting new audience in the conversation was from the traditional payments industry, with speakers such as Cardlinx' Tavares, 2Checkout chief product officer Sean Harper and Nvoicepay's Friede providing different viewpoints on the technology.  Tavares was the earliest and perhaps most bearish on the role of bitcoin as a currency in the online commerce ecosystem.  ""The reality is that any technology that seeks to displace or work alongside credit cards has a really high hurdle,"" Tavares said, before outlining what he considers the myths about credit cards that propagate in FinTech.  These included that credit cards are not anonymous or low cost, and that credit cards aren't beneficial for consumers. For example, Tavares outlined how the growing trend of card-linked accounts makes deals delivery easier for businesses.  ""You can pay with Apple Pay on a completely anonymized basis by using a token,"" he said, leaving out how in such situations a third party payments firm is privy to information.  Later in the afternoon, 2Checkout's Harper advocated that the audience refrain from writing off bitcoin as a consumer currency due to the chance it could provide cost savings and convenience as the bitcoin network scales.  ""The interesting thing to think about is that bitcoin is a very easy analog,"" Harper said, comparing the process to established money-sending services such as Western Union. ""It's easy to send someone money using bitcoin.""  Harper also emphasized the potential of the next wave of bitcoin payments startups, illustrating how successful companies like Braintree, Square and Stripe have been by making relatively small improvements to the experience for developers or consumers.  ""The difference between Square and VeriFone is one of ease of use, but it makes a hell of a difference,"" he said.  Currency use case debated  The most vocal contingent at the conference in their support for bitcoin as a currency were the representatives of the venture capital space, including many who have made prior investments in such startups.  Speakers on the investment panel included Blockchain Capital's Brock Pierce, Pantera Capital's Steve Waterhouse, VC Bill Tai and Cross Pacific Capital's Marc van der Chijs.  While the speakers noted that the blockchain has emerged as a way to cut costs in the back office, Tai spoke to this conclusion most directly.  ""Banks are measured on capital ratios and the efficiency of those assets. Blockchain is a supremely efficient way to keep track of your assets and quickly turn them over,"" he said.  Waterhouse addressed the rising interest in private blockchains that use bitcoin's underlying data structure, without the currency token, expressing his belief that activities conducted on any bitcoin alternatives today will eventually be conducted on the protocol.  ""Inside your company a printer has an IP address and it can see the Internet, but I can't see it,"" Waterhouse said. ""It will be similar to that, they're going to be able to see each other, but they're hidden to people at other organizations. Regardless of the currency that's used on one or the other, it will converge.""  Also discussed was whether these enterprise organizations are currently seeking to acquire startups in the blockchain space.  ""Banks aren't looking to buy things yet, they're doing what they should be doing, getting smart,"" Pierce said.  Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham was perhaps the most striking in his opinions, stressing that while there's ""no right answer"" to the question of whether bitcoin the currency, or bitcoin the decentralized ledger, will prove more successful at spurring innovation.  His belief is that while the later presents a better opportunity today, but that the new activity on bitcoin's ledger could in turn bolster trading of what he called ""the world's first digital commodity"".  Lingham was perhaps most bearish on bitcoin in the short term, a statement given added weight as his company is perhaps the most successful in the ecosystem at reaching consumers.  ""I think the whole idea of bitcoin is so consumer unfriendly, I can't see it taking off and we're the largest consumer site on the blockchain. It's not going to go mainstream.""
