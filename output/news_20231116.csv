20277050,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560958,1700172009,Bitcoin Open Interest Tops 19-Month High: Historical Data Shows What To Expect,"The Bitcoin open interest can often be an indication of where the BTC price might be headed next depending on whether or not the metric is rising or falling. This time around, the Bitcoin open interest has risen drastically, hitting 19-month highs in the process. Using historical data, it is possible to extrapolate what this means for the crypto’s price, especially as investors remain very bullish. Bitcoin Open Interest Surges To $17.04 Billion In an interesting turn of events, the Bitcoin open interest has been rising quickly across various exchanges. In the last 24 hours alone, this metric rose by a cumulative 7.89% across all exchanges in the space, bringing the total open interest to 454,150 BTC worth a staggering $17.04 billion. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout: Analyst Explains Why The King Of The Altcoins Is Destined For $10,000 For now, most of the Bitcoin open interest is concentrated across the CME, Binance, and ByBit exchanges. But perhaps what is even more interesting is that these open interest levels represent a 19-month high. Source: CoinGlass According to the data presented on the CoinGlass website, the last time that the Bitcoin open interest moved in this fashion and to this high was back in March 2022, before the historical Terra LUNA crash that sent the market into a prolonged bear market stretch. This means that the last time that the Bitcoin open interest rose this much was during a time when investors were still very much in the throes of bull run euphoria. As such, the historical performance of the BTC price back then in relation to the open interest could serve as a guide to what might happen to the digital asset’s price next. BTC price finds support at $37,400 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Historical Data Says BTC Price Will Surge Similar to the current trend, the Bitcoin open interest had surged from around 38,000 BTC to over 44,000 BTC in the space of a month, and the BTC price followed quickly. This trend saw the price rise in March 2022 from $38,700 to over $47,000 before the month was over. Related Reading: Stunning Correlation Emerges Between XRP And XLM, What’s Going On? Going by this historical performance and assuming Bitcoin sticks to this trend, the rally may be far from over. The BTC price is also sitting at a similar price point at $37,500 and a similar surge could bring its price toward $45,000 before the month is over. However, there is also the possibility that the open interest could peak at this level and begin to decline. Once this happens, then in the same fashion as in April 2022, the BTC price could begin to decline as the open interest drops. A similar crash would send the price back down toward $27,000.

The operation, broadly labeled by the agencies as GS Partners, is an organization that includes GSB Gold Standard Bank Ltd., Swiss Valorem Bank Ltd. and GSB Gold Standard Corporation AG – all said to be controlled by Josip Dortmund Heit. The businesses hired sports celebrities such as former boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and footballer Roberto Carlos to get attention to an array of investments, regulators said.  The affiliated businesses are accused of violating state laws when they ""offered and sold unqualified securities and made material misrepresentations and omissions to investors related to crypto asset investments,"" according to the case filed Thursday by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Texas, Alabama and other jurisdictions are pursuing similar actions.  The business has been ""broadly perpetrating various fraudulent investment schemes  that are threatening immediate and irreparable public harm,"" according to an action Thursday from the Texas State Securities Board.  ""These investment schemes are often marketed as a unique opportunity to earn lucrative profits and secure generational wealth through blockchain technology, a metaverse, liquidity and staking pools, a tokenized skyscraper and digital assets purportedly convertible to physical gold,"" the Texas agency described in its emergency cease-and-desist order.  One part of the business offered digital assets tied to the metaverse's Lydian World, and another investments in a 36-story ""G999 Tower"" that ""radiates majesty as it shines under the burning sun"" in Dubai, according to marketing information described in the Texas case. The business also operated a multi-level marketing platform that offered “MetaCertificates,” regulators said.

It was just 24 hours ago that bitcoin was surging and within a few dollars of crossing the $38,000 level for the first time in more than 18 months.  As has been a familiar trend during the upswing over the past six weeks, a wave of sell orders was likely sitting close to a round number. When bitcoin approached $38,000, the sell orders took over, sending the price lower. That, in turn, triggered liquidations of leveraged long positions, sending the price hurtling further downward.  Indeed, the crypto market's two-day rollercoaster hit derivatives traders heavily, liquidating some $340 million of leveraged positions over the period, CoinGlass data shows.  SOL, LINK give up gains; AVAX extends rally  Most cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin lower during the day, with ether [ETH] dropping 4% over the past 24 hours to $1,960. Solana's [SOL] and Chainlink's native token [LINK] declined 6% and 9%, respectively.  Fading the plunge today was Avalanche's native token [AVAX], extending yesterday's double-digit rally with another 7% gain.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], which tracks the performance of a basket of almost 200 cryptocurrencies, dropped 4% during the day.  Spot bitcoin ETF delay slows momentum  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Wednesday delayed a decision about HashDex's spot BTC ETF application, increasing the odds that it won't approve any such vehicles this year.  Crypto market analytics firm K33 Research noted earlier this week in a report said that a lack of an SEC decision this week could halt momentum in the crypto market until the next deadline early in 2024.  Heightened optimism about spot ETFs and what are hoped to be sizable institutional and retail inflows helped propel bitcoin from $25,000 in September to just shy of $38,000.

42409480,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHkbs,1700167968,Time Is Running Out for Crypto Leaders to Reason With the IRS,"This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week, presented by TaxBit. Matan Doyich is the co-founder and CEO of Crypto Index.  Far from being just another set of rules, the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) proposed ""broker rule"" aims to establish an overarching taxation framework for digital assets. It’s also become a rallying cry for crypto leaders to unite against what many perceive as a potential encroachment on privacy rights, innovation and a departure from crypto’s decentralized foundations.  Does this sound familiar?  With the Security and Exchange Commission mulling its own comprehensive crypto regulations — looking to fill a regulatory gap by bringing digital asset exchanges under their purview — the IRS proposal could serve as the perfect test for how the industry rallies together and uses its combined strength to offset crippling government overreach.  Sliding into the abyss  The Blockchain Association, a lobbying group based in Washington D.C., issued a scathing response to the IRS, stating that the proposed rules not only exceed the government's authority but also reveal a fundamental lack of understanding of digital assets and decentralized technology. Such shortcomings may unleash a cascade of unintended consequences, negatively impacting the very core of the crypto ethos.  Others have sounded alarms about the regulations threatening a nascent industry before it can truly get off the ground, setting a dangerous precedent of surveillance.  At the heart of the industry pushback is a shared concern for privacy rights and the preservation of the founding principles that helped shape crypto into an attractive and diverse user base. Expanding the definition of ""brokers"" is seen as a potential privacy infringement as it broadens the scope to include participants such as decentralized finance (DeFi) developers, who may not have traditional access to customer information. This extension raises serious concerns about unnecessary reporting requirements that could compromise individual privacy, especially within the context of DeFi where privacy and anonymity are key tenets.  The clash between these regulations and DeFi’s pseudonymous, decentralized features also potentially leads to stifled innovation and collapsing underlying technologies due to impractical regulatory constraints. The signs here are ominous: “It will drive U.S.-based decentralized projects abroad or out of existence, full stop,” claims a senior counsel at the Blockchain Association.  Is time running out?  A rallying call spurred by the proposed regulations extends beyond opposition — it is a call to action for crypto leaders to actively participate in the shaping of their regulatory frameworks. While the regulations may pose challenges, they have also ignited a spark within the industry to proactively engage with policymakers, advocating for sensible and fair regulatory measures that foster innovation rather than stifling it.  See also: The IRS Should Heed This Warning | Tax Week 2023  The proposed tax rule was open for 74 days of public comment and garnered over 124,000 public comments in that span. As it now moves to consideration and discussion, the time for action cannot be stressed enough.  Leaders buoyed by the crypto industry's substantial political influence — reflected in a $21.6 million federal lobbying spending in 2022 — can strategically unite. By pooling resources, they can amplify their collective strength to engage in a targeted approach with regulators by conducting educational campaigns and encouraging open dialogues.  This united front aims to navigate regulatory challenges effectively, ensuring that regulations accommodate the distinctive features of the crypto space, promote innovation and safeguard privacy rights.

Dogecoin Tags Parabolic SAR: Another 23,000% Surge Ahead? During the last crypto bull market, Dogecoin was on of the standout stars, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other altcoins. Driven by meme mania, stimulation checks, and Elon Musk tweets, DOGE made a lot of people a lot of money. Prior to the bull run in 2020, the Doge-inspired meme coin spent over three years in a downtrend. Right before the breakout that sent Dogecoin soaring DOGEUSD price action had tapped the 1M Parabolic SAR. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu: Which Meme Coin Is More Profitable For Holders? Not even one year after the monthly Parabolic SAR was tagged on the USD trading pair, Dogecoin put in over a 23,000% rally before reaching a peak in 2021. The Parabolic SAR has been triggered | DOGEUSD on TradingView.com Can The Parabolic SAR Revive Meme Coin Season Once Again? The Parabolic SAR is a technical indicator designed by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. responsible for creating other popular tools like the Relative Strength Index, Average Directional Index, and Average True Range. The acronym SAR stands for Stop and Reverse, and the tool’s intention is to tell an analyst when a trend has potentially stopped and reversed. In 2020, the signal in Dogecoin indeed was the final point before the downtrend stopped and reversed up to new highs. Now that the signal has been triggered again, what type of move might we be able to expect from the meme coin? Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction for 2023, 2024, 2025, 2030 & Beyond As stated, the last time it was tagged DOGEUSD rallied more than 23,000%. The Parabolic SAR was also hit on the 1M timeframe in April 2017 just before another 6,200% rally. An average of the two major rallies suggests a possible 14,600% surge. However, Elliott Wave Principle points to the first wave of any cycle being similar in magnitude as the final wave – hinting at another 6,200% ROI if an uptrend does materialize from here.

Zhong Shi Gao, Naifeng Xu and Fei Jiang allegedly stole millions of dollars from nearly a dozen financial institutions throughout the New York metropolitan area between 2018 and 2022, law enforcement officials said. The trio bilked banks out of the funds by posing as victims of fraudulent money transfers, prompting institutions to credit them in the amount of the supposed unauthorized transfers and ""effectively doubling their money,"" according to an indictment.  ""These charges should serve as a warning to fraudsters and cybercriminals who think they can turn to cryptocurrency to hide their identities – together with our partner agencies, we will find you and hold you accountable for your crimes,"" Williams said in the statement.  Each of the accused men has been arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and faces four criminal charges in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York: bank fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, money laundering conspiracy and aggravated identity theft. The maximum sentence for all the charges combined could amount to nearly 100 years, the release shows.  Authorities said the men enlisted foreign nationals from China and Taiwan to open U.S. bank accounts that the trio could use to manage the transfers that they'd pretend were unwanted.

42409492,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHlFY,1700157930,"Sam Bankman-Fried's Trial May Be Over, but The Bahamas Is Living Its Own Trial","Nassau, The Bahamas — In early 2022, Ryan Austin was part of a non-profit foundation devoted to teaching people in The Bahamas how to code. One of the early donations it received was from FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange that operated from the nation. The $30,000 contribution was made to train public school teachers in coding. About 90 teachers were shown how to teach public school kids to code during the summer in a kind of boot camp.  Austin went back to the FTX team with statistics reflecting the program's success with a request: Let's do this again.  ""I think they were quite impressed and thought of using our data to boost their CSR [Corporate Social Responsibility],"" he told CoinDesk. FTX gave Austin and his team a pat on the back and the kind of goodbye that said, ""We'll be in touch."" That didn't happen.  Instead, in November 2022, the FTX empire dramatically and rapidly collapsed into bankruptcy after a chain of events triggered by a CoinDesk report that raised questions about FTX's financials. On Nov. 2, 2023, a jury found FTX founder Bankman-Fried guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy tied to the exchange's operation.  Many decisions that led to ""one of the biggest financial frauds in American history"" took place outside the U.S., in The Bahamas, where FTX's leadership set up shop in 2021.  ""There was a wave, an excitement about FTX in the air,"" a nostalgic Austin told CoinDesk. ""Businesses got a boost from their existence here. Employees were paid well and there was a lot of excitement around crypto and then suddenly, everyone was trying to figure out what the hell happened.""  Pre-collapse  In October 2023, as Bankman-Fried fought for his innocence in a Manhattan courthouse, downtown Nassau, the capital city of The Bahamas, appeared to be ""a ghost town,"" though that wasn't entirely reflective of its economy.  ""There's no Bahamas without tourism. It's the slow season. No cruise ship today. On Wednesday we had six (so it was different). Things pick back up around December,"" said Mike Larry, a taxi driver. On days when cruise ships don't arrive, shopkeepers often shut shops to enjoy a day off, in the ""laid back"" spirit of the Caribbean nation.  Economic activity, primarily tourism, has suffered in The Bahamas since the double whammy of Hurricane Dorian in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic, costing the nation a loss of $9.5 billion. Together with construction and manufacturing, tourism accounts for 60% of the developing nation's GDP, which was $12.9 billion in 2022.  But when FTX made The Bahamas its base in September 2021, moving from the uncertainty of Hong Kong to the warmer shores of the archipelago, a funky cocktail of hope and skepticism hit the stands.  ""If you came here last year everyone was talking about crypto. That ain't make no sense,"" said Larry as he drove through Nassau. ""I don't know [about cryptocurrency]. They say, 'Put money you are willing to lose,' but the only thing I am willing to lose is my girlfriend.""  CoinDesk spoke to more than a dozen locals to gauge their interest in cryptocurrency or FTX before its collapse. Around half of them said they had little knowledge about crypto or showed a lack of risk-taking appetite. But almost all of the individuals holding white-collar jobs who spoke to CoinDesk invested in crypto in some form or the other.  ""People here don't trust crypto because we love to feel the money,"" said Mario Young, technology manager at ST Global Markets, a crypto broker registered in The Bahamas. ""But FTX invested a lot in the economy, donating to schools and the main shelter. So it seemed legitimate, as the government seemed to be on board with everything.""  'The red carpet'  Young said he did not know much about FTX's relationship with The Bahamas government, and he still doesn't. But hints emerged during Bankman-Fried's trial this past October.  While testifying, Bankman-Fried told prosecutor Danielle Sassoon he didn't remember making an offer to pay off The Bahamas' $11.6 billion national debt to the nation's Prime Minister Philip Davis in 2021. The offer was made, according to Michael Lewis' recent book about Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors also shared an email purportedly from Davis' personal Gmail account, asking Bankman-Fried to speak to Davis' son about a non-fungible token project the younger Davis was part of.  Larry claimed he knew ""a lot of big people who are in government and they got what they needed from"" Bankman-Fried, without providing evidence. ""He bought $300 million worth of property, right? I didn't even see him."" Nearly $300 million was spent on real estate, largely homes and vacation properties for senior staff, an FTX attorney told a Delaware court days after the bankruptcy was filed.  In October 2021, Davis cut a ribbon with Bankman-Fried to officially open the FTX office. A few months later, in April 2022, FTX broke ground on a $60 million headquarters in The Bahamas, which Davis said would rival Google's headquarters. Construction never began, and the worksite remains abandoned in what looks like a mini-jungle fenced from all sides.  The Bahamas government or its Securities Commission did not return requests for an interview.  Last month, Prime Minister Davis' message at a pre-conference dinner was emblematic of the strategy the Bahamas had adopted: ""no risk, no reward."" The next day, in his opening address at the conference, he expanded on it.  ""Last night at dinner after my toast, I was reminded by a guest at my table that The Bahamas is a pioneer in the digital asset space, and history has proven that pioneers did not succeed without overcoming many obstacles or, as he put it, 'without taking licks,'"" Davis said without mentioning FTX.  (Disclaimer: The Bahamas government provided travel and accommodation for this reporter to attend this conference in the nation held on Oct. 12 and 13, but wasn't involved with this article.)  The Bahamas, living its own trial  Bankman-Fried's trial may be over but The Bahamas appears to still be living through its own trial, hit by the stigma of rolling out a red carpet for FTX.  The local residents CoinDesk spoke to said they were not closely following Bankman-Fried's trial, but they did question whether Bahamian authorities handled FTX and its unraveling appropriately.  On Nov. 9, 2022, FTX halted all crypto withdrawals. But a day later, the company tweeted that it had ""begun to facilitate withdrawals of Bahamian funds,"" citing ""our Bahamian HQ's regulation and regulators.""  Read more: Crypto Exchange FTX Reopens Bahamian Withdrawals: Nansen  On Nov. 12, 2022, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas issued a statement citing that tweet, saying that it had not told FTX to prioritize Bahamian withdrawals. ""The Commission does not condone the preferential treatment of any investor or client of FTX.""  However, prosecutors at Bankman-Fried's trial showed the jury an email in which he offered to reopen Bahamian withdrawals:  We are deeply grateful for what The Bahamas has done for us, and deeply committed to it. We are also deeply sorry about this mess.  Bahamian regulators managed to exert some control over FTX, freezing FTX assets and suspending its registration. On Nov. 11, FTX, a Bahamian entity, filed for bankruptcy protection in a U.S. court. On Nov. 13, Bahamian authorities opened a criminal investigation into FTX.  ""It was a powerful event, especially for the financial sector,"" Young said. ""Everyone was just in disbelief because FTX was the next big thing, it bought up a bunch of property and they were spending a lot of money.""  Exactly one month later, after U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against Bankman-Fried, the Royal Bahamas Police Force arrested the FTX founder.  Young appeared to give the Bahamian authorities the benefit of the doubt while pointing to the news report that stated Bankman-Fried had offered to pay off the nation's debt. ""We just don't know (about the involvement of the government), but now people will always associate Bahamas with FTX.""  Larry's distrust for crypto and the government were in equal parts. ""I didn't have the time to do my own research and I don't just go with what the government says.""  Austin believed the arrival of FTX and its collapse were both watershed moments.  ""I had friends working in the space, people studying, excited about worthwhile careers,"" he said. ""Young people were investing, buying land and getting mortgages. The bringing up of young people happened as quickly as it did because of FTX. And its collapse is also a watershed moment because it highlighted so many of the issues with crypto, for the better.""  But he did have questions: ""Who's involved from the government? Why wasn't there oversight? Was there oversight? Were they too close to the regulators? How does it impact us when they resume regulatory perspective?""  The Bahamas resumed regulatory updates five months after FTX's collapse by stating a desire to tighten its crypto laws, but not before facing a barrage of hits to its credibility as an innovative pioneer in financial services – FTX's new leadership responsible for restructuring called its Bahamas arm a ""shell setup"" to further Bankman-Fried's fraud. It also accused Bahamian authorities of aiding Bankman-Fried's attempts to escape justice and of directing unauthorized access to FTX's systems in order to withdraw assets.  Since then, the nation has been fighting a crisis of confidence, a referendum on its credibility as a hub for financial services, which is the Caribbean nation's second-largest industry after tourism, accounting for 15% of its GDP.  Its strategy seemingly borrows a page from Harry Potter, making FTX the equivalent of Lord Voldemort, adopting the strategy of not ever naming ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"" – FTX.  ""I believe from a PR perspective, The Bahamas is doing a good job,"" Austin said. ""Just trying to stay out of it as much as possible, by not saying much and that's what I think it is. We're trying to navigate this without causing too much damage.""  Simultaneously, the government oversaw over 10 new companies registering in The Bahamas as a digital asset business over the past year and has promised new measures to its crypto regulatory framework, the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Act (DARE Act).  ""DARE Act will include – among other things – measures to clarify the regulation of stablecoins, and the introduction of more robust investor and consumer protection mechanisms, including new provisions for a single framework for the registration and oversight of digital assets custodians and the provision of custodial wallet services and requirements for the segregation of assets,"" Prime Minister Davis announced during last month's conference.  The amendments are expected to be passed in Parliament by the end of the year, Davis said, and they also include a framework for the staking of clients' digital assets and the operation or management of a staking pool as a business.  Digital assets and The Bahamas, here to stay?  A short stop at Nassau's Margaritaville Beach Resort, a lounging haunt of Bankman-Fried, who was known as SBF, and the friends who turned on him, didn't reveal any remnants of the FTX culture.  On the other side of the island from where Ernst & Young, Citibank and others have offices is where the luxury Albany complex where SBF and friends lived in a penthouse sits perched by the ocean. The gated community made tête-à-tête's with SBF's neighbors or sneak peeks nearly impossible.  As the sun set, a stunt biker rode by in an apparent rush to join a favorite weekend pastime of the locals. The next stop was Cocoplum, a restaurant Bankman-Fried and FTX used to good measure.  A waiter, who asked for anonymity as he was not allowed to speak publicly, told CoinDesk that Bankman-Fried had drawn other patrons' eyes in the past.  ""It was another guest who turned around and asked, 'Do you know who that guy is?'"" the waiter said. ""He is very rich. [Bankman-Fried] looked like an ordinary Joe. I served him. Seemed nice. I wouldn't say he did any big tipping. Our restaurant gets millionaires all the time.""  The waiter insisted that the restaurant wasn't affected by the collapse of FTX, even though it supplied food to FTX's cafeteria. ""I don't know about the nation's economy, but as a restaurant, FTX's collapse hasn't affected us.""  Exact data showing FTX's impact on The Bahamas doesn't exist, but the nation's GDP hints that it didn't suffer as much as may have been expected from a company which once offered to pay off the entire nation's national debt. GDP dropped from $13.06 billion in 2019 to $9.76 billion in 2020, but has been rising since. The GDP grew to $11.53 billion in 2021, $12.9 billion in 2022 and is projected to rise to $13.88 billion in 2023. This is in line with a study in February 2022 that said the Bahamian economy will return to pre-pandemic size in 2023.​  Still, the loss of the opportunity FTX promised and the damage as a result of the perceived red-carpet association with FTX remains incalculable.  ""I believe we're still OK because our finance industry is a strong financial product and people are coming here, investing and holding large accounts and family accounts every single day,"" Austin said.  In fact, the nation's leadership has resolved to regain credibility. At the conference, Prime Minister Davis said, ""The Bahamas will continue to be a pioneer in the digital asset space"" and touted the nation's Sand Dollar as the world's first central bank digital currency.  In the meantime, the shock of the downfall of FTX and SBF remains embedded in the psyche of a nation.  ""We were surprised. We all knew bitcoin could be a shady business, but the guy was on the cover of Forbes, who would have thought,"" the waiter said.  Read all of CoinDesk's SBF trial coverage here.

Crypto trader Rekt Capital claims that the recent price action confirmed a bullish trajectory for the token. The chart below shows that Dogecoin completed a path from its yearly lows at $0.052 across October and November. As the bulls pushed upwards, the cryptocurrency broke its descending channel, setting a path towards the area above $0.11, last seen in 2022. DOGE Price Likely To Return To All-Time High A separate report from another crypto trader looks at Dogecoin over high timeframes. The token is close to completing a bigger breakout over its Bitcoin (BTC) trading pair on this horizon. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu: Which Meme Coin Is More Profitable For Holders?

It remains to be seen if DOGE can return to its 2022 and 2021 high against its Bitcoin and USDT trading pairs.

On this day last month, MATIC was trading around its October bottom of $0.5154 before the inflows into the crypto market. Although the cryptocurrency has performed reasonably well and has increased by 82% since then, its rise has mostly been overshadowed by inflows into Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies such as Solana, which has seen an 188% increase in the same period. After briefly falling below $0.9 many times this week due to consolidations, MATIC has now blasted off minor support at the $0.91 level. On-chain metrics like transaction count addresses making a profit and open interest on futures contracts all point to a continued surge for MATIC. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs.

At the same time, data from IntoTheBlock shows that large transaction volume (transactions of over $100,000) reached $636 million in the past 24 hours, an increase of more than 387% from yesterday. According to the analytics website, this is a surge of more than 3,800% compared to 30 days ago. The volume of MATIC futures trading has also increased in the past week, as shown by the amount of open interest. According to chart data from Coinalyze, open interest on various MATIC futures markets has jumped by 120% this month. As shown by the chart below, the total open interest is now at $260 million from $118 million on November 1. This dramatic increase shows that more traders are betting on MATIC’s price rising significantly in the future. Source: IntoTheBlock MATIC currently has one of the highest percentages of addresses who bought around the current price in profit. Data from IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” metric show that 71.23% of MATIC addresses that bought between $0.800122 and $1.08 are making a profit at the moment. In comparison, around 66.99% of Bitcoin addresses who bought around the current price are making a profit. Source: IntoTheBlock MATIC Price To Reach $2? Technical analysis of MATIC’s price chart shows the token could be gearing up for over $1 or higher in the coming weeks.

The Ordinals protocol enables users to inscribe data into satoshis – the smallest units of bitcoin – in effect creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin network. The protocol debuted at the start of this year, becoming a divisive issue for the Bitcoin community, with some participants saying they are pointlessly congesting the network.  Nearly 1.9 million inscriptions were uploaded to the blockchain in the two weeks spanning the end of October and the start of November, driving network fees to nearly $7, up some 970% from the start of August.

Yet the misconception that crypto is used primarily for money laundering still prevails. Based on publicly available data, there’s been a record increase of 237% of bitcoin wallet holders with over $1 million in them - talk about transparency.  This week, Dawood Khan from Alix Partners looks at on-chain analytics, tracing tools and just how much illicit activity leverages crypto and discusses why advisors should learn about blockchain technology.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  How On-chain Tracking of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Transactions Help Protect Investors and Improve Adoption  Growing interest in cryptocurrencies is fueling the market  Cryptocurrencies have attracted a wide range of interest from individuals to start-ups exploring the uses of blockchain technology, and some companies are allocating a portion of their balance sheet into assets like bitcoin. However, the latest buzz has been all about the possibility of the SEC allowing spot bitcoin ETFs to trade in the U.S. by early 2024. While Canada has had bitcoin ETFs for a few years and Europe recently launched its first ETF, the U.S. market represents a significantly larger market. This opens the door for large financial institutions to enter; some of the initial ETF applicants include BlackRock, VanEck, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton. Outside of the ETF buzz, we’ve seen financial institutions such as JPMorgan experiment with the technology, namely using a “forked” version of Ethereum known as Quorum (later sold to ConsenSys). Now JPMorgan is reportedly exploring blockchain-based deposit tokens to speed up cross-border payments and settlement.  Cryptocurrencies, and the now-adopted term “digital assets,” mean different things to different people. A good way to start is to understand how the technology and the digital assets can be of benefit. As there are a plethora of online pundits, careful assessment of educational sources is important. Reputable programs are available online through the professional bodies such as the CIO Association and universities including MIT and Cornell.  Some types of digital assets are best suited to enable transactions, such as stablecoins, which provide a stable value representation pegged to a particular fiat currency. They are a way to access the global financial system. In developing countries, access to dollar-denominated assets can be a literal life saver. Some use them for daily payments, while others simply want to preserve their wealth.  Others view certain digital assets as an investment opportunity. For instance, Fidelity Digital Assets recently revisited its analysis of bitcoin, highlighting the difference between the broader “crypto token” ecosystem and bitcoin’s emergence as the go-to digital asset.  On the ultra-bull end of the spectrum you have those like Michael Saylor and his company MicroStrategy which adopted their “bitcoin strategy” in 2020, using cash flows and debt to purchase bitcoin for their balance sheet. MicroStrategy have radically outperformed the market since then.  Skepticism exists – some rightly placed and some misinformed  Unfortunately, what gets a lot of attention is the perception that cryptocurrencies are easy to use for criminal and illicit activity due to its perceived anonymity and difficulty in tracking the culprits. Other concerns include regulatory uncertainty, cryptocurrency price volatility, and the ecosystem’s disruption from multiple bankruptcies. There have been allegations and convictions for fraud, ponzi schemes and misappropriation of funds.  You may have seen news stories about dark web criminals and hackers wanting payment in bitcoin or other types of crypto. These reports have contributed to the perception that cryptocurrency is seen as a haven for criminals or terrorists. However, if we look at an analysis of criminal activity conducted by Chainalysis, illicit activity represented 0.24% of all crypto transactions in 2022. For perspective, the total market cap of cryptocurrencies is approximately $1.3 trillion as of Q4 2023. The UN’s Office on Drugs and Crime estimates the amount of money laundered in one year at around 2-5% of global GDP, or $800 billion-$2 trillion – more than the entire market cap of all crypto assets.  This is not to say that crime doesn’t take place. It does, according to Chainalysis, and in 2022, criminal activity represented $20 billion in illicit activity including use of crypto by sanctioned entities, scams and stolen funds.  While criminals use sophisticated approaches, tracking is possible  Although blockchain transactions are pseudo-anonymous, they are also recorded as part of the transaction on an end-to-end, fully traceable audit trail, captured on a permanent immutable ledger of transactions. Cryptocurrency transactions recorded on the ledger are uniquely identifiable, which allows investigators to track relationships between certain addresses, wallets, and entities. These relationships can be used by investigators to identify ties to regulated “on-ramps” to reveal connections to real-world entities. For major networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, a sophisticated and rapidly-improving on-chain surveillance regime is emerging which has, and will continue to, root out bad actors.  Tracing assets is both a science and an art that continues to be perfected through the use of tools created by companies such as Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs and CipherTrace. Specialists use these tools to analyze and track transactions to trace cryptocurrencies leveraging the benefits of on-chain data to understand the full picture.  Last year, Axie Infinity’s (a popular metaverse gaming platform) Ronin bridge, used to transfer digital assets to the chain, experienced one of the largest crypto-hacks where $615 million were stolen in ether (ETH) and USDC stablecoin, with U.S. authorities linking the heist to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus Group. The culprits first exchanged the USDC stablecoins into ETH through decentralized exchanges (DEX), which typically do not conduct Know-Your-Customer/Anti-Money-Laundering (KYC/AML) compliance checks. Centralized exchanges coming under regulatory scrutiny have started to do these over the last few years. Interestingly enough, as shown in the graph, they then started to launder $16.7 million in ETH through three centralized exchanges. However, as the centralized exchanges started to collaborate with law enforcement, the culprits moved to using Tornado Cash a decentralized mixer, that was later sanctioned by U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and lost it’s appeal on the validity of the sanction in court. According to Elliptic, “Elliptic investigators are tracking these stolen funds and have labelled the addresses associated to this attacker in our systems.”  The graph from Elliptic Investigator shows how complex on-chain activity can be analyzed and tracked. In this case, it shows how the Lazarus Group laundered stolen funds following the Ronin Hack (Source: Elliptic)  According to Kevin Madura of AlixPartners, “criminal elements are beginning to realize that blockchains provide a goldmine of intelligence information and are actually the worst place to conduct illicit activity. Investors should understand that the characteristics of networks like bitcoin, and the ecosystem surrounding it, actually benefit good actors.”  From retail investment to institutional and corporate interest - On-chain Tracking is crucial for investor protection  In conclusion, the growing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly in the context of potential SEC approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US, will continue to attract bad actors and hackers, and on-chain tracking is a critical part of protecting investors. However, it's important to note that, despite concerns about illicit activities, the percentage of criminal activity in crypto transactions is relatively small.  Moreover, while cryptocurrencies are often associated with illicit activities due to their pseudo-anonymity, the reality is that these transactions are recorded on an end-to-end, fully traceable and immutable ledger that provides a built-in audit trail. This allows for the possibility of tracking relationships between certain addresses, wallets, and entities, making it far easier to trace illicit activity across the entire transaction chain. This is made possible through the blockchain record itself and enhanced by on-chain analysis tools.  Given the ever-evolving nature of blockchain technology, a dynamic cryptocurrency market and regulations - it is critical that advisors and investors invest time in learning and understanding what looks to be the emerging future of global finance, trade and commerce.  – Dawood Khan, AlixPartners  Ask an Expert  Q: Can chain analytics add to the security of a network?  Yes. A common misconception is that crypto is completely anonymous and therefore perfect for criminals to move money in a permissionless manner without worrying about KYC/AML banking rules. The truth is that users are pseudonymous, meaning that once an address is associated with a person their entire transaction history can be revealed. So chain analytics can be used to work backward from a known address to build a history of known activity. Further, because anyone in the general public can access on-chain data it actually makes it harder to keep illegal money movement on the down low. There are countless people looking at on-chain data at any given moment. Many do it as a hobby and post their findings on X (Twitter). With so many eyes around the world monitoring on-chain data it makes it harder for illegal activities to fly under the radar and adds security to the network.  Q: What meaningful data can be gathered from on-chain analytics?  As managers investing on behalf of clients, we are constantly monitoring on-chain analytics to ensure we are making informed decisions. You can gather a lot of useful, actionable information with on-chain analytics. For example, you can look at unique wallet addresses. If this is growing rapidly it could mean that adoption of the project is picking up. You could also look at wallet activity if there are a lot of transactions, addresses sending crypto back and forth, it could indicate that the project has a meaningful user base and it is not solely being traded on centralized exchanges. You can also see what percentage of the supply of a token is held by the largest wallet addresses. This is important because the main ethos of crypto is decentralization and giving autonomy to its users. However if a project’s tokens are more or less held by a few large wallets then this leads to a centralization that allows a few whales to manipulate, price, rewards, governance, etc. These are just a few examples. Analysis of this data is constantly evolving and new, meaningful relationships, ratios, and statistics are being discovered and tracked. And since this is done on public ledgers, anyone with an internet connection can do their own analysis. – Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Keep Reading  BlackRock files for another crypto spot ETF, this time ETH according to a Nasdaq filing.

42392014,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzBHL,1700151748,There Is a World of Web3 Outside the U.S. and Europe,"Upon returning from Token2049 in Singapore, my perceptions have been profoundly reshaped. What truly astounded me was the depth and dynamism of the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region in the Web3 realm.  While the United States and Europe often dominate the global crypto conversation, I'd always sensed that APAC held more than met the eye. Still, experiencing its intricacies firsthand blew me away.  Web3 isn’t being built in North America and Western Europe only.  Far from a monolithic entity, APAC has emerged as a kaleidoscope of unique cultures, each with its distinct contribution to the evolving Web3 narrative, often challenging and complementing Western perspectives. As the digital landscape continues to unfold, a deepened appreciation of these diverse cultures is essential to foster genuine global collaborations.  The crypto industry is an events industry these days. While on the events circuit I started to see the same people at each conference almost everywhere I go. No offense to any of those people, but it just wasn’t making sense. I started to ask myself what was the value in going to places where there was no new business to be won?  If all we’re doing is spending time talking to the same people we know from North American and Western Europe at each of these places, giving emphasis only to them when it comes to attending events, then are we actually going to get anything done?  Attending an event in a new part of the world is a quick way to approach a new frontier making strides in Web3 — and a way to accomplish new things personally. At the end of the day, this is what we in crypto should all be doing: stepping outside our comfort zones and encountering firsthand all the ways crypto is and can be used.  See also: Gemini to Expand in APAC to Capture 'Next Wave' of Crypto  There were certainly speed bumps to attending the event in Singapore. Many of my counterparts weren't planning on going. This dismissal sometimes, not always, seemed xenophobic — it definitely felt like there’s a part of our industry that looks at what’s happening in the East as if it’s subpar. This didn't make sense to me before I attended Token2049, and it definitely doesn't after.  Speaking as a typical Westerner, it's easy to write off the distinct cultures that comprise the Asia–Pacific (APAC) region. Talking to people from there showed me just how important it is to be on the ground, getting a chance to meet real people and actually learn from different perspectives.  Reflecting on distinct countries, several differences stand out. Singapore and Hong Kong are aiming to become global business hubs, attracting significant capital. Many venture funds have opened headquarters in those cities, drawn by frequent and transparent regulatory updates. Japan is grappling with nuances of IP ownership. In Korea, centralized exchanges like Upbit often outperform giants like Binance (in part driven by Korea's crypto enthusiasm and restrictions on gambling). Vietnam, while lacking substantial capital, boasts a community of enthusiasts and developers. Meanwhile, Thailand doesn't have a prominent developer or enthusiast presence, but conglomerates are keenly eyeing the Web3 sector.  While these are broad generalizations in a sense, what I found was that each of these regions and countries deserve dedicated focus and attention. Each boasts builders, capital and users all waiting to dive first into Web3.  In Singapore, I’d would have never guessed we were in the middle of a bear market. No one was talking about what the prices were for any tokens, and were instead just excitedly talking about the new projects they’re either working on or investing in. And that’s the kind of spirit we’re going to need to carry us into whenever the next bull market might be.  What Singapore taught me more than anything else was to keep following my intuition of going where the excitement is. The reality is Web3 isn’t being built in North America and Western Europe only. It’s a global movement and we’ve got to be willing to immerse ourselves in its entirety if we’re to actually win. And to do that we need to properly embrace the multidimensional powerhouse that is the APAC region.  See also: Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  There are people innovating in ways we’re not even paying attention to that are working on the exact things to help us bring this technology to the mainstream. My impression is that this space is not about isolation and superiority but instead about interconnectedness.  The future of Web3 is as diverse as the world itself. True progress in this space is not about keeping to familiar terrains or resting on past laurels. It's about bridging gaps, understanding nuances and fostering global collaborations. Returning from Singapore, I carry not just memories but a renewed commitment: to seek out innovation, to continuously learn and to champion the essence of Web3. Its universality.

20265898,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561075,1700150427,Bitcoin Bulls Are Back! Latest Signal Confirms Bullish Trend is Brewing,"Those burned by the last big Bitcoin bull run are rightfully skeptical that another one is here so soon. However, a trend strength indicator is now confirming the existence of a new bullish trend emerging. Are bulls finally back in control over crypto? Sidelined investors and traders will want to pay attention. How Technicals Could Confirm A New Bullish Trend In Bitcoin Bitcoin price is pulling back after a few failed attempts to make it though $38,000 resistance. This sudden weakness after a major breakout is both reassuring for bears and confusing for bulls. Those on the sidelines still aren’t certain what to do. But that’s what technical indicators were designed for – to eliminate noise and emotions, allowing the tools to make the decisions for you. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Remains Bullish, All-Clear Signal For Rally? According to a trend strength measuring tool called the Average Directional Index, the bullish Bitcoin trend just became official as the indicator reaches above a reading of 20. The last time that BTCUSD reached above 20 while bulls were in control was back in August 2020, prior to a 450%+ rally. For comparison sake, another 450% rally would put the price per coin around $200,000. However, each individual trend behaves differently and tops out at different ADX reading. This means anything is possible, but for now, the rise above 20 on the ADX is notable. The trend is confirmed by a reading above 20 | BTCUSD on TradingView.com How To Tell Bulls Are In Control Of Crypto With The ADX The Average Directional Index, as mentioned, is a trend strength measuring tool. It was created by J. Welles Wilder, Jr., known as the father of several technical analysis indicators. Wilder also developed the Relative Strength Index, Average True Range, and Parabolic SAR. The ADX confirms a trend is active above a reading of 20, while anything below 20 suggests a weak trend and potential sideways price action. The tool often includes two additional indicators, the DI+ and DI-, which show which side of the market is in control of price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Is Up Despite SEC Delay, Is The Spot ETF Decision Priced In Already? If the DI+ is above the DI- bulls are in control. Bears are in control if DI- is above DI+. The premise is simple and provides an easy way to visually see which side of the market is dominating. Not only are bulls in control, but the DI+ is at 36, while the highest reading back in August 2020 was 32. This means that bulls are stronger now than they were back then, and look what happened.

42392009,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzB75,1700150400,Bitcoin Is Coming to Sushi as DeFi Platform Expands to ZetaChain,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Sushi said it is expanding to layer-1 blockchain ZetaChain to add native bitcoin [BTC] support.  The addition of ZetaChain, which raised $27 million earlier this year, introduces the first native bitcoin trading in DeFi, enabling users to swap the largest cryptocurrency across 30 networks without wrapping, Sushi said in a release. Wrapping a coin allows it to be used on a different blockchain than the one it was originally issued on.  ""We're aiming to empower bitcoin holders to engage with key DeFi primitives, such as trading, along with more sophisticated applications like lending and borrowing,"" Jonathan Covey, a core contributor to ZetaChain, said in an interview with CoinDesk. By allowing bitcoin to be used with Sushi, it goes beyond its traditional use case as just a store of value, he said.  ""Bitcoin is the largest liquidity pool, and there's a lot of opportunity for developers to involve that in all sorts of Defi applications,"" Covey said.  Over the past month, bitcoin's price and trading volume have surged amid mounting anticipation that approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is coming. The ZetaChain team says they have been working on this for years, and it's just a coincidence the release is happening at the same time.  Ankur Nandwani, founder of ZetaChain and co-founder of Basic Attention Token, explained that previous attempts like Colored Coins and Mastercoin laid the groundwork for their current innovations, and noted the growing community of developers working on bitcoin utility.

42392007,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzAwp,1700147103,"UK's Proposed Crypto Rules Could Drive Away Foreign Firms, Lawyers Say","Crypto industry stakeholders have asked the U.K. government to consider extending regulatory exceptions for foreign TradFi firms to crypto.  The U.K. government has said it doesn’t plan to do so.  The tough requirements on foreign crypto firms could drive business away from the aspiring digital asset hub, lawyers told CoinDesk.  The U.K. government plans to apply its upcoming crypto rules to all firms, without exception, a decision lawyers say could drive international companies out of the market.  Industry stakeholders have called for the government – which has said it wants to turn the U.K. into a global hub for crypto – to grant some regulatory exceptions for foreign crypto firms looking to operate in the country. In particular, they want it to expand the scope of overseas persons exclusions (OPE) to include crypto.  The OPE allows some traditional financial institutions (like multilateral trading facilities that exchange financial instruments) to operate without authorization. For example, the OPE can be used when the regulated activity is done “with or through” an authorized or exempt person.  The industry requests were made during a government consultation on crypto regulation, and in its response, the government made it clear that it was not planning to extend the OPE to crypto.  Choosing not to make those exceptions, however, could stifle international firms’ willingness to operate in the U.K., said Albert Weatherill, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright during an interview with CoinDesk.  ""The removal of the OPE, I think, is a bit of a blow – in my opinion – for the industry,"" Weatherill said.  Harsher rules for crypto  The government doesn’t want to extend the OPE to crypto because ""the context of crypto asset markets is not the same as those for traditional financial products to which the OPE already applies,"" it said in its consultation response.  The government's position is that firms that deal with U.K. retail consumers should be required to be authorized regardless of where they are located.  ""It often isn’t possible to use the OPE if you provide services to retail clients,"" Hannah Meakin, also a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright told CoinDesk in a statement.  However, ""what [the government is] actually doing is blocking use of the OPE for crypto to any overseas person, even if they’re only doing institutional business,"" Meakin said. ""Perhaps the government thinks there is a different solution, such as deference or equivalence, but we are still waiting to see any details on this.""  CoinDesk also reached out to the U.K. Treasury for more clarity but did not hear back before press time.  ""They could have just narrowed the overseas persons exclusions more to say it's only available for wholesale transactions but they haven't,"" said Diego Ballon Ossio, partner at law firm Clifford Chance. ""So I think that's a missed opportunity.""  Read more: U.K. Publishes Final Proposals for Crypto, Stablecoin Regulation  U.K. regulators plan on supervising crypto in phases, starting with stablecoin legislation coming early next year with policies for the wider crypto sector coming later. It has already passed legislation that treats crypto as a regulated activity under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023.  The government wants international crypto trading firms to have to set up a U.K. branch if they want to get authorized to operate in the country, but companies may simply decide it’s ""not worth the hassle,"" Weatherill said.  ""If you are an exchange that's very active in Asia your client base is not normally here, but you've got lots of liquidity, why would you want to get a branch here if you have to go through the pain of setting up the brands, hiring people, etc..?""

The proof-of-stake blockchain platform had a notable increase of nearly 18% in value on the day after remarks made by Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, who highlighted the robustness of the Solana network. Solana has experienced a significant upward trend during the year, which some experts have interpreted as a price correction following a prolonged period of undervaluation. Related Reading: Litecoin Sustains 4-Month Run With 37% Gain, Beating Most Of Its Peers – Details According to Coingecko, there has been a significant increase of over 50% in the past week. The value of the token has experienced a significant increase of over 340% throughout the current year. Speaking on Tuesday’s “Squawk Box” with CNBC, Wood praised Solana’s impressive performance. Reflecting on the past, she noted that Ether surpassed Bitcoin in speed and cost-effectiveness, leading to its prominence. Solana Is Performing Well, ARK Invest CEO Says Wood said that Solana is “doing a really good job,” during a televised interview on Tuesday. “If you look at ether it was faster and cheaper than bitcoin in the day. That’s how we got ether. Solana is even faster and cost effective than ether.” She pointed out that individuals are willing to tolerate certain trade-offs for the sake of speed and cost, perhaps due to smaller transaction sizes or varying priorities. In her perspective, each network will find its niche, as different users prioritize different aspects of functionality. Based on data source Kaiko, there has been a consistent increase in activity on Solana throughout the year, with a notable emphasis on liquid staking protocols such as Jito. SOL market cap currently at $27.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com SOL Shines In Trading Volume Solana has emerged as the leading altcoin in terms of trading volume on exchanges accessible to users in the United States, surpassing the trading activity of Dogecoin. The native token of Solana, SOL, has seen tremendous growth over the last few months and has drawn a lot of interest from investors. It crossed $60 last week, a valuation last observed in May 2022, igniting more excitement in the community and raising expectations for an impending rally. In my opinion, I think that @Solana is going to continue to be one of the biggest movers during this current bull market cycle and I’m going to lay out some ideas for you. It’s possible that with the Ethereum ETF news that some of these ideas don’t play out, but it’s worth… pic.twitter.com/oii8vWs0W9 — Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) November 9, 2023 One cryptocurrency speculator who holds this view is Jacob Canfield, a user of the X platform (formerly Twitter).

Bitcoin NVT Ratio Has Remained Outside Red Since October According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the NVT ratio has seen a significant improvement recently. The relevant indicator here is the “NVT ratio,” which keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and daily circulation. The market cap here is naturally the total value of the asset, while circulation refers to the number of unique tokens observing some movement on the network inside a 24-hour rolling period. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Decline To $1,700 Based On This Pattern, Analyst Explains Some other analytics websites use transaction volume in place of circulation, but Santiment’s version uses the latter because the volume often contains noise that’s not relevant to the market (like relay transactions of the same coins, which are counted multiple times in the volume, but only once in circulation). When the value of the NVT ratio is high, it means that the price of the asset is high compared to the blockchain’s ability to transact coins right now. Such a trend can suggest the coin may be overvalued at the moment. On the other hand, the metric being low implies the cryptocurrency might be underpriced currently as its transaction volume is at healthy levels compared to the market cap. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT ratio over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been green in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT ratio exited the historical bearish territory back in October and has continued to be outside it in the weeks since then. The metric hasn’t exactly returned to the bullish zone proper yet; it has been more leaning towards neutral. However, the fact that the indicator has improved inside this period despite the cryptocurrency’s market cap also seeing a significant boost at the same time is certainly a positive development, as it suggests that the network activity growth has been outweighing the rise in the price. Related Reading: Chainlink Declines 6%: Rally Over Or Is There More To Go? At the current values of the ratio, the transaction activity of Bitcoin is justifying its market cap, so at the very least the asset may not be in immediate danger of a correction. This naturally means that the rally should be able to continue for a while until the ratio returns back into the bearish territory (which may not even happen if the circulation continues to improve, as it has been during the price surge so far).

20262221,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560956,1700143206,Crypto Market Cap To $25 Trillion: Cathie Wood Reveals The 2 Coins To Buy,"Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, has reiterated her bullishness on the crypto industry. In a recent interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Cathie Wood argued that the crypto industry is poised to reach a $25 trillion valuation, given a regulatory breakthrough in the US. Out of the multitude of digital assets on the market right now, Wood sees two cryptocurrencies driving much of that growth: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cathie Wood Predicts $25 Trillion Crypto Ecosystem The entire crypto industry has witnessed unprecedented growth since the middle of October. According to data from Coingecko, the entire crypto market cap has increased 35% from $1.096 trillion on October 15th to a current value of $1.4828 trillion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu: Which Meme Coin Is More Profitable For Holders? However, Cathie Wood is of the notion that this growth isn’t over, and the industry will reach a $25 trillion valuation in the near future. A $25 trillion market cap means the industry would have to grow a whopping 1,585% from its current level. Cathie Wood had predicted earlier in 2021 that Bitcoin would climb more than 10 times its value in the next five years, back when the asset was still trading around $50,000. Given that Bitcoin is now selling at around $37,000, the host of Sqwauk Box, Andrew Ross Sorkin, questioned Wood as to whether or not she still stands by her prediction. “If we have this conversation in ‘25, ‘26, are you on track?” Sorkin asked. “Yes,” Wood replied. The CEO did mention that this growth would be feasible only if there were a regulatory green light to allow financial institutions to participate in the cryptocurrency market. She also brought up the role that Spot Bitcoin ETFs will play in the projected spike, particularly BlackRock and Coinbase’s plan to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US. “I think BlackRock and Coinbase’s partnership is going to be very important,” she said. Total market cap a long way away from $25 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Bitcoin And Ethereum The Ones To Look Out For Wood specifically called out two coins to look out for as catalysts for this growth: Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading assets. This isn’t surprising, as these two assets have developed better price stability than most over the years. “Our expectation is that the crypto asset ecosystem will be dominated [by Ether and Bitcoin], and it will scale from a little more than $1 trillion today to $25 trillion in 2030 as this new world develops,” Wood explains. Related Reading: Lido DAO (LDO) New All-Time High? One Analyst’s Perfect Setup To $37 The ARK Invest CEO has been a long supporter of Bitcoin. In another interview, she said she would prefer to hold Bitcoin for 10 years over cash and gold. The CEO is also no stranger to Bitcoin price predictions, as she has previously said that BTC will go to $500,000 and even reach $1.48 million in the next seven years. According to CoinShares’ latest report, investment products tied to digital assets just reached a yearly institutional inflow of $1.14 billion. The majority of this money ($1.083 billion) has gone into Bitcoin investment products. This could signal the beginning of large-scale institutional investor participation that Wood believes will propel the crypto market cap to $25 trillion. ARK Invest is also waiting for the SEC’s green light on its spot Ethereum ETF application. Approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC is expected to propel the crypto market into the next bull run.

42392006,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzAmZ,1700143200,"Ramaswamy Shares Crypto Plan, Making Him the Only GOP Candidate Who Has One","Presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy has revealed a crypto plan that aims to protect core aspects of the industry, including software developers and unhosted digital wallets.  He says he wants to shrink the federal government dramatically and steer crypto into a clear regulatory structure that generally considers tokens to be commodities.  Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has a message for most of the employees at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if he's elected to the White House: You're fired. And everybody still left at their desks would need to back off the crypto industry, according to the candidate's new policy strategy for U.S. digital assets.  Most cryptocurrencies are commodities that are none of the SEC's business, according to Ramaswamy's crypto plan shared with CoinDesk on Thursday and set for public release at the North American Blockchain Summit in Texas. The pharmaceutical entrepreneur remains among the top four GOP candidates, maintaining 5% support in a dwindling field dominated by former President Donald Trump, according to polling data.  One issue that separates him from other candidates is his enthusiastic support of crypto as a financial innovation. He argues that the sector needs to have several freedoms protected: the right to code as a First Amendment freedom that should shield software developers from criminal or enforcement vulnerability, the right to maintain self-hosted digital wallets outside the reach of regulators and the right to know how each new virtual asset will be treated by the government.  ""A big part of what we're missing today is clarity from our regulators,"" Ramaswamy said in an interview with CoinDesk TV. ""What we're going to have is rescinding any of those regulations that are allowing the regulatory state to go after perfectly legal behavior, but by claiming that somehow it shouldn't exist because they don't like it. All of that can end on my watch.""  Firing spree  In his first day in office, he wants to fire 50% of the federal workforce, including the SEC, he said. That's more than a million workers, and he favors eventually cutting even deeper.  ""A big part of the problem is the proliferation of the size of that bureaucracy that I can shut down and rein in as the U.S. president, without having to run through Congress,"" he said.  Reducing the federal workforce has been a popular political aim that elected officials have historically found difficult to accomplish in practice, and the employment numbers have remained relatively flat, roughly the same now as they have been since the 1970s. Just on a technical level, Ramaswamy's idea would have to run a gauntlet of labor and government-employment laws and may not be entirely possible.  If he succeeds, his stripped-down regulators would be directed to enforce only crypto policies explicitly provided by Congress. And when they're evaluating whether certain assets should fall into the SEC's securities bucket or the jurisdiction of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that oversees commodities trading, he favors a process in which new assets have an initial safe harbor before being ""programmatically classified into securities or commodities.""  He tends to think most assets will fall ""on the side of commodities."" He said the current approach from regulators is flawed, and criticized the unwillingness of SEC Chair Gary Gensler to say how he thinks ether (ETH) should be classified.  ""If the head of the SEC or the commissioners of the SEC cannot instantly answer whether or not some widely used cryptocurrency or coin counts as a security or a commodity, that means the rules that we have right now are a failure,"" he said.  To some degree, that question may soon be answered by the courts before the 2024 election. In the SEC's fights against such crypto companies as Ripple and Coinbase, federal judges are already beginning to assess whether the regulator has been right in how it decides – under the so-called Howey test – which tokens and products are securities.  Shielding developers  A Ramaswamy administration wouldn't pursue software developers just for writing code, he said, citing the Tornado Cash case, and his White House would leave people's unhosted wallets alone, arguing they're vital tools of independence in the digital age.  He granted that he wouldn't be able to count on getting Congress to enact his agenda, so his plan focuses on what the executive branch can accomplish.  Presidential candidates routinely lean into rhetoric about their hypothetical first day in office, but major changes to regulatory agencies often depend on getting new leaders in. That's a political process – dependent on Senate confirmations – that has sometimes extended well into a president's first term in the White House. And even years later, some agencies – like the Biden administration's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency – may still be stuck with acting chiefs who haven't been stamped with Senate approval.  In one of Ramaswamy's policy positions, he said he'd ""order the Federal Reserve to grant stablecoin issuers the same access to Fed facilities that incumbent banks enjoy."" Even if Ramaswamy were able to get a new chairman and other governors onto the Fed board in Washington, the central bank is an independent entity that historically hasn't looked kindly on presidential intervention. A president can't order the Fed to do anything, though the White House has other ways to apply pressure to the institution.  Whether Ramaswamy's goals are realistic or not, if he or another Republican is chosen to replace Biden next year, the next White House resident doesn't arrive until January of 2025.  Meanwhile, the SEC and the Internal Revenue Service have major digital assets rule proposals poised for adoption that will dramatically overhaul how the sector does business in the U.S., and the federal courts are on the verge of hugely consequential decisions. So the U.S. crypto industry of 2025 may look far different than it does at the end of 2023.

42392016,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzBWj,1700139660,First Mover Americas: SEC Delays Decision on Hashdex’s ETF Application,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is delaying a decision on an application by Hashdex to convert its existing bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) into a spot vehicle. The agency also delayed action on Grayscale's attempt to launch a new futures-based ether ETF. Hashdex filed to convert its bitcoin futures ETF into a spot bitcoin ETF in September. Grayscale (a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group) filed for its ether futures ETF that same month. Both filings faced initial deadlines of Nov. 17 for a decision, but the SEC said it was extending this window, according to a pair of Wednesday filings.  The Philippines government said it plans to raise 10 billion pesos ($180 million) through the sale of a tokenized treasury bond next week, in the latest move by a government to embrace blockchain technology to digitize its domestic debt market. The planned sale follows an offering from Hong Kong, which issued an 800 million-Hong Kong dollar ($103 million) tokenized green bond in February. The Philippines Bureau of the Treasury intends to confirm the interest rate of the one-year bond on Nov. 20, with the issue and settlement date set for Nov. 22. It reserved the right to change the mechanics of the issue.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) bullish momentum will likely remain intact heading into the end of the year, lifting prices to the $40,000 mark, according to Markus Thielen, research head at crypto services provider Matrixport and founder of analytics portal DeFi Research. “Bitcoin will reach $40,000 – if not even $45,000 – by the year’s end,” Thielen said in a note shared with CoinDesk, citing options market positioning and dovish Federal Reserve expectations as catalysts for continued price gains. The cryptocurrency has more than doubled this year, with prices rising nearly 40% in the past four weeks alone. The recent bullish action spurred demand for call options, or derivatives giving the purchaser the right to snap up the underlying asset at a predetermined price later.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the 24-hour change in open interest in futures tied to the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market value.  Open interest in DOGE and AVAX has increased by nearly 20%, while OI in BTC has declined by 2.5%.

Bloomberg reported the change earlier, citing a statement from the regulator.  Additionally, more than 12 crypto companies are set to be fined for not complying with guidelines by a Nov. 17 deadline, Bloomberg said, citing anonymous sources who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The names of the firms were not mentioned, but don't include Binance, OKX or ByBit and some others, which will be given more time to comply, according to the report. In its email, VARA did not comment on the fines.  The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority has been run by Orser since January. He will remain fully engaged for a ""planned transition"" as a consultant, VARA said.  “It was a great experience and I’m fully vested in a consultative capacity to support VARA,” Orser said to Bloomberg. “I’m leaving to pursue other interests.” Orser did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  White has previously worked with VARA as a consultant and has headed the Cybersecurity and Digital Trust team at PwC.  In the past few weeks, Dubai has fined crypto bankruptcy claims exchange OPNX and its founders, who also set up the failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), and has awarded regulatory approvals to Crypto.com, Nomura-backed crypto custody firm Komainu, and Hex Trust, another custody firm.

20258545,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560973,1700136006,Cardano Price Poised To Rally 650% By July 2024: Crypto Analyst,"According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting a price consolidation pattern that is highly bullish. Drawing parallels to the consolidation phase of 2018-2020, Martinez points out that ADA’s current trend is a mirror image, albeit without the disastrous COVID-19 crash. “Cardano’s current consolidation trend eerily mirrors the 2018-2020 phase without the COVID-19 crash! If so, ADA could break through the $0.45 resistance around the first week of December. The upswing could send ADA to $0.75 by late December,” Martinez shared in a recent post on X. The one-week chart for ADA/USD indicates a prolonged consolidation phase spanning 665 days until July 2020, after which ADA experienced a 2,984% rally, peaking at $3.058. A significant aspect of this ascent was the retest of the upper consolidation box line, which took several months from summer 2020 to early 2021. Interestingly, after dipping back into the consolidation box, ADA initiated a second breakout that led to the massive bull run. Cardano Poised For 650% Rally Till July? Martinez’s analysis suggests that ADA could be on the brink of its first breakout from its current consolidation range of sub-$0.25 to $0.45, which has lasted for 434 days. He outlines two possible trajectories for ADA’s price in the forthcoming period, using a gray and a blue line in his chart. Related Reading: Cardano: Midnight Devnet Goes Live – Trigger For New ADA Rally? The more bullish scenario (gray line) anticipates a breakout above the consolidation zone that could catapult ADA to $0.75 by the end of December, assuming it surpasses the crucial resistance at $0.45. Following the historic pattern, a retest of the breakout mark could occur over several months. This could potentially set the stage for an explosive rally beginning in early summer 2024, leading ADA to climb approximately 650% from its present value and surge past the $3 mark. However, Martinez does not see this as the zenith of ADA’s potential growth. The gray line suggests a continued upward movement, with ADA possibly reaching $6.50 before the closure of 2024. Related Reading: Cardano October Whale Frenzy – What Lies Ahead For November? The second, more conservative scenario (blue line) posits that the Cardano price consolidation may extend until July 2024, with potential dips below $0.25 if a market crash akin to the COVID-19 downturn occurs. In this case, a breakout towards $0.75 would be expected around July, followed by a retest at $0.45 by the end of 2024, eventually propelling ADA towards the $3 threshold by mid-2025. Short-Term Price Analysis On the lower time frames, ADA is currently making strong moves. The price has successfully retested the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level ($0.341) and soared above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level ($0.37). In the first attempt, ADA failed at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level ($0.0.411). However, if this resistance is broken, the door to the yearly high at $0.463 is clearly open.

Bitcoin [BTC] and several altcoins returned to the highs they tested a week ago, reversing nearly all losses from a $300 million liquidation event on Tuesday.  Cardano’s ADA and dogecoin [DOGE] led gains among the top 10 tokens by market capitalization, surging as much as 12% without any immediate catalysts. Liquidations on the futures tracking these majors were lower than usual, suggesting the price action was primarily driven by spot buying. The CoinDesk Market Index, a market capitalization-weighted measure of the digital asset market, rose 3.8%.  Solana’s SOL climbed to as high as $67, extending a week-long ascent amid a favorable view of the blockchain and waning concerns of an impending FTX sale of the token that would release more SOL into the market.  Avalanche’s AVAX jumped 24% as developer Ava Labs said it was working with banking giant JPMorgan on an upcoming portfolio management product offered in Singapore.  Some traders pointed out that gains in the market mirrored those of traditional assets such as stocks, even as recent price movements suggested early signs of decoupling.  “Once again, the dynamics of crypto and equity markets have diverged,” FxPro markets analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in a note to CoinDesk. “However, it should be noted that this seemingly negative correlation only works in the short term, as both asset classes have been rising steadily since October.”  Kuptsikevich said that bitcoin bulls were “not giving up” as the price tested the $38,000 level again on Thursday, adding the move that likely “opened the way to $46,000.”",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC | DOGE,ADA | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/16/cardano-dogecoin-lead-price-gains-among-major-cryptocurrencies-as-bitcoin-nears-38k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72ae280e7f877c015503d0e65549a58cf333d430-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company's profitability remains a concern, with operating losses and dilution of shareholder stakes remaining the norm. Management's defensive position and potential increasing Bitcoin sales suggest a lack of bullishness on Bitcoin in the near term. Intro We wrote about Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (MARA) in May of this year when we expected more upside gains after announcing the company's Q1 earnings. Operational hash/rate growth as well as searing top-line growth were the main precursors for the buying volume gains we were witnessing in Marathon at the time. Although Marathon posted a further sequential loss in the first quarter, GAAP EPS earnings of $0.05 per share in Q1 beat consensus by $0.04 per share thus confirming the momentum we witnessed after the announcement. As a result, shares rallied almost $9 a share from our May commentary up to a July top of north of $19 a share. Since then though, the digital asset miner has given away all of its gains (and some more) as the stock currently resides just north of the $9 mark. Suffice it to say, this is a worrying sign given the price of Bitcoin is up close to 20% over the same timeframe (July 13th to November 14th, 2023). Given the large discrepancy between the performance of Bitcoin & the performance of Marathon over the mentioned period, one must think that investors are not merely looking at the company here but external factors. Fear for example could be forming due to the bitcoin halving event due next year or how the launch of the new ETF may affect the mining complex going forward. Either way, given the sustained pattern of lower lows over the past 24 months compounded by a fresh intermediate death cross (crossing over of the stock's 10-week moving average below its 40-week counterpart), we believe MARA will trade back down below $7 a share over the near-term to first of all test that multi-year supporting trendline depicted below. Marathon Digital Intermediate Technical Chart (Stockcharts.com) Sustained Lack of Profitability Forget the reported net income number of $64.1 million as this number came about as the result of a one-time gain associated with how $80+ million of debt was written off by diluting the float once more. A more accurate picture of Marathon's current profitability is its operating profit (-$15.6 million in Q3 ) and here we saw no real gains in the quarter despite sequential top-line growth of close to 20% in Q3. Suffice it to say, record Bitcoin production & growing margins mean little if shareholders' stakes are going to continue to be diluted going forward. Management tried to dress up the transaction stating that it was needed for risk-management purposes especially ahead of the halving event next year. While debt reduction on the one hand may help with forward-looking profitability (due to less interest expense), more money is also being taken out of the hands of shareholders with the hedging strategies management has begun to employ on the company's bitcoin holdings. Hedging acts like insurance in that it protects against volatility whilst also keeping upside potential intact. Irrespective of how Bitcoin trades going forward, shareholders will end up paying which is another worry if these hedging strategies continue over time on higher bitcoin holdings. Management Not Bullish On Bitcoin Over The Near Term A valid point concerning the recent convertible debt transaction was why didn't management buy bitcoin as opposed to buying back debt. Being bullish on Bitcoin, one would have thought management could have increased their Bitcoin holdings which after all is the long-term strategy of Marathon. However, the fact that management (with now a more liquid balance sheet) is talking about potentially picking up depressed assets (after the halving) means the company is taking a defensive position at least over the near term. Whether this is prudent or not (in terms of preparing for a potential bear market), it is all how the market prices in this sentiment going forward. Although liquid cash is always useful in a cash crunch, it is the company's assets that essentially grow the company . This may mean over the near that we will see further Bitcoin sales (2300 Bitcoin sold in Q3) not only to cover ongoing operating expenses but also to take some risk off the table before the halving next year. Suffice it to say, given the company's ongoing complexities and how sustained sales growth has not been impacting the bottom line thus far, there may be some validity in what consensus is predicting where it believes significant earnings growth (EPS of $3 a share) may not materialize until fiscal 2027. Conclusion To sum up, although sales keep on increasing in Marathon with exhashes hitting 23 by August of this year, shares failed to gain traction post the announcement of the company's Q3 earnings. It is fair to say that more stock dilution would not have gone down well with current shareholders which is why the company's growth curve (63%+ sales growth year over year) needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The float now stands above 220 million shares.

This move follows last week's corporate registration of that name and Nasdaq's filing of a 19b-4 with the SEC seeking approval for the spot ETF.  The price of ether [ETH] briefly jumped nearly 2% to $2,080 on the S-1 filing but has since returned to roughly its price prior to the news.  Crypto prices have been responding swiftly to ETF-related updates, particularly after court rulings against the SEC’s rejection of spot crypto ETF applications in the last few months improved market hopes for approval. A spoof iShares ETF registration referencing XRP sent the token rallying 10% before BlackRock said it was fake.  Along with several other asset managers, BlackRock currently is awaiting word from the SEC on listing a spot bitcoin ETF that could open up average investor access to the crypto dramatically.

MAS said that the plan is part of a broader set of initiatives aimed at expanding trials of asset tokenization and setting up the infrastructure for a digital Singapore dollar.  MAS’ Orchid Blueprint sets out the technology infrastructure required for digital money transfers in the future, and a new set of four trials involving industry players looks to test various components. One, looking at tokenized bank liabilities for retail payments, will first be trialed at the Singapore FinTech Festival 2023, happening now, according to the bank.  “To complement the digital money trials by the financial industry involving retail and corporate users, MAS will commence the development of CBDC for wholesale interbank settlement next year. MAS will pilot the “live” issuance of wholesale CBDCs for the first time, after previously simulating issuance within test environments,” the statement added.  MAS’ first wholesale CBDC pilot will settle retail payments between commercial banks, while future tests could look at cross-border settlements.  Singapore has already been exploring CBDCs for wholesale use. At the same time, countries have been given the go-ahead by international organizations to prepare legislation and infrastructure for issuing digital versions of fiat currencies to stay on top of payment innovation. Some countries also view CBDCs as an answer to private crypto, with MAS Managing Director Ravi Menon calling cryptocurrencies “a failure on Thursday.”  “The ‘live' issuance of central bank digital money for use as a common settlement asset in payments is a significant milestone in MAS’ digital money journey that began in 2016.

20256299,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560957,1700131508,"Bitcoin Price Is Up Despite SEC Delay, Is The Spot ETF Decision Priced In Already?","On Wednesday, the Bitcoin price rallied toward $38,000 amid expectations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approving the first Spot BTC ETF. The regulator would end up exercising its right to delay its decision further, something that has usually been bearish for the price. However, the Bitcoin price continued to show strength, suggesting that a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval might be priced into the market already. SEC Delays Spot BTC ETFs The SEC announced on Wednesday that it had decided to further delay its decision on Spot Bitcoin ETF filings; in particular, the Hashdex Spot Bitcoin ETF filing which was due to a decision or a delay on November 15. The Commission had decided that it needed more time to contemplate and thoroughly investigate the filing before giving a final answer. This means that a decision for the Hashdex ETF filing is not expected until 2024. Related Reading: ‘Vitalik Slept On My Couch & Copied My Inventions’ Ethereum Insider Says Not only did the SEC decide to delay its decision on the Hashdex Spot ETF filing, but it also chose to do so on the Grayscale Ethereum Futures filing. This comes even after Grayscale had emerged victorious over the regulator in court, which demanded that the SEC review Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF filing. Just like the Hashdex ETF, the SEC choosing to defer its decision on the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF pushes its deadline date into 2024, dashing hopes of the ETFs coming this year. However, both Bitcoin and Ethereum seemed to have shaken off this news with little to no reaction. BTC bulls hold steady | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Price Already Accounts For ETF Approvals? The approvals for a Spot Bitcoin ETF and an Ethereum Futures ETF have been anticipated by the crypto community for months now. And like any asset, investors may be becoming indifferent to whether the news affects their investment decisions or not. Such a development would mean that the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals are being priced in already, and would not have much effect on the price when they are eventually approved. However, this does not seem to be entirely the case. Related Reading: Solana Institutional Inflows Surge In One Week, Can The Price Reach $100? One example is when the price of XRP surged upon the rumors of BlackRock filing an XRP ETF, and then subsequently crashing once it was debunked. Then again, on Wednesday, as expectations around the SEC’s decision mounted, the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum rallied to $38,000 and $2,080, respectively, suggesting that investors are still expecting approval to significantly move the market. What seems to be happening is that news of delays from regulators is no longer having the bearish effects that they used to have. In this case, investors are simply not reacting to the news of a delay as they usually would seemingly because it is not widely understood that it is not the same thing as a rejection. The Bitcoin price has since retraced since hitting $38,000 but it maintains a healthy $37,000 at the time of this writing. Ethereum has also followed suit, dropping to $2,046 from its Wednesday peak of $2,080.

The BRC-20 category of tokens has added some 21% as a sector in the past 24 hours. Infrastructure token trac (TRAC) rose 93% to lead the gains, followed by meme (MEME) at 69% and nals (NALS) at 36%.  The BRC-20 standard (BRC stands for Bitcoin Request for Comment) was introduced in April to allow users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network for the first time. The tokens, called inscriptions, function on the Ordinals Protocol. That protocol allows users to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small bitcoin-based transactions.  Earlier this month, ordi (ORDI), a token tied to the Ordinals Protocol, was listed on influential exchange Binance, fueling a 50% price jump within hours. That helped spur bullish sentiment for BRC-20 tokens among traders, who hypothesized the Bitcoin token ecosystem could be a new avenue to search for profits.  Data from Ordinals tracker OrdSpace shows over 37,000 BRC-20 tokens exist as of Thursday.  Meanwhile, some popular social applications built on Bitcoin have started to introduce in-game tokens as part of attracting new users and boosting revenues.  Alpha, an application that lets X (formerly Twitter) personalities issue ‘keys’ on its app for access to a closed group chat, started to allow users to offer their own tokens to users on Wednesday.  These in-app tokens are designed to be cheaper than ‘keys,’ allowing their holders to participate in community games and lottery wheels. Alpha calls itself a “super app,” offering users a decentralized exchange, an NFT marketplace and a gaming store.  Alpha developer @punk3700 previously told CoinDesk that bitcoin’s usage in DeFi applications has so far been limited to tokenized representations of bitcoin on other chains, such as Ethereum or Solana, but that Alpha’s developers believed a gap remained for wealthy bitcoin holders to use their assets on interactive applications.",POSITIVE,BTC | ORDI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ORDI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/16/bitcoin-ordinals-token-ecosystem-emerges-as-latest-crypto-play-led-by-ordi-hype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79aaaa8fef2f20d66059b7f8f2d89c4b0540d521-2008x1130.gif?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Increased transaction activity from miners and major investors in cryptocurrency is fueling expectations of an upward trend and suggests that a huge price spike is imminent. At the time of writing, the price range for LTC is $61.50 to $74.50, up 3.5% in the last 24 hours, figures by crypto market price aggregator CoinGecko show. The crypto has so far been able to hold its ground and sustain a 37% increase in the last four months, data shows. Related Reading: If Your Bitcoin Wallet Is A Product Of The 2016 Technology, You Could Be In Trouble – Here’s Why The 100-Day Moving Average, on the other hand, is currently at $67.40, while the 10-Day Moving Average is at $73.25. These indicators suggest that Litecoin is gaining pace, with resistance levels found at $80.11 and $93.05. Litecoin hasn’t changed much in response to recent events in the crypto sector, even though it stands to gain directly. Companies like Blackrock, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Ark Invest and Fidelity recently applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Blackrock recently submitted a separate document for an Ethereum ETF. This indicates the prevailing confidence of the largest asset management firm globally in the potential approval of its Bitcoin ETF. Litecoin has emerged as one of the most active blockchains in the industry, with a solid achievement of surpassing 1 million transactions on November 14th, marking the first time the proof-of-work (PoW) network has reached this milestone. This surpasses the previous all-time high of 660,153 transactions recorded just a day earlier. Remarkably, Litecoin’s transaction activity over this two-day period has exceeded that of Bitcoin, highlighting a significant surge in LTC’s blockchain engagement. LTC market cap currently at $5.4 billion on the 24-hour chart: TradingView.com According to latest data, Litecoin has a strong daily trading volume that surpassed $612 million in the previous day. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin has shown to be resistant to manipulation. Moreover, Litecoin continues to hold its position as a cryptocurrency with significant processing power for handling heavy transactions with a relatively consistent hash rate in recent months. Related Reading: Celestia Strikes: How This Lesser-Known Coin Went Berserk With 126% Price Explosion In the meantime, there are two very encouraging signs: the miners’ accumulation of LTC, which has reached reserves of over 2.5 million, and the spike in whale transactions, which peaked eight weeks ago. But before the bulls can confidently shoot for $80 and higher, they must be able to breach the initial barrier at $78. A correction may begin if the price falls below $65; however, early support may come from the 406,590 holders who purchased 4.8 million LTC at approximately $67. Source: Santiment Meanwhile, the performance of the derivatives market presented a varied scenario. The Open Interest (OI) for Litecoin Futures on Binance exhibited a lateral movement, suggesting a decreased inclination among traders to speculate on the future price movements of the cryptocurrency. Conversely, the Funding Rate on the exchange portrayed a positive trend, signifying the prevalence of long-position traders in the market. This divergence in market indicators reflects a nuanced sentiment among participants, with some exhibiting caution and a wait-and-see approach, while others express confidence in the upward trajectory of Litecoin.

42392002,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzAS3,1700125810,"Bitcoin Could Reach $45K by Year-End, Analyst Says","Bitcoin will reach $40,000 – if not even $45,000 – by the year’s end, DeFi Research’s Markus Thielen said.  Thielen explained that options market flows and dovish Fed expectations are likely to power the cryptocurrency higher into the year’s end.  Bitcoin’s [BTC] bullish momentum will likely remain intact heading into the end of the year, lifting prices to the $40,000 mark, according to Markus Thielen, research head at crypto services provider Matrixport and founder of analytics portal DeFi Research.  “Bitcoin will reach $40,000 – if not even $45,000 – by the year’s end,” Thielen said in a note shared with CoinDesk, citing options market positioning and dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations as catalysts for continued price gains. The cryptocurrency has more than doubled this year, with prices rising nearly 40% in the past four weeks alone.  The recent bullish action spurred demand for call options or derivatives, giving the purchaser the right to snap up the underlying asset at a predetermined price later.  Per Thielen, the increased demand for the so-called bullish bets has left some market participants, mainly market makers, who are always on the opposite side of clients’ trades, exposed to continued upside in cryptocurrency. These entities will likely buy BTC and hedge themselves as prices rise, adding to bullish pressures around the cryptocurrency.  “We have two colossal options expiries on Nov. 24 and Dec. 29 with $3.7bn and $5.4 billion open interest outstanding. There are 85% more calls outstanding than puts, with the 40,000 strikes having the most significant open interest. The closer we get to $40,000, the more people will have to buy bitcoin to hedge themselves,” Thielen noted.  “There will be a broad interest in pushing prices to this $40,000 level. The odds are high that we reach this level,” Thielen added. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $37,445.  Another factor supporting the bullish case is the receding U.S. inflation rate and hopes for rate cuts or liquidity easing by the Fed.  The Fed rates by 525 basis points in 14 months to May 2023 to tame rampant inflation. The Fed’s rapid liquidity tightening disincentivized investing in risky assets and was partly responsible for last year’s crypto crash.  The inflation rate, however, has markedly slowed in recent months, having reached as high as 9.1% in June last year. Data released Tuesday showed the U.S. CPI climbed 3.2% in the 12 months through October, following September’s 3.7% rise.  Per UBS, slowing inflation means the Fed could halve the benchmark interest rate to 2.75% from the present range of 5.25% to 5.5%. Per the Fed funds futures, markets have priced in 90 basis points of rate cuts by the end of 2024.  “The U.S. inflation [headline CPI] is currently at 3.2% while interest rates are at 5.25% – a difference of 2.0%. If our inflation model is current, then this spread would even be 3.0% – so we could expect 200 basis points of rate cuts next year. This is bullish,” Thielen said.  Thielen expects inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), to drop below the Fed’s 2% target in 2024.  Lastly, the spot ETF optimism could continue to support price gains. According to Bloomberg’s analysts, there is a 90% chance the SEC will approve one or more spot ETFs before Jan. 10.

20251947,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560932,1700122822,"Bitcoin Price Soars To $38,000: 5 Major Reasons","The Bitcoin price has risen as high as $38,012 (on Binance), recording a marginally higher high. Here are the main reasons for the latest surge in BTC price. #1 Euphoria Over Potential ETF Approvals The crypto market has been electrified by the possibility of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving several spot Bitcoin ETFs. With the approval window having opened on November 9 until Friday (November 17), experts like James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas from Bloomberg estimate a 90% chance of approval for multiple filings by January 10, 2024, the final deadline for Ark Invest’s filing. Remarkably, the SEC is facing a significant deadline cluster, with three applications for spot ETFs from Franklin Templeton and Hashdex (due November 17), and GlobalX (due November 21) awaiting decisions. Amidst this tense backdrop, Hashdex emerged as the first to encounter a delay, as the SEC postponed their decision on the conversion from a futures ETF to an ETF that holds both futures and spot. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Inflows Hit $1.2 Billion In Past Month This news momentarily jolted the market, resulting in a sharp but brief decline in BTC’s price, which plummeted from $37,400 to $36,780 in a swift five-minute span. However, the market’s resilience was quickly demonstrated as Bitcoin not only recovered but exceeded its pre-announcement price within 25 minutes. #2 Unprecedented Institutional Interest In Bitcoin Institutional demand for Bitcoin has reached new heights, particularly through exchange-traded products (ETPs). The recent BlackRock Bitcoin spot ETF filing significantly contributed to this surge. “The Assets Under Management via ETPs have increased by 27,095 BTC, bringing the total to a record 204,170 BTC, equivalent to roughly 7.4 billion dollars,” reports K33 research. This trend indicates a growing institutional embrace of Bitcoin as a viable investment asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Index Enters ‘Expansion’, Echoing 400% Bull Run #3 Supply And Demand Dynamics Data from LookIntoBitcoin highlights a remarkable trend: over 70% of Bitcoin has not been moved for at least one year. “This is a historic moment that underscores the strength of Bitcoin’s tokenomics,” the data provider shared. They further elaborated, “As long as this HODL Wave continues to climb, it suggests a bullish market outlook with long-term investors showing no signs of selling their holdings. This is particularly significant considering the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event and the growing institutional interest.” #4 Liquidity Injections By The Fed Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, commented on the significant liquidity being injected into the market and its impact on cryptocurrencies. “Keep your eye on the prize. Almost $200 billion in liquidity has been added since November’s start, impacting assets like Bitcoin. This indicates a potential ongoing rise for cryptocurrencies,” Hayes stated. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the RRP and TGA dynamics in predicting market movements. #5 Inverse Correlation With The DXY The inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been a notable factor in Bitcoin’s recent price increase. As the DXY faced resistance and began to fall, Bitcoin’s value conversely increased. Crypto analyst Josh stated, “Bitcoin PUMPS while the DXY DUMPS!” At press time, BTC traded at $37,467 after failing to break out of the ascending trend channel.

42391999,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzACf,1700117790,U.S. Lawmakers Urge Treasury to Revise Proposed Crypto Tax Rules,"A group of bipartisan U.S. lawmakers have urged the Treasury to revise its proposed digital-assets taxation regime. The group is backing crypto representatives and lawyers who have called the proposed taxation scheme “dangerous and improper overreach.”  Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Patrick McHenry (R-NC) and Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y) led a group of nine lawmakers in the effort calling the tax reporting requirement “unworkable.”  “If finalized, the proposed regulation’s overly broad definition of a digital asset “Broker,” insufficient definition of a “Digital Asset,” and unreasonably short comment period threaten to prevent a large swath of the digital asset ecosystem from continuing to exist in the United States,” the Wednesday announcement said as it made public the Nov. 10 letter addressed to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Assistant Secretary Lily Batchelder.  The crypto tax rule was proposed in August, and a public comment period ended Monday after more than 124,000 comments. At a recent audio-only hearing, questions from officials to the industry revealed that the tax proposal may be “open for revision.” A final version is likely months away and could see a response to at least some of the industry’s condemnation.  The major sticking point is how the proposal captures hosted wallet providers, payment processors, some decentralized finance (DeFi) entities and others as “brokers” for tax reporting purposes. “The definition of ‘Broker’ remains too broad and would capture entities that do not possess traditional characteristics of a broker,” the letter said.

Bitcoin bounced back strongly from its battering the day before, reaching within striking distance of a new 18-month high just shy of the vaunted price target. A drop in federal interest rates, the expectation that Sam Bankman-Fried’s apology for his actions at FTX is a fresh start for the distressed sector, and the SEC’s approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) are some of the things that caused prices to rise.

Bitcoin Up 117% This Year As this developed, Bitcoin has had a significant increase of over 117% in value over the course of this year. The anticipation of the halving event in 2024 has also contributed to the increase in market optimism. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is going up as people try to make up for all the ground they lost in the recent crash, which erased up to $90 million in open interest. At $34,572, the 25-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) comes into view. BTC is trying to get back above the important support level at $36,788. BTCUSD trading at $37,379 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Despite an array of economic challenges, BTC continues to surge upward, registering a 126% year-to-date gain and options market data point to speculators angling toward the $40,000 level. With the recent price increase, the Crypto Fear and Greed index has moved squarely into the “Greed” category, indicating that market mood has improved. Source: Alternative.me In an environment characterized by an optimistic and positive outlook, Bitcoin’s momentum could be amplified and gun for the psychological turning point of $40,000. This would be a big 10% rise from where it is now. It’s getting stronger because the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is tilting northward, which shows a surge in momentum.

""There are four contenders for digital money,"" Ravi Menon said, naming them as privately issued cryptocurrencies, CBDCs, tokenized bank liabilities, and well-regulated stablecoins.  But in Menon’s opinion, cryptocurrencies have failed the test of digital money because ""they have performed poorly as a medium of exchange or store of value, their prices are subject to sharp speculative swings, and many investors in cryptocurrencies have suffered significant losses.""  Bitcoin [BTC] is up 121% this year, outperforming the S&P 500 and NASDAQ.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), he said, views well-regulated stablecoins as a promising digital currency complementing CBDCs and tokenized bank liabilities. During the speech, Menon listed StraitsX’s stablecoin and Paxos Digital's new USD-pegged stablecoin as examples.  While Singapore has a reputation as a crypto hub in Asia, regulators would much rather prefer the nation be known as a digital assets hub, something which Menon emphasized in his speech by highlighting ways the technology can be used aside from crypto speculation.  Menon mentioned how Project Guardian, led by MAS and industry partners, is tokenizing foreign exchange, bonds, and funds to enhance global liquidity, streamline cross-border transactions, and improve operational efficiency in financial markets, with trials by major global banks.  “A larger vision that is emerging is of a network of interoperable systems that allows payment, clearing, and settlement to take place instantaneously and seamlessly,” he said. “Digital assets have two critical features that can fundamentally transform the nature of financial transactions.”  A Singapore-Led Layer 1  Existing digital asset networks, Menon said, including public permissionless blockchains and private permissioned blockchains, face challenges such as lack of accountability, legal uncertainty, and interoperability issues, limiting their suitability as a global digital asset infrastructure.  In response to this, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is launching the Global Layer One (GL1) initiative.  ""GL1 is conceived as a global public good,"" Menon said. ""It will facilitate seamless cross-border transactions and enable tokenized assets to be traded across global liquidity pools while meeting relevant regulatory requirements.""  GL1 is part of Singapore's push to ensure that FinTech has a ""larger purpose"", Menon said, emphasizing that FinTech should be focused on solving real-world problems and improving people's lives.  “Together, digital assets, digital money, and a foundational digital infrastructure can help realize the vision of seamless financial transactions across the world,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/16/cryptocurrencies-have-failed-the-test-of-digital-money-mas-managing-director-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95ba481283b182f334861d781fa64429c31513b6-1261x821.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392024,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfzNH3,1700106384,"Sora's First Summit Brought Sam Bankman-Fried to Hong Kong. Now, Its Eyes Are on Taipei","Hong Kong and Singapore are the usual destinations for crypto fund headquarters in Asia.  Jason Fang, managing partner and co-founder at Sora Ventures, disagrees, picking Taipei as the place to open a new office and run the fund from and host the next iteration of its Sora Summit conference, which takes place on Dec. 16 during the Taiwan Blockchain Week.  Fang says that the only crypto companies that really only need to be in these cities are exchanges, because of the legal clarity. It's not the case for venture capital firms.  ""A lot of these exchanges looked into areas like Hong Kong and Singapore, where regulation is a lot more black and white, which actually protects the exchange,"" he said.  Taiwan doesn’t have the same sort of strict regulations and licensing.  ""In Taiwan, we don't have any restrictions in terms of any exchanges,"" Fang said. ""So you can have anything you want. There are no restrictions, and you don't need a VPN to run anything.""  It's important, according to Fang, because as a VC he is working on the bleeding edge of tech and exploring new segments that aren't yet regulated. If he were licensed under Hong Kong or Singapore's law there would be plenty of restrictions on what he can invest in, or say.  ""Sora Ventures invests in forward-thinking, innovative areas often beyond current regulatory scope – ventures that are ahead of their time and not yet on regulators' radar,"" he said.  Fang has plenty of experience in Hong Kong.  Way back in 2018 – an eon ago in crypto years – Sora Ventures hosted its inaugural Sora Summit in Macau, a Chinese autonomous territory best known for its casinos.  A young Sam Bankman-Fried was in attendance, and the conference left such a positive impression on him he canceled his return ticket to the U.S. and stayed in nearby Hong Kong to plot how to bring Alameda Research (and later FTX) to Asia, eventually opening an office for this hedge fund in the city, so he recalled in his trial.  The rest is history.  Crypto of the current year looks much different than in 2018. Beijing's attitude towards it has changed, and running a digital assets fund in Shanghai isn't the best idea from a compliance perspective.  Developing drugs on Bitcoin  Central to crypto's thesis is revolutionizing finance through decentralization, taking out rent-seeking intermediaries. DeFi, or decentralized finance, with all its flaws and epic hacks, is the synthesis of this, linking up parties and counterparties with efficiency that only smart contracts can provide.  Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, are like the corporations of DeFi – a series of smart contracts that emulate an organization with roles, titles, and rewards.  But what if these DAOs could be used to do more than create the next pepecoin?  One incarnation might include DeSci – or decentralized science – hacking together answers to medical problems by building drugs via DAOs and not big pharma.  ""Another category that we're extremely bullish on, but again, a very, very early narrative, is decentralized science,"" Fang said. ""Science, in general, is a much larger industry that can be disrupted.""  Fang's vision is to reduce the obstacles in drug development over time. Through DeSci he says the community can better reward scientists who make meaningful, real-world contributions, rather NFTs of frogs and monkeys.  The idea, he says, is over the course of the coming years, and the goal is to be able to shrink a bottleneck for drug development while compensating scientists well for their time.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is also a believer in DeSci and will be keynoting Sora Summit to promote ResearchHub, a platform he co-founded that rewards researchers with cryptocurrency for sharing their work and advancing science.  Everything is so damn centralized  Sora's DeSci ambitions, like everything else it is investing in, are based on the Bitcoin blockchain.  There's a whole DeSci universe out there, and Sora isn't the first to make moves in this space.  But it's the first to do it completely on Bitcoin.  Fang views centralization in the crypto industry as a significant risk, particularly in its potential to stifle innovation and create vulnerabilities in blockchain projects. This is a hot topic within the crypto world, with centralization risk frequently coming up in conversations around layer-1s.  Development on many layer-1s is directly funded by supporting foundations or venture studios attached to the layer-1, and if one of those vanishes the entire network would be ""f---ed"" he says.  Bitcoin, he says, will walk a very different path because miners are the ones benefiting from development in bitcoin utility thanks to the higher fees and are, in turn, funding it.  And a strong mining industry strengthens the decentralization and security of the network, like a sort of flywheel.  ""Miners are way richer than a foundation,"" he says.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/15/soras-first-summit-brought-sam-bankman-fried-to-hong-kong-now-theyve-got-their-eyes-on-taipei,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b41c29cb8e0ad10112fe0522f8ddbcb22884db3b-1383x791.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The first major resistance is near $38,800, above which the price might accelerate further higher. In the stated case, it could test the $39,200 level.
