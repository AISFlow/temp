42427115,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPfh,1477605399,The Plot Thickens As DAO Attacker Trades Stolen Funds for Bitcoin,"The DAO hacker is one step closer to turning a real-world profit.  The saga that started in June with a high-profile hack on ethereum's most notable project, took another turn on Wednesday when nearly $100,000 worth of digital currency associated with the incident was converted into bitcoin.  Given the impact of the hack on the ethereum ecosystem (it sparked weeks of debate and led to a schism among the technology's supporters), the whereabouts of the funds have long been a matter of public interest. Funds first began moving in August and were reported to be in transit again in September.  Now, analysis from Bok Consulting founder Bok Khoo indicates that a portion of the funds have reached at least one major exchange.  Khoo, who has been tracking the theft for months, first determined that the hacker split the funds into 2,333 ETC chunks on Wednesday in an attempt to sidestep restrictions imposed by digital currency exchange ShapeShift. Next, he used the ShapeShift API to determine that those funds were converted into bitcoin and are now stored at this address.  Khoo's research would indicate that this is the first time the hacker may have tried to cash out of the digital currency.  Tracking the funds  Notably, these funds represent only a small portion of what was stolen, as more than $3.5m ether classics associated with the original DAO balance are still currently stored at this address.  However, Khoo's work may soon draw to a close.  Though the journey of the funds has so far been public, they might not be traceable forever if the hacker continues to move the funds between blockchains.  Khoo mentioned that the attacker might have converted the funds into bitcoin as part of an effort to preserve his or her anonymity.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin has mixers. Ethereum doesn't have any mixers or anonymous transfers yet.""  Ecosystem impact  While the news is certainly a positive for the DAO attacker, the incident isn't likely to be relevant for blockchain development more broadly.  Ethereum's developers continue to assert that they support the move to edit the ethereum blockchain to return funds to DAO users.  At Money2020 this week, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin argued that he doesn't believe the decision for developers to intervene affects the ""immutability"" of the ethereum ledger (as suggested by ethereum classic).  ""Principles have to serve a social purpose,"" he said.  However, Buterin said that he continues to evaluate the decision, and that he now believes there needs to be ""more supporting infrastructure"" so that developers don't need to edit the blockchain when such an incident occurs.  Meanwhile, ethereum classic's supporters continue to believe their users should have confidence in any and all transactions that are valid on the ledger.  Ethereum classic supporter Avtar Sehra wrote on Twitter:  ""The DAO attacker funds may be on the move, but it's not like they can disappear – this is ETC not Accenture's 'editable blockchain.'""

42427111,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPZh,1477594992,Derivatives Giant CME Sets Launch Date for Bitcoin Indexes,"The CME Group is launching two previously announced bitcoin price indexes next month.  The exchange services operator said in a notice this week that its CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index will launch on 13th November. The CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate, according to the firm, will provide price settlement updates after 15:00 UTC each day.  The goal, CME said, is to give clients a reliable reference rate price source for ""digital assets"" or cryptographic assets that trade on a blockchain.  The benchmarks are being offered in partnership with UK-based Crypto Facilities. Announced in May, they will draw price data from bitcoin exchanges in Asia, Europe and North America.  CME has been testing the products since last month, and was expected to launch sometime in November. The move reflects a positive outlook on digital asset markets – something that CME executives have remarked on in past public appearances.

42427106,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPNh,1477588361,SBI to Launch First Bank-Backed Digital Currency Exchange,"A Japanese financial services group is set to launch the first bank-backed digital currency exchange.  SBI announced today that it is establishing a new company, dubbed SBI Virtual Currencies Co., Ltd., that will provide exchange services for as-yet-undisclosed digital currencies. The venture is being funded with 300m yen (roughly $2.8m USD at press time) in new capital, according to the firm.  While the launch date was not disclosed, SBI said it would officially form the company next month and will provide future updates as to the specific kinds of services the exchange will offer. The new company will be headquartered in Tokyo.  According to translated statements, the company said that it was moving to capture a “new value asset management opportunity”. SBI also cited positive regulatory conditions in Japan as a driving factor behind the decision to launch an exchange.  The plan represents what is perhaps SBI’s most aggressive move in the digital currency and blockchain space to date.  SBI Holdings took part in Ripple’s $55m Series B funding round earlier this, and also invested in bitFlyer, a Japanese bitcoin exchange, through its venture capital subsidiary. SBI previously announced that it was working with Ripple to create a new joint venture.  Beyond investing, SBI has worked with other financial firms in Japan to test blockchain applications in areas like currency settlement and digital banking.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stakes in bitFlyer and Ripple.

42427114,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPbh,1477583198,Australia Will Regulate Bitcoin Exchanges Under AML Laws,"The Australian government is looking to update its anti-money laundering laws to include bitcoin and other digital currency exchanges.  According to a consultation document published this week by the Australian Attorney-General’s Department, the government wants to begin drafting legislative proposals by the middle of next year. The goal is to begin finalizing that legislation in 2018.  To get there, the government is soliciting public comment on the proposal, which comes amid a broader push to revise the country's money laundering laws, between now and the end of 2017. For now, the proposal is in an early stage, with relatively few details available as to how the legislation might be drafted or what kinds of companies beyond exchange services would be covered.  The agency wrote:  “The AML/CTF Act should be amended to regulate activities relating to convertible digital currency, particularly activities undertaken by digital currency exchange providers.”  The proposed plan was released months after the Australian government released a broad policy statement on fintech, which included proposals to reduce the tax burden on bitcoin activity in the country and explore other legislative options related to the technology. At the time, the Australian Treasury indicated support for “a high-level guiding legislative framework” to govern how the country’s financial industry would integrate blockchain tech.  It also aligns with recommendations from the Australian Senate earlier this year, which called for such a move.  The plan comes as Australia’s private sector explores a range of blockchain applications, from trade finance to digital identity.

42427117,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPjh,1477573208,Blockchain Startup CoinSciences Adds 13 Members to Partner Program,"Accenture is among a group of 13 companies partnering with startup CoinSciences in an effort to get more enterprise businesses working with blockchain.  Those involved with the effort are largely existing users of the MultiChain platform, and the program formalizes that relationship. Participants include professional services firm Accenture, financial tech provider D+H and IT firm Mphasis.  According to founder and CEO Gideon Greenspan, the goal is to expand the market for blockchain consulting while at the same time improving the visibility of both its MultiChain private blockchain platform as well as the services of its partners.  He said of the launch:  ""The MultiChain Platform Partner Program allows us to formalize our relationship with these companies, offering them both marketing exposure and deep technical assistance.”  The move is a step into the public eye for Multichain, which has emerged as a notable player in the permissioned blockchain space. Those involved with the effort use the startup's platform as a basis for proofs-of-concept and prototype development alongside their respective clients.  First launching as a provider of technology for the bitcoin blockchain, CoinSciences has since shifted gears to projects like a recent cross-border proof-of-concept unveiled by Dutch multinational bank Rabobank.  In statements, partner Accenture was effusive in its praise for CoinSciences and its work, highlighting how it uses the Multichain platform as a basis for early-stage blockchain testing.  ""We’ve been working with MultiChain for nearly two years, and have seen the platform evolve rapidly to adapt to clients’ needs, including everything from building proofs-of-concept to supporting pilot projects,” David Treat, managing director of Accenture’s Financial Services blockchain practice, said in a statement.  The news highlights Accenture's growing footprint in the blockchain space. Other startups working with the services firm include Digital Asset Holdings, Blockstream and Monax.

42427112,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPXh,1477571666,S&P: Too Early for Blockchain to Impact Credit Ratings,"One of the top corporate credit ratings providers believes it's too early for the use of blockchain tech to be a factor in its analysis.  In a report published this week, Standard & Poor's (S&P) reportedly weighed in on the emerging technology, asserting that while it believes the ""market-wide adoption"" of blockchain technology remains far off, it continues to monitor its evolution due to its anticipated impact.  Notably, S&P said it does not see the use of blockchain technology to be a ratings driver ""in the near term or even perhaps in the long term"".  S&P continued:  ""But we consider that, depending on the technology's eventual application and whether it takes hold in the financial industry, it could have a substantial impact on institutions' business models.""  S&P further stated that it would consider changing this view should adoption occur faster than it ""currently expects"" or if the technology substantially impacts industry business models.

42427119,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPnh,1477544543,Investors Are Going Wild for a Digital Currency Called Zcash,"""Deafening.""  That's how market analyst Arthur Hayes describes the enthusiasm ahead of the upcoming launch of a new digital currency called Zcash – and he's not alone.  While blockchain developers have long aimed to provide users of digital currency with privacy, the technology offered by Zcash could offer its users a hereto unforeseen level of anonymity. Now, investors have taken note.  This hype is evidence in the sharp price gains that Zcash futures contracts have enjoyed ahead of the cryptocurrency's 28th October launch.  The contracts, which trade against the price of bitcoin, have surged from a low of $18 (0.027 BTC) on 15th September to a high of $261 (0.379 BTC) as of yesterday, a change that represents an increase of nearly 1,300%.  But that robust price increase has been made possible due to a non-existent supply and high demand. As Zcash does not plan to distribute coins through a public sale of its cryptocurrency to investors, that means miners and those who invested in the startup behind the technology will gain early access.  Hayes explained that enthusiasm for Zcash tokens is so high, he believes the price of 1 ZEC would pass the price of bitcoin by the year's end. The reason? Investors don't want to miss out on a rare opportunity to buy in early.  Hayes told CoinDesk:  ""No one wants to miss the next bitcoin or ether. Everyone is trying to get their hands on ZEC.""  The comments speak to the outsized gains that traders who have timed past digital currency launches have achieved.  At the time of its initial crowdsale, the price of one ethereum token (1 ETH) was roughly $0.30. Today, it's $11.93, or a nearly 4,000% increase. A similar appreciation has been observed in bitcoin, which rose from $0 to $685, and Augur's reputation toke (REP), which rose from roughly $0.50 to more than $6 today.  Vignesh Sundaresan, who co-founded bitcoin ATM maker BitAccess, also spoke to the supply and demand surrounding Zcash, as well as how expectations of its long-term value have already created a booming market.  ""Right now people have money, and they want Zcash, and there is no Zcash,"" he told CoinDesk.  Behind the hype  Yet, in a market filled with digital currencies, analysts say Zcash holds a unique promise due to the potential power of its underlying technology.  Unlike most digital currencies (which are clones of bitcoin or assets on the ethereum protocol) Zcash uses a wholly new protocol called Zerocash, which offers both anonymous digital coins called zerocoins and non-anonymous coins referred to as basecoins.  Zerocash permits anonymous transactions by harnessing a kind of zero-knowledge proof called a zk-SNARK, which allows two parties to provide each other with verified information without revealing their identities in the process.  This technology permits the creation of a secure blockchain that hides the sender, recipient and value of all transactions. Further, the information surrounding these transactions is only available to those holding a view key.  Now, users have the ability to share their view key with others if they desire. As a result, they may soon have the ability to create selective transparency on the Zcash blockchain.  By allowing Zcash users to retain their confidentiality, its developers say they have created the digital currency in a way that solves for fungibility, or the ability for one zerocoin to be truly indistinguishable from any other.  Fungibility has become an issue in the public blockchain sector, as evidenced by how it dominated conversation at bitcoin's most recent annual developer event.  The cause for concern is that if companies know the past history of a blockchain token, they may refuse the monies provided by that source. This sort of situation has already taken place with bitcoin, as some exchanges have refused to accept specific coins after notable thefts.  Potential limitations  But while the sharp gains in Zcash futures have helped to support claims about its potential, some market observers say the currency could face hurdles ahead.  Bitcoin developer and trader BTCDrak described Zcash as ""novel and highly interesting,"" but noted that the digital currency’s use of zero knowledge proofs may present challenges.  ""It's bleeding edge cryptography,"" he said, before adding that the proofs are ""very large"" and that they ""take a lot of CPU to sign transactions"". Both criticisms have led to concerns about its blockchain's eventual scalability.  Kevin Zhou, trader at digital currency exchange Kraken, also noted that investors may have reason to caution their excitement.  For example, he too called its technology ""bleeding edge"" cryptography, while noting that it remains ""untested"".  “It's the things we don't know we don't know (unknown unknowns) that could go wrong,"" emphasized Zhou, adding:  ""With every super new technology, there are always going to be risks.""  Bright horizons  In spite of the risk, digital currency hedge fund manager Jacob Eliosoff (like other traders surveyed) believes Zcash presents a unique opportunity for buyers.  But Eliosoff was cautious as well. While he said the benefit of fungibility today is ""significant,"" he argued zerocoins could become obsolete if popular digital currencies like bitcoin or ethereum solved for the problem.  Either way, all eyes will likely be on Zcash tomorrow with its official launch.  Already, miners have begun to prepare to support its blockchain, offering the ability for interested parties to purchase interests in Zcash miners.  Mining firm operator Jonathan Toomim went so far as to say he is excited for Zcash because he believes it holds the potential to undermine bitcoin's value.  ""Bitcoin had four main value propositions – anonymous electronic cash; cheap and scalable transfer of wealth; programmable money; [and] absolute scarcity as a store of wealth,"" he explained.  ""If we look at bitcoin's tech, we see that Zcash does [anonymous electric cash] and probably [cheap and scalable transfer of wealth] better than bitcoin,"" he said.  Others were less academic in their estimations of the market.  Zhou praised the digital currency, stating that he likes it far more than its competitors, telling CoinDesk:  ""Personally, I really like Zcash.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash.
