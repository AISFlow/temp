42403039,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeTum,1562707159,Facebook to Senators: Libra Crypto Will Respect Privacy,"Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus told U.S. lawmakers that the social media giant plagued by privacy scandals won't have access to personal financial information with its new cryptocurrency.  In a letter dated Monday to the Senate Banking Committee responding to pointed questions the lawmakers sent in May, Marcus took a diplomatic tone, acknowledging the panel’s concerns about data privacy and telling them:  ""I want to give you my personal assurance that we are committed to taking the time to do this right.”  A similar letter was sent to the House Financial Services Committee, the Hill reported earlier Tuesday.  In the letter, which was printed on Facebook letterhead, Marcus said personal data would not be attached to any transactions conducted on the Libra blockchain.  ""Similar to existing and widespread cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and bitcoin, transactions that take place directly on the Libra Blockchain are 'pseudonymous,' meaning that the user's identity is not publicly visible,"" he wrote, reiterating a promise Facebook has been making since it unveiled the Libra project last month.  The blockchain addresses in a transaction, a timestamp and the transaction amount will be public, but any know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money-laundering (AML) information would have to be stored by the wallet providers.  As a caveat, Marcus noted that Libra will be an open-source platform, any third party developer will be able to build their own digital wallet.  These third parties would be responsible for how their Libra wallets are built, Marcus explained, saying ""it will be the responsibility of these providers to determine the type of information they may require from their customers and to comply with regulations and standards in the countries in which they operate.""  He added:  ""Regulators of Calibra and other digital wallet services can require them to collect information about the identity and activities of their users and make such information available to law enforcement and regulatory agencies, such as for AML, CFT [counter-financing of terrorism], and sanctions purposes.""  In response to questions about what sort of consumer financial information Facebook already has, Marcus wrote that a subsidiary of the social media giant (unrelated to Libra) stores ""non-public personal financial information data,"" such as payment credentials, in compliance with existing law for transactions, but that this information is not used for advertising or for personalization.  Moreover, because the Facebook Payments, Inc. subsidiary processes these transactions, Facebook itself does not have access to any payment credentials information, though it does collect other information affiliated with a transaction, such as the merchant, the transaction amount, the date and time and the purchased good.  Church and state  The Libra Association, Facebook's governing council for its blockchain network, will have even less information than Facebook Payments does, Marcus told the senators.  Because validator nodes or wallets will process and store transactions, neither Facebook nor Libra will store personal data, he claimed.  Facebook set up a subsidiary to develop an open-source wallet for Libra, called Calibra. Marcus explained that ""Calibra will be Facebook’s representative in the Association. As a separate, regulated subsidiary of Facebook, Calibra will safeguard consumer financial data and will not use or share this data for ad targeting purposes.""  As a custodial wallet, Calibra will maintain some consumer financial data, however.  ""Aside from limited cases, Calibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook or any third party without customer consent,"" Marcus wrote.  Exceptions include data shared with law enforcement agencies or regulators in accordance with law for AML or CFT purposes, as well as in accordance with sanctions law.  ""For example, Calibra customer account information and financial data will not be used to improve ad targeting on Facebook or across its family of social media and messaging products,"" Marcus added.  In response to questions about individual credit ratings, Marcus wrote that ""Facebook does not obtain or use consumer reports or credit scores for any purpose.""  Revealed last month, Facebook’s exhaustive plan to create a widespread payments system targeting unbanked individuals was immediately met with regulatory and legislative pushback. Lawmakers and other government officials worldwide have been questioning the project, if not outright calling for a moratorium on development.  The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the project on July 16, with the House Financial Services Committee holding another the next day. Marcus will testify at both.  Marcus said in his letter Tuesday that the company had reached out to financial services firms, regulators, central banks, policymakers, treasury and finance ministry officials and other groups to discuss the project.  ""The Libra Association will work with policymakers and regulators to make sure this new ecosystem is a value-add to economies, that consumers are protected, and that the role of government oversight and central banks is appropriate. The Association is fully committed to advancing the global dialogue on how blockchain and cryptoassets should be regulated."" he wrote.

On July 2, the firm filed a trademark application on that describes an electronic wallet that may contain capabilities for cryptocurrency. Additionally, LG CNS, the firm’s IT subsidiary, announced that it will add food distribution services to it’s Monachain distributed ledger, according to ZDnet. While a registration doesn't define a company's strategy it is an interesting insight in the electronics giant's future plans.  Through a partnership with IT service provider SayIT, LG intends to track food being served in Korean school cafeterias. The service will provide transparent access to ""production, processing, distribution, acquisition, and consumption"" data for agricultural products.  The firm said the initiative is aimed at improving students' health, and will collaborate with local governments to make the data publicly available.  LG CNS began developing its blockchain in 2017 using R3’s distributed ledger software, Corda.  Electronic Wallet  ThinQ Wallet, registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, will provide transaction, brokerage, and settlement services for a number of devices including mobile phones and computers.  The registration also lists use cases for blockchain, cryptocurrency, and the “issuance of cyber money,” though the majority of listed applications involve traditional credit and banking services.  ThinQ is a trademark currently used by LG to indicate products integrated with AI.  LG has successfully tested a number of blockchain applications in the past two years.  The firm designed a pilot in September for a blockchain-based international payments mobile service under its cellular carrier LG Uplus. In June, LG signed on with pharmaceutical firm Celltrion and UnionBank to council the Klaytn blockchain launched by South Korean messaging app giant Kakao.

""Atari: Fistful of Quarters” will allegedly be the first motion picture to undergo the process of crypto-securitization in an effort to raise as much as $40 million for a biopic of Atari founder Nolan Bushnell.  Bushnell founded Artari in 1972 after launching a clone of a game called Spacewar. The first coin-op and home video game consoles - primitive as they were - set the stage for the golden age of gaming.  “Our goal is to apply blockchain technology to capital markets and every industry that can benefit from the platform we have built. The Atari movie is the perfect project to lead the way for the tokenization of the movie business,"" said tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi, in a statement. His colleague Patrick M. Byrne, Director & Chief Executive Officer of tZERO’s parent company, Overstock.com said this partnership will ""bring much needed transparency and accountability"" to Hollywood.  The tokens, dubbed Bushnells, will be developed by tZERO and sold by Vision Tree. A share of the film’s profits will also go to token holders, according to the press release.  Bushnells also enable owner participation in the film’s production and distribution by voting on the trailer and casting decisions.  tZERO was recently valued at $1 billion dollars by GSR Capital following an equity investment of $5 million.

The first loan issuing 1 million new DAI stablecoins was made in late June by the seventh-largest collateralized debt position (CDP) in the MakerDAO system. CDPs are essentially programmatic loans taken out by users who lock-in holdings of ether (ETH) to draw out subsequent holdings of DAI from the MakerDAO system.  The foundation maintaining the system says the recent upswing in ETH prices is making large loans more common.  ""I would not be surprised to see a $3 million mint by end of the year,"" Joe Quintilian, head of proprietary trading at the MakerDAO Foundation, told CoinDesk. “Minting high dollar amounts has been steadily increasing over the past year.""  The total supply of DAI now stands at roughly 91 million and may soon exceed a record high of 95 million. But – with a debt ceiling of 100 million DAI currently in place – that growth is not without potential repercussions.  ""I think DAI supply will continue to grow as markets stay bullish,"" Michael McDonald, creator of DAI analytics site mkr.tools, told CoinDesk. ""If it starts hitting that 100 million and people still want to draw more DAI, you may have to really increase the stability fee. It all depends on what the governance decides to be about that.""  Stepping back, the MakerDAO ""stability fee"" is an interest rate that all users are required to pay back into the MakerDAO system once they close out their DAI loans. The stability fee, currently at 18.5 percent, plays a crucial role in staving off surplus demand and restoring DAI's dollar valuation.  ""My guess is as the price of ETH has gone up significantly over the past few months, CDPs are heavily over-collateralized so owners now feel comfortable drawing out more DAI against their ETH collateral,"" McDonald said.  Time to raise the ceiling?  Given the bullish market trend, McDonald tells CoinDesk that MakerDAO token holders may soon have to consider increasing the hard supply cap on DAI, which currently sits at 100 million.  This will all depend, McDonald says, on when multi-collateral DAI is introduced into the MakerDAO system.  With multi-collateral DAI, users will be able to mint new DAI tokens by locking holdings of alternate cryptocurrencies beyond just ETH. Each cryptocurrency will have its own unique supply cap, called a ""debt ceiling,"" which ensures sufficient diversification of assets backing DAI's value.  ""It depends on how far along multi-collateral DAI is,"" said McDonald. ""If multi-collateral DAI is not going to launch until Q4 [of this year] then I'd be all for raising the debt ceiling to allow for some amount of growth in the meantime.""  But ultimately, this decision – like the ones to increase the stability fee – are in the hands of the voters of the MakerDAO system, those who hold MKR governance tokens.  Since the MakerDAO lending protocol went live on the ethereum blockchain in 2017, the DAI supply has seen strong upward growth for nearly a year and a half. So much so that beginning in January the stablecoin began trading at market prices below its targeted dollar valuation.  Over the course of four months and eight consecutive raises, the stability fee went from 0.5 to 19.5 percent. These increases did prove to retract DAI supply and raise stablecoin prices back to the dollar valuation.  More recently, however, DAI supply looks to be back on the incline and DAI prices as of this week are hovering at a $0.99 valuation across major cryptocurrency exchanges.

McAfee declared his intentions soon after Cuba's government officials revealed their intention to develop a cryptocurrency to be used to avoid economic sanctions imposed by United States.  According to Reuters, McAfee assured that the cryptocurrency project is not only viable, but rather simple. So simple, in fact, that he even offered his guidance pro bono.  “It would be trivial to get around the U.S. government’s embargo through the use of a clever system of currency. So I made a formal offer to help them for free on a private channel... through Twitter,” he said.  The use of cryptocurrency to get around US sanctions is an idea that seems directly inspired by Venezuela's efforts to create its own digital currency for trade. However, McAfee blames past failures on false expectations .  “You can’t just create a coin and expect it to fly,"" he said.  According to the tech guru, the key to Cuba's successful development of a cryptocurrency is to adapt it to its reality as a country.  ""You have to base it on the proper blockchain, have it structured such that it meets the specific needs of a country or economic situation,” McAfee said.  A Fair Trade  McAfee's interest in helping the Cuban government develop a cryptocurrency is based on the programmers own ideals of freedom and his time spent in Havana.  McAffee also plans to run as a Libertarian Party presidential candidate for the 2020 US elections from the island and will extend his tourist visa indefinitely. It hasn't been confirmed if Cuba's government has accepted McAfee's proposal.

42430702,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMx9Fh,1562678138,Kakao Claims Its New Blockchain Is 150x Faster Than Ethereum,"South Korean messaging app provider Kakao has claimed that its recently launched Klaytn blockchain network is up to 150 times faster than ethereum.  As reported by The Korea Herald on Tuesday, Kakao's blockchain subsidiary GroundX held a press conference in the South Korean capital Seoul, saying that, its offering provides a transaction throughput of 3,000 per second, compared to ethereum's 20 transactions a second, the report indicates.  Further, while Klaytn can mine a block in as little as a second, ethereum takes around 15 seconds.  Ground X CEO Han Jae-sun said:  “I believe it would be the initial version of a mobile [blockchain] service. With the reduced response time, many projects that we believed unfathomable could eventually come true.”  Ground X announced the Klaytn mainnet launch on June 27, saying that the blockchain is aimed to bring about mass adoption of blockchain services.  According to its white paper, Klaytn has been designed with a hybrid approach that adopts the concepts of consensus nodes (CNs) and ranger nodes (RNs) to achieve both scalability and transparency.  CNs are invited partners on the network that together form a private blockchain to batch and confirm transactions by running a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm. Anyone from the public can connect to the network and participate as a RN, who are assigned the duty of double checking blocks that have been propagated by CNs.  With the announcement, GroundX said that major firms such as LG had joined a governing council for Klaytn, and that a number of projects were already building with the new blockchain and will be released by the end of July.  Correction (July 13): Due to an error in reporting by The Korea Herald, this article misstated the transaction throughput of Klaytn as 15x. It is actually 150x, according to the company. This has now been corrected.

42430698,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMx97h,1562677203,"Multicoin, Binance, Coinbase Invest in Startup Keeping Private Keys Secure","Blockchain startup Torus has an impressive cap table.  The private-key management firm recently closed a $2 million seed round led by Multicoin Capital. The fundraise also saw participation from notable investors like Coinbase Ventures, Sixth Horizon, Accomplice and Terminal. Binance Labs invested $500,000 in the round.  Torus  , says Multcoin's Kyle Samani, is solving “one of the most critical problems slowing the adoption of web3.” That is, public- and private-key management.  Blockchains are built on the backbone of public-key cryptography. Users are identified and authenticated on a blockchain through a set of “keys” represented as a randomized string of alphanumeric characters.  For bitcoin, the key that allows a user to actually spend any amount of value on the network is called the private key. It is imperative that users protect and keep secret their private keys or else risk having their funds spent by another user.  For ease and simplicity, many users simply cede management of their private keys to a larger entity such as a cryptocurrency exchange. However, many of these exchanges have faced hacks resulting in the loss of millions of dollars of users’ funds.  “When we tried to introduce the crypto ecosystem to other friends ... we found they were really amazed by the concept of decentralization,” Torus CEO Zhen Yu Yong told CoinDesk. “But when it came to actually starting to use [decentralized applications] and interacting with the blockchain itself, it was quite a struggle to get them to start.”  Yong added:  “They had to understand a lot of difficult concepts such as public/private keypads. ... We just wanted to abstract that all away for new users so they could be left with a simple, secure, as well as, seamless solution.”  Torus presents key management solutions for users in which any sensitive information held by the startup is split across multiple computer servers, a process known as sharding. In this way, even in the event of security breach, no attacker can easily reconstruct users’ private keys.  In addition, Torus currently offers users on-ramp integrations “indistinguishable from the login flow for web2 apps,"" such as Google and Facebook, according to the company.  The developer team behind Torus received the initial investment from Binance Labs last September. Torus launched a beta testnet earlier this year for ethereum users and is presently working towards building tools for other major blockchain platforms, including Tron and EOS.

42430715,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMx9bh,1562670051,Bitcoin Price Eyes Move Above $13K as Dominance Rate Hits 2-Year High,"View    Bitcoin's violation of recent bearish lower highs with a move above $12,061 has opened the doors for a retest of $13,880.  Prices reinforced the bull breakout with a successful defense of the former resistance-turned-support of $12,061 soon before press time.  Bitcoin's dominance rate has spiked to 27-month highs, backing the uptrend in prices.  A high-volume UTC close below $12,000 would abort the bullish view.      Bitcoin’s break above a key price hurdle looks to have set the tone for a retest of recent highs above $13,800.  The top cryptocurrency bu market cap printed a UTC close above $12,061 on Monday, invalidating a bearish lower highs pattern created on July 4, according to Bitstamp data.  Further, with Monday’s close, BTC cemented the bullish view put forward by the strong dip demand below $10,000 observed a week ago.  More importantly, the latest breakout looks sustainable, as bitcoin's dominance rate (percentage of the market in relation to other cryptocurrencies) has ticked up to 64 percent, the highest level since April 2017, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  A rise in price accompanied by a surge in the dominance rate indicates that investors are pouring money into the bitcoin market for a long haul and not merely to fund purchases of relatively cheap alternative cryptocurrencies.  Put simply, rise in dominance adds credence to the upward trend in prices. As a result, doors look open for a rise toward the recent high of $13,880.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $12,600 on Bitstamp, representing 7.55 percent gains on the day. Prices hit a high of $12,883 earlier on Tuesday.  Daily chart  Bitcoin violated the bearish lower-highs pattern with a close above $12,061 yesterday on the back of an uptick in buy volumes (green bar).  The 14-day relative strength index is currently holding well above 50, indicating bullish conditions.  Further, the Chaikin money flow indicator, which takes into account both prices and trading volume, continues to print positive numbers – a sign of sustained buying pressure.  BTC could rise above $13,000 in the next 24 hours and extend the gains toward $13,880 (June 26 high) in the short-run.  Hourly chart  BTC dived out of the ascending channel soon before press time, establishing a bearish lower high at $12,700.  Prices, however, soon bounced up from the former resistance-turned-support of $12,061, keeping the bulls in the game.  A break above $12,700 would further strengthen the bull grip and allow a rally to levels above $13,000, as suggested by the daily chart.  The bullish view, however, would be aborted if prices close today below the former resistance-turned-support of $12,061.

42430700,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMx9Dh,1562664601,Bitcoin's Mining Difficulty Just Posted Its Biggest Increase Since 2018,"Bitcoin mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards on the world's first blockchain network – has posted its largest two-week increase in 12 months.  According to BTC.com data, mining difficulty reached 9.06 trillion (T) at block height 584,640 around 9:17 UTC on July 9, surpassing the previous record of 7.93 T by 14.23 percent. This was the strongest growth in any two-week period since August 2018 – a sign that competition among miners is not only intensifying but doing so at an accelerated rate.  The bitcoin network is designed to adjust its mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks (roughly 14 days) based on the participating mining power in each cycle, in order to ensure the block-producing time at the next period stays at about every 10 minutes.  When there are fewer machines competing to solve bitcoin's hash function to earn newly created bitcoin, the difficulty will fall; when more players jump in, it rises.  Competition right now is so fierce, mining difficulty has leapfrogged the entire range of eight trillion to break the threshold of nine trillion. The estimated difficulty by BTC.com at the next adjustment period could be as high as 10.35 T, which would be another 14.17 percent increase.  Similarly, the amount of computing power devoted to securing the bitcoin network has also logged the biggest growth of any two-week difficulty adjustment cycle since August 2018, based on BTC.com data and CoinDesk's calculations.  Enthusiasm for bitcoin mining has pushed the hash rate to as high as 74.5 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s) as of July 5, in line with predictions by mining farms in China that have been plugging in machines to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power during the rainy summer season.  The total hashing power is expected to continue rising as the peak rainy season is still months away in southwestern China, an area that is estimated to account for half of bitcoin's global mining production.  Boom and bust  Bitcoin mining difficulty took a significant hit last year amid the market downturn. It dropped as much as 30 percent from October to December and only got back to the previous high last month.  That said, the increases in bitcoin's hash rate and mining difficulty have not yet caught up with the pace of bitcoin's price jump, at least not as much as they did in the bull run during the second half of 2017.  According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index data, bitcoin's price surged by 400 percent from around $4,000 to nearly $20,000 between June and December 2017. During the same period, the network's computing power grew by at least 200 percent.  However, while bitcoin's price has shot up to as much as $12,000 in June – a 300-percent jump since it fell to $3,000 early this year – the network hash rate has only increased by 100 percent over the same period.  The reason for this lag is an insufficient supply of new bitcoin mining equipment to meet the market's demand since major miner makers are hitting a bottleneck of production capacity resulting from a limited supply of chips from semiconductor vendors.

42430707,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMx9Nh,1562659245,Safety Without Silos: Why Businesses Will Learn to Love Public Ethereum,"John Wolpert leads Web3Studio, a unit of ConsenSys. Before joining ConsenSys in 2017, he served as the global product executive for IBM Blockchain and co-founder of Hyperledger.      In 2015, the Ethereum public mainnet launched, followed by a raft of private blockchain offerings targeting the enterprise. This opened the floodgates on companies prioritizing collaboration, funding long-overdue digitization efforts, and extending business processes across corporate borders.  Today, a new epoch of system integration is underway. However, efforts to make blockchain technology enterprise-friendly split the community into two camps: public networks versus private networks. The dichotomy was wrong-headed from the start, making it easy to believe that public blockchain networks shouldn’t be used in confidential business operations and that private networks were safe and secure.  The first belief is wrong, and the second is dangerous.  It’s true that the consensus mechanism of a private blockchain can make it difficult to tamper with information, assuming that the companies maintaining the ledger don’t share a common motive to alter records. But such private blockchain networks are not particularly secure against data breaches, because they must protect many identical copies, each controlled by a different company. That’s a hacker’s dream. This can be managed, and the risk can be worth it, but to say that private blockchains are secure is specious.  Hacking notwithstanding, not everyone in a consortium should know about every transaction or agreement between others operating in that network, even among a tight group of permissioned partners. Private platforms like Hyperledger Fabric try to compartmentalize information inside a permissioned network, but it’s not what blockchain technology was designed to do.  Consequently, they add an immense amount of complexity, and complexity is the enemy of security. The good news is that there is a way to use blockchain technology that reduces system integration complexity, increases security, and improves both resilience and interoperability. And this approach doesn’t require companies to replace internal systems or build “consortium blockchains” that recreate the same old information silos that already plague the business.  Enterprise blockchain must face the following conundrum: on the one hand, we want information transparency across business networks to improve outcomes like food safety and reduce fraud, but on the other hand, we need compartmentalization of information to ensure privacy and encourage companies to participate.  A Common Challenge  This puzzle appears in every kind of business. Advertising. Finance. Manufacturing.  Consider a case from the automotive industry. Say a car part fails and causes a crash. It turns out that the part was made by a machine that happened to malfunction during only one production run. The run made just 50 parts, twenty of which were sent to the maker of the crashed car and the remainder to another car company. It would be great if the investigator of the crash could instantly access the data from the machine that made the parts, know the information had not been altered, and trace the 50 bad parts to each installed car.  That’s a 50-car recall, not a million-car recall. But there’s a problem. The parts manufacturer will not put its internal machine telemetry in a database controlled or viewable by anyone else, certainly not one accessible to competitors. And even if one car maker set up a database and convinced suppliers to use it, the other car maker wouldn’t use it.  A third party that everyone trusts to store their data, manage workflows, and compartmentalize information could handle this scenario. The problem is that it gives someone a lot of power to soak the firms for fees. And inevitably more than one such provider pops up, usually generating incompatible factions that foil standardization.  We could put the whole thing on a blockchain, but then everyone would see all the data, or at least everyone would be executing the code that embodies business agreements between the different companies. And that can give away sensitive strategies, tactics and relationships to other network participants to exploit, even if the information itself is encrypted.  In the end, what makes sense is letting each party manage their own private systems with their own private data, running their own protected functions – but integrating them in such a way that allows them to coordinate where appropriate, quickly track down problems, and ensure everyone is playing by the rules.  To integrate different systems this way requires a common frame of reference. We need a way to pass messages between functions running on separate systems, so that they can work together without having to expose the underlying data or business logic indiscriminately. Using a common frame of reference isn’t a new idea. Publishing messages to a common bulletin board, a magic message bus, is a classic pattern for making system integration more manageable and resilient.  You can buy expensive middleware to do the job right now. And you can pay a system integrator a king’s ransom every time you need to connect one company or department to another with it.  What’s new is the notion of using the Ethereum mainnet as a global integration hub serving systems that work together without revealing private data or confidential business logic, even to partners. One might be tempted to use a private blockchain network for this. But as Paul Brody, global leader of blockchain for Ernst & Young, explains, this is a bad idea for real business:  ""One day you get a call from a very large buyer saying, 'Would you like to join my private blockchain?' You say, 'Okay.' And then you get the same call from your wholesaler, your suppliers, your shipper, your insurance company and maybe even your bank...or several of each of these! Suddenly you are spending all your time – and a lot of money – juggling dozens of blockchains. When the next partner calls, you say, 'Just fax me the order.'""  Brody asserts that this is why the enterprise blockchain consortium approach doesn’t scale organizationally, and his argument makes a lot of sense. It looks like the same siloed mess we’ve lived with for decades.  But by using a mainnet like Ethereum 2.0, we will be able to treat business integrations more like workgroups and channels on Slack: easy to create, combine and recombine. Your SAP inventory management system, your supplier’s JD Edwards ERP system, and your fancy fintech partner’s blockchain thingamajig can work together in a consistent, repeatable manner without having to set up new infrastructure to accommodate each set of partners.  Who's Working on It  Venerable firms like Microsoft and Ernst & Young, and projects like Chainlink and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance’s Trusted Compute working group, are already ahead of this.  The recently released Trusted Compute specification will, for example, allow an automobile safety inspector to query a parts manufacturer, spot a problem with a production run, and be confident the answer is based on authentic information generated by systems free from tampering – without forcing the company to expose their internal data.  The Nightfall project, developed by Ernst & Young, uses the mainnet to post cryptographic proofs for system integration and compliance. The fact that a 150-year-old accounting firm like EY is using the public mainnet this way speaks volumes. And it puts the lie to the notion that you can’t use the mainnet in business. What company could be more cautious about managing private, confidential information than one of the Big Four accounting firms?  In 2015, the enterprise had no real interest in blockchain. Then suddenly, it decided to use private versions of it for jobs that often were a better fit for traditional systems. Now, with the benefit of almost five years of experience, smart businesses are discovering that the real job is putting an end to a half-century of brittle, balkanized and bespoke system integration.  And the right tool for that job is the mainnet.

As part of the NYAG's ongoing investigation into Bitfinex and Tether, the NYAG filed a Memorandum of Law in Opposition, an affirmation, as well as a total of 28 pieces of exhibits on July 8, with the New York Supreme Court.  The NYAG said in the new documents:  ""Even a cursory examination of the facts gathered to date in the OAG' s investigation shows that Respondents have extensive and consistent contacts to New York concerning the matters under investigation.""  The filings come with various exhibits to showcase Bitfinex's and Tether's interactions with New York residents over a period that was longer than the two previously claimed.  CoinDesk reported in May that Bitfinex and Tether argued with the judge in the New York Supreme Court that the case should be dismissed since they “have nothing to do with New York investors"" and ""the businesses do not allow New Yorkers on their platforms and do not advertise or otherwise do business here.""  However, the NYAG indicated that based on the series of evidence gathered and provided to the court, Bitfnex had customers log in to its platform as recently as Dec. 18, 2018.  Further, Exhibit (S) - H also showed the correspondence between Bitfnex and the billionaire hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz's Galaxy Digital to onboard the latter as Bitfinex's customer in October 2018.  In addition, the NYAG provided exhibits to show that Bitfinex held accounts with two New York banks – Signature Bank and Noble Bank – and at least ""one other New York-based financial institution during the relevant time period, which they used to transfer money to and from clients of the Bitfinex and Tether platforms.""  The NYAG added:  ""Respondents have repeatedly engaged New York firms to assist them in their business objectives, including to make statements to the markets about the operation of the Bitfinex trading platform and the cash backing of tethers; and as recently as 2019, Respondents opened a trading account with at least one New York-based virtual currency firm.""  In the Memorandum of Law in Opposition, the NYAG also took aim at Bitfinex's recent issuance of the LEO exchange platform token.  ""Respondents' recent 'initial exchange offering,' for instance, has every indicia of a securities issuance subject to the Martin Act, and there is reason to believe that the issuance is related to the matters under investigation,"" the NYAG said.  The NYAG first filed a complaint against Bitfinex and Tether in April 2019, alleging that Bitfinex had covered up the loss of more than $850 million by borrowing from Tether's reserves.  Shortly after the NYAG filed the complaint, Bitfinex conducted an initial exchange offering for its own LEO token and one shareholder of the firm claimed it successfully raised $1 billion with commitment from private investors.
