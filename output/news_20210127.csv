42385799,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOK9H,1611787477,El camino de Ethereum hacia los USD 2.000: tres razones para ser optimista,"Ethereum, la criptomoneda con la segunda capitalización más grande del mercado, tocó un nuevo máximo histórico al alcanzar los USD 1.439,33 el 25 de enero. Es la primera vez que este activo digital supera el techo de los USD 1.400 desde el 13 de enero de 2018, y sus retornos acumulan un 76% en lo que va del año, 19 veces más que los de Bitcoin en 2021. A pesar de haber experimentado una corrección transitoria, sigue siendo uno de los activos de mayor rendimiento entre los 10 principales.      Aunque no han habido factores evidentes que se puedan considerar fundamentales para impulsar la subida a un nuevo máximo histórico, Ether había estado a punto de superar su precio récord durante más de dos semanas, después de escalar hasta USD 1.350 el 10 de enero. El crecimiento exponencial del mercado de las finanzas descentralizadas, conocido en inglés como DeFi — cuyos protocolos, al día de la fecha, albergan criptoactivos por un valor de alrededor de USD 24.000 millones—, fue, probablemente, un factor que contribuyó al impulso alcista de este activo. Ahora, con Ethereum acercándose a un territorio inexplorado, todas las miradas estarán puestas en que la segunda criptomoneda más relevante del mercado alcance su próximo hito importante: la marca psicológica de los USD 2.000. Esta legendaria línea se encuentra a más de un 50% de distancia del precio actual (al cierre de esta edición), pero hay tres acontecimientos importantes programados para 2021 que podrían ayudar a que esto sea posible.    Read this article in English.  1. Los futuros de Ethereum de CME    La mayor plataforma de derivados financieros del mundo, la Bolsa Mercantil de Chicago —CME, por sus siglas en ingles—, anunció públicamente el 16 de diciembre sus planes de lanzar futuros en Ethereum hacia el 8 de febrero, si logra recibir la aprobación reglamentaria de la Comisión de Negociación de Futuros de Productos Básicos de Estados Unidos (CFTC, por sus siglas en inglés). Los derivados financieros son básicamente contratos comerciales que permiten a los inversores apostar por el precio futuro de un activo subyacente sin la necesidad de poseerlo.      Este nuevo producto financiero de liquidación en efectivo — lo cual significa que cualquier ganancia obtenida se pagará en dólares estadounidenses en lugar de Ether— llega tres años después de que la bolsa lanzara los futuros de bitcoin, que en la actualidad son el producto de futuros de bitcoin más negociado en el mundo y representan más del 20% de todos los contratos abiertos.      En definitiva, la llegada de los futuros de Ethereum aportará una mayor madurez al mercado de criptomonedas y, aunque los futuros no se distribuyen físicamente, una mayor liquidez. Esto es beneficioso porque brindará a los inversores institucionales, en especial, la oportunidad de cubrir posiciones al contado, lo cual reduce el riesgo en general y a su vez convierte a Ethereum en una inversión mucho más atractiva.    2. Retiro de Ether y comisiones predecibles    Cualquier acción llevada a cabo en las aplicaciones descentralizadas (dapps) o protocolos construidos sobre Ethereum es concebida como una transacción, la cual requiere una tarifa adjunta para incentivar a los mineros a procesarla. En la actualidad, estos valores se determinan mediante un sistema de subasta en el que los usuarios que asignan las tarifas más altas a sus transacciones son quienes logran que los mineros las procesen más rápidamente. Esta dinámica plantea una serie de inconvenientes, concretamente: tarifas imprevisibles y a menudo excesivas durante los periodos de mayor congestión. En la red esta aglomeración se genera cada vez que hay un pico de actividad comercial, como cuando el precio de Ethereum cambia bruscamente y miles de operadores quieren entrar o salir del mercado al mismo tiempo.      EIP 1559 es una propuesta de mejora de Ethereum presentada por el cofundador del proyecto Vitalik Buterin junto con los desarrolladores Eric Corner, Ian Norden, Rick Dudley y Matthew Slipper. Ésta pretende implementar cambios en la forma en que las tarifas de las transacciones de Ether son presentadas a los usuarios así como en la gestión de la oferta de Ethereum. EIP 1559 sugiere desechar el actual sistema de precios por subasta y sustituirlo por uno determinado algorítmicamente, llamado BASEFEE. Éste busca introducir una tarifa uniforme en todas las plataformas y servicios que funcionan sobre Ethereum, la cual aumente y disminuya en función de la actividad de la red. Tal cambio implicaría que dejaran de existir discrepancias de tarifas entre billeteras, protocolos y plataformas de intercambio (exchanges) compatibles con el token ERC-20.      Sin embargo, EIP incluye la opción para que los usuarios den una propina a los mineros si desean que sus transacciones sean procesadas más rápidamente. La segunda función del EIP 1559, y la que probablemente tendrá el mayor impacto en el precio futuro de Ethereum, es la introducción de la opción de retirar (burn) Ether. Retirar (NdT: o “quemar”, si se usa la traducción literal del término en inglés, burn) significa eliminar completamente la existencia de tokens, provocando una reducción de la oferta en circulación. EIP 1559 planea retirar el BASEFEE, de manera que la gran mayoría de Ether utilizado como forma de pago de las tarifas originadas en el procesamiento de transacciones sea destruida en lugar de ser dada a los validadores de la red.      El objetivo es que esto fomente la deflación constante del Ether, lo que a su vez debería ayudar a reforzar los precios con el paso del tiempo. Se prevé que el EIP se ponga en marcha en algún momento después del hard fork de Berlín, que podría ocurrir a partir de febrero.    3. Lanzamiento de la fase 1 de Ethereum 2.0    Ethereum está en proceso de pasar de ser una blockchain basada en Proof-of-Work a una que opere bajo un mecanismo de consenso conocido como Proof-of-Stake, con el propósito de convertirse en una plataforma más rápida, eficiente y escalable. La actualización de Ethereum 2.0 consta de cuatro fases distintas —fase 0, fase 1, fase 1.5 y fase 2—, cada una de las cuales sienta las bases técnicas de la siguiente hasta llegar a completar la fase final. El 1 de diciembre de 2020 se puso en marcha la fase 0 y con ésta la implementación de la Cadena Beacon, una nueva capa de blockchain que coordinará la actividad entre las cadenas cortas (shard chains) de Ethereum (NdT: sharding es un método propuesto para dividir la infraestructura de Ethereum en piezas más pequeñas con el objetivo de escalar la plataforma para que soporte más usuarios).      La fase 1 es la siguiente en el desarrollo de Ethereum y supondrá el lanzamiento de 64 shard chains. Toda la actividad de transacciones en la red, eventualmente, se dividirá y procesará en estas blockchains separadas. Mediante este nuevo sistema los intercambios no tendrán que ser validados por toda la red sino por solo una shard chain, lo que reducirá en gran medida los tiempos y permitirá el manejo de volúmenes significativamente mayores sin que se genere el nivel de congestión que se da en la red actualmente.      Aunque no hay fecha confirmada para el lanzamiento de la fase 1, se espera que llegue en algún momento de este año.

Chairman Jerome Powell said he doesn’t want to put a timeline on tapering the U.S. central bank’s $120 billion-a-month in asset purchases.      “In terms of tapering it’s just premature,” Powell said. “We said we’d want to see substantial, further progress towards our goals before we modify our asset purchase guidance. It’s just too early to be talking about dates. We need to see actual progress.”    Read more: Federal Reserve Holds Rates, Asset Purchases Steady as Economic Activity Moderates    A little bit of inflation in 2021 would be welcome news for the Federal Reserve if it means fewer jobs are permanently lost, Powell added.      “I’m much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people’s careers and lives that they built because they don’t get back to work in time,” Powell said. “I’m much more concerned about that than the possibility which exists of higher inflation. … Frankly, we’d welcome higher inflation.”      This might be welcome news for bitcoin’s true believers.      The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will keep the target rate for federal funds in a range of 0% to 0.25%, and the Fed plans to keep buying $80 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities every month.      The committee noted that “the pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months,” but that it would continue accommodative monetary policy until inflation averages 2% over time.    Market reaction    The market didn’t budge at the news. The S&P 500 has been on a steady downward trajectory for most of the day and has fallen by more than 2%. Bitcoin was up a mere 1% since Powell’s comments.      The comments were in line with recent observations from economists who believe the Fed plans to let the economy run hot until sectors hard-hit by the pandemic reopen.      Powell did not address Vice Chair Richard Clarida’s comments earlier this year stating that the Fed would have to see inflation at 2% for a year before raising rates.    Read more: How Bitcoiners Should Watch the US Federal Reserve Meeting on Wednesday    The only time bitcoin came up during the meeting was in a question from CNBC’s senior economics reporter Steve Liesman who asked the chair if low interest rates were pushing up asset prices and creating a bubble that could cause economic fallout. Powell responded by saying that “financial stability vulnerabilities overall are moderate.”      “Because inflation has been running persistently below 2%, we’d like to see it run moderately above 2% for some time,” Powell said. “We have not adopted a formula, we’re not going to adopt a formula. … We’re going to preserve an element of judgement.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/27/fed-chair-powell-wed-welcome-higher-inflation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38f6237d3a3edf39ca42fbc55e877cbfc8ec592d-1385x865.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385788,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOJvR,1611784940,What DeFi Has in Common With Cubism,"Innovation requires a super-charged combinatorial hub, an environment where hyper-competition filters for the best ideas and allows them to proliferate. When we say best, we mean the most fit for their context, likely to sustain into future generations and outcompete from a multi game-theoretical or evolutionary perspective.      One common analogy is the Cambrian explosion, a period between 540 million and 520 million years ago that was responsible for exponential rise in the biodiversity of the Earth. It was caused by an interplay of multiple physical and biological causes, which were self-reinforcing, and created a pressure cooker of competition across ecological niches. In short, lots of new, successful critters, then their predators and then co-evolution.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    Looking at more recent examples, we can cite tech hubs around the world. Silicon Valley is what it is because of the hardware, telecom and high tech history of its location, the abundance of venture capital and a massive network effect. It is just the right soup to take a particular capitalist risk. More importantly, everyone else thinks it is the right place to take that risk. That belief in the belief is what gives the idea power. Consider as a comparison the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency.      If your startup is born in Silicon Valley, you are an organism of a certain type. Or alternately, if you are an organism of a certain type, you likely end up in Silicon Valley. Maybe not the actual one but one mediated by Twitter communities, and Zoom, and the recent migration into Clubhouse. You filter into a tribe of people whose attributes are fruitful for you to emulate, and then you compete in the games of their environment. The start-up game has very particular rules, no different from the rules that an arthropod must observe deep in the ocean.      With some low probability, you may win and turn into the “PayPal mafia.” This is an example of intergenerational survival and proliferation. As this type of organism acquired more resources, it spread its DNA (i.e., agile product development, software eating the world mission) and proliferated through angel investing. Perhaps less cliche are examples of artists, poets, and revolutionaries. Take any artistic movement – say the early Cubists in the 1910s in Paris.      Pablo Picasso did not develop the style in isolation, no more than Satoshi Nakamoto conceived every derivative of a blockchain-based network. Rather, there was an interplay among Picasso, Georges Braque, Juan Gris, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier and Fernand Léger. These artists responded visually to the industrial machinery of their time, with photography unmooring art from physical representation towards emotion and symbolism.    Futures    What does this mean for the future of money?      When economists try to figure out the best shape of a monetary system, they are severely disadvantaged. Unlike scientists in other disciplines, who have labs and experiments to run, economists are stuck in history. Normally, you wouldn’t be able to hold all population variables constant and switch on and off from John Maynard Keynes to Friedrich Hayek. That would require a revolution and a seizure of the means of production and regulation. In peaceful times, perhaps it would require wildly political appointments to a Central Bank. Further, a wrong turn or a bad model would lead to a destructive effect on the financial lives of millions of people.      So what do you do? After getting a PhD from Chicago and practice in a lot of formal mathematics, you might turn to historical aberrations. You find “naturally occurring experiments,” and deploy the statistical econometrics toolbox to figure out which levers did what in that environment. You design 50-page papers with deep analytical underpinnings and hundreds of footnotes full of multivariate equations, and hope for the best.      See also: Lex Sokolin - The Smart Money Economy      Sometimes, history really does provide useful experiments. Take the free banking era from 1837 to 1864, when the 50 states in the U.S. each ran slightly divergent financial policy. It used to be that central banking was quite controversial in the U.S. and that each state localized the issuance of credit and money.      Private companies in these states were permissioned to issue bank notes that would function like currency (or a cash equivalent), and be redeemable into collateral held by the bank. The collateral ranged widely in quality, from currencies to other liabilities like state-issued bonds. The notes themselves would trade at different discounts depending on the State you were in, your counterparty and the market conditions.      A bank run would involve many people wanting to redeem the notes at a bank at the same time, which in turn would often blow up the underlying institutions, either because they were over-levered or held poor/fraudulent collateral. Some states like New York actually showed very low loss rates on bank notes. Others, including Indiana and Wisconsin, experienced much more volatility and bank closures.      Yet, today we have in place an orthodoxy about the right way to do monetary policy, which involves the close regulation of banking for the purpose of managing the money supply and the economic cycle. That means even less space to do experiments, such as implementing nominal GDP targeting for three years and then reverting, or running several simultaneous policies side by side as an A/B test. Given that we have entered a truly bizarre, strange phase of the economy epitomized by negative interest rates, $2 trillion Apples and Amazons, multi-trillion dollar COVID-19 social programs and always-rising stock markets, it would be super prudent to try out different policies experimentally.      But we can’t.    The money accelerator    The evolution of our money machines is stuck at a local maximum (the point at which one needs to step out of a system to get beyond it).      They are incumbent and hegemonic. They are gargantuan and monolithic, moored and tied into the physical economy. The crypto money machines are not yet in such a position.      Let’s consider them – the protocols on programmable blockchains – as a type of animal. Like the state banks in the free banking era (1837-1864), the protocols are collateralized with certain capital assets. Rather than obligations of states backed by taxes, that capital is often digital capital of another sort. It can be the store-of-value function of bitcoin, or the computational rent of ether, or the derivative promises of various Compound, Aave, Uni or Yearn pools and vaults.      In crypto language, collateral is “locked,” which then generates a particular structured note/receipt token. This is not much different as a mechanism from free banking, and is referred by the industry as “open finance” (short for open-source finance), or decentralized finance (DeFi).      Nothing is new, dear reader.      A run on the collateral would similarly be a familiar sight, an unwinding of interconnected positions across the DeFi ecosystem. However, one major difference is that the entire thing does not have the embedded uncertainty of prior eras. The actual exposures are etched directly into all of the financial systems. We know exactly how collateralized all the positions are and many industry participants can derive this number from easily available data and analytics services.      Further, the process of doing the work of collateralizing bank notes in 1850 and 2021 are pretty different. DeFi is blazing fast. In months, you can engineer and launch an entire economic system humming along on the latest financial software available to human kind. In minutes, you can re-price your risk and swap out your collateral. In fact, the robots will do all this for you.      The community of DeFi is like that community of Cubists in the 1910s passing ideas back and forth to engineer an innovation, a style, a fashion that will be the root of how we think about the financial world for years to come. It sits on a manifesto about what money and finance should do for the individual, accessible anywhere in the world.      And it is full of rapid experiments that economists can only dream about. Those experiments compete for capital and reproduce through software forks. Many unfit versions of these experiments die out, while the fit ones re-combine and evolve.    DeFi    We were inspired to write up this framing by the recent launches of projects like BadgerDAO and ArcX. You can think of them as individual instances of free banks, operating under different collateralization and issuance rules.      Badger generates a synthetic elastic price asset called DIGG, which is pegged to the price of bitcoin. Its arithmetic token count automatically adjusts to make sure that the peg holds (with your percentage position of the money supply held stable), and its value is driven by the price and demand for a stable bitcoin-like asset on Ethereum, as well as the liquidity provision in certain automated market makers.      See also: Lex Sokolin - Valuing Open Source: Principles for Acquiring DeFi Projects    ArcX allows users to take various synthetic assets (created from other collateralized experiments), which are equivalent to our previously discussed bank notes, and then use those as collateral to further mint/create a new financial asset called STABLExhttps://wiki.arcx.money/core-concepts, which in turn opens up various algorithmic savings rates.    There are many more other novel ideas in the space as well. These are just our chosen examples of 400+ different projects reproducing at the moment. To be clear, most of these will die, and some are destructive rather than collaborative in spirit. Some are multi-level marketing schemes, or wrong in their mathematics and code.

42385804,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOKFZ,1611783775,Bitcoin ‘Underperforms’ During Tax Time: Analysis,"January ushers in a new tax season. It is also, historically, a time when bitcoin underperforms relative to the other months of the year. Some analysts say that may not be a coincidence.      From 2014 to 2020, bitcoin was down in four out of seven Januarys and six out of the past seven Marchs. According to Delphi Digital, average losses for those months were 5.24% and 12.59%, respectively.      “As we enter tax season, [a period when] bitcoin has historically underperformed other months, this by no means is predictive on a stand-alone basis but important to note,” Paul Burlage, analyst at Delphi Digital, told CoinDesk.      At the press time, bitcoin’s price was at $31,571.54, down 1.22% in the past 24 hours. The No. 1 cryptocurrency by market cap fell below $30,000 briefly earlier Wednesday, according to the CoinDesk BPI.      According to Delphi Digital’s January bitcoin outlook report, one of the biggest reasons for the drop is that “those [investors and traders] who realized significant gains trading various crypto assets last year will likely have to sell at least a portion of their holdings to cover expected tax liabilities.”      ""It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly how much selling pressure can be expected, and different jurisdictions treat capital gains more favorably than others,"" Kevin Kelly, co-founder and head of global macro at Delphi Digital, said. ""But bitcoin alone added more than $400 billion to its total market value last year. A decent portion of those returns accrued to speculators and traders who may have already realized some gains or rolled profits into other corners of the crypto market, thus triggering taxable events.""      The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released updated instructions with on answers to virtual currency-related questions during taxpayers’ tax filing at the end of December. Compared with 2019, 2020’s tax form places a yes-or-no question (“At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”) right on the first page, one of the first questions asked.      IRS guidance also further clarifies that transactions involving “virtual currency” will include “purchase of virtual currency.”    Future taxing of unrealized gains?    In recent days, there has been market chatter around Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s proposal on taxing unrealized capital gains. Such a proposal would have a broader impact on crypto-related gains.      John Todaro, director of institutional research at TradeBlock, told CoinDesk last week that tax proposals on unrealized capital gains would impose a degree of impact on investors on almost every asset. Cryptocurrency analytics firm TradeBlock is a subsidiary of CoinDesk.      Read More: Bitcoin Slumps to $31K on Sell-Off in US and Europe      The Biden Administration’s tax proposal also has some points that might affect crypto investors. One of the proposals, for example, includes collecting taxes of “long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the ordinary income tax rate of 39.6% on income above $1 million,” which could impact larger crypto investors.

Those include in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which hit a record level of value locked on Tuesday.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $31,600 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $29,298-$32,939 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour but below the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin lost ground for the second straight day Wednesday. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency fell to as low as $29,298 around 15:00 UTC (10 a.m. ET), according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Read More: Bitcoin Below $30K, Dollar Bounces Ahead of Fed Reserve Announcement      It was the first time bitcoin traded below $30,000 since Jan. 21. On that day, prices went as low as $28,845 before picking up and staying in a $30,000-$35,000 range until Wednesday.      “Technically, BTC is still in a descending triangle, which is a continuation pattern, showing lower highs and lower lows with currently a floor price at $29,000,” Cindy Leow, portfolio manager of multi-strategy trading firm 256 Capital Partners, told CoinDesk. “But if we close daily below [$29,000], could see another sweep of the mid-$20,000s.”      Traders appear to be distracted by other opportunities such as GameStop (NYSE: GME) and fiat currencies in the foreign exchange market, noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “Attention is likely elsewhere, especifically the GME drama and dollar strength,” Lau said.

However, it was on an uptrend according to Tuesday’s closing data from CoinDesk subsidiary TradeBlock. It’s worth noting that over the past month, notional value, which represents the total value of positions, seems to spike nicely with price gains.      “Bitcoin’s held up so far, but a decided break might trigger further price declines,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital assets prime broker Bequant. “This is despite bullish momentum from institutional investors including the likes of BlackRock [BLK], publicly listed Marathon [MARA] and university endowment funds.”      After dropping to a one-year low of 0.55 on Jan 4., the 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and ether is picking back up, to 0.65 as of Tuesday’s close data.      Peter Chan, lead trader at OneBit Quant, expects long-term BTC and ETH correlation to head closer to 1, which is the strongest correlation number between assets. “There's always been a strong correlation between BTC and ETH on the macro view,” Chan said. “In this case there's mean reversion opportunity – for example, short ETH and long BTC.”    Value locked in DeFi increases over 2,900% in past year    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Wednesday, trading around $1,288 and slipping 3.9% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Carstens' comments, which he delivered to the Hoover Institute, underscored his belief that bitcoin fails as a currency, a medium of exchange and a value storage mechanism, working only as a ""speculative asset"" and seldom as money.      He also issued a dire warning to would-be bitcoin investors: The center cannot hold:      ""Above all, investors must be cognizant that bitcoin may well break down altogether. Scarcity and cryptography alone do not suffice to guarantee exchange,"" he said.      Carstens then levied attacks against the attributes that have kept bitcoin running. He pointed out the ""sad side effect"" of bitcoin's monstrous electricity dependence, which he said is as high as Switzerland's where the BIS is based. Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism currently burns through reams of energy.      Carstens blasted what he framed as the inevitable systems failure hard-coded into bitcoin's 21 million issuance cap. Fewer coins getting minted means fewer miners processing transactions, he said, and confirmation wait times will go up. So, too, will bitcoin's vulnerability to a ""majority attack.""      ""So, clearly, if digital money is to exist, the central bank must play a pivotal role, guaranteeing the stability of value, ensuring the elasticity of the aggregate supply of such money, and overseeing the overall security of the system,"" he said.      Bitcoiners were merciless in their rebuttal.      Jameson Lopp, chief technical officer at bitcoin storage startup Casa told CoinDesk Carstens' argument fails to stand up to bitcoin's technical realities.      ""Bitcoin becoming attackable like other networks is not likely, because it would still require a large upfront capital expense for someone to acquire the appropriate hardware. This would only make sense in a world where another SHA256 secured network came along and became far more valuable to mine than Bitcoin,"" he wrote in an email.      Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter issued CoinDesk a point-by-point takedown of Carstens arguments, asserting that volatility does not mean something cannot be money, and that it doesn't matter one way or another if bitcoin is money because it is ""a means to store value over time and space,"" a job that Carter said bitcoin does better than gold.      Carter also said the Bitcoin network's energy dependence is a function of price and issuance, not security or necessity.      ""Regardless, the energy cost is well worth paying because the existence of a non-state monetary commodity is something that the world finds valuable,"" Carter said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/27/bis-chief-blasts-bitcoins-viability-prompting-blowback-from-advocates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91b922fb62942d7bfe0c1e95ab60cbc6557a9b88-1500x932.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385805,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOKGp,1611777861,Geopolitics at Stake in US Response to China's Digital Yuan: Report,"While not many technical details of China’s plans for its central bank digital currency (CBDC) are publicly available, the digital yuan is already raising concerns around privacy, national security and political power.  The Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DCEP) system would give the Chinese Communist Party the powerful ability to monitor in real time the minute financial dealings of its citizens.  The U.S. needs to accelerate its development of tools for dealing with CBDCs on the global stage.    China is leading the world in the development and piloting of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). With that lead comes increased scrutiny and concerns over the downstream effects a digital yuan might have regarding privacy and political power.      A new report from the Center for New American Security (CNAS) not only lays out in stark terms the history and state of China’s CBDC system but also reviews what few technical details of it are available and recommends policy steps the U.S. should consider in an escalating CBDC conflict.      “This CBDC system, which the Chinese government calls Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DCEP), will likely enable the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to strengthen its digital authoritarianism domestically and export its influence and standard-setting abroad,” reads the report.      “By eliminating some of the previous constraints on government data collection of private citizens’ transactions, DCEP represents a significant risk to the long-held standards of financial privacy upheld in free societies.”    Privacy risks of China's digital yuan    The privacy concerns arise largely from the massive amount of insight a CBDC would give Chinese authorities into its users’ financial data and behavior, as well as information about anyone who interacts with those users – including, potentially, American citizens.      “DCEP would give the Chinese Communist Party something that no government has ever had in history: The ability to monitor in real time the minute financial dealings of its citizens,” said Yaya J. Fanusie, an Adjunct Senior Fellow at CNAS and co-author of the report, in an email to CoinDesk. His research focuses on the national security implications of cryptocurrencies.      He said that while much of the world transacts digitally today, that transactional data is not accessible wholesale by government authorities because the government has to go through financial institutions to acquire the data.    Read more: How FinCEN Became a Honeypot for Sensitive Personal Data    The DCEP design deviates from this model, putting the data directly in the hands of the CCP without having to go through intermediaries. Anyone using a digital yuan pretty much concedes his or her financial privacy directly to the Chinese government, according to Fanusie. It’s not yet clear how accessible DCEP would be outside China, but if it is, this has implications for other governments.      “The U.S. government needs to assess whether DCEP use should be blocked in the United States,” said Fanusie. “But private-sector U.S. tech companies should also be thinking about whether they will allow the DCEP application to be accessible on their platforms, such as app stores.”      The report notes that officials of the People’s Bank of China have said the CBDC will have “controllable anonymity,” meaning the central bank could observe and monitor transactions taking place while the transacting parties would remain private. However, the central bank has also said it would be still able to analyze transactions to monitor “crimes.”    Read more: ‘Digital Mercenaries’: Why Blockchain Analytics Firms Have Privacy Advocates Worried    Taken in conjunction with China’s loose-knit social credit system, information gleaned from digital yuan transactions could be used to wield punitive power against Chinese citizens. Additionally, any metadata collected could give insight into users’ personal and device movements, according to the report, further rounding out a body of significant personal data.      “PBOC modeling of DCEP shows that each digital currency token held by users would be constructed with a cryptographic algorithm expression, with various data inputs such as information on the owner of the token,” reads the report. “Not all of the data will be available to those transacting in DCEP, but they will all be available to the central bank, according to its early proposed design sketches and most technical reports about DCEP.”      Those findings were drawn, in part, from a 2018 presentation made by Yao Qian, the head of the PBOC's Digital Currency Research Initiative at the time, which indicates that the PBOC would have full access to ""identity info"", ""trading elements"", ""trading scenarios"" and ""derivative info"".      The PBOC will thus become a possessor of a significant data trove to combine with its tools for censuring and surveilling individuals.    The political power of CBDCs    Related to privacy concerns are the ways a lack of privacy coupled with the use of big data can be used to deprive individuals of political power and even change their behavior.      The parable of the panopticon is one way of looking at this. In it, a central observation tower is placed within a circle of prison cells so guards can see every cell and its occupant, while inmates are unable to see into the tower. Never knowing if they are being watched or not, prisoners assume they are being surveilled and behave accordingly – that is, the way authorities want them to act.      While certainly simplistic when it comes to the complications of the digital age, it’s a basic model for understanding that information and surveillance are forms of power that can be wielded in the service of a specific set of outcomes.    Read more: China’s Blockchain-Based Service Network to Integrate Central Bank Digital Currency    In the U.S., the founders created the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution precisely because it was understood that if the government had access to everyone’s private possessions (such as their papers at home), it would lead to government repression, according to Fanusie.      “This dynamic continues to exist, and places like China which don’t have this standard built into their governing system are more likely to abuse their citizens and hinder their ability to advocate for their interests or redress grievances,” he said.      The report notes the PBOC is already testing a digital yuan as “a way to disburse government salaries and subsidies.” The centralized monitoring and control of DCEP wallets would make it easier for the government to cut off a person's ability to transact than if it had to attempt to do so through other third parties.      Cryptocurrencies have been attractive to some parties as a means to engage in a financial world beyond the reach of the state. Some case studies of the benefits of this are clear in places like Nigeria, where groups protesting police violence were able to receive funds via bitcoin after the government froze their bank accounts, and in Belarus where protestors against the country’s latest illegitimate election were supported by bitcoin grants after being fired from their jobs for protesting.    Read more: China’s Digital Yuan Blurs the Lines Between CBDCs and Crypto    CBDCs bring the idea of a digital currency squarely under state control and may seem in conflict with the ethos of cryptocurrencies. But Fanusie said CBDCs probably won’t directly impact cryptocurrencies’ ability to flourish “unless financial authorities technically try to ban cryptocurrencies, which is not feasible.”      CBDCs could be seen as a way for citizens to have the functionality of digital money instead of permissionless cryptocurrencies.      “So, there’s certainly an element of governments wanting to compete with crypto,” said Fanusie. “But one big possibility is that by developing the infrastructure for digital wallets, programmability and microtransactions via CBDCs, governments might actually make cryptocurrency adoption easier.”    Policy recommendations    The report concludes with a set of specific policy recommendations from Fanusie and his co-author, Emily Jin, a research assistant for the Energy, Economics, and Security Program at CNAS.      These include things such as pursuing a diplomacy campaign urging Chinese government transparency and restraint in using DCEP for punitive measures, monitoring any DCEP data collection on U.S. citizens, making CBDCs a key part of U.S. national security concerns and examining the private sector in the U.S.’ ties to “China’s digital financial authoritarianism.”    Read more: Central Banks, Stablecoins and the Looming War of Currencies    Finally, the report suggests the U.S. lead CBDC standard-setting going forward, conduct more research into the economic impact of CBDCs, and look at economic statecraft possibilities for combatting CBDCs, including evaluating “whether and how the United States can apply sanctions tools to CBDCs.”      CBDCs aren’t a question of if at this point, but rather when. The sooner key considerations such as these are taken into account and seen as an integral part of geopolitics, the sooner countries can consider the risks and benefits they offer.      “The U.S. should raise this as an important issue in diplomatic channels and also emphasize the privacy component in intergovernmental discussions on CBDC, such as with the Bank for International Settlements, but also the Financial Stability Board, the G7, and G20,” said Fanusie.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | TRADING | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/27/geopolitics-at-stake-in-us-response-to-chinas-digital-yuan-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a564b64071cd82865ba459101cd5f8c32538d150-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42385792,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOK0T,1611777685,BIS: CBDC Research Gaining Steam but Widespread Issuance Years Away,"The monetary revolution will be digitized ... but for the vast majority of earthlings likely not anytime soon, according to central bank digital currency (CBDC) research published Wednesday by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).      To get there, though, 86% of the central banks surveyed in BIS’ third annual CBDC questionnaire said they were at least considering the pros and cons of issuing digital-first fiat, up from 80% last year. This year’s survey featured 65 central banks.      Even more telling was the share of central banks moving beyond mere table talk. BIS said 60% of central banks are now conducting CBDC experiments or proof of concepts. Just 42% said the same in 2019.      Read more: What Is a CBDC?      Emerging market central banks are driving CBDCs forward with more gusto and purpose than their counterparts in advanced economies, citing financial inclusion and payments efficiency as top motivating forces. They’re also participating in higher numbers: seven out of eight CBDC projects are in emerging markets.      “A testament to these motives is the launch of a first ‘live’ CBDC in the Bahamas,” BIS wrote. “This front-runner is likely to be joined by others: Central banks collectively representing a fifth of the world’s population are likely to issue a general purpose CBDC in the next three years.”      Although BIS did not provide a country-by-country issuance plan breakdown, that staggering figure could only be representative of China, home to over 18% of the world population and also one of the most advanced CBDC projects. China is already one year into pilot testing its DCEP.      Still, global CBDC adoption is likely still years away, BIS said. Countries are just not backing their heightened CBDC research with definitive plans to roll a project out. Tellingly, half of the central banks that in 2019 said they were “likely” to issue a CBDC in the short term downgraded their sentiment to “possible” or “unlikely” in the 2020 survey.      Advanced-stage projects are also hedging their go-live windows, BIS said.      Most central banks are more interested in a “retail” CBDC (consumer and day to day use) than a “wholesale” CBDC (systemic payments; transfers between banks). Some countries that once considered both models now focus their research on retail, perhaps seeing more value in digital fiat for the people than digital currency for the banks.      CBDC legality remains a largely unanswered question among the surveyed central banks. Forty-eight percent were not certain they had the authority to issue digital currency and 26% were certain they didn't.      Central banks continued to view cryptocurrencies as a largely irrelevant force with limited if any appeal in the 2020 survey. Strong majorities ranked cryptocurrencies as “trivial” for the domestic payments space for the third consecutive year. Notably, over 40% said crypto could have “nice” appeal in the cross-border payments space, a rare bright spot in the otherwise crypto-minimalist data.      Read more: Geopolitics at Stake in US Response to China’s Digital Yuan: Report      Central banks, and especially those in emerging markets, indicated more concern in the threat posed by stablecoins. Over two-thirds of central banks are studying the issue, BIS said.      But the respondents were nonetheless adamant that private stablecoin arrangements (read: Facebook’s libra/diem) are not a driving force behind their CBDC projects. Competition from stablecoins and cryptocurrencies fail to provide them with a compelling CBDC rationale.      “When it comes to cryptocurrencies, central banks continue to see them with no widespread use as a means of payment,” the report said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/27/bis-cbdc-research-gaining-steam-but-widespread-issuance-years-away,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eabec77b90ff45e3f8316493497db8c8729becb7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s up more than 92% in one week and up 1,300% since the token debuted in September 2020, according to CoinGecko at press time.      Valued at $4.2 billion, Uniswap's UNI has the highest market cap of any DeFi token on the market, according to research firm Messari.      The governance token has been caught up in bitcoin’s 2020-21 bull run along with other DeFi tokens. At $25.1 billion, DeFi Pulse’s Total Value Locked (TVL) metric – similar to assets under management (AUM) – is up nearly $10 billion from Jan. 1. TokenSets’ DeFi Pulse Index, which measures a suite of DeFi token prices, is also up 136% on the year.      A governance token, UNI holders can vote on the direction of Uniswap version 2 such as how the Uniswap treasury will be spent. The exchange’s weekly volume has also surpassed its impressive initial run during ""DeFi summer."" During the first three weeks of January, volume averaged some $5.6 billion while available liquidity on the exchange consistently sat above $3 billion, according to info.uniswap.      Those figures are even better than Uniswap’s summer run, which saw the exchange briefly surpass trading volumes on soon-to-IPO Coinbase. Not bad for a unicorn.      Read more: Uniswap Is the Number One Gas Guzzler on Ethereum      At the time, Uniswap conducted what’s called a token “airdrop” to anyone who had ever used the exchange before. The token drop was in response to rival exchange SushiSwap forking Uniswap’s codebase and trying to draw away users with a new token, SUSHI, in what is now called “vampire mining.” Each nominal user was given 400 UNI tokens amounting to 60% of the 1 billion UNI minted. Each airdrop is now worth about $6,000; it was jokingly referred to at the time as crypto’s own stimulus check. SUSHI is also up 177% over the last 30 days, according to Messari.      Uniswap investors, advisers and team members are also up big after an initial allocation of the tokens, although a four-year vesting schedule remains in place. According to a Uniswap blog post, 21% or 212,660,000 UNI (at press time: $3.2 billion), were allocated for current and future team members.

The social media platform announced Wednesday it was expanding its work with the Ethereum Foundation to provide development resources to scaling tools. In the announcement, posted to the Ethereum subreddit, Reddit employee u/jarins said the move increases its commitment to the technology, and echoes its long-held ""decentralized ethos.""      “In this new stage of our partnership, immediate efforts will be focused on bringing Ethereum to Reddit-scale production,” the announcement said. “Our intention is to help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like Community Points on Ethereum.”      This partnership could result in Reddit working on layer 2 scaling tools or pushing projects from a prototype stage to production.      Reddit development resources, including a developer team, would be involved in this work. Ultimately, the idea is a project like Reddit’s Community Points feature could be capable of supporting the site’s millions of users (Reddit has over 50 million daily users as of press time, according to Wednesday's announcement).      “Our blockchain efforts will be led by Reddit’s Crypto team,” the announcement said, adding the company currently has job openings for backend engineers.    Community points    Reddit introduced Community Points last year, rolling them out to the CryptoCurrency and FortNiteBR subreddits (communities built around cryptocurrency discussion and the FortNite game).      In short, the idea is users can reward each other points for making “quality posts,” with these points being redeemable for badges or other custom features. These points are stored on Ethereum’s Rinkeby testnet as ERC-20 tokens, meaning that unlike Reddit’s in-house karma system, the company cannot control these points.      The company had been experimenting with the idea for at least a month prior to rolling it out to the website. In June, it asked for the community to assist with scaling the project.

An active Reddit-based trading community is causing more equities to behave like characteristically volatile cryptocurrencies amid an ongoing campaign of monstrous short squeezes. In response to abnormal market behavior, brokers and other financial service providers are threatening to cut off trading access to “limit risk.”      Self-described as ""like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,"" the Wall Street Bets (WSB) trading community on Reddit wreaked chaos in traditional markets after pumping GameStop (GME) nearly 900% in five days to around $380 Wednesday morning. And the mayhem is spreading.      Other heavily shorted stocks such as BlackBerry (BB) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) have seen triple-digit percentage gains in the past couple weeks as WSB traders set their sights on these companies. Even Eastman Kodak (KODK) shot up nearly 50% Wednesday, briefly trading near $14 after closing trading on Tuesday below $9.50.      Short selling is a bet that the price of GameStop stock will go down.      Other companies including Tootsie Roll (TR) and National Beverage Corp. (FIZZ) are also among the most-shorted stocks by hedge funds, per data from CNBC, making them possible WSB candidates in the future.      The long list of worries and problems this irregular market activity is causing includes inflicting heavy financial losses at hedge funds such as Melvin Capital, which held a large short position on GameStop. The fund finally capitulated and closed its position Tuesday after taking a ""huge loss,"" CNBC reported.      The Reddit trading community cheered. But trading services are reacting sternly to the chaos.      After tweeting about ""unprecedented volumes"" that ""may be causing limited acess,"" TD Ameritrade simply restricted client trading for GameStop, AMC and other securities ""in the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients.""      Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman told CNBC Thursday her firm actively monitors social media chatter and will halt stock trading if the content it sees matches with ""unusual activity in stocks.""      Bloomberg reported that Wells Fargo also banned its advisers from making stock recommendations on GameStop and AMC Entertainment.      Government officials and regulators are also watching. The Biden Administration's economic team is ""monitoring the [GameStop] situation,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday afternoon. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also released a statement Wednesday evening saying it is ""aware of and actively monitoring the on-going market volatility in the options and equities markets.""    Read more: GameStop Investing Craze ‘Proof of Concept’ for Bitcoin Success, Says Scaramucci    Social media accounts used by members of the Reddit-spawned group have been shut down or limited. Discord banned the group's server, ostensibly for hate speech, Wednesday evening, claiming that it has issued multiple warnings to the server admin ""over the past few months,"" per reporting by The Verge.      The group's epicenter – r/wallstreetbets – was switched from public to invite-only around the same time, although a Reddit spokesperson told CoinDesk the company did not initiate the settings change. The group's moderators did, the spokesperson said; the mods later confirmed this, and the subreddit was switched back to a public setting.      In the interim, a new public Wall Street Bets-branded subreddit was quickly spun up, and a self-described splinter group formed on the Telegram messaging service, highlighting the community's determination to reorganize regardless of external pressure.      Cryptocurrency investors are capitalizing on the craziness to highlight a potentially universal use case for trading and financial services that cannot be limited or subject to similar crackdowns. Galaxy Digital (GLXY) CEO Mike Novogratz took to Twitter to say the WSB episodes are ""a giant endorsement"" of decentralized finance. But whether these rogue traders will show any interest in blockchain-based products remains an open question.      Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick called short sellers, in general, a ""curious bunch"" who profit through ""courage and careful research."" But as the WSB saga continues, he warned, ""many"" could quickly ""find themselves swamped.""      ""No one can withstand [...] an investor tsunami aimed at short sellers,"" Sosnick said.

42385785,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOFdz,1611769760,Blockchain Bites: Scaramucci on GameStop and Bitcoin; Why Flamingo DAO Dropped $762K on an NFT,"Three stories    EY’s blockchain lead Paul Brody thinks decentralized finance (DeFi) could be coming to everyday consumers. The EY team usually focuses its attention on enterprise blockchain, but the red-hot fintech market, and its mirror image in DeFi, has caught Brody’s eye. According to his theory, platforms such as Robinhood, PayPal and Square could look to integrate increasingly popular DeFi applications.    “If I had to make a bold prediction, I think by the end of 2021 at least one major financial institution will up the game on everybody else by offering some form of consumer DeFi, accessible through their single transactional window to a large consumer base,” he told CoinDesk’s Ian Allison.  In August, Brody wrote a CoinDesk op-ed arguing enterprises would use DeFi if it weren’t so public.  Meanwhile, Terraform Labs, the creator of Cosmos blockchain-based “volatility-free” tokens used to buy synthetic stocks, has brought in $25 million from the likes of Galaxy Digital, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital and others.    A bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is unlikely, until the cryptocurrency’s market cap nearly quintuples to $2 trillion, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood said at Tuesday’s ETF Trends Big Ideas event. The long-sought financial instrument would lead to more institutional involvement from firms that want indirect exposure to bitcoin’s volatility.    The Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF, saying that the underlying asset is too illiquid and could be manipulated.  That said, Wood thinks the momentum is in bitcoin’s favor, with blockchain advocates like Gary Gensler coming into key regulatory positions.  Taking the cynical view, former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said regulators would put the hammer down if bitcoin got big enough.    SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci, a johnny-come-lately to the bitcoin parade, compared the community driving up GameStop (NYSE: GME) stock to bitcoin’s.      For the uninitiated, GameStop has become the choice stock for a group of so-called degenerate gamblers looking to beat out a hedge fund that has gone short on the dying video game retailer. Looking to “squeeze” the Wall Street firm’s short positions, a disparate group of traders organized on Reddit have “aped into” GME, driving up the price.    Melvin Capital and Citron Capital, the Goliaths to the degenerate Davids, have reportedly been forced to close their positions at “a loss of 100%,” according to Bloomberg.  It’s really a sight to behold. Describing the price action, Scaramucci threw around terms like “democratizing” and “decentralizing” and called the whole show a “proof of concept that bitcoin is going to work.”  For those in this decentralized rabble looking to professionalize, Bitcoin booster and partner at Morgan Creek Digital,Anthony Pompliano has set up a crypto jobs board.  At stake    This past Saturday, a decentralized organization, Flamingo DAO, dropped $761,889 on a single token. Not just any random crypto, this was a non-fungible, one-of-a-kind, tokenized set of pixels, called an NFT. It was also part of cryptocurrency history.      CryptoPunks were an early experiment with NFT art. They proved the theory that the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could be applied to any digital artifact. From mortgages to Monets, anything could be made scarce, and therefore valuable, through tokenization.      This includes the “Alien” punk that Flamingo bought. One of nine such pixelated portraits, this particular NFT was highly sought after. @0x_b1, a DeFi personality who also bid on the item, valued it at roughly $1 million.      CoinDesk sat down with Chris Furlong, a member of Flamingo DAO, to discuss why the 4,800 ETH fund bought the Alien punk and what’s next for NFTs.      Can you give any more clarity on why Flamingo decided to invest in an early digital collectible?      There's a great passion within our membership about the importance of Cryptopunks. We place a value on NFTs with historical significance and want to be good stewards of items we hold in our collection. There's also a hedge with punks because they are priced in ETH, have the longest historical sales record, and ultimately serve as a store of value. Some may laugh, but we believe punks are just as much a store of value as bitcoin is. This purchase is a reflection of our long term bullish sentiment on the entire crypto space.      What is Flamingo's ultimate investment strategy?      There are many avenues and templates to follow. The B20 Collection from Metapurse just showed us how you can take a big ticket NFT purchase and allow the community to participate through sharding, tokenization and creating a metaverse experience. That's one possible avenue. We are exploring several ideas, but our members are very excited about the concept of giving Punk #2890 agency in the Ethereum community. We want him to be an active participant, a citizen of the world we are all building. How this will happen is still a matter of experimentation. We'll take it slowly with the punk who fell to Earth.      It seems like every other week there's a new record NFT sale. Why do you think this little corner of crypto is heating up?      I think there was a real pent-up desire to participate in the Ethereum ecosystem. Early development was focused on building out primitives and tooling. This required development and engineering skills. After that came DeFi, which was the realm of quants, traders and coders. All of us saw the potential of the ecosystem, but the ability to participate was limited to the few. NFTs opened Ethereum and crypto up to so many people who were following its progress but didn't have a way to actively engage it.      What will the metaverse look like by 2030?      In 2030, the metaverse will be more fluid, interoperable both between online worlds and the real world. Digital objects will appear in houses, you will move freely online. Everything will become blended, and if done correctly it will feel natural. By allowing ourselves to expand the definition of space, which today is governed by the physics of the concrete to one that includes digital realms, we can perhaps reconcile the dichotomy we struggling with where information moves at the speed of light, but our bodies and senses are rooted in the same speed as our ancestors.      Is it worth asking whether crypto art is real, without getting into a debate over what constitutes real art?      No. It's a disservice to the creators whose vision and beauty so many people are opening up to today. Art is always subjective, and its definition is best formed on an individual basis rather than being dictated by gatekeepers.      What other areas in NFTs are you excited by?      All of them. Digital art, avatars, collectibles, virtual worlds. There are so many exciting use cases that are being unlocked and discovered. While NFTs are mainly a creative playground today, in some cases literal toys, we will soon see NFTs used in broader applications like financial instruments and intellectual property rights.    Market intel    Bitcoin and global equities are trading lower, while the anti-risk U.S. dollar is climbing ahead of a scheduled U.S. Federal Reserve meeting today. Bitcoin dropped below $30,000, a more than 5% drop on the day, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.    The Fed Reserve is expected to leave the interest rate unchanged near zero and maintain its liquidity-boosting, bond-purchasing plan at around $120 billion per month. This could favor bitcoin’s deflationary narrative.  Though there’s uncertainty whether Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will announce a gradual unwinding of stimulus programs, essentially as a precautionary measure to stymie inflation.    Although inflation hasn’t yet arrived – it has consistently fallen below the Fed’s 2% target – many economists project that coronavirus-led fiscal and monetary stimulus, to the tune of trillions of dollars and counting, could have knock-on effects.

42385780,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOFYx,1611768174,The Bitcoin Paradox,"“There's none so blind as those who will not listen."" - Neil Gaiman, ""American Gods""      In a recent piece for Coin Geek titled ""The BTC bubble will pop soon,"" the journalist Patrick Thompson writes: “the digital currency market bubble is coming to an end; some believe that the markets have one pump left before a major decline, but regardless, the end is near.”    J. Mac Ghlionn is a performance specialist currently based in Asia. He is obsessed with all things crypto, from amnesia to currencies.    You heard it here, folks. The end is near.      But wait, haven’t we heard this all before? Yes, hundreds of times. In fact, as I have written elsewhere, Satoshi’s brainchild has died some 400 times since its inception. Jesus supposedly rose from the dead once, but the man from Nazareth has got nothing on bitcoin.      You see, bitcoin is not a bubble, it’s a pin. It’s the answer to the question of how we, the people, combat financial mismanagement and fiduciary negligence.      Then again, it is a bubble. I call this the Bitcoin Paradox. Let me explain.      2020 was the year bitcoin went institutional. In November, for example, Ruffer, the British-based juggernaut, declared that it had invested more than $700 million in bitcoin. The move, according to a Ruffer statement, was a “protective” one, a hedge against monetary inflation.    Inhabitants of epistemic bubbles are only interested in accessing information that reinforces already existing beliefs.    More recently, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, joined the world of crypto, authorizing two of its most valued funds to invest in bitcoin futures. With more than $7.8 trillion under management, the BlackRock move may very well help elevate bitcoin to the next level. So, as you can see, 2021 is very different to 2017, when cries of ""bubble"" were more understandable.      In 2021, cries of ""bubble"" are still reasonable. Not because bitcoin is a financial bubble but because it is an epistemic one.      Epistemic bubbles involve individuals accessing information in a heavily biased manner, greedily accepting what they want to hear, and ignoring anything distasteful, no matter how accurate the evidence may be.      In a nutshell, inhabitants of epistemic bubbles are only interested in accessing information that reinforces already existing beliefs. Once gas issues are resolved, Ethereum has the potential to displace Bitcoin. It’s younger, fresher and possesses huge potential, possibly more potential than Bitcoin can ever hope to possess. Some prominent Satoshi devotees, or Satoshees, refuse to accept this very fact.      As the author Haziq Ariffin warns: “Epistemic bubbles can be damaging. The people we surround ourselves with tend to be like-minded, so our world gets highly filtered and falsely appears to confirm everything we believe. This, in turn, causes us to raise our confidence in our beliefs each time others around us express agreement. … But it shouldn’t.”      It’s easy to see why. After all, we are in the midst of bitcoin mania, a deeply psychological phenomenon. Symptoms may include unreasonable levels of euphoria, volatile moods (thus reflecting the crypto market), hyperactivity (again, reflecting the crypto market) and delusions (sometimes reflecting the crypto market).      Jesus (yes, another Jesus reference) spoke about the dangers of false prophets. Though he never commented on crypto, one assumes he would warn against misplaced confidence.    A rational bitcoiner will remove herself from the bubble, at least temporarily, and examine the situation.    Right now, bitcoin is in a real position of power, but power is intoxicating, and intoxication can impair judgement. If in doubt, just ask Mel Gibson.      A king, no matter how powerful, must always be aware of one simple fact – others are always vying for his seat. As George R.R. Martin wrote, “The Iron Throne will go to the man who has the strength to seize it.”      That “man” appears to be Ethereum. Of course, many a Satoshee will scoff at such a statement. However, contrary to popular opinion, ignorance is not bliss. Competition exists. A rational bitcoiner will remove herself from the bubble, at least temporarily, and examine the situation.      There is every possibility that Ethereum and Bitcoin can co-exist in a crypto-infused Shangri-La. Then again, there’s a chance – a slim one, but still a chance – that Ethereum will dethrone Bitcoin. Failure to accept this possibility could prove to be fatal. Epistemic ignorance never ends well.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | ETH | MARKET,John Mac Ghlionn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/27/the-bitcoin-paradox,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/687c354cc09142c81f56571d44d9bd03c6d91eed-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin ""leaves a permanent, unalterable record, hence why almost all criminals using it are caught. It is fundamentally wrong to say that bitcoin is mostly used for crime,” he said.  On the other hand, up to 90% of $100 bills are ""used for organized crime and tax evasion"" in the U.S., because cash is ""untraceable and fungible,"" Hutchins said.  Indeed, as CoinDesk reported, blockchain sleuthing firm Chainalysis reported this month that criminal-linked activity made up just 0.34% of cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2020, down from 2.1% the year before.  Also speaking at Davos on Monday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey took a more negative tone, arguing that digital innovation in payments is here to stay, but not cryptocurrency as it currently stands.

42385776,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOFQ9,1611756364,South African Regulator Seeks More Crypto Powers After Alleged Ponzi Schemer's Collapse,"South Africa’s financial market regulator is seeking greater oversight of the cryptocurrency trading industry following the collapse of a bitcoin company alleged to have been the nation's biggest Ponzi scheme.    Brandon Topham, head of enforcement at the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), told Bloomberg Tuesday his agency is making new proposals to regulate cryptocurrencies in order to be able to prosecute fraudsters.  “At the point something becomes a Ponzi scheme, we have lost our jurisdiction,” Topham told Bloomberg. “We need the police and the prosecuting authority to work fast and put people in jail.”  The move comes after a recent FSCA investigation into Mirror Trading International (MTI), a bitcoin trading club that had allegedly been operating illegally and lied to investors.  As reported by CoinDesk, MTI had claimed to be able to create profits of 10% per month by using bots to carry out high-frequency trading using client’s pooled bitcoin.  The firm was declared fraudulent by Texas state regulators in July last year, and the FSCA probe concluded MTI deliberately misled investors and operated a financial service without a license.

42385786,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOFfF,1611756034,"First Mover: Risks Nobody's Ever Seen, From the Fed to Tether (and GameStop)","Bitcoin (BTC) was lower, though staying in its range over the past six days, between roughly $30,000 and $33,000.      Cryptocurrency traders and analysts planned to keep an eye on an expected Federal Reserve announcement Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET in Washington (19:00 UTC), detailing the U.S. central bank's latest monetary policy plans as the coronavirus continues to ravage the economy. At a scheduled press conference afterward, Chair Jerome Powell will likely field questions about the U.S. central bank's $120 billion-a-month bond purchases – a key focus for bitcoin traders betting the ongoing money-printing could eventually lead to inflation.      ""Bitcoin seems poised to consolidate a little more, but if the Fed is not dovish enough and the dollar rebounds, the $30,000 level could easily break,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst in New York for the London-based foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, said in emailed comments.      (NOTE: CoinDesk's Nathan DiCamillo talked to top economists including Ken Rogoff and Claudia Sahm about this week's Fed meeting. The takeaway was that while no major announcements are expected Wednesday, Fed Chair Powell and his colleagues at the central bank will soon have to tackle the thorny issue of how to keep inflation from spiraling out of control once the economy opens back up. Full story: How Bitcoiners Should Watch the US Federal Reserve Meeting on Wednesday.)      In traditional markets, European shares slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open. Gold weakened 0.4% to $1,843 an ounce.    Market moves    With bitcoin trading in a range, why not spend a little time discussing the potential market risks surrounding tether (USDT), the largest dollar-linked stablecoin? After all, as CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey reports, a lot of cryptocurrency traders and industry executives would rather ignore the topic altogether, even though in some ways it's become more important than ever.      Tether has become a key source of liquidity for cryptocurrency traders in recent years because the tokens can easily be moved around in blockchain-based digital markets.      But doubts have persisted for several years about the stablecoin, primarily related to a lack of full audits of the reserves backing the tokens. In 2018 a pair of academics wrote in a peer-reviewed research paper that tether minting might have helped inflate the bitcoin market during the 2017 bull run.      So one question is what might happen to bitcoin prices if ungainly revelations on tether emerge. Multiple ongoing investigations, including from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the New York Attorney General’s office, have dogged the stablecoin company, as detailed by Cawrey.      What makes this a more pressing issue now is the industry's recent fast-paced growth, which might just magnify the risks: The outstanding amount of tether has roughly quintupled over the past year to about $25 billion.      Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner told CoinDesk, “We work with regulators and law enforcement agencies around the world to help their investigations and help them understand our business.""      For their part, authorities have stepped up regulation of cryptocurrencies as the industry's market capitalization climbed above $1 trillion for the first time. In the U.S., the Office of the Comptroller of Currency said this month that federally regulated banks can use stablecoins for payments and other services. U.K. officials released a paper and request for commentary on the use of stablecoins in finance.      Kevin Lehtiniitty, chief strategy officer of Prime Trust, a Nevada-based trust company that has worked extensively with stablecoins, told Cawrey he thinks officials might be planning a framework around stablecoins backed by the regulated banking system – in an effort to weed out possible systemic risks. For now, he says, most cryptocurrency traders are probably just ignoring those risks.      “What are the odds that it’s going to crash in the next few hours that I’m holding?” Lehtiniitty said. ”And that’s what is the world’s dumbest excuse. But I hear it time and time again from over-the-counter and trading partners, other folks, and it drives me nuts.”      Read More: Questions About Tether Just Won’t Go Away. Does the Crypto Market Care?      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin is locked in the $30,000 to $35,000 range for the fifth straight day in a sign of caution ahead of the the Federal Reserve meeting, which could inject volatility into financial markets.      The Fed is expected to leave the interest rate unchanged near zero and maintain its liquidity-boosting bond-buying plan at around $120 billion/month. The status quo decision is unlikely to elicit a reaction from bitcoin and markets in general.      However, if Powell drops hints of an early tapering (gradual unwinding) of stimulus programs, stocks could drop and the safe-haven dollar would likely draw bids, pushing bitcoin lower.      “BTC may face selling pressure if Powell signals an early taper,” Darius Sit, co-founder and managing partner at the Singapore-based QCP Capital, told CoinDesk.      The Fed has made it clear since August that it intends to keep interest rates low for some time even after inflation climbs above 2%. According to FXStreet’s Yohay Elam, Powell may indirectly signal a willingness to buy more bonds by calling for increased fiscal (government) spending, in which case liquidity plays like bitcoin and gold would shine. President Joe Biden is pushing for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, and the government might have to rely on the Fed for at least part of the extra funding, as noted by Elam.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Drops, Dollar Bounces Ahead of Federal Reserve Rate Announcement    What's hot    Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu's exit resolves years-long power struggle as mining firm preps IPO (CoinDesk)      Genesis Capital's active outstanding loans surge by 81% during 4Q 2020 to $3.8B (CoinDesk) (EDITOR'S NOTE: Genesis is a unit of Digital Currency Group, the owner of CoinDesk)      Silver Lake's Glenn Hutchins (until recently a New York Fed board member) says it's ""fundamentally wrong to say that bitcoin is most used for crime"" (Finextra)      Social networks turn to blockchain technology amid concerns over power wielded by centralized tech giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter (NYT)      Bitcoin is an incredibly dirty business, with a carbon footprint comparable to New Zealand's (Bloomberg Opinion)      Bitcoin locked in DeFi protcols tops $40K, potentially showing traders rotating into altcoins in pursuit of juicier opportunities (CoinDesk)      ARK's Cathie Wood says bitcoin ETF approval unlikely until market cap rises to about $2T (CoinDesk)      Ethereum's hard fork isn't really a hard fork in the traditional sense (CoinDesk's Valid Points newsletter)      Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein says in interview re: bitcoin: ""If I were a regulator I would be kind of hyperventilating at the success of it at the moment, and I'd be arming myself to deal with it.""

The number one cryptocurrency by market value briefly traded as low as $29,452.79 before rebounding to as high as $30,996.65 [updated] at press time, representing a near 4.5% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk 20 data. European stocks and futures tied to the S&P 500 are flashing moderate losses. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, is hovering near 90.40, representing a 0.3% gain.      The Fed Reserve is expected to leave the interest rate unchanged near zero and maintain its liquidity-boosting, bond-purchasing plan at around $120 billion/month. If so, the status-quo decision would be unlikely to elicit much of a reaction from the markets, bitcoin's included.      However, stocks and bitcoin would drop and the dollar likely draw bids, if Fed Chairman Jerome Powell drops hints of a gradual unwinding of stimulus programs.      See also: How Bitcoiners Should Watch the US Federal Reserve Meeting on Wednesday      ""BTC may face selling pressure if Powell signals an early taper,"" Darius Sit, co-founder and managing partner at Singapore-based QCP Capital, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin, considered by many a hedge against monetary and fiscal imprudence, has moved largely in opposition to the dollar index since the March markets crash.      Some may anticipate an early exit from stimulus, given that market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations have recently risen above the Fed's 2% target, while the U.S. and the global economy is now seen to be recovering at faster rate.      However, most observes, including QCP Capital's Sit, don't expect Powell to rock the boat. The Fed made it clear in August it intends to keep interest rates low for some time even after inflation climbs above 2%.      According to FXStreet's Yohay Elam, Powell may indirectly signal a willingness to buy more bonds by calling for increased fiscal (government) spending, in which case inflation hedges like bitcoin and gold could shine.      U.S. President Joe Biden is pushing for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, and the government needs to find funding for this extra debt, as noted by Elam.    Powell to curb over-exuberance?    The pandemic-era central bank stimulus has created exuberance across various asset classes, including bitcoin. In particular, stock markets are looking frothy, with some technology shares, such as GameStop, witnessing a retail frenzy.      As such, Powell may attempt to calm the markets. ""Any hint that the Fed is unwilling to continue printing money in fear of bubbles would send [markets] down,"" Elam noted.      Bitcoin is currently trading in a $30,000–$35,000 range established over the past four days, having dipped below $29,000 on Friday. Analysts foresee further sell-off on signs of weaker institutional demand.      ""Bitcoin has been trading in a tight consolidation for the past six days, with several failures to close above $32,500,"" Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. ""From a technical analysis point of view, it is consistently making lower highs. The short-term momentum indicates a possible slide to $26,000.""

42385787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOFgV,1611750600,Valid Points: What to Expect When Ethereum 2.0 Undergoes Its First 'Hard Fork',"Eth 2.0 is looking at its first hard fork this year.      The Ethereum Foundation-backed research team is currently organizing schematics for a mid-2021 backward-incompatible change to the Beacon Chain, according to a Jan. 14 developer’s call.      This hard fork is really not a hard fork in the traditional sense, Teku client project manager Ben Edgington pointed out. Rather, it’s a warmup before sharding and a merge of the Eth 1.x and Beacon Chain.      “The word ‘fork’ is heavily overloaded in blockchain usage. In fact, there shouldn't even be a fork when this upgrade is done, in the sense of the network ending up with multiple competing chains,” he wrote in his Eth 2.0 blog post on Jan. 15.      The upgrade is likely to include the following code changes, although these changes have yet to be fully agreed upon:    Infrastructure for light client support through sync committees. Light clients enable verification of the chain without needing as much overhead as a typical validator rig.  A new function, called balance_denominator, changing in-activity penalties against non-participating validators. The current penalty method is a denial-of-service (DOS) vector while the new function increases the chain’s efficiency, Eth 2.0 researcher Danny Ryan wrote on GitHub.  Rewards will be calculated over an epoch (similar to a block) instead of after the epoch closes as is currently done. Egington notes the change should help limit the number of incorrect attestations.  Ice Age on Eth 2.0?    One additional feature that is being considered is the inclusion of the difficulty bomb, also known as the “Ice Age.” The difficulty bomb – which kicks into gear at pre-set block heights – is a mining adjustment mechanism originally added to the Eth 1.x blockchain in 2015. It makes mining incrementally more difficult over time in an effort to keep developers motivated to build Eth 2.0.      To date, the Ice Age has been postponed three times on the proof-of-work (PoW) Ethereum blockchain in the Byzantium (2017), Constantinople (2019) and Muir Glacier (2020) hard forks.      The difficulty bomb is a staple of Ethereum as it pushes economic incentives on developers to keep innovating on the baselayer. Yet, it’s unlikely to be included in Eth 2.0 as there’s already an economic force pushing Beacon Chain development, Ryan told CoinDesk in a yet-to-be-released Mapping Out Eth 2.0 podcast.      “There is no Ice Age on the Beacon Chain, but it essentially has a forcing function because right now there is 2.5 million ETH locked into the system,” Ryan said. “There’s no way developers in the community at that order of magnitude would allow it to live in parallel and not have it do anything more.”      The decision to include or not include a difficulty adjustment feature like the Ice Age into Eth 2.0 itself comes down to how you see the Ethereum blockchain progressing after Eth 2.0 is complete, he said. Some want further innovation while some think ossification similar to Bitcoin’s blockchain is the way to go.      “Some want to continue to upgrade and iterate and bring in the latest cryptography into Layer 1. I’m sure the debate whether an Ice Age should exist in Ethereum 2.0 will center around some of those ideas of ossification versus continual upgrades,” Ryan said.    Eth 2.0 reaches all-time high for network participation    The Ethereum 2.0 network continues to grow at a steady pace and at near-perfect user participation levels. On Saturday, Jan. 23, Eth 2.0 reached its highest daily average network participation rate at 99.46%. This indicates that, despite a growing number of participants, validators on Eth 2.0 are largely engaged in securing the network and earning rewards.      As background, the economics of Ethereum 2.0 operates on a sliding scale of rewards that adjusts dynamically based on the total number of active validators. The larger the number of validators staked on Eth 2.0, the lower the total amount of rewards issued on the network. (Read more about Eth 2.0’s monetary policy here.)      The daily average of rewards earned per validator dipped to a seven-week low on Thursday, Jan. 21, at 0.007235 ETH. However, due to the bullish price activity of ether in the crypto markets, the value of rewards earned on the network has increased 81.47% over the same time period. In other words, because the ETH price has risen, validators are earning more on average per day in U.S. dollar (USD) terms.    Breakdown of Eth 2.0 user deposits    One other useful metric for evaluating ongoing network health and decentralization is the breakdown of user deposits on Eth 2.0. According to a tool still in beta testing by blockchain explorer Etherscan, roughly 50% of all ETH deposits are made by cryptocurrency exchanges and staking pools.      This suggests an equal balance between individuals choosing to stake using their own hardware and software and those who choose to rely on a service provider to do it for them. Shifts in this distribution over time will indicate growing advantages as well as disadvantages, swaying users towards one method of staking on Eth 2.0 versus another.      For now, the even distribution of Eth 2.0 depositors is a strong indicator that running hardware independently versus relying on a provider to do it for you are both equally attractive options for users.

42385781,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOFXh,1611749465,Lawsuit Against Israeli Crypto Entrepreneur Moshe Hegog Fails in US Court,"Israeli businessman Moshe Hegog was victorious in court last Friday when a U.S. judge dismissed a case brought by an investor who bought tokens for his predictions platform Stox.      Hogeg and STX Technologies (Stox) were sued in late 2019 by Seattle-based investor Sean Snyder, who had bought STX tokens on the platform to make predictions but later sold them at a loss of nearly $500,000.      Snyder had alleged in his complaint that he had bought the tokens based on statements by the defendants and that they were responsible for his losses. The suit accused Hogeg and Stox of fraud, making misleading claims and breach of contract.      However, Snyder failed to bring a case that backed up his allegations to the satisfaction of the Washington Western District Court at Tacoma. The plaintiff's proposed second amended complaint ""fails to identify the 'time, place and substance' of the alleged fraudulent or misleading assertions that are the basis for his claims,"" wrote District Judge Robert J. Bryan in his motion to dismiss. ""It contains vague assertions and conclusory statements of law. It is not sufficient.""      The proposed amended complaint also undermined Snyder's own case because it said he had bought the STX tokens from a third party, not from the defendants. As such, his claim to file a further complaint was denied as ""futile.""      The case has now been dismissed, with Judge Bryan saying: ""The Plaintiff has now been given three opportunities to file a complaint that states a claim on which relief could be granted. He has once again failed. It has become 'clear that the deficiencies of the complaint could not be cured by amendment.'""      Also read: What the Holy Land Reveals About Bitcoin      In early 2019, Hegog and Stox were also facing a lawsuit in Tel Aviv from a Chinese investor who alleged Hogeg had misappropriated some of the crypto millions invested in the firm. He was later given two months to settle the dispute.

Jerry Ji Guo, 33, was handed a six-month sentence by U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman and ordered to pay nearly $4.4 million in restitution after he had pleaded guilty to initial coin offering (ICO) fraud.      During the height of the ICO craze in 2018, Guo represented himself to clients as an ICO consultant, offering to perform marketing and consultancy services on behalf of cryptocurrency startups.      Instead of performing his duties as promised, Guo embezzled clients' cash and cryptocurrency. He was indicted by a federal grand jury for the crime in November 2018.      The San Francisco man pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in August 2019. He had been charged on a further seven counts but the additional charges were dismissed. Guo was potentially on the hook for 20 years in prison if he was found guilty of all charges, the Daily Beast reported at the time.      In 2019, the U.S. government obtained a stipulated application for a preliminary order of forfeiture and also obtained warrants to seize Guo's client's funds. Per a final order of forfeiture, and with the assistance of Guo, the U.S. government is now in a position to restore stolen property to victims.      See also: Two Arrested for Orchestrating Escape of Wirecard Exec Accused of Fraud      The current value of the stolen cash and cryptocurrency is estimated to be over $20 million, according to the DOJ.      “This case shows we can use criminal forfeiture to compensate fraud victims even when cryptocurrency is used in the fraud,"" said U.S. Attorney David Anderson.

42385767,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOFJr,1611734400,EY’s Paul Brody Expects Consumer DeFi Ignition in 2021,"Chief among EY blockchain lead Paul Brody’s predictions for 2021: Financial institutions will bring decentralized finance (DeFi) to a consumer audience.      “If I had to make a bold prediction,” Brody told CoinDesk last week, “I think by the end of 2021 at least one major financial institution will up the game on everybody else by offering some form of consumer DeFi, accessible through their single transactional window to a large consumer base.”      Bold indeed. Large institutions may be warming to digital assets but DeFi, the surging bricolage of crypto lending platforms (with a total value locked of over $25 billion), is not for the uninitiated.      EY’s blockchain team is always talking to banks and enterprise players, said Brody, and large companies are seeing things like Square’s published bitcoin numbers for its Cash App (growing at 700% per annum), and they want a piece.      Brody has gained kudos for his close attention to privacy tech like zero-knowledge proofs, and how such techniques can help bring public blockchains within the firewalls of big businesses. Most recently, Brody teamed with ConsenSys engineer John Wolpert to create the Baseline Protocol, an Ethereum-based reconciliation system for enterprise firms.    Read more: Microsoft, EY and ConsenSys Tout New Way for Big Biz to Use Public Ethereum    Asked which large companies he sees launching consumer DeFi, Brody believes this will emerge via app services: the Robinhoods, PayPals and Publics of the world.      “It's going to be one of the newer-generation app services that are busy integrating everything within a single transactional window, where you can buy crypto, you can have bank deposits, you can buy stocks, etc.,” Brody said.      That said, industrializing DeFi connectivity is not going to be a free-for-all, Brody added. “It will be a very carefully curated set of offerings, and firms will have to really think through how they explain and sell these things to the general public.”    Key ingredients    Two major catalysts will help this DeFi conversion take place, according to Brody. Firstly, the testing, auditing and hardening of smart contracts; secondly, the inclusion of regulated stablecoins in the space.      “Regulated stablecoins will make it a more mature sector for institutional investors and for the big money to come in,” said Brody. “And while some traders think the volatility of crypto is a feature, not a bug, the value proposition of DeFi isn't based on the volatility of crypto.
