The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization gained during the U.S. session along with stocks, rising as traders tempered bets the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by a full percentage point – considered extreme – at a meeting later this month. Higher interest rates theoretically should make high-risk assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks less attractive as investments, so crypto traders are following the economic data closely.  ""We are still constructive on crypto-asset prices in [the second half] but likely have some residual macro murkiness to navigate through in the near term,"" Sean Farrell, vice president for digital-asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote Thursday.  The fallout continued from the industry's first-half slump, with bitcoin still trading at less than a third of the all-time high price around $69,000 reached in late 2021.  A day after the troubled crypto lender Celsius Network filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., the firm filed court documents acknowledging a $1.2 billion hold in its balance sheet. CoinDesk also reported that Celsius' mining unit last month auctioned off thousands of newly purchased mining computers, and prices for the ""rigs,"" as they're known, have slumped to near two-year lows.  The non-fungible token (NFT) trading platform OpenSea laid off roughly 20% of its staff.

Co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies have been ordered to compile a list of the cash and crypto the company has access to, but there’s also the question of related entities.  As Three Arrows Capital cratered under the immense pressure of one of the sharpest crypto declines in history, its over-the-counter trading desk, Tai Ping Shan (TPS) Capital, kept on trading. While the company was once described on LinkedIn as ""the official OTC desk of Three Arrows Capital,"" it has since changed the language to distance the two firms and has publicly claimed its “independence” from Three Arrows.  A CoinDesk investigation found that despite the earlier language on the front end (still preserved by Google) claiming a relationship, on the back end there is a concerted effort to create a legal firewall between the two companies through a constellation of registered companies in Singapore, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands.  Yuankai Lin, a partner at RPC Singapore, a global law firm, told CoinDesk that Three Arrows’ creditors are going to face an uphill battle.  Lin said their case will depend on whether a court can be convinced that Three Arrows and TPS Capital were managed as a “functional whole.”  “Creditors will have to show that TPS Capital and [Three Arrows] are not truly independent from each other and that the directing mind behind TPS Capital is in fact” Three Arrows, Lin said to CoinDesk via email. “They will have to present that the separate ownership of the companies is a facade designed to evade legal obligations or to conceal the true state of affairs.”  Courts will decide  Even if creditors were able to prove that TPS Capital is an effective subsidiary of Three Arrows — Lin said that ""in substance, TPS Capital is effectively a subsidiary of Three Arrows"" — that might not be enough to win a case.  ""A holding company is legally entitled to set up subsidiaries in order to minimize its liabilities. Creditors will need to show that [Three Arrows] and TPS Capital were managed as a functional whole,” Lin said.  On the topic of controlling minds and functional wholes, it should be noted the firm being liquidated is Three Arrows Capital’s British Virgin Islands entity.  Filings from Singapore’s corporate registrar show the firm's shares are held by Zhu and Davies entirely. Three Arrows is thought to control significant assets, considering that documentation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows it split its nearly $1 billion (in January 2021 value) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust purchase between the Singapore and BVI entities. (Digital Currency Group is the parent company of Grayscale and CoinDesk.)  Lin said that in order for the liquidators, and thus creditors of Three Arrows BVI, to get their hands on Three Arrows’ Singapore assets, there would need to be a determination by the court that the Singapore entity is a subsidiary — thus an asset — of the BVI corporation.  Lifting the corporate veil  “The starting position is that Three Arrows Singapore is not an asset of Three Arrows BVI or U.S., and the bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. and liquidation proceedings in the BVI will not affect Three Arrows Singapore,” Lin said. “There is a possibility that the liquidators, having looked deeper into the parent company, may seek a ruling from the court to lift the corporate veil and to look at the directing mind(s) behind Three Arrows Singapore.”  One outcome, according to Lin, is the court may find that the separate ownership of the companies is a facade designed to evade legal obligations or to conceal the true state of affairs. If that’s the case, a court could rule that Three Arrows Singapore was “in substance a subsidiary.”  “To the Singapore courts, how the relationship [among the BVI, U.S., and Singapore entities] is described on the companies’ website or publicity materials would not matter,” Lin said. “The real test is of the actual relationship between the entities, and the court will consider whether there is real evidence that Three Arrows Singapore is in actuality a subsidiary.”  Alternatively, the court might consider whether all the entities are in effect being controlled by the same parties and were “alter egos of this same controlling mind.”  Lin noted that prior jurisprudence in Singapore on this topic will likely work in Three Arrows’ favor.  “It should be noted that cases of the corporate veil being lifted are few and far between as the courts are generally very respectful of the separate legal personality doctrine,” he concluded.

HIVE offers an acceptable margin of safety in terms of price to hard assets in excess of the total liabilities ratio, even though IREN still trumps in this aspect. HIVE is truly a low-cost operator by achieving an actual best-in-class cost structure which stands at only $22,500 per BTC which is 35% lower than the sector average. The catch lies in HIVE's delayed report even though we expect HIVE to maintain its low cost operations in 2022Q1 and 2022Q2. HIVE is our current prime go-to crypto mining company to invest in when Bitcoin shows signs of recovery, assuming no material changes to HIVE in the future. Introduction We've been in the market searching for crypto mining companies that can provide alpha. We've covered the likes of Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ), Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Iris Energy (IREN), Soluna Holdings ( SLNH ), Core Scientific ( CORZ ), and Bitfarms ( BITF ). Our prerequisites for a crypto mining company to be investable is to be 100% powered by renewable energies. By this standard, only IREN and SLNH made the cut. IREN's investment proposition is centered around being priced near the value of its total hard assets (cash, land, and grid-connected power facilities). The problem with IREN is that its total mining cost isn't as efficient as other miners. On the other hand, not only SLNH's mining cost is inefficient, it is limited to the availability of curtailed renewable energy . Since we expect the curtailed renewable energy to shrink over time, SLNH's business prospects will also be limited. BITF's mining operation is much more efficient than IREN and SLNH. Unfortunately, BITF's Bitcoin mining operations in Argentina are powered by natural gas. Hence, it is disqualified from being 100% powered by renewable energy. The same goes for RIOT and MARA for being only carbon-neutral and not 100% powered by renewables yet. What we want to find out in this article is whether HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) can fill in the gap and offer IREN-level sufficient margin of safety with leading mining efficiency. HIVE is Strategically On Point The first thing investors can see on HIVE's homepage is the following statement: ... The company uses 100% green energy to mine both Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a committed ESG strategy since day one. HIVE strives to create long-term shareholder value with its unique HODL strategy ... This statement has 2 very big implications for us. It confirms that HIVE aligns with our view of what makes a crypto mining company investable. Firstly, the first statement affirms that the company is aware of ESG risks from day one. The ESG risk is a material one. Core Scientific acknowledges it in its official fillings: Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders, customers, government regulators and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks. To our knowledge, one way to be ESG-compliant is to be carbon neutral. For crypto miners to be carbon neutral means to absorb the same amount of carbon emitted throughout mining operation. If the carbon cannot be absorbed locally, it can be offset in another region through methods such as afforestation (e.g., buying plots of land to plant trees). The problem with carbon offsets is the method of measuring how much carbon is absorbed. Any changes in the measurement technique could risk the company's ESG compliance. Therefore, HIVE's 100% green energy strategy is on point. Secondly, crypto mining companies act as proxies for the underlying asset mined. Crypto mining companies should maximize asset retention. The more the crypto mining companies hold the assets in reserve, the more valuable they are. In fact, it is one of the key metrics in our valuation framework . Based on these 2 aspects, HIVE is indeed strategically on point for us. HIVE met our prerequisites and resonates with us. Good Margin of Safety and Best-in-Class Efficiency As per HIVE's latest quarter report (CY2021Q4), HIVE managed to mine 1220 equivalent Bitcoins ( 697 Bitcoins and 7,126 Ethereum). HIVE's all-in business cost which consists of Operation and Maintenance, Depreciation, General and Administrative Expenses, Shared-based Compensation, and Financial Expenses totaled $27.4mil. This implies that HIVE's total all-in business cost per BTC-equivalent mined is only $22,500 (Table 1). If non-cash expenses (depreciation and share-based compensation) are excluded, HIVE's total all-in business cash cost per BTC equivalent is only $8,900. To put this into perspective, HIVE's all-in cost remains the lowest when compared to the 7 other crypto mining companies we've covered so far (Table 1). HIVE's total all-in business cost per BTC equivalent is also consistently low over the past 2 other quarters (CY2021Q3 and CY2021Q2) at $17,842 and $23,468 respectively (Table 2). The same goes for HIVE's total all-in business cash cost per BTC equivalent in CY2021Q3 and CY2021Q2 at $8,856 and $11,475 respectively. We seldom deem a crypto mining business cost as low. This is the lowest we've seen. Table 1. All-in Business Cost per BTC Equivalent mined Companies All-in Business Cost Per BTC Equivalent mined HIVE $22,500 BITF $34,340.00 CORZ $35,816.00 SLNH $54,000-$64500* IREN $39,355.00 RIOT $30,800.00 MARA $31,700.00 Source: Author, HIVE *Excluding Hosting, Range Depending on how shared costs are pro-rated between hosting and self-mining (proprietary) Table 2.

HIVE's reserve also has 3,239 BTC and 7,667 ETH as per the June 2022 update and is worth $70.5mil as of the time of writing. Hence, these assets are worth about $330mil. These assets in excess of total liabilities ($55.1mil) are worth $280mil. HIVE's market cap as of the time of writing is $260mil, which is about 10% lower than HIVE's assets (cash + reserves + deposits + equipment) in excess of total liabilities. Comparatively , BITF is traded at around a similar metric while IREN is trading around 55% lower than the similar metric. Hence, IREN's margin of safety remains the best. That being said, HIVE's margin of margin is good and acceptable. The Catch The catch mentioned in the title of this article is the date. HIVE's data is based on 2021Q4 while other miners mentioned in Table 1 are based on 2022Q1. This catch is significant because the crude oil price jumped from about $77 to nearly $130 per barrel while the natural gas price increased from $4 to nearly $6 in 2022Q1. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts However, we have reasons to believe that this cost will be maintained. By referring to Table 2, we can see that the only cost that materially increased is depreciation, while all other costs such as operating and maintenance, general and administrative, share-based compensations, and financials remain relatively consistent. Furthermore, HIVE is 100% renewable energy. Hence, we do not expect HIVE to incur materially higher costs in 2022Q1 and 2022Q2. Valuation HIVE is priced relatively closer to BITF and IREN. So let's use BITF and IREN as comps. HIVE's expected near future capacity is about 38% to 60% lower than IREN's (depending on early or end of 2023), but is priced 40% higher. This premium might be contributed from HIVE's 3x higher built-up capacity (meaning less execution risk), and 50% lower total all-in business cost per BTC. Only time will tell whether IREN's cost can reach economic of scale. Contrary to popular belief, we explained why crypto mining companies might not achieve economies of scale in our previous coverage on BITF . Nevertheless, we think that IREN provide investors with better upside opportunity if investors are willing to undertake more risk. To our knowledge, IREN has not proven its ability to retain its Bitcoins mined as IREN does not have Bitcoin reserves yet while HIVE has a good track record to prove its ability. Moreover, we showed that a crypto mining company's capacity growth is somewhat similar across the sector at 8.5% or 0.4 EH/s -1 EH/s per quarter. By this standard IREN might be able to achieve its targeted capacity of 10 EH/s from the current 1 EH/s. Hence the risk. On the other hand, HIVE is priced about 10% higher than BITF despite having similar built-up capacity and expected capacity of 6 EH/s in 2023. Given that HIVE is 100% powered by renewable energy and HIVE's all-in business cost is 35% lower than BITF, this 10% premium is well justified. Just remember that the catch mentioned in the previous section. Furthermore, HIVE shareholders suffered less dilution than BITF shareholders despite HIVE's $100mil ATM Equity Program . HIVE shareholders only suffered 11% dilution in 2021 while BITF shareholders suffered 33%. In terms on potentially dilutive securities, HIVE only has 6% potential dilution while BITF has more than 15% (from outstanding stock options and warrants). Comparatively, CORZ has 66% potential dilution from potentially dilutive securities. This further justifies HIVE's 10% premium over BITF. Data by YCharts Table 3. Built-up and Expected Near Future Capacities of Mining Companies Company Built-up Capacity Near Future Expected Capacity Hive Blockchain ( HIVE ) 3.2* 6 Bitfarms ( BITF ) 3.3 8 Core Scientific ( CORZ ) 8.3 ~16 Soluna Holdings ( SLNH ) 1 4 Iris Energy ( IREN ) 1.1 10 Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) 4.3 12.8 Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 3.9 23.3 Source: Author * Including BTC-equivalent capacity for Ethereum Verdict Aside from the recent notice of deficiency from NASDAQ, we only have good things to say about HIVE. HIVE has lesser ESG compliance risk (powered by 100% renewable energy), growing Bitcoin reserves, acceptable margin of safety in terms of price to hard assets excess of total liabilities ratio, and significantly lower all-in business cost per BTC by sector standards. Although HIVE's near future expected capacity isn't a wow factor like IREN's, HIVE's expectation is closer to the realistic historic sector growth rate. That being said, we think that it is still early to get into HIVE as Bitcoin is expected to decline further to $10,000 by end of 2022. This has been our stance since May 2021 and is evident by Bitcoin's decade-old halving cycle as well as current economic fundamentals.

42422755,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p77h,1657832988,Bitcoin Mining Rig Prices Slump to Near 2-Year Lows Amid Celsius Bankruptcy,"The bear market continues to hit the bitcoin (BTC) mining industry hard, with the prices of the latest generation of mining rigs tumbling to 2020 lows.  Bitmain’s Antminer S19 and S19 Pro are catching bids around $20-$23 per terahash (TH), according to one application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) trading desk. For comparison, these models were priced around $40/TH in recent months, and as high as $119/TH last year, according to Luxor Mining’s Hashrate Index data.  The $20-$23/TH range is something the industry hasn't seen since around the time of the 2020 bitcoin price bottom. In addition to Bitmain’s S19, S19j and S19 Pro units, MicroBTC’s Whatsminer M30s, M30s+ and M30s++ models, among others, are feeling the slump as well.  The bear market pricing is being compounded by the recent bankruptcy filing of the Celsius Mining alongside parent company Celsius Network. A person familiar with the situation told CoinDesk that Celsius Mining auctioned off thousands of its newly purchased mining rigs in June, with the first batch of 6,000 selling for $28/TH and a second group of 5,000 changing hands at $22/TH. According to Hashrate Index data, mining rigs that month were trading from $50-$60/TH.  One broker told CoinDesk the average prices for newer S19j Pro models are now around $25/TH.  Read more: As Bitcoin Price Slides, Older Mining Rigs Are Becoming Less Profitable  ""With additional machines hitting the market, we expect prices to decrease $1-$2/TH across new-generation machines,"" said Luxor COO Ethan Vera. ""There are a number of mining companies that will need to liquidate portion of their fleets, providing additional pressure on ASIC prices.""  However, he added, the drop in rig prices might find some support near the current market rate. ""We see a heavy wall of bids, in the $18-$20/TH range, that will provide a resistance level to ASIC prices at current economics.""  Read more: Bear Market Could See Some Crypto Miners Turning to M&A for Survival  Celsius Mining has been active in the industry via investing and lending as well as helping host the miners to which it lends. Last year Celsius Mining said it invested a total of $500 million for its bitcoin mining operations in North America and was reported to have about 22,000 ASIC miners, most of which are Bitmain’s newest generation of AntMiner S19 series.  Amid the rig price drop and continued bear market, Bitmain has begun offering a reward coupon program for some customers who meet certain criteria, according to a blog post by the manufacturer. “In the midst of crypto winter, Bitmain is launching a reward coupon program to share our gratitude toward your continuous support,” said the company.  The reward coupons allow for deductions of up to 30% of the total order amount and are available for mining rigs from July 2022 or later, the post added.

42411776,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfhCF,1657832974,Trust Wallet 101: How to Get Started,"Trust Wallet is a free, non-custodial mobile wallet for storing cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFT). It is categorized as a hot wallet because it is directly connected to the internet. The app is only available on iOS and Android devices and is relatively simple to set up and use.  Trust Wallet was acquired by Binance in 2018 to be its official decentralized wallet. It has the ability to store over 4.5 million digital assets and supports over 65 blockchains. Being a popular wallet among traders and investors, it has been downloaded over 30 million times to date.  Though Binance’s Trust Wallet is compatible with various blockchains, Trust Wallet distinguishes itself from other popular wallets due to its interoperability with virtually all platforms based on Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) such as PancakeSwap.  Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet  What can you do with Trust Wallet?  Swap: You can easily exchange one crypto for another.  Buy: You can buy cryptocurrencies with your credit card via third-party platforms such as MoonPay or Simplex.  Stake: You can earn interest through Trust Wallet’s staking function or by accessing a menu of decentralized applications (dapps).  Store: You can store your crypto on various blockchain networks.  Collect: You can collect NFTs by using Trust Wallet’s dapp browser to access popular NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea or Rarible.  How to get started and create a Trust Wallet account  Once you download the app, there are a few simple steps to get started.  1. Select “Create a new wallet” and press “Continue” to accept the terms. Get a pencil and paper ready because the warning Trust Wallet gives you is real: If you lose your recovery words (sometimes also known as a seed phrase or recovery phrase) you may lose access to your wallet and the crypto within it forever.  2. A new screen will appear, prompting you to write down your recovery phrase. It is important you manually write it down and keep it in a safe, private place. Keeping the words in digital form is less secure and not recommended.  3. The recovery phase for Trust Wallet consists of 12 words. These words will be used in case you lose access to your wallet – and they are the only way to regain access to the wallet. So we’ll say it again: Keep them in a safe, private place.  Read More: Why Your Seed Phrase Is So Important  4. To verify that you backed up your recovery phrases, Trust Wallet will prompt you to write them in sequential order as you’ve received them.  5. You will get a screen stating, “Your wallet was successfully created.”  How to fund your Trust Wallet  Buying tokens in Trust Wallet  1. Now that you have your wallet, you’ll want to get some crypto into it. Start on the home screen by pressing the button labeled “Receive.”  2. You will now be brought to a screen where you need to select which cryptocurrency you want to receive. For our example, we’ll use BNB Smart Chain.  3. You can press “Buy” to enter a payment gateway to purchase BNB with your credit card.  4. Upon pressing the “Buy” button you can input the amount you want to buy in U.S. dollars, as the screenshot below shows (in the blue box), and choose the payment gateway such as MoonPay (shown in the red box).  Transferring tokens to Trust Wallet  1. If you opted not to buy tokens yet, you can also transfer tokens to your wallet. The process is similar to buying tokens. So, go to the home screen and press the button labeled “Receive.”  2. Then, you will be brought to a menu screen of cryptos where you select which cryptocurrency you want to receive. For our example, we’ll use BNB Smart Chain again.  3. Finally, press the middle button, “Receive,” to transfer your tokens to that address, as in the screenshot below.  Using decentralized apps with Trust Wallet  Once you create your wallet account, you will notice a variety of buttons with different functionalities at your disposal such as having access to dapps to perform various transactions, as shown in the screenshot below.  These functionalities make Trust Wallet a Swiss Army knife type of solution for decentralized finance (DeFi). The one thing you can’t do within Trust Wallet is to exchange your crypto assets into fiat currency the way you can on exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase.  Who should use Trust Wallet?  Trust Wallet is beginner-friendly but also has options that will satisfy more advanced users with functionality for DeFi and NFTs.  Having the option to store a wide array of cryptocurrencies within Trust Wallet makes it an appealing choice for those who want an all-in-one solution for managing their portfolio in the palm of their hands.",NEUTRAL,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Mike Antolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/trust-wallet-101-how-to-get-started,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19397b94c2074f10cf855077fe9ea433f41b8aaa-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On-chain metrics show good growth in wallet holders and NFT buyers. Polygon has the highest TVL of the Ethereum scaling chains. While the biggest story in the financial markets yesterday was undoubtedly the June inflation print of 9.1%, there was another story in the crypto market that was largely ignored by many of the traditional financial media outlets. Disney ( DIS ) just announced the latest participants in its Accelerator program and Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) was one of the selected companies. I think this is a fairly big deal and the crypto market action yesterday seems to indicate that many others agree. 5 Day Performance (Seeking Alpha) Despite a highly negative reaction to the CPI number more broadly speaking, MATIC has seen a nice run over the last 24 hours and has enjoyed some separation from top dogs like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) since the Disney announcement. While I think it's probably likely that the gain in MATIC could get faded if the broad market continues to struggle, since my last article about Polygon was five months ago , I think the Disney news is a big enough catalyst to revisit the Polygon thesis. What is the Disney Accelerator program? Simply put, Disney's Accelerator program is a months-long brainstorming session for growth-stage companies that have an innovative vision for the entertainment industry. The teams that are selected to join the program get access to a co-working space in Los Angeles where they can collaborate on new ideas during the summer. Following this summer period of idea-sharing, the companies in the program present what they've come up with in October during what is called ""Demo Day."" This is how Disney describes the goal of the program: Through the Disney Accelerator, select companies will gain access to the range of creative expertise and resources of The Walt Disney Company to help them develop new entertainment experiences and products. In addition to the co-working space, the companies that get into the Accelerator program get capital for investment and access to Disney executives and entrepreneurs for support and guidance. The two most well-known success stories from the program in the past are probably Epic Games and Kahoot!. It's an interesting program, and I think it's a big deal that Polygon was selected. Who will Polygon be collaborating with? The other companies that will be working with Polygon in this year's Accelerator program are interesting because they all seem to share a Web 3/Metaverse type of product set. Here's the list of the five other companies with a brief explainer of what they are: Flickplay - social media app with NFT/AR components Inworld - AI character-based gaming/metaverse experiences Lockerverse: Web3 creator platform Obsess: virtual 3D store builder Red 6: AR headset company Right off the bat, Flickplay looks like an obvious potential collaborator because of the NFT aspects of the platform. That said, I think this is a well-curated group that could potentially have quite a bit of synergy in creating an innovative product for Disney. In my opinion, businesses that have content and collectible segments are probably going to be among the biggest winners in the Web 3 space, and a company like Disney has arguably the most valuable content IP library in the entire media space. I think the selection of Polygon and these other five companies is a clear indication that Disney is thinking about much more than just growing a streaming business for incremental revenue. Polygon's Network Activity From a raw network activity standpoint, I think we're seeing decent metrics across the board in the on-chain data. For starters, wallets with non-zero balances continue to move higher. Coinmetrics Year to date, we've seen a 39% increase in non-zero wallet addresses from a little under 332k addresses to over 460k addresses now. This has no doubt been driven at least partly by the NFT activity happening on Polygon. Cryptoslam According to Cryptoslam, there have been at least 3,000 unique NFT buyers on the Polygon network 34 of the last 43 days. That's the largest stretch of unique buyers of that magnitude since the chain launched. We can really get a sense of the performance over the last two months by showing this data reflected as monthly averages. Below is the average daily unique buyers by month. Cryptoslam April is a clear outlier month that is likely skewed by a high-demand project or mint. With that as an exception, the growth over the last two months has been tremendous. The June average was up nearly double the average in December and more than 10 times the average from June 2021. Considering the crypto market has broadly been collapsing over the last couple of months, the network activity despite the doomy-looking price optics should be a good sign that this NFT buying via Polygon is a reflection of sustainable network adoption. That said, that's just the NFT aspect of the network. The total daily transactions are down year to date. polygonscan Purely from a network transactions standpoint, Polygon has been essentially basing over the last few months with daily transactions generally falling somewhere between 2 million and 4 million each day. While this is well off highs, it's still significantly ahead of what Ethereum does on a typical day. Comparison to Peers My biggest attraction to Polygon back in February was the realization that it was quickly becoming a viable chain for decentralized app developers. In that article, I compared Polygon's market cap rank to four other Ethereum scaling chains. Those layer 2 networks were Loopring ( LRC-USD ), OMG Network ( OMG-USD ), Immutable X ( IMX-USD ), and SKALE Network ( SKL-USD ).

From a DeFi perspective, Polygon even holds its own against layer 1 blockchains that are competing with Ethereum directly. Here are the top 10 blockchains ranked by Total Value Locked: Rank Name Protocols TVL 1 Ethereum 512 $46.74b 2 Binance ( BNB-USD ) 422 $6.11b 3 Tron ( TRON-USD ) 10 $5.7b 4 Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) 229 $2.75b 5 Solana ( SOL-USD ) 72 $2.56b 6 Polygon 273 $1.64b 7 Cronos ( CRO-USD ) 70 $1.2b 8 Waves ( WAVES-USD ) 5 $839.36m 9 Fantom ( FTM-USD ) 252 $819.2m 10 Arbitrum 95 $660.9m Source: DeFiLlama Not only is Polygon the top-ranked layer 2 chain in the top 10, but it also claims the third most protocols building on the network. This would indicate there is an ease of adoption on the developer end in addition to the adoption seen from NFT and DeFi end users. Risks Like all things crypto, MATIC has risks. Year over year inflation printed 9.1% for the month of June. There are now some who are calling for a Federal Reserve rate increase of 100 bps. As rates have increased, risk assets have sold off considerably. Recession concerns are a factor as well as a broad economic slowdown might force companies like Disney to position themselves defensively. This could be to the detriment of innovation initiatives like building out blockchain-based products. Summary Polygon is a top 5 position in the crypto portfolio that I share with BlockChain Reaction subscribers. I rank it that high because I think it can help facilitate broader blockchain adoption at both the user and developer levels. Polygon is quickly becoming one of the most utilized blockchains in the space. Even after the retreat from daily transaction highs a few months ago, at 2 to 4 million per day, Polygon is handling 2 to 3 times the daily transactions of Ethereum on a daily basis. Finally, I think Polygon's acceptance into Disney's Accelerator program has the potential to generate something really special in the foreseeable future.

42422752,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p71h,1657829984,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Surges as Fed Governor Talks Down 100 Basis Point Rate Hike,"Hi, I'm Jimmy He, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin surged in Thursday trading after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said he supported an interest rate hike of 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point) in July, easing fears of a larger 100 basis-point raise to combat high inflation.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at around $2,680, up 4.8% in the past 24 hours.  Traders of Federal funds on the CME exchange now see a 56% likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise the target interest rate by 75 basis points to a range of 2.25%-2.5% this month. A day earlier, the odds were seen at 20% after an unusually hot Consumer Price Index reading for June prompted traders to shift their bets to a 100 basis-point increase.  VGX, the native token of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital, tripled in price over three days in a short squeeze, reaching a high of 95 cents on July 13. An unknown firm named MetaFormLabs contributed to VGX’s rally, tweeting about a “#PumpVGXJuly18” plan with a $5 target price point for July 18.  “That's an ambitious goal considering Voyager's problems. Besides, crypto pump schemes have a bad reputation for being exit strategies for whales and scammers and trapping retail investors on the wrong side of the market,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported.  VGX has since slumped back to around 46 cents, down 52% from its Wednesday high.  Most altcoins were in the green, with Uniswap’s UNI token leading market gains. UNI spiked 21% over the past 24 hours after being added to broker Robinhood’s crypto listings.  Polygon’s MATIC token spiked 19% after the Ethereum scaling tool was selected to participate in Disney’s 2022 Accelerator program.  Ethereum rose 10% as the network’s ninth shadow fork went live amid testing for its upcoming Merge.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Celsius Joins the Bankruptcy Club  Celsius Network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Wednesday, becoming the third liquidity-strapped crypto lender to do so in July, following Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital.  “This is the right decision for our community and company,” Celsius co-founder and CEO Alex Mashinsky said in a statement on Wednesday. “We have a strong and experienced team in place to lead Celsius through this process. I am confident that when we look back at the history of Celsius, we will see this as a defining moment, where acting with resolve and confidence served the community and strengthened the future of the company.”  During the past couple of weeks Celsius has been paying off all of its debt to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms Maker, Aave and Compound, freeing up locked collateral.  Celsius said in a statement the firm has “$167 million in cash on hand” to provide liquidity and “support certain operations during the restructuring process.”  Celsius has also filed a series of motions to continue operations as usual, including “requests to pay employees and continue their benefits without disruption.” However, the crypto lender said that it will not be “requesting authority to allow customer withdrawals at this time.”  In June CoinDesk quoted people familiar with the situation saying Goldman Sachs (GS) was seeking to raise $2 billion from investors to buy distressed Celsius assets if the company declared bankruptcy. The investment banking firm has not confirmed any further actions yet.  Celsius’ CEL token plummeted to a low of 44 cents within hours of filing for bankruptcy and is now trading at around 76 cents, 18% down in the last 24 hours.

42421482,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUl3,1657829808,"No, Mt. Gox Payouts Aren’t Going to Torpedo Bitcoin's Price","As Voyager Digital and Celsius Network customers scream, “Where the hell’s my money?” Mt. Gox creditors must feel like James Franco’s nameless character in “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” who asks his neighbor at the gallows, “First time?”  After eight years of holding the bag, creditors of the famed, failed bitcoin (BTC) exchange may soon get at least a sliver of their money back. While that might sound like good news at a time when the crypto market could really use some, some are worried about the prospect of Mt. Gox customers dumping their newly reclaimed BTC. While the situation bears watching, such fears may be overblown.  Let’s back up a bit.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Last week, the trustee who is carrying out a plan to make Mt. Gox bagholders – known in the Tokyo District Court as “rehabilitation creditors” – as whole as possible asked them to register on an online claim-filing system.  This request signaled that the trustee is preparing to make repayments under a plan approved by the creditors last year.  Read more: Voting on a Proposal to Reimburse Mt. Gox Victims Begins Today  In that registration request, creditors were asked to choose between receiving an early, partial lump sum payment or waiting until the end of civil rehabilitation on the off-chance there will be more funds available to be disbursed, meaning they’d recover a larger sum. (There’s an outstanding lawsuit by CoinLab against Mt. Gox.)  Creditors are able to choose between receiving their reimbursement in native currency (a mix of BTC, bitcoin cash and yen) or opt for the trustee to liquidate the entirety of their claim into cash. Payment dates and specific payout amounts weren’t outlined in the publicly available letter. Every creditor will also receive some of their payout in cash, even if they didn’t have any on Mt. Gox.  In short, the trustee is saying: “If you want some of the money you’re owed, get online and tell us how you want to get it.”  Will Mt. Gox creditors dump their BTC?  There is chatter about this portending a bearish situation for bitcoin. Especially when we consider what happened just last month when the Luna Foundation Guard liquidated roughly 80,000 BTC when LUNA collapsed (hint: the price went down). Since Mt. Gox lost 850,000 BTC in a hack, a creditor dump could conceivably be worse.  That said, Mt. Gox wasn’t able to get back the stolen bitcoins, so the trustee is not actually paying out 850,000 BTC to creditors. Mt. Gox only holds around 141,686 BTC, 142,846 bitcoin cash (BCH) and 69,776,002,441 yen (~$3.2 billion, all told). So instead of a one-time 850,000 BTC liquidation, a worst-case scenario would look like this: 100% of creditors opt for the trustee to liquidate, and the trustee opts to do that all in one fell swoop and sell 141,000 BTC. That represents 8.8% of total daily exchange volume. Sure, that’s meaningful, but it wouldn’t be the first time 141,000 BTC was sold in a day.  So what would it take for this worst-case scenario to happen during the current bear market cycle?  First off, all creditors would have to choose to receive the early, lump-sum payment, which is likely to be paid out in the coming months (as opposed to, potentially, years).  Then they would all have to dump all their BTC on the exchanges at once. This would mean either everyone would ask for their payouts in cash only – meaning the trustee would cash out the BTC all at once (unlikely) – or everyone would opt to get their BTC, BCH and cash combination payouts and coordinate to dump all of that bitcoin at the same time (again, unlikely).  Alternatively, and more likely, creditors will opt for some combination of the above. Some will choose the later payment option; some will want a cash-only payout; some will accept the mixed payout.  And once people do finally get their bitcoin, there is no reason to assume that everyone will dump all of it anytime soon.  One confirmed creditor told CoinDesk they will hold “whatever they get from the rehabilitation plan.” This particular creditor has watched bitcoin grow from what it was in 2014 to a global store of value with potential as a reserve asset. In 2014 bitcoin was worth less than $1,000. Bitcoin in 2014 and bitcoin in 2022 are hardly the same thing. Anecdotally, we’ve seen this sentiment echoed by other creditors we’ve contacted and by many participants in the MtGox Insolvency Discussion Subreddit.  “I hope I get the cash part of the settlement while the price is still low so I can buy more bitcoin,” another creditor told CoinDesk.  Perhaps more importantly, we know that private equity giant Fortress bought up some Mt. Gox creditor claims and so have other investment firms. If these firms opt for a payout in native currency (of course they could opt for a cash payout), then the eventual sale of that bitcoin would likely happen over the counter, meaning it wouldn’t show up in exchange volume numbers that spook traders.  Known unknowns  On top of all this, and this is the most important bit, we have no idea when these payments will happen. It’s even unlikely they will all happen at the same time, given the creditors themselves have already been broken up into four distinct categories based on the timing of their initial claims and other qualifications.  Sure, if all creditors immediately sell their coins there could be some unusually high selling of bitcoin that has been tucked away for years. The reality is that many are unlikely to do that considering the constitution of long-term bitcoin investors. Research from Coinbase suggests that long-term bitcoin investors have preserved their holdings in recent weeks as speculators flee the market. In short, honey badger don’t care.  All said, we don’t know exactly what will happen. While the worst-case scenario isn’t that bad, it probably won’t happen. All in all, any claims that Mt. Gox rehabilitation payouts will spell doom for the market are premature.",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/14/no-mt-gox-payouts-arent-going-to-torpedo-bitcoins-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f5bc1ec632691921759d464b8f27b537aa9c635-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422748,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p6th,1657828495,How Web3 Measures Digital Ownership,"Key Takeaways  Web3-based digital assets:  enable defi and trustless infrastructure;  are open and autonomous; and  and remove financial intermediaries.  A Power Shift: What is Web3  Web3 – also known as “Web 3.0” or “Web 3” – is a term that has become increasingly popular and synonymous with the next stage of internet technologies. The new stage is exemplified by advances in the development of digital assets.  Web3 describes the next generation of the internet that allows users to participate beyond reading, enabled by Web 1; and writing; enabled by Web 2.0. For example, in the 1990s, Web 1 was comprised mostly of a collection of links and homepages that were readable but not particularly interactive.  In 2004, Web 2.0, then the next evolution of the internet, allowed people to not only read content, but also create their own and publish it on blogs and various social media channels.  As people became better informed on how their personal data was collected and used by the publishing, social media, and the big tech, a greater awareness and need arose for more privacy, ownership, and control of individual information and content.  Therefore, Web3 emerged as the next iteration of the internet that aims to reduce dependency on large technology companies using decentralized protocols. Web3, therefore, can be seen as a power shift from big tech to consumers and the greater public.  Evolving Stakeholder Dynamics in Decentralized Finance  The digital assets that represent Web3 are characterized by open, autonomous, and decentralized technologies within internet ecosystems that enable trustless infrastructure and remove intermediaries and central monopolies.  This gives individual users power and ownership over their data, identity, digital assets, security, and transactions. They can participate in the governance and operation of protocols as participants and shareholders, not just customers or products.  Web3 technologies can run autonomously with no need for a centralized organization to maintain their operation; this frees up creative resources to build out a universe of decentralized financial tools and applications (dApps). Using decentralized applications, users can leverage their digital ownership and online footprint through their Web3 interactions.  Web3 Digital Assets in CoinDesk Indices' DACS  According to CoinDesk Indices’ Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), the standard for defining the industries of digital assets, Web3 is not defined as an industry, industry group or sector. Rather, it is comprised of a diverse set of digital assets across industry groups.  The index that represents digital assets within the Web3 ecosystem is called CoinDesk Industry Group Select Equal Weight Index (DIGS). DIGS measures the performance of the largest digital asset in each industry group defined by DACS that meets certain market capitalization, trading, and custody requirements. It also excludes stablecoins and meme coins.  Web3 covers a broad range of applications that extends beyond one industry, industry group, or sector within DACS. So, a digital asset is eligible for inclusion in the DACS Index Universe, if it is ranked in the top 200 in the most recent DACS report. But this is not the only requirement for inclusion in the Index.  There are two critical criteria that directly impact eligibility for inclusion in the Index: investability and liquidity. Based on these two criteria, eligible digital assets must:  have an average market cap of $1.5 billion over the seven days leading up to the reconstitution;  be listed on three eligible exchanges with custodian services available from Coinbase Custody; and  be accessible by U.S. investors.  Key Assets in DIGS  In the spirit of size, liquidity, and diversification across Industry Groups, the Index constituent selection process, which reconstitutes quarterly, targets the largest digital asset from each Industry Group, subject to a buffer rule to reduce turnover.  At its inception date of April 4, 2022, the index is made of ten digital assets included in DIGS, each representing a unique Industry Group: Oracle (LINK); Shared Storage (FIL); Private (ZEC); Transparent (BTC); Credit Platform (AAVE); DAO (MKR); Exchanges (UNI); Metaverse (MANA); Multi-Chain / Parachain (AVAX); and Single Chain (ETH).  Conclusion  Web3 is an extremely important advancement to the functionality of the internet that allows users to participate in it beyond reading and writing by owning their personal content to reduce dependency on large technology companies.  This has become possible through the use of decentralized protocols. It gives individual users power over their data, identity, digital assets, security, and transactions.  Although Web3 is not defined by DACS, it nevertheless helps investors navigate the full stack of Web3 applications through its sector, industry group, and industry taxonomy.  The CoinDesk Industry Group Select Equal Weight Index (DIGS) gives investors greater transparency into the value of digital ownership in the world of Web3 and offers a framework to them to access the most liquid and investable assets in this space.

The document, which was filed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, shows that Celsius holds $4.3 billion of assets and $5.5 billion of liabilities. In its list of assets, Celsius claimed it has about $600 million in its CEL token. However, the company noted in the filing the total market cap for CEL as of July 12 was roughly $170.3 million.  Celsius is one of several firms that have been hit hard by the ongoing liquidity crisis in the crypto sector. It halted deposit withdrawals on June 12, hired restructuring experts to advise on its financial situation and filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday.  As the firm was looking for solutions to its financial difficulties, crypto exchange FTX reportedly walked away from talks about a potential deal to acquire Celsius, pointing to a ""$2 billion hole"" on Celsius' balance sheet.  However, Celsius started to make good on its debt to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols Aave, Compound and Maker as part of a treasury-management maneuver to get a hold of its assets locked up as collateral of the loans.  The crypto lender paid off $223 million to Maker, $235 million to Aave and $258 million to Compound, closing its last loan on Tuesday, as reported by CoinDesk.  As a result, the firm was able to reclaim almost $1.4 billion in tokens, mostly held in the form of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and a type of staked ether derivative (stETH).  Ryan Preston Dahl, a restructuring expert at the law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program that Celsius is going into “uncharted territory” in filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, because there has not been a precedent for a crypto brokerage “trying to navigate through a reorganization as opposed to a liquidation.”  UPDATE (July 14, 20:08 UTC): Added detail and background throughout.

42421142,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWNJ,1657824721,"Celsius Network 'Could Stick Around' After Bankruptcy, Restructuring Expert Says","Celsius Network, a crypto lender that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday, could stick around in some form, according to one restructuring expert.  Ryan Preston Dahl, a partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that Celsius is tackling “uncharted territory.”  “There’s really no precedent for a [crypto brokerage] business like [Celsius] trying to navigate through a reorganization as opposed to a liquidation,” Dahl said.  Dahl noted that Celsius’ hybrid-like business model of lending and providing brokerage services makes it challenging to pinpoint what the company’s future will be in the coming months.  He said that banks and brokerage firms cannot file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In a traditional brokerage liquidation like that of the Lehman Brothers, “a trustee gets appointed, it administers the assets, and the brokerage goes away.” That, however, is “not the goal for Celsius.”  Dahl’s comments follow a crypto shakeout that has included bankruptcy filings by crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto broker Voyager Digital.  Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, even though its headquarters are in Hoboken, N.J.  Its choice to file in a different state than where it is based isn’t an “uncommon phenomenon,” but does raise questions about why it chose to do so.  “It’s not exactly clear what the nexus is between Celsius in New York,” Dahl said. “It appears they may have significant assets located in New York.”  Dahl said that the Southern District of New York may be a “more favorable place to file,” partly because the court is “widely regarded as one, if not the most sophisticated jurisdiction for large-scale corporate insolvencies.”  In the past, big companies, including Lehman Brothers, General Motors and Enron, filed in the Southern District of New York. Three Arrows Capital and Voyager Digital also filed in that district.  Dahl said Celsius is likely to face lots of scrutiny about its business model and will need to be prepared to disclose discussions that were going on internally, as well as how it was presenting itself to customers.  “A lot of questions can be asked about really what was going on that caused this to happen,” he said. “But at the same time, that sort of means, was this really an appropriate vehicle for retail investors to participate?”  Meanwhile, as users look to recover some of their losses, Dahl said there are no guarantees because the process “can take on a life of its own.”  “It can be many months, if not years, before creditors see recovery,” Dahl said, and before money can be distributed, questions “need to be answered and that can take time.”  Read more: Celsius Network Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/14/celsius-network-could-stick-around-after-bankruptcy-restructuring-expert-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abf746e3e0a27b537570918477232c0ed155f665-1331x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although all of these concepts do fall under the umbrella that is Web3, additional features such as credential data networks also fit into the picture, which play an integral part in the progression of Web3. Back to Basics The current structure of the internet (as we know it today), often labelled as Web2, allows for user-generated content to be posted on a number of different channels. As opposed to the first version of the internet that was stagnant and limited to &apos;read only&apos;, the internet has moved to a structure which allows users to generate their own content as well as interact with it, such as one posting an image to their social profile, while other users like, comment and share the content. With technology ever changing at rapid speeds, Web3 is believed to be the next step in the transition of the web. Often dubbed as &apos;the future of the internet&apos;, Web3 is a decentralised version of the web, which integrates the likes of cryptocurrencies, NFT&apos;s, DAOs, and decentralised finance into one space.

42422758,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p7Bh,1657823241,"Circle’s Detailed Reserve Report Shows Only Cash, Short-Term Treasurys Back USDC Stablecoin","Circle Internet Financial released a detailed – though unaudited – breakdown of its reserve assets for the firm’s USD coin (USDC) that showed $42.1 billion in short-term U.S. government bonds and $13.6 billion in cash.  The asset breakdown, published in a blog post by the company Thursday, shows that as of June 30 Circle held $42.1 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds with an average maturity of 44 days, with the latest expiry date being Sept. 29. A bond is considered to be short-term when its maturity is less than three months. The document also listed the bonds’ individual identifier, the so-called CUSIP number.  Circle also held $13.6 billion in cash at U.S.-regulated financial institutions, namely at the Bank of New York Mellon, Citizens Trust Bank, Customers Bank, New York Community Bank, Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and US Bancorp, according to the document.  The $55.7 billion in assets Circle claims is slightly higher than the 55.4 billion USDC tokens in circulation. USDC is supposed to hold a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar.  “While U.S. policymakers work to enact federal regulations for stablecoins, Circle continues to increase our transparency based on new industry innovations and what USDC holders within our ecosystem would like to see,” Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Fox-Geen said in the post.  The report was not audited, per the document, but it offered a more detailed glimpse into the reserve assets backing the stablecoin, the second largest by market cap and with a circulating supply of $55 billion.  The report comes amid an ongoing credit crisis in the crypto markets, kick-started by the multibillion-dollar implosion of the Terra blockchain in May as the then-third-largest stablecoin depegged from the U.S. dollar.  Crypto firms’ finances are under increasing scrutiny, with various crypto lenders and investment firms facing liquidity problems and applying for bankruptcy protection.  While stablecoins are supposed to maintain a stable price anchored to an asset such as the dollar, several stablecoins lost their price peg in the Terra implosion aftermath, including Tron’s USDD and neutrino USD (USDN). The price peg of Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin with a $66 billion market capitalization, also wobbled for a brief period.  Since May, USDC has gained in market share at the expense of USDT. Data by crypto market data tracker CoinGecko shows that while USDT had $17 billion in redemptions, USDC grew by $7 billion as holders flocked to the perceived safer asset.

Dolev estimates Coinbase's average trading volume at roughly $1.2 billion in July, down from nearly $7 billion in November 2021. The company's market share of global trading volume dropped to just 2.9% in July, said Dolev, versus an average of 5.3% in the first quarter of 2022 and a peak of 8-9% in November 2021.  According to Dolev, Coinbase ranked 14th in average trading volume by dollars in July, down from fourth last November.  Binance continues to be the world's largest exchange by volume, posting an average of nearly $11 billion in trading in July, down from $32.9 billion in November 2021.  ""This trend is problematic for COIN,"" said Dolev, as growing exchange competition will require Coinbase to continue raising marketing spend and is likely to weigh on its fee rates. ""All this, coupled with subdued volume trends, is likely to weigh on profitability moving forward, in our view.""  Dolev continues to rate the shares at neutral and trims his price target to $42 from $45. COIN is up modestly in Thursday action at $53.96.

Divergence is known for its Ethereum smart contract ability, acting behind the scenes of projects like Brotchain, The Kiss Precise and G-Money’s Admit One collection.  Divergence co-founder Arran Schlosberg will become Proof’s vice president of engineering, and the company’s other co-founder, Angharad Thomas, will be Proof’s director of product, according to a press release.  “If you rewind a couple of months, Kevin was one of our investors,” Thomas said in an interview. “We thought, ‘Why are you building over there and we [are] building over here?’ Why don't we do it together and combine the technical R&D lab with Kevin’s incredible product vision and community building.”  Proof is bolstering its staff in preparation for the launch of its “social universe” later this summer, which the company has been teasing since the release of its Proof Collective membership NFT in April. (The cheapest price for one of the NFTs on the open market is now 83 ETH, or about $93,000).  While full details about the social universe will be revealed at the company’s keynote ""Future Proof"" conference next month, Rose teased the product as being its own line of Web3 services for the larger Proof community, not just a 3D metaverse game like Yuga Labs’ Otherside project.  “The tools we’re all using for curation and communication are not built for Web3. Discord was made for gamers, Reddit is an early Web2 product,” Rose said in an interview. “We’re trying to build something where we can interact with the rich data behind the scenes. The universe and the social tools that we're building will be in a phased approach, where we'll see these very small wins over time add up to a pretty compelling social product.”  Rose’s effort will come with no shortage of capital. The Moonbirds launch and its hefty 2.5 ETH (around $2,800) mint price garnered $200 million in sales in just its opening weekend. The collection now has a 27 ETH (around $31,000) floor price and sits near the top of weekly collection volume rankings.

Related Reading | Polygon Climbs 20% On Disney Glee - Can MATIC Sustain Gains This Month? The StarkNet is an Ethereum second layer scalability solution based on Zero Knowledge (ZK) Rollup technology. This provides decentralized applications (dApps) with &apos;unlimited&apos; scalability without compromising security, decentralization, and composability. The StarkNet Token was designed to power and incentivized the key elements on this network. The announcement claims these are StarkNet&apos;s users, operators, and developers. In that sense, the company has implemented a fee structure and token minting mechanism to prevent &apos;speculative manipulation&apos;, with &apos;largely automated&apos; processes, and a track record of efficient functionality across other blockchains. The announcement is very explicit about the important roles of Operators and Developers. Thus, these components of the StarkWare ecosystem will receive a portion of the StarkNet token. For example, smart contract developers will be rewarded with a portion of the fees paid by users for leveraging L1 and L2 smart contracts. This process will be automated, according to the design explained above.

42395204,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXdrx,1657816508,Virtual Avatar Firm Hologram Raises $6.5M Seed Round,"The metaverse is increasingly becoming a beacon for self-expression.  Virtual avatar company Hologram has raised $6.5 million in seed funding led by Polychain Capital, the company said Thursday in a press release. The round also saw participation from Nascent, Inflection, The Operating Group, Quantstamp, Neon DAO, Foothill Ventures, South Park Commons, and several angel investors including Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda.  Hologram, founded by Tong Pow and Hongzi Mao in 2021, partners with online communities to foster self-expression and digital identity in the metaverse.  Pow told CoinDesk that Hologram plans to use the funding to make new key hires such as engineers and artists. They are also looking to expand partnerships with other digital communities and individuals seeking to enter the Web3 space.  Pow, who previously worked at 0x Labs, said that Hologram’s “most compelling feature” is the ability to take on any identity in the metaverse, which can’t be done in the current Web2 world.  “We've created new identities through social media profiles, through different usernames, which we're already very familiar with. But I think the ways we can express ourselves beyond our physical identities really remained static with the examples I listed before,” said Pow.  Hologram partners with brands, online communities, and individual creators to create unique identities in the metaverse. Hologram recently partnered with Anata NFT, an Anime NFT avatar collection, and is also working with other projects such as Cool Cats, Deadfellaz and Crypto Covens.  Self-expression in the metaverse is an attractive feature for those entering the space. That’s one of the reasons why brands featured their non-fungible token (NFT) clothes for Decentraland avatars during Metaverse Fashion Week, and why NFT avatar collections have become so popular.  However, another benefit emerges from the product: improved pseudonymity.  According to Pow, Hologram is making pseudonymity in the metaverse more legitimate by protecting users’ personal information behind their digital persona ownership, which can be beneficial for “high stake use cases,” such as interviews or other public appearances.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MANA | SPONSORED | ZRX,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/14/virtual-avatar-firm-hologram-raises-65m-seed-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/384f207190853bfd132e7f9710dfc0248b2e41e6-1553x1165.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest digital token by market cap is rising 5% to $20.4K as of shortly before 12:00 p.m. ET, as it's been seesawing back and forth in a tight trading range in recent months. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is jumping 8% to $1.14K. Keep in mind, though, that both cryptos are off well over 60% from their November peaks. That begs the question of whether the current upswing in cryptos is the beginning of a much bigger rally, or if the cryptoverse is experiencing a bear market rally followed by new lows. Stocks, however, are getting knocked lower as producer prices for June came in hotter than expected (a day after consumer prices topped consensus), in addition to markets pricing in a full-point jump this month in the Federal Reserve's benchmark lending rate.

In preparation for Ethereum’s merge with the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain to complete the transition, it has been undergoing a series of test forks that copy the data from the main network to a test environment network (testnet).  Read more: How Ethereum Will Be Transformed in 2022  Unlike a full testnet Merge hard fork, like the Sepolia hard fork, a shadow fork is a smaller test fork that focuses on one or two small changes that need to happen when the Ethereum Merge eventually occurs on the main protocol. During this ninth shadow fork, developers focused primarily on testing updates and the releases used in the recent Sepolia hard fork ""but on a more intensive network,” said Parithosh, DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation.  Today’s shadow fork occurred at 00:00 UTC when Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) was overridden at 53945568722258575228928. In the hours since the shadow fork happened, no significant glitches have been reported.  The fork occurred significantly earlier than expected, however. Originally it was predicted to happen at 15:00 UTC, but instead it occurred at 00:00 UTC. This discrepancy was due to a calculator error with the developers’ estimation tool, not because of any error in the code itself.  Parithosh told CoinDesk, “There seems to have been a minor spike in hashrate that sped up things a bit. The TTD estimation tool I use is also a local tool, it caches a lot of blocks and tries to average things out, it seems to have a lot of stale state since I haven't cleared the old state.”  He added, “There were, however, no problems that were attributed to the TTD being hit earlier. All the nodes were ready except for a few syncing nodes. So this is a good sign that even when TTD is hit much earlier than expected, the network works as expected.”  Parithosh also noted that to ensure a similar situation doesn't occur on mainnet, developers would use multiple TTD estimation methods.  The shadow fork brings the project one step closer to Ethereum's mainnet upgrade later this year. The third and final testnet merge, Goerli, is expected to happen next month.

Ethereum (ETH) added 4.3% to trade at nearly $1,100 in the past 24 hours. Gains in major cryptos ranged from 15% for Polygon’s MATIC tokens to nominal movements of over 1% on XRP and Cardano’s ADA. Total crypto market capitalization rose 2.6% overnight to regain the $900 billion level.  U.S. inflation data came out stronger than expected on Wednesday, which triggered an impulsive wave of dollar appreciation and a sell-off in risky assets.  Bitcoin, however, found buyers quickly on the decline and recovered any losses from Wednesday’s move, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said.  “This is a notable moment, as crypto has often taken on the role of a leading indicator of market sentiment in recent months,” Kuptsikevich said. “Bitcoin may continue to fall but will hit another all-time high in the next 24 months, according to CoinShares. At the same time, prices are not expected to fall below $14,000.”  Some traders suggested high inflation readings were already priced in. ""bitcoin's reaction, or lack thereof, is not much different from traditional markets. It will take a bit more than that to move the needle,"" Jin Gonzalez of Oz Finance told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “Inflation is old news. We all knew it was coming,"" Gonzalez added. ""For now, bitcoin is likely to settle around $20,000, but a significant event demonstrating that the broader market is recovering is required for it to regain power. Investors will remain cautious as long as forecasts are pessimistic, so the market will not move significantly,.""  Anton Gulin, business director at crypto exchange AAX, seconded that sentiment. “By this session, it feels like inflation readings became so mainstream that they stopped impacting the markets,” he said, adding that futures tracking the S&P500 didn’t fall below the local lows even as inflation reached four-decade highs.  “Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies are trading at the same level,"" he added. ""We may expect a DXY (U.S. dollar index) correction in the coming time, which may result in short-term rallies. But all in all, it’s the same old devastating and boring accumulation phase.""  Meanwhile, Aleks Gladskikh, founder at crypto market making firm Marketmaking.pro, noted that major crypto investors remain optimistic and continuing to invest in the sector.  “The investment pace slowed down in 2022, but the record level of a blockchain-focused venture dry powder is waiting to be deployed,” Gladskikh said. “We expect the new crypto bull market to start before the end of 2022.”",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/14/crypto-traders-see-few-tailwinds-for-bitcoin-prices-despite-inflation-gauge-alarms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a5e0f34f16459f1186f4d35ee68814b13e7d7bf-3371x2528.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While improved profitability means there may be less pressure for miners to sell their bitcoin holdings for liquidity purposes, the drop in production costs could be viewed as a negative for overall bitcoin price, JPMorgan added in its note to clients.  “The decline in the production cost might be perceived as negative for the bitcoin price outlook going forward to the extent that the production cost is perceived by some market participants as the lower bound of the bitcoin’s price range in a bear market.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/14/bitcoin-production-cost-has-dropped-to-about-13k-jpmorgan-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7982f2cd16aaa896fdd1b231cf766d18f1f1cc2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Other investors in the round included Tiger Global Management, Thirty Five Ventures, Night Ventures, Warby Parker and venture firm Good Friends, among others.  The Hang platform lets brand program managers set up membership rules, add benefits and rewards and connect to third-party services.  The membership programs use non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to incentivize customers with rewards and perks.  “Between the democratization of e-commerce infrastructure making it easier than ever to create a new brand and new privacy changes from Apple and Meta, it has never been more expensive for brands to acquire customers and incentivize high-value actions,” Smolin said.  “Hang offers brands a new way to offset these acquisition costs and increase the value of their existing user base, by harnessing the unique advantages of NFT technology to transform the relationship they have with their customers and build a new one rooted in shared incentives, reciprocity and community,” he added.  Hang is already collaborating with Budweiser, Pinkberry, Bleacher Report and Superfly, the company behind the Outside Lands and Bonnaroo music festivals.

MATIC reached its highest level since early June, in the mid-$6.0 range, a day after Polygon was selected for Walt Disney&apos;s benchmark business growth program. According to a Disney release, Polygon is one of the six organizations that will participate in the company&apos;s 2022 Accelerator Program, a business and development initiative created to promote the expansion of creative businesses globally. Suggested Reading | CEL Token Price Plummets 50% As Celsius Goes Bankrupt Polygon (MATIC) Rises 20% In Last 7 Days As of this writing, MATIC is trading at $0.656, up 20.3% in the last seven days, data by Coingecko show, Thursday, its highest level in a month. In doing so, the token also surpassed its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), the sloping red resistance mark that had constrained MATIC&apos;s gains since January of this year. This week marks the launch of the Disney Accelerator program, which aims to explore new technologies inside augmented reality (AR), non-fungible tokens, and artificial intelligence (AI).

42395213,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXdzp,1657807725,"First Mover Americas: BTC Shows Resilience Despite Widespread Risk Aversion, Celsius' Bankruptcy Filing","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Bitcoin and altcoins are trading up over the last 24 hours despite widespread risk aversion and more negative news from crypto lenders.  Market Moves: A decentralized exchange says it's pushing back against that crypto-market convention – with plans to offer ""expirable"" futures contracts  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading 3% up on the day even as troubled crypto lender Celsuis is the latest to file for bankruptcy.  Celsius, which is facing a liquidity crisis, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, the lender said in a statement issued late Wednesday.  BTC was trading at around $19,820 at the time of writing, holding surprisingly well even after negative news. Ether (ETH) was also slightly down over the last 24 hours, at $1,070.  Polygon’s MATIC was up 17% over the last 24 hours, following the news that the Ethereum scaling solution will join Disney’s ‘Accelerator Program’ to develop augmented reality, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and artificial intelligence experiences.  Also rallying overnight was decentralized exchange Uniswap's UNI token, which climbed 16%.  “We’ve seen strong gains across select decentralized finance (DeFi) coins overnight, such as UNI, SYN and LDO,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack Funds.  “While the gains aren’t on huge volume, they appear to be forming a technical base at these levels, which may lay ground for further upside,” said Dibb.  Meanwhile, bankrupt crypto lending platform Voyager Digital's native coin voyager (VGX) has more than tripled in three days. According to one analyst, the move appears to be driven by a short squeeze.  Since Tuesday, VGX has increased by 257% from $0.14 to $0.50 with prices hitting a high of $1.01 in the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows.  In other news, crypto exchange OKX has followed in the footsteps of FTX and Kraken and secured a license in the UAE, according to a press release on Thursday.  A metric which measures the difference between bitcoin’s going market value and its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), the Mayer Multiple, is suggesting the $836 billion crypto market may be close to bottom.  At press time, the Mayer Multiple was 0.53, meaning the crypto market valued at $863 billion was worth almost half of its 200-day average of $1.603 trillion.  The Block reported that ""move-to-earn"" Solana-based project Stepn, which awards users for walking/jogging, announced Tuesday that it earned $122.5 million from platform fees in the second quarter of 2022, and 5% of those earnings will go toward buying and burning the project's native token, green metaverse token (GMT).

Perpetual swaps are like futures contracts without expiration dates; they can be held indefinitely without the need to roll over contracts as they reach maturity.  The decentralized exchange Contango says it's pushing back against that crypto-market convention – with plans to offer ""expirable"" contracts that more closely resemble the traditional futures traded on exchanges like CME, linked to everything from bitcoin to crude oil and pork bellies.  Contango says its offering will be the first of its kind on a decentralized exchange, or DEX. The firm said Thursday in a statement that it raised $4 million in a seed round in December, at a $45 million valuation, from an investment group led by ParaFi and including Coinbase Ventures, Spartan Group and Amber Group.  The company says its platform is undergoing security audits and that it plans to launch a beta version later in the summer.  The downside of perpetual futures is that funding rates (periodic payments that are long or short based on the difference between perpetual and spot prices) are largely unpredictable, according to Contango’s co-founder, Kamel Aouane.  Whereas with expirable futures, investors are in full control of the cost from the beginning.  “With perpetual futures, if you are on the wrong side of the market, you are bleeding money,” said Aouane, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Contango prices futures using spot and interest rates, as implied by the interest rate parity, a formula well known in traditional finance.  There are currently no other DEX’s that offer expirable futures in the crypto market, according to a report on the state of the crypto derivatives market by Jump Crypto, the cryptocurrency arm of the decades-old trading firm Jump Trading Group.  In the report, Jump Crypto wrote that the decentralized derivatives markets across both futures and options are “under-developed” compared with their centralized counterparties.

It provides a platform on which developers can build decentralized applications (dapps). The most successful layer 1 blockchain is Ethereum, so protocols like Near are seen as challengers.  The key yardsticks for layer 1 networks are transaction costs, speed and the ability to maintain those features as transaction volumes grow. These factors are the focus for layer 1s like Near to improve upon Ethereum, which has encountered issues with costs and speed over the last few years.  Near Protocol is faster and cheaper than Ethereum. More importantly, it promises to be faster than some of the other largest challengers. When fully implemented, Near is expected to be able to process up to around 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). Ethereum’s largest rival, Solana, averages less than 3,000 transactions per second, according to its own blockchain explorer. Ethereum averages double-digit transactions per second. Bitcoin does less than 10.  Outside the crypto sphere, an important comparison is Visa’s (V) capacity. The global payments giant processes around 7,000-8,000 TPS, based on its claim of 232.5 billion transactions over a 12-month period. Near Protocol could eclipse that, though it has not yet realized its theoretical potential as of July 2022.  “Near has built technology to enable transactions that are fast (~1 second), quick to finality (~1-2 seconds), cheap (less than a penny), and secure,” crypto research firm Messari noted in March 2022.  How does Near Protocol achieve those numbers?  Near Protocol’s defining feature is a technique called ""sharding,"" designed to improve transaction speed and capacity. It involves breaking up the blockchain into sub-chains with different validators working on them, which regularly get connected to one another. Effectively, the network dodges the problem of becoming too big by cutting itself up into smaller parts.  Near Protocol is starting to implement a new version of sharding, which will turn it into what it describes as a ""fully sharded"" network. The innovation is ""state sharding,"" as opposed to simply ""processing sharding."" Instead of simply dividing up the responsibilities of the validators, it actually divides the blockchain itself up into smaller parts. Near calls its technology ""Nightshade"" and began introducing it in phases in late 2021, as the transaction volume on the network increased.  Near Protocol is by no means the first network to use sharding. It has been talked about as a possible fix for Ethereum since 2013 and Ethereum-competitor Zilliqa put one version of it into practice back in 2018. But a ""fully sharded"" chain would break new ground.  This is why Near Protocol claims to offer “infinite scalability,” which means that the volume of transactions happening on the network can grow indefinitely without hurting its performance.  Near uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, in contrast with Ethereum’s current proof-of-work model (though it is working on transitioning to PoS through the Merge).  In proof-of-stake, bad actors are deterred from corrupting the system by a requirement to ""stake"" a certain volume of tokens to validate blocks. Near currently sets the number of nodes at 100 and requires a minimum threshold of 67,000 NEAR tokens in order to participate in the validation of new blocks of legitimate transactions and get rewarded with more tokens. Currently, the node with the lowest amount has over 162,000 NEAR tokens staked.  Despite its promising ideas, Near Protocol is still a long way from the biggest challenger to Ethereum. Others have been around and gathering momentum for longer: Solana, whose native token is SOL, and Polkadot, whose token is DOT, are two of the best known. The native tokens had market capitalizations of around $17.5 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, in July 2022. Near Protocol’s native token NEAR had a little under $2.4 billion, to put it in perspective.  The NEAR token is used for the staking that underpins the validation of blocks on the network. Stakers get rewarded in the form of that token, too. The token’s all-time highest price was $20.44 in January 2022.  In addition to its speed and scalability, Near Protocol taps into the conversation around the environmental impact of the crypto sector by touting its ""carbon neutrality."" It partners with carbon-offsetting companies to cancel out its energy use. Additionally, proof-of-stake mechanisms tend to be less emission-heavy than their proof-of-work counterparts.  How is the NEAR token doing in 2022?  The first few months of 2022 looked very encouraging for Near Protocol. Analysts noted rapid growth in the volume of applications developed on the network and intensifying interest from major investors. The NEAR token roughly doubled in value to more than $17 between March and April. The protocol raised $400 million in funding in just the first four months of the year.  By May 2022, the outlook had started to sour for the wider crypto space. Near made a play to capitalize on the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin by publishing an open invitation to the Terra community. It noted synergies including the fact that both networks used the same language, Rust, to write smart contracts.  But that could not protect Near from the harrowing summer that was about to hit the sector. By July, the NEAR token's value had dropped to less than $4.",POSITIVE,SOL | NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | NEAR,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-near-protocol-and-how-does-it-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/588e16b69513dd210d26592333baf9f9ce211186-4998x3749.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395220,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXe1n,1657803717,DEX Contango Pushes Retro Alternative to Perps With 'Expirable Futures',"The bitcoin perpetual swap is an innovation in crypto markets that was pioneered in 2016 by the exchange BitMEX and quickly adopted by rivals, including Binance and FTX.  Perpetual swaps are like futures contracts without expiration dates; they can be held indefinitely without the need to roll over contracts as they reach maturity.  The decentralized exchange Contango says it's pushing back against that crypto-market convention – with plans to offer ""expirable"" contracts that more closely resemble the traditional futures traded on exchanges like CME, linked to everything from bitcoin (BTC) to crude oil and pork bellies.  Contango says its offering will be the first of its kind on a decentralized exchange, or DEX. The firm said Thursday in a statement that it raised $4 million in a seed round in December, at a $45 million valuation, from an investment group led by ParaFi and including Coinbase Ventures, Spartan Group and Amber Group.  The company says its platform is undergoing security audits and that it plans to launch a beta version later in the summer.  The downside of perpetual futures is that funding rates (periodic payments that are long or short based on the difference between perpetual and spot prices) are largely unpredictable, according to Contango’s co-founder, Kamel Aouane.  Whereas with expirable futures, investors are in full control of the cost from the beginning.  “With perpetual futures, if you are on the wrong side of the market, you are bleeding money,” said Aouane, in an interview with CoinDesk.  Contango prices futures using spot and interest rates, as implied by the interest rate parity, a formula well known in traditional finance.  There are currently no other DEX’s that offer expirable futures in the crypto market, according to a report on the state of the crypto derivatives market by Jump Crypto, the cryptocurrency arm of the decades-old trading firm Jump Trading Group.  In the report, Jump Crypto wrote that the decentralized derivatives markets across both futures and options are “under-developed” compared with their centralized counterparties.  Market concentration in the derivatives space is primarily focused on centralized or ""CeFi"" exchanges such as Kraken, FTX and Binance – which all offer expiring and perpetual futures.  Contango says that, by taking advantage of liquidity pools of underlying fixed-rate markets, it's able to offer the same order of magnitude of liquidity and price impact as major centralized exchanges.  How does it work?  Contango is going to offer expirable futures without order books or liquidity pools. When a trader opens a position, the protocol borrows on the fixed-rate market, swaps on the spot market, then lends back on the fixed-rate market.  By taking advantage of liquidity pools of underlying fixed-rate markets, Contango is able to offer the same order of magnitude of liquidity and price impact as major centralized exchanges.  For crypto traders, there might be arbitrage opportunities between Contango's platform and major exchanges like Binance, Aouane said.  “It will be interesting to observe the evolution of the derivative space and Contango’s contribution to price alignment between CeFi and DeFi,” said Aouane.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/14/dex-contango-pushes-retro-alternative-to-perps-with-expirable-futures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89e4b518d02edc14f05e23e5067e30e82e673fb5-600x439.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421492,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUvN,1657803000,6 Ways Advisors Can Help Crypto Investors Avoid Large Losses,"At the onset of a crypto winter, financial advisors can keep their clients engaged with bitcoin (BTC) but help them remain safe at the same time.  That winter is now upon us and a flurry of failures, bankruptcies and collapses has already occurred – with possibly more to follow.  I think these issues come in two different varieties – yetis and avalanches. Yetis are the bad actors who could steal crypto assets or who design projects in a haphazard manner. Avalanches are the collapses that leave the end investor holding the bag.  Look no further than the avalanche last week caused by the failure of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital: Voyager Digital declared bankruptcy, leaving clients of the exchange potentially unable to recoup any investments stored there.  Read More: Voyager Seeks Bankruptcy Protection Amid Crypto Credit Crisis  As advisors, the goal is not just to keep clients calm throughout price volatility of cryptocurrency tokens and related funds. The goal is to avoid the potential disaster of moving client assets into a doomed decentralized finance project or hedge fund or advising them to use an exchange or crypto broker that is borderline insolvent.  So how can we avoid all the dumb mistakes that leave us vulnerable in the midst of a crypto winter? There are a variety of ways.  Understand funding and backing  For digital asset exchanges, adequate funding means that there’s enough in the pot to handle liquidations. In the world of decentralized finance, it is the network of participants who help keep projects afloat. In the recently treacherous realm of stablecoins, it’s the collateral backing the project.  Know the developers and founders  The early blockchain and crypto industry was a haven for anonymity. We still don’t know who is Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of the Bitcoin blockchain. But after 13 years of growth and evolution, investors shouldn’t be kept in the dark about who is creating tokens and protocols. Projects with identifiable founders, developers and leaders are less likely to end up as money-losing schemes.  Read white papers  Not only are founders, developers and leaders mostly no longer anonymous, they are also in regular contact with the communities of investor-participants they are creating. In most digital asset projects, this communication starts with a whitepaper that explains what the project is intended to do.  This isn’t as cut and dry as it should be. Some projects founded without much rationale to begin with – like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu – have taken on a life of their own. Meanwhile, others with very clear and well-communicated rationales have failed – like Terra. By and large, reading these white papers will aid our discretion.  Apply common sense  Consider the old investment adage,“ If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.” This holds true in the crypto universe as well.  The problem is that many new entrants into the crypto space set overly high expectations. They compare themselves to early entrants into bitcoin and ether (ETH), who reaped returns in the thousands of percent.  The reality is that the speculative days of digital assets are quickly coming to a close, and the opportunities for huge returns over short time periods have become fewer and further between.  Take yields for example. As more people participate in decentralized finance (DeFi), the yields and income being offered by such projects should also come back down to Earth. If something purports to offer a yield of over 10% annually there had better be a good reason why it is able to do so, and that reason should be found in the documentation sent by the project’s leaders and developers.  Read More: Despite Recent Bumps in the Road, Stablecoins Will Stick Around  Clients of advisors may see the pie in the sky and seek out opportunities for huge returns and high yields, but advisors have to assess if the returns and yields are sustainable.  Consider cold storage  Recall the difference between hot and cold storage. Hot storage occurs in active wallets, on crypto exchanges or with crypto brokers. Cold storage, on the other hand, is held in offline devices by the owner/investor of the crypto. Cold storage is the most secure way to hold cryptocurrencies.  If an advisor or investor has legitimate concerns their crypto broker of choice might suffer from liquidity issues or bankruptcy, a move to cold storage may be the best way to keep assets safe.  Pay attention to regulators  If managing volatility and helping clients avoid bad projects is too much work, regulators are almost certain to step forward to respond to some of the struggles in the crypto space.

Last month, the crypto firm suspended withdrawals after an individual's account went into negative equity during the market crash, affecting the exchange's balances.  “We will be making 10% of user balances available for withdrawal with the exception of flexUSD, which cannot be withdrawn until further notice,” CoinFlex’s co-founders Sudhu Arumugam and Mark Lamb said in a blog post on Thursday. The remaining 90% of user funds will remain locked in customer accounts.  CoinFLEX recently began arbitration in an attempt to recover $84 million in debt owed by a “large individual customer” as part of a broader revival strategy. The individual was revealed to be prominent crypto investor Roger Ver, a claim that Ver denied on social media.  The firm said it holds more than 26 million FLEX tokens – valued at over $7 million at current prices – in its inventory. It added that resuming trades would cause market volatility in FLEX's price, which would inadvertently affect the collateral positions of platform users.  “We are continuing to work on all avenues to resolve this situation. This ranges from possible further withdrawals and potential new equity investors to the acquisition of CoinFLEX and combinations in between. We continue to work closely with the significant creditor group,” the firm's co-founders added in the blog. The company expects to provide an additional update by July 22.

42395218,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXe0o,1657800815,"The $863B Crypto Market May Be Close to Bottom, Mayer Multiple Suggests","The Mayer Multiple, which measures the difference between an asset's going market value and its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), suggests the crypto bear market has run its course.  At press time, the Mayer Multiple was 0.53, meaning the crypto market valued at $863 billion was worth almost half of its 200-day average of $1.603 trillion.  The metric fell below 0.5 last month, with the market value hitting a low of $762.8 billion.  The previous crypto bear markets ended with the Mayer Multiple falling below 0.5. If history is a guide, the market may have found a bottom at the June low of $762.8 billion.  Developed by bitcoin investor and podcast host Trace Mayer, the Mayer Multiple helps investors identify oversold and overbought conditions by comparing the market value to the 200-day SMA.  The assumption is that the market would bounce back or pull back to its mean, represented by the 200-day SMA, after extended downtrends or uptrends. In the past, 0.5 or below readings have marked bottoms. In contrast, readings above 2.4 have signaled the final stages of the bull market characterized by retail investor frenzy.  The 200-day SMA is one of the most widely tracked gauges of long-term trends. As per technical analysis theory, an asset is said to be in a bear market once its value drops under the 200-day SMA and vice versa.  ""When prices trade below the 200DMA, it is often considered a bear market,” blockchain analytics firm Glassnode's report dated June 24 said. “When prices trade above the 200DMA, it is often considered a bull market.”  The Mayer Multiple is not the only indicator signaling an end of the bear market. Recently, on-chain indicators, such as the Puell Multiple and the MVRV Z-score, and a long-term moving average crossover have flashed similar signals.  However, past performance is no guarantee of future results, more so, as bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has evolved into a risk-on asset since the crash of March 2020. Therefore, the entire crypto market is more sensitive to factors like the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and inflation than it was during the prior bear markets.  The U.S. reported inflation at a new four-decade high of 9.1% on Wednesday, spurring bets of a 100 basis point rate hike later this month. The crypto market valuation has declined by 70% since November, predominantly on fears of faster liquidity withdrawal by the Fed.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/14/the-863b-crypto-market-may-be-close-to-bottom-technical-indicator-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/945cd0128047693b0200da8f997b03fcd25f4692-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The platform is now able to show information such as balances, transactions and the type of crypto assets held from the three exchanges, the San Francisco-based firm said Thursday.  Plaid already offers crypto holdings information for apps like Robinhood and SoFi, and it plans to connect to other crypto account providers, with Blockchain.com and BitGo being integrated later this year.  “Up until now, a lot of people have had separate crypto and traditional finance lives,” Alain Meier, Plaid’s head of identity, said in an interview. “We want to help consumers create a holistic view of their finances, so this move is especially important given that something like 60% of millennials now own crypto.”  The platform is useful for financial planning, tax assessment and net worth calculations, Meier said, as it includes balances from investment accounts, ranging from brokerage and retirement accounts, to 529s (a type of tax-advantaged saving plan for college fees) and U.S. health savings accounts (HSAs).  Firms like Plaid have been part of an explosion in fintech apps as banks gradually opened up to digital innovation. Crypto exchanges, like banks, are nervous about what happens to their customer information, given the continual threat of sophisticated hack attacks.  “This is a read-only feed of transactions to be included in things like wealth-management apps or transfer apps,” Meier said. “There’s no potential access for these apps to then go ahead and steal your crypto or anything. We also have robust due diligence and risk management policies for all of the customers who we bring onto the Plaid network.”  Plaid already works with a number of exchanges, including Coinbase, through its identity verification and bank-linked account funding services. The fintech had also shown a keen interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), back in 2020’s “DeFi summer.” An API, or application programming interface, is a way for two programs to interact and share data.  “Plaid is composed of a lot of people who are just nuts about crypto,” Meier said. “Over time, we want to help bridge that gap between Web2 and Web3 and build developer-first tooling products that can do that.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/14/plaid-adds-crypto-account-data-from-binanceus-kraken-gemini-to-open-banking-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b10e17389a916594e54321a1c6d5bcc7f9348827-1339x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395214,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXdxr,1657793513,"Digital Euro Would Be a Success Only if Widely Used, ECB Says","Only a digital euro that is widely accepted by European users could be considered a success, according to the European Central Bank (ECB).  The ECB published key objectives for the digital euro in a blog post authored by the bank's President Christine Lagarde and executive board member Fabio Panetta on Wednesday. An accompanying document laid out some basic design considerations for a digital version of the European Union's single currency meant for public use.  ""The digital euro can only be successful if it becomes part of the everyday lives of Europeans. It must add value compared with existing solutions,"" the post said.  In the post, the two said it's too early to settle details of the design, but the bank expects to wrap up the investigation phase of the project in the autumn of 2023.  The ECB initiated the digital euro project in June 2021 and kicked off a two-year investigation phase into a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) in October. Since then, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm responsible for proposing new legislation, said it will introduce a digital euro bill in 2023.  Meanwhile, the ECB has been largely reticent about the details and findings of its experiment, apart from sporadic hints about a digital euro possibly launching within the next four years, and how the ECB would likely move to limit the amount in circulation to 1.5 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion) to control the negative effects it might have on financial stability.  Lagarde and Panetta also said the digital euro is intended as a means of payment, not a form of investment.  ""Otherwise too many commercial bank deposits could be moved to the central bank – a scenario which would make it more difficult for banks to lend to consumers and companies, and which could even generate tensions in the banking system during times of financial stress,"" the post said.  Although it's too early to specify the design elements of a digital euro, some objectives are clear, the report said.  ""First, a digital euro must respond to the needs of its users,"" the officials said, adding that according to research, users value wide acceptance, ease of use, low costs, high speed, security and consumer protection the most.  A digital euro should also benefit people who currently have limited access to digital payments, the report said.  The officials also presented the case for a digital euro.  ""Introducing a digital euro would ensure that citizens can continue to trust in the monetary anchor behind their digital payments.

42395207,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXdtv,1657789143,Voyager Digital's Token Surges Over 250% on 'Short Squeeze',"Bankrupt cryptocurrency lending platform Voyager Digital's native coin voyager (VGX) has more than tripled in three days. According to one observer, the move appears to be driven by a short squeeze.  Since Tuesday, VGX has increased by 257% from $0.14 to $0.50 with prices hitting a high of $1.01 in the past 24 hours, CoinDesk data shows.  ""Pumping coins of insolvent businesses seem to be becoming a meta,"" CK Cheung, investment analyst at Defiance Capital, said. ""Similar pumps happened to Terra's LUNC token and Celsius' CEL token, mostly because of a short squeeze.""  A short squeeze refers to a sharp rally fueled by the unwinding of bearish positions or sellers rushing to take profits. Assets like VGX, that are in a prolonged downtrend marked by extremely bearish investor sentiment, are typically prone to a short squeezes. When an asset is heavily shorted, a minor price bump often has several sellers throw in the towel and square off their sell trades. This, in turn, puts upward pressure on prices, leading to an exaggerated move. The catalyst for an initial move higher can be fundamental news or a prominent trader taking profit on the short position.  VGX hit a record low of $0.14 early this week, registering a 97% decline from the November peak of $5.81. Broader market downturn and concerns about the solvency of crypto companies, particularly lenders, roiled the VGX token in the year's first half. The market fears came true earlier this month, with the Toronto-based lender filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 6, citing the default of the now-insolvent hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).  On the same day Voyager Digital, whose 60% of the loan book was reportedly composed of loans to 3AC, proposed a restructuring plan, perhaps providing a trigger for the short squeeze.  According to the plan, customers will receive a pro-rata share of four different assets – funds recovered from 3AC, existing VGX tokens, shares in the reorganized firm and other cryptocurrencies.  On Monday, Voyager's CEO Steve Ehrlich clarified that the proposed reorganization is subject to change and the exact amount that the customers will receive would “depend on what happens in the restructuring process and the recovery of 3AC assets.” According to CNBC, a federal judge in the New York bankruptcy court has frozen 3AC's assets.  Further, a VGX pump scheme announced on Twitter by an unknown firm called MetaForm Labs may have powered the rally in the battered cryptocurrency.  Under the ""PumpVGXJuly18"" plan, MetaForm Labs is targeting a price level of $5, which amounts to an eight-fold rally from the current price of $0.6. That's an ambitious goal considering Voyager's problems. Besides, crypto pump schemes have a bad reputation for being exit strategies for whales and scammers and trapping retail investors on the wrong side of the market.",NEUTRAL,LUNC,BUSINESS | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/14/voyager-digitals-token-surges-over-250-on-short-squeeze,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e74ed741cc8cabc0553df55f28dbee7c13df348e-1810x860.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

UK Court Allows Lawsuit to be Airdropped According to court documents, a judge in the United Kingdom has given the approval for legal documents to be served over a blockchain via a non-fungible token (NFT). The ruling comes from a case brought by Fabrizio D&apos;Aloia, the founder of an online gambling company against cryptocurrency exchanges and other platforms including Binance. D&apos;Aloia claimed to have been lured by an online brokerage into depositing about 2.1 million USDT and 230,000 USDC into two wallets that turned out to be fraudulent. The court ruled that the exchanges were thus responsible for ensuring that stolen crypto was not moved or taken out of their systems. Binance, Poloniex, Gate.io, OKX, and Bitkub have been identified by D&apos;Aloia as holding his crypto.

""The Internet and Mobile Association of India has stated that it is dissolving the Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council, which the association created and nurtured for four years. The association was forced to take the decision in light of the fact that a resolution of the regulatory environment for the industry is still very uncertain and that the association would like to utilize its limited resources for other emerging digital sectors, which make a more immediate and direct contribution to digital India, notably, deepening financial inclusion and promoting a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC),” the statement said.  A source cited a lack of maturity among crypto founders when dealing with the government and inaction around critical matters despite prompting by India's parliamentary finance body. The IAMAI felt it was risking its reputation and credibility earned over years of working with new industries and it was time the crypto industry recognized it needed to change its approach, a person familiar with the matter said.  The move is another blow to India's crypto industry, which has been hit by stiff taxes, payment processors cutting off exchanges, trading volumes crashing and a global bear market.  ""It is unfortunate that this has happened when things have become difficult,"" an industry source said.  The move was announced as a ""collective decision"" in a video conference call with industry stakeholders and representatives of crypto exchanges.  ""We were told that the IAMAI has distanced itself from advocacy for crypto exchanges,"" one of the people familiar with the call said. As for what the decision meant for the industry, ""We did not get a straight answer,"" the person said.  Differences had emerged within the IAMAI and some members of the BACC on how to react to the new taxes on crypto trading. Some industry participants felt a legal challenge was the best way forward, a view the IAMAI didn't support.

42374267,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvYqiz,1657773434,Celsius' Mining Unit Files for Bankruptcy Just Months After Announcing IPO Intention,"Celsius Network's mining unit, which said in March it planned to go public, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, along with its parent company, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  The mining unit of the troubled lender said in March it had filed a confidential S-1 draft registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to take the company public. At the time shares of most publicly traded crypto mining companies were tumbling, with the broader market selloff.  Fast forward to summer, with the continued bear market, miners were forced to sell their mined bitcoins to pay for their operating costs and some industry participants expected lot of miners to turn to M&A to survive the down turn as some faced debt crisis. Celsius Mining's bankruptcy filing is likely to be another blow to investor sentiment in the mining sector.  Celsius Mining's IPO process wasn't a successful option as investors couldn't get past the possibility of litigation risk while the parent company paused customer withdrawals and faced bankruptcy, according to a person familiar with the mining unit's IPO process.  The unit also faced similar investor sentiment while seeking potential ""rescue financing"" which would bail out the miner, if the IPO fell apart, according to the person, who didn't want to be identified.  Celsius Mining has been active in the industry via investing and lending as well as helping host the miners to which it lends. In March, bitcoin (BTC) miner Mawson (MIGI) signed a 100-megawatt co-location and $20 million debt deal with Celsius Mining.  Last year Celsius Mining said it invested a total of $500 million for its bitcoin mining operations in North America.

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies postponed voting on a crypto bill until after the presidential elections in October, sources close to the matter told CoinDesk.  Deputies were going to consider the crypto bill before the congressional recess, starting next week, but the treatment of a budget guidelines law and a proposed constitutional reform for the medical sector have dominated the legislative agenda.  In April, the Senate approved the bill, which regulates crypto transactions and creates the label ""virtual service providers"" for crypto companies.  The Chamber of Deputies, for its part, has not reached a consensus on a final text as Congressman Expedito Netto (PSD-RO), in charge of presenting the bill in the lower house, removed two articles from the Senate’s original bill. The first removed article required exchanges to keep their assets separate from those of customers, while the second demanded exchanges to already have an EIN in Brazil in order to apply for a license.  ABCripto, the association that gathers local exchanges, asked the Chamber of Deputies to preserve those two original articles; meanwhile, foreign companies such as Binance and Bitso welcomed Netto’s proposed changes.  The first round of Brazil's presidential elections will take place Oct. 2, in which former President Lula da Silva is the frontrunner, according to the latest polls. A run-off would take place on Oct. 30.  This article was translated by Andrés Engler and edited by CoinDesk.

The expectation going into Wednesday was that a high U.S. inflation reading for June would push the Federal Reserve to get more aggressive in tightening monetary conditions to slow the consumer-price increases – and that in turn would put negative pressure on prices for risky assets, from stocks to bitcoin.  U.S. stocks ended the session lower, so bitcoin's rise prompted some head-scratching from crypto analysts.  ""Normally, this is bad news for the economy and the markets,"" wrote Alexandre Lores, director of blockchain markets research at Quantum Economics, wrote in a newsletter. ""Whether it's just another piece of bad economic data thrown onto the pile, or whether this was already priced in, so far investors are meh about it.""  In digital asset markets, Polygon's MATIC token was up 11% after Polygon was selected as one of six companies to join Disney's Accelerator program.  And crypto analysts were gawking at an obscure market metric known as the ""stETH discount"" – possibly a sign troubled crypto lender Celsius Network might be getting ready to dump some or all of its $435 million stash of staked ether (stETH) tokens. Krisztian Sandor had that story, as well as another exclusive based on blockchain data showing Celsius paying off its final installment of loans to decentralized finance protocols – in this case a $50 million loan to Compound.  (Just before press time, CNBC reported that Celsius's lawyers were notifying state regulators that it had started Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Celsius didn't immediately respond to an email from CoinDesk requesting comment.)  Today's First Mover Asia was edited by Bradley Keoun and produced by Greg Ahlstrand.

Companies flush with cash, such as crypto exchange FTX, are using their resources to capitalize on distressed assets in times of turmoil. The exchange’s U.S. counterpart, FTX US, recently gained an option to buy embattled crypto company BlockFi for up to $240 million, after offering a $400 million line of credit.  Separately, blockchain protocol company Ripple said in May that it was prepared to use its “strong balance sheet” to purchase the companies behind popular crypto protocols and products.  The sentiment follows a record year for mergers and acquisition activity in 2021. According to a PwC report, such deals accounted for transactions totaling more than $55 billion, much more than the $1.1 billion recorded in 2020.  Average deal sizes in the space last year also tripled to $179.7 million in 2021 from $52.7 million in 2020, the PwC report found.  In crisis, opportunity  Some analysts say the increasing interest in purchasing existing crypto players comes from the “size is important” mentality of founders.  “Companies that already dominate segments of their market and who think that size is important will use the opportunities to buy smaller competitors to absorb their customers,” said Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at crypto bank Uphold, in an email with CoinDesk.  “Financial institutions with money at their disposal have always used times of crisis to strengthen their position. This is nothing new, and certainly not a feature special to crypto. Just like in banking, few banks in any country dominate the market,” Hiesboeck added.  That does not, however, mean that smaller operators with innovative or disruptive business models don't have room to grow, Hiesboeck said.  Meanwhile, Hiesboeck said a number of smaller crypto players might be facing turbulence in the current market conditions. “Data leads us to believe that around eight smaller exchanges/wallets are currently struggling, however it's still unclear across the market how this will play out,” he said, without divulging specifics.  “The changing regulatory environment, in particular in the European Union, will force exchanges, and lenders in particular, to disclose more information about their holdings and liabilities, and therefore allow us to have a clear picture of who may be buying and who may be bought,” Hiesboeck said.
