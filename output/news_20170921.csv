Writing for CNBC, Bart Chilton – who served as a commissioner for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) from 2007 to 2014 – wrote today that big fluctuations in the price are worrisome. Earlier this month, bitcoin shot above the $5,000 mark, subsequently tumbling amidst a spate of bad news developments. At press time, the price of bitcoin is trading at around $3,651, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The jumps in price, in particular, should serve as a warning to users that bitcoin's price may being artificially inflated, Chilton argued.  He wrote in the piece:  ""There's no questions – zero – that had digital currencies been regulated, I would have sought an investigation into the precipitous price changes we've witnessed.""  Chilton ultimately concluded that, in his view, ""money will be digitized"" and cryptocurrency will be part of that process. At the same time, he called for advocates for the tech to proactively work with regulators – before they go ahead and make their move first.  ""Rather than waiting for governments to take actions that thwart the development of digital currencies, [digital enthusiasts] should lead efforts to put in place appropriate regulatory oversight for these new and innovative financial technologies,"" he wrote.  His op-ed comes more than a year after Chilton, who worked in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, called on then-President Barack Obama to launch some sort of regulatory framework to oversee cryptocurrencies.

As CoinDesk previously reported, the Nebraska Lawyers' Advisory Committee was asked if lawyers could accept bitcoin from either a client directly or through a third party. That request also queried whether lawyers can hold cryptocurrencies in escrow or in a trust on behalf of a client.  The eight-member body, appointed by the state's Supreme Court, largely gave its approval, saying that any cryptocurrencies accepted must be immediately converted into US dollars. Among the notable elements of that ruling – a first – was the call for the use of multi-signature wallets when holding funds in escrow.  Now, Matt McKeever, the attorney who submitted the request, said that his firm Copple, Rockey, McKeever & Schlecht is putting together an official policy for accepting cryptocurrencies as payment. At this time, it's not clear when the practice will officially begin taking cryptocurrencies.  Even still, McKeever struck a bullish tone in statements to the press. According to his LinkedIn account, McKeever works with clients on issues related to cryptocurrency regulation and compliance.  ""Accepting bitcoin will be our way of supporting the growing 'Silicon Prairie' in Nebraska,"" he told the Lincoln Journal-Star.

42400441,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJc2s,1506017426,Zcash Audit Finds No Serious Issues in Launch Ceremony Security,"In preparation for the launch of the privacy-centric cryptocurrency, zcash, the project's developers performed an elaborate ceremony.  No small feat, the proceedings would determine not only the viability and security of the entire network, but require the coordination of six participants in six locations around the world – all of whom needed to be in direct contact to ensure a successful outcome.  On the chat list, however, one name stood out: ""Moses.""  When the ceremony wrapped, it was revealed the owner of this pseudonym was, in fact, Derek Hinch. A consultant in Austin with the security firm NCC, Hinch had been hired to both perform the ceremony as intended and to attack it with everything he had.  Today, NCC finally published a report on Hinch's efforts – and his results may be encouraging to zcash users who harbored suspicions about the birth of the cryptocurrency, now the eighteenth-largest in the world by market value.  Most notably, Hinch reports having only minimal success with an attack on the memory of the test computer under his control, an altered replica of the one actually used for the ceremony. And he is confident that the same attack could not have been performed on the computer that was actually holding sensitive information on the day of the ceremony.  In short, according to Hinch, the ceremony was a success:  ""As far as insuring that the toxic waste shards were securely generated and then disposed of properly, which was the crux of the ceremony, I can say with certainty that happened on our end.""  Failed attacks  Stepping back, ""toxic waste"" is a term that the zcash developers coined to refer to the six shards of the single private key that had to be combined and baked into the cryptocurrency's protocol.  If someone were to get their hands on a complete copy of all the shards, it would enable them to surreptitiously create counterfeit coins, an attack that would be difficult to detect given the anonymity of zcash transactions. So, to secure the final product, the full private key was broken up into six pieces, each generated in a different location. They were then combined through a series of computations, none of which required the presentation of the key shards, which remained on isolated computers with no network capability.  At his station, Hinch had two computer setups: one harbored the actual private key shard used in the ceremony, while the other followed all the same instructions but was used to try out a series of attacks. Zcash gave Hinch root access to the machine as well as passwords that enabled him to disable some of the security protections in a layer of the software called grsec.  Even with these credentials, though, Hinch's attacks were thwarted and he failed to remotely grab the toxic waste on the computer.  But Hinch did have slightly more success with a physical attack against the memory.  Through a firewire card inserted into the test machine before the start of the ceremony, he was able to extract 2.2 gigabytes of the total 8GB on the machine, none of which contained the private key shard.  Further, Hinch says the same attack could not have been carried out against the computer he was actually using in the ceremony. To pull it off, someone would have to physically alter the computer, which was in a secure location under constant video observation.  NCC reviewed security footage of the ceremony and verified that no break-ins took place.  ""That computer was as secure as you're gonna get,"" says Hinch.  Trying again  Nevertheless, Hinch had recommendations if a similar ceremony is conducted in the future.  For starters, he believes it would be best to create a complete inventory of the contents of each computer on which toxic waste is stored to make sure there are no physical routes to the memory, such as the firewire card provided.  The zcash key generation ceremony was designed to be secure so long as a single station successfully generated and disposed of its secret before an attacker could steal it. Other participants have since shared their methods for securing their stations.  In a blog responding to the NCC report, zcash developers point out that, while it remains impossible to prove the process was secure, the analysis provides a strong indication that the ceremony went smoothly and that the fundamental security of the coinbase is intact.  Still, as this can't be known for certain, these results are simply best read as providing added assurances against compromise.

42400447,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJc7n,1506014134,Gold Investor John Hathaway: Cryptocurrencies Are 'Garbage',"A notable asset manager who focuses primarily on gold had a harsh word for the cryptocurrency market craze this week: ""garbage.""  Speaking with Kitco.com, a precious metals news and data site, John Hathaway of Tocqueville Asset Management became the latest observer to brand the cryptocurrency market ""a bubble."" Others, including Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and fellow gold investor Peter Schiff, have also issued similar warnings.  For Hathaway, the question of whether the market is in bubble territory is a no-brainer, calling the current state of affairs ""garbage"" at the outset of the interview.  ""It's an absolute bubble – there's no question in my mind that it's in a bubble,"" he told the site. As might be expected, he went on to compare the market's overall market capitalization – $126 billion at press time, according to CoinMarketCap – with the gold market.  Hathaway argued:  ""Sure you can make money in bubbles any time but you have to get out. Let's not forget that the total market value of these cryptocurrencies is $180 billion or so, maybe a little less now -that's tiny compared to gold.""  He also took aim at the argument that gold markets are seeing less attention from investors because of cryptocurrencies, declaring the idea ""baloney.""  ""It's just not true,"" he added.

42400443,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJc4q,1506010538,Y Combinator President Calls ICOs A 'Bubble' – But His Firm Might Use Blockchain,"Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator, is looking at blockchain as a possible way to boost access for investors.  Sam Altman, who serves as president of the accelerator, highlighted the plan during this week's TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco. While the strategy appears to be in the early stages, the initiative nonetheless reveals how the tech is influencing the notable accelerator, which has previously played home to startups like Coinbase.  ""We are interested in how companies like Y Combinator can use the blockchain to democratize access to investing,"" Altman said during the event, adding  ""We should try to figure that out.""  As for the state of progress on that front, TechCrunch reports that Y Combinator is currently working through the legal and logistical challenges for integrating blockchain. Whether it turns into an option to contribute cryptocurrencies or something involving initial coin offerings (ICOs) remains to be seen.  Altman returned to the topic of ""democratizing"" the investment process, positioning it from the perspective of unequal access to new wealth creation. The Y Combinator president said he was disturbed by wealth inequality in Silicon Valley – and suggested that there are technology options that exist today that could offer a solution.  ""If there’s a way that new technology can make it practical and possible to democratize this, I think that’d be great,"" he said.  During the event, Altman spoke more broadly about the ICO funding model, stating his belief that the overall market is ""definitely a bubble right now"" – yet went on to say that ""there is something underlying them, which is why smart people are fascinated."" He went on to advocate for closer oversight of the space.  ""ICOs need to be regulated,"" he said.

42400448,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJcAk,1506006015,Germany's Central Bank: Consumers Won't Use Blockchain for Payments,"Germany's central bank has published a new research paper centered on distributed ledger tech (DLT), exploring its use for payments, securities settlement and more.  Researchers from the Deutsche Bundesbank wrote in the paper that the tech ""offers a number of benefits on account of the distributed storage of data"" – highlighting both the potential opportunities as well as some of the practical challenges any application might create.  In an English-language explainer published alongside the paper (the original version is in German only), the German central bank noted that it doesn't see much of a role for the tech in consumer payments, arguing:  ""The Bundesbank’s experts see little prospect of DLT being put to widespread use in the field of individual and retail payments given the current state of the art. Particularly for payments within the euro area, they argue, the systems in operation have already been optimised for fast transfers and require a minimum of reconciliation, besides being able to process millions of transactions with ease every day.""  That said, the Bundesbank's researchers went on to say that they see a potentially wider role in instances in which users have to send their funds through multiple intermediaries.  ""International payments are very frequently settled via correspondent banking networks – where one bank has a business relationship with another credit institution operating inside the currency area with which it intends to settle payments,"" the researchers wrote. ""For payments like this, DLT could streamline a number of process steps and offer faster and cheaper settlement for end users.""  The central bank strikes a more cautious note about applications in the area of securities settlement. This is notable, given that the Bundesbank had previously undertaken a blockchain-based securities trading trial with exchange operator Deutsche Börse.  According to the central bank, it is ""still unclear whether DLT also has the edge over today’s technology in terms of security, efficiency, costs and speed.""

42400456,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJcJb,1506002422,Weak Demand? Bitcoin's Price Rebound May Be Starting to Fade,"The rebound in the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate appears to be stalling out.  After rising from a recent low of $2,980 earlier this week, bitcoin is again trading below $4,000, a development that raises doubts as to whether the rally will continue. As per CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency was trading at $3,850 at press time – down 1.68 percent in the last 24 hours.  Week-on-week, BTC is up 19 percent. On a monthly basis, BTC is down 3.7 percent.  However, assumptions that China's crypto trading crackdown will not have a long-term impact seem to have waned. This is evident from the price action analysis, which points to bullish exhaustion around $4,000 and a lack of substance in the rally from $2,980.  This runs counter to the response to a knee-jerk sell-off in bitcoin earlier this week, when, following China's crackdown on cryptocurrency trading, the market quickly saw steep gains.  Building on that momentum, on September 15, bitcoin staged a solid rebound from the 100-day moving average levels in the wake of an oversold relative strength index.  But while a similar price action in July had yielded a record rally to $5,000 levels, September may be unlikely to offer a case of history repeated.  ATR signals lack of buying pressure  Daily Chart  The chart reveals a descending broadening wedge formation – a megaphone-shaped pattern with lower peaks and lower valleys. The breakout direction is upward more than 70 percent of the time.  However, in the bitcoin's case, the odds of an upside breakout look weak, if the lack of buying pressure/lack of substance as shown by the average true range (ATR) indicator is taken into account.  ATR is a volatility indicator that reveals the degree of interest or disinterest in a move. A bullish reversal with an increase in ATR shows strong buying pressure/high interest and adds credence to the reversal.  Bitcoin's reversal from $2,908 has been accompanied by a drop in the ATR, however, which indicates lack of enthusiasm in the move.  View  ATR shows bitcoin's recovery from the low of $2,908 was the result of the unwinding of the shorts.  Lack of strong buying pressure and a failure to hold above the 50-day moving average indicates the cryptocurrency is likely to leave a lower high around $4,000 and drop to the 100-day moving average level of $3,252.  Only an upside break of the descending broadening wedge pattern would boost the odds of bitcoin rallying to record high above $5,000.

A network of P2P personal cloud servers that conceives of itself as ""virtual real estate,"" Urbit has always borne a certain kinship to blockchain technology, but never deployed a blockchain as part of its infrastructure.  However, the test version of Urbit, which has been online for about a year, will now be upgraded to use ethereum's smart contracts.  According to a blog post from the company, the smart contracts will be based on ERC20, the formal standard for ethereum tokens, to allow Urbit property owners to cryptographically secure their holdings.  According to the post, which uses the project's standard space-themed terminology:  ""We'll instantiate a land registry for Urbit address space; an ERC20 ""spark"" token which is burned to create a generic star; and a voting system for self-governance. We'll also create template contracts which galaxies can use to auction stars, and stars to distribute planets.""  Going forward, all payments will now occur on the blockchain. Urbit will further create its own web browser forked from ethereum's code.  By using smart contracts to formalise relationships on the network, Urbit said it can outsource its security measures to the ethereum platform.  However, the decision to integrate ethereum did not come without some doubts. Developers Curtis Yarvin and Galen Wolfe-Pauly state that due to their ""bottom-up"" approach to development, ""depending on Ethereum goes against all Urbit's instincts.""  Detailing this hesitancy further, the developers argued:  ""Ethereum's user experience is notorious; its governance is suspect and unstable; its dilution rate is unconscionable; its dev environment is full of bugs and misfeatures; in short, it's a classic MVP. It has only one real goal: success. It seems to be doing pretty well with that.""  In spite of this, the move is going ahead and Urbit is also expected to launch an ethereum-based token sale of its ""galaxy"" soon.

42400452,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJcDh,1505995207,Blockchain History? IBM Ventures Is Close to Making Its First Industry Investment,"The venture arm of one of the most recognizable names in the tech industry hasn't yet put its money where its mouth is on blockchain – but that may be about to change.  While global tech giant IBM has so far focused mostly on investing employee time and energy into the emerging technology, it's only just now gearing up to take an equity stake in an industry startup. In what will no doubt be taken as a sign of the blockchain industry's maturity, for IBM Ventures, investing cash is finally becoming more attractive.  And with several hurdles removed from the investment firm's strategy – including, most notably, the need for the rounds to be Series B or higher – IBM Ventures has got its eyes on candidates.  Christoph Auer-Welsbach, a partner at the firm, told CoinDesk:  ""From a time perspective, the time already is right.""  Auer-Welsbach went on to shine a light on who the companies may be, hinting that the blockchain startups he's been watching are in the supply chain management and compliance verticals.  Investing in blockchain  In short, a cash investment in a blockchain company is square in IBM Venture's sights, but there are several conditions that now need to be met. For starters, IBM's investments are expected to occur within 18 months to five years of the company's maturity – the widespread adoption of its product – and further, investments are limited to purveyors of business-to-business products.  This last criteria is one of the reasons IBM has eschewed cryptocurrency applications, said Auer-Welsbach.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Most companies in the space are in the cryptocurrency field, which we don’t see from a B2B perspective as the ultimate angle for us to add value.""  Plus, IBM's main priority continues to be to creating critical mass around its blockchain platforms (IBM Blockchain Platform and Hyperledger Fabric), and this trumps generating revenue on any investments.  In order for a company to attract Auer-Welsbach's attention, then, it has to have a proven, repeatably successful business model, with multiple clients, making it better suited for the kinds of interaction that create a strong sense of community around a platform.  For example, IBM Ventures recently opened up its coffers as the lead investor of a $15 million round in Lightbend, an open-source platform for users of the Scala machine-learning language that already has multiple corporate customers.  Building the fabric  But because there aren't many blockchain companies at that level, Hyperledger Fabric remains IBM's pride and joy for cultivating its work with the blockchain industry.  Within Hyperledger Fabric, groups of like-minded firms often develop into more formalized consortia – such as the global trade digitization effort led by shipping giant Maersk and a food safety effort spearheaded by Walmart.  In interview with CoinDesk, the general manager of IBM's blockchain unit, Marie Wieck, elaborated on Auer-Welsbach's notion that the company wants to develop more such communities.  Specifically, Wieck said that IBM's internal investment in cloud computing could be seen as the ""plumbing layer"" of blockchain ecosystems, while outside IBM, getting institutional investors like Boldstart VC to back companies building enterprise solutions on Hyperledger Fabric is key to its mission.  In his work with Fabric, Auer-Welsbach is on the lookout for services that can be implemented with only minimal consulting, and platforms that can be adjusted for new industries with just a few ""little tweaks here and there.""  He concluded:  ""That's the time when I would say this is really interesting to us to invest in.""

The scope of the project is outlined in a new paper published this week by the The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, which also includes a series of questions aimed to spur public debate around digitized businesses and services.  Though none of the questions explicitly mention blockchain, the document highlights the technology in several areas, and signals that the government in Australia sees a prominent role for blockchain in the future.  As the paper explains in one passage:  ""The next phase of the internet, where we are always on and always connected, has the potential to transform our economy even further. Horizontal platform technologies like distributed ledger technology (for example, blockchain) and machine learning will support innovation and productivity right across the economy.""  Indeed, the government in Australia has gone to some lengths to encourage development around the technology, both for cryptocurrencies as well as broader blockchain applications. Agencies within the government have also produced research studies investigating blockchain, with two in particular being released earlier this summer.

42400453,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJcFf,1505988007,CFTC Chair Giancarlo: Embracing Blockchain Is in the 'National Interest',"Blockchain is in America's ""national interest.""  That's according to J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who issued the bold proclamation in remarks at a gathering of government technology executives in Washington, D.C. Wednesday morning.  But while the blockchain industry has been encouraging regulators and government agencies to embrace the technology for years, this acknowledgment might have more oomph behind it. For one, unique to this statement was the size and caliber of the audience receiving it – in attendance was a group of roughly 270 leaders from over 40 U.S. government agencies.  ""Distributed ledger and blockchain technologies ... are going to challenge orthodoxies that are foundational to our financial infrastructure,"" Giancarlo said.  Giancarlo continued:  ""Everything we do has been digitized. The one thing that has not yet been digitized is regulation. We're still very much an analog regulator of digital markets.""  And most importantly, Giancarlo stressed that it is imperative that U.S. regulatory structures catch up with the fast-moving digital economy.  Overcoming hurdles  Elsewhere in the talk, Giancarlo argued that government bodies must go beyond just understanding blockchain by finding ways to utilize the technology in an agency or regulatory setting.  ""Whether it's the promise of blockchain-enabled digital identities, improved regulatory reporting and surveillance, greater efficiency in clearing and settlement processes, more transparent flow of information – these innovations hold promise in benefiting the American public,"" he said.  One ""perfect example,"" Giancarlo went on, would be using a distributed ledger system to implement the rule set put forth by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Passed in 2010, the legislation requires financial institutions to report swap trade info to a central repository.  The intent of the rule is to provide more transparency into a financial institution's exposure to other banks and better assess systemic risk. But because of technological limitations, that initiative has hit stumbling blocks – issues that Giancarlo believes blockchain could overcome.  But while Giancarlo has mentioned blockchain's ability to cut through the financial system's complexity in the past, his statements at the event give a more detailed view of just how the technology could help.  Striking a balance  With all the optimism, Giancarlo did note that the digitization of modern financial markets should be a ""delicate balance"" of innovation and investor protections.  ""Current enthusiasm for certain cryptocurrencies shouldn't blind investors and regulators to the many risks that are evolving in this space,"" he said.  This is particularly notable in that the CFTC recently found certain crypto tokens to be commodities, and earlier this year, granted cryptocurrency derivatives clearinghouse LedgerX a license to trade commodities.  Giancarlo was quick to say, though, that the agency has no intention of overstepping its jurisdiction by defining how all tokens should be classified.  Under Giancarlo's leadership, the CFTC has brought blockchain into the fold through its blockchain research and development initiative LabCFTC. While this approach means boundary-pushing is inevitable, he says such dynamics are healthy and necessary to modernizing the legacy regulatory framework.  Giancarlo concluded:  ""That makes sense because our rules weren't designed for this technology. In fact, our rules were designed for markets that don't exist anymore, and we need to update them.""

In a release yesterday, the European Union's executive arm outlined its intent to introduce a new directive focused on digital crimes, citing recent ransomware attacks in the region and abroad. Part of that plan would involve the creation of a European cybersecurity agency to spearhead such efforts.  Included in the proposal is a plan to beef up punishments for those involved in related cybercrimes, including ransomware attacks.  The commission said:  ""The proposed directive will strengthen the ability of law enforcement authorities to tackle this form of crime by expanding the scope of the offences related to information systems to all payment transactions, including transactions through virtual currencies.""  That the EU's leadership would move in this direction is perhaps unsurprising given past moves to regulate the bloc's cryptocurrency startups more closely.  Further, possible changes to EU regulations related to cryptocurrencies could extend beyond crimes involving ransomware, additional public documents show. In a separate release outlining ""non-cash payment fraud"" in the EU, officials said that existing statutes aren't equipped to account for crimes involving the tech.  ""The current rules on criminalization of non-cash payment fraud are set out in the Council Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA dating back to 2001,"" the document states. ""It has become clear that those rules no longer reflect today’s realities and do not sufficiently address new challenges and technological developments such as virtual currencies and mobile payments.""

42400449,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJcBj,1505980805,Searching for Problems? James Altucher to Bitcoin Critics: You're Dead Wrong,"Only invest in things that solve problems.  At least that's a strategy James Altucher, the former hedge fund manager, business blogger and best-selling author, places at the center of his investment strategy. With that outlook, it might seem strange that he so bullishly invests in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – emerging technologies typically accused of being ""solutions searching for a problem.""  But Altucher thinks that claim is nonsense.  In his eyes, cryptocurrency solves a host of problems caused by the fiat-based financial system – particularly, the fees and time it takes to send international payments.  Today, every international payment must pass through a network of local banks, central banks and international wire services, taking seven or eight hops to get to their destination, and with every hop involving fees, potential errors, threats to privacy and other security risks, Altucher said.  And these are the kinds of problems cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are solutions for. Even with banks and financial incumbents looking for ways to utilize private blockchain technologies, Altucher is a big believer in cryptocurrency's potential to take over the roles of financial intermediaries like banks.  Because while technology may be shrinking the economic world, the current payment systems provided by banks are still stuck in the 20th century – a sentiment that continues to guide his bullish thesis on the space.  A clear worth  According to Altucher, multiple cryptocurrencies are needed to solve the multiple problems inherent in finance and commerce today.  While bitcoin could take the role of international payments from banks, he argues ethereum, and its native token, ether, are better suited to provide a cheap and easy way to escrow funds in the form of the platform's more sophisticated self-executing smart contracts.  But, though, Altucher is extremely bullish on the future of cryptocurrency as a whole, he's surprisingly bearish on the majority of cryptocurrencies now trading. In fact, he estimates that 880 of the 900 or so cryptocurrencies in circulation will ultimately prove worthless.  Altucher's pessimism is entirely consistent with his thesis about problem solving. To him, most cryptocurrencies are not solving a clear problem. Although, he's also open to taking the advice of experts and others that have done their homework.  As an example of both strategies at work, Altucher cites his recent investment in Filecoin, a distributed storage network that recently sold tokens to institutional investors.  Filecoin uses the contract management feature of ether and, according to Altucher, solves several key problems of centralized cloud storage companies — like Dropbox, Amazon and Google. Advocates of decentralized storage like Altucher believe decentralization will make storage more robust, permanent and available while decreasing the cost.  And that could be a huge payoff:  ""Imagine the entire storage market suddenly becomes decentralized? That's a huge $100 billion industry, potentially.""  Toward 'data-ism'  Altucher sees cryptocurrency (or ""data currencies"" as he'd prefer to call them) as the next step forward in the long progression of the global financial system. Each step forward solved problems that the previous system didn't fix.  For instance, gold solved many of the barter system's problems by allowing people to price everything using the precious metal as a common currency. But, it's neither safe nor practical to travel with sacks of gold bars, so paper currency replaced gold.  And then paper currency became ""more electric,"" Altucher said.  Banks can track how much money we have by using accounts tied to debit and credit card numbers, and by virtualizing money this way, business is even easier to transact than it was using paper currency.  This transition, according to Altucher, has profoundly philosophical roots, and won't end until all transactions and currencies become totally data driven.  Referencing the work of writer Yuval Noah Harari, Altucher believes we're in the process of moving from theism, via humanism, to ""data-ism.""  That might be a lot of mystical ""isms"" for an investor to swallow, but Altucher makes the philosophy a lot more practical with a metaphor: If you got sick in the old days, you prayed to god to fix your health problems; then you went to a doctor to fix your illness; and now you go to data to fix your health.  ""You get an MRI. You get an EEG. The data figures out what your illness is,"" he said, continuing:  ""If you look at every industry it all boils down to that same trend.""  And, according to Altucher, that trend is very much alive with currency today, where we're moving from ""In God We Trust"" to the more data-driven ""In Cryptography We Trust.""
