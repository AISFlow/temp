42381020,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX93H67,1531558228,A US Election Probe Implicated Bitcoin – And the Reaction Was Swift,"Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general of the U.S., sparked a social firestorm when he revealed that the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted on Friday used bitcoin to fund hacking efforts during the 2016 presidential election.  As CoinDesk reported  earlier today, the defendants named in the indictment are accused of gaining access to computer systems utilized by the Democratic Party, including those used by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, in order to disseminate that information during the election. Notably, the accused used bitcoin – including funds they mined themselves – to pay for web domains and other services utilized during their alleged scheme.  Unsurprisingly, the news quickly spread through social media, inciting a mix of incredulity, suspicion and – in some cases – amusement from observers.  Yet the story also drew the attention of at least one member of Congress, who took to Twitter to argue that ""the crypto industry needs to step their game up.""  Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's tweet, as might be expected, drew swift condemnation from members of the crypto community.  While much of Friday's social chatter is focused on other elements of the indictment and the broader investigation, the story seems to have elicited remarks from some not normally prone to comment on crypto-related stories.  Indeed, the news sparked a multitude of responses, from the dismissive to the downright hostile. Some saw it as another scandal to taint the cryptocurrency sphere.  Another interpretation: that today's indictment was intended to influence an upcoming meeting between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin.  There were also some lighter takes in the mix – though how light they are may depend on interpretation.  Lessons to be learned?  Some commentators took the news as a clear sign that the U.S. government is serious about using the public network characteristics of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to trace transactions.  An investor named Simon Mikhailovich noted that the indictment and the fact that the FBI was able to document virtually every step of the perpetrators should remind all investors that their activities on blockchain are easily traceable and not hidden from view.

42421799,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXtUKr,1531555840,Muh Monopoly! How a Banker's Talk Sparked All Kinds of Crypto Mockery,"Last week, Agustin Carstens, the head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), widely considered the central bank of central banks – told cryptocurrency makers to ""stop trying to create money.""  And the crypto community promptly had a field day with those remarks.  The BIS head has, to date, adopted a largely hostile tone toward cryptocurrencies. Back in February, he called bitcoin ""a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster"" during a lecture.  Carstens isn't alone in his view, to be sure. Billionaire Warren Buffett, for example, said earlier this year that bitcoin is ""rat poisoned squared,"" while JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon famously declared in 2017 that bitcoin is ""a fraud"" (though he later said he regretted issuing those remarks).  And while Carstens has long held this position, it was his remarks last week – essentially calling for a moratorium on te creation of new cryptos – that drew the ire of many in the community on social media. He also argued that ""it's a fallacy to think money can be created from nothing"" – a contention that drew more than a few derisive comments.  It was developer Jameson Lopp who perhaps best summed up that collective sentiment:  Indeed, many drew issue with the fact that an institution tied to central banks – which manage the money systems of economies and serve as lenders of that money – would call out anyone over the creation of money from nothing.  It's worth noting that, at the time of the bitcoin network's official launch in January 2009, the world's financial sector was, to quote Satoshi Nakamoto, ""on the brink of collapse."" That line – ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"" – was immortalized in bitcoin's genesis block.  As Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan quipped, bitcoin's creation was steeped in the context of mistrust in banks.  Commentator Matt Odell argued that Carstens got at least one thing ""almost right"": that trust is a valuable thing.  But in this case, however, it's not central banks that are earning the trust of everyday folk.  While Carstens never came out and declared that cryptocurrencies pose a competitive threat to central bank-backed monies, his organization has touched on the subject in the past.  Last month, the BIS published a report that examined them, concluding that ""the decentralized technology of cryptocurrencies, however sophisticated, is a poor substitute for the solid institutional backing of money.""  Harsh stance aside, the BIS noted that ""the underlying technology may have promise in other fields"" – something other central banks have highlighted before.  Whether Carstens intended to or not, his comments came across as a bit of a competitive challenge to some in the crypto space.  Indeed, Carstens' contention was ultimately positioned as an argument for fiat currencies in favor of cryptocurrencies.  And – perhaps unsurprising – some observers saw Carstens' commentary as a sign that they should, in fact, buy more cryptocurrency.  Ultimately, Carstens' call to stop creating new kinds of money may have actually inspired people to do the opposite.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/07/14/muh-monopoly-how-a-bankers-talk-sparked-all-kinds-of-crypto-mockery,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a0cfbecba24f62e607f642cd26e2a1f84a49afd-1500x993.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
