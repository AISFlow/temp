42400324,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJKC1,1504133945,"Barclays, HSBC Join Settlement Coin as Bank Blockchain Test Enters New Phase","Several of the world's largest banks have today revealed a series of steps to advance a project aimed at making it easier for central banks to issue currencies on a blockchain.  Called Utility Settlement Coin (USC), the project is designed to help prepare the way for central bank cryptocurrencies by making it easier for global banks to conduct a wide variety of transactions with each other using collateralized assets on a custom-built blockchain.  Work on the next phase of the project — the last before a live implementation — will include six members revealed today, Barclays, CIBC, Credit Suisse, HSBC, MUFG and State Street, building alongside founding financial institutions UBS, BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander, NEX and blockchain startup Clearmatics.  While USC will be limited in scope to start, Hyder Jaffrey, UBS director of strategic investment and fintech innovation, explained the potential impact the project could one day have, telling CoinDesk:  ""It may well inform the way central banks choose to move things forward. We see it as a stepping stone to a future where central banks issue their own [cryptocurrency] at some point.""  But before the platform can become just that, Jaffrey and the USC team are prioritizing further development, having created a kind of testnet for the project that seeks to back cryptotokens with collateral.  Part of the group's third phase revealed today is the testing of a formal transfer of ownership and an accurate cash equivalents definition for the transfer, in an effort to mimic what a real-time end-to-end transaction between members would look like.  This is ""absolutely essential in preparing the platform to go live,"" Jaffrey told CoinDesk.  First, testing  In that transfer test, the group will explore using a collateralized token, which Jaffrey said could simplify the buying and selling of assets via a complicated network of middlemen down to a single, fiat-based transaction conducted on a blockchain.  In short, the collateralized token will be given directly to the owner of the asset, instead of going through the traditional network of clearinghouses.  ""We have a very strong feeling that we have a workable structure for the USC which underpins things like settlement finality, transfer of ownership, a cash equivalence definition,"" said Jaffrey.  Driving those business requirements are the members themselves, which Jaffrey said the group is adding slowly, in parallel with the ""momentum"" of the project.  The head of fintech partnerships and strategy at HSBC, Kaushalya Somasundaram, reiterated Jaffrey's belief that USC could help delineate a path forward for central bank digital currencies, one of the reasons HSBC joined to begin with.  Explaining how she sees the token eventually working, Somasundaram told CoinDesk:  ""The settlement coin will be a collateralized digital currency, backed by cash assets at a central bank, which allows us to transfer ownership easily through the exchange of USCs, thus reducing process complexity and the time taken for settlement.""  Then, ambition  First revealed in 2015 by Swiss banking giant UBS and Clearmatics, the Utility Settlement Coin concept represents the latest in a growing number of blockchain projects that could be amplified by fiat currencies issued on a blockchain.  Echoing statements recently made by a Citi executive, Jaffrey explained that paying for assets tokenized on a blockchain with traditional fiat currency ran the risk of reintroducing the same security vulnerabilities of the centralized model.  With those vulnerabilities in mind, last year, USC initiated Phase II of its work, which focused on the legal and regulatory compliance of decentralizing the system.  According to Jaffrey, that structural work is now complete, and testing elements of the technology deemed crucial to the way financial institutions do business, but in a ""pre-live"" environment is beginning.  The newly commenced Phase III is expected to run for about 12 months, at which time phase IV, what Jaffrey called the ""go-live phase"" will likely begin. The first live collateralized token exchange using the platform could occur as soon as the end of 2018, he said.  And then, according to Jaffrey, the goal is wide scale adoption of blockchain platforms that interoperate with each other.  Addressing that opporunity, Somasundaram concluded:  ""It is a very good step forward in terms of going for more ambitious projects such as central bank digital currencies in the future.""

42400331,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJKEy,1504119602,ICO Oversight? Israeli Regulators Form Token Sale Study Committee,"Regulators in Israel have formed a new committee to study the applicability of domestic securities laws to initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Announced today  , the development sees the Israeli Securities Authority panel putting together recommendations for potentially regulating ICOs. A report containing those recommendations sometime before the end of December. Officials working on the committee will also look into the approaches taken by other regulators worldwide, as well as the ""the enforceability of securities laws in this area,"" among other subjects.  With the move, Israel's securities watchdog becomes the latest regulator of its kind to wade into the murky question of regulating ICOs.  Just last week, regulators in Canada released a staff noticing outlining how that, under its view, some blockchain-based tokens count as securities. At the same time, the Canada Securities Administrators (CSA) struck a proactive note and encouraged companies planning an ICO to reach out to the body.  Other regulators, including those in Singapore and the US, have also revealed their plans for regulating ICOs. Like Canada, their general stance is that while some token sales qualify as securities offerings, others – particularly tokens that have some kind of independent utility – do not.  It's a noteworthy development as well given that the country plays home to several startups that have pursued or are planning to raise funds through the model. Perhaps most notable among those is Bancor, which raised more than $150 million through a token sale in June.  To date, nearly $2 billion has been raised through ICOs, according to data from CoinDesk's ICO Tracker.

42400330,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJKFx,1504116304,New AMD Graphics Card Sells Out In Minutes Amid Crypto Mining Boom,"Chip maker AMD rolled out a new graphics card (GPU) earlier this week – and the product swiftly sold out in minutes.  Tech bloggers closely watched the release of the Vega 56, which was released on popular online marketplaces like Newegg and Ebay on August 28. As expected – given huge demand for GPUs by the world's cryptocurrency miners – the vast majority of listings were unavailable after the first five minutes.  Also exacerbating the situation are reports that manufacturing issues have led to a constrain on supplies for the new Vega card (which was sold in two varieties) and rumors that distributors may be jacking up the asking price to boost their revenues amid the huge demand.  CoinDesk previously reported that companies like AMD as well as rival GPU maker Nvidia have been moving to capitalize on the influx of GPU buyers who are looking to use the hardware to mine cryptocurrencies like ethereum. Mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, creating new tokens as a reward int he process.  Even still, AMD isn't banking on cryptocurrency quite yet, declaring earlier this summer on an earnings call that it didn't view the tech as a long-term opportunity.  That said, the company has perhaps quietly worked to improve conditions for cryptocurrency miners that use its product, as shown by the release of mining-related software derivers earlier this month.

In a new update, a representative for the long-running and infamous bitcoin exchange outlined how the relaunch would happen over a several week-period, occurring in three stages.  During the first part, user information will be transferred to an as-yet-unnamed company ""in full compliance with the European directives on personal data and in compliance with European legislation in this field"", according to the post. This is expected to be completed by September 15.  After that, an unnamed financial investment firm – referenced in past posts as a key part of the revival plan – will move to restructure the exchange's digital assets, as well as begin an accounting of the transferred user data. In the last stage, the investment firm will ""audit and register personal data in accordance with AML laws and KYC identification procedures.""  The representative went on to write (in a translated statement):  ""In parallel with the legal issue of restructuring, users will be given the opportunity to check the integrity of the digital balance in the user's account, and users will be able to make changes in the security of the account. For chat and support, chat will be available. For these purposes, the service will be launched on the old domain (btc-e.nz). You will be able to log in and check your balance before recounting.""  As CoinDesk previously reported, BTC- was targeted by US authorities earlier this summer. A Russian national was arrested in Greece on July 26, and later that day, the US unveiled a 21-count indictment against the exchange, as well as a $110 million fine for a host of alleged money laundering violations.  Yet just days after the crackdown, representatives for the exchange, taking to the Bitcoin Talk forum, pledged to revive the service and repay users who lost money when the exchange was seized. Part of that plan, subsequent updates revealed, includes the release of a blockchain-based debt token.

DOVU, which reportedly already has notable investors on board, plans to create a secure environment for individuals and companies to share any data relating to mobility – such as location, distance traveled and weather conditions.  According to TechCrunch, the startup has already received an undisclosed amount of funding from InMotion Ventures, an investment arm of automaker Jaguar Land Rover, and Creative England, a fund backed by the U.K. government for the support of creative industries.  The data collected will be used to create more efficient services, such as combining ""car data with insurance data to calculate smarter policies"" or ""geolocation data in conjunction with weather statistics to inform ride-hailing companies,"" according to a statement.  In exchange for this information, DOVU will offer its own ethereum-based token called a DOV. Earned tokens could then be used to purchase ""mobility services"" such as public transport, the firm said.  The DOV token will be launched via an initial coin offering (ICO) taking place on October 3, and will be spendable in decentralised applications built on the open-source DOVU protocol, the company website states.  Also aimed to provide ""payment across mobility services,"" the token could potentially be used for riding public transport, vehicle rentals, and enabling users to share their vehicle or travel data.  Heading up the firm is CEO Irfon Watkins, who has worked on other ventures in the past including data-driven video advertising platform Coull. The DOVU advisory board notably includes Lars Klawitter, director of the Ethereum Foundation and general manager of Rolls Royce Bespoke.

Called LocalMonero.co, the website will connect buyers and sellers of the cryptocurrency based on country of residence. Users can meet and exchange monero for cash, or buy it online from a local seller.  Created in 2013, monero is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that obscures user transactional data by use a cryptographic procedure called ""ring signatures.""  Like the currency itself, LocalMonero.co is also committed to privacy, according to its founders. Launching the website in a Reddit post, user ""optocomp"" stated:  ""We don't keep any IP logs and we don't require users to have emails. We keep trade chat logs for 180 days for purposes of dispute mediation. The logs are encrypted and all the attachments uploaded in the chat are watermarked and encrypted to prevent unauthorized use.""  Still, the quest for privacy is slightly complex, with the premise of the website being to connect traders based on locational data. LocalMonero defaults to Google APIs for this purpose, however, it also allows users to manually override the feature by entering their own longitude and latitude when searching for local trades.  The timing of the launch would seem opportune, however.  Monero grabbed headlines last week when it saw at 80% value increase in one day, as the price per coin rocketed from $35 up to $95. The price hike followed an announcement that South Korean exchange Bithumb would soon add monero as a trading pair.  The cryptocurrency was officially introduced to Bithumb on August 27, and reached an all-time high of $153.31 a day later.

42400336,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJKKs,1504098007,Why Big Investors Are Betting Real Money on a Kik Cryptocurrency,"If there were any doubts about whether Kik would be able to attract investors to its initial coin offering (ICO), it's safe to say they have been put to rest.  In an announcement yesterday, the mobile messaging app provider revealed it has already raised $50 million from investors to launch its new ""kin"" token, and that it intends to raise a further $75 million in a public token distribution to be held in September.  It's a landmark for the nascent industry, one that finds a mainstream brand with millions of users backing a nascent funding mechanism that has been equally praised and parodied.  And while critics of ICOs, and Kik's particular plan, will remain, investors believe the kin token will boost the value of the company, and they're putting millions of dollars up to back the idea.  In this light, prospective investors might be wondering, how, exactly, does Kik plan to monetize its platform using the new token?  CoinDesk spoke to Tanner Philp, a manager of special initiatives at Kik, to get a better sense of how the company plans to reach its goal of making kin into a successful, general-purpose cryptocurrency.  When asked for specifics, Philp gave perhaps a surprising answer:  ""One of the areas of immediate opportunity is the over 100,000 bot developers, who have created over 180,000 bots. Those bots could be anything from entertainment to content creation to games.""  Send in the bots  Bots are essentially automated chat robots that allow users to engage in natural-language conversation with AI that perform specific tasks, such as getting a weather forecast or ordering a pizza.  These high-tech tools are often seen as having great potential to deliver targeted advertising to users, especially in the younger demographics, which dominate Kik's user base.  As an example, the firm cites an internal case study using a bot built on its platform in cooperation with Paramount Pictures. The bot was designed to promote the release of a ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie prior to its release, and it delivered a total of 147.5 million impressions and averaged 60 messages exchanged, according to information provided by Kik.  In the future, Kik foresees such activities being further boost through the use of a cryptocurrency that can incentivize both bot creation and user interaction.  But its plans for monetization don't stop with bots: Kik's next step is even more ambitious.  A planned economic incentive mechanism called the Kin Rewards Engine will have the goal of enabling any consumer application to financially reward end-user actions on the Kik platform.  Kik told CoinDesk that functionality such as the ability to pay someone in kin to watch a livestream or to reward end-users for hosting content would be possible. Or as Philp succinctly phrased it: ""We view successful integrations of kin to be two-sided marketplaces where users can earn and spend.""  Investor appeal  Likewise, Ryan Zurrer, principal at Polychain Capital, is bullish on his investment in Kik for different reasons.  In Polychain's view, cryptocurrency-powered social media is going to be a very important use case for blockchain technology – and Zurrer believes Kik stands to capitalize on it by bringing a large cohort of young users to the tech for the first time.  He added that Kik has more than 80 engineers in their Ontario, Canada, offices, and that its large pool of technical talent has the ability to push the entire ecosystem forward.  That talent will be crucial, according to Zurrer, because the ethereum blockchain itself – on which the kin token is based – has not yet reached the level of scalability required to handle the transaction throughput that the Kik ecosystem would imply. These inherent limitations mean that the kin team is going to need to develop the core functionality that will push the platform forward, he said.  Finally, he said, Kik has a highly talented executive team that knows how to manage technically challenging products while growing an organization.  Zurrer summed up Polychain's confidence in Kik saying:  ""For the first time, we have a project that checks all the boxes: compelling value proposition for users, deep technical skills and a strong management structure.""  'Fascinating' shift  Similarly, Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Pantera Capital, summed up his confidence in Kik, calling it the first ""real company"" to tokenize their business model.  ""It will be a fascinating moment to see a venture-based company converting into a token-based company,"" he said.  Morehead added that Kik ran an in-app virtual currency, which was known as Kik Points, for three years, so the company already has experience with similar technology.  Joey Krug, Pantera's co-chief investment officer, added some interesting distinctions about what his company believes makes kin such a valuable currency.  ""Our core thesis is that we don't like transaction tokens that are rent seeking – meaning tokens that insert themselves as middle men and collect fees. Kin is a new incentive model,"" he said.  Kik, Krug argued, is creating a model around a token ecosystem where the developer or content creator has the capacity to get paid in kin for the intellectual property that they create on the network.  As Krug said:  ""If you're a developer, and your application becomes popular, you're going to capture some of that value. The same goes for user generated content. If you create a post or an image that goes viral you can receive some of that value back in the form of the kin token.""  On the other hand, it is important to note that no less august a social media network than Facebook once tried – and famously failed – to build a user system that incentivized user interactions through a long-deceased program called Facebook Credits.  Still, if investor comments are any indication, Kik won't be a case of history repeated.

As CoinDesk has previously reported, Coinbase is pushing back against a court decision from June, when a Florida judge sided with a group of Cryptsy customers seeking damages from the startup. Those users alleged that Coinbase – at least unwittingly – abetted the theft of millions of dollars by Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon by allowing him to deposit and later exchange bitcoin for dollars.  Coinbase unsuccessfully fought the case in Florida, countering that affected users were bound by agreements with Vernon, and that any claims should be brought in private arbitration. After U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that Cryptsy's customers could move ahead, Coinbase filed an appeal (though the startup would go on to request a delay to file its initial arguments).  In its appellate brief filing last week, lawyers for Coinbase reiterated the argument that users of Cryptsy would need to pursue any claims through arbitration.  They wrote:  ""It is that contract that created the alleged duties to Cryptsy's users that, according to plaintiff, Coinbase failed to discharge in a proper manner. Accordingly, as a matter of equity, plaintiff is bound by the arbitration clause: equity will simply not allow Plaintiff to enforce the provisions of the contract that he likes (those provisions that created duties as between Coinbase and Cryptsy) while repudiating another provision of the same contract that he does not like (the arbitration clause).""  The update is the latest in a lawsuit that's an offshoot of the class-action suit filed against Cryptsy and Vernon in January 2015, which came days after the Florida-based cryptocurrency exchange collapsed amid allegations of fraud.  The startup's failure followed months of growing complaints by customers over withdrawals and growing fears that the exchange was insolvent. Vernon later denied that he had stolen the funds, pointing a finger at hackers whom he alleged had struck the exchange over a several-year period.

42400323,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJK94,1504090809,Citi Speaks: State-Backed Cryptocurrency Key to Blockchain Adoption,"State-backed cryptocurrencies are key to the adoption of blockchain technology, according to an executive at investment banking group Citi.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, the bank's recently appointed head of core cash management for Asia-Pacific, Morgan McKenney, positioned its new CitiConnect blockchain project within a larger context – one in which the ultimate success of distributed ledger technology depends on the advent of fiat currencies issued on a blockchain.  According to McKenney, every payment method has an environment in which it's best suited, and to fully unlock the project's potential – and any number of blockchain environments – cryptocurrency is the most suitable payment method.  But in spite of current limits that have been placed on the $187 billion bank's research into the technology, she explained how atomic swaps could be further empowered if any number of cryptoassets could be purchased with a blockchain-based fiat currency.  McKenney explained:  ""If you had a digital dollar, if you had a digital pound, exactly fungible with the note in your wallet and the dollar in your bank account, then you'd be willing to use that digital currency much more throughout your ongoing daily transactions.""  While cryptocurrencies have so far only been issued via decentralized blockchain protocols and in private corporate pre-sales, she argued that a central bank issuance would not only enhance the liquidity of new assets, but also give rise to entirely new markets.  For example, Citi's CitiConnect looks to simplify the buying and selling of private market assets, but using a cryptocurrency in such a transaction could allow blockchain to fulfill its potential by bringing liquidity to a ""broader range of assets,"" according to McKenney.  Emergence of digital marketplaces  And these new markets will come into existence only if the right mechanisms, like state-backed cryptocurrencies, are created.  ""If you believe that more assets will eventually be captured and contained in blockchain systems, and therefore you would want to exchange them, sell them, buy them, you need a mechanism of payment that works in that ecosystem,"" McKenney said.  For example, currently, ownership records of private market securities and other assets are largely held by lawyers and trusted third parties, requiring the presence of middlemen to conduct trades.  As part of Citi's work to modernize that process, the bank partnered with both Nasdaq and blockchain startup Chain to launch CitiConnect, which McKenney described as a ""bridge to the blockchain horizon.""  The platform is designed to connect existing financial rails with blockchain so that some of the efficiencies of using Chain's distributed ledger technology can be achieved using state-backed fiat currency.  Should state governments even issue traditional currencies on a blockchain they would supercharge the technology, she said, enablling instantaneous swaps with other crypto-assets issued on a blockchain.  Keeping the door open  In spite of having managed an index that shows the ""readiness"" of 90 countries to accept ""digital money,"" Citi itself has so far restricted its exploration to areas that don't involve cryptocurrencies.  In addition to looking at other potential collaboration opportunities for its CitiConnect platform, the bank has invested in Chain, Digital Asset Holdings and Axoni – all three of which offer blockchain solutions that don't include a native cryptocurrency.  While McKenney said Citi is ""not exploring cryptocurrency outside of state-backed digital money"" at this time, she left the door open for possible related projects in the future, concluding:  “I wouldn’t want to make statement that we’re explicitly ruling out anything, but we’re taking a strategic approach that reflects the earlier stage of blockchain versus some other technologies.

In an email addressing other bitcoin cash developers over the weekend, Amaury Sechet, lead developer of the main bitcoin cash client, Bitcoin ABC, argued that the network should pursue an aggressive means of increasing its transaction capacity.  Sechet wrote:  ""If we want to scale big, we'll have to do a [hard fork] from time to time.""  This could be a questionable plan, however, since critics contend that developers shouldn't have the power to enforce hard fork changes not everyone in the ecosystem will agree with. Further, since such changes could lead to splits into competing assets, it's widely believed developers should deploy changes in a way that prioritizes keeping the network together.  Supporters, though, argue that hard forks offer a way to make more types of software upgrades, and give users more choice over technical decisions.  Pushback remains  In an effort to highlight those benefits, Sechet proposed a rough roadmap of hard fork changes he believes will lead to the best future scaling, including changing how transactions are ordered and block data is computed.  According to the developer: ""There seems to be a few changes that are relatively obvious, but hard to advocate for in a climate where [hard forks] are not acceptable.""  And his conclusion may be right.  Already, there's disagreement about how often hard forks should be deployed. In an earlier email thread, bitcoin classic (another client compatible with bitcoin cash) developer Tom Zander argued against executing too many changes that way, saying:  ""At every hard fork we put a strain on the ecosystem. Less is better.""  Other upgrades  Forks or otherwise, this isn't the only challenge bitcoin cash developers will have to decide on.  For one, developers are discussing better mining difficulty algorithms, since the current one, while enticing to bitcoin miners in the short term, might lead to problems for the cryptocurrency down the line, especially since bitcoin cash hasn't yet been widely adopted.  Further, in an effort to entice more users to use the cryptocurrency, developers want to keep transaction fees close to zero – an effort to further differentiate itself from bitcoin (which has seen higher average transaction fees as of late).  ""We want to bring back zero-fee transactions ASAP,"" bitcoin cash developer Calin Culianu told CoinDesk. ""This lets people that want to save money transact cheaper. This is bitcoin the way it was back in 2013, when I first fell in love with it.""  Though, he admitted this could ""open the floodgates to spam attacks"" and have a negative impact on the network, it provides further evidence of the design decisions currently being considered in an attempt to differentiate the cryptocurrency.

42400321,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJK76,1504083660,WhopperCoin: Burger King Russia Launches Blockchain Loyalty Program,"Burger King restaurants in Russia are set to begin offering a cryptocurrency-based loyalty program.  According to a blog post on Burger King Russia's website, the ""WhopperCoin"" initiative will see customers receive one blockchain-based token for each ruble they spend in-store. Once 1,700 WhopperCoins have been accrued, according to the blog, they can be redeemed for a free burger.  All told, 1 billion WhopperCoins will be created and distributed – facilitated by the Waves token creation platform – though it's not clear at this time when the program will be rolled out. A mobile app is reportedly also in the works, set to be released on iOS and Android platforms.  Curiously, in statements, a representative for Burger King Russia framed the program through the perspective of investment, rather than rewarding customers for repeat purchases.  ""Now, [the Whopper] is not just a burger, which is loved in more than 90 countries, but also a tool for investment. Experts predict a rapid increase in the cost of cryptocurrency. Therefore, eating [a Whopper] today – a reserve for financial well-being tomorrow,"" Ivan Shestov, communications director of Burger King Russia, said in a statement.  Burger King Corporation, the brand's central corporate entity, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42400340,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJKOo,1504080005,Why Miners Are Mining Bitcoin Cash – and Losing Money Doing It,"Jimmy Song is a bitcoin developer and principal architect at blockchain technology startup Paxos.  In this opinion piece, Song discusses mining patterns on the bitcoin cash blockchain, theorizing on what they might indicate about the incentives powering the new cryptocurrency.      Over the weekend, the bitcoin cash blockchain experienced a notable technical change.  Like the bitcoin blockchain from which it forked, bitcoin cash is hard-wired to adjust how hard it is for miners to claim its rewards, and on Saturday, it saw such a change. As a result, bitcoin cash was made 300% more difficult to mine.  This, in turn, caused the profitability of the coin to decrease dramatically. Many miners left for bitcoin, and for about 10 hours only a few blocks were found.  As a result, emergency difficulty adjustments (a technical mechanism unique to bitcoin cash) were triggered, causing the difficulty to drop enough for miners to begin switching back.  What's interesting, however, is that at the time, bitcoin cash was still less profitable to mine than bitcoin by about 20%. Still, many miners, including those using pools like BTC.Top, ViaBTC and AntPool continued dedicating computing power to the blockchain.  This means these miners were likely giving up profit that they could have earned had they been mining bitcoin. So what gives? And why are miners mining at a loss?  This is not an easy question to answer and my analysis here is speculative. But, here are some possibilities:  Miners are committed to fork  Miners may be committed to making the new cryptocurrency work, as they may have now accrued a large bitcoin cash position.  Armed with this vested interest, they may believe slow blocks will cause bitcoin cash to tank, so they may be mining to keep the network working smoothly.  The argument against this is that during the 10-hour window after the non-emergency difficulty adjustment, many of the same miners left. If consistent blocks were the major concern, there should have been more mining power on bitcoin during that interval.  Miners think the price will rise  The miners mining now may be thinking that the bitcoin cash price will increase in the near future to make mining worthwhile. A 30–40 percent increase in the bitcoin price relative to bitcoin would certainly make their mining profitable, and they may be waiting until then to sell.  These miners may have insider information about a large buy order or may be just hoping for larger fluctuations of bitcoin cash price.  Miners are getting subsidies  Another theory is that there may be bitcoin cash supporters that are subsidizing mining in some way, behind the scenes.  This could be something like an over-the-counter market for bitcoin cash where buyers are paying a higher price than the exchanges to incentivize mining. If the buyers demand freshly minted bitcoin cash, this would effectively make it so miners were the only supply that could satisfy this particular demand.  Similarly, bitcoin cash supporters could simply be paying pools to point hash power the blockchain network.  Conclusion  Ultimately, there are now more questions than answers.  We don't really know why miners are mining bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin. But, we know that at the very least, they aren't making as much money as they could, and this means these miners are paying some opportunity cost in order to mine bitcoin cash.
