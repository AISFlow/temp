42428466,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8BNh,1516918821,Bitcoin Startup BitGo to Buy Asset Custodian,"Blockchain security startup BitGo is acquiring a digital asset custodian based in South Dakota that holds more than $12 billion in assets.  The firm announced today that it had struck a deal, subject to final approvals, to acquire the Kingdom Trust Company as well as Kingdom Services. The acquisition comes on the heels of BitGo's $43 million Series B funding round in December.  Kingdom Trust, according to its website, serves over 100,000 clients, focusing on institutional-centered custody services as well as self-directed individual retirement accounts (IRAs).  Speaking to CoinDesk, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe positioned the move as one geared toward a growing interest among institutional clients, with the problem of custody (and regulatory compliance) being at top of mind for some of those eyeing the market.  ""That wall of institutional money cannot hit until that custodianship is met, and this is the first custodian for U.S. folks,"" he said. ""Going forward, as a new type of investors in crypto comes along — which is asset managers and hedge funds — they don't have the technical depth. They have other skills, and we want to bridge that.""  While the business terms of the deal are complete, the sale is still awaiting regulatory approval.  ""All the commercial terms are done,"" Belshe added.  While the terms of the deal are not being disclosed at this time, the acquisition comes after the two companies had worked together for years. Previously, BitGo had provided cold storage for Kingdom Trust's bitcoin, ethereum and other asset holdings, Belshe told CoinDesk. Indeed, both firms had previously partnered with BitcoinIRA to create products around the cryptocurrency.  He also pointed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's move to explain its concerns with possible cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Belshe said the Kingdom Trust acquisition could possibly facilitate the creation of cryptocurrency ETFs given the focus on custody, he said.  To further support this possibility, last month, BitGo added strategic investor and outspoken bitcoin ETF advocate Don Wilson as an advisor.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitGo.

42428473,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8BZh,1516914948,Bitcoin Takes Davos Stage in Currency Panel Debate,"Cryptocurrencies took the stage Thursday at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, with the global elite event featuring a discussion that centered primarily on the question of whether bitcoin is a currency.  The panel, dubbed ""The Crypto-Asset Bubble,"" featured Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor of Sweden's central bank; Jennifer Zhu Scott, Radian Partners principal; Neil Rimer, Index Ventures general partner and co-founder; and Robert Shiller, the Nobel Prize-winning economist. The session was moderated by Yang Yanquing, deputy editor-in-chief of Chinese finance media conglomerate Yicai.  Shiller, who previously said he thought bitcoin was too ambiguous to put a price on, called the cryptocurrency a ""really clever idea"" during the event, but suggested that the tech might be better applied elsewhere.  ""I'm impressed by the technology,"" he remarked. ""And it is spreading in certain quarters, there are certain people who love this. But it seems to me it's technology for something else. It's gone viral as a currency. Blockchain is important, but it's not stable.""  Scott struck a critical tone, calling bitcoin ""a very lousy currency."" Skingsley echoed this sentiment, arguing that a currency needs to have price stability and widespread acceptance in order to be efficient.  She continued:  ""In my view, cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and the others – they don't meet the criteria for money. They can be called an asset but they're not a stable store of value, they fluctuate a lot, and you can't use them as a medium of exchange.""  Index Ventures' Rimer called bitcoin ""one of the most audacious, generous and profound inventions"" that he has ever seen, pointing out that it is only nine years old. He then went on to offer a rebuttal of sorts to the more critical take.  ""We're nine years into this experiment. It's gone well at times and quite poorly. It could fail completely and go to zero, but it has accomplished a number of things I think are remarkable,"" he said during the panel.  Scott later commented on the discussion around price movements – mentioning the rise above $10,000 in particular – as a kind of distraction to the bigger picture involved.  She remarked:  ""The fact that people keep talking today that bitcoin is below 10,000, it's a disaster, or bitcoin is above 10,000 and that's crazy. I think the fact that bitcoin is still alive, and attracting so much attention, the fact that we’re talking about bitcoin in Davos with a Nobel Prize winner, a central bank governor and a seasoned investor, I think that's a powerful tool.""  While the panelists seemed to agree on bitcoin's nature, there was a note of uncertainty about its future between those on the panel.  Scott implied that a stable cryptocurrency in 10 years might look drastically different from bitcoin today, comparing it to discussions about MySpace's success a prior ago. Rimer advocated for more regulation, saying that any truly innovative technology would need to work within existing regulatory frameworks – or at least push against them ""responsibly"" – in order to leave a lasting impact.  The WEF event has thus far featured a range of comments from world leaders on the topic of crypto, including U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

42400937,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLQ41,1516903214,World Leaders Are Talking Crypto at Davos,"World leaders have struck a cautionary tone on cryptocurrencies in statements made during the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland.  From the Prime Minister of the U.K. to the Treasury Secretary of the U.S., the event has seen a number of notable figures make remarks on both cryptocurrencies like bitcoin as well as blockchain technology as a whole. As reported yesterday, notable finance figures including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein have already weighed in on the topic, suggesting that cryptocurrencies are quietly emerging as a major area of discussion at the gathering of the global elite.  For example, Steven Mnuchin, who leads the U.S. Treasury Department, remarked on one panel that ""illicit use"" of cryptocurrencies is a major concern for American regulators.  ""My number-one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they’re not used for illicit activities,"" Mnuchin remarked, according to a report from Reuters.  Similarly, fellow panelist and International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said bitcoin’s anonymity enables the movement of hidden funds.  ""The anonymity and lack of transparency and the way in which it conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism, is just unacceptable. It needs to be taken into account but then there will be innovations coming out of these movements,"" Lagarde, a former finance minister of France, was quoted as saying.  Lagarde predicted that national governments are likely to further regulate cryptocurrencies to prevent these use cases. Perhaps proving Largarde's point, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May told Bloomberg that cryptocurrencies should be looked at due to how they are used ""particularly by criminals.""  Perhaps most significantly, French President Emmanuel Macron called for an international approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, saying ""we need to establish a global contract for global investment.""  Weighing the impact  Others at Davos commented specifically on the exact economic impact of cryptocurrencies today, with comments drawn from finance watchdogs from Asia and Europe, among other areas.  China's securities regulator vice-chairman, Fang Xinghai,  said during a panel that it is unclear what impact bitcoin would have on the economy.  Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz echoed those remarks, adding that he believes there would be little impact on the economy if the cryptocurrency market were to crash.  He went on to caution against investing in cryptocurrencies, saying:  ""When we had the tech wreck, that was a much more widespread exposure. And the fact it barely had [a] perceptible effect on the real economy because it was not a stock market crash but just a segment of the stock market. But it was highly speculative, there was all kinds of bubbles there.""  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, argued in turn that bitcoin has the potential to grow to a point where it would have a more significant impact.  He called for further regulations ""before the amount of outstanding bitcoin becomes large enough to be systemically important to in the global economy,"" predicting that it would reach that point ""soon.""  Bullish on blockchain  Despite their concerns about cryptocurrencies, world leaders and regulators at Davos remarked positively about blockchain as a technology.  Poloz, for example, called it ""a true piece of genius,"" adding that he expects it to be applied to different aspects of the economy.  ""The reason that it has such appeal in the case of bitcoin is it gives you finality of settlement that eventually grinds through the distributed ledger and therefore you trust that,"" he remarked, according to CNBC, on the topic of a central bank-issued digital currency. ""Whereas the central bank, if the Bank of Canada, were to issue a digital currency, well you already trust the Canadian dollar, and so you don't need a distributed ledger in order to believe you just received final payment in your digital wallet.""  Lagarde called the technology ""fascinating,"" noting its censorship-resistant characteristics, among others.  She also suggested that other innovations are likely to emerge from the blockchain space, cautioning that regulators will need to monitor such developments over time, saying during the panel:  ""...there will be new things and innovations coming out of this movement, and we just need to keep them under our watch.""

Speaking in an interview with Channel News Asia, MAS chief fintech officer Sopnendu Mohanty said that he does not foresee a bitcoin price collapse triggering a major financial crash, adding there are indications that global regulators are ""getting serious"" about the cryptocurrency market.  Mohanty said:  ""We know exactly when to intervene, based on the market size and the demand and transaction volume, and we will come in at the right time. So, I'm not overly worried about getting to some large financial system crisis.""  The fintech head further stated that regulators would come forward to apply regulation on consumer protection amidst hype in the digital currency market.  MAS has made several statements on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings in recent months.  In December 2017, citing the recent ""speculative"" escalation in prices across the crypto markets, the monetary authority released a statement advising the public to take ""extreme caution"" if investing in digital currencies.  And the previous month, MAS issued guidance on the application of securities laws when it comes to initial coin offerings (ICOs).  It stated at the time that tokens sold through the ICO model may be considered securities under certain circumstances, according to Singapore's Securities and Futures Act and the Financial Advisers Act.

The bill, which according to public records has a total of 12 sponsors signed on thus far, would exclude ""a developer or seller"" from the applicable securities laws provided they meet certain conditions. Namely, that the token they're offering isn't being offered as an investment and that the token can be exchanged for something – in other words, that it has some kind of utility.  The exemption would also only apply in the event that the seller or developer ""has not entered into a repurchase agreement of any kind or 12 entered into an agreement to locate a buyer for the token.""  Additionally, the Wyoming bill also lays out an exemption from being classified as a broker-dealer in relation to the token, provided that they meet the standards listed above.  Certain parties are excluded from the bill, namely banks and other financial institutions such as credit unions and savings and loan associations.  Past legislative efforts have focused on easing the regulatory environment around uses and development of the tech. In January of last year, for example, lawmakers filed a bill that would make digital currencies a permissible investment for money transmitters.

42400915,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLPnI,1516896041,'Micro' Finance Giant Robinhood Makes Big Bet on Bitcoin,"Stock trading mobile app provider Robinhood is jumping on the crypto-trading bandwagon.  Announced today, the company, which was founded in 2013 as a way to democratize stock trading, said it plans to roll out bitcoin and ether trading services via its mobile apps next month. Not only does the company hope to attract cryptocurrency enthusiasts to its more traditional products, but it's also launching the service to catch some of the momentum cryptocurrency has seen as of late.  ""We've come to understand that cryptocurrencies as an asset have exhibited clear and underlying resiliency and have integrated themselves as part of a diversified and balanced portfolio,"" Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev told CoinDesk.  To start with, the service will only be offered to users in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire, but more states are set to follow.  The company, which is regulated in the U.S. by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra), plans to offer the crypto trading service for free. Plus, it promises instant transfers on cryptocurrency purchases for amounts of $1,000 or less, a significant improvement on the time it generally takes for people to buy cryptocurrency for the first time.  Tenev explained:  ""We view entering crypto as a way to extend our user base and build our brand.""  Crypto meets stock  While offering the service for free could seem risky, Tenev said, the company hopes to attract investors from the $550 billion cryptocurrency industry to the platform and its products, which already provide revenue streams.  Specifically, the firm charges for a premium service called Robinhood Gold that enables margin trading and after-hours trading. The company also generates revenue by collecting interest on cash and securities in user accounts similar to a traditional bank.  Having raised a total of $176 million in venture capital, the crypto functionality is in line with Robinhood's push to add more products to its offering. Last month, the firm rolled out options trading and a month earlier, it added a web-based platform to its mobile services.  But the move isn't just about luring cryptocurrency enthusiasts to its traditional products, it's also about giving users normally focused on traditional investment vehicles exposure to cryptocurrency.  According to Tenev, the firm recently crossed 3 million accounts and $100 billion in total transacted volume.  Speaking to the company's interest in bringing together traditional assets with nascent crypto assets, Tenev said:  ""We envision a world where people can have your cryptos alongside your stocks, ETFs, and more.""  Robinhood has not built its own cryptocurrency wallet, but will be using a third-party provider. While Robinhood will manage custody of the cryptocurrencies on the user’s behalf, Tenev said the company does not intend to make investments with the cryptocurrency its customers store.  Coins to come  While Robinhood customers will only have access to bitcoin and ethereum trading, effective immediately, the company will let customers add 16 different cryptocurrencies (bitcoin and ethereum included) to their ""watchlist,"" a feature allowing them to monitor market data, read related news and create price alerts.  Other coins that can be added to the watchlist are bitcoin cash, litecoin, XRP (Ripple), ethereum classic, zcash, monero, dash, stellar, qtum, bitcoin gold, omisego, NEO, lisk, and dogecoin.  For now, Tenev isn't revealing any possible plans to start trading those other currencies, however, he said that a ""listing committee"" had been established to analyze factors such as security, functionality and demand to assess cryptocurrencies that could be added to the trading functionality or the market data list.  And, while the company is interested in adding new cryptocurrencies to its trading platform, Tenev said Robinhood would not be adding more complicated asset classes tied to crypto, such as bitcoin or ethereum futures.  He said:  ""We're focused right now on the coins themselves, and I think in the near future we anticipate adding a variety of other coins before we extend to new asset classes.""

Mobius announced Thursday that it has raised $39 million in the ICO — one of the larger recent token sales and the largest by far on the Stellar platform. The company accepted only Stellar's native currency, lumens (XLM), in exchange for its own token, known as mobi.  According to Mobius, the sale hit its $39 million hard cap after only two hours, selling 35 percent of the total 888 million mobi tokens.  Participants in the round included China's Angel Chain Capital, Nirvana Capital and WaltonChain, an internet of things (IoT) startup that is building devices to enable manufacturers and retailers to track supply chains, according to the firm's website.  In addition to this backing, Gobaud emphasized that Mobius deployed its decentralized app (dapp) store alongside its ICO, saying it was important for the company to come out with live code early, to prove the project was real.  But what's perhaps most striking about the sale was the choice of blockchain.  While latency or cost might not be a dealbreaker for some blockchain projects, they are for Mobius' use case. Its thesis is that traditional tech companies will soon want to integrate with cryptocurrencies and, eventually, a decentralized web.  Mobius' white paper compares the company's work to that of Stripe, the Silicon Valley darling that took integration of credit card payments down to a few lines of code (and incubated Stellar in its early days). Mobius aims to do the same thing for cryptocurrency payments and, down the line, for publishing data to trade on decentralized marketplaces.  So the company needed an IoT-friendly network that could handle large amounts of transactions and data quickly, with low or no fees.  The goal is to ""make it easy to connect every device, developer and data stream to the blockchain ecosystem,"" Gobaud said.  Yet while the vast majority of ICO-funded projects have been run on top of ethereum, using the ERC-20 standard, that blockchain has suffered from transaction backlogs and pendulum-like swings in fees.  Hence, after beginning its project on ethereum, Mobius switched to Stellar, the protocol created by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb. Like Ripple before it, Stellar was designed specifically for frictionless payments.  Trade-offs  Ethereum's scaling challenges have become acute in recent months. The issue moved Kik to announce that it would move its kin token off ethereum in December 2017.  While the ethereum developers recognize and are working on the problem, the Mobius team couldn't wait for a scaling solution, Gobaud said.  ""We were building our dapp store on ethereum and then we connected with Jed,"" he said adding:  ""We realized there was no way that ethereum could handle our technology. It was too slow, too expensive and too insecure. ... We see all these other projects with these immense problems""  Gobaud highlighted the problems with safely deploying smart contracts. ""They are Turing complete programs, but they are really hard to write,"" he said, pointing to the first and second multi-million-dollar ether losses on Parity. Solidity was not a language built with security in mind, Gobaud argued.  In Stellar, ""we think we've uncovered this underutilized, really unknown technology,"" Gobaud said.  For example, Stellar supports multi-signature wallets at the protocol level, making custodianship much easier for developers.  But Stellar has its downsides, Gobaud acknowledged. It's not Turing complete, for example, but Mobius is happy to make that trade-off in exchange for vastly faster and cheaper transactions.  What's next?  The white paper discusses a lot of use cases for the mobi token and its protocol, but the easiest one to explain is payments.  For anyone who believes that cryptocurrency will become more and more appealing to online businesses, the company that makes transacting in crypto easy the fastest stands to recoup benefits with a long tail.  If Mobius can make accepting crypto payments a matter of adding a few lines of code, that would be compelling if online companies begin accepting cryptocurrency more widely.  Talking to Gobaud, though, payments seems more like a way to sell the traditional internet on blockchain integration.  He's most excited about the market that will come when firms start posting their data to decentralized marketplaces, selling it via secure, live auctions he calls the ""NASDAQ for data.""  Gobaud said:  ""More advanced or technical users are really excited about the data marketplace because they are aware that getting data into blockchain ecosystem is really complicated.""  Data generated on blockchain protocols is easy to verify because they are closed environments. But data from the real world can't be verified on a blockchain without help.  That's why Mobius is building a proof-of-stake oracle system, so that data streams with data from the real world can build up reputations as reliable sources over time. With the system, to put its data up for sale on the market, a company would have to prove it holds a certain amount of tokens.  If that marketplace catches on, the cost of staking should be more than paid for by revenue from selling data over time. This could be anything from data about road conditions from a smart vehicle or local weather from a sensor on top of a commercial building.  To reach the point where the decentralized web has a rich enough ecosystem to support these marketplaces, the team is also working to solve other small problems faced by developers on the way there. For example, it built a universal login protocol, where a website can verify that a device holds a token to let its user log on to a service.  Some sites might want to take this a step further and use tokens to integrate the level of access someone has to a site. So, on a platform like Reddit, a user might only need one token, while a moderator might need a few tokens to log in with more advanced permissions.  In the meantime, developers are already building dapps for Mobius' store, but it's small scale offerings so far, little video games or prediction games. That's work at the experimental level, but Gobaud said he's encouraged by the fact that people already want to work with it. The websites on Geocities were crude, too, but they were a stepping stone to the web we know today.  He concluded:  ""It's like the early days of the internet.""

On Wednesday, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price index (BPI) closed (as per UTC) 5.15 percent higher at $11,399. The positive close above $11,000 adds credence to the solid defense of the $10,000 mark seen earlier this week.  That said, the follow-through is not necessarily encouraging.  The BPI clocked a high of $11,711 at 03:59 UTC today before falling back below $11,200. As of writing, the BPI stands at $11,350. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 3 percent in the last 24 hours, says data source OnChainFX.  Bitcoin chart - Bull reversal confirmed  A bullish doji reversal occurs when a doji candle (as seen on Tuesday) is followed by a positive price action (yesterday's 5 percent gain).  So, the short-term outlook is bullish. Still, there is merit in being cautious.  Comments on social media indicate the investor community is not convinced by previous day's bullish price action and wants to see a sustained move above $11,500 before calling a bottom. The argument has substance says the chart below.  4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows-  Bitcoin witnessed a solid recovery on Jan. 17 from the low of $9,005 on the back of strong volumes.  However, volumes have dropped in the subsequent days. This could be the reason behind bitcoin's failure to rise above the falling trendline hurdle on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21.  BTC has had another go at the trendline resistance today, but once again volumes remain low.  Higher lows as represented by the rising trendline.  View  Bullish doji reversal was confirmed yesterday, but so far bitcoin has been unable to generate the follow throughnecessary to declare that the bottoming process is complete.  Only a high volume break above the trendline resistance on the 4-hour chart would add credence to the bullish doji reversal and open doors for a sustained move higher to $13,000 and $14,250.  On the other hand, rejection at the falling trendline followed by a high volume drop below $10,300 (rising trendline support on the 4 - hour chart) could yield re-test of last week's low of $9,005.  That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below $10,391.02 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to 2017 high) would revive the bearish outlook.

In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published yesterday, both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ands the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) voiced that they are devoting a significant portion of resources to monitoring the industry. And along with other authorities, they will continue to stamp down on fraudulent activities in the market.  The article was co-written by Jay Clayton and J. Christopher Giancarlo – chairs of the SEC and CFTC, respectively – and is the latest public statement from the financial regulators indicating the increasingly strident efforts being made to oversee the industry.  In July last year, the SEC issued the notable announcement that the agency may consider tokens issued during initial coin offerings (ICO) as securities that must be registered with the agency.  Yet, in the WSJ piece, Clayton and Giancarlo warned those who might try and circumvent the guidance, saying:  ""The SEC is devoting a significant portion of its resources to the ICO market ... Market participants, including lawyers, trading venues and financial services firms, should be aware that we are disturbed by many examples of form being elevated over substance, with form-based arguments depriving investors of mandatory protections.""  Further, cryptocurrencies are now being ""promoted, pursued and traded as investment assets,"" while their much-touted utility as an efficient medium of exchange now a ""distant secondary characteristic,"" they added.  The comments are also in line with recent moves by the SEC in halting ICO activities and filing charges against their organizers. Just last week, the CFTC, which treats cryptocurrencies as commodities, has also notably brought up legal cases to sue allegedly fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes.  In addition, Clayton and Giancarlo also voiced support in the article for policies that seek to review existing laws to ensure they can efficiently regulate activities pertaining to cryptocurrency.  ""Many of the internet-based cryptocurrency-trading platforms have registered as payment services and are not subject to direct oversight by the SEC or the CFTC.

42400920,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLPrE,1516871717,Investors File Class Action Against BitConnect After Closure,"Just a week after the abrupt closure of BitConnect's lending and exchange platform, investors are seeking legal action to claim back their funds, according to public document.  The class action case (see below), filed with the Southern District Court of Florida on Jan. 24, alleges that BitConnect issued cryptocurrency tokens that were effectively unregistered securities and gathered additional funds as a ""wide-ranging Ponzi scheme."" The lawsuit was filed by David Silver from the Florida-based law firm Silver Miller, which has filed suits on behalf of cryptocurrency consumers including those seeking damages against mining company Giga Watt.  In light of the recent closure of BitConnect after receiving two cease-and-desist orders by U.S. state regulators, the plaintiffs are seeking to claim back the investments they put into the company.  The document states that BitConnect launched several projects, such as a lending program that required investors to send in cryptocurrencies to purchase BitConnect Coin, a token generated by the company's platform.  BitConnect then allegedly promised investors that its proprietary trading platform would use the funds to generate a monthly return of 40 percent or a daily compound rate at 1 percent, which could amount to 3,000 percent annually.  As such, the plaintiffs argue that BitConnect violated the Securities Act by issuing unregistered securities. The document further points to a statement claimed to be taken from BitConnect's website:  ""This investment option involves profiting from BitConnect trading bot and volatility software. You will receive daily profit based on your investment options. Upon investment term completion, you will receive your capital back to take out from the BitConnect lending platform or optionally reinvest back in lending platform to continue receiving daily profits.""  Yet the plaintiffs further allege that, instead of genuinely using the funds for cryptocurrency trading, BitConnect operated as a Ponzi scheme and took funds from additional investors to realize the promise for existing investors.  According to the document, six individuals filed the case on behalf of all investors and account holders who have transferred funds – both cryptocurrencies and fiat – to BitConnect for investment. While it's unclear based on the document how much in assets the whole class put in, the six named individuals said their loss totaled $771,000.  As reported previously, BitConnect's closure came after two cease-and-desist orders from the Texas and North Carolina securities regulators, which subsequently led to a 90 percent plunge in the price of its BitConnect Coin, which is traded on several cryptocurrency exchanges.  At press time, BitConnect had not responded to a CoinDesk email request for comment.

42400913,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLPmJ,1516869031,Ex-CFTC Commissioner Joins Crypto Exchange as Adviser,"Bart Chilton, the former commissioner of the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is doubling down on his stated desire for a regulated market to foster the development of cryptocurrency trading.  The former U.S. government regulator announced on Jan. 23 that he will join the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Omega One as an adviser, focusing on regulatory aspects in the U.S. and abroad as the exchange eyes attracting retail and institutional investors.  In an email response to CoinDesk, Chilton explained that one of the reasons he signed up for the new role is because the team at Omega One also shares the belief that appropriate regulation should be in place to facilitate the growth of cryptocurrency trading.  ""We [Alex Gordon-Brandor, CEO of Omega One, and Chilton] spoke for a while and [Gordon-Brandor] explained how Omega One wanted to break the mold of most in the digital world of staying away from all things regulatory or government like a hot oven. He said we need transparency and disclosure and to abide by appropriate rules,"" Chilton explained.  In addition to advising on regulatory issues, Chilton said he is keen on potential involvement in the Brooklyn Project, a cross-industry regulatory endeavor for the crypto space launched by blockchain tech firm ConsenSys, which is also a partner of the Omega One.  The news marks a notable move by a former government regulator to take part in shaping the development of cryptocurrency trading by taking his previous experience in pushing through regulations to the emerging industry.  Serving at the CFTC from 2007 to 2014, Chilton held a powerful position in enforcing market regulation and implementing position limits in bid to protect investor benefits. He also openly opposed the legislative delay of the Dodd-Frank act, which was enacted for investor protection in response to the 2008 financial crisis.  Previously, Chilton has made comments arguing that, while the U.S. should embrace the potential of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, he believes proper regulations are needed for a sustainable growth of the industry, especially when it comes to protecting investors. Another issue that regulation may solve, as he has suggested, is the notorious volatility of bitcoin's price.
