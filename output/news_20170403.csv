42379383,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fOL,1491258430,Bitcoin Exchange Bitfinex Buys Back All Remaining 'Hack Credit' Tokens,"Digital currency exchange Bitfinex today announced it has bought back all of the remaining cryptographic tokens it used to reimburse investors who lost funds in its August 2016 hack.  Citing increased equity conversions and strong operating results, Bitfinex reduced its internal reserves to purchase the remaining tokens at their $1 face value, and moved to shut down the markets associated with them.  At press time, officials at the exchange said all so-called 'BFX tokens' have been destroyed, and that investors have been reimbursed with US dollars.  The redemption occurred today beginning at 20:00:00 UTC, with fund requests settling within 45 minutes. During that time, trading of the BFX token was halted and all margin positions were liquidated.  The move follows the August 2016 hack of the exchange, in which investors were given a 36% haircut to compensate for a hack that drained 120,000 BTC from the exchange’s reserves. The BFX tokens thus represented an equity obligation to return the 36% back to platform users sometime in the future.  Notably, this isn't the first internal BFX buyback orchestrated by Bitfinex, as the exchange purchased 1% of the tokens in September 2016.  The $1 face value tokens had traded between $0.49 and $0.65 for most of 2016, surrounded by doubts that the exchange would never be able to recoup the nearly $72m in value lost following the security breach. That price increased to $0.89 by 1 March 2017 following a strong period of heavy trading volume in the cryptocurrency markets.  The announcement posted on the company's webpage expressed gratitude for the patience of the community and continued support.  Bitfinex wrote:  ""We are tremendously grateful to all of our customers and new shareholders for helping us get to this point.""  As of 21:00:00 UTC, CoinDesk has confirmed BFX tokens are being redeemed at the stated $1 face value.

42379385,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fQr,1491245722,Litecoin Sees Spike in Support for Scaling Solution SegWit,"A scaling solution originally developed for the bitcoin blockchain may soon get its first trial run on litecoin.  The percentage of the litecoin network signaling to enact the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade reached record highs today according to Litecoinblockhalf.com, climbing to 58.33% of nodes and miners operating the software.  The figures mark a notable jump from last week when only around 25% of devices keeping track of the network's history were signaling for activation. Much of the increase comes from large mining pool F2Pool's decision to signal.  According to Litecoinpool.org, F2Pool currently produces over one-third of the hashing power behind the litecoin network.  While the figure marks an impressive uptick, SegWit still requires 75% of the network agree to adopt the proposal, a figure that is 20% below bitcoin's required 95% threshhold. Because of this differential, many view litecoin as a potential ""sandbox"" for discovering potential bugs and vulnerabilities possibly hidden in the nascent software.  Originally proposed in December 2015, SegWit sought to boost the bitcoin blockchain's transaction capacity by cleverly altering how data was stored by the network. Still, it has become mired in controversy, as a small group of vocal bitcoin users have pushed for alternative solutions.

42379393,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fZf,1491241211,Developer Proposes Hybrid SegWit Solution to Bitcoin's Block Size Debate,"A new proposal submitted to the Bitcoin Core developer list this weekend has proposed an alternative solution to bitcoin's long-simmering scaling debate.  Proposed by developer Sergio Lerner, ""Segwit2MB"" seeks to combine Segregated Witness, the proposal put forward by Bitcoin Core, the network's volunteer developer team, and an increase of the block size to 2 MB, first outlined in BIP 102.  The proposal would still require 95% miner support to enact SegWit, though the proposal would begin a countdown to a network-wide backwards incompatible block size change on 14th December, 2017. (The block size hard fork would only occur if SegWit were to reach the consensus threshold and be activated).  Following a brief comment period, Lerner plans to formally add the Segwit2mb to the Bitcoin Core Github page as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP).  The patch currently being proposed would modify the existing 120 lines of code comprising Bitcoin Core and add an additional 220 lines of testing code. However, this is subject to change following the comment period.  Lerner’s hypothesis is that by appeasing both sides of the scaling debate that consensus will be reached more quickly, ultimately settling a conflict that has drawn on for years.  He wrote:  ""Segwit2Mb is the project to merge into Bitcoin a minimal patch that aims to, untangle the current conflict between different political positions regarding segwit activation vs. an increase of the on-chain blockchain space through a standard block size increase. It is not a new solution, but it should be seen more as a least common denominator.""

42379392,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fYP,1491227990,'Confidential Assets': Blockstream Reveals New Bitcoin Privacy Tech,"Bitcoin startup Blockstream has unveiled new technology for shielding data on a blockchain.  Expanding on an old technique used to hide transaction amounts, the company has developed a new scheme dubbed 'confidential assets' to conceal the types of assets in a transaction. Revealing just how the tech works, the startup has released a new paper today, co-authored by Blockstream developers Andrew Poelstra, Adam Back, Mark Friedenbach, Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.  Using confidential assets, viewers of a blockchain would be able to see a transaction's senders and receivers, but not what kind of asset is traded – whether bitcoin, stocks, gold, or something else.  So why is hiding asset types important?  Banks have made it known that they aren't thrilled that blockchains make certain information public, and have been increasingly exploring various ways of making their holdings private while still taking advantage of the ability to share the database of transactions with others.  Against that backdrop, Blockstream CEO Adam Back framed confidential assets as a technology to help enterprises overcome what he called this ""awkward tradeoff"".  Tokyo-based marketing company Digital Garage has been revealed as the first partner to use the new tech, as a part of Blockstream's Elements sidechains initiative, with plans to use it to shield loyalty points.  Blockstream core tech engineer Greg Sanders described confidentiality as a ""key requirement"" for Digital Garage, as well as other companies using blockchain tech.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The companies care a lot about their privacy. You don't want that [transaction data] out in the open because it's basically showing your books to everyone. Confidential assets allows companies to move these assets on a publicly verifiable blockchain, but hide the amounts and the types of assets being moved around at the same time.""  However, the tech is not yet being used in a production setting.  Verifiable but private  Blockstream has been exploring the enterprise blockchain world over the past couple of years, including joining the Hyperledger consortium and deploying private blockchains on top of bitcoin.  It's also been testing privacy features on Elements sidechains, including using ‘ confidential transactionshttps://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt’ – a technique first proposed by Back – to shield transaction amounts from non-participants in the system.  In a nutshell, the system uses cryptography to prove that people are getting their money, even while the details aren’t revealed to everyone. Yet anyone, including nodes, can verify that the transaction is valid.  Confidential assets extends this concept to shield multiple assets.  However, there is a downside of both confidential transactions and confidential assets – they require much more space on the blockchain than standard transactions.  Boon to privacy  Confidential assets is currently being tested on a Blockstream Elements sidechain, though it can potentially be ported elsewhere.  According to Back, though, while the system works on a sidechain, it's is not suitable for bitcoin proper, since the digital currency's code doesn’t support other asset types.  However, some other projects now use confidential transactions, including MimbleWimble and the privacy project ValueShuffle. And if developers of such projects chose to, they could effectively upgrade to support confidential assets instead.  In conclusion, Back described the new technology as a part of a larger push for adoption of bitcoin and blockchain technology, saying:  ""And to the extent that confidentiality would be an impediment to companies adopting the technology, and just user privacy rights as well, it’s important that we be able to provide confidentiality so that the industry can adopt blockchain technology and start deploying the advantages without being held back by confidentiality concerns.""

42379399,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87feh,1491224119,Bitmain Subsidiary Opens New Bitcoin Mining Pool to Public,"An R&D division of mining giant Bitmain has launched a new pool.  Having mined its first block as part of a closed beta three months ago, BitmainTech Israel Ltd is now opening its ConnectBTC pool to global bitcoin miners, inviting them to run the software as a way to combine resources with other miners and better compete for bitcoin's rewards.  ConnectBTC manager Gadi Glikberg explained that the pool was written from scratch by a team independent from Bitmain's signature AntPool operation – a mining pool that's currently the leader in combined hashing power, according to data from Blockchain.  ""We believe in this manner we can make sure we serve the mining community with the best possible products,"" Gilkberg said.  Notably, ConnectBTC appears to be operating slightly out of step with its parent company, which has been one of the more vocal proponents of the idea network participants should run alternative software versions that would expand the size of the transactions blocks it can process.  ConnectBTC, Glikberg said, is running the Bitcoin Core client, and noted that it's ""not signaling"" for either an upgrade to SegWit (the Core development team's preferred solution) or Bitcoin Unlimited (an alternative software Bitmain has said it intends to support).  Such public remarks have recently seen Bitmain reignite the long-standing debate on how bitcoin will increase its transaction capacity, while boosting concerns the network could potentially split into two competing blockchain networks.  Bitmain declined to offer additional comment.

42379400,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fiT,1491222629,Managed Fund Titans Eye 2018 for Blockchain MVP Launch,"An international consortium of asset managers is working to bring 401k plans, mutual funds and pension funds to the blockchain.  After rolling out a smart transfer agent proof of concept (PoC) in December, Fundchain, a group led by Luxembourg-based startup Scorechain, aims to have a distributed ledger-based product ready to bring to market next year.  Participating in the consortium are BNP Paribas, HSBC, ING Luxembourg, RBC Investor & Treasury Services, Société Générale, PwC Luxembourg, European Fund Administration and the University of Luxembourg, among others.  Smart transfer agent aside, the group is now exploring how blockchain tech could simplify know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance to improve business processes and integrate digital assets into a new share class.  ""Sometimes you have to wait two to three days for a transaction to clear. If you want to transfer shares to investors, it could take as long as two to three weeks,"" said Pierre Gerard, chief executive of Scorechain.  Gerard further pointed to extensive use of intermediaries in the industry – including investors, servicers, asset managers, auditors and regulators – as evidence for the potential benefits of moving services to a blockchain.  Gerard said:  ""There are pain points in data management and in the exchange of information that maybe could be solved with blockchain.""  Fundchain is now examining four potential use cases it has identified, and it aims to select one in the coming months with the goal of putting forth a minimum viable product by the end of 2017.  Whether it's a true ""blockchain"" or a distributed ledger service, Gerard said is still unclear, though an initial version is built on the ethereum platform.  No 'big bang'  With the news, Fundchain has also published a white paper that details the group's broader vision for how blockchains can be incorporated into the fund-distribution value chain.  Notably, Gerard said that Fundchain's goal is not to unleash a ""big bang"" on the managed funds industry, but rather to identify incremental instances where blockchain can bring value.  ""Fundchain won't solve all of asset management's problems with the blockchain, but we'll try to be our brick in the wall,"" he said. ""We want to focus on something that is doable.""  After launching an analytics platform designed to assist in managing digital assets, Gerard and Scorechain sought to make further inroads into asset management by courting Luxembourg's industry giants in 2016.  Luxembourg has established itself as the second-largest hub for investment funds in the world behind the US through its favorable tax and regulatory environment and heavy concentration of human capital in asset management.  Roughly 80% of all funds sold in Europe are issued in Luxembourg.  In the new white paper provided exclusively to CoinDesk, Fundchain identifies four ongoing trends in the industry, seeing changes in demographics, technology, environment and social values.  The document identifies areas of focus and potential disruption within the industry, such as decentralized identification; the use of single fund or multi-asset wallets to simplify account management; decentralized digital settlement; and real-time reporting and reconciliation.  The paper notes:  ""In the new business model based on blockchain, the investor has access to the fund through their respective blockchain. Once furnished with a digital identity, they are able to subscribe without the need for an intermediary, simply by using the associated smart contract and blockchain.""  Reimagining fund management  Another key component of blockchain's value proposition is the ability to greatly reduce settlement risk.  However, because asset management is a highly-regulated industry that spans multiple jurisdictions, governments and self-regulatory bodies, the white paper emphasizes that these agencies must be kept informed throughout the building process.  ""An approach adopted in parallel to showcase the efficiency of the use of blockchain will probably be a necessary step to convince the regulator and the different players about the necessary changes, reliability and cost efficiency of the solution for the various players,"" it argues.  In interview, Gerard positioned the solution in context with other concerns that might make implementing blockchain in fund management more complicated than in other sectors.  ""As long as assets are not really on the blockchain, it would be quite complicated to [entirely] manage a fund with the blockchain,"" he said. ""And we are dealing with many fiat currencies – it's quite complicated.""  Notwithstanding, he lauded the democratizing effect that blockchain could bring to the sector, and said:  ""If we can reduce or simplify the processes so people can invest smaller amounts and in new types of assets, in this case it would be a true revolution on both sides – allowing you to invest in new types of assets and reach new investor.""

42379390,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fVt,1491219030,Broadridge is Building a Global Blockchain for Stockholder Voting,"As 'proxy season' approaches, public companies around the world are preparing to send out countless measures to stock holders who, by casting votes, will determine the future direction for each company.  Using an array of proxy voting technologies, stockholders around the world will be asked to cast billions of votes for measures impacting board membership, executive salaries and more.  However, this could be one of the last seasons ever during which that process is done without the assistance of blockchain technology – that's if one of the largest proxy-voting platforms in the world has anything to say about it.  With a proxy voting infrastructure that underpins the vast majority of voting based on share ownership around the world, New York-based Broadridge has revealed to CoinDesk it is now building two separate solutions that could move those transactions to a blockchain.  In conversation with CoinDesk, the company's global head of corporate strategy and US fixed income, Vijay Mayadas, detailed how the company that last year generated $2.9bn in revenue is working to slowly move that work to a blockchain.  ""We do global proxy across the world,"" Mayadas told CoinDesk. ""So we are in somewhat of a unique position to understand the requirements and build a blockchain solution to meet those requirements.""  Last quarter alone, Broadridge generated $710m, about a 50% increase resulting largely from an acquisition. Similarly, recurring fee revenues hit $334m last quarter, also helped in part by multiple proxy-related acquisitions.  Without those acquisitions, though, revenue would likely have looked a bit different. The revenue from a single acquisition accounted for more than the total of company's overall growth, while multiple other acquisitions contributed to the recurring fee growth.  Without the acquisitions, event-driven revenues actually declined by $27m, believed to be a result of lower mutual fund proxy volumes, while organic revenue growth was up 4% last quarter.  Multiple projects  To increase margins, the global head of strategy is helping build blockchain voting solutions in two main categories, with multiple other blockchain projects also revealed exclusively to CoinDesk.  The largest of the projects is a global blockchain solution for proxy voting, where stockholders are allowed to cast a wide range of votes.  The global blockchain pilot, expected to be unveiled soon, will consist of real votes cast between a ""very large"" bank and two large custodians, according to Mayadas. To integrate the product with stock holders’ ownership stakes, the blockchain solution will tap into pertinent global custodians who keep a record of ownership.  As more and more of Broadridge's two billion messages to investors each year are moved to the blockchain, additional custodians will need to be added, but the global structure will remain largely the same.  That's not the case with Broadridge's other proxy solution, though. Currently in development for the US, that system is completely different from a design perspective, and is planned for integration with 900 broker-dealers instead of the firm's global custodians.  Mayadas said:  ""The process is very different, the regulations are very different, so there are a lot of nuances around the proxy process.""  Asia-Pacific focus  Over the past five months, since Broadridge spent $90m to acquire blockchain-related assets from Georgia-based Inveshare, the company’s related work has expanded in more than just the variety of proxy solutions.  From a team of 30 people previously working on blockchain development, 10 more have been added, and the lessons they’ve learned along the way are now being applied to applications beyond just proxy voting.  Specifically, Mayadas said Broadridge has recently begun to focus on the clearing and settlement space surrounding fixed-income investment vehicles and more.  ""We are probably 50% focused on proxy, 50% focused on a bunch of other use cases,"" he said.  With 18 of the 23 primary dealers in the US listed as clients, Mayadas estimates his firm now owns a 60% market share in the space.  To help gather critical mass among those clients and more, the company earlier this year embarked on a roadshow in the Asia-Pacific region with members of the Singapore Stock Exchange, the Singapore Monetary Authority and the Japan Exchange Group.  Broadridge has identified that region as central to its growth strategy due to the integrated nature of the local infrastructure – a factor the firm thinks could help clients more rapidly adopt the technology.  Because those clients are already united under Broadridge’s own set of processes and standards, Mayadas argued they will have an advantage over others pursuing the consortium model.  He said:  ""One of the challenges we’ve seen with folks like R3 and so on, is trying to get everyone to agree on a standard when you’re building something from scratch.""  Application layer  Another change Broadridge has experienced since last year is of a more philosophical nature.  Gone are the days of imagining a wholesale replacement of financial infrastructure with blockchain systems, as more and more of Broadridge’s clients have struggled to see the business case for doing so.  Still suffering from the fallout surrounding the financial collapse of 2008, Mayadas says his clients are looking to quickly save money on even the tightest margins, and they believe blockchain could help.  But as major players like Nasdaq and South Africa’s Central Securities Depository, Strate, have also begun working on proxy blockchain solutions and more, the race to monetize the technology has accelerated.  Now, Broadridge’s clients have targeted a return on their investment in as little as two to three years, not the 15 years Mayadas predicts it will take for the majority of the world’s “core” financial infrastructure to be built on blockchain.  To accelerate the path to profitability, Broadridge has tweaked its strategy from ground-up disruption to the construction of a ""thin layer"" of blockchain applications, as Mayadas describes them.  Instead of seeking the larger scale benefits of the wholesale movement of transactions to a blockchain, these applications are designed to sit atop the existing infrastructure and squeeze out increased efficiencies in the short term.  While running in parallel to the existing system, these hybrid blockchain applications will, the firm theorizes, result in dividends as kinks in the larger blockchain system are worked out and resiliency is tested.  Planned integration  Perhaps the most dramatic example of this new change, is an early stage prototype being constructed by Broadridge to accelerate the settlement time of corporate bonds, although without utilizing blockchain in the process.  Instead, such a solution would be built with eventual blockchain integration in mind.  While technical details of the solutions are not yet being revealed, one of Broadridge’s largest clients is founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, JP Morgan. Further, Broadridge is an investor in Digital Asset Holdings and a member of Linux-led Hyperledger group.  For now, Mayadas believes that, in the short term, the increased efficiency his clients need can be achieved using more traditional database technology than a blockchain.  He concluded:  ""We actually think we can do that without blockchain. But we think over time blockchain can help us even more.""

42379386,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87fS7,1491211804,Blockchain's Trust Paradox,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom newsletter delivered every Sunday to our subscribers.  A Nordic country known for its friendliness and stoicism may be about to show us the importance of trust.  This week, Sweden's land registry, together with a group of private companies, announced a pilot to put land titles on a blockchain was moving into a new phase. After months of testing, the initiative will now focus on integrating the tech into bank processes.  While this may seem like an obvious non-financial application for blockchain (given the paper-intensive, slow and complex process of most property transactions), its rollout won't be easy, especially in geographical areas where it is most needed.  Why? It comes down to trust.  For a government to migrate something as fundamental as property rights to a new platform based on an unfamiliar technology, it will need to count on the support of the people and institutions it is designed to benefit.  Without a high level of confidence in the government’s motives and competence, the project will encounter resistance, especially given the value involved, the risk if it goes wrong and the comfortable familiarity with the existing (albeit clunky) system.  New measurements  Coincidentally, this week also saw the publication of the OECD’s trust barometer, which tracks the evolution of the degree to which citizens trust their government.  As expected, trust is declining in most countries.  Sweden, however, held steady at a relatively high level (56%), news that bodes well for public acceptance of the new platform, and should help the country set a good example for others to follow.  The Republic of Georgia is in a similar situation.  Earlier this year, it revealed that it was increasing the scope of a trial aimed at registering land titles and recording transactions on a blockchain platform.  The country does not make it onto the OECD barometer, but the World Bank indicates it is a relatively trusted place to do business.  Trust paradox  Yet even in countries with 'reliable' governments, implementation will not be easy, especially when it requires the buy-in of a wide spectrum of private institutions.  One of the banks participating in the next phase of Sweden’s land registry trial has already said that they have no plans to implement the platform – it is participating just to learn more about the tech. However, with time, testing and communication, organizations in Sweden and Georgia should be able to gradually roll out blockchain land registries.  The positive impact on the economy could inspire other implementations, at home and elsewhere.  Yet most other countries have higher barriers, according to the OECD trust barometer. A lack of confidence in official institutions will weaken the acceptance of any change they propose.  Unfortunately, it is precisely those countries that could most benefit from a more transparent and tamper-proof land registry system.  The irony does not stop there. An even greater and often overlooked paradox is this: you need to start with a high level of trust before you can implement a system that makes it unnecessary.

42379379,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87cE5,1491203200,"Bitcoin Rebounds As Price Tops $1,100","Bitcoin prices have surged today, rising over 3% overall since the start of trading and at one stage topping $1,141.  At the time of reporting, the price of a bitcoin had fallen slightly to around $1,134, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, though the general trend seems to be still rising.  The sudden increase comes after a fall in prices following the rejection by the SEC of the Winklevoss brothers' bitcoin ETF last month.  Bitcoin had been trading at record highs last month in expectation of the announcement, at one stage closing on $1,300 per coin, and surpassing even the per-spot price for an ounce of gold – truly justifying bitcoin's moniker 'digital gold' for the second time in its history.  Further, there has been debate in the industry over the path forward for bitcoin and how best to scale the technology going forward. That discussion has led to talk of a 'hard fork' of the core software – a possibility that could split the digital currency into two rival coins.  Fears over the issue seemed to have hit prices late last month, as bitcoin once again exchanged hands at sub-$1,000 prices mid-to-late March.  While it's never easy to directly link events in the real world to movements on the price charts, it would seem that bitcoin traders are shrugging off concerns over the scaling issue and still seeing the core value in the cryptocurrency.
