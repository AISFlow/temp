42426231,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGEbh,1420395268,Review: Ravenbit Keeps Physical Bitcoin Meme Alive,"Name: Ravenbit NODE coin (standard edition, brass)  What it is: A physical 'bitcoin' token that can be loaded with value or kept as a collectors' item.  Made by: Ravenbit.  Cost: $20 plus shipping (less if bought in bulk quantities, more if limited edition).  Basic summary: The Ravenbit NODE is a physical bitcoin token with no pre-loaded value (to comply with money transmission regulations), to give as gifts or keep as a collectors' item. Users install bitcoin value by attaching printed QR codes, and as such the coins are re-usable.  CoinDesk rating: 3.5/5  Using the device  Pros  Cons  Competitors  Conclusion  The basics  Composition: 85% copper  Color: Gold  Diameter: 39mm  Thickness: ~2.5mm  Weight: 0.95oz  Inside the package from Ravenbit is the coin itself, in an airtight round plastic coin case and a felt pouch with the Ravenbit logo, two hologram stickers to seal the QR codes in, a Ravenbit sticker and a clear acrylic display stand.  The obverse side of the coin features a 'nodes' motif consisting of one large bitcoin 'B' logo in the center surrounded by 25 smaller interconnecting logos. Some of them are tiny, and the level of detail is such that examining even the smallest ones with a magnifying glass reveals accurate lines.  The reverse is mainly blank with an indented square to hold printed QR codes. Around the rim are the words 'bitcoin', 'Ravenbit', four raven logos and a braid pattern, plus the minting year. The edge of the coin is dead smooth, without reeding or lettering.  Using the device  Ravenbit's site has instructions on how to add actual bitcoin value to the coin.  Here's where the process gets fiddly. To actually use your Ravenbit coin as a cold wallet you'll have to print both your public and private keys as 0.55-inch (14mm) wide squares onto paper, cut them out and attach them to the coin somehow.  Ravenbit actually has a client-side javascript (i.e. works offline) generator on its site to produce the codes at the exact size required (something I discovered only after about five minutes messing around with photocopier reduction, which was unadvisable and entirely my fault).  At those sizes, the higher-resolution printer the better, but I was able to produce codes that scanned easily even with an average inkjet. Inkjet prints have questionable long-term durability though, so you'll probably want laser printing or a photocopy. Ravenbit recommends you keep backups of the codes/addresses in a safe place, which is good advice for any cold wallet.  Ravenbit's site, unlike some other cold wallet producers, does not offer to generate your keys for you. This is a positive, as you should always generate keys offline. Services like Bitaddress.org and BitcoinPaperWallet.com have downloadable generators to use this way.  For added security I created a BIP38 encrypted wallet with a secure password, meaning that even if someone could scan my private key, they could not easily steal my bitcoins.  To attach these tiny keys to the Ravenbit coin, you have to cut them out and stick them in the indented square on the back of the coin. The instructions say to place the private key face down underneath, and the public key on top facing outward.  Of course if the coin isn't intended as a gift to someone else, you could always leave the private key off altogether and store it in a safer place.  You then cover them with the transparent hologram sticker provided and voila, if you can get it centered properly without messing up, you actually have a pretty nice looking coin. If you're the kind of numismatist who thinks things like QR codes and holographic stickers are appropriate design elements on coins, that is.  One advantage of this method is that the coins can be re-used: once you've removed the sticker and swept the private key, you can simply print new QR codes and stick them on. Ravenbit sells replacement hologram stickers as well.  Pros  Impressively well-crafted, with fine detail  Simple and elegant design, no circuitry motifs, bad fonts or URLs  Available in limited editions and a small variety of designs and metals  Reasonable price  Good conversation starter, impressed non-bitcoiners  Cons  Printing/attaching small printed QR codes a bit fiddly  Coin form factor not the most practical way to keep a bitcoin cold wallet  Competitors  With the demise of legendary coin producer Casascius after FinCEN defined its business model as 'money transmission', physical wallet manufacturers have had to take a different course.  No longer able to imbue their products with actual bitcoin value before sending to buyers, it is now mostly the buyer's responsibility to set up a wallet and add bitcoins to it.  Several of the physical coins CoinDesk looked at in September are now either out of stock or off the market, suggesting the market may have been limited.  Coins are also not the most practical form factor for containing both a public and private bitcoin key, allowing senders to see/scan one without revealing the other. Ravenbit's compromise uses paper and stickers.  Conclusion  I confess I have a personal fascination for the coin form factor, and there's something inherently satisfying about the size and weight of a one-ounce metal coin in the hand, which the Ravenbit coin fulfills.  Despite the impracticality of using a 1.57-inch diameter metal disc as a bitcoin cold wallet, coins are still great as gifts, conversation starters, and a metaphor for bitcoin as money that even non-users can relate to on a visceral level.  I gave my wife a metal Cryobit cold wallet as a christmas present. While the weight of the stainless steel and resilience of its ceramic glass etching are impressive, it went straight into her wallet and hasn't been seen since.  Had I given her a Ravenbit coin instead, it might have stayed out long enough for people to see and talk about it.  From experience, pulling out the Ravenbit coin to show non-bitcoiners always generated a few ooohs of interest and saw the coin get passed around, with even the odd ""Oh, is that an actual bitcoin?"" or ""I've been thinking about getting into bitcoin"" thrown in.  Metal coins work as a skeuomorphic avatar for bitcoin as 'money' and 'value' in the 'real' world, and the word 'bitcoin' itself invites their existence. They are also, it seems, necessary to create clip-art for bitcoin stories in non-bitcoin news publications.

42426229,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGEXh,1420391504,6 (More) Bitcoin Myths Debunked,"We've all heard them before.  As a groundbreaking innovation, bitcoin naturally attracts skeptics just as strongly as it attracts supporters, and the technical and theoretical complexity of the digital currency can cause a considerable amount of confusion with those who are not 'in the know'.  The result is that critics of bitcoin oftentimes fall back on one or two euphemisms to express why they think it will never succeed – simplified statements like ""bitcoin is a ponzi scheme"" that higlight often misunderstood characteristics of the digital currency but rarely fully address the situation.  One of the first articles published on CoinDesk was dedicated to debunking these ""bitcoin myths"", and because they still pervade the industry, we're revisiting the topic.  Here are six (more) bitcoin myths, debunked.  1. It's just a speculative investment opportunity  Many people first hear about bitcoin in the context of its price. Whether it was the bubble of late 2013 or the recent dip below $300, a good chunk of the general public thinks of bitcoin only in terms of how volatile the price is and how good (or bad) of an investment it could be.  The truth is, of course, that bitcoin goes far beyond its classification as a commodity. The decentralized peer-to-peer payment network made possible by bitcoin is only one example of how bitcoin is breaking down doors. If the price of bitcoin were theoretically to stay the same forever, it would still have utility in many other areas other than as a speculative investment.  2. The blockchain is the real breakthrough and bitcoins are unnecessary  It's true – the blockchain is arguably the real genius of Satoshi Nakamoto's invention. The distributed ledger and trustless security of the blockchain is what gives bitcoin its magic, but oftentimes when people first realize this, they discount bitcoin as just one use case of the blockchain.  In reality, mining is the bread-and-butter of the bitcoin protocol, and without miners there would be no blockchain. Consequently, miners need to be rewarded for their work, otherwise they would have no incentive to contribute their time and computing power to maintain the blockchain. As its native reward token, bitcoin is essential to the functionality of the blockchain.  3. The government could/will shut it down  While governments around the world may still be figuring out how to approach digital currencies, many misinformed people fall into the trap of thinking that, like almost anything else we're used to, bitcoin could be shut down by governments if one or more of them hoped to do so.  Yes, governments have the power to make it very difficult for their citizens to use bitcoin and some form of government regulation is inevitable as bitcoin matures. Even so, because of its infrastructure, it would take considerable time, money and energy for any government to pose a serious threat to the global bitcoin network, if they even could at all.  4. You can't buy anything practical with bitcoin  Perhaps as a follow up to myth number one, a lot of people are surprised to hear that bitcoin is more than a speculative investment and that it can actually be used to pay for everyday goods and services.  In addition to the retailers above, PayPal has announced partnerships with bitcoin companies and Microsoft recently began accepting bitcoin for a host of digital content like games and videos. Add in the countless small businesses that accept bitcoin either online or in their brick-and-mortar locations, and it's safe to say there are options when it comes to spending your bitcoin.  5. There are no advantages of bitcoin over cash or credit cards  Once people realize that bitcoin can, indeed, be used to buy real things, they may not see what the digital currency has to offer that their incumbent payment methods like cash and credit cards don't. Luckily it doesn't take long to debunk this myth.  Some of bitcoin's most obvious benefits are its low transaction fees. Typically, transacting bitcoin saves merchants 1-3% compared to transacting credit cards, and when compared to services like Western Union, bitcoin is clearly superior – especially for sending money abroad.  6. The only people who would ever use bitcoin are tech nerds and criminals  Some of the earliest adapters of bitcoin may be techies and dark market shoppers, but the same could arguably be said about the Internet – and look who uses that now. Regardless of how esoteric the bitcoin community may be right now (and it's pretty esoteric), adoption takes time.  As entrepreneurs in the space continue to build consumer-friendly apps with bitcoin and awareness of the digital currency spreads, a more diverse crowd will come to use it in their everyday lives. There's also another important demographic that many forget about: the millions of unbanked people throughout the developing world who rely on mobile phones as their computer, bank and communication device all in one.  Whether it's any of the above myths or perhaps one of the 10 we previously debunked, bitcoin is ripe with misunderstanding. For bitcoin to reach its full potential, this knowledge gap needs to be bridged so that the myths and misinformation come to an end.

42426230,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJGEZh,1420386143,19 Crypto 2.0 Projects to Watch in 2015,"As part of our 2014 recap, CoinDesk conducted a broad survey of the crypto 2.0 ecosystem to determine how the sector’s emerging influencers believe it will evolve in 2015.  Overall, the community perhaps most concerned with building on the potential of bitcoin’s pioneering protocol expressed a bullish sentiment, voicing its opinion that 2015 will bring increased attention as its most-anticipated projects hit the market.  The survey also asked respondents to name specific projects that they believe will have a significant impact on the crypto 2.0 ecosystem over the next year.  The result provided an in-depth view of the emerging players that could come to shape the crypto 2.0 community’s efforts in 2015, while providing insight into the philosophical questions that are now being debated by the wider bitcoin industry.  The following projects were cited by survey respondents and appear in alphabetical order:  BitAssets  One of the core products of pioneering crypto 2.0 company BitShares, BitAssetshttp://bitshares.org/the-value-proposition-of-bitshares-part-ii-bitassets/ allows users to peg a real-world asset (BitUSD and BitCNY are already trading) to the BitShares blockchain. BitAsset owners then earn money on trading fees, while allowing traders to hedge against bitcoin's fluctuations, a development proponents argue could stability to the wider market.  BlockSign  BlockSign leverages the recent addition of metadata to the bitcoin protocol to verify users have uploaded and signed a document. The live service aims to help enable the bitcoin network to become an attractive repository for more types of information, including legal documents that can then be enforced by smart contracts.  Codius    Currently in beta, Codius is a smart contracts protocol built by decentralized payment network provider Ripple Labs. While one of a few projects aimed at bringing smart contracts to market, proponents of the project argue that the platform could prove to be the scalable solution smart contracts need.  Counterparty  Emerging in 2014 as the arguable market leader of the crypto 2.0 movement, Counterparty saw an increasing number of 2.0 products and services leverage its protocol, forged a partnership with Overstock and traded barbs with rival Ethereum.  The project just celebrated its first birthday with a blog post in which its founders also speculated on what it has planned for the year ahead.  “We have even bigger plans for 2015: hiring new developers, releasing the desktop wallet, launching smart contracts on mainnet, electing the official board of directors, working with exchanges to support XCP, working with other business who want to build their products on Counterparty and much more,” the post reads.  Eris Ltd  Outrage over actions by the Bitcoin Foundation reached a fever pitch this summer, inspiring self-described “bitcoin millionaire” Olivier Janssens to issue a $100,000 bounty to whoever could create a decentralized alternative to the trade organization.  While developer Mike Hearn’s Lighthouse project took the top prize, Eris came in second for a proposed platform that seeks to enable decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), including those that could be used for decision-making in bitcoin, to better govern themselves.  According to Eris, one of its chief goals is to “design and build DAOs in such a way that they abide in full compliance with legal and regulatory obligations"".  Ethereum  By far the most widely cited project by the crypto 2.0 community, Ethereum has emerged as a market leader due to its roughly $15m in funding, even though it isn't expected to launch until this spring. Indeed, 2015 will be the year the smart contracts platform and its dedicated blockchain will be introduced to the market, where it will need to answer questions about its security and demand.  Should Ethereum prove itself to be a success as a viable alternative blockchain to the bitcoin protocol, other ambitious developers could be emboldened to strike out on their own, a development that could in turn impact bitcoin's long-term value.  When asked how his business plans will change in 2015, co-founder Vitalik Buterin told CoinDesk he hopes the platform will change how the community discusses and executes on its ideas, remarking:  ”The way that a new blockchain mechanism will be criticized will change somewhat. Right now, it's ‘don't like it, write a blog post explaining why and argue in the comments’. In one year it will hopefully be ‘build a DApp around it in the real world, see if it survives.’”  Factom  Another sometimes divisive unlaunched project, Factom is one of a few notable projects seeking to build a data layer on top of bitcoin that could help businesses better manage everything from title records to legal apps. With its white paper introduced in November, the project is expected to move forward with development in 2015.  Filecoin  Backed by big names such as Winklevoss Capital and Y Combinator, Filecoin seeks to create a data storage network on the bitcoin network. While relatively quiet about its support and goals in 2014, Filecoin inventor Juan Batiz-Benet recently told CoinDesk he expects to make big announcements in early 2015.  Gems  Decentralised social messenger Gems became one of the most buzzed-about bitcoin startups of 2014, raising more than $500,000 in its ongoing crowdsale. In 2015, Gems will seek to deliver to those who backed the project by buying its native token, introducing a wallet and token system in March, an Android app in June and an advertising platform in September as it seeks to introduce new users to bitcoin.  Koinify  Backed by $1m in venture capital, Koinify is perhaps the most notable attempt by the crypto 2.0 ecosystem to create a decentralised alternative to Kickstarter. With its first crowdsale for the decentralised messaging service Gems underway, and going smoothly, the platform will look to onboard more projects in 2015 while proving that the so-called cryptoequity movement can produce consumer-friendly products.  Pebble  While still only a proposal, the Pebble project seeks to build its own decentralised cryptocurrency that can support “millions of transactions a second” through a new security model it dubs “proof of processing”.  “Pebble will power a range of applications currently not practical with conventional cryptocurrencies,” the project boasts in its online overview.  MaidSafe  Fresh off its controversial crowdsale in early 2014, MaidSafe is busy putting the $7m it received from the crypto community to work building its decentralised platform for decentralised applications. When asked what the biggest hurdle would be for MaidSafe in 2015, COO Nick Lambert indicated bolstering its development team with qualified engineers was top of mind.  Medici  Bitcoin’s most vocal merchant, Overstock, and its CEO Patrick Byrne were everywhere in 2014, evangelizing for the benefits bitcoin can offer in online payments.  Looking ahead to 2015, many respondents were optimistic its ambitious Medici project, helmed by two leading Counterparty developers, would launch its decentralised stock market. Although, as others involved suggest, it remains unclear just how quickly the project will be able to advance on its aims.  download our research report.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/04/19-crypto-20-projects-to-watch-in-2015,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12c874b57f8f0d931062d24a4cd85ef7d277a391-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
