Related Reading: Notcoin (NOT) Ignites Crypto Market, Analyst Predicts 25% Rally Santiment says that on July 14, the number of deals worth $1 million or more went through the roof. This made people aware that the price of the token could change a lot. Large transactions often show what big buyers are doing, so they have a big effect on how the RNDR market moves. Institutional Interest And Market Influence The large number of whales trading RNDR coins shows that big buyers see the token as a valuable asset. When whales jack up their buying activities, the price may go up, otherwise it remains stagnant. It’s clear from this pattern how important establishment players are in setting market trends. In the past, when there were more whale trades, the price of RNDR tended to go up. Looking back at similar events in March and May, we can see that RNDR’s price went from being bearish to being positive. This shows that whale behaviour is linked to price increases. The price of RNDR was $6.20 at the time of the news, down 8.85% in the last 24 hours. Even though there is a short-term drop, other signs point to a possible positive trend. Render market cap currently at $2.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Network Activity And Market Sentiment In addition to whale action, Render network metrics have gotten a lot better. IntoTheBlock data shows that the number of active addresses on the network has increased by 100% in the last week, which means that the number of users is growing. In addition to the increase in new members, there has been an 86% growth in the number of new locations. The mood in the market about RNDR has also improved. Analysts at Santiment say that the Weighted Sentiment measure has turned positive, which means that the market as a whole has better feelings about RNDR. Price increases often happen before positive mood does, because it shows that buyers are becoming more confident. Render Price Forecast Related Reading: Analysts Unanimous: Solana (SOL) To Soar 100% – Details Even though current sentiment has been negative and the Fear & Greed Index has been neutral, the long-term picture for Render Token is still positive. Render has a probability of increasing in price by around 226% and hit $21.51 by mid-August, according to current predictions. But the token’s success over the last 30 days, with 47% “green” days and 8.63% price fluctuation, makes it important to be careful.

The SEC had no further comments on the recently submitted S-1s and the final versions needs to be submitted by Wednesday.  ETH outperformed BTC on Monday, on the news of potential ETF trading approval.  Prospective issuers of a spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) were told by the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) on Monday that the funds can begin trading next Tuesday, two sources familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  SEC officials told one issuer that the regulator had no further comments on the recently submitted S-1s and that the final versions needed to be submitted by Wednesday, one of the source said, adding that the funds can subsequently be listed on exchanges on Tuesday, July 23.  A second source said it's possible that trading could start on Tuesday, after the ETFs are deemed effective next Monday.  Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas first reported the development on a social media post.  The issuers submitted amended S-1 documents last week but have yet to disclose some of the details, including how much management fee they will be charging investors. Only a few issuers, including VanEck and Invesco Galaxy, have so far revealed their fees.  Once live on the market, the spot ether ETFs could see inflows of up to $5 billion in the first six months, crypto exchange Gemini predicts. Steno Research said it expects inflows of up to $20 billion in the first year.  The price of ether rose as much as 7.3% on Monday, outpacing bitcoin's 6% gain, on the news of ETFs starting to trade next week. The broader market index CoinDesk 20 climbed 5.6% today.

31034946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629818,1721077232,"Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Price Is Headed To $4,000, Here’s Why","Crypto analyst Linda has made a bullish case for Ethereum (ETH), predicting that the second-largest crypto token by market cap could rise to $4,000. The analyst also explained what could lead to such a price surge. Why Ethereum Could Reach $4,000 In a post shared on TradingView, Linda highlighted the potential approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs as one factor that could trigger a move to $4,000 for Ethereum. She noted that the sentiment around these funds is positive, with traders waiting for news from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation: Who’s Been Buying Up All The BTC Dumped By The German Government? These Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to be approved anytime soon based on predictions made by market experts, including Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart. Similarly to Linda’s prediction, other crypto analysts like Michael van de Poppe have predicted that the Spot Ethereum ETFs will spark a massive rally for Ethereum. Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, Linda noted that Ethereum’s outlook is bullish and supports the crypto token’s potential rise to $4,000. She claimed that the trigger area for buyers was at $3,200. In line with this, she believes that further final consolidation of the price above the 200-day moving average and a breakout above $3,200 will “become the reason for strengthening,” with a potential price target between $4,000 and $4,800 in sight. On local timeframes, Linda also stated that there are “prerequisites for a bullish mood,” especially on the daily timeframe, where the analyst noted that a rebound from strong support is forming. Based on her analysis, Linda claimed that the overall outlook for Ethereum points to a further rise to $4,000. Ethereum’s Chart Identical To Bitcoin’s Before ETF Launch Crypto analyst Crypto Rover recently mentioned that Ethereum’s chart is identical to Bitcoin’s before the Spot Bitcoin ETFs launched. Based on this, the crypto analyst was suggesting that Ethereum could make a similar run to the one the flagship crypto enjoyed after the Bitcoin ETFs were approved. In another X post, the analyst stated that the Spot Ethereum ETFs would be approved, meaning that Ethereum’s price rally could already be on the horizon. ETH’s price surge is expected to happen thanks to the inflows the Spot Ethereum ETFs will record. Crypto research firm K33 predicts these funds could attract as much as $4.8 billion in their first five months of trading. Related Reading: Why Did The Cardano Price Surge 17% Amid The Crypto Market Crash? Crypto analyst Leon Waidmann also highlighted how these Spot Ethereum ETFs will spark a massive rally for Ethereum, stating that institutional investors will likely take a huge chunk of Ethereum’s dwindling supply once these funds begin trading. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $3,300, up almost 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42407858,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6mjA,1721074360,"Plaintiffs File New, Slimmed Down Complaint in Class Action Lawsuit Against Tether","Plaintiffs in an ongoing class action lawsuit against Tether and Bitfinex have filed a new, slimmed-down complaint accusing the crypto companies of manipulating the crypto markets and violating antitrust laws.  The second amended complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) on Monday, accuses Tether and its sister crypto exchange Bitfinex of operating a “sophisticated scheme to artificially inflate the price of cryptocurrencies” by pushing Tether’s dollar-backed stablecoin, USDT, into the cryptomarket without it being fully backed by U.S. dollars, therefore “creating the illusion of increased demand” for cryptocurrencies, “facilitating trading of [cryptocurrencies] on credit and loaned funds” and ultimately driving up crypto prices.  The complaint is the third to be filed in the same case, overseen by U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla. The first complaint was filed in 2019 and an amended complaint followed in 2020.  Read more: Crypto Traders’ Lawsuit Claims Bitfinex, Tether Cost Market Over $1 Trillion  The case has had several hiccups, including the removal of the original plaintiffs’ counsel, crypto law firm Roche Freedman (now called Freedman Norman Friedland), after video recordings of attorney Kyle Roche appearing to admit to filing frivolous investor lawsuits to help client, surfaced in 2022.  In the newest iteration of the complaint, attorneys for the plaintiffs levied three causes of action against the defendants – violating the Commodities Exchange Act (CEA) via market manipulation, monopolization, and agreement in restraint of trade – the latter two causes of action both alleged violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. It’s a slimmed down version of the previous complaints: the original complaint contained eight causes of action, and the amended complaint contained 12.  The suit contained chat and deposition logs from the companies' operators, allegedly admitting to manipulative actions.  ""[Tether Chief Financial Officer Giancarlo] Devasini also acknowledged at his deposition that issuing a substantial credit line 'that is not backed by anything of an enormous amount of money' would cause customers to 'use this fake money to buy an enormous amount of Bitcoin and, therefore, the price will increase,'"" the suit said.  A spokesperson for Tether said the claims in the second amended complaint, “as with the prior complaint” are “wholly without merit.”  “Ultimately, it is the facts and evidence that matters, not plaintiffs’ false and misleading allegations,” the spokesperson for Tether said. “We remain confident that we will prevail in this litigation, and that plaintiffs’ nonsensical conspiracy theories will be rejected.”  Last year, lawyers for Tether and Bitfinex filed a memorandum of opposition against the plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint for a second time, calling it “in reality a motion for leave to start over” after the discovery process had concluded, but in June, Failla ultimately granted the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file the second amended complaint.  The lead plaintiffs in this case are U.S.-based crypto traders Matthew Script, Benjamin Leibowitz, Jason Leibowitz, and Pinchas Goldshtein, though several other civil class action suits and their plaintiffs have also joined the case.

31032079,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629841,1721071857,"Solana Dominating Ethereum: SOL Analyst Now Targets $1,000","Following Bitcoin and other altcoins like Ethereum, Solana is edging higher, clawing its way back after sharp losses in June. Even though the buyers are yet to reclaim the $155 support level, the expansion over the last few days has seen the coin add 25% after plunging in early July. Is SOL Preparing For $1,000? These encouraging gains over the last few days have seen traders project major gains in the coming days and weeks. Taking to X, one analyst said the coin would easily be more than 6X from spot rates, rallying to as high as $1,000 in the next bull cycle. As things stand, it is evident that SOL is already in an uptrend. At the depth of the bear run in 2022, the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research saw SOL plunge to as low as $8. The coin rallied over the last few months, especially from H2 2023, reaching $210 in March 2023. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Run: SOL’s 5% Surge Brings $160 Within Reach Nonetheless, the cool-off of the past three months hasn’t canceled out the primary uptrend. If anything, buyers are still in the driving seat, and even with recent losses, SOL is still up roughly 8X from October 2023. Several factors could propel Solana higher, even above the $220 recorded in the last bull cycle of 2021. A big part of this will be driven by the spike in adoption and the rise of Solana as the third most valuable smart contracts platform, only tracking Ethereum and the BNB Chain. As the home of meme coins, Solana is emerging as a choice platform for developers and traders. Most point to its high scalability and low transaction fees. At the same time, because there is no need to use off-chain solutions, some argue that Solana could be more secure than Ethereum layer-2 platforms like Base. Solana Dominating Ethereum, Spot ETF Hopes The spike in meme coins has pushed Solana’s on-chain activity higher, reading from the swelling DEX volumes. DeFiLlama data shows that Solana dominates Ethereum in daily and monthly DEX volume. On average, these DEXes process over $13 billion every week. If meme coin prices recover, exceeding the $65 billion peak registered in the last few months, reading from CoinMarketCap data, Solana will likely stretch Ethereum, cementing its position. Like BOME, WIF, BONK, and other Solana meme coins are among the most active and valuable. Related Reading: XRP Price Confirms Bullish Reversal: Crypto Analyst Forecasts ‘God Candles’ Ahead Even though the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) previously alleged that SOL is an unregistered security, some changes could challenge this preview. Recently, VanEck and 21Shares applied with the regulator to approve spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The application is still in the early stages, but the final decision will be made before the end of Q1 2025.

Bitcoin Rally Has Resulted In Short Liquidations On Derivatives Market According to data from CoinGlass, the latest volatility in the cryptocurrency market has led to large liquidations on the derivatives side. “Liquidation” here naturally refers to the process that any open contract undergoes where its platform forcibly closes it off after it has amassed losses of a certain degree. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Stalls As HODLers Apply Selling Pressure The table below shows how the derivatives liquidations have looked during the last 24 hours: It would appear that the cryptocurrency derivatives market has registered total liquidations of $126 million in the past day. Out of these, almost $101 million of the contracts were short ones. This figure is equivalent to more than 80% of the total, implying that these investors betting on a bearish outcome for the market were the most heavily affected by the latest volatility. This naturally makes sense, as assets across the sector have seen green returns in this window, led by Bitcoin’s rally. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly called a “squeeze“, and as shorts were the side that contributed to a majority of these liquidations, the squeeze would be known as a “short squeeze.” During a squeeze, liquidations end up feeding further into the price move that caused them, thus unleashing a cascade of further liquidations. As such, the sharp price surge in the past day would in part be fueled by the short squeeze. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Forced Weak Hands Into Largest Loss-Taking Since 2022 Lows: Report As for the breakdown of this latest squeeze for the various symbols, it would seem like Bitcoin has come out on top like usual with around $45 million in liquidations. Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have made up the rest of the top three with $24 million and $8 million in liquidations, respectively. Interestingly, while most of the sector has seen the dominance of short liquidations, XRP (XRP) on fourth has seen longs edge out instead. This may be down to the fact that the coin has overall only moved sideways while the rest have rallied. BTC Has Managed To Reclaim The $62,000 Support Level With the latest rally, Bitcoin has been able to make some significant recovery, with its price even briefly surging above the $63,000 level earlier in the day. The chart below shows what the coin’s surge has looked like: According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin is now floating above the significant on-chain support level of $62,000. “While resistance is strong above, enough bullish momentum can prevent selling pressure,” notes the analytics firm.

42407855,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6mZF,1721062552,A Crypto-Focused Bank? Tell Me More…,"Gregory Mall, AMINA Bank Ltd., discusses a “crypto bank,” how they stay compliant and manage the regulatory environment, and a new index that aims to provide returns similar to Bitcoin while reducing volatility and extreme drawdowns.  The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial. Authors' views and opinions are their own and not associated with CoinDesk Indices, nor AMINA Bank Ltd.  It’s interesting that a bank is bullish on cryptocurrencies. Can you elaborate a little more on the bank and what its objectives are?  First and foremost, we are a crypto bank. Our mission and vision have always centered around cryptocurrency—it's in our DNA. Unlike traditional banks that venture into crypto as a side business, it is the core of our operations. That said, we also offer all the core services a traditional bank provides. In other words, we are a traditional bank for crypto clients and a crypto bank for traditional clients.  Our vision has always been to build a bridge between the traditional financial world and the new digital landscape. We focus on simplifying banking with our motto, “Crypto Banking Simplified.”  Our client base consists of a mix of institutional and professional investors, including crypto-natives, foundations, and traditional investors. Among our clients, we also count numerous corporates and traditional banks, using our B2B solutions. Many traditional banks recognize the significant opportunities in the crypto market but face regulatory requirements, crypto infrastructure and the need for extensive resources and expertise. They need a partner like us—regulated and knowledgeable about the crypto asset class. This makes us a valuable partner for these institutions.  What specific cryptocurrency services do you offer your clients and how do you manage the compliance/regulatory process behind them?  We provide comprehensive banking services, including lending, securities, and brokerage—everything you'd expect from a traditional bank. On the crypto side, we offer custody solutions and trading through our in-house platforms. Additionally, we provide 24/7/365 customer support and a dedicated OTC options desk for derivatives trading. A significant aspect of our services is asset management, where we aim to position ourselves as a crypto product provider, making cryptocurrency more accessible to traditional investors who prefer not to deal with self-custody or other associated complexities. They can purchase our products directly from their bank accounts as they do for other products and in that way, we simplify crypto banking and give access to crypto to more investors.  Regarding Compliance and relevant applicable regulations, we apply the industry standards such as KYC and AML checks that are used by traditional banks. However, as we mainly deal with crypto, there are additional challenges. There are specific rules and guidelines for crypto assets and as the domain is new, they need to be interpreted and implemented. For example, when we receive crypto funds from a client, we assess if these coins are “tainted,” meaning, if they have been involved in any illicit activities. We screen these coins using publicly accessible blockchain data, allowing us to trace their activity and ensure compliance as part of our screening process. This is just one example to illustrate the challenges associated with regulated crypto activities.  What can you tell us about the new AMINA CoinDesk BTC Momentum Index?  In collaboration with AMINA, CoinDesk Indices launched a new index, the AMINA CoinDesk BTC Momentum Index (Ticker: BTIAMINA). The primary goal of this index is to provide returns similar to Bitcoin while reducing volatility and extreme drawdowns. Studies, such as those conducted by Fidelity, show a strong interest in digital assets among traditional investors. However, many of these investors are concerned about the high volatility and significant drawdowns associated with this asset class. The index addresses these concerns by employing a dynamic allocation strategy between cash and Bitcoin, thereby reducing overall volatility. The index can be used as an underlying for innovative products.  This approach is 100% transparent and systematic, with no element of discretion. Market research illustrates that crypto investing is often influenced by mental biases such as loss aversion. By adopting a purely systematic investment method, we can circumvent or even eliminate these biases. The index relies entirely on proven signals with a long-term track record, commonly used in other trading strategies. This is the core idea behind what we aim to achieve with this index.  What knowledge level do your clients have about crypto when they come to you, and do you have any educational resources you provide to them to understand and navigate the cryptocurrency market?  Broadly speaking, we distinguish our clients between the crypto-savvy who are well-versed in digital assets but may lack some banking knowledge, and traditional investors who are interested in entering the crypto space. For the latter group, we offer extensive resources through our research department, which covers a wide range of topics including custody, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. We also provide market analyses, all of which are freely available on our website.  Additionally, we participate in client meetings to explain fundamental concepts, as many traditional investors need education to confidently enter the crypto market. Understanding the basics of Bitcoin and how it works is crucial for them to make informed decisions.  Do the Swiss banking laws allow anyone to work with you or do you have to be Swiss-based or EU-based?  We operate globally from our regulated hubs in Switzerland, Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. In addition to Switzerland, we hold local licenses in Hong Kong and the UAE. These multiple licenses allow us to operate effectively with boots on the ground in Europe, the Middle East and in Asia.  What haven’t I asked you?  We also have a broader reach beyond the clients we onboard directly. Our listed products are available on our website, and any client with access to the exchanges where these products are listed can purchase them. This allows investors to benefit from our products and expertise even if they are not directly onboarded with us.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Kim Greenberg Klemballa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2024/07/15/a-crypto-focused-bank-tell-me-more,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d3a1c512f821c51ebfb500279b1dee9da5c500b-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390750,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8f01,1721062382,A Crypto Trading Clampdown Expands Beyond Binance to Another Large Exchange,"Crypto exchanges appear to be cracking down on who is eligible for the discounted trading fees they offer to their largest customers.  OKX, the second-largest exchange, just asked prime brokerages for more information, following changes at larger rival Binance.  Cryptocurrency exchanges are cracking down on brokerages that bundle clients' orders to enjoy lower, VIP trading fees.  In a letter reviewed by CoinDesk, OKX, the second-largest exchange by volume, recently asked prime brokers for details of subaccounts including the names of the entities or individuals that control each subaccount and the jurisdiction in which they are located. OKX said it needs the information by July 17.  ""A failure to do so may result in undisclosed subaccounts being restricted from trading and/or subaccount closure,"" the letter said.  Earlier this month, OKX's larger rival Binance changed its Link Plus interface, effectively closing a loophole that let prime brokers use a multitiered fee system to offer rebates to clients. Binance said the measure was ""to uphold compliance and ensure a level-playing field for all users, whether they access Binance directly or via an intermediary."" That news was first reported by Bloomberg.  Exchanges offer their biggest customers discounted trading fees, treating them like VIPs to boost the odds they'll stick around. Prime brokerages – firms that provide trading services for professional, and often large, investors – could, in theory, funnel several customers' trading through a single account at an exchange, qualifying for those lower fees.  ""This is being done very much for the purpose of disbanding clients under brokers to price them separately,"" said a person familiar with the prime brokerage industry who asked to remain anonymous.  OKX declined to comment.  Bybit, another large crypto exchange, is ""closely monitoring the recent developments regarding the removal of the prime brokerage multi-tiered fee structure by other platforms,"" said Eugene Cheung, the firm's head of institutions.  ""However, we have no plans to make any changes to our fee structure.

The bank has announced the timeline for the conclusion of the ongoing BTC liquidations, predicting a subsequent rebound in the market. JP Morgan Predicts Bitcoin Market Rebound In August In a research report on Wednesday, JP Morgan suggested that BTC liquidations should abate this July, foreseeing the start of a strong bull market as bearish trends caused by sell-offs subside. While the bank believes that a market recovery is imminent, it is also skeptical about the sustainability of high Bitcoin inflows in its year-to-date flow into crypto assets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees 868% Spike In Whale Buys, Bulls Ready For Breakout Rally For one, JP Morgan has revised and grossly reduced its former year-to-date crypto net flow from $12 billion to $8 billion. So far this year, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been the major driver for substantial inflows into the crypto market. JP Morgan’s skepticism also stems from Bitcoin’s high price relative to its production cost and the price of gold. A crypto analyst from the bank, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou has suggested that the bank’s reduction in the estimated year-to-date net flow was also due to the recent decline in Bitcoin reserves across exchanges. The decline in Bitcoin reserves over the past month is believed to be a result of the ongoing selling pressures and widespread BTC liquidations executed by Mt Gox creditors and the German government. As mentioned earlier, JP Morgan has predicted that this BTC sell-off will officially end in July, giving rise to a substantial bullish rally for Bitcoin in August. Following the bank’s predictions, many crypto analysts and community members have suggested that the recent upsurge in Bitcoin’s price is the continuation of a strong bull market. A crypto analyst identified as ‘CryptoYoddha’ on X (formerly Twitter) has revealed that the German government was preparing to sell their remaining BTC just before the bull run. Despite the aggressive selling by the German government and the subsequent market turmoil, the analyst noted that Bitcoin still appears bullish. About The Ongoing BTC Liquidations Earlier in June, Mt Gox announced that it would be making repayments to creditors in July. While the defunct Bitcoin exchange’s decision to start its repayment process comes as good news to creditors, there is also an underlying unease concerning potential Bitcoin sell-offs. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Gear Up For Recovery – Can Spot ETFs Push Price To New Highs? With creditors steadily receiving part of Mt Gox’s 142,000 BTC payment worth about $9 billion, the market fears are somewhat justified as a widespread Bitcoin dump would have a major impact on the price of the cryptocurrency. In addition to Mt Gox’s substantial Bitcoin redistribution plans, the German government has also been seen selling almost 100% of its Bitcoin holdings seized from criminals. These substantial crypto liquidations have put a major damper on the price of Bitcoin, triggering serious price declines that have significantly delayed the highly anticipated Bitcoin bull run. A crypto analyst identified as ‘Rekt Capital’ has indicated that the Bitcoin bull market based on standard halving cycles has already advanced by 40.1%.

42390748,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8ekd,1721059916,Trump’s Speech at Bitcoin Conference Will Mark a Pivotal Moment for Crypto,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump is still scheduled to speak, in person, at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville later this month, despite injuries he sustained from a failed assassination attempt Saturday. For crypto, this is huge.  Crypto is now on the campaign trail in an official capacity, extending beyond throwaway lines to appease whichever voting demographic and fundraising PAC is to be appeased that day. The shred of legitimacy the industry has been begging for since its inception has arrived, embodied in an orange man at a conference about an orange coin.  I’m no political strategist, but I always found it strange when presidential candidates spend time campaigning in states they have no risk of losing. Trump, or any Republican candidate for that matter, is not going to lose Tennessee in the 2024 presidential election (let’s face it, folks: Joe Biden is no Bill Clinton). And yet, Trump is stopping by a Bitcoin conference in the Volunteer State, during the immensely busy campaign season, in the same way a candidate makes stump speeches in airplane hangars for the military vote and in front of factories in the name of the American blue collar, with Teamsters in tow, for the union vote.  Even though the polls and data suggest that most people don’t use or own crypto — 7% of American adults used or held crypto in 2023 (according to the Federal Reserve), 28% of Republicans hold or had once bought crypto (according to crypto investment firm Paradigm), 52 million Americans own it (according to crypto exchange Coinbase) — it’s still part of Trump’s reelection strategy. The GOP has even added crypto to its official platform marketing materials (in the unabridged, pdf-downloadable version) under the “Champion Innovation” subpoint, just above “Artificial Intelligence” and “Expanding Freedom, Prosperity, and Safety in Space.”  Trump’s appearance in Nashville has a clear message: The content of the conference is more important than the location. There are enough single-issue crypto voters out there to make a difference for Trump.  (At least, enough if you factor in prospective donations from the crypto rich: A Trump fundraiser at the event costs more than $800,000 a seat.)  The Republicans have been jostling (against … no one, except maybe Independents or Libertarians) to be viewed as the pro-crypto party in the United States. One example is the preemptive anti-CBDC official declarations by people like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (perhaps to appear anti-China and pro-capitalism). Another is the voting effort in the House of Representatives to overturn President Biden's veto of a pro-crypto resolution falling neatly on party lines (save one Republican dissenter and some bipartisan support via 21 democrats).  To me, it appears that in this election cycle, crypto is standing in as a feather in the cap for the individual freedom talking point GOP voters love, to the point where Trump has completely backtracked on his anti-crypto rhetoric. In 2019 Trump tweeted: “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....” Then in 2021 he said Bitcoin is a scam against the dollar” during a Fox Business interview.  But then earlier this year at a Mar-a-Lago dinner he voiced his support, saying “…if you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump”.  Clearly, there are votes to be won and Trump wants them.  50 million voters, 100,000 votes: It’s going to get weird  We’re due a healthy scoop of reality. Say there are 50 million crypto holders, as Coinbase suggests. Are they all really single-issue voters?  No. Of course not.  In an interview with CoinDesk’s Marc Hochstein last year, founder of crypto research firm Messari and social media rabble-rouser Ryan Selkis, who has declared ""‘war"" against Chairman Gary Gensler's SEC and Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) anti-crypto army, tacitly acknowledged that not everyone who held crypto would vote for the pro-crypto candidate.  But you don’t even need that to win.  ""Certain states are only won or lost by tens of thousands of votes. So you don't need to have 50 million people become single-issue voters. You only need a couple hundred thousand in the right areas,"" said Selkis.  He’s right. I submit that the 2024 U.S. presidential election will be decided by something like 100,000 votes (not the popular vote, of course, I mean net votes in the battleground states) and so if a candidate is to win, he needs as many votes as he can get in the high-stakes areas. And because President Biden appears to have no interest in dealing with or courting the crypto vote (a significant misstep, in my opinion, as appearing pro-crypto isn’t enough to turn people off a candidate so long as the positioning is correct), every single-issue crypto voter is likely to vote for Trump and try to influence those around them to also vote for Trump.  In this way, it makes perfect sense that the GOP believes crypto is a worthwhile place to win some of those critical votes.  What’s more, the conference is a spectacle which people are traveling to Tennessee for. Trump won’t be speaking to Tennessee voters, he’ll be speaking to a geographically diverse (dare I … say … decentralized?) cross-section of American voters (that is, if you can get Bitcoiners to vote …).  It simply makes too much sense. Crypto is very clearly now solidified in the mainstream. And even though crypto is weird, American politics has been weird too. And the weirdness will continue: it’s going to be weird having Secret Service agents scattered about the Bitcoin conference, it’s going to be weird that mainstream media (and not just their financial or tech reporters) will be in attendance to cover the proceedings, and it’s going to be weird when President Trump again says he wants all the remaining Bitcoin to be Made in America.  I guess that when the going gets weird, the weird turn professional.

This comes as the asset manager on Monday posted better-than-expected second quarter earnings.  BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) added $4 billion in assets during the quarter.  BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink reiterated his belief that Bitcoin {{BTC}} is an asset that everybody should consider holding as part of their portfolio.  “My opinion five years ago was wrong,” Fink said in an interview with CNBC. “I believe bitcoin is a legitimate financial instrument,”  Fink's appearance Monday morning came following BlackRock's second quarter earnings results, which topped analyst estimates as assets under management increased 13% year-over-year to $10.6 trillion.

42390756,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8fPf,1721057455,Crypto Casino Founder Apologizes for Gambling Away Investor Funds,"Richard Kim is a former executive of Galaxy, the crypto firm headed by Michael Novogratz, as well as an alumnus of trading divisions at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs and a former attorney with the prestigious law firm Cleary Gottlieb.  Kim founded ""Zero Edge,"" a crypto casino designed with the idea that customers should get equal odds with the house.  Kim said in an interview that following a $7 million fundraising for Zero Edge, Kim entered into leveraged crypto trades that lost big as the bitcoin price fell in June.  Kim resigned on July 2, according to an email sent by the company to investors.  Galaxy was one of the investors, and says it has reported the conduct to authorities, but says the amount was ""immaterial.""  It's a tale as old as crypto, and maybe finance itself: One little money mistake leads to another, and suddenly a company founder is down a deep hole, with investors clamoring for their funds back.  In this case one of the investors is Galaxy, the prominent crypto firm headed by former Goldman Sachs and Fortress Investment Group executive Mike Novogratz.  The company founder, Richard Kim, was previously a general partner at Galaxy Interactive, a gaming-focused venture fund under Galaxy. He also worked at the Wall Street banks JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, following a stint at the prestigious law firm Cleary Gottlieb in the late 2000s, according to a bio. In an interview with CoinDesk, he said his cascading losses were fueled by a decades-long struggle with gambling.  Galaxy is one of several investors who are now the victims after Kim acknowledged misappropriating at least $3.67 million of company funds belonging to Zero Edge, a new blockchain startup led by Kim – until recently.  Kim pitched Zero Edge as a first-of-its-kind crypto casino, meant to level the playing field and give gamblers transparency. The name suggests that the house in the casino has no advantage over its customers.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Kim said Zero Edge raised more than $7 million in funding from investors, officially closing on a seed round less than a month ago. He stepped down from his role at the company after admitting to investors that he lost most of their funds in a series of bad crypto trades.  Kim told CoinDesk that the losses mounted as the bitcoin (BTC) price tumbled last month. The largest cryptocurrency's price has fallen to about $62,000 now from close to $70,000 at the start of June.  ""Mr. Kim left Galaxy in March 2024 to start Zero Edge, a company in which Galaxy had an immaterial balance-sheet investment,"" a spokesperson for Galaxy told CoinDesk. ""Upon learning of certain actions taken by Mr. Kim in his role at Zero Edge, we, along with other investors, reported his conduct to the authorities."" Galaxy's spokesperson declined to specify the size of the firm's investment in Zero Edge.  'Guys, I really f----d up.'  Kim said he also reported himself to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's public tip line.  ""Part of my rationale in reaching out proactively to the SEC was to say, OK guys, I really f—d up. I lost this money. It was grossly negligent. But I didn't intend to go run away with this money,"" Kim told CoinDesk.  In an email obtained by CoinDesk that was circulated to Zero Edge shareholders this month, the company said it closed a seed financing round on June 20. By the very next day, according to the email, Kim ""had begun placing leveraged positions on some cryptocurrencies, resulting, over the course of the next several days, in the significant loss of company funds.""  On June 29, according to the email, he informed the company's board of directors that he had ""lost approximately $3.67 million in company funds,"" and that he was solely responsible for the loss.  ""Since learning of these events, the company and the board have asked Mr. Kim to resign,"" the email reads, and he ""submitted such resignation on July 2.""  Downward spiral  ""The downfall began with a careless mistake - a phishing site that cost $80k,"" Kim said in his own recollection of what went wrong, which he shared with CoinDesk in a written statement. ""This triggered my old demons, the need to 'make it back' to preserve my reputation.""  According to Kim, he ""started down a negative spiral of leverage trading, raising more capital, and hiding the truth.""  ""By the seed round's close,"" said Kim, ""I was ready to rebuild, to start fresh, putting past demons aside. But the moment I received the proceeds, something snapped. I felt compelled to make up for my missteps. Within days, millions were in leveraged longs. When bitcoin crashed, I experienced a complete wipeout.""  The Zero Edge incident is the latest shenanigan to hit the blockchain industry's growing venture capital scene, which has been marred by controversy since its inception. Just a week ago, CoinDesk reported that Niraj Pant, a former general partner at top-tier crypto venture firm Polychain, had broken the fund's policies by making a secret financial arrangement with a company that he helped the fund invest in.  The Zero Edge incident amounts to a dramatic fall from grace for Kim, who graduated from the University of Washington at age 18 and the prestigious Columbia Law School at only 21, in 2007.  Before joining Galaxy in 2018, Kim built an impressive resume in the traditional financial sector: From 2015-2018, he was a chief operating officer for Goldman Sachs' global foreign exchange and emerging markets trading division, where he helped to lead a buildout of the Wall Street firm's digital-assets franchise in 2018. Before that, he was the co-COO of global foreign exchange and emerging markets trading at JP Morgan.  Kim says he remains intent on building out his vision of a blockchain-based casino and ""has every intention"" of paying back his investors. He disagrees with decisions made by his partners and the company's board to, in his view, wind the company down.  Zero Edge did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Quoting Jung  ""We basically have a year of runway to build this thing,"" Kim said in his interview with CoinDesk. ""Instead, the company was forced down the path – for reputational risk mitigation – to basically shut everything down, which, in my opinion, was not the optimal decision for the broader set of investors in the company.""  ""I messed up catastrophically. But I refuse to give up,"" Kim added in his written statement. ""To my investors: you didn't just back a project; you invested in my vision, my potential. I will continue building because the world desperately needs what we started. It is precisely the fact that I have proven untrustworthy that compels me to create trustless systems.""  In his statement, Kim cited the Jungian Swiss psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz, in turn quoting the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung himself as once saying, ""To be in a situation where there is no way out, or to be in a conflict where there is no solution, is the classical beginning of the process of individuation. It is meant to be a situation with solution...

This spike coincides with a slew of noteworthy occurrences that both experts and investors have noticed. Related Reading: Ethereum Seen Hitting $5,000 as German Bitcoin Sell-off Shakes Market Dormant Wallet Turns Into Action The turning on of a long-dormant Bitcoin wallet is among the most interesting events. Known as “1 EhXAfST,” the wallet had been dormant for almost 12 years until abruptly sending 1,000 BTC—worth about $60 million—to two new wallets. Given the wallet’s background, this shift is very important; each BTC was only worth $12.06, hence the initial investment was $12,060. With a current worth of $60 million, Bitcoin’s price rise over the previous ten years is clearly shown as amazing. 4 hours ago, the dormant wallet “1EhXAfST” woke up after 11.8 years and moved 1,000 $BTC (~$60M) to 2 new wallets! The wallet received those $BTC on Sep 25, 2012, when the price was only $12.06 ($12.06K). Watch out for more #Bitcoin updates by following @spotonchain and setting… pic.twitter.com/0YUVUWFKdJ — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) July 15, 2024 Although the causes of this movement are yet unknown, it has spurred debates about possible profit-taking or strategic repositioning by long-term owners. Nonetheless, experts believe that this one transaction is not expected to have a major influence on the general price of Bitcoin on the market. Raised Whale Activity And Accumulation Along with the dormant wallet’s ressurection, Bitcoin whale activity has clearly increased. As Bitcoin’s price dropped to about $53,500 during the previous week, big investors bought over 71,000 BTC, or almost $4.3 billion overall. Reported to be the quickest since April 2023, this accumulation pace points to a high positive attitude among the main market participants. The increase in whale activity corresponds with a period of price volatility, indicating that these big players might be seeing recent price declines as purchase prospects. This behaviour usually conveys assurance about the long-term future of the item. ETFs Boost Market Momentum The function of spot Bitcoin ETFs is another major determinant of the dynamics of the present market. With just the previous week acquiring $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin, these quite young investment vehicles have showed strong success. The whole Bitcoin holdings of US ETFs have been driven to fresh all-time highs by this flood of institutional interest. The great success of Bitcoin ETFs is interpreted as a good indication of the general acceptance of the bitcoin. It offers conventional investors a controlled way to get exposure to Bitcoin without really owning the asset, hence perhaps widening the investor base and raising general market liquidity. Overview Of Bitcoin Prices With Bitcoin trading at $63,165 as per the most recent statistics, it is over a significant trend line. Market players are attentively observing this present price point as it can suggest the direction of further price fluctuations. Technical experts propose that there is possibility for a further 8% price gain should Bitcoin keep its position above the $59,500 support level. The current patterns in accumulation and growing institutional interest support this perspective. Still, the market is vulnerable to change. A dip below $56,405 might indicate a turn towards negative attitude, maybe resulting in a 7.5% price decline. This emphasises how crucial the present support levels are for deciding temporary price swings. Related Reading: Notcoin (NOT) Ignites Crypto Market, Analyst Predicts 25% Rally The Road Ahead Meanwhile, rising ETF participation, awoken dormant wallets, and more whale activity all point to a market in change. Although these advancements are usually seen as encouraging signs, the bitcoin market is notoriously erratic. In the next weeks, experts and investors will be attentively observing several aspects. They will be looking for more moves from once inactive wallets to gain understanding of long-term holder mood.

31020347,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629796,1721050225,XRP Price Confirms Bullish Reversal: Crypto Analyst Forecasts ‘God Candles’ Ahead,"Crypto analyst Dark Defender has shared an extremely bullish technical analysis on XRP via X, suggesting a bullish reversal and the possibility of “God Candles.” The analysis uses a variety of technical indicators and chart patterns to project an optimistic outlook for XRP. XRP Price Poised For ‘God Candles’? The core of Dark Defender’s (@DefendDark) analysis is focused at two indicators which suggest a change of trend. The first one is the breakout above a descending trendline. This move is critical as it means that XRP eliminated its first key resistance and suggests a potential reversal from the downward trend which started in mid-March. It is particularly noteworthy as it indicates a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish. Supporting this trend reversal is the Fisher Transform indicator, which is crucial for identifying major price reversals. The Fisher Transform uses price data to produce a Gaussian normal distribution to signal potential changes in market direction. Related Reading: XRP Resilience Sparks Further Gains As Price Surpasses $0.466 Level On the weekly chart, a ‘Golden Cross’ is visible where the faster line of the Fisher Transform crosses above the slower line, typically a bullish signal in market analysis. This event is essential as it provides confirmation of the trend reversal signaled by the breakout from the descending trendline. “Ladies & gentlemen, XRP had the highly bullish Reversal approval for the Fisher Indicator weekly. Initial resistance instantly broke at $0.4623!” the crypto analyst remarked. However, it’s important to note that the digital asset is still navigating below the Ichimoku Cloud, indicating that resistance still lies ahead. The Ichimoku Cloud is a comprehensive indicator that provides insight into the momentum and future areas of support and resistance. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Colossal 280% Breakout Amid CME Group Partnership While the breakout from the descending trendline and the bullish Fisher Transform signal are promising, the price remaining below the Cloud suggests that XRP has yet to clear all hurdles and establish a stronger bullish presence. Additionally, the chart also details several key Fibonacci levels that are critical for understanding the next potential resistance and support zones. After breaking the initial resistance at $0.4623, XRP is currently testing the interim Fibonacci level at $0.5286. Dark Defender emphasizes the significance of the price closing above this level to sustain the bullish momentum: “Our interim Fibonacci Level, $0.5286, is being tested. It would be great to close this week’s candle above $0.53.” Notably, the XRP price didn’t manage to close the week above this price. Despite that, XRP is currently continuing the upward trend, trading above $0.53 today. The next resistance point to level is at $0.6044. Surpassing this level could lead to the creation of multiple “God Candles,” suggesting a rapid and sustained increase in price. Dark Defender remarked, “Next week, we will test the secondary mid-level resistance of $0.6044. It’s crucial not to underestimate the master fundamental level for XRP, which is $0.6649. Above it, we can expect multiple God Candles, which will open the path to Heaven’s Stairway.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.53494.

42390764,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8g4h,1721049942,"U.S. Secret Service Chief Probably Won't Be Fired, Polymarket Bets Signal","This week in prediction markets:  The head of the U.S. Secret Service will probably not be fired.  Trump's odds of victory in November remain at all-time highs while traders debate the would-be assassin's political leanings.  Bitcoin is going to stay above $58k by the end of the week.  The Wall Street Journal's front page spelled it out clearly: ""Trump Shooting Is Secret Service’s Most Stunning Failure in Decades.""  But will heads roll?  Probably not, says a Polymarket contract asking if the director of the U.S. Secret Service will be fired.  ""Yes"" shares are trading at 29 cents, meaning the market sees a 29% chance that Kimberly Cheatle will no longer be in her job on Sept. 1, when the contract expires.  Each share pays $1 if the prediction turns out to be correct, and zero if not. The bets are settled in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar, and programmed into a smart contract, or software application, on the Polygon blockchain.  Volume for this contract is thin, to be sure, just shy of $7,000, paling in comparison to the hundreds of millions riding on the outcome of the presidential election on Polymarket.  The shooting at Trump's rally Saturday created severe concerns about the Secret Service's planning. As the Journal reported, a nearby rooftop with an exposed view of the podium was not closed off prior, giving Thomas Matthew Crooks, identified by authorities as the would-be assassin, a vantage point. An eyewitness who spoke with the BBC claimed he spotted the gunman moments before shots rang out, compounding the narrative that this was a stunning failure on the authorities' part.  Congress is demanding answers.  The Secret Service slip-up has prompted lawmakers to propose enhanced protections, including for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has relied on private security after being denied a Secret Service detail. Last September, an armed individual impersonating a U.S. Marshal was arrested at one of Kennedy's events.  The top holder of the No side of the Polymarket contract, who goes by the handle 69696969, also holds a $9,100 position taking the view that Biden will finish his term, and a $4,400 position that Trump will not be in prison before election day.  Other shooting-related contracts have popped up.  Bettors are saying there's a 94% chance the gunman was a rogue actor not affiliated with a larger entity ($27,510 bet), while there's an 83% chance his political leanings were Republican ($121,494). (Crooks was a registered Republican, but donated to a Democrat-leaning group.)  Failed Assassination Plot Boosts Trump's Victory Odds  Trump's defiant fist was seen around the world in the moments after the failed assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.  Bettors on Polymarket believe this momentum will bolster his chances of re-taking the White House in November, as the ""Yes"" side of a contract asking if he'll win the election has edged past 70 cents to 71 cents, representing a 71% chance of his victory.  This is Polymarket's largest contract, with $258 million staked.  All the while, many of the largest traders on both sides of the debate kept their positions static, neither adding nor selling off their holdings.  The only two large traders that made any sort of move were Xav, who purchased almost $9,000 of the no-sided contracts starting an hour after the event, and GenMaiCha, who added over $16,000 on the Yes side the day following the shooting. Most of the new volume has come from new traders to the contract.  Bitcoin Steady, Will Remain Above 58K by Week's End, Say Bettors  Bitcoin began the week strong, as a Trump bump pushed the world's largest digital asset up 7% to above $62,500.  As CoinDesk reported earlier, some market observers have said that the assassination attempt on the pro-crypto presidential candidate increased market speculation about his potential election victory, which is seen as favorable for the cryptocurrency market due to his supportive stance on crypto regulation.  Polymarket bettors are saying the price is stable, at least for now, as there's a 93% chance of it trading above $58,000 by the end of the week.  The next Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled for the end of July, and a weakening labor market could prompt the Fed to cut rates even though inflation is still above its 2% target, which, in turn, would be bullish for the price of risk assets including crypto.  And if not in July, there's a 79% chance of a Fed rate cut by September, according to traders on Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated prediction market site where bets are settled in greenbacks.  And, Lastly...

The company's asset management segment is growing but could suffer from deceleration due to lower digital asset prices, while volatility risks may impact the derivatives business. There are also the after-effects of Bitcoin halving to contend with. Despite near-term volatility risks, there is long-term upside potential. Its price action versus Bitcoin shows the degree to which expectations have risen due to favorable catalysts. Since I last covered Galaxy Digital Holdings ( BRPHF ) in November last year in my bullish piece entitled "" Diversified Exposure To Bitcoin Mining (Rating Upgrade)"", it is up by nearly 100% as shown in the orange chart below . Seeking Alpha The price action also shows that after having shadowed Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), it has started outperforming since mid-May. This was mostly helped by revenues for the first quarter of 2024 (Q1) surging by 79% YoY to $259.7 million, its asset management segment switching back to growth for May, and the partnership with SSGA (State Street Global Advisors) to create new ETFs. However, since digital asset prices have depreciated in Q2, this implies volatility risks for the derivatives business and the Bitcoin halving event may delay breaking even for mining operations. Thus, after high expectations have been baked into the share price, this thesis aims to show that the stock could suffer when results are announced in August. I start by analyzing Q1's financial results, which were announced on May 14, and also included those for Galaxy Digital Holdings LP (limited partnership). Q1 Benefited From A Surge in The Price of Digital Assets First, for the sake of clarity, the relationship between these two Delaware-registered entities follows a typical corporate structure where Galaxy Digital Holdings is the publicly traded entity contributing to strategic direction whereas the LP operates the four reportable segments whose income statement is shown below. Starting with mining, which is at the very heart of the Bitcoin ecosystem, it forms part of the Digital Infrastructure Solutions segment where a total of $38.4 million were obtained as sales when including lending and staking revenues. Out of this $31.5 million was generated from proprietary mining and hosting which represents a 200% YoY increase, mostly as a result of rapidly scaling the Helios facility acquired from Argo Blockchain plc ( ARBKF ) in December 2022. Income of the reportable segments (investor.galaxy.com) Now, since BTC appreciated by 54% in Q1 and declined by around 4% in Q2, there should be a reduction in QoQ income since the Bitcoin halving event on April 19 resulted in rewards (or subsidy) dropping to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC for each block mined and added to the blockchain. Furthermore, with more miners competing on the network the average difficulty is about 60% more than one year earlier as shown in the chart below, increasing the cost to mine, thereby reducing profits. Now, as per the management update, mining gross profits for April which includes pre-halving and post-halving activities were mostly aligned with March figures (which exclude halving effects) due to more on-chain fee activity whereby the data is recorded directly into a blockchain. Another contributory factor was the optimized energy management plan using lower-cost power and software-driven mining operations. Data by YCharts However, the mining business despite including revenue from lending and staking was not profitable in Q1, delivering an income loss of $559K. Therefore, the halving and difficulty combination exacerbated by BTC remaining $13K below its Q1 peak of $73K could delay break-even. Despite this loss, Galaxy remains profitable as a whole and generated a net income of $421.7 million, thanks to two other segments, Global Markets and Asset Management. Looking Closer at Asset Management and the Derivatives Business After peaking at $7.8 billion in March as shown in the chart below, AUM for April decreased by 27.3% with one of the reasons being ""market depreciation"", or the value of digital assets falling. Table built using data from Seeking Alpha The other reason for the decline was the continued liquidation of assets associated with the FTX bankruptcy. This includes FTX's shares of Grayscale and Bitwise investment funds consisting of Bitcoins and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), which Galaxy secured last year, contributing to increasing the value of its assets. Furthermore, May's AUM increased by 10% relative to April despite FTX assets continuing to be liquidated, but this is far below the 32% achieved in the June to December period as shown by the yellow dotted line above. This is because the price of Bitcoin has remained below $60K while the FTX-related portion of the AUM continues to decrease over time. This implies that unless Mike Novogratz's company manages to secure (buy) more assets from bankrupt crypto companies, June's AUM will likely continue decelerating, especially if Bitcoin does not rise. Now, lower digital asset prices may also lead to lower revenues for the Global Markets segment where counterparty trading revenue increased by 79% QoQ, but this was mainly driven by its derivatives book which grew more in Q1 than the whole of 2023. In this context, given the dynamic nature of the crypto market, counterparty trading could be subject to market volatility risks. Switching to a more positive note, it is unlikely to face liquidity risks given that digital asset prices have not plummeted. Also, its book loan size of $664 million remains far below its total assets of $5.4 billion, versus liabilities of only $3.2 billion. Also, Galaxy held $247.2 million of cash at the end of March, down from $316.6 million at the end of 2023, but its balance sheet should benefit from a $125 million equity capital raise. Additionally, the dollar value of its digital assets was $2 billion, or double the amount held 3 months earlier, including $269.4 million of Stablecoins. Expect Near-Term Volatility Still, looking across the industry, halving has created uncertainty for miners as it has reduced their rewards by half in a period where financing costs remain high due to elevated interest rates, and not all of them have access to cheap power and operate as diversified entities in a way that can mitigate the impacts. Thus, as their profit margins get squeezed, they have been compelled to sell more of the Bitcoin they HODLed earlier, thereby increasing the supply and pressurizing asset prices. Therefore, unless there are clear signs that miners have adjusted to the post-halving scenario, the demand-supply equation is likely to be skewed to the latter, resulting in lower BTC prices. Shifting to Galaxy's role as an asset manager and coming back to the partnership with SSGA, this is one of the largest fund issuers with $4.14 trillion of assets under management. Moreover, its collaboration with Galaxy should see the launch of more sophisticated investment vehicles in the crypto space. Now, while this could represent product differentiation, one has to be realistic that there is already tough competition in the space with spot, futures, and equity ETFs. Consequently, it is preferable to wait for the ETF to be issued first and assess whether investors are attracted to them in the same way as the spot ETFs launched early this year. For this matter, after the initial frenzy, these have suffered from net outflows during the last three months, including the popular iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). In the same breath, after a lot of enthusiasm, after the SEC approved 19b-4 forms for the Invesco Galaxy Ether ETF, the reality is that there are seven other competing products, meaning that fees may have to be kept low to encourage inflows. Consequently, it was market optimism based mostly on positive news updates (as illustrated below) that propelled the stock higher and outperformed BTC by 15%. Henceforth, as reality bites, the stock could suffer from the same percentage of downside, especially in case of lower-than-expected ETF inflows and Galaxy's AUM showing slow progress in June. Thus, it could fall to $9.8 (11.5x0.85) based on its current share price of $11.5. Chart built using data from Seeking Alpha To further justify my cautious instance, the assets management business could post lackluster growth until Bitcoin goes back to its all-time high of $73K in Q1. Additionally, Galaxy boasts $514.8 million in Bitcoin spot ETF investments which has largely benefited from an uplift thanks to digital asset prices surging in Q1, but could henceforth suffer from outflows in case investors switch part of their crypto allocation from BTC to Ether, all in the name of diversification. Long*Term Potential Remains Intact Looking beyond volatility, its forward price-to-sales of 2x while being 30% above the ratio of 1.55x it was trading back in November last year, is still 25% below the median for the financials sector as shown below. Seeking Alpha This means that could represent an opportunity, but this is conditional to its mining business navigating the post-halving period while controlling operating expenses. For this purpose, it could be helped by its lower pre-halving cost-to-mine of about $19.5K per Bitcoin, compared to the industry's average break-even point of $23K. Additionally, network difficulty has seen a reduction from its peak of 88 as shown in the Bitcoin Average Difficulty chart above. Also, the Bitcoin network hash rate continues to decline as charted below due to fewer miners participating in production resulting in less competition for existing ones as it reduces transaction fees, which augurs well for Galaxy. Data by YCharts Furthermore, some miners could also go out of business, representing an opportunity for the diversified crypto play to acquire distressed assets at advantageous prices. To this end, one of the objectives of raising equity capital was to expand its mining activities for a company that is diversified across the crypto ecosystem, especially, in a conducive environment where the approval of spot ETFs both for Bitcoin and Ether signals that regulators are recognizing crypto as legitimate investment assets. Finally, progress has been made as to its U.S. listing, through responding to the SEC's queries and by adopting fair value accounting standards for crypto assets as per the FASB or Financial Accounting Standards Board.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4704077-galaxy-digital-holdings-brace-for-short-term-volatility?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31018585.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose to over $62,500 following the weekend attack on Donald Trump, which seems to have also boosted the former president's chances of winning a second term in November. Having cemented himself as the pro-crypto candidate compared with President Joe Biden, Trump's election prospects have become a metric for the cryptocurrency market. BTC has rallied over 7% since the failed assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. At the time of writing, it is priced at $62,476, an increase of 3.95% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has risen by 3.32%.  The probability of Donald Trump retaking the White House jumped to an all-time high on Saturday after the shooting at the Pennsylvania rally, according to traders on Polymarket. ""Yes"" shares in Polymarket's contract on whether Trump will win the presidency climbed 10 cents after the incident to 70 cents, meaning the market now sees a 70% chance he will prevail in November's election. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not. Meme tokens named after Trump also surged after the shooting. MAGA, for example, rose 34% on a 24-hour basis to $8.38, according to CoinGecko data, and the satirical TREMP added 67% to $0.6471. BODEN, a joke asset named after Biden, slipped about 15% over 24 hours to $0.0333115.  Alexey Pertsev, the co-founder and developer behind Tornado Cash, was denied bail by a Dutch court on Friday. Pertsev's lawyers were seeking bail to allow the Russian to prepare for his appeals process, but the court said ""that continuing his detention does not obstruct his possibility to prepare his defense,” Keith Cheng, Pertsev's lawyer said according to the report. Pertsev was found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch judge at the s-Hertogenbosch court in May and handed 64 months prison time by the court. The verdict sent shock waves within the community leaving several outraged. The case has been described as the most pivotal legal case in crypto.

31017227,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629793,1721044839,Solana Bullish Run: SOL’s 5% Surge Brings $160 Within Reach,"Solana (SOL) price is currently on a bullish move, climbing over 5% in the last 24 hours with strong bullish momentum toward the $160 resistance mark. Analyzing Solana’s growing momentum reveals that it could be fueled by recent active buyers’ activity in the market and optimism that the digital asset could be poised for further gain. As Solana draws closer to the $160 mark, we will delve into an in-depth examination of SOL’s upswing based on current price actions, and key indicators supporting this upward trend, exploring what this means for SOL’s future price prospects. SOL’s price is currently trading at around $153 and has increased by 5.66% with a market capitalization of over $71 billion and a trading volume of over $2 billion as of the time of writing. In the last 24 hours, SOL’s market cap and trading volume have experienced an increase of 5.68% and 28.45% respectively. Analyzing Technical Indicators Supporting SOL’s Bullish Trend Currently, the price of Solana on the 4-hour chart with bullish momentum has risen above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 4-hour bearish trendline. The digital asset has been able to maintain its bullish sentiment since these breaks and could continue its upward move toward the $160 resistance level. Also, the formation of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that SOL’s price may continue its bullish move toward the $160 resistance level as the signal line of the RSI indicator has been maintaining its bullish sentiment above 50% and is currently trending the overbought zone. On the 1-day, the price of SOL has broken above the bearish trendline, and it can be observed that the crypto asset is currently attempting a bullish move above the 100-day SMA towards the $160 resistance level. Since the break above the bearish trendline, Solana has been showing bullish resilience, keeping a steady pace toward the $160 mark. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a careful examination of the formation of the 1-day RSI reveals that SOL could sustain its bullish trend above the 1-day SMA and the bearish trendline toward the $160 resistance mark as the signal line of the indicator has risen above 50% and is currently attempting a move towards the oversold zone. Resistance And Support Levels For Solana To Watch If SOL can maintain its current bullish momentum to hit the $160 resistance level and close above, it may continue to move upward to challenge the $188 resistance level. When this level is breached, the digital asset may experience further price gain toward the $205 resistance level and possibly other levels above. Conversely, should SOL pull back at $160, it will start to decline once more toward the $118 support level. Following a break below this level, the crypto asset may see further price decline to challenge the $99 support level and perhaps other levels below.

Bitcoin halving has increased operational challenges for miners like Riot, leading to financial losses and potential share dilution for funding. Despite potential leverage to Bitcoin price movements, Riot's operational inefficiencies and financial struggles make direct Bitcoin investment a more profitable strategy. Investment Thesis Back in April, I covered Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), and rated the company as a hold. Since then, shares have fallen roughly 17.26%, while the market has increased by 10.74%. The recent Bitcoin halving has introduced considerable challenges for miners, including Riot. Post-halving, each ASIC miner now needs to work twice as hard to mine the same amount of Bitcoin, yet the anticipated price increase for Bitcoin has not materialized to offset this increased difficulty. In June 2024, Riot's Bitcoin production fell 45% year-over-year, highlighting the operational inefficiencies and heightened challenges the company faces due to this halving. ​ As a result of this, Riot Platforms is now losing money ( estimated for the upcoming quarterly report). I am concerned the company is going to have to reach for even more share dilution to fund the business, which would result in further shareholder losses. With this, I’m now downgrading my belief on the stock to a strong sell. Why I Am Doing Follow-Up Coverage As I mentioned above, when I covered Riot last in April , I marked the company as a hold. My reasoning for this was that miners were banking on Bitcoin (Bitcoin)’s prices doubling in order to sustain the competitive nature and costs. If Bitcoin’s prices had moved higher post halving, I would have been more bullish. However, this did not seem to be the case. Bitcoin prices have fallen, partly caused by miners needing to sell their stashed Bitcoin in order to support their valuation. Some miners have taken the approach of attaching Bitcoin miners to saunas to subsidize the cost of operating them, also known as selling the heat. While this has been helpful for some miners, I just don’t see Riot doing this, and I am skeptical of the company’s ability to find a long run sustainable way to augment mining costs (I will talk about the ERCOT grid program in the valuation section). Historically, they have not had a long run sustainable cost basis. With this, I believe updated coverage is warranted. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the effects this halving has had on their valuation. Bitcoin Miner Economics In the wake of the Bitcoin halving on April 19th of 2024, the core economics of the Bitcoin market are undergoing significant shifts. In the long run, the market is expected to absorb the increased supply of Bitcoin as struggling miners are forced to sell their reserves and eventually exit the business. This will occur because it is becoming increasingly difficult for miners to operate profitably under the new, more challenging conditions. As these less efficient miners leave the market, the remaining miners, who can sustain operations, will only mine Bitcoin at prices that are economically viable over the long term. This selective survival of the fittest should gradually lead to a higher equilibrium price for Bitcoin. The process works through the gradual reduction of Bitcoin supply as miners capitulate, leading to reduced sell pressure in the market. As a result, Bitcoin's price is likely to move higher over time, driven by the reduced supply and the sustained demand from investors and users. This increase in price is actually good for miners who are built for longevity and have a sustainable operational model. These miners can weather the tough periods and emerge stronger, receiving the rewards of higher Bitcoin prices in the future. However, Riot does not appear to be built for longevity. Despite their efforts to increase their hash rate and improve operational efficiency, Riot's financial health and operational sustainability are of concern for me. The company has faced significant production declines and financial losses​. In addition to the pressures placed on Riot from the Bitcoin halving, they seem to just be struggling overall with mining efforts. For example, during the latest earnings call, Colin Yee, Riot CFO, stated: During the first quarter of 2024, we mined 1,364 Bitcoin, which represents a decrease of 36% from the 2,115 Bitcoin we mined during the first quarter of 2023. This was primarily due to the significant increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023 -Q1 2024 earnings call . Keep in mind, this was before the halving, which occurred in April. Riot Bitcoin Mining Results (Riot Platforms) While the company mentioned during the call that they expect this number to move back up due to their increased hash rate capacity, I am unsure if they will be achievable due (we saw their mining yields drop significantly in June). While they saw an increase in Bitcoin mining from May to June (they produced 255 Bitcoin ), up 19% from May, they still year-over-year saw a 45% drop. Valuation & Financials On the surface, Riot’s forward P/E ratio may appear to make the stock attractive. While the company is forecasted to report GAAP profitability over the next 12 months , a big portion of what management is focusing on is their ERCOT program, buying power from the grid at low demand times to help the grid load balance. Riot Platforms P/E Ratios (Seeking Alpha) In essence, ERCOT’s program works by providing companies (like Riot) incentives and credits to purchase power at non-peak hours of grid operation. Management has praised this program as a way to help them keep their average costs per Bitcoin mined low (this is their answer to the Sauna heat capture business model). Unfortunately, I am highly skeptical this will be enough for Riot. Management in their Q1 earnings presentation highlighted the benefit. $5.1 million (and up 67% year over year). This is promising growth, but a small part compared to total revenue in Q1 ($79 million). Power Curtailment Credits (Riot Platforms) With this, Riots business appears highly commoditized to me. They are primarily mining Bitcoin and selling it on the open market. They took a 45% production hit when the halving occurred, and were down 36% in mining volume before this as well, which tells me they are not succeeding in grabbing market share (% of Bitcoins mined per day). This leaves me still at a strong sell. Their forward price to sales ratio stands at 6.96, 130.56% above the sector median (3.02). I am not confident at all in their ability to hit production targets for Bitcoin mining, given they saw a mining volume collapse even before the halving. With this, I think the stock should be valued at just the sector median price to sales. If the stock converged at this multiple, it would represent 56.7% downside in shares, assuming no dilution. Bull Thesis Despite what I believe to be core challenges Riot Platforms faces in their business model, there remains (what I believe to be) a single, solid bull thesis that should be considered. This lies in the price of Bitcoin. I believe the price of Bitcoin is likely to move higher in the long run due to its deflationary nature, increasing scarcity, and growing adoption. If Riot can survive the current operational and financial difficulties, they could benefit significantly from the long-term increase of Bitcoin prices. They do have 9,334 Bitcoins as of the end of June. This Bitcoin reserve effectively provides Riot with significant leverage to Bitcoin's price movements. As Bitcoin prices rise, the value of Riot’s holdings increases, potentially offsetting some of the operational losses and enhancing the company's overall valuation. This could be a huge levered Bitcoin investment,​ much like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). With this, many Bitcoin bulls argue that issuing stock in dollars to mine Bitcoin is a smart move. The logic here is that Riot is raising capital in an inflationary currency ((USD)) to invest in a deflationary asset (Bitcoin). Over time, assuming the value of Bitcoin continues to appreciate relative to the dollar, this strategy could pay off. This approach could be particularly advantageous if Bitcoin experiences significant price increases, allowing Riot to convert their mining operations and reserves into substantial profits. Despite the potential upside here, there are considerable risks. I believe Riot’s operational inefficiencies and financial struggles raise doubts about their ability to capitalize on long-term Bitcoin price increases. I think that investing in straight Bitcoin is a much better way to play Bitcoin, therefore potentially a more profitable strategy than investing in Riot’s future. Direct Bitcoin investment eliminates the operational risks associated with mining companies such as Riot and provides direct exposure to Bitcoin's price movements. To be clear, I am long run bullish on Bitcoin itself, just not Riot Platforms. If you're curious on my thoughts on Bitcoin itself, I wrote a piece on BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) in April. Takeaway Since the Bitcoin halving in mid-April, Riot has been facing significant operating challenges that have led me to adjust my past hold rating from April to a strong sell. This halving has caused each ASIC miner to now need to work twice as hard to mine the same amount of Bitcoin without a corresponding doubling in Bitcoin's price. This has led to a notable decline in Riot's Bitcoin production, down 45% year-over-year in June 2024. Despite the bullish long-term outlook on Bitcoin, Riot's financial health and operational inefficiencies present considerable risks to investors. I believe this strategy of investing in a Bitcoin miner that consistently issues will not be as lucrative for investors as investing in straight Bitcoin. The company’s valuation metrics, particularly their high price-to-sales ratio, suggest that the stock is significantly overvalued compared to their peers. I believe that with the company's recent performance, I do not think they are well positioned to recover in the long run (I do not see what part of their strategy will lead them to be long run profitable). Given the lack of a clear path to profitability, the ongoing dilution risks, and the operational challenges post-halving, I now believe Riot is a strong sell.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4704063-riot-platforms-miner-capitulation?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31015603.jpeg

The recent upgrade, Dencun, significantly reduced gas fees on the Ethereum network, leading to a bullish trend. Bullish trends for Ethereum include the rise of DeFi and increased institutional adoption, with significant assets held in DeFi protocols. ""The Ethereum Machine"" has outpaced ETH's price in recent months and is giving investors a current buying opportunity. Introduction Since its inception in 2015, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has emerged as the most powerful contender to Bitcoin, securing the position of second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. Recently, Ethereum has been upgraded and is showing improvements, yet the price has recently fallen from 6-month highs. Data by YCharts Ethereum's all-time chart still looks monstrous, for reference. We are not only below those 6-month highs by a fair bit, but we are also still far below the 2022 highs. Data by YCharts We have a long way to go too if ETH is to return to those dizzying highs back in 2022. Data by YCharts ETH is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a decentralized platform that helps developers build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (""dApps""). This makes Ethereum different than what most people think of as a currency, and expands its use case beyond simple payment transactions. There is a ""dApp"" for everything, and the largest names are all financial services and marketplaces. I say ""largest names,"" but that's relative to cryptocurrency. There are no decentralized banks with a reputation the size of Bank of America ( BAC ). Very famously, most of the dApps that allow individuals to own and trade NFTs are also hosted on the Ethereum network. Figure 1 (Glowid IT) The Last Upgrade Was a Success Vitalik Buterin, one of the key developers and the face of Ethereum, published this roadmap earlier this year to his X account, showing the trajectory for Ethereum moving forward. Note that it is a little technical, so don't dwell on it too much if you're missing some context. The point here is that active development is still ongoing and the founder is still very actively involved in the project. Figure 2 (Vitalik Buterin) Back in March, we began ""The Surge"" part of Vitalik's plan, with a new upgrade to the network, Cancun-Deneb (""Dencun""). That update launched this new phase, and Ethereum has been fairly flat since, with an almost 10% decline since then. Although in classic cryptocurrency fashion, ETH has been to +12% and -12% in that same timeframe. Data by YCharts Gas Fees are Down Dencun was supposed to fix one of the core problems with Ethereum, its use expenses, colloquially known as ""gas."" It worked wonders, with ETH's gas fees now down 88% since Dencun's launch. Data by YCharts We've seen the gas prices fall, even when the average transaction volume stays the same. This is a very good sign for the network. Data by YCharts Over the last few months, we've seen a de-coupling of the correlation between these two figures, which is a very bullish sign to me. One of the major issues with cryptocurrency adoption is dynamic, high usage fees. Addressing this, and keeping fees depressed even during periods of extremely high usage, will be a massive boon for Ethereum that will help drive broader adoption. Data by YCharts Gas may be leaving all together for some transactions, with news about gas-free stablecoin transactions coming to the Ethereum chain later this year to challenge centralized systems like PayPal Holdings, Inc. ( PYPL ) PayPal USD ( PYUSD-USD ) and Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN )'s agreement with Circle to have fee-less USDC ( USDC-USD ) transfers. This would be a huge boon for Ethereum, as one of the factors that majorly hinders adoption is the associated fees with making transfers and payments. The Market Disagrees With Me on Dencun Since Dencun, the price has actually fallen. Data by YCharts I believe there are several reasons for this. The most major is that Ethereum's market share was eroded by the rise of other competing currencies like Solana ( SOL-USD ), which is being billed by some analysts as an ""Ethereum Killer"" . In the same timeframe, since Dencun's launch, SOL has remained positive and outperformed Ethereum at every step. Data by YCharts SOL, however, is entering overvalued territory compared to Ethereum, as it has also outperformed Bitcoin and the broader market in this timeframe. Its outperformance is part of a broader correction in SOL since the FTX collapse , where SOL was particularly impacted as the fall of FTX took down one of its largest dApps. Be wary of currencies marked as ""Ethereum killers"" like SOL. In the last ten years of following the crypto industry, I've learned not to trust any cryptocurrency given that title. It's a curse. Data by YCharts DeFi Continues to Grow and Dominate DeFi is the platform fulfilling one of cryptocurrency's greatest promises: banking the unbanked. DeFi is designed to provide financial services over the blockchain. This allows anonymous usage of these services, as well as a way to curtail governmental or centralized power over finance. How well that actually works is a story for another article. For now, all that's important is that we see how large some of these institutions are and how fast they are growing. There are currently six DeFi protocols with over $30B in assets built on the Ethereum network, with the largest, Synthetix, having over $370B in assets . Of those, $205M are locked in contracts and are not liquid. Protocols like Balancer ( BAL-USD ), which is used to facilitate market making in currency pairs (i.e. currency exchanged called ""liquidity pools""), churned through a volume of $80B in the last 30 days . To be clear, Synthetix has a larger amount of deposits than Goldman Sachs Bank ( GS ), which sits at $363B as of the end of March . Note: this comparison is a little unfair as Synthetix's AUM is calculated using all assets, including speculative assets, whereas Goldman's AUM is just cash deposits and does not include the investments they manage. The largest decentralized exchange by number of active users, Uniswap V3, transacts about $2B Ethereum every day across tens of thousands of users. Figure 2 (DappRadar) This is a major selling point for Ethereum, as it shows just how important DeFi is to its ecosystem and how much money actually flows through it. Its 30 day dApp volume exceeded ten times that of the next-closest ""layer one"" (""L1"") cryptocurrencies. We can also see how far and away ETH is when it comes to NFT volume and number of contracts (i.e. variety of services) when compared to other major cryptocurrencies like BNB ( BNB-USD ) and Solana ((SOL-USD)). Figure 3 (DappRadar) What's Next? ""The Merge"" happened in 2022, which was when Ethereum changed their protocol from proof-of-work (the way Bitcoin validates blocks) to proof-of-stake, which was supposed to lower the energy input required to run the Ethereum Virtual Machine and make the entire system cheaper, while rewarding those who held very large amounts of Ethereum rather than those who controlled the most computing power. This was supposed to be a very positive catalyst for Ethereum, and while I believe this move was good for the whole network, this has shifted the ETH/BTC ratio down, and as the down shaded areas show, BTC has outperformed since. Figure 4 (Glassnode) But as we've seen in the past, following BTC outperformance is typically periods of Ethereum outperformance (and they are typically longer). This could come from several other catalysts that I believe investors should watch out for and could very positively impact Ethereum's price and help it catch back up again, back to the pre-merge ratio with BTC. Spot ETFs for Ethereum are in the works, with Fidelity already having launched a fund in Canadian markets, the Fidelity Advantage Ether ETF ( FETH:CA ) and filing to launch one in the US back in May This was a very positive catalyst for Bitcoin, which outperformed Ethereum since its spot ETFs launched Many speculators may see these spot Ether ETFs as a proxy for investing in Web3 without idiosyncratic company risk Ethereum was recently given tacit government approval when the SEC closed its investigation without filing any charges last month This has established the current legal status of Ethereum. Its status as a security is still contested, which is a positive catalyst for the stock moving forward as it means that the SEC might stay more hands-off It is to note that the SEC uses the controversial Howey Test for determining what is and is not a security, and they have not ruled definitively on Ethereum New upgrades still being added and utilized by dApps such as the recently-added restaking, which allows smaller blockchains to utilize the Ethereum Virtual Machine and leverage its power (while having to buy Ether to use as gas for this operation to work) This is a positive catalyst moving forward as this is still very new and under-utilized by the broader cryptocurrency market currently and could cause a lot of buying of Ether once services that streamline the process for smaller chains are able to scale, such as EigenLayer Market sentiment has recently trended toward non-Layer 2 solutions like Solana ((SOL-USD)), but these currencies are now entering overvalued territory. Despite their outperformance, they were not able to capture equivalent market share of smart contracts usage despite their price rises Suitability I've presented a bull case for Ethereum, banking on the fact that it is at a relative low in price compared to previous highs, despite its performance and usability having much improved since those highs. However, this does not necessarily mean that investors should be leaping into ETH head first. All cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile, or at least have the potential to be, and black swans that could cause systemic shocks and shatters in the cryptocurrency community could go totally unnoticed in the rest of the investing world. It's important for investors to remember that their allocations to cryptocurrencies should be very small and purely speculative. I believe that traders and speculators should limit their total exposure to cryptocurrencies to 5% and under. Risk-seeking investors should consider a 1-2% allocation. Conservative and risk-adverse investors should not invest in any cryptocurrencies. Conclusion Ethereum is set to, despite its 35% YTD performance, potentially run back toward its previous highs so long as the current market euphoria continues. Its own fundamentals have improved, and its usability is better compared to 2022 and its older versions. Now that the system has improved and more money is flowing through it, I believe that Ethereum still has room to go. That being said, beware of volatility and speculate wisely. I would not recommend locking up your cryptocurrency with third-party exchanges outside of publicly traded Coinbase ((COIN)). I also would not recommend interacting with any of the protocols I mentioned in this article unless you have a robust understanding of cryptocurrencies beyond investments. I am considering an allocation to Ethereum, likely through an exchange or my own custodianship, while I wait for Fidelity (my primary broker) to release its spot Ethereum ETF .

Pertsev's lawyers were seeking bail to allow the Russian to prepare for his appeals process but the court said ""that continuing his detention does not obstruct his possibility to prepare his defense,” Keith Cheng, Pertsev's lawyers said according to the report.  Pertsev was found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch judge at s-Hertogenbosch court in May and handed 64 month prison time by the court. The verdict sent shock waves within the community leaving several outraged. The case has been described as the most pivotal legal case in crypto.

The losses likely represent ""sell-the-fact"" losses following Spain's victory in UEFA championship.  Spain is reveling in the UEFA 2024 soccer championship victory, but the national team's official cryptocurrency, the Spain National Fan token (SNFT), is unenthused.  On Sunday, Spain defeated England in the finals of the UEFA tournament, clinching a record fourth European Championship title as England's decade-long wait for a major tournament win continued.  Still, the SNFT token has dropped by 20% to $0.024 in the past 24 hours and had a market capitalization of $565,000 at press time, according to Coingecko. Meanwhile, leading fan tokens like the Paris Saint-Germain Fan and FC Barcelona Fan tokens traded 2% to 4% higher alongside a renewed upswing in market leader bitcoin's price.  The national team launched the SNFT token in 2021 in partnership with the Royal Spanish Football Federation and the Turkish blockchain platform Bitci. The token aims to enhance fan engagement and deliver a privileged experience for sports enthusiasts and investors.  SNFT's price swoon likely represents a ""sell the fact"" loss. Prices surged just over 70% to $0.03845 in the three days leading up to the final. According to a research paper, fan tokens generally tend to experience anticipatory gains before the tournament and slide following the event. The so-called ""buy the rumor, sell the fact"" phenomenon was observed in the fan token market during the FIFA World Cup of 2022.  That said, researchers are divided on the impact of soccer tournaments on the market value of fan tokens.  A 2022 paper by Mieszko Mazur and Miguel Vega studied the correlation between fan tokens and field performance. The study showed that team performance does not affect fan token valuation irrespective of the tournament, and it added that these tokens tend to be volatile.  ""Even though a high first-trading day return of 150% was found, in the long-term, fan tokens underperform major crypto benchmarks such as Bitcoin (BTC) and decentralized finance (DeFi) coins,"" the study said.  Meanwhile, another study showed bigger tournaments like the Champions League affect fan tokens due to the broader audience and high tournament prestige compared to the regional leagues.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/15/spain-national-fan-token-slides-20-after-uefa-euro-2024-win,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33ddf6ee15aa187ecdd023489343d06199553041-5394x3596.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This what Trump winning, or the expectation of him winning, entails: Bullish for Crypto because Trump’s administration might pursue supportive regulations for cryptocurrencies, fostering innovation and adoption.” #2 German Selling Exhausted The recent completion of a large-scale Bitcoin sell-off by the German government also contributed to the price recovery. Germany exhausted its cache of 50,000 BTC seized from Movie2k, completing its final transaction of 3846.05 BTC last Friday. James “Checkmate” Check, a leading on-chain analyst, remarked on the incredible strength of the BTC price on X, “Folks, Bitcoin just absorbed a 50k BTC market sell order in a few weeks. It dipped ~25%, in a very structured and orderly correction. Last time something like this happened was LUNA selling ~80k $BTC and price dropped from $46k to $25k, and soon after to $17k. Not the same.” #3 DXY Is Showing Weakness The weakening US dollar is probably another driver of BTC’s recent gains. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies, fell 1.8% over the last two weeks to a five-week low of 104. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Accumulate 71,000 BTC Amidst Price Dip – Details The expectation of an interest rate cut and the growing US government deficit, which reached $1.27 trillion year-to-date in June, have contributed to the dollar’s decline, pushing investors towards riskier assets like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. #4 Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Ends Joe Burnett, another noted crypto analyst, highlighted via X yesterday that a month-long period of Bitcoin miner capitulation is nearing its end, indicating a potential reversal in downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Historically, the end of miner capitulation has been associated with subsequent price increases. #5 Technical Breakout From a technical perspective, Bitcoin surpassed the critical 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a descending trendline this Saturday. This milestone can be considered a bullish signal among traders, indicating a possible end to the downturn that began in early June. At press time, BTC traded at $63,105.

42390759,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8ff3,1721022205,Bitcoin Retakes $62K as 'Trump Trades' Back In Vogue After Weekend Attack,"BTC tops $62,000 as Trump shooting boosts odds of election victory.  Yuan and Mexican peso trade weak, while Treasury futures point to higher yields.  Assets linked to U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump's probability of winning the Nov. 4 elections are seeing renewed volatility following an attempted assassination of the former president on Saturday.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has rallied 7% to $62,500 since the weekend attack, which has boosted the pro-crypto candidate's probability of winning the elections to 70% on Polymarket.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has surpassed the crucial 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a widely-tracked gauge of long-term trends and a trendline characterizing the downtrend from early June highs in a positive sign for momentum traders, CoinDesk data show. Trump-themed Polifi tokens, marking the intersection of politics and finance, have surged as well.  In recent months, Trump has reversed course and embraced crypto to outflank his rival, Joe Biden, and win over the supposedly single-issue crypto community, which is seeking a friendlier regulatory environment for the industry. As such, bitcoin and the broader crypto market have become bets on Trump's victory. The former president is committed to speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, on July 27.  ""The biggest fundamental news over the weekend was the Trump assassination attempt. Absolutely insane. This has improved the odds of a Trump presidency. Trump being the pro-crypto president should help galvanize the cryptocurrency bids,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in an email.  Elsewhere, the Chinese yuan (CNY) traded lower against the U.S. dollar as a potential Trump victory could mean higher trade tariffs. Early this year, Trump suggested revoking China's ""most favored nation"" status for U.S. trade and imposing tariffs of more than 60% on Chinese goods. The Mexican peso (MXN) also slipped due to Trump's terse relations with the Latin American nation during his previous Presidential reign.  Prices for futures tied to the 10-year Treasury note fell, hinting at higher yields as Trump's return to the White House would mean more spending, tax cuts, and higher budget deficits. Several investment banks are betting that potential Trump victory would steepen the presently inverted yield curve in the coming months. Historically, sharp steepening has led to broad-based risk aversion in financial markets.  Futures tied to the S&P 500 traded 0.18% higher as of writing, signaling a positive open on Monday even as Asian stocks dipped on the back of disappointing economic growth figures in China. The dollar index, which tracked the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, traded 0.10% higher at 104.19, according to TradingView.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/15/bitcoin-retakes-200-day-average-as-trump-trades-back-in-vogue-after-weekend-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7971ccd1bca4cfec2dca998b309975113b77b54-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
