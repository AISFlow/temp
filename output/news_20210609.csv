Of the remaining $25 million, $5 million was distributed to create The Bitcoin Endowment, a new fund working toward increasing bitcoin education and adoption in historically under-resourced communities across the globe, according to a company announcement.      The Bitcoin Endowment Fund’s first grant is to Black Bitcoin Billionaire, an organization working to get the Black community into bitcoin and create education focused on building wealth.

A second was to allow Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) (which offer responsible and affordable financial services to communities that have historically seen less investment) to increase their capacity to make loans to local small business owners. A final was to “enable economic empowerment by providing unbanked individuals with access to savings and other financial tools that have historically been limited to those with privilege.”      Both Square and its CEO and founder, Jack Dorsey (also the founder of Twitter), have been known to work at furthering educational opportunities around bitcoin as well as its adoption.

42387041,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWNxv,1623272266,DeFi's Curve Eyes More Tokens With White Paper for Version 2,"Curve is throwing down with Uniswap.      Curve, the decentralized exchange (DEX) for stablecoins, has released the thumbnail for how it will start handling pools of volatile tokens as it moves toward its second version.      In a white paper released Wednesday, Curve describes a model in which greater liquidity could be achieved on a pool of volatile assets by using a dynamic peg.      Curve's new version should be appealing to liquidity providers because it will offer much of the attractive liquidity depth that Uniswap has enabled without the active management it requires. On top of that, Curve offers the benefit of liquidity mining. Right now, Uniswap does not.      Curve has deployed this new model on a USDT/wETH/wBTC pool now live on Ethereum. The protocol has also deployed on Ethereum layer 2 Polygon, where it has wETH and wBTC available for trading with different stablecoins, also using the new model.      The white paper compares the new approach to Uniswap version 2.0, writing:    “We concentrate liquidity given by the current ‘internal oracle’ price but only move that price when the loss is smaller than part of the profit which the system makes. This creates 5-10 times higher liquidity than the Uniswap invariant, as well as higher profits for liquidity providers.”    While only one pool has implemented the new model on the world's second-largest blockchain, Michael Egorov, the CEO of the company behind Curve, confirmed the pool presages other such offerings to come.    How to think about it    The white paper is a heavy mathematical discussion Egorov wrote to help him sort out the specification while he built it, he told CoinDesk in an interview.      It helps to think about other automated market makers (AMMs) as a way of picturing Curve's system.      The leading AMM is Uniswap, meaning it's a smart contract that always has a buy and sell price for each token it lists.      Until its third version, Uniswap used a simple ratio of tokens in a pool to determine prices, effectively relying on arbitrageurs to move it back in line with the market as needed.      Curve carved a niche for itself as a place to trade stablecoins by creating a new automated trading model with extremely low slippage, even on very large trades.      Introducing pools of volatile assets whose prices may not travel in sync is a step change for the protocol.      All AMMs rely on liquidity providers (LPs), users who lend their assets to a protocol for as long as they want so the protocol can use those assets to make trades. LPs would profit for doing so by earning a share of the trading fees levied by the AMM.      Under Uniswap v3, liquidity providers were able to define the prices at which they were willing to trade. This was powerful because it allowed the AMM to have much more funds available within the prices people were likely to want to trade. Previously, a large trade could move an AMM so far out of line with the market that traders might trade less than they wanted.      The Uniswap v3 approach requires very active management on the part of LPs.      Curve v2 proposes automating roughly the same system.      Basically, it identifies an internal price peg based on trading on Curve and concentrates the liquidity around that peg. The peg can move, but it will only do so if moving doesn't cause liquidity providers to incur too much loss.      “You have some liquidity in a very narrow band and the rest in a very wide band, and you move the band around,” Egorov said.      Stablecoin pools will continue to operate as they have. This new model is only meant to enable Curve to expand into more kinds of pools.    AMM competition    Egorov expects that LPs will find Curve v2 compares nicely with Uniswap v3. Egorov said they basically do the same thing, but added that “if you try to LP on Uniswap v3, it’s very hard not to be losing money.”      Curve has $7.2 billion in total value locked on it now versus $6.4 billion on Uniswap, according to DeFi Pulse. It should be noted that Curve has an active liquidity mining program to incentivize participation and Uniswap does not.      Curve has had $124 million in trade volume over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Uniswap has seen $1.5 billion in trade volume over the same period between version 2 and version 3.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | UNI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/09/defis-curve-eyes-more-tokens-with-white-paper-for-version-2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/babfb8394fd2a7a8cf5937a0862b61ce48f28bf4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,418-$2,613 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin price popping    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was in the green Wednesday by 10.2% as of press time. The price was above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour moving average, a bullish signal for market technicians.      The price of bitcoin jumped from $32,557 at 02:00 UTC (10 p.m. ET Tuesday) to $36,890 by 17:20 UTC (1:20 p.m. ET) Wednesday, a 13.3% gain based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then lost a bit of steam, dropping to $36,278 as of press time.      Bitcoin traders appear to be ignoring potentially dismal news for crypto in China. That includes a shutdown order for miners in Qinghai province, the ban of some blockchain keywords across the country and arrests of more than 1,000 people for potential crypto money laundering.      In fact, on-chain data suggests that there is much less bitcoin dry powder on exchanges the past few weeks, as some crypto investors are clearly buying and scooping BTC into off-trading venue wallets.      “One signal in favor of continuation for the current bullish reversal is the amount of BTC seen leaving exchanges from an on-chain perspective,” said Sean Rooney, head of research for digital asset manager Valkyrie Investments. Exchange outflow throughout this recovery was the highest experienced so far in 2021, he said.    Bitcoin reserves dropping    According to data aggregator CryptoQuant, exchange holdings across major venues is down to $2.46 million, the lowest since May 17.      Rooney believes the pattern will need to persist for bitcoin to pop back above $40,000.      “This trend will need to continue to break through heavy resistance around $42,000,” Rooney added. “This bounce from oversold conditions was potentially aided by a much needed positive sentiment with growing hopes of adoption in El Salvador.”      Read More: It’s Official: El Salvador’s Legislature Votes to Adopt Bitcoin as Legal Tender    Dull bitcoin futures market    Since May 19, when futures open interest (OI) on the BTC market was at $12.1 billion, a bearish-to-sideways condition has developed in derivatives.      As of press time, bitcoin futures OI is at $11.1 billion, an 8% drop and a reversal from ever-climbing futures OI seen earlier this year. The figure reached an all-time high of $27.4 billion in OI on April 13, according to data aggregator Skew.      Smart money that usually places derivatives positions are sitting out now, noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quantitative fund ExoAlpha.      “Traders still have some doubts on where the market is heading, so leverage has remained relatively low,” Le Rest said. “Bitcoin breaking $40,000 could give the boost in traders' confidence to leverage again to power new highs in the crypto market.”    Ether fees at three-month low    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading at $2,561 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), a 2.3% gain in the prior 24 hours. The asset is above the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour moving average, a bull indicator for market technicians.      The price of using the Ethereum network, known as gas, has fallen to a three-month low, at 16 gwei median or middle price as of press time, according to data analysis portal Dune Analytics. Gwei is the smallest unit of account for ether, representing an increment of one billionth.      Peter Chan, lead trader at OneBit Quant, attributed the high gas fees to a war between competing automated trading systems for arbitrage opportunities in Ethereum’s decentralized finance, or DeFi, ecosystem. For example, on May 11, the median gas price was at 311 gwei, almost 20 times the level witnessed on Wednesday.      “There are no more gas wars between arbitrage bots now,” Chan said. “So even when the market is volatile, arb bots will not push up the gas price.”      Read More: Solana Labs Raises $314M in Token Sale Led by A16z, Polychain    Other markets    In the alternative cryptocurrency market, ExoAlpha’s Le Rest is keeping an eye on tokens associated with Ethereum competitors.      “Alternative chains are putting a lot of efforts to take DeFi market share,” Le Rest told CoinDesk.

42387018,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWM7R,1623270038,Coinbase COIN Stock Hit With ‘Underperform’ Rating by Investment Bank Raymond James,"Florida-based financial services company Raymond James initiated coverage of Coinbase’s COIN stock, giving it an “underperform” rating due to concerns that competition will drive down the company’s transaction-based profits.      In a note to clients on Wednesday morning, analyst Patrick O’Shaughnessy wrote that a lack of barriers to entry makes competition inevitable and the exchange’s revenue will consequently be reduced. It is COIN’s first “underperform” rating, according to data cited by CNBC.      According to Raymond James' definition, ""underperform"" means the stock is expected to underperform the S&P 500 or its sector over the next six to 12 months and should be sold.      “We don’t see a structural barrier to entry here and therefore expect significant pricing degradation over time, with growth in non-transaction revenues hard-pressed to offset this,” O’Shaughnessy wrote. Though the exchange is, in O’Shaughnessy’s words, “hyperaggressively working to expand and diversity its sources of revenue,” he sees price compression as inevitable.      Coinbase’s revenue is largely based on trading fees that are already notoriously high by industry standards. Though the exchange has a significant first-mover advantage, impressive earnings and a robust institutional arm, the declining price of COIN could be a sign that competition is heating up.    COIN's rocky debut    COIN went live at an opening price of $381 on April 14, up from a reference price of $250 per share set by the Nasdaq on April 13. The stock quickly pushed to highs of around $430 per share before closing at $328. Today, the stock is trading at approximately $225 per share.      Before the launch of COIN in April, analysts debated the firm’s $100 billion estimated valuation, with some saying it was undervalued and others claiming it was worth as little as $19 billion.      Increasing competition in the crypto trading space has given rise to low-fee exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges are also gaining popularity. This follows the same pattern that has been seen in the traditional financial markets, O’Shaughnessy noted, with retail-oriented apps like Robinhood booming in popularity and forcing legacy brokers to lower their fees. Declining revenues led to a wave of mergers in the traditional finance sector.      If the trend carries over into the crypto industry, a similar consolidation period could be on the horizon for crypto exchanges.      Though O’Shaughnessy did not set a formal price target for COIN, his note suggested a fair market value of approximately $95 per share.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/09/coinbase-coin-stock-hit-with-underperform-rating-by-investment-bank-raymond-james,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84701398c5d1dee640498209726685e09fbea453-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A daily average of $34.8 billion of bitcoin has changed hands in the first eight days of June, compared with the unprecedented $67 billion charted last month, based on data from CoinDesk Research. The June average so far is the lowest for any month since December.      “Traders have certainly lost the appetite for bitcoin in this uncertain market environment,” the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research wrote Tuesday in a report.      The drop in trading volumes could have implications for cryptocurrency exchanges, which derive revenue from handling the transactions. The big U.S. exchange Coinbase’s stock price is down by 31% since it listed on April 14.      “The big price crash in May and Elon Musk’s tweets really drove trading activity, making May a high-comp month,” said John Todaro, vice president of crypto asset and blockchain research at Needham & Company, referring to the CEO of Tesla.

A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. If that happens, bitcoin could enter bear market territory similar to what happened in 2018.      Previous death crosses resulted in additional price declines of 70% in 2018 and 47% in 2019. The death cross in 2020 occurred shortly after the coronavirus pandemic-induced market crash in March, which proved to be a lagging signal at that time.      “Speculative reports suggest that bitcoin could soon drop to $20,000 referencing the looming bearish cross of the 50 and 200 daily moving averages,” Stephen Kelso, head of markets at brokerage firm ITI Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      Bitcoin appears oversold on the daily chart and is up about 13% over the past 24 hours, marking the biggest gain in two weeks. Wednesday's price bounce occurred despite a slew of negative headlines from China including crackdowns on money laundering and mining shutdowns.      The looming death cross could limit upside moves. Resistance is seen around $40,000, which has capped short-term price rises over the past week. Although the sell-off from May is stabilizing, the longer-term technical outlook appears less bullish.      For now, buyers are defending short-term support above $30,000.

Less than 14 hours after securing approval for a bill to make bitcoin legal tender in the Central American nation, Bukele says he has directed El Salvador’s geothermal company, LaGeo, to let power-hungry bitcoin miners plug into his country’s volcanic resources. Connecting bitcoin mining operations with state-run geothermal plants could be a lucrative tie-up.      “I’ve just instructed the president of @LaGeoSV (our state-owned geothermal electric company), to put up a plan to offer facilities for #Bitcoin mining with very cheap, 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions energy from our volcanos,” the 39-year old president tweeted Wednesday.      He further pledged: “This is going to evolve fast!”      That may be the understatement of the year. El Salvador has already crowned bitcoin legal tender and pledged to spend up to $150 million buying its citizens’ unwanted coins. Both moves are unprecedented. And they’ve both happened since Saturday.      Just last night, as the bitcoin bill barreled through El Salvador’s legislature, which Bukele’s party dominates, the president, who has been described as authoritarian, spitballed volcanic mining for what he admitted was the first time.      “We're not thinking of [bitcoin] mining,” he told a Twitter Spaces chat hosted by bitcoin gadfly Nic Carter late Tuesday night, “but we can do something to promote mining, of course. And we have some right now thinking of it, I mean, I haven't thought of it – but right now thinking of it.”      The sudden thought he then thunk was this: El Salvador has hundreds of megawatts of untapped geothermal potential as well as a network of underutilized power plants. It's cheaper to plug right into plants than to transport the power elsewhere. An opportunity awaits.      “So probably somebody wants to set up a mining facility with cheap, clean, renewable energy, but just a thought – I just thought about it right now,” he said to the crowd of over 25,000.      The bristling speed with which that half-formed thought evolved into a formal action plan underscores Bukele’s grip on power. It also points to the economic potential of El Salvador’s sudden, and spiraling, bitcoin fling.      “Every day is going to be a new idea,” Bukele said last night.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/09/volcano-powered-bitcoin-mining-goes-from-twitter-idea-to-state-policy-in-el-salvador,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2290ebe912bef5575713a054e851da8ffa5d3753-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42387022,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWM9x,1623266032,El congreso de El Salvador aprobó el uso de bitcoin como moneda legal,"Con una supermayoría, la legislatura de ese país votó a favor de la adopción del bitcoin como moneda de curso legal en la madrugada del miércoles.      El Salvador reconoció oficialmente al bitcoin (BTC, +15,53%) como una moneda de curso legal.    Read this article in English.    En una votación realizada a primera hora del miércoles, la mayoría necesaria de la legislatura del país votó a favor de la propuesta del presidente Nayib Bukele para que el país centroamericano adoptara al bitcoin. El presidente tiene la intención de firmar el proyecto de ley esta noche o a primera hora del día de mañana.      Sesenta y dos miembros de la legislatura votaron a favor del proyecto, con 19 en contra y tres abstenciones.      En una conversación en Twitter en la madrugada del miércoles —organizada por Nic Carter de Castle Island Ventures y Coin Metrics—, Bukele brindó más detalles sobre su proyecto, presentado como un esfuerzo para impulsar la inclusión financiera en un país en el que sólo el 30% de los ciudadanos tiene acceso a servicios financieros. Según el presidente, los usuarios no tendrán que utilizar necesariamente un monedero del gobierno.      Bukele también dijo en la misma conversación de Twitter Space que el país está diseñando una nueva ley que otorgaría la residencia permanente a cualquier individuo que invierta tres BTC en la economía de El Salvador.      El proyecto de ley aprobado obligará a todas las empresas a aceptar bitcoin para bienes o servicios. Sin embargo, el gobierno actuará como un respaldo para las entidades que no están dispuestas a asumir el riesgo de una criptodivisa volátil, dijo el presidente.      Un fideicomiso que el gobierno establecerá en el Banco de Desarrollo de El Salvador para convertir instantáneamente bitcoin a dólares estadounidenses asumirá el riesgo de los comerciantes, dijo Bukele. Contará con unos $ 150 millones, agregó.      A modo de ejemplo, Bukele dijo que si una heladería, ahora obligada a aceptar bitcoin, no quiere asumir el riesgo de la convertibilidad y busca solo recibir dólares en su cuenta bancaria, podrá pedirle al gobierno el cambio de bitcoin a dólares. ""Por supuesto, también puede hacerlo en los mercados, pero puede pedir al gobierno que lo haga inmediatamente"", agregó.      El fondo fiduciario del Banco de Desarrollo vendería parte del bitcoin que recibe por dólares para reponer el fondo.      Por otra parte, funcionarios del gobierno de El Salvador se reunirán con el Fondo Monetario Internacional en los próximos días para discutir el plan.      Bukele también indicó que el gobierno podría promover la minería de bitcoin. El Salvador ya esperaba atraer a las empresas con exceso de energía geotérmica, y aunque el gobierno no está buscando específicamente a la industria de minería de bitcoin para cubrir esa necesidad, es uno de esos sectores que podría beneficiarse, dijo.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | REGULATION,"Nikhilesh De, Andrés Engler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/09/el-congreso-de-el-salvador-aprobo-el-uso-de-bitcoin-como-moneda-legal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77121c5bb762f72b32f1b734d62ecfb7c0e17c99-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387008,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWLw7,1623259184,Moving on From Good-Bad Crypto Dialogue,"May 2021 was tough for crypto, especially for bitcoin, which dropped 40% since its peak in March. Besides the wild volatility fueled by a crypto friend turned foe (and friend again?), we saw a Nobel laureate claiming that crypto is a Ponzi scheme supported by a mix of “technobabble” and “libertarian derp.” We also learned about another China’s nationwide crackdown on crypto mining, and the month ended with a call for banning cryptocurrencies to fight ransomware. Time to kill the beast? Not so fast.      First, bans tend to be ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst. From Prohibition to the ""War on Drugs,"" history is full of examples of bans that couldn’t be properly enforced and ended up creating perverse incentives that led to more, not fewer, problems. Slow down with the torches, then!    Marcelo M. Prates, a CoinDesk columnist, is a central bank lawyer and researcher. This essay also appeared in today's edition of The Node newsletter. Subscribe here.    Second, it’s unfair to paint cryptocurrencies as a source of evil and crime. After all, bitcoin is why we’re here talking about monetary alternatives, from stablecoins to central-bank digital currencies (CBDC). Crypto is proving that, with technology, different monetary arrangements are possible: Money doesn’t have to come only from the government or be limited to a sovereign territory anymore.      Cryptocurrencies and the monetary competition they bring should be welcomed, as they create incentives against monetary incompetence. Governments and central banks will think twice before engaging in monetary mischief if they know that credible crypto alternatives are readily available to anyone affected by poor monetary management.      More than that, Bitcoin’s proposal to transfer digital assets safely through the blockchain has inspired many to reassess how financial market infrastructures work to trade securities and settle payments. Even central banks, which are conservative institutions, started toying with and exploring the possibilities of blockchain and distributed ledger technology to process payments after bitcoin. Bitcoin’s influence on how we think about the modern monetary and financial systems cannot be understated.      When it comes to cross-border payments, bitcoin’s model offers by far the best solution. A bitcoin in a Canadian wallet can be transferred to an Argentinian wallet and then to a Kenyan wallet seamlessly and in no time because bitcoin isn’t attached to a jurisdiction or backed by any sovereign currency. As I’ve said in another column, the level of coordination required from governments to get a similar result with sovereign currencies may not come quickly, if ever.    Read more: Marcelo Prates: No Reason to Fear Central Bank Digital Currencies    Finally, even the claims that crypto is a nightmare for those fighting crime should be tempered. As few places take crypto for payment, crypto holders have to exchange their coins for some sovereign currency whenever they want to make everyday payments or traditional investments. With that, authorities can know how much money is flowing in and out of crypto and who is taking part in these transactions.      Except for fraud, like using stolen personal information or account credentials, crypto holders have two options when converting to or from sovereign currency. They can use an intermediary, like PayPal or Coinbase, which will collect information about the sender and the receiver of the crypto and the sovereign money. Or they can find someone willing to make the conversion directly, thus avoiding intermediaries and records.      To avoid identification, they’ll have to use good old cash instead of a bank transfer. From a law-enforcement perspective, therefore, the problem will be the combination of “unhosted wallets” with bags of banknotes, not crypto itself. If no cash were available, this unidentified transaction wouldn’t be possible.    Miners are intermediaries    The positive assessment doesn’t mean that crypto is a perfect solution – far from that. Take Bitcoin and its promise of a monetary system that doesn’t require trusted central counterparties to work, just computational power and advanced mathematics. Payments using bitcoins are processed and settled in a decentralized way through computerized nodes and miners solving mathematical problems.      But “decentralized” doesn’t mean “disintermediated,” as these miners are nothing but intermediaries operating between the payer and the payee to complete and record each bitcoin transaction. Sorry, Satoshi, but bitcoin isn’t peer-to-peer: it’s peer-to-miner-to-peer. If you want a true peer-to-peer type of money, try cash instead.      Similarly, saying that Bitcoin allows monetary transactions to happen without the need for a trusted third party doesn’t mean that the persons behind the computers used to keep copies of the blockchain records (nodes), make the payments system function (miners), or design Bitcoin’s software (developers) are irrelevant. Who these people are and how many of them take part in the network still matters.    Read more: Marcelo Prates - Into the Money-verse: Central Banks Under Siege in 2028    Consider, for example, the perils of a “51% attack.” If a person or group seizes more than 50% of the computing resources used to process and settle transactions, they can control how the cryptocurrency works from that point on – and even create and process fraudulent transactions.      Even without an attack or fraud, the people operating the cryptocurrency infrastructure and where the operations are happening also matter. Who controls the underlying software code of the cryptocurrency and how changes to the code are made can either build or erode trust in the cryptocurrency.      Sure, code developers have to convince a majority of nodes and miners to download and install each version of updated software for the change to be implemented. But if both developers and miners represent small groups of persons, decentralization and the need for consensus becomes just a mirage.      To wit, look at the news that some personalities established a “Bitcoin Mining Council” to promote their view on how Bitcoin should function. Despite the apparent good environmental intentions, a self-proclaimed “council” is a sign of centralization that goes against Bitcoin’s original proposition.      The conversation about crypto shouldn’t turn into a face-off between right and wrong or good and bad. Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, have shortcomings but aren’t a useless innovation or a public menace. A reasoned debate can lead governments to better understand when and how to regulate crypto and help the public avoid giving in to sirens’ songs and being scammed.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Marcelo M.

As of now, there are no laws that prohibit executives and employees of exchanges from trading crypto on their own platforms.      According to the FSC, officials from the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which operates under the FSC, met with the heads of Korea’s major crypto exchanges on June 3 to inform them of the updated decree.      South Korea’s updated Financial Transactions Reports Act (FTRA) requires all crypto exchanges to register with the FIU by Sept. 24, 2021. Registration isn’t a simple filing process, however. Exchanges must meet stringent conditions to have their registration approved. These conditions include acquiring partnerships with commercial banks and having their anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) systems approved.      Any exchanges that aren’t approved by the deadline will be shut down. The FIU has also stated that registered exchanges whose executives or employees are caught trading on their own platforms after the September deadline will have their registration status revoked.      Korea’s major exchanges have actually established company policies that restrict employee trading, but many of them will be rendered mute by the FIU’s new restrictions.      Upbit, one of the world's largest exchanges by volume, currently allows employees to trade on its own platform but they’re prohibited from touching any cryptocurrency that’s not bitcoin, ether or tether. All company employees are prohibited from purchasing or trading anything beyond these three cryptocurrencies, regardless of which platform they use.      Additionally, Upbit employees are required to report how much crypto they own and how much they profit from each trade. There is also an annual limit on how much they can trade, but this limit has not been publicized.      Bithumb, another major South Korean player, allows employees to purchase and trade new cryptocurrencies only within 72 hours after they’re listed on the exchange. It also prohibits trading during work hours. Bithumb also requires all employees to sign a statement saying they will not use company information and data for personal trading profits.      Should this ban be implemented, these exchange employees would still be able to trade crypto, but only on other platforms, not their employers’.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/09/south-korea-looks-to-ban-crypto-exchange-employees-from-trading-on-their-own-platforms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/699a4bd03732eb14f96697ab603751993ec69d3b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is the fifth round of a nationwide crackdown on money-laundering activities related to telecom fraud in China, dubbed “Operation Card Breaking,” according to a statement released by the Ministry of Public Security on its official WeChat account on Wednesday.      The most recent round targeted people that allegedly used cryptocurrencies to assist money-laundering activities. The Chinese police have arrested more than 1100 people and eliminated 170 criminal organizations, according to the Ministry of Public Security WeChat account.      Telecom criminals tend to use fake or stolen SIM cards and compromised bank accounts to launder their money through the traditional banking system. That has become more difficult since the Chinese police tightened surveillance on commercial banks and black markets for SIM cards and bank accounts.      Chinese police have been cracking down on crypto-related money-laundering crimes across 23 provinces and regions, including Beijing city as well as Hebei and Shanxi provinces.    China continues crackdowns    The State Council called for a tough crackdown on telecom fraud in October 2020. The Chinese police then started Operation Card Breaking. It has arrested more than 311,000 people and eliminated 15,000 criminal organizations, according to the Ministry of Public Security.      Executives from two of the largest crypto exchanges that provide services to Chinese investors were taken in by the Chinese police last year to assist in undisclosed investigations. OKEx founder Star Xu and Huobi’s chief operating officer Jiawei Zhu were under police custody for their over-the-counter trading services that were potentially involved in money laundering. Dong Zhao, one of the most prominent Chinese OTC traders, was also taken into custody by the Chinese police late last year.

42387002,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWLpp,1623252475,IBM Donates Code Improvements to Open Source Hyperledger,"The 110-year-old computing giant IBM (NYSE: IBM) said it has contributed significant code to the enterprise blockchain network Hyperledger, “one of the largest in its history.”      IBM announced Wednesday it has donated updates to the Hyperledger code and the underlying code for the IBM Blockchain Platform Console, an intuitive user interface that will form what is now the Fabric Operations Console.      The firm said it is also donating the code that supports token exchanges on Hyperledger Fabric and the Fabric Token SDK, as well as support for interoperability among different distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms.      Launched in 2015 by the Linux Foundation, Hyperledger is an umbrella project of open-source blockchains, which has received contributions from IBM, Intel, and SAP Ariba. By 2019 IBM had doubled the number of its employees on the technical steering committee of Hyperledger.      The IBM code contribution to Hyperledger Fabric is aimed at making the underlying software easier to use. IBM said that through the Fabric Operations Console, organizations will be able to access tools for managing governance.      In an interview with CoinDesk, Chris Ferris, CTO at IBM Open Tech, said this is a major contribution, “one of the largest in IBM history,” and the intent is to improve the usability of Hyperledger for all users.      “This means more developers in the Hyperledger community will be able to use it to build applications,” said Ferris.      He stressed that IBM is still 100% in the blockchain business despite recent reports the firm had slashed its blockchain team.    Support through Red Hat Marketplace    IBM also announced any Hyperledger Fabric users will now have access to support services available in the Red Hat Marketplace, which will include access to IBM Certified Images, Code Security Scans, Break/Fix Level three Support and 24/7 customer support.    Read more: IBM Ventures Further Into Crypto Custody With METACO, Deutsche Bank Tie-Ups    In 2019, IBM acquired the open-source software giant Red Hat for $34 billion. Right after the deal closed the firms posted surprising revenue growth.      “We are going to have a full support offering for Hyperledger Fabric. In the past, this was only available to IBM Blockchain Platform licensed users so this is different. Anyone can get support for the open-source offering through the Red Hat Marketplace,” said Ferris.      The Hyperledger Fabric support offering will be available in the fall through the Red Hat Marketplace and give the same level of Fabric support that previously was only available to IBM Blockchain Platform customers, said IBM.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/09/ibm-donates-code-improvements-to-open-source-hyperledger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53ac06899e0bf2b0b4b9cc2115da9abcfa3f5d78-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Qinghai is the latest coal-based crypto mining hub that is set to completely eliminate the industry. The news came on the heels of another crackdown notice against some crypto miners in Xinjiang and follows Inner Mongolia, which had previously imposed restrictions on miners.      The document was issued by Qinghai Industry and Information Technology Department, which is part of the provincial government.      The local government cited the central government’s concerns about high energy-consuming industries and environmental pollution as well as the State Council’s directive to maintain financial stability by cracking down on crypto mining and trading as the two reasons why they will eliminate all mining activities in the province.      China's bitcoin miners use a mix of coal and hydroelectric power to power their miners, depending on the season. The use of coal in particular has drawn attention from the government, which is seeking to reduce its carbon footprint.      The State Council of China, one of the highest government bodies in the country, told local governments to crack down on crypto mining and trading in May.      China’s government has been trending in this direction for a while. Inner Mongolia implemented regulations on energy-consuming firms in April, while Sichuan – another mining hub – indicated it may end a local energy policy of which miners had taken advantage.      Earlier this year, when a number of coal plants shut down due to accidents in local mines, bitcoin’s hashrate (a measure of how much computing power is securing the network) fell over 16%.      Bitcoin's price, which rose close to $4,000 over the past 24 hours as El Salvador recognized the cryptocurrency as legal tender, dipped slightly on the news.      The translated document can be read in full below:    The Qinghai government will prohibit any local authorities from setting up or permitting any new crypto mining projects. It will also close down all the current crypto mining operations in the province. The Qinghai government will strictly inspect and punish any projects that operate mining activities in the disguise of big data centers or supercomputing centers. It will bar any company from providing venues or electricity to crypto mining projects. The government will carry out follow-up inspections and randomly select companies for the inspections. It advises the companies to prepare for related paperwork and other support evidence in case of the inspections. Local authorities are required to give further updates on the implementation of these measures to the energy saving department of the Qinghai provincial government before June 20.

Rouhani made his comments at a meeting of the government's Economic Coordination Board on Tuesday about prices of essential consumer goods.      ""For legalizing the activity of cryptocurrencies and protecting people’s capital in this area, we must think of a solution as soon as possible and lay down and communicate the necessary laws and instructions,"" Rouhani said, according to a report on his official website. Investments in crypto are risky and ""unprofessional entry in this field should be avoided.""      Rouhani called for government agencies to ""cooperate with the media and cyberspace in the field of information, education and public awareness about this phenomenon and its instructions and laws”.      In late May, Rouhani ordered mining facilities to shut until Sept. 22 to limit the load they place on the struggling national electricity grid during the summer. The nation has been experiencing power outages, often blamed on bitcoin mining. The Ministry of Intelligence has been working to locate and seize mining farms operating without a license, according to media reports, and access to the power grid will be cut for non-compliant miners.

Also, the Ethereum 2.0 network received a record-breaking number of new deposits in May, indicating increased interest for and investment in Ethereum’s plans to reduce blockchain energy consumption through a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol.      Subscribe to the Valid Points newsletter here.    Pulse check: Deposits on Eth 2.0 hit record high  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    In May, the number of deposits for spinning up new Eth 2.0 validators increased 246% to a record-breaking total of 26,681. As of Tuesday, there are more than 160,000 active validators operating on Eth 2.0 and 6,700 pending validators queued for entry.      As the number of deposits has grown, so has the total ETH staked on the network. In order to be an Eth 2.0 validator, users must stake a minimum of 32 ETH, worth roughly $81,000 at the time of writing, to the network.      In dollar terms, total ETH staked on Ethereum 2.0 has risen from about $12 billion at the beginning of May to over $13 billion as of Tuesday. The deposits represent 4.6% of the circulating supply of ether, which indicates that the vast majority of ETH is used for other purposes outside of staking, such as market speculation, lending, trading and decentralized application (dapp) execution.      From May to June, total validators rewards have also increased by 10% from around 900 new ether issued per day to close to 1,000 ETH/day. The rewards issued on Ethereum 2.0 make up only a small fraction of the rewards issued on Ethereum’s proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, which are awarded to miners. Ethereum miners are anticipating a reduction in their total rewards in mid-July as a result of a code change to the network’s fee market known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559.    Read more: Valid Points: MEV on Eth 2.0: The Good, Bad and Ugly  Slashing events    Since the major incident in February that ousted 75 validators from the Eth 2.0 network, there have been eight new incidents of slashings reported. Slashings occur when a validator is heavily penalized and forcibly removed from the network for malicious behavior that goes against the rules of the protocol.      The malicious behavior of the past eight slashing incidents have all been attestation violations, meaning that the validators intentionally, but more likely accidentally, signed off on two attestations for the same block instead of one.      That can happen if a user is trying to maximize rewards by running the same Eth 2.0 validator using two different setups. When one setup goes down, the plan is to automatically boot up the other to minimize operational downtime. However, when both setups are accidentally running at the same time, this can lead to the validator being slashed.      Check out this Mapping Out Eth 2 podcast episode featuring Raul Jordan, the co-lead developer of Prysmatic Labs, to learn more about slashing events on Eth 2.0 and how new validators can avoid them.    New frontiers: Aboard the ISS    On Thursday, an Ethereum node was launched into outer space from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, and on Monday, the node arrived at NASA’s International Space Station (ISS) for installation.      It’s the fourth blockchain node to be put into Earth-centered orbit, also called low earth orbit (LEO), by cryptocurrency startup SpaceChain. In 2018, two others connected to the Qtum blockchain were deployed into the LEO. Then, in 2019, SpaceChain set up the first active bitcoin node on the ISS.      Speaking about the first Ethereum-enabled payload to be installed and activated on the ISS now in 2021, SpaceChain co-founder and CEO Zee Zheng said in a blog post, “Bitcoin and Ethereum represent the two biggest ecosystems in the blockchain industry. With Ethereum’s smart contract platform running in outer space, it enables us to fortify blockchain applications and transactions with enhanced security and immutability.”      Blockchain technology, which is traditionally run by computers on Earth, is vulnerable to sudden power outages due to severe weather conditions, physical theft and hacking. SpaceChain’s mission is to leverage the security and remoteness of space infrastructure to create a decentralized network of blockchain hardware that is immune to the same attack vectors as terrestrial computer systems.      Once installed, the Ethereum “space node” that was launched Thursday will be used to authenticate on-chain, multisignature transactions for digital asset management firm Nexus Inc.      “[Nexus] has a very diverse portfolio of enterprise customers, and basically, they want to keep their assets safe. They want to try everything to make it as safe as possible,” Zheng said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Our technology, that is our data transmission method, is very different and we generate multiple keys and have extremely remote and safe places [for them.]”      Outside of multisignature transactions, Zheng hinted at other uses for the Ethereum space node related to decentralization application (dapp) development and smart contract execution. Still, he insisted that activation of the node and further testing of it on the ISS will be needed before those other use cases could be explored further.    Space awaits Ethereum 2.0    Zheng also mentioned that the Ethereum space node wouldn't be able to directly support the network’s upcoming upgrade to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. In order to do that, given the current development roadmap for Ethereum 2.0, SpaceChain would need to launch an additional Beacon Chain node into space to run alongside the first Ethereum space node.      Zheng’s team at SpaceChain will still be tracking Ethereum’s forthcoming transition to PoS closely. If the merge to PoS is successful and the Ethereum network maintains high levels of security, as well as decentralization, Zheng believes that future blockchain-focused space missions could become more cost-effective in the long run.      “Energy is a huge factor in terms of a lot of space operations,” said Zheng. “So the less energy the node takes, the more potential launches we can do.”      However, Zheng is hesitant about whether a PoS blockchain can operate at “a very large scale without sacrificing security” and insists the SpaceChain team would need to see how the Eth 2.0 upgrade pans out first before directing resources toward supporting it.      “We identify ourselves as the integrator of space and blockchain. So we don’t know where the blockchain [industry] is going to go. In just the last three months, so much has happened,” Zheng said. “Whichever technology really advances the most, we’ll have a market for it.”      If proof-of-stake delivers on its promises, space awaits Ethereum 2.0.

During CoinDesk’s Consensus21 last month, she said custody rules in the U.S. should be updated to accommodate digital assets .      In the Financial Times interview, Peirce pointed out that self-regulation remains a “pretty effective” way to address digital assets, a comment the FT suggested exposes a split at the top of the SEC, as its new chair, Gary Gensler, looks to tighten regulation of cryptocurrency.      The SEC commissioner also defended what she called the “gamification” of capital markets seen earlier this year when retail traders used the Robinhood platform to drive up the price of shares of video-game retailer GameStop – a phenomenon that is under the scrutiny of regulators.      “Gamification is not necessarily a bad thing; making financial platforms more user-friendly is not a bad thing,” Peirce said. “Platforms like this should look like the other platforms in people’s lives.”    See also: State of Crypto: Federal Regulations Are Coming Into Focus",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/09/secs-peirce-warns-against-stifling-crypto-innovation,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42434518,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDvXh,1623233208,Bitcoin Jumps Most in 2 Weeks to $36K After El Salvador Passes Currency Law,"Bitcoin's price jumped Wednesday by the most in two weeks amid mounting inflation concerns and hopes for mass adoption after El Salvador's parliament approved the cryptocurrency as legal tender.      The cryptocurrency was changing hands near $36,500 at press time, having picked up from a bid near $31,000 late Tuesday. The price was up 9% since 0:00 coordinated universal time, the biggest gain since May 24.      Data released by China early today showed the producer price index (PPI), also known as factory-gate inflation, rose 9% last month, the biggest year-over-year increase since September 2008.      China's PPI typically adds to inflationary pressures worldwide because the country is a major buyer and supplier globally.      ""Rising costs everywhere, in particular in China, will be adding to global inflationary pressures,"" Dariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Crédit Agricole, told the Financial Times. ""I think we are going to live with higher inflation globally, and what's happening in China will contribute to that.""      That's bullish for bitcoin, which is widely considered an inflation hedge because the pace of expansion of its supply is reduced by half every four years.      Bitcoin is up about 12% over the past 24-hours, showing near-term resilience. ""The market is bottoming on bad news,"" wrote David Grider, strategist at FundStrat, in a newsletter published today.      China's Qinghai province has ordered all crypto miners to shut down based on government concerns about high energy usage. And the crackdown on money laundering intensified as Chinese authorities arrested over 1,000 people who allegedly used cryptocurrency to evade the law.      However, longer term, big gains may remain elusive for some time because of concerns that policymakers across the globe might increase interest rates or scale back liquidity-boosting asset purchase programs to contain inflation, a process known as tapering. Monetary tightening tends to dilute the appeal of the store of value assets like bitcoin and gold.      China is already sucking out liquidity from the system, as noted by Caixin Global. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy has come under fire in recent weeks, with many experts arguing that it is not appropriate amid concerns about rising inflation.      ""Concerns about the current policy stance of the Fed started with a few and is now turning into an avalanche of former central bank officials, economists, and market participants – and rightly so,"" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser for the German financial firm Allianz, tweeted.      Taper talk may escalate if the U.S. consumer price index, scheduled for release on Thursday, exceeds expectations. These concerns are here to stay, as Messari analyst Mira Christanto recently noted, and may keep the market from cheering other positive developments like El Salvador's bitcoin adoption.      El Salvador's parliament approved bitcoin as legal tender early Wednesday, mandating all businesses to accept bitcoin for goods and services. The move has raised hopes for widespread sovereign adoption.      Other nations, however, may choose to see how things pan out in the Latin American country before following its lead.

In an early Wednesday vote, a supermajority of the nation’s legislature voted in favor of President Nayib Bukele’s proposal for the Latin American nation to adopt bitcoin. The president intends to sign the bill into law later tonight or early in the morning.  Lee este artículo en español.  Sixty-two members of the legislature voted in favor of the bill, with 19 opposed and three abstentions.  Bukele provided further details about his vision, pitched as an effort to boost financial inclusion in a country where only 30% of citizens have access to financial services, in a Twitter Space conversation early Wednesday morning hosted by Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures and Coin Metrics. Users won’t necessarily have to use a government wallet, Bukele said.  Bukele also said in the same Twitter Space conversation that the country is designing a new law that would grant permanent residency to any individual who invests three BTC into El Salvador's economy.  The bill that was just passed will mandate all businesses to accept bitcoin for goods or services, but the government will act as a backstop for entities that aren’t willing to take on the risk of a volatile cryptocurrency, the president said.  A trust that the government will set up at the Development Bank of El Salvador to instantly convert bitcoin to U.S. dollars will assume merchants’ risk, he said. It will hold about $150 million in dollars.  “If there's an ice cream parlor, he doesn't really want to take the risk, he has to accept bitcoin because it's a mandated currency, but he doesn't want to take the risk of convertibility, so he wants dollars deposited in his banking account, when he sells the ice cream, he can ask the government to exchange his bitcoin to dollars,” Bukele said. “Of course, he can do that in the markets also, but he can ask the government to do it immediately.”  The Development Bank’s trust fund would sell some of the bitcoin it receives for dollars to replenish the fund.  Government officials from El Salvador will meet with the International Monetary Fund in the coming days to discuss the plan.  Bukele also indicated that the government may promote bitcoin mining. El Salvador had already been hoping to draw businesses with excess geothermal energy, and while the government isn’t specifically looking to the bitcoin mining industry to fill that need, it is one such sector that could benefit, he said.

According to the tax agency's Congressional Budget Justification & Annual Performance Report and Plan, the IRS has outlined a number of avenues that $32.3 million in additional funding will bolster the agency's crypto tax collection efforts.      These include expanding the use of specialized contractor support services provided by a group of cyber/crypto experts and building an internal dashboard for blockchain analytics.      If approved, the funding will also go towards hiring private sector expertise in applied analytics, cybercrime, forensic accounting, investigative support and related consulting services, according to the report.      The $32.3 million figure the tax agency is seeking forms part of a much larger budget request of $13.2 billion for the 2022 fiscal year, an increase of $1.2 billion, or roughly 10%, from the previous year.      U.S. President Joe Biden plans to inject $80 billion into the IRS over the next 10 years to expand the agency's enforcement staff and equip them with new tools to fight against tax dodgers.      The Biden administration also recently outlined several new crypto reporting requirements in a 2022 budget proposal, published last month.      The budget included two proposals that took aim at ""broker information reporting with respect to cryptocurrency assets” and a “comprehensive financial account reporting” structure for tax compliance purposes. The second proposal would require financial institutions to report data on user accounts transacting above a $600 threshold.

42434517,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDvVh,1623207706,New York State Senate Approves Watered-Down Bill Targeting Bitcoin Mining Emissions,"A brewing fight over crypto miners’ carbon footprint escalated Tuesday after New York state senators moved to effectively bar new bitcoin mining operations from plugging directly into the state’s carbon-emitting power plants.      The watered-down bill, which originally sought to freeze all “cryptocurrency mining centers” in New York for up to three years, heads to the State Assembly with a more tailored focus.      Now only prospective mining firms on proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum that seek to set up shop within carbon-producing electric plants would be blocked. At least one such plant run by Greenidge Generation is online in upstate New York, but because it is already running, it would appear to be exempt from the bill.      Senators also ditched a three-year sunset provision, limited its scope to new projects and existing operations that are seeking to increase their rig count, and beefed up calls to document miners’ statewide environmental footprint. They nixed any mention of “cryptocurrency” from the final bill.    Read more: Upstate NY Bitcoin Miner Greenidge to Offset Rigs’ Carbon Emissions    The amendments may signal where the broader fight over mining is going, however.      “The annual global energy use for proof-of-work authentication is equivalent to that of the country of Sweden and exceeds the energy consumption of all the global activity of major tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook combined,” the bill asserted.      With more miners coming to New York and existing operations like Greenidge’s upstate mining center seeking to expand, the bill said increased emissions from “proof-of-work authentication” could imperil statewide efforts to slash carbon emissions.      It also invoked a less-talked-about environmental downside of power plants: Their use of water to cool equipment could damage nearby aquatic life by raising the water temperature of lakes.      The bill states the following:    “The department shall not approve a new application for or issue a new permit pursuant to this article for an electric generating facility that utilizes a carbon-based fuel and that provides, in whole or in part, behind-the-meter electric energy consumed or utilized by a facility that uses proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/09/new-york-state-senate-approves-watered-down-bill-targeting-bitcoin-mining-emissions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e184df28fdd46a85c8e306379a74c848ed5e2b2d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bill, proposed by El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, will treat bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar, if adopted by Congress and passed into law, according to a Google translation. Bukele announced his intention to launch the bill on Saturday at the Bitcoin Miami conference with Strike founder Jack Mallers.      “In order to promote the economic growth of the country, it is necessary to authorize the circulation of a digital currency whose value obeys exclusively free market criteria, in order to increase national wealth for the benefit of the greatest number of inhabitants,” the bill said.      Under the provisions of the bill:    Goods may be priced in bitcoin  Taxes may be paid in bitcoin  Bitcoin transactions will not face a capital gains tax  The U.S. dollar will remain the reference currency for the bitcoin price  Bitcoin must be accepted as a form of payment by “every economic agent”  The government will “provide alternatives” to enable crypto transactions.    The bill noted that 70% of El Salvador’s population lacks access to financial services and said the federal government will “promote the necessary training and mechanisms” to allow the population access to the cryptocurrency.      The government will also create a trust at the Development Bank of El Salvador, which will enable the “instantaneous convertibility of bitcoin to dollar,” the bill said.      “[It] is the obligation of the state to facilitate the financial inclusion of its citizens in order to better guarantee their rights,” the bill said.      The bill was expected to easily pass through the legislature, after Bukele’s New Ideas party and allies won a supermajority in the Congressearlier this year.      Indeed, it received 60 out of a possible 84 votes within hours of being introduced. Late Tuesday, the finance commission of the legislative assembly granted a favorable opinion toward the bill.      Under the provisions of the bill, it will take effect in 90 days.      Read the full text below:      UPDATE (JUne 9, 2021, 04:30 UTC): Corrected a translation error in the sixth paragraph.

42434515,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDvRh,1623202580,"Major Law Enforcement Operation Busts 300 Crime Rings, Recovers Millions in Crypto","One of the largest law enforcement operations against encrypted criminal activities to date has seized millions in crypto and infiltrated more than 300 criminal syndicates.      According to a press release from the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) on Tuesday, the operation is part of a three-year investigation into criminal rings that involved the surveillance of 27 million messages via an encrypted messaging platform.      Since 2019, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in coordination with the Australian Federal Police, developed and covertly operated an encrypted device company called ANOM.      The company eventually grew to service more than 12,000 encrypted devices to more than 300 criminal syndicates operating in more than 100 countries, according to the release. Italian organized crime, outlaw motorcycle gangs and international drug trafficking organizations were also caught up in the operation.      ""Very few matters unite law enforcement like bringing to justice those who seek to do our citizens harm,"" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said. ""The FBI provided an encrypted communications platform while the AFP deployed the technical capability that helped unmask some of the biggest criminals in the world.""      The goal of the new platform was to target global organized crime, drug trafficking and money laundering organizations by offering an encrypted device with features sought by organized crime networks.      Features included remote wipe and duress passwords to persuade criminal networks to select ANOM's product over other encrypted devices on the market.      According to unsealed documents from the Southern District Court of California filed last month, more than 450,000 photos of the 27 million messages on ANOM devices were sent by criminals.      The photos provided law enforcement insight into conversations on other encrypted platforms discussing criminal activity, cryptocurrency transactions, bulk cash smuggling, law enforcement corruption and self-identification information.    Operation Trojan Shield/OTF Greenlight/Ironside    Law enforcement was then able to compile the evidence over an 18-month period before executing what has come to be known as Operation Trojan Shield/OTF Greenlight      The operation involved a number of large-scale law enforcement actions conducted over a series of days across multiple jurisdictions.      The FBI conducted the operation alongside the Dutch National Police and the Swedish Police Authority, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and 16 other countries.      Police raids occurred across Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom including Scotland, and the U.S.      More than 700 house searches led to the arrests of 800 indviduals from more than 300 criminal rings and to the seizure of eight tons of cocaine, 22 tons of cannabis and cannabis resin as well as two tons of amphetamine and methamphetamine.      Additionally, 250 firearms were seized along with 55 luxury vehicles and more than $48 million in various global currencies, including cryptocurrencies, according to the report.      ""Operation Trojan Shield and Europol Operation Greenlight not only reveal how transnational criminal organizations continue to exploit encrypted communication services for their own illicit gain but also show the commitment of the law enforcement community to develop innovative strategies to counter this activity,"" said Matthew Donahue, the DEA's deputy chief of operations.
