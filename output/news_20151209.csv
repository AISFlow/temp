42378473,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIjJ,1449701701,Blockchain Technology Explored at TechCrunch Disrupt London,"With blockchain technology enjoying buzzword status in mainstream finance and technology circles, it is hardly surprising that TechCrunch Disrupt London, held earlier this week, hosted a panel to discuss the potential of bitcoin and the blockchain.  Led by TechCrunch editor and Freemit CEO John Biggs, the panel consisted of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Blockstream CEO Austin Hill and Steve Waterhouse, partner at the bitcoin investment firm and hedge fund Pantera Capital.  The discussion, which touched upon various areas of debate, was first sparked by Biggs' questions about the possibility of separating bitcoin, the digital currency, from its underlying technology, the blockchain.  Private vs public blockchains  Hill, whose firm develops technology on the bitcoin blockchain, was first to answer, noting how the question rests on whether financial institutions ought to build their own private blockchains, or if they should use public decentralised ledgers such as the bitcoin.  With this in mind, Hill commented on how previous attempts to create decentralized protocols had failed in the past.  ""I was involved in the early 90s in a company that worked on this, we spent millions trying to build e-cash, and all of the previous systems ... they all failed because of a central concept, central trusted parties,"" he said, adding:  ""You had a single issuing agency and when that database or that agency fell apart then all of a sudden the tokens that they had certified or given value to by signing disappeared along with it.""  Hill also paid tribute to what the bitcoin protocol and the R&D behind it had done for the development of specialized chips as a whole, noting how the the digital currency's mining industry had propelled it ""forward three or four years"".  From a technical perspective, Hill explained how bitcoin served as a reward for participants in the network:  ""We have this massive capacity that's represented in the form of the global hashrate and the reason that people operate this massive decentralised trust machine known as the blockchain is because they are earning rewards in bitcoin.""  There are, he said, some instances in which issuing digital tokens in the form of a cryptocurrency is not appropriate, pointing to US dollars issued on a ledger as an example.  Buterin, whose Ethereum project oversees an open, public blockchain for decentralized applications, delved further into the debate, adding that, for him, the need to tie bitcoin to the blockchain rested on the types of applications that people were concerned with exploring or building.  ""Do you actually care about the currency?"" he asked. ""Is the issue being about the Federal Reserve being corrupt and you wanting to replace the Federal Reserve?""  Through the eyes of investors  Having already invested in various notable startups in the bitcoin blockchain space, Waterhouse said that Pantera Capital puts a greater focus on bitcoin's underlying technology.  ""We've tended to look more at this as a a technology, as an infrastructure and I think it is important sometimes to take a longer view ... I think that if you look at distributed networks, the Web, when it first, started off, it was not good for streaming real time video, but now we do it quite easily,"" he told the panel, adding:  ""As an investor, we've been looking at primarily what are the applications that are able to get out, in many cases being somewhat agnostic ... I feel like things will be compatible with the bitcoin blockchain. I think the banks are very excited about this space.""  Waterhouse went on to call for public attention to shift from how the blockchain could not only disrupt existing technologies but also potentially replace them. Instead, he urged the industry to consider the endless possibilities brought by decentralised ledger systems.  ""To me, it's not important to think which industries are going to die or what banks are not going to work out. To me, it's more interesting to think what are the new kind of things that you can start very easily because you have this open protocol of the network,"" he added.  Banking on the blockchain  The comments by Waterhouse on how banks are interacting with blockchain technology did not go unnoticed and resulted in further queries from Biggs about the extent to which they were actively engaged.  ""There are some that are way more mature in their development cycle. I know of a couple of banks that have more than 150 people working on blockchain technologies,"" Blockstream's Austin Hill said.  Picking up on a recent patent filing by Goldman Sachs for its own in-house settlement cryptocurrency, Hill added that the technology's potential goes beyond financial technology and banking, putting forward transactional insurance for the peer-to-peer economies as an example.  Finally, Hill concluded by alluding to the robustness of the bitcoin protocol, hinting future development is to be expected.  ""Frankly one of the best things bitcoin has done is that it painted a $1bn-10bn security bounty on the protocol which is out there, available to be stolen. So over the last six years, I don't there is a system that has undergone more peer review or stress testing than bitcoin, and that gives people a lot of confidence to then build on that as a platform.""

42378481,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIs7,1449684712,Grammy Winner Imogen Heap: Blockchain Tech Can Empower Artists,"British singer and songwriter Imogen Heap has discussed how blockchain technology could help empower musicians.  Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt London yesterday, Heap, a self-confessed technologist and Grammy Award winner, told the audience that a revolution among artists was impending and that smart contracts on the blockchain could transform the ways in which people in the industry interact with data.  She added:  ""We are at an amazing point in history for artists. A revolution is going to happen, and next year it's going to take over. It's the ability of artists to have the control and the say of what they do with their music at large. The answer to this is in the blockchain.""  Heap made headlines earlier this year when she released her song ""Tiny Human""and its associated data on the Ethereum blockchain at a special event hosted by The Guardian.  During her panel discussion, at yesterday's event, the singer also picked up on the issue of monetisation within the music industry.  ""The single biggest problem for an artist right now is payment. We need a fair trade industry,"" said Heap, adding: ""I would love to be part responsible for a fair trade music industry ... it [the blockchain] could spark up many new platforms and services that would enrich all of our lives.""

42378447,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iGJb,1449673212,Bitcoin World Sceptical About Claims Craig Wright is Satoshi,"The bitcoin world reacted with a mixture disbelief, open scepticism and aloofness at the latest claims that Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym of Australian Craig S Wright.  Wired published a piece fingering Craig Wright as bitcoin's anonymous creator. Gizmodo also named Wright in an article published two hours after Wired. Both publications relied, in part, on a cache of leaked emails during their investigations.  Since then Wright's home and office have been raided by Australian tax authorities, who say the actions are unrelated to the publication of claims that he is Satoshi.  While mainstream media commentators and observers lauded the pieces for their rigour, the bitcoin world appeared unconvinced that Wright is indeed the man behind the world's most popular cryptocurrency.    Wow. Wired’s Bitcoin creator scoop seems solid: https://t.co/VJjFzAhqsF        — Nicholas Thompson (@nxthompson) December 8, 2015    Jeff Garzik, who has communicated with Satoshi Nakamoto directly, produced a tweetstorm casting doubt on the Wired and Gizmodo claims, saying that he is ""reasonably confident"" that he has never met the bitcoin inventor in person.  Whistleblower group Wikileaks also issued a string of tweets saying that it refutes the claim that Wright is Satoshi.  The organisation said it ""assessed that Craig S Wright is unlikely to be the principal coder"" behind bitcoin's invention, based on Wright's views on PayPal and hacktivist group Anonymous espoused in articles he wrote in 2011.  Wright wrote an article in July 2011 at expert explainer site The Conversation saying that he hoped PayPal would not be hacked by groups like Anonymous, at a time when the payments company was blocking donations to Wikileaks.  In August, in another piece at The Conversation, Wright wrote:  Simply put, the model in place is one of freedom. As much as we might want to rail against the corporate structure, PayPal represents freedom far more than groups such as LulzSec and Anonymous ever will.  R/Bitcoin was abuzz over the sensational claims, although the mood was decidedly sceptical.

Popper tweeted that he was contacted by someone who wanted to ""dox"" Wright but that he didn't find the claims convincing at the time.  He said Wright's writing style didn't match Satoshi's understated and spare method. He also noted that Satoshi was a good speller where Wright, apparently, is not.    . @samfbiddle @a_greenberg Satoshi was understated + opted for economy in his writing (+ spelled well) That's where Wright doesn't match — Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) December 8, 2015            In a review of Popper's book, left on Amazon this September, Wright expressed his unhappiness about the ""assumption that SN must be a bloody yank"", and criticised the analysis of Satoshi's identity as ""too limited"".  Wright apparently wrote:  ""I enjoyed the parts from 2012 most. I did not know most of this as I was too focused on my own work and missed the outside growth.""  Perhaps the most succinct sentiment around the claims that a little known Australian man is bitcoin's creator was expressed by former Bitcoin Foundation executive director Patrick Murck, who tweeted:    Another day and I still don't care who Satoshi is        — Patrick Murck (@virtuallylaw) December 8, 2015      Question mark image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/09/bitcoin-world-sceptical-about-claims-craig-wright-is-satoshi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ef6cd88f01e2a3e4898999b554b48be1f307cb4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42378457,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iGSP,1449649646,Internet Pioneer Pindar Wong: Bitcoin Creator Shouldn't Be Penalized,"Internet pioneer and VerFi chairman Pindar Wong has issued an impassioned plea to authorities amidst growing speculation bitcoin’s creator may have finally been identified.  Speaking at the Finnovasia FinTech conference in Hong Kong, Wong addressed reports issued yesterday by Wired and Gizmodo that allegedly expose Wright as bitcoin’s long anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, as well as a separate piece by The Guardian that revealed police visited the 44-year-old Australian’s home on Wednesday.  In his brief remarks, Wong called for the global community to have sympathy for Wright’s situation, regardless of whether he is Nakamoto or simply the latest individual to be ensnared by the media’s quest to reveal his or her identity.  Wong told the audience:  ""I want to encourage us to get behind him as an individual for his invention. The only reason we’re having this discussion is because this individual innovated and he should not be penalized for his invention.""  The comments followed a panel session moderated by Wong that found the CEOs of regional blockchain industry startups, including Bitspark and Gatecoin, speak alongside executives from UBS and WIP Solutions.  Wong, who founded Hong Kong’s first commercial Internet service provider (ISP), has notably emerged as a unifying figure in the bitcoin industry due to his role in the Scaling Bitcoin conferences.  Held in Montreal and, most recently, Hong Kong, the workshops have sought to bring together the global bitcoin development community as it seeks to upgrade its technology in the face of increasing enthusiasm from investors and traditional financial incumbents.

42378467,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iGZx,1449647949,Alleged Bitcoin Creator Craig Wright May Have Lost Bitcoin in Mt Gox Collapse,"UPDATE (9th December 21:50 BST): This article has been updated with additional information.      Craig S Wright, the Australian entrepreneur identified in new reports from Gizmodo and WIRED as the creator of bitcoin, may have lost money in the collapse of now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, newly surfaced documents show.  A piece of the evidence cited by WIRED included a liquidation notice hosted on the website for corporate advisory firm McGrathNicol. The notice focuses on Hotwire, a venture of Wright's that backed a stalled attempt to create a bitcoin-based bank.  The document outlines the business venture's various aspects, financial details as well as reasons for its failure. Notably, it suggests that the firm failed, in part, due to Wright's exposure to the collapse and subsequent bankruptcy of Mt Gox.  The document states:  ""Dr Wright, as the major shareholder no longer being able to provide financial accommodation to the Company due to the collapse of the Mount Gox Bitcoin registry where we understand Dr Wright had a significant exposure.""  The document does not provide exact numbers for Wright's losses, which came amid the hundreds of thousands of bitcoins believed to have been stolen from the exchange.  Another reference to Wright's involvement with Mt Gox is contained within an unconfirmed transcript of a meeting with the Australia Tax Office published by Gizmodo. In addition to Wright, the meeting's attendees included ATO representative Des McMaster and attorney Andrew Sommer.  During the meeting, McMaster refers to ""issues overseas"" related to Gox. In the transcript, the exchange – mistakenly called ""Mount Cox"" – is allegedly holding funds belonging to Wright.  If the document is authentic, the meeting, which took place on 18th February, came just over a week before the Tokyo-based Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy.  CEO Mark Karpeles has been arrested twice by local police authorities, and faces embezzlement charges amid a widening investigation.

42378461,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iGWB,1449635949,Satoshi Nakamoto 'Unmasking' Might Be Driving Bitcoin's Price Rally,"The price of bitcoin is rallying once again, spiking abruptly by $16.50 across major exchanges on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) over a 15-minute period yesterday.  The movement began at 23:15 and ended at midnight UTC when the price hit a high of $418, with the largest movements taking place from 23:15 to 23:30.  At press time, prices were once again on the rise, pushing the digital currency's value to a one-month high of $421.83, its highest total since 5th November.  Experts were less certain about the reason for the price escalation, with theories ranging from the continued influence of activity in the global Chinese Yuan (CNY) market to speculations that the potential unmasking of bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto had calmed investor concerns about the digital currency.  Help from Satoshi?  Market analysts so far seem split on the cause of bitcoin’s latest price increase, with the rise in value following reports by tech industry news outlets Wired and Gizmodothat published new evidence that bitcoin’s enigmatic creator may be a pseudonym for Australian businessman Craig Steven Wright and US forensic researcher Dave Kleiman.  First published by Wired at 21:25 UTC, however, the news appeared online roughly two hours before the price increase. Still, some market observers believe that clarity on who is the owner of Satoshi’s roughly 1 million unspent bitcoins (worth approximately $465m at press time) could have had a psychological impact on the market.  “I think it is the Satoshi news because the articles describes how the 1.1m BTC allegedly are cryptographically locked up, only to be released by January 2020,” editor in chief at Adamant Research Tuur Demeester told CoinDesk. “I think the market is acting on this news, placing a bullish bet on this story being true.”  With 14.9m BTC in circulation according to data from Blockchain’s market data service Blockchain.info, Nakamoto's estimated holdings would comprise roughly 7% of the total global market supply.  According to Gizmodo, its sources provided the media outlet with a document of an unfinished legal contract that shows Kleiman, now deceased, would be given custody of the 1.1m BTC until 1st January 2020, at which point they would be repaid to Wright.  Notably, it also provides clarity on the conditions under which coins could be sold.  “The trust fund PDF signed by Wright’s late friend David Kleiman keeps those coins locked in place until 2020, yet gives Wright the freedom to borrow them for applications including ‘research into peer-to-peer systems’ and ‘commercial activities that enhance the value and position of bitcoin,” Demester added.  The documents, though unconfirmed, would nonetheless give market observers a new understanding of when the holdings may be sold on the market, providing clarity to an issue that has long been a source of uncertainty for investors.  China connection  Wired and Gizmodo weren’t the only news sources that could have impacted price, however, as influential alternative finance blog Zero Hedge published a story showcasing the connection between the bitcoin price increase and a decrease in the offshore CNY market.  The Zero Hedge piece correlated the $16.50 price increase with a 12 price interest point (PIP) decrease in the value of CNY against the US dollar. The blog suggested that it was seeing traders become increasingly interested in bitcoin and CNY and that they were moving against the US dollar.  BTCVIX, an organizer of bitcoin trading collective Whale Club, indicated that he believes this is the primary instigator of the increase.  “The rumors of continued devaluation have been ramping up in the wake of that IMF decision [to provide CNY special drawing rights],” he told CoinDesk.  With the move, CNY joined currencies including the US dollar, euro, yen and British pound in the international financial organization’s benchmark reserve currency basket, a move that was widely hailed as a sign of the country’s growing economic influence.  The view has been increasingly put forth by market observers, including former bitcoin derivatives exchange founder George Samman, who blogged about the potential price move as early as 30th November.  Blocksize debate  Other investors put forth the idea the price increase could have been connected to positive news from the latest Scaling Bitcoin conference.  Held in Hong Kong this week, the two-day event saw key industry stakeholders including developers and miners move forward toward consensus on how the network could be altered to handle more transactions per second, and thus better compete with other financial processing systems.  “I think the hard fork debate was weighing on the market,” Crypto Currency Fund manager Tim Enneking told CoinDesk.  The price increase follows growing enthusiasm in the development community for one of two proposals on increasing the blocksize – a change to how block size is calculated in the protocol called segregated witness and a static increase to 2MB.  Still, Enneking said it was likely the sum of factors as none of the possible options represented “radical news” events, concluding:  “These movements are rarely due to a single event – or so us pundits claim.”  Images via CoinDesk, Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/09/satoshi-nakamoto-unmasking-might-be-driving-bitcoins-price-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d37e470999353331bbee0e95b772f19bbfa1c607-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378459,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iGTf,1449635466,Reports Claim Satoshi Nakamoto Might Be 44-Year Old Australian,"New reports by Wired and Gizmodo may have identified the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, as Australian entrepreneur Craig S Wright.  WIRED  cites ""an anonymous source close to Wright"" who provided a cache of emails, transcripts and other documents that point to Wright's role in the creation of bitcoin. Gizmodo cited a cache of documents sourced from someone claiming to have hacked Wright’s business email account, as well as efforts to interview individuals close to him.  The news outlets further claimed that Dave Kleiman, a computer forensics expert who died in April 2013, played a significant role in the creation of bitcoin. According to Gizmodo, Kleiman ""seemed to be deeply involved with the currency and Wright’s plans"" and may have a significant supply of bitcoins given his early role.  It should be noted that, in WIRED’s case, the evidence was presented with caution that the information might be made up – perhaps even by Wright himself.  Greenberg and Branwen write:  ""And despite a massive trove of evidence, we still can’t say with absolute certainty that the mystery is solved. But two possibilities outweigh all others: Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he’s a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.""  The idea that the Wright-Satoshi connection is nothing but a hoax has been floated by other observers, though the compelling nature of the evidence published by both Gizmodo and WIRED will no doubt fuel speculation for some time to come.  But who is Wright exactly? A LinkedIn account attributed to Wright remains active at the time of writing, detailing work with a series of companies including Hotwire Pre-Emptive Intelligence Group – the firm behind an effort to create a bitcoin-based bank called Denariuz. That effort later ran into problems with the Australian Tax Office (ATO).  According to a presentation for the company published in June 2014, Denariuz aimed to become ""among the second tier banks in Australia within 5-6 years"".  Gizmodo traced the connection between Wright and the ATO further, suggesting that Wright invoked his involvement in bitcoin's development during a meeting with agency officials.  Further, the LinkedIn post suggests that Wright had a working relationship with representatives from various agencies within the US government.  As part of work with a firm called the Global Institute for Cyber Security + Research, in a capacity as vice president and director for Asia-Pacific, Wright was responsible for fostering ""executive level relationships with the National Security Agency (NSA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), North American Space Administration and DSD and regional government bodies"".  Whether he is Satoshi or not, Wright appears to have taken efforts to reduce his online visibility by deleting his Twitter account, a move that came after the account was set to private. Gizmodo reported that the tweets were set private during its investigation.  Wright did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A US phone number attributed to Wright in an email sent by him to CoinDesk in May did not connect when reached.
