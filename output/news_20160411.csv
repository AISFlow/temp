42426777,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwddh,1460410269,MUFG Building Blockchain Proof-of-Concept for Promissory Notes,"Blockchain startup Chain has inked a new deal with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), a partnership that will initially see the two firms working on a blockchain proof-of-concept focused on the exchange of promissory notes.  A promissory note is an agreement under which one party promises to pay another at a certain date and time (or on demand) at a specified price. Chain and MUFG will work on a platform for the digitized exchange of promissory notes  Chain said in a blog post detailing the partnership:  ""The platform simulates an environment where businesses instantly and securely issue, transfer, sell and redeem promissory notes in a natively digital medium, with lower costs and risks for counterparties over traditional methods. The solution is designed to give businesses the privacy and confidentiality they require, while at the same time providing transparency to regulators and auditors.""  MUFG, one of a number of global banks working as part of the R3CEV-led blockchain consortium, has been conducting internal tests of the technology for some time.  Past uses cases include peer-to-peer transfer and remittances.  “We are pleased to be working with Chain to explore the application of next-generation financial infrastructure that we believe could significantly enhance the experience for our clients,"" Satoshi Murabayashi, MUFG’s CIO for digital, said in a statement.  Chain raised $30m in a Series A round last fall from a number of major financial including Capital One, Fiserv and Visa, and has developed a private blockchain securities market platform, dubbed Linq, in partnership with global stock market operator Nasdaq. The firm used Linq late last year to issue shares to a private investor.  In announcing the MUFG partnership, Chain suggested that it could work with the financial group on similar projects, indicating that it would focus on issues related to “market infrastructure”, in addition to other areas.

42426775,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdZh,1460401291,Ripple Hires SWIFT Board Member to Take Over Global Accounts,"Distributed ledger tech startup Ripple has hired SWIFT board member Marcus Treacher as its global head of strategic accounts.  Treacher has held a position as one of SWIFT’s more than 20 board members since 2013, where his responsibilities include overseeing its corporate advisory group and serving as a member of its banking and payments committee and technology committee.  Until November 2015, Treacher was also global head of payments innovation at HSBC. Now, Treacher will be working from the headquarters of Ripple’s European operations in London.  In a press release, Ripple lauded Treacher as a driver of blockchain and distributed ledger adoption during his tenure at HSBC.  Treacher said in a statement:  ""Since the early days of the web, I’ve been exploring how new technology can impact and improve banking. Ripple stood out to me as a company that has both the vision and the expertise to truly transform the future of banking and payments.""  In remarks, Ripple CEO Chris Larsen went on to laud Treacher for his experience working to improve global payment systems.  The appointment is notable given past assertions by FinTech thought leaders that blockchain technology could one day come to challenge SWIFT’s position in the global financial system.  Founded in the 1970s as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT promotes and develops standards or financial messaging.

42426784,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJwdph,1460398216,How R3 and Major Banks Are Building a New Kind of Distributed Ledger,"Banking consortium R3CEV held a workshop with members last week to discuss the next steps toward completing and implementing a recently unveiled distributed ledger project.  The meeting, scheduled for New York City, was the latest in a series of workshops held around the world between R3 and representatives of its 43 consortium members, a group that also includes Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and others.  But, the meetings are just part of a bigger plan by R3 to build Corda, a new distributed ledger designed to help banks honor a wide range of agreements between one another.  Charley Cooper, managing director of the consortium, said in interview that while blockchain tech may haven inspired Corda, the way it is being constructed and tested is fundamentally different.  He told CoinDesk:  ""From the very outset when we launched the consortium the plan was to do so in such a way that more than appeared to act collaboratively — that we constructed a governance that contributed to actual team work.""  Organizing the complexity  Founded in 2014, R3 rapidly rose to prominence in the blockchain and distributed ledger industry with the announcement it had partnered with nine global banks to explore and develop distributed ledger applications last September.  To manage a group of several dozen banks – and to increase the likelihood that those involved might actually be served by a technology some said had the potential make them redundant – R3 originally divided the project into three working groups, focused on architecture, use cases and legal and regulatory issues.  Each group was comprised of participants drawn from both the ranks of member banks as well as R3's staff.  ""On any given week, on any given month, there’s needs that come up. We put in the room with them our senior guys from research and elsewhere,"" Cooper explained, adding:  ""It's not us talking at them, its us talking to each other and working through concrete problems. This is not some kind of lecture series.""  It was through a combination of globe-trotting workshops, the creation of a Wiki to share information, support documentation and, most notably, the results from experiments, that the banks were able to work towards a consensus on what kinds of technology would address their specific needs.  The learning process  Initially, Cooper and the early employees of R3 divided their options for capitalizing on the technological advancements of blockchain into three categories.  ""Adopt, adapt or build,"" he said, became a kind of unofficial motto. “The key word being, ‘or’.""  If a third-party's solution didn't exist, they would build one. But as the consortium grew, that clarity began to blur.  A fourth and fifth group was added to the original three working groups.  A collaborative lab was created, complete with computer scientists decked out in white lab coats emblazoned with the R3CEV logo. This lab was designed specifically to find a ""unified approach"" to counter what the team perceived as a hitherto ad hoc environment of experiments being conducted elsewhere in the financial industry.  The lab, which was originally intended to be a sandbox environment for experimentation, ended up becoming what Cooper describes as a ""critical"" component of the business model and served as a foundation that connected the other working groups together.  During lab experiments, present in the room or remotely are a collection of computer specialists, architects, business experts and legal gurus to provide feedback and troubleshoot as banks around the world launched their nodes for hosting the network.  ""We can see on a screen when each of the nodes goes live,"" said Cooper. ""If the node didn’t work, scientists can walk them through.""  A fifth group, the research team, which was also added later, is frequently plugged in remotely or actually in the room to collect feedback for their own analysis of how the banks act on the network.  Cooper said:  ""What we ended up getting to is it’s not adopt, adapt or build, but all three.”  Dealing with the competition  Ranging from another consortium, to an established player partnering with another blockchain startup, there’s no shortage of interested parties that some might view as potential competitors.  Hyperledger is a consortium of both banking and non-banking companies, of which R3 is also a member. In recent months JPMorgan Chase and Intel have both unveiled their own distributed ledger efforts at Hyperledger meetings.  The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which currently conducts a wide-range of transactions totaling $1.6qn, has partnered with Digital Asset Holdings for its own post-trade trial of the technology. Further, he DTCC recently positioned itself more broadly with a conference that served as a showcase of its expertise.  However, in the end, Cooper told CoinDesk there's room in the industry for more than one solution.  ""We do not believe that this industry is heading in the direction where there will be one blockchain and one distributed ledger that takes over the world.""  Over the coming months R3CEV plans to continue to work with its partners to improve the service, and to release the core of the Corda platform as open-source contribution.

42398987,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhppU,1460390417,Ethereum Used for ‘First’ Paid Energy Trade Using Blockchain Tech,"Two Brooklyn residents used the Ethereum blockchain today to facilitate a transaction that let one sell energy directly to the other.  The neighbors accomplished the exchange thanks to LO3, a green energy startup working to do to the energy industry what blockchain is already doing to banks.  LO3 co-founder Lawrence Orsini said that the exchange is designed to demonstrate how everyday people can use blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer exchange.  Orsini told CoinDesk:  “All the projects that we’re working on are squarely focused on the emerging distributed economy, peer to peer concepts. They’re all squarely focused on distributing and decentralizing assets into communities, into people’s hands, the new economy of the future.”  A new kind of partnership  The joint effort called TransActive Grid, struck between between LO3 and decentralized applications startup ConsenSys, allowed Brooklyn resident Eric Frumin to sell excess renewable energy generated from his own solar panels directly to Bob Sauchelli, a former program manager at EnergyStar, a government-backed green energy initiative.  Every unit of energy created by Frumin is being counted and logged on the Ethereum blockchain. Programmable smart contracts are then used to make those units of energy available for sale on the open market. Today, 195 credits were purchased for $0.07 each.  As the power grid is typically set up in his neighborhood Frumin was able to off-set his own energy-consumption with a series of solar panels on his rooftop in Brooklyn. But any excess energy he generated has to be sold back to the power company at a wholesale price.  Sauchelli told CoinDesk:  “With this arrangement, I’m going to pay him the whole premium, it won’t cost me anymore. I’m going to pay him what I’d pay the power company, but he’s going to get the whole premium, not just the wholesale rate.”  This last point was pivotal to Sauchelli’s decision to get involved, he told CoinDesk. While it’s important to him to buy green energy, he said the actual purchase should be as easy as if he were buying from the traditional power company or another green alternative.  Joseph Lubin, co-founder of TransActive Grid and ConsenSys, elaborated further on this point.  “The electric power industry is decentralizing globally due to cheap photovoltaics and raised consumer and regulator consciousness about the efficiency, brittleness and vulnerability of power delivery,"" he said. ""But still, until now, people have never been able to upload electrons to the grid and sell them to the guy across the street.""  Ready to expand  Currently, environmentally conscious energy consumers can buy what are called Renewable Energy Certificates from for a premium, that are then used to support the creation of green energy elsewhere around the world.  But with TransActive Grid, and another project of the LO3 initiative, Brooklyn Microgrid, that energy — and money — stays local.  “We’ve got five people in Brooklyn that are producing renewable electrons today and putting them on the grid, on a piece of copper that is connected to a house,"" Orsini told CoinDesk, who added:  ""The odds of those electrons making it to a neighbor are far higher that electrons that are produced in Nebraska. In fact, they’re not going to make it here from Nebraska.""

42398975,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpef,1460386817,"Amid Blockchain Securities Push, Overstock CEO Takes Medical Leave","Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne announced today that he will take a medical leave of absence from the online retail giant.  Revealed in a letter to shareholders, the move comes as the online retailer moves ahead with plans to launch a blockchain-powered securities exchange, dubbed tØ.  Overstock has spent millions on that initiative, and the firm recently indicated its intention to issue its own stock on the platform in the future. Byrne himself has become a noteworthy advocate for the emerging technology since the online retailer first started taking bitcoin payments in 2014.  Byrne said in the letter that treatment related to a diagnosis of hepatitis C, an infectious disease that targets the liver, is the primary driver behind the ""indefinite"" leave.  Byrne has recommended that Overstock special counsel and senior vice president Mitch Edwards serve as acting chief executive.  In the letter, Byrne suggested that Edwards would be well-suited to continue spearheading the firm's blockchain efforts, stating:  ""Mitch is an outstanding full-spectrum entrepreneur who has serving as our general counsel for six months and has learned our business, and understands our t0 efforts to revolutionize the capital markets.""

42398983,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhphc,1460379651,How Close Are Smart Contracts to Impacting Real-World Law?,"Josh Stark is a lawyer and head of operations and legal at Ledger Labs, a blockchain consulting firm and development group.  In this opinion piece, Stark focuses on ""smart contracts"" as an alternative form of legal agreement, speculating on how they could come to impact his industry.  Over the last year, the concept of a ""smart contract"" has received renewed attention in legal and business circles.  Advancements in blockchain technology have led some to believe that smart contracts could soon offer alternatives to traditional commercial and financial agreements, with dire results for the legal and financial sectors. While this enthusiasm may be premature, the legal profession nonetheless remains mostly unaware of this important emerging technology and the long-term implications for their profession.  In this context, ""smart contract"" refers specifically to the use of computer code to articulate, verify and execute an agreement between parties. Whereas a typical contract is drafted using natural language, the terms of smart contracts are expressed in code, similar to a programming language like javascript or HTML.  The contract is then ""executed"" by a computer – given the conditions of the agreement, and a set of defined inputs, the smart contract enforces its own terms.  Readers familiar with blockchain technology will know that the term ""smart contract"" is often used in a more general sense to refer to any script or program that operates on a blockchain. However for the purposes of this article, we focus on the narrower meaning described above: using code in place of traditional contractual agreements between parties.  Point of origin  The term ""smart contract"" was first popularized by computer scientist Nick Szabo in his 1997 paper ""The Idea of Smart Contracts"". The vending machine, he described, is the simplest form of a ""smart contract"" – a mechanical device designed to transfer ownership of a good (a candy bar) when provided with a certain defined input ($1.50). Because the machine itself ""controls"" the property – by being physically sealed – it is able to enforce the terms of the ""contract"".  Extending the concept, Szabo suggested that computer code could be used in place of mechanical devices to facilitate far more complex transactions of digital property. Rather than transfer ownership of a candy bar, a smart contract could transfer ownership of real estate, shares or intellectual property. The program would define what ""inputs"" were necessary for the contract to execute – things like payment, votes of board members or any other condition that can be expressed by code.  Consider a basic options contract. A call options contract entitles the holder to buy a given security at a defined price. In our example, Alice buys our ""smart options contract"" from Bob. The contract entitles Alice to purchase 100 shares of Acme Inc from Bob at a defined price of $50 per share. The contract has an expiry date, after which Alice is no longer entitled to buy the share at the defined ""strike price"".  Expressed in pseudo-code, a simple ""smart options contract"" might look like this:  contract Option {  strikePrice = $50  holder = Alice  seller = Bob  asset = 100 shares of Acme Inc.  expiryDate = June 1st, 2016  function exercise ( ) {  If Message Sender = holder, and  If Current Date < expiryDate, then  holder send($5,000) to seller, and  seller send(asset) to holder  }  In the first section, the smart options contract defines the relevant terms – the underlying asset, the strike price, the identities of each party and the expiry date. Then, a function we’ve named ""exercise"" enables the holder to trigger the purchase of shares at the strike price at any moment before the expiry date.  The function first checks to see if the entity triggering it (the ""Message Sender"") is the holder, and then checks to see that the contract is still within the expiry date.  If both are true, then the contract immediately executes by transferring cash from the holder to the seller, and the assets from the seller to the holder, according to the contract’s terms.  Two challenges  Until recently, smart contracts were little more than theory. In general, there were two fundamental challenges that needed to be addressed before smart contracts could be used in the real world.  First: How would a smart contract actually control real assets so that it could enforce an agreement? A vending machine, to return to Szabo's example, controls property by physically securing it inside of itself. But how could code do the same?  In our options contract above, the ""exercise"" function transfers money and assets between the two parties. How can a computer program control real-world assets like cash and shares?  Second: What computer would be trusted to ""execute"" those terms in a way that both parties could rely upon? Parties must not only agree on the code of their contract, but also the computer which interprets and executes that code. A shared standard, at the minimum, would have to exist, and be used in a way that was verifiable by each party – ideally, without requiring the parties to physically inspect the computer in question.  Enter blockchain  In the last few years, solutions to both of these problems have come into sight. Emerging research and development surrounding blockchain technology may provide a basis to make smart contracts a reality in the near future.  The first use of blockchain technology was the digital currency bitcoin, made famous by its mysterious creator and sudden price increase in late 2013. In the last few years, its underlying ""blockchain"" has been intensely studied and adapted to expand its use beyond simple digital currencies. Startups, open-source communities and large financial institutions alike are improving and expanding the technology with the aim of one day using it to facilitate exchange of fully digital assets.  A blockchain is an authoritative database. It is a database that, by virtue of the way it is maintained and updated, has very high trust properties. Blockchains are not controlled by a single party. There is no single company, organization or person that has ultimate control over a blockchain.  Rather, a blockchain is maintained, updated, and secured by a network of participating computers.  Each computer keeps a full copy of the blockchain database, and each copy is kept in synchronization with the others by a system of cryptographically-enforced rules called a consensus algorithm.  Crucially, blockchains are append-only databases, meaning that once information is validly added, it can never be removed. Each update to the blockchain is secured by a cryptographic process known as a hash function, which allows the network to detect and reject any attempt to distribute an edited copy of the database.  In this way, blockchains form the foundation for the recording and transfer of fully digital assets.  Because the blockchain is always kept in synchronization, there is only ever one true record of ownership – essential to prevent anyone trying to double-spend their assets by sending it to multiple parties at the same time, a problem that plagued previous attempts to create digital assets. Because it is impossible to edit a blockchain once it has been properly updated, parties have mathematically-enforced confidence that the record of their ownership will persist into the future.  Emerging solutions  While the technology is still in early stages, many now believe that if blockchains can create a secure platform for the trade of digital assets, they may also solve the two fundamental challenges facing smart contracts.  First, smart contracts require a way for computer code to control real assets. By enabling fully digitized assets, blockchains make it possible for code to exercise control over property. On a blockchain, control over an asset means controlling a cryptographic key that corresponds to the asset in question, rather than any physical object.  Thus in our example above, the options contract could itself have control of the underlying assets, rather than an escrow agent. When the ""exercise"" function is called, the operation of the code would transfer the assets without requiring any human assistance.  Second, smart contracts need a ""trusted computer"" that would execute the terms of the contract. This is the blockchain itself. The blockchains that are being developed today are not only databases, but distributed computers that can execute code as well as record ownership of assets.  Our “smart option” example would itself be uploaded and stored on a blockchain, and would be executed by the blockchain when instructed to do so.  The same properties that make blockchains ideal to record ownership of assets also make them ideal for executing smart contracts. Once the code of the contract is uploaded and recorded onto the blockchain, the parties can have confidence that the contract cannot be altered, and that it will perform as expected.  Impact upcoming  Blockchain smart contracts may not be as far away as we expect.  Banks, exchanges, and other financial institutions are actively developing blockchain technologies that will enable them to store and trade real assets over blockchain systems. Nasdaq, in partnership with blockchain startup Chain, has developed and begun testing a private-market equity trading platform.  A next-generation open-source blockchain called Ethereum aims to be the foundation for a new industry of non-traditional decentralized commerce. A consortium of 43 banks, working with blockchain firm R3, have begun work on a shared industry platform based on blockchain technology specifically designed to facilitate financial agreements.  Within a few years, financial markets may be trading fully-digital assets across blockchain networks, with the terms of those trades enforced by code.  The impact will not be limited to financial contracts, although these are the most obvious use cases. As techniques are developed that enable other types of property to be recorded and transacted on a blockchain, the possible applications for smart contracts will multiply.  If they ever become widely used, smart contracts could alter the nature of corporate and commercial transactions. The advantages of software that have revolutionized so many industries – automation, predictability and speed – could finally be brought to bear on segments of the legal industry.  Representing contractual terms in code, rather than natural language, could bring clarity and predictability to agreements. A smart contract could be tested against any set of inputs – in other words, against any set of material facts which it takes as inputs - allowing lawyers on either side of a deal to know precisely how the contract would execute in every computationally-possible outcome.  In our simple Smart Option example above, each of Alice and Bob could ""dry run"" the contract in a simulated environment, where every possible input is tested. While this is unnecessary in such a simple example, imagine a contract with thousands of inputs, and hundreds of nested if-then statements – as is common in many complex financial agreements.  These, too, could be tested against every possible input defined in the code. Analogous to how software developers “debug” their own code by testing it in every possible circumstance, lawyers could test contracts, giving each side of a deal a clearer understanding of their risk – and perhaps requiring fewer billable hours.  Disruption not replacement  Of course, smart contracts will never fully replace natural-language law.  Many types of agreements can never be fully expressed in code or executed by a computer – for instance, those that involve human performance rather than the exchange of dematerialized assets.  Even fully self-executing contracts will ultimately need to make reference to legal terms and concepts that will define each party’s rights if their relationship leads to litigation. Rather, the emergence of smart contracts will lead to a re-evaluation of common practice, as lawyers and clients alike discover which types of agreements and terms are best suited to code, which should be left to natural language, and how to combine each to achieve the best of both worlds.  For now, smart contracts are still science fiction.  But for the first time we have a technology that could be used to bring them into commercial use. While that day may still be years away, legal professionals would be wise to consider how these innovations could impact their business.  By the time smart contracts become viable, law firms should hope that they have lawyers to match.  For a deeper dive into smart contracts, read our latest CoinDesk Research report.
