42414458,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB6zR7,1676329631,How the SEC Could Reshape Ethereum’s Staking Landscape for the Better,"A surprise settlement last week between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Kraken, a leading crypto exchange platform, raised existential questions for the future of “staking” on blockchains like Ethereum.  Ethereum experts and blockchain analysts say the seemingly adverse industry development in the U.S. may bring benefits, such as helping to decentralize the Ethereum network and forcing service providers to clarify how they earn yield for retail investors.  The settlement, first reported by CoinDesk, forced Kraken to wind down its staking-as-a-service offering to U.S. clients. Previously, the service allowed retail investors to “stake” some amount of cryptocurrency with blockchains in exchange for yield.  So-called proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum enlist users to stake crypto assets as a form of security guarantee in exchange for rewards, similar to interest payments. Proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin, by contrast, are operated by a more energy-intensive process of crypto “mining.” (Ethereum famously transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake last year.)  Read more: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?  The Kraken-SEC settlement could spell doom for a growing class of staking-as-a-service products, which allow users to stake with lower up-front costs or technical know-how than typically required. Around $25 billion worth of ether (ETH) is currently staked on Ethereum, with 18% of that stake held by Coinbase and Kraken – the two largest platforms with staking services.  The Kraken settlement, classifying the exchange’s staking-as-a-service offering as a security, may have ramifications for the staking landscape at large. “Decentralized” staking services like Lido and Rocket Pool are scratching their heads as to whether the SEC’s viewpoint on staking might actually benefit them in the long term. The “solo-stakers” that help run Ethereum sans intermediary also see a silver lining in the SEC’s action, since it could potentially make the network more secure and decentralized, down the road.  Staking-as-a-service platforms  Ethereum staking requires a minimum of 32 ETH (~$50,000). Staking without an intermediary means setting up a computer to act as a “node” on the Ethereum network – a complicated task that can incur financial penalties if done improperly.  The barriers have left room for exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase to help retail investors stake – primarily as a way to earn interest. Both platforms eliminate the 32 ETH requirement by pooling user funds together, and they do all the heavy lifting of spinning up a node themselves.  But as SEC commissioner Hester Peirce noted in a fiery dissent to the agency’s crackdown on Kraken, “staking services are not uniform, so one-off enforcement actions and cookie-cutter analysis does not cut it.”  In legal filings, the SEC said it took particular issue with the mechanism by which Kraken calculated the yields it paid to users: “The defendants determine these returns, not the underlying blockchain protocols, and the returns are not necessarily dependent on actual returns that Kraken receives from staking,” the commission wrote.  Coinbase insists that its own service is different. “True on-chain staking services like ours are fundamentally different,” Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal argued on Twitter. According to Grewal, Coinbase differs from Kraken in that it directly ties user payouts to the rewards earned via staking.  Though Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says he would be willing to fight the SEC should they come after Coinbase’s staking offering like they did Kraken’s, what comes next is unclear.  As CoinDesk reported last week, analysts at Coinbase admitted in a report that the developments around Kraken will likely affect the “pace of staking growth going forward.”  Decentralized staking services  In the immediate aftermath of the SEC ruling, investors seemed to think it was good news for “decentralized” staking platforms. The LDO token behind Lido, the largest decentralized staking service, briefly jumped 10% following last week’s news around Kraken. Lido and similar protocols remove access barriers to staking similar to centralized services, but they run their operations entirely on smart contracts – the self-executing computer programs that live on blockchains.  “There's not a crypto exchange management team that's working on your behalf pooling your money,” Lex Sokolin, the chief cryptoeconomist at the Ethereum research and development firm ConsenSys, told CoinDesk.  It’s that key differentiator – the lack of a centralized company or management team – that decentralized offerings hope will earn them less scrutiny from regulators. “My hope is that you're going to get a very different substantive view on the Lidos of the world, but I do think it's very much an open question, and it's a legal one and a difficult one,” Sokolin said.  Lido currently accounts for 29% of the total share of staked ETH (competing services, like Rocket Pool, are significantly smaller). Should the centralized staking-as-a-service model disappear entirely, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Lido’s footprint grow even larger.  Solo-staking  Some members of the Ethereum community see a silver lining in the SEC’s enforcement action, telling CoinDesk that it could help shift control over the network (and other blockchains) to a larger set of people.  According to Jaydeep Korde, whose company Launchnodes builds infrastructure to help people with 32 ETH spin up a node themselves, staking services like Kraken’s undermined crypto’s goal of creating a “decentralized” financial system. “Having new intermediaries who, through a magic black box, give you an interest rate doesn't strike me as being that different to what we have right now,” Korde told CoinDesk.  According to Korde, the news about Kraken may finally push those with 32 ETH towards solo-staking, where they opt to run their own nodes rather than hand control to a third party.  “I think this is good for decentralization,” said Ben Edgington, a product manager at Ethereum research and development firm ConsenSys. On a proof-of-stake network like Ethereum, one’s stake equates to their power over the network; if one party accounts for enough of Ethereum’s stake (around 50-60%), they can theoretically slow it down or block certain kinds of transactions. “In terms of the protocol and the health of the protocol, having a large centralized entity controlling a lot of the stake is not ideal,” said Edgington.  In contrast to Ethereum’s old proof-of-work system, where a handful of big mining syndicates amassed a disproportionate amount of influence over the network, Ethereum’s new proof-of-stake model was supposed to make the network harder to centralize. “It's always been our aim that Ethereum is an army of tens of thousands of solo node operators, not three or four large data centers,” said Edgington.  The growth of staking-as-a-service platforms (among other factors) risked jeopardizing this goal, but the SEC’s settlement with Kraken could help make Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system harder to monopolize.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RPL,"Sam Kessler, Margaux Nijkerk",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/13/how-the-sec-could-reshape-ethereums-staking-landscape-for-the-better,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48a6c2a173003b3a2fecba45738642abea71ce96-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Investors appear to be spooked by a regulatory crackdown on the Paxos-issued Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin and so are reducing their holdings on the platform.  Blockchain data on Nansen shows users withdrew some $2.8 billion of digital assets in the last 24 hours, outweighing the $2 billion of deposits during the same period.  The withdrawals have followed the New York Department of Financial Services ordering Paxos on Monday to halt issuing the $16 billion BUSD stablecoin and a looming enforcement action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Issued under the Binance brand, BUSD is the third-largest stablecoin and accounts for 35% of all Binance trading volume.  Monday’s activity also marked the largest, daily net outflows from Binance since November, surpassing December outflows when the exchange’s lackluster report about its reserves alarmed investors, according to a data dashboard by crypto investment product firm 21Shares.  Read more: Paxos ‘Categorically Disagrees’ With SEC That BUSD Is a Security, Says It Will Litigate if Needed  Binance reserves tested, again  The regulator’s action severely wounds the exchange because with some $13.4 billion of BUSD on the platform, BUSD is the largest asset in Binance’s reserves after Tether’s USDT, Nansen data shows. This amount accounts for 22% of the $60 billion of assets on Binance.  Nansen said that $3 billion in BNB, the native token of the Binance-helmed BNB Chain, represents almost 5% of all assets on the exchange, although blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence says the amount is much higher. Arkham recorded $6.9 billion worth of BNB tokens on the platform.  Given the large chunk of Binance-related assets on the platform, the withdrawals tested Binance and its reserve assets, Walter Teng, vice president of digital asset research of market analysis firm Fundstrat, wrote to CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  “Assuming Binance doesn't hold customer deposits 1:1, they might face withdrawal pressure,” Teng said. “On-chain liquidity for BUSD has already dried up, making redemption of BUSD for U.S. dollars or an alternate stablecoin to then meet customer withdrawals as the only viable option.”  Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, chief executive of Binance, assured investors in a tweet that customer funds are safe.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/13/binance-withdrawals-surge-as-paxos-busd-drama-weighs-on-the-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b863e67c1788c40ab249ac2c048a1cc5ef6c7d3-2192x1028.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Funding rates represent payments made on exchanges that trade perpetual futures contracts. Because perpetual futures contracts never expire, funding rates ensure the spread between spot bitcoin and bitcoin futures remains in sync.  When a funding rate is positive, long positions pay short positions, reflecting bullish sentiment. The opposite is the case when funding rates are negative, as they are currently.  To be sure, bitcoin’s funding rate is only slightly negative, but its recent trend is more noteworthy than the extent of its drop into the red, indicating a change.  Bitcoin’s term structure remains in contango, a condition when the bitcoin futures price exceeds its spot price. For crypto assets, contango occurs when there is increased buying in futures markets, and is often a bullish signal.  Bearish sentiment in BTC funding rates coupled with bullishness in term structure aligns with the increasingly cautious tenor of crypto markets. Bitcoin’s trading range has also contracted over the most recent four trading days, with an average daily move of 0.67%. Trading activity is declining as well because BTC’s trading volume has fallen below its 20-day moving average for 11 consecutive days.  Recent regulatory concerns are affecting both valuation and activity as investors reassess risk factors that emerged in the prior week.  Those developments include crypto exchange Kraken’s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to shutter its staking operations in the U.S. and to pay a $30 million fine.

42410839,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1Xl,1676325237,Crypto's Banking Problem: Industry Needs Access but US Regulators Keep Digital Assets at Bay,"Crypto can’t become what many of its proponents want it to be without banks, but U.S. regulators are circling the wagons around the banking system they oversee. That barrier is only getting wider as the Federal Reserve and other agencies turn away crypto firms trying to link with the traditional financial system.  Several recent regulatory actions – including the Federal Reserve Board’s (FRB) January decision to reject crypto-focused Custodia Bank’s application for membership – indicate federal regulators are coordinating on policy that aims to ring-fence crypto from the broader U.S. banking system, experts say.  The FRB’s rejection of Custodia’s membership application came hours after the Biden administration put out a statement urging Congress to “step up its efforts” to regulate the crypto industry and, when crafting new legislation, avoid “greenlighting mainstream institutions … to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets,” which the statement warned would be a “grave mistake” that “deepens ties between cryptocurrencies and the broader financial system.”  Shortly after Custodia’s membership application was denied, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City dealt another blow to the crypto bank, denying its long-pending application for a master account.  Less than two weeks after Custodia’s double-whammy rejections and the White House’s warning against crypto contagion, fresh rumors about more crypto banking crackdowns have begun to circulate.  On Wednesday, Fortune reported the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency – the independent wing of the Treasury Department that oversees the national banking industry – was rumored to be primed to reject two crypto companies’ applications for a national trust bank charter.  Paxos and Protego both received conditional approval to convert into a nationally chartered trust bank in early 2021, but the final status of their applications has hung in the balance longer than the allowed 18-month deadline.  Both institutions told Fortune the rumors were untrue, and a source with knowledge at Paxos also confirmed with CoinDesk that Paxos had not been asked by the OCC to withdraw its application, nor had the application been denied. But over the weekend, Paxos announced it would stop offering the Binance USD stablecoin at the direction of the New York Department of Financial Services.  Crypto lobbyists and industry leaders spent years trying to sell the benefits and credibility of digital assets and blockchain technology to U.S. lawmakers and regulators. Then 2022 rolled around.  ""A lot of that is out the window, and it's very frustrating,"" said Georgia Quinn, general counsel for Anchorage Digital, who has been cringing over the U.S. regulators' latest maneuvers. ""I'm very disheartened by all of the recent statements and positions.""  Still, she said she hopes crypto-focused banking can find its place.  ""I want more regulated institutions, not less,"" she said. ""You don't address risks by pretending they don't exist.""  To achieve a future with widespread, mainstream usage of crypto's innovations, the industry needs to tie up to regulated U.S. banking. That's how people will come off the sidelines and adopt digital tokens, virtual properties and smart contracts as part of their daily financial lives, when their trusted financial institutions can interact directly with all the new products.  But 2022 was a poisoned pill that may knock digital assets down for a long time. A general response from U.S. regulators to step back from 2022’s mayhem of gigantic hacks, bad ideas, laundered money, manipulated prices and gross fraud is beginning to harden into policy.  Inertia is a powerful thing in Washington, D.C. Once momentum builds in one direction, it tends to continue. Stopping it and reversing it can take a massive exertion.  Mick Mulvaney, a former acting White House chief of staff under former President Donald Trump, has been watching how the federal government is stiffening its crypto resistance after the November failure of the FTX crypto exchange. But he thinks the federal position isn't calcifying just yet and that the most important response could eventually come from the lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where he used to be a congressman.  ""I don't think it's cast in stone,"" Mulvaney, who now advises Swiss crypto startup Astra Protocol, said in an interview. ""There's a vibrant debate on the Hill right now.""  Whether the administration's momentum will be checked by eventual legislation that makes allowances for crypto innovations, he said, ""My gut is that Congress will win.""  So far, however, regulators have had the first say.  Coordination  “Agencies have been pretty open about the fact that they are coordinating and working together on crypto and digital-assets issues,” said Grant Butler, a Boston-based partner at law firm K&L Gates.  “There’s a lot of caution and skepticism on the part of banking regulators around cryptocurrency and the exposure to that in the financial system,” Butler added.  Regulators, Butler said, want to avoid crypto-focused banks with different charters or different primary regulators, which makes it more difficult to consistently track them and spot potential issues.  “Banking regulators have long been skeptical of allowing nontraditional activities into the banking system because doing so introduces risk and that risk, ultimately, is borne by the public when things go south,” Chris Odinet, a professor of commercial law at the University of Iowa College of Law, told CoinDesk.  And that risk, as Joseph Lynyak, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at Dorsey & Whitney, pointed out, can be enormous.  “Considering that the crypto industry lost approximately $2 trillion in a few months last year, the federal agencies are correct in adopting a go-slow approach – or at least, it is understandable,” Lynyak said. “Can you imagine what would happen to the banking system if banks lost a similar amount of capital in as short a period of time?”  A shifting stance  The White House and regulators have come together on crypto in a way rarely seen outside of a financial crisis. President Joe Biden started it with an executive order issued last March. After that, the Treasury Department and banking agencies mostly headed in the same direction.  The high-profile collapse of FTX lent new energy, and some rethinking of the government stance. On Jan. 3, the Fed, OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) put out a joint statement cautioning banks about the risks of working with crypto companies. On Jan. 27, the Biden administration warned against the possibility of crypto contagion, and egged on the regulators.  That same day, the Fed announced a new policy that effectively insisted that any firms seeking access to the Fed system (think: Custodia) has to face the same crypto constraints as any other banks – including a formal sign-off from their federal regulator any time they want to engage in activity with digital assets. That policy went into effect on Feb. 7.  Banks that have been closely allied with the crypto sector have begun distancing themselves as their U.S. watchdogs made it clear they'd see crypto as a danger. Moonstone Bank, where Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading firm Alameda Research had an ownership stake, said it’s retreating from crypto and returning to its old community-bank identity. And Signature Bank said it’s limiting crypto-tied deposits, representing about a quarter of its business.  “I think the Biden administration was not super enthusiastic about private crypto before [FTX],” said Julie Hill, a professor of banking and commercial law at the University of Alabama School of Law. “But I think that the FTX collapse has made them even more concerned.”  Stablecoins  In addition to the concerns raised by FTX’s implosion in November, Hill suggested that part of the Federal Reserve’s decision to reject Custodia’s membership application could be tied to its plans to issue a stablecoin. Paxos, one of the companies rumored to be facing its own rejection by the OCC, also has its own stablecoin. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied, to that of another currency, commodity or financial instrument.  When the U.S. regulators first weighed in on stablecoins, they argued that future policy should insist issuers either be banks or be regulated like a bank. They've changed that tune and now suggest that issuing stablecoins could risk an institution's safety and soundness.  “It seems that [the FRB is] very concerned about the Custodia plan to issue a stablecoin. It seemed like that was part of the motivation behind their decision to not allow them to be a member,” Hill said. “I think that other crypto-first companies that hope to issue stablecoins should be nervous.”  Butler, however, doesn’t see much truth in theories that Custodia’s rejection was due to fears that its stablecoin would compete with a future central bank digital currency (CBDC).  “I don’t think that’s what this is,” Butler said. “I don’t think regulators are comfortable with [stablecoins] or with the banks that wish to issue them. There is a degree of discomfort there. But I don’t think [the rejection] is driven by competition with a central bank digital coin. I think there is a broader risk concern.”  Operation Choke Point 2.0?  Several figures in the crypto industry, including investor Nic Carter, have made compelling comparisons between the current crackdown on crypto banking and Operation Choke Point.  Choke Point was a secretive initiative at the Department of Justice (DOJ) during Barack Obama’s presidency. Federal officials improperly pressured banks to close the accounts of legal businesses such as gun and ammunition dealers and payday lenders.  Though regulators denied the program’s existence for years, documents and depositions made public in 2018 revealed the extent of the operation’s reach.  Butler said he could see why people would draw comparisons but he doesn’t think the current crypto banking crackdown is quite as bad as Choke Point.  “Obviously a couple people have gotten into trouble, but [regulators] aren’t saying, ‘Hey, you can’t bank these clients, they’re verboten,” Butler said. “They’re definitely trying to ring-fence it … but I think there’s a little bit of a difference, and a different sort of underpinning to the actions than there was in the Operation Choke Point situation.”  Wall Street wins  Banking experts told CoinDesk they don’t see regulators attempting to cut crypto out of the banking system entirely. Instead, they think regulators are trying to drive crypto towards established banking institutions that are already heavily regulated.  “Banks are going to be able to offer traditional custody services and safekeeping services. Granted, they’re going to have to meet a very, very high bar on the safety and soundness around that [but] using a bank to custody [crypto] doesn’t seem foreclosed,” Butler said.  However, Butler expects the ability to use a bank charter as an on-ramp from fiat to digital currencies will be curtailed until there’s more regulatory clarity.  “I think [the current crackdown] is probably going to impact the ability to get banking services but I think there are going to be people out there to service the industry,” Butler said. “As far as doing it through a bank or being a novel bank that does this – no, I think it’s going to be pushed out of the banking sector.”  What next?  While getting pushed out of the banking industry isn’t exactly a death knell for crypto, it could present a significant impediment to crypto moving into the mainstream.  “The regulators' stiff-arming is a problem for crypto because being tied to banks would add legitimacy to crypto in the minds of ordinary Americans,” said Ian Katz, a banking policy expert at Capital Alpha.  “Perhaps if the crypto world stabilizes, over time regulators will become more willing to let crypto into the heavily regulated banks,” Katz added. “But for now it looks like regulators want to put a wall between crypto and banks. And that will probably contribute to the feeling among many consumers that crypto is too risky or niche for them to get involved with.”  Correction (Feb 14, 2023 18:09 UTC): Corrects the spelling of Joseph Lynyak's name.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Cheyenne Ligon, Jesse Hamilton",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/13/cryptos-banking-problem-industry-needs-access-but-us-regulators-keep-digital-assets-at-bay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48ee9afef8bcdd7c1b3939b686482ba8954418a1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414474,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB70dP,1676322892,"Bitcoin, Ether Drop as Investors Fret Over Inflation Data, Stablecoin Regulation","Bitcoin kicked off a new week by sliding 1.4% to trade at around $21,640 as worried investors chewed over regulatory activity in the stablecoin sector and the next inflation report due Tuesday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has fallen about 9% this month to lose roughly a quarter of its gains from a January surge. Some analysts are now predicting BTC will find support at $20,000 in upcoming weeks.  Early Monday, the New York Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos to stop minting new Binance USD tokens (BUSD), saying the token wasn’t being administered in a “safe and sound” manner. The order resulted in BUSD – a fiat-backed stablecoin with a 1:1 value against the U.S. dollar – falling to 0.9950 cents against its rival tether (USDT) on the Binance exchange, crypto data firm Kaiko noted.  Bitcoin (BTC) began sinking at the start of February, although its most significant drops have come over the past week after crypto exchange giant Kraken agreed to shutter its staking service in the U.S. and to pay a $30 million fine in a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  BTC had as recently as Feb. 1 changed hands above $24,000. Investors will be eyeing Tuesday’s consumer price index (CPI) to see if the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy has continued to chip away at inflation and to predict the size of the central bank’s next interest rate hike. The CPI dipped to 6.5% in December to continue downward momentum that has pleased riskier asset markets. But Fed governors remain concerned about over-tightening money supply and casting the economy into a deep recession.  “The news flow has been rather bearish for crypto and you can’t forget about tomorrow’s inflation report that could be hot and spell trouble for risky assets,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Monday note.  “If inflation comes in scorching hot, bitcoin could breach the key $20,000 level and target the $18,500 region,” Moya added.  Ether (ETH) followed a similar pattern, declining 3.1% over the past 24 hours to recently trade at $1,490 – ETH’s lowest level in about a month. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was down 2.8% for the day.  Decentralized borrowing protocol Liquity was Monday’s biggest winner among over 160 assets in the CMI, with its native LQTY token surging 46% to trade at $1.01 from 69 cents from the previous day, same time.

De’ Medici said in a Twitter thread that he hopes the donation will emphasize the significance of digital art as pieces sit next to works of legendary artists such as Pablo Picasso, Georgia O’Keefe and Andy Warhol.  “With this gift, my goal was to help bridge the worlds of on-chain art and contemporary art, which until now have separately existed,” said de’ Medici in a press release. “I’m thrilled to have these historically significant on-chain works contextualized beside many iconic works of art in LACMA’s collection.”  Michael Govan, LACMA CEO and Wallis Annenberg foundation director, said he’s enthusiastic about how the donation will carry forward the museum’s emphasis on the intersection of art and technology.  “We’re grateful to Cozomo de’ Medici for his forward-thinking generosity that will expand the diversity of our art collection and propel us to develop new standards and techniques for preserving works created on the blockchain,” Govan said in a press release.

Staking withdrawals could catalyze either positive or negative short-term price changes for Ethereum. In the long term, staking withdrawals will make Ethereum an even more compelling investment. Thesis Despite its recent price decline, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) remains at the center of decentralized finance, smart contracts, NFTs, and other fast-growing trends that should support long-term price appreciation. The ability for investors to sell staked Ethereum could be an upcoming catalyst, and the success of the Zhejiang Testnet in facilitating test withdrawals indicates that this upgrade is right on the horizon. The Zhejiang Testnet Ethereum Github As shown in the GitHub page for the Shanghai Network Upgrade, all code changes necessary for this upgrade (which will enable staking withdrawals) have been merged into Ethereum's code base as of last month. Now, the only thing stopping this upgrade from going live is testing. I last covered Ethereum almost a year ago, and incidentally, my last article was also about testing consensus layer upgrades. For a more detailed explanation of testnets, shadow forks, and other Ethereum development/testing details, I recommend reading that article as well. In summary, a testnet is what Ethereum developers use to test changes to Ethereum's code before enabling those changes for the actual blockchain (the mainnet). Because even the best developers sometimes make mistakes and write buggy code, a testnet is a fairly standard tool that helps balance Ethereum's need for stability with its continued evolution. Developers have been creating testnets for parts of the Shanghai upgrades, including staking withdrawals since November of last year. Zhejiang is a testnet that ran more recently - on February 7th. It's notable because it included all of the code for the Shanghai upgrade and because it was the first testnet that successfully simulated staking withdrawals without reports of glitches or major issues. The lack of reported issues is a direct measure of the success of a testnet; if a testnet uncovers no issues, then in theory the tested code can also go live on the mainnet without any issues. In practice, a testnet isn't guaranteed to uncover all potential issues on the mainnet, which is why it's still premature to consider staking withdrawals fully de-risked. That said, Ethereum's developers already have a track record of successfully deploying consensus layer upgrades, and I'm confident that they'll pull this one off as well. The expectation is that Ethereum developers will run two more testnets after Zhejiang to reduce the risk of launching on the mainnet as much as possible. If these testnets are as successful as Zhejiang was, it seems likely that staking withdrawals are on track to go live for everyone on the mainnet sometime in March. Why Are Staking Withdrawals Good? ethereum.org It's objectively great news for Ethereum as a technology that the Shanghai upgrades are closer to going live. It should be obvious that the ability to withdraw staked Ethereum unlocks a beneficial new functionality for those who use the blockchain. Among other benefits, the increased liquidity of staked Ethereum should encourage more people holding Ethereum to stake it, thus improving the security of the proof-of-stake network. To give a personal example, I keep less than half of my Ethereum staked due to liquidity concerns. Although the Zhejiang testnet increases my confidence that withdrawals are coming soon, I don't want to stake the rest until I'm completely confident that I'll eventually be able to withdraw it. As soon as staking withdrawals are live, I'll stake 100% of my Ethereum. Also, once these upgrades are complete Ethereum developers will be able to shift their focus to implementing sharding, the final of three major upgrades planned for Ethereum in recent years. Among other benefits, sharding will improve the scalability of the network, especially as it relates to layer 2 protocols like Arbitrum (ARB-USD). I'll likely cover this in another article as that upgrade gets closer to launching. Will Staking Withdrawals Increase Ethereum's Price? It's clear from the previous section that the Beijing upgrade is good for Ethereum as a technology, but that doesn't mean that its release will push Ethereum's price higher. I'll be the first to admit that when I published a similar article last year about the ""The Merge"" (Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake), Ethereum's price tanked leading up to its successful Merge and has been basically flat since. And that's despite the fact The Merge included changes that should directly support Ethereum's price such as the switch from being inflationary to being deflationary. It's possible that the successful implementation of staking withdrawals will boost Ethereum's price as new investors decide to buy in right afterward, either because they were waiting to buy until the network successfully went through a risky hard fork to implement withdrawals, or because they're lured by a more liquid staking yield. However, it's also important to consider that there's currently a lot of staked Ethereum (aka ETH2) which has been illiquid for a long time. ETH2 began rolling out in December 2020, when Ethereum's price was around $600 - less than half of today's price. (Incidentally, this technical improvement correlated with a strong bull run in Ethereum and the price nearly reached $2000 less than two months later.) Some of the early adopters of ETH2 who began staking Ethereum at $600 (or perhaps even less if they'd been holding for years already) may be itching to sell after over two years of being unable to and earning a nice 100%+ gain. All told, the amount of staked Ethereum recently passed 16 million , double the 8 million I reported a year ago. 16 million staked coins represent 13% of Ethereum's circulating supply and about 4 days' worth of trading volume. If everyone rushes to sell these staked ETH as soon as it's possible, that amount of selling pressure could certainly tank the price. Fortunately, I think that this scenario is unlikely, considering that half the ETH2 was staked within the last year and that much of the ETH2 was actually staked at a price range similar to today's. Most people staking Ethereum are likely long-term holders, since they were hopefully well aware of the liquidity issues with staking when they signed up for it. Still, it's inevitable that some ETH2 will be sold when it becomes possible to do so. Thus, in the short term, it's difficult to determine whether the positive attributes of staking withdrawals, the increased selling pressure from more liquid staking, or other factors will prove most important to Ethereum's price movement. Is Ethereum A Good Long-Term Investment? Thinking longer term, even if there is a run for the door as soon as staked Ethereum can be sold, early stakers will eventually run out of ETH2 to sell. That leaves only the positive long-term benefits mentioned above. Once staked Ethereum is liquid, the investment thesis for Ethereum can actually be spun to sound a lot more like a stock or company than a ""worthless"" digital currency. If I had to pitch Ethereum with staking withdrawals as an investment, I'd say something like: Ethereum enabled trustless digital transactions and other blockchain-based products for a growing community of artists, collectors, and merchants. Investors can earn a yield of over 4%, and ""shares"" are regularly retired with the supply shrinking since last September. A ""stock"" in a fast-growing industry that offers a high yield and buybacks certainly sounds appealing to me. The abrupt post-Merge flattening and eventual decline of Ethereum's supply is a huge story that's apparently been lost given Ethereum's lackluster post-Merge performance: YCharts The one caveat here is that Ethereum's yield is not like a dividend, which can support a share price and reduce volatility. Rather, the yield received (when converted to USD) would fluctuate depending on Ethereum's price. That caveat will rightfully prevent risk-averse investors from finding Ethereum as appealing as a high dividend stock, but it shouldn't matter as much to long-term growth investors. Conclusion Staking withdrawals are coming to Ethereum soon, and that's great news for Ethereum as a technology and long-term investment. In the short term, there's some risk that the increased liquidity of ETH2 or other factors will cause Ethereum's price to decline despite this good news. So, I'm not looking at staking withdrawals as a reason to buy extra Ethereum now, and I am continuing my regular DCA instead. But if Ethereum did sell off harshly after successfully implementing staking withdrawals, I'd eagerly buy more than usual. And I'm sure that many other potential investors are thinking the same way.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577886-ethereum-zhejiang-testnet-means-staking-withdrawls-coming?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9364760.jpeg

The risk-off day also comes on the eve of the highly-anticipated CPI report for January. Looking at intraday price action, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) slid 1.6% to $21.62K as of 3:22 p.m. ET, and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) gapped down 3.1% to $1.48K, both bucking the stock market rally . The tokens were in the red so far in February following January's notable jump. Binance coin ( BNB-USD ), the native token of crypto exchange Binance, dropped nearly 10% at the time of writing after New York's financial watchdog ordered Paxos Trust Company to stop minting new dollar-pegged BUSD ( BUSD-USD ) tokens, citing the stablecoin issuer's failure to safely administer the token. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was said to have also been looking to sue Paxos on the basis that BUSD is an unregistered security. On a similar note, the SEC last week charged crypto exchange Kraken for not registering its staking platform. The slump in token prices had more influence of crypto-related stocks than the broader stock market, as the majority of crypto-related stocks were changing hands in negative terrain. Greenidge Generation ( GREE ) -5.3% , Silvergate Capital ( SI ) -2.5% , Core Scientific ( OTCPK:CORZQ ) -4.6% and Coinbase Global ( COIN ) -2.7% were among some of the biggest intraday losers. It's worth noting that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ), the largest publicly-traded bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fund, has seen its discount to net asset value swell to 46.6%, almost the widest discount on record, according to TraderBlock data . That comes roughly one week after crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group had reportedly started selling shares in a number of trusts operated by its subsidiary Grayscale Investments at a deep discount.

42414461,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB6zbj,1676319025,Hacking Crypto Wallets Is Latest Strategy in Quest to Recover Lost Billions,"One of the downfalls of crypto is the costliness of user errors. If someone loses the keys to their crypto wallet, they could lose access to their crypto holdings forever.  Luckily for them, there’s a growing cottage industry of wallet recovery services, a breed of crypto dark-arts practitioners to help recover lost funds.  Currently, the most popular method is known as “brute-forcing,” where the recovery specialists use a cryptographic technique that involves bombarding the wallet with as many passwords as possible, in hope of eventually guessing the right one.  But there’s a new trend in the crypto safecracking that’s more akin to finding a secret entryway.  Unciphered, a wallet recovery service founded in 2021 and based in San Francisco, targets poor implementation of wallets by looking at software and cryptography vulnerabilities.  The latest instance emerged Friday when it was revealed that Unciphered hacked the popular OneKey hardware wallet earlier this year by extracting a private key through exploiting a vulnerability in the firmware – the embedded programming that provides machine instructions. OneKey disclosed the vulnerability in a statement, acknowledged Unciphered’s role in detecting the vulnerability and said it had quickly fixed the issue.  “Software ages like milk,” said Chris Wysopal, a computer security expert and adviser to Unciphered. “At some point, I don't care how good the security system is. It could be months, it could be years, but someone's going to find a problem with it. Because it’s not perfect.”  The story offers a reminder that while crypto wallets are often seen as the more secure and do-it-yourself alternative to keeping digital assets on centralized exchanges, users are sometimes on their own when it comes to any problems with the wallets.  How many lost wallets are there?  Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, has reported that up to 23% of bitcoin (BTC) may be lost forever because of lost or forgotten keys – the password made up of a string of letters and numbers that allows you to access and manage crypto funds. That works out to about 3.79 million BTC, or almost $90 billion, a stunning figure that represents nearly a tenth of the overall market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies.  “Most of the losing happened in Bitcoin early on, in the early years of crypto,” Kimberly Grauer, the director of research at Chainalysis, told CoinDesk.  Early statistics on ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, are harder to come by. However, data provided to CoinDesk by Crypto Asset Recovery shows that 7% of presale wallets have never had any crypto move – suggesting the ETH in those wallets have just been sitting there, untouched, ever since the Ethereum blockchain went live in 2015. That’s 621 of the 8,893 wallet addresses, or 521,574.608 ETH (roughly $875 million today).  Read More: Meet the Technician Who Unlocks Your Forgotten Crypto Wallets  Bugs can lock your crypto, too  Some users may have lost funds through no fault of their own but because of flaws in the wallet’s underlying code. In such cases getting help from a recovery specialist can be like calling a private eye to look for clues.  “Some of our jobs are kind of reducible to forensics jobs or have a sizable digital forensics component,” Frank Davidson, the co-founder and chief information security officer of Unciphered, told CoinDesk.  One of the most prominent cases at Unciphered involved an older version of ethereumwallet.com, founded by Anthony Di Iorio, a co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain.  The Unciphered team was trying to recover the wallet of a customer who couldn’t log into his EthereumWallet even though he had the correct seed (recovery) phrase and private key.  Unciphered audited the code and discovered a vulnerability in the wallet that affected a far greater number of users.  “Helping this one customer helped us find this bigger problem,” Eric Michaud, Unciphered’s co-founder, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  In this particular version of the EthereumWallet, known as the legacy wallets, Michaud said his company was able to find over 15,000 ETH (about $25 million) that was exposed.  After this discovery, Michaud realized that Unciphered could recover funds for more customers who had their crypto locked up in their legacy EthereumWallets. If there are more people who can’t access those wallets, Unciphered wants to help those people to get their funds back.  “He opened this entire door,"" Michaud said about this initial client, who got the ball rolling for recovering other customers' funds that were locked in the legacy EthereumWallets. “There's countless people locked out that we haven't reached out to yet or we hope they come to us because they're clearly still locked out.”  When contacted by CoinDesk, Di Iorio said that EthereumWallet’s several versions were never considered to have exited the beta, or testing, phase. There is a warning on the website: “We recommend small amounts only, and remind you that use of this software is at your own risk.”  Di Iorio’s firm decided to shut down the wallet in 2018 and notified customers to move over to Jaxx, another user-friendly wallet that Di Iorio founded. Di Iorio later deprecated the EthereumWallet, meaning users were not able to access their funds if they did not transfer them within a specific timeframe. According to Di Iorio, multiple notifications and even grace periods were provided prior to the sunsetting.  Di Iorio said he doesn’t have contact information for former users to share with Unciphered.  “I don't see how I can help,” Di Iorio told CoinDesk.  The customer who opened the doors for Unciphered’s EthereumWallet recovery spoke with CoinDesk and confirmed the details of the case.  Five years after the customer lost their crypto to the bug vulnerability, Michaud said that “we actually sent him back his crypto on Christmas Eve,” a nice present.  Unciphered takes 10% to 35% of the recovered funds, depending on the risk of accidentally breaking the wallet, and the costs of performing the actual attack.

Instead, Kraken is “being punished, as opposed to given guidance,” Warden told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday.  Last week, the SEC reached a $30 million settlement with Kraken and the San Francisco-based exchange “immediately” closed down its staking-as-a-service platform to its U.S.-based customers.  Kraken began offering staking services in 2019. However, according to the regulator’s press release, its staking services were promoting the sale of an unregistered security.  Warden said that if Kraken’s protocol had been more of a “pass-through profit-taking from the underlying protocol,” the agency might have been fine with Kraken.  The SEC could argue that because Kraken is an exchange that happens to offer digital assets, it should still be regulated like other exchanges that fall under the agency’s jurisdiction, she added.  According to Warden, the broader issue is that regulation for crypto has yet to be defined.  The SEC also reportedly plans to sue stablecoin issuer Paxos, a fintech firm that offers crypto services, over its alleged sale of an unregistered security, stablecoin token Binance USD (BUSD).  “It’s not the regulation so much, it’s the way that regulation is taking place,” Warden said. She added that regulation by enforcement and the lack of regulatory clarity is making it difficult for crypto platforms to know what the agency wants from them.  That may, in turn, have a substantial impact on crypto and the use of stablecoins and staking, which Warden said are “important primitives” to the industry overall.  “They are trying to do the right thing,” Warden said of the industry, pointing to Kraken and Coinbase as examples. “And with some better regulatory clarity upfront, they would have, in my view, probably done exactly what the SEC needed them to do,” Warden said.

42410849,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs21W,1676316860,Binance USD's $16B Market Cap Up for Grabs as Paxos Regulatory Action Stirs Up Stablecoin Rivalry,"CORRECTION (Feb. 13, 2023, 20:35 UTC): Paxos will cease issuing Binance USD at the direction of the New York Department of Financial Services, not the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The decision by stablecoin issuer Paxos to stop issuing Binance USD (BUSD) at the direction of the New York Department of Financial Services will shake up the $136 billion stablecoin market – with industry leaders Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC likely to gain share.  Another winner could be MakerDAO’s DAI, the leading decentralized stablecoin.  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, had invested heavily to promote BUSD’s use on the platform. While Paxos, a New York-based fintech firm, was the official issuer of the stablecoin, Binance lent its brand to the token.  In September, Binance even took the drastic step of ditching trading pairs involving Circle’s USDC and requiring trades in BUSD. The move quickly helped grow BUSD to become the third-most popular stablecoin, with $16 billion outstanding, and it claimed 35% of Binance’s monumental trading volume.  Now, with the crackdown by New York state and reportedly one to come from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that effort is grinding to a halt, opening the way for rivals to reclaim ground. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao wrote Monday in a tweet that “BUSD market cap will only decrease over time.”  USDT is the largest stablecoin, with some $69 billion outstanding, followed by USDC at $41 billion, according to CoinGecko data. DAI’s market cap is $5 billion.  “Paxos' decision will profoundly alter the stablecoin space and upends a pillar of Binance's strategy for global crypto dominance,” Clara Medalie, digital asset analysis firm Kaiko’s director of research, told CoinDesk.  New York’s action against Paxos opens a fresh chapter in the fierce rivalry for dominance on the stablecoin market. Stablecoins have grown to a $135 billion class within crypto, are the backbone for the crypto ecosystem and sometimes hailed as the “crypto’s killer use case.”  By maintaining a fixed price, usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, the tokens are essential to facilitate trading digital assets on exchanges and transfer value between traditional fiat money and cryptocurrencies.  “This headwind will lead to a consolidation in the stablecoin market towards blue chips such as Tether and USDC,” Leena ElDeeb, research associate of digital asset firm 21.co, said in an email. “The winner will most likely be Tether, as we are seeing millions of dollars of inflows to USDT on Binance.”  Read more: Circle Sounded Alarm on Paxos, Told NYDFS Binance’s Stablecoin Wasn’t Fully Backed  Said Kaiko’s Medalie: “USDC also has much to gain with the absence of BUSD, and it will be interesting to see if Binance re-lists the stablecoin.”  However, some have raised concerns that Circle might be the next target of the SEC’s enforcement campaign on stablecoin issuers.  “If they take these circumstances to their advantage, we may witness the rise of decentralized stablecoins such as DAI in resistance against censorship,” ElDeeb said.  What’s next for Binance?  Given that Binance only gave its brand to BUSD, Paxos’ decision is expected to have limited impact on the exchange’s finances.  “It may not impact their business too much,'' Conor Ryder, research analyst at Kaiko, said of Binance. “The damage is likely mainly reputational for now, especially after phasing out USDC and other [stablecoins].”  Read more: Binance Says BUSD ‘Funds Are Safu’ but a Regulatory Cloud Is Forming Over the US  It’s possible the Paxos withdrawal may not be the end of Binance’s stablecoin aspirations.  “Binance may yet find another issuer for BUSD or find a different solution,” Megalie said. “There are still many variables at play, but for now we can expect traders to slowly start cashing out of their BUSD holdings.”  Traders ditching Binance USD  After the news of the regulatory action broke, Paxos and Binance assured investors that BUSD redemptions will be honored until at least February 2024.  “This did not stop traders from rushing to the exits,” digital asset research firm Kaiko wrote in its morning newsletter.  Investors have been scrambling to get rid of their BUSD holdings, putting pressure on the token’s intended $1 peg, based on trading and blockchain data.  On Binance, the BUSD-USDT trading pair’s spot trading volume surpassed $3 billion in the past 24 hours, recording the largest daily volume since the November market crash induced by the implosion of FTX.  In the largest BUSD pool on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve, where traders can swap between stablecoins, traders almost depleted the USDT, USDC and DAI liquidity. Now, 85% of the pool’s liquidity is BUSD, making it difficult for traders to exchange large amounts of BUSD, and forcing sellers to accept losses at the discounted exchange rates. At current rates, a trader exchanging 10,000 BUSD will receive 9,982 USDT.  Additionally, blockchain data on Nansen shows that the Paxos treasury on Monday had already transferred some $275 million of BUSD to a burn address, taking those tokens out of circulation.

GBTC’s discount to net asset value (NAV) reached its lowest level since Dec. 29 on Monday, according to data from TradeBlock. This comes as the Financial Times reported last week that Digital Currency Group (DCG) started selling holdings in several investment vehicles run by Grayscale at a steep discount, according to U.S. securities filings.  The discount has been widening since the report was published on Feb. 7, when the discount was at 43%.  The shares are currently trading at a 47% discount to NAV, the widest discount since late December 2022, when the discount hit a record 49%. The discount initially plummeted after news of Genesis’ and DCG’s exposure to disgraced crypto exchange FTX.  Grayscale and CoinDesk share the same parent company, Digital Currency Group.  “There has been a significant surge in the price of bitcoin recently, which, combined with increasing regulation, has forced Grayscale to somewhat decouple GBTC from the price of bitcoin, which may have undermined the value of GBTC,” said Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner at Storm Partners.  Bitcoin was up 40% in January, but has since retreated slightly, losing 9% for the month to date.  Ahmed noted that “Grayscale is fighting a battle on many fronts with some of the most influential minds in crypto,” but expects “the bitcoin trust to find calmer waters.”  “However,” he added, “nobody saw the disaster of FTX before it was too late. The fall of Grayscale could have a similar impact.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/13/grayscales-gbtc-discount-widens-to-near-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3b85fa5c237a671ca3b4a7b0bdd997033fd7f62-2709x2032.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price pattern is fulfilling expectations laid out in the previous update for a larger degree rally. Produced with Avi Gilburt and Ryan Wilday ""2022 has been a challenging year for crypto investors. The past several months have had all the hallmarks of a bear market given all of the incredibly negative developments throughout the crypto space, with several major bankruptcies in exchanges going down. Most recently, and perhaps the largest (to date) was the demise of FTX."" from Jason Appel's November Article, November Technical Update On Ethereum . Considering ETH (ETH-USD) lost 67.50% in 2022, ""challenging"" is perhaps a mild characterization for the second-largest cryptocurrency. But with a new year has come new sentiment and a marked change in price action. More specifically, in the first 35 days of 2023, ETH rallied as much as 43.5% from the 2022 close, and even with the recent week's pullback, price is up roughly 29% year-to-date as of writing this article. In the aforementioned November article , the black count (in the chart immediately below) was presented that entailed an intermediate wave (4) bottom in place from the June 2022 low and price in the early stages of an intermediate wave (5) to take price up to $6300+. In today's article, we will review the progress of that prospect and explore larger degree alternatives. Specifically, with regard to alternatives, we will take a look at the path presented in purple labels on the chart below from the November 2022 article. Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) From the November article: ""And while our larger more immediate bullish thesis in BTC has certainly reduced in confidence due to the prolonged break below $24k, ETH has more closely maintained adherence to larger degree expectations laid out this spring."" In terms of the broad strokes, this characterization of BTC has very much remained, and we ought not entirely ignore its ramifications for the overall crypto market. Within Elliott Wave analysis, we tend to view each chart on its own, and using this as a technical discipline allows us to ""tune out"" a lot of factors that have a spurious relationship to price prediction. As such, for predictions regarding the price of Ethereum, our best resource is to follow a price chart of Ethereum. And at the same time, based on the history of the crypto market in general, it has proven unwise to entirely ignore what's happening in Bitcoin as much of the market, including ETH, has yet to develop sufficient independence from Bitcoin. Overall, this leaves us still with a cautiously optimistic bias for Ethereum. So far, price has done nothing to deviate away from the black count from the November update. In that article, the following question and answer was posed: ""What's needed to more confidently establish the bullish thesis? Price needs an impulsive rally back above the late October high for starters. Five waves up, first exceeding $1,680, and then $2,030 (the August 2022 high) would be a very positive development towards bulls emphatically taking control."" Also, from the article: ""At the smaller degree, so long as price remains over $995-$1k, expectations are for upside follow through."" To date, the initial parts of this prescription have been met: Support held $1k and price has formed a potential impulse exceeding $1,680. A more detailed analysis of the smaller time frame from the November 2022 low will follow, but to be sure, price still needs another high to complete an initial impulsive 5 up from the November low for wave circle i of 3. Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) The ideal action for the bullish count will be to finish up this pullback early into the coming week and possibly as soon as tonight (2/12) sustaining above $1,400 and then rallying up to $1,790-$1,900 in the coming weeks. While a move above $1,900 would appear more bullish in the short run, a direct move over the August high would be more fitting of an A-B-C up from the June low, as opposed to a 1-2, i-ii. In more simple terms, reaching $2,030-$2,550 in more direct fashion would paradoxically favor a completing 3 wave corrective rally from the June 2022 lows. This would align more closely with the purple path. Thus, the desired path here for the bullish case is a move up over the early February high without exceeding $1,900. In either case, assuming the price holds $1,400 and rallies up past the early February high, $1,715, as stated in the title subheading, the subsequent pullback should tell the story of Ethereum in 2023. Support for the impulse up to new all-time highs will sit in the $1,300-$1,550 region. So long as $1,300 holds, the black count to new all-time highs can be maintained cautiously as the operative count, but a sustained move below $1,200 will shift the odds in favor of the larger purple count. The purple count, while still the alternative, is not to be ignored. The more direct path to new all-time highs in ETH presented in black (the black count) is hardly a slam dunk at this point. The purple count entails that the 2018 high was just an extended wave (3) of Primary 3 to 1.382; the subsequent pullback, Primary wave 4, held necessary fib support, bottoming above the .618 extension; then the move into November 2021, the all-time high struck between the larger 1.618-1.764 extensions, was typical of an extended 3rd. Larger degree fib support for this prospect, for a Primary 4th wave, would be $300-$375, where the larger degree 1.0 extension sits and the .382 retrace of the move from the Wave 2 low in December 2016 to the all-time high. See Weekly Chart below: Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) Smaller degree: Ethereum has a potentially impulsive structure from the November 2022 lows that reached the 1.618 extension in three waves and looks to be nearing completion of a wave (iv) pullback into standard Fibonacci support, $1,446-$1,527. So long as ETH makes no sustained break below $1,400, expectations are for a low to develop in this region and a rally up to $1,800+ to commence. (See chart below) Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) In summary, (see daily chart below for a broad comparison of black vs. purple) the expectations are more confidently suggesting a low to form in the very near term above $1,400 and commence a rally to $1,800+. Upon arrival at $1,800+, while the black count portending a path to new all-time highs is favored, risks of a strong drop-down to $300~ increase significantly, especially if this incoming rally more directly exceeds the August 2022 highs into the $2,030-$2,550 region. In order for black to remain favored, the price will need to maintain above $1,200 on the subsequent pullback. Below $1,200 and the purple count becomes operative and de-risking an excess exposure will become imperative. Jason Appel (Crypto Waves) As such, adding long exposure early in the week between $1,400-$1,527 offers favorable risk-to-reward for a trade targeting $1,800+ at which point reducing exposure and playing cautiously will be the name of the game at least until price drops into wave ii of 3 support.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577862-technical-update-on-ethereum-for-february-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9361251.jpeg

42388084,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR4kDh,1676313381,"Sanctioned Mixer Blender Re-Launched as Sinbad, Elliptic Says","Blockchain analytics company Elliptic said in a blog post on Monday that an anonymizing service for crypto transactions that was shut down last year has likely re-launched under a new name.  Wallets of Blender.io on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains were put on a U.S. sanctions list in May 2022 after it turned out North Korean hacker group Lazarus used the service to launder cybercrime proceeds. The U.S. Treasury Department said Lazarus was behind the infamous Ronin hack, when $625 million worth of crypto was stolen from a blockchain bridge protocol used by the popular non-fungible token NFT game Axie Infinity.  The hackers then used cross-chain bridges and mixers to launder the proceeds of the hack, and Blender.io was among them. The mixer ceased operations in April, but Elliptic said a similar service was launched in October, which received crypto from Blender.io-linked wallets and also was used by Lazarus.  Previously, Lazarus used Blender.io and Tornado Cash, another sanctioned mixer whose developer Andrey Pertsev is now under arrest in Netherlands. Unlike Blender.io, Tornado Cash is still working, despite its addresses being on the Office of Foreign Control (OFAC) sanctions list, Elliptic said. But Blender shut down and Sinbad seems to have taken its place, the blog reads.  Read also: Crypto Think Tank Coin Center Sues US Treasury Over Tornado Cash Sanctions  The North Korean hackers used Tornado Cash and Sinbad to launder the crypto they stole from Horizon, another blockchain bridge allowing users to trade assets between the Harmony blockchain and other chains. $100 million worth of crypto was stolen from Horizon in June, and part of it went to Sinbad, Elliptic said.  There are signs the same people might be behind Sinbad and Blender.io, Elliptic said. For example, before Sinbad was launched officially, its wallet received bitcoin from a wallet “believed to be controlled by the operator of Blender.” The founders might have been testing the new service, Elliptic suggested.  After Sinbad was launched, most of the incoming transactions would come from a wallet linked to Blender.io, and Sinbad operators rewarded promoters of the new mixer also from a wallet related to Blender. The two mixers had similar patterns of work, Elliptic said, and both have Russian-speaking websites and tech support teams, meaning both might have roots in Russia or Russian-speaking countries.",NEGATIVE,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/13/sanctioned-mixer-blender-re-launched-as-sinbad-elliptic-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d76a5059e4ea2c0598cd0183ff55682257e1f6d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Aavegotchi is an “open-source, community-owned NFT gaming protocol,” as stated on its homepage, where users can interact with the Aavegotchi metaverse and stake their non-fungible tokens with Aave’s interest-generating aTokens. Aavegotchis, the on-chain collectible NFT ghosts, have three attributes – collateral stake, traits and wearables – that dictate their value and rarity.  The now-passed proposal is entirely focused on wearables, a foundational asset of the Aavegotchi protocol which give each NFT ghost a fashionable outfit and a better chance at performing better in-game.  The Forge is meant to introduce greater diversity and utility to the wearables market by tokenizing the different economic values of wearables, allowing the AavegotchiDAO to “granularly control inflation and introduce deflationary mechanics while still creating new content,” according to the upgrade’s white paper.  With the Forge, players can create wearables by smelting unwanted wearables and recombining them with new materials, adding further composability to protocol assets.  The motivation behind the proposal stems from the consistent reduction in secondary market value and sales volumes of wearables.  Speaking in a discussion thread, Dr. Wagmi, the author of the snapshot proposal, said, “The wearables market is in a very difficult position with decreased demand during the bear market … Moreover, the Aavegotchi ecosystem is suffering from low engagement, difficult to understand path towards ‘leveling up’ and thus, little time spent in the Gotchiverse.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING,Sage D.

Miners rush to cash in their chips as contagion still weighs. Regulation and other risks still weigh. Big banks are coming with a digital payments option. I have been bearish on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) since my article in October of 2021 when I saw the risk of regulation coming amongst other threats. Investors have cheered the January rally in Bitcoin but it is technical in nature and nothing has changed fundamentally in the world's largest cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin rally was a tax-loss harvesting short squeeze Bitcoin's rally in January surprised the market with a surge from around $16,000 to touch $24,000. However, further gains could be hard to come by as nothing has fundamentally changed for BTC. Bitcoin started November around the $21,470 level and now trades at $22,586 with the recent stalling hinting at a return to $21-21,500. The November dump was created by the FTX collapse, while we saw a further dip from December. Many cryptocurrency investors, especially institutions, will have taken advantage of tax loss harvesting. Tax-loss harvesting is an investment strategy that can be used by investors to limit future tax liabilities by using losses in a current investing year. In stock markets, tax-loss harvesting comes with the risk of IRS scrutiny as an asset, sold and re-purchased within 30 days, can be classed as a ""wash trade"". Although there is no formal regulation on crypto, selling ahead of December would've been astute to do ahead of pending regulation. The heavy buying of Bitcoin in early January also created a huge short squeeze, so the rally in Bitcoin is purely technical. If we needed a bell to ring then a Barron's article predicting a ""GameStop moment"" in Coinbase ( COIN ) could be it. I advised my subscribers to buy Coinbase back on January 11 for a potential rally of 100% and it made a quick 70%, but I advised that it was a short-term trade, rather than an investment. Miners rush to sell BTC as the industry consolidates The Bitcoin mining industry suffered in 2022 as debt-laden miners struggled with the bear market in Bitcoin prices. The industry has now turned to consolidation as a means to survive with the merger of Hut 8 ( HUT ) and US Bitcoin announced this week. The move comes after bankruptcies in the mining industry. While some miners were able to pick up new mining rigs and facilities at distressed prices, others like Austin's Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy. Greenidge Generation Holdings ( GREE ) has now announced a debt restructuring with its creditors in late January and Pennsylvania's Stronghold Digital ( SDIG ) did the same this week. Another aspect of these activities is that companies have used the recent rally to cash in some of their bitcoins to pay operating expenses. Nevada-based, Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) said last week in its production update that it would sell 1,500 BTC to fund operating costs. “Marathon may continue to sell a portion of its Bitcoin holdings in future periods to support monthly operations, manage its treasury, or for general corporate purposes,” the company said. If the Bitcoin price continues to stall then further miner selling could cap any price gains. Another feature of that is that the rally has helped other beaten-down crypto investment firms that have struggled in the downturn. Forbes magazine estimated in August that 51% of Bitcoin trades are bogus, which raises further questions about liquidity. Regulation and other risks still weigh on the Bitcoin outlook The rally in Bitcoin has been technical in nature and nothing supports any real changes in the coin's outlook. Institutions were afraid to buy into cryptocurrency and that has only worsened with the FTX fallout and the lack of regulation and transparency. There are many risks for the crypto market which include Binance. I wrote an article on Binance which highlights its risk to the overall market as it is the largest trading exchange with a 24-hour trading volume of $15-20 billion against the $1.5-2 billion of its nearest rival, Coinbase. Binance was not very transparent about its reserves and is constantly under scrutiny with a recent money laundering probe and the links to the seized exchange Bitzlato. The real big risk is in regulation as the market police step up their efforts with a stronger mandate following the collapse of the FTX empire. Bitcoin's recent price drop is being attributed to news that another crypto exchange is coming under SEC scrutiny. The regulator was investigating San Francisco-based exchange Kraken for violating securities laws, according to reports. It was later reported that Kraken was paying $30 million in a settlement and agreeing to end its crypto staking operation in the U.S. Rumors are swirling that Coinbase will also be forced to end its staking, which could add to the recent job cuts at these companies. The SEC charged the Gemini and Genesis exchanges with securities violations in January and it could be the start of an enforcement wave, after the SEC's Chair, Gary Gensler, said previously that ""most"" cryptos were securities. Investors must look at one important aspect of the SEC's work. They went after Ripple to slow the progress of payments, they went after Binance and now Kraken to slow the growth of exchanges, and they even investigated the creator of the Bored Apes NFT collection. Those moves, combined with the charges against Gemini when the exchange was close to bankruptcy are a clear sign that the SEC is applying force and will continue to do so. Global regulation is a mechanism that looks set to clip the wings of the decentralized newcomers and serve the current financial system players. The International Monetary Fund is prevalent in wanting to regulate the industry and they set out their ideas after the FTX issues, which I have summarized as follows: ""We believe that crypto asset service providers delivering critical functions should be licensed, registered, and authorized"". That will require audits of the exchanges and enhanced scrutiny. ""The recent FTX failure showed how the combination of exchange, wallets, and market-making services under one group creates significant risks to the customers. It is particularly important that customer assets are segregated from other functions."" ""Stablecoins issuers should be subject to strict prudential requirements. We need strong, bank-type regulation for stablecoins, and central banks should take the lead in such an endeavor given stablecoins’ potential presence in the monetary system"". Yet more audits. ""There should be clear requirements on regulated financial institutions, concerning their exposure to, and engagement with, crypto"". ""Eventually, we need robust, globally consistent, comprehensive regulatory responses to achieve effective crypto regulation and supervision. The cross-sector and cross-border nature of crypto assets limits the effectiveness of uncoordinated national approaches"". In short, bye, bye to a decentralized financial system. Cryptocurrency will simply be a digital version of the current system, overseen by the same institutions. Finally, in the case of contagion, the market may not be over the worst as another BTC downturn would increase the heat on the mining industry and struggling firms like Silvergate Capital, ( SI ) which could be the next company to go bankrupt, and even threaten its troubled conglomerate, Digital Currency Group. Big banks step into the digital money arena with Although some investors doubt the ability of Central Bank Currencies (CBDCs) to get off the ground, all major countries are studying the option, with the UK pushing it harder recently. The Bank of England and the UK Treasury aim to introduce a digital pound by 2025. Another threat has emerged to decentralized money in the form of a digital payments project that will target the dominance of ApplePay and PayPal. JP Morgan ( JPM ), Bank of America ( BAC ), and Wells Fargo ( WFC ) are among the firms launching a digital payments wallet via their joint venture with Early Warning Services, LLC, which manages their Zelle Payments Network. The big banks are looking to target the popularity of their digital rivals with PayPal ( PYPL ) having more than 400 million active wallets in 2022, while Apple Pay had over 500 million active users. It is clear that we are moving to a digital age of money. However, it is still looking unlikely that the global payments system will be decentralized. Conclusion Bitcoin investors have cheered a sharp rally in January that was largely spurred by tax-loss shuffling and a big short squeeze. As the dust settles on that retail move, the cryptocurrency world is no closer to mass adoption or institutional buying. The arrival of digital payment options from the big Wall Street banks and the fallout from the decentralized finance and FTX exchange collapse could mean it is even further away. Bitcoin is currently a trading vehicle that tracks Fed rate hikes and inflation, while it reacts to negative sentiment from regulation etc. Investors should treat it as such and not get carried away in the hype.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577852-bitcoin-and-tax-loss-harvesting-rally?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/9359755.jpeg

42411218,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMD3t,1676308307,"Policymakers Need to Focus on Tokenization, Not Just Tokens","The focus of many in Washington, D.C., this year will be on crypto tokens – for example, FTT the token associated with failed exchange FTX. Without question there’s a role for oversight of the token economy to prevent abuses and to spotlight innovations. As this appropriate oversight takes place, Washington – and particularly the U.S. Congress – should focus just as much energy on tokenization, which has the potential to be a paradigm change for the economy, everyday Americans and people throughout the world.  John Rizzo is a senior vice president of public affairs for Clyde Group, a public relations and marketing firm based in Washington, D.C.  Tokenization of real-world assets – the process of representing tangible assets cryptographically – is already occurring but is a topic too rarely discussed in Washington. Yet, it is the blockchain-enabled innovation that, generations from now, may have the most significant impact on the economy and on the lives of middle-class Americans and those at the margins of society. To understand why Washington, and especially Democrats, should be eager to seize this opportunity, it’s important to understand the recent history of Democratic power in D.C.  I began serving as a staff member in Congress at the beginning of the Obama era during the Great Recession, and later was an appointee of President Joe Biden to the Treasury Department as the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic crisis ravaged the nation. A lot has changed in the U.S. between 2009 and 2022, but one constant was the role that Democrats in Congress and the White House played in wrestling to the ground crises that occurred during Republican administrations.  Within Democratic ranks, there was always a sense of palpable frustration and gallows humor, that our political capital, as former President George W. Bush once called it, was spent putting out fires we did not create. By the time the work was done, Democrats – in our view – had saved the American economy from a conflagration but failed to enact the kind of structural change in the economy that would fundamentally alter the circumstances of everyday Americans.  Read more: John Rizzo - How Industry Can Prevent the Crypto Winter From Becoming an Ice Age  The driving motivation of Democratic politics from the 1980s through today has been the creation of an economy that can allow a person from a working-class family to improve their circumstance through hard work and appropriate government aid. It’s a tall order to make such a vision a policy reality – particularly when the economy is enduring a crisis. It’s possible that by the end of President Biden’s time in office, the Inflation Reduction Act may be seen as such a catalyst. But the opportunity before the country to tokenize the trillions of illiquid assets may just be the silver bullet that Democratic politicians had searched for over generations; and it could also appeal to conservatives, who wish to achieve economic mobility through free market principles as well.  Today, public officials in Washington have an opportunity to come together and focus on powering a revolution in alternative assets that unlocks the storied American Dream for millions.  Generational wealth is often created through illiquid assets, such as real estate. There’s no question that accessibility to the stock market through savings vehicles, such as 401(k)s, has had a substantial, positive impact on the economic livelihoods of Americans who primarily earn their living through a paycheck. It’s also true that long-term wealth creation can be augmented through investments in illiquid, alternative assets. So what if market participants and policymakers support the tokenization of those illiquid assets and create pathways for the average American to invest in a piece of them? All of a sudden the gains that a person can achieve in a lifetime of working are multiplied.  Additionally, tokenization on a blockchain will create a level of transparency and risk mitigation for individual investors that would not exist otherwise. For example, think of a worker holding an on-chain token for an attractive illiquid asset. It only costs them a small amount of their own money due to large-scale tokenization, and gives them a piece of a valuable asset that they otherwise would need significant resources to buy into.  Read more: Jesse Hamilton – Are the Remaining Crypto Giants Staring Down the Barrel of the US Government’s Gun?  There are certainly risk considerations to alternative asset-investing and tokenization that must be considered by policymakers. Alternative assets, even those that are tokenized, contain additional downside risks for retail investors. Market participants will face skepticism from Washington lawmakers and regulators who believe alternative asset investing is merely a means for firms to increase profit while exposing consumers to greater risk of losses. Post-financial crisis, lawmakers and regulators have deep-seated concerns about firms socializing losses and privatizing gain.  If lawmakers, especially my fellow Democrats, spend the next year focused on tokenization as much as individual tokens, then years from now we may create a more equitable economic future. The American Dream will be more than a story we tell ourselves, but a tangible opportunity for all.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,John Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/13/after-ftx-crypto-tokenization-can-rebuild-the-american-dream-coindesk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a13ba0abf2dceb98f584d94fe0e3bf358f27256b-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393922,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc4et,1676298287,Coins of War: How Crypto Keeps Feeding Russia's War Despite Sanctions,"“Sanctions are good. They prove we’re doing everything right.”  When I ask Alexander Lyubimov if he’s afraid to get on the international sanctions list, he says:  “I’m totally striving for personal sanctions. I believe sanctions would be a sign of recognition for my work. I would even like the Hague Tribunal to learn about my existence and do something, say, put me on a wanted list for war crimes.”  Lyubimov is a director of the Novorossia Aid Coordinating Center (NACC), which is fundraising for Russian troops in Ukraine. Out of two dozen Russian pro-war fundraisers contacted by CoinDesk, he was the only one who agreed to speak with us by phone.  NACC is one of many formal and informal organizations in Russia that together raised at least $1.8 million in crypto to supply the struggling Russian army in Ukraine with ammunition, armor, surveillance drones, optical devices, vehicles and warm clothing.  The number looks modest compared to millions on crypto raised by Ukrainians, and the calls for donations have been much more low-profile, but some of the private Russian efforts managed to raise hundreds of thousands dollars for particular military units.  The sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made crypto even more popular as a fundraising tool for pro-Russian groups and influencers: Now, it’s the only working donations channel for Russian army sympathizers from abroad.  According to CoinDesk’s analysis, a significant part of the $1.8 million went to centralized exchanges, including Russian exchanges Garantex and Bitzlato, both suspected of processing large amounts of criminal funds. But popular global platforms such as Binance, Huobi and others received a fair amount of such funds, too.  In the meantime, on the other side of the frontlines, dozens of Ukrainian volunteers are out there looking for such wallets, reporting them and trying to get the money frozen. Sometimes, they prevail.  ‘Read the darknet’  NACC’s Lyubimov isn’t joking about wanting the International Criminal Court (in The Hague) to investigate his work as part of its Russian war crimes inquiries.  He actually does not believe he participated in any war crimes, but uses the term with defiance. “Our enemies call it ‘war crimes.’ I believe we’re defending our homeland,” he says.  NACC has been operating since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and fueled an armed insurgency in southeastern Ukraine.  The group has been raising funds to support the self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, the breakaway regions of Ukraine that pledged allegiance to Russia, and the local militia forces fighting the Ukrainian army. One NACC leader, Alexey Markov, even joined the command ranks of the militia. He died in a car accident in 2020.  The NACC has been using crypto for donations for a long time, along with traditional fiat rails, Lyubimov said. However, the war and sanctions on Russia made crypto even more relevant. Before the war, the NACC transacted only in bitcoin. After the war started, some supporters asked for more cryptocurrency options, and the group added ether (ETH) and tether (USDT) wallets. The donations increased, too.  “We had PayPal once but it had been blocked multiple times and now it doesn’t work as a tool for foreign donations anymore,” Lyubimov said. “A lot of people living far away want to support our work, and the only available way for them now is crypto.” He said Russian army sympathizers are donating crypto from Europe, Australia, the U.S. and other countries.  Lyubimov says the group long ago figured out ways to avoid getting its crypto blocked by exchanges. When asked how it does it, he responds obscurely: “Read the darknet. Everything has been invented long before us. People run shadow businesses and explain in detail how to do things right and smart.”  I ask him whether he means buying verified exchange accounts with other people’s names – a flourishing market CoinDesk investigated last year. Lyubimov refuses to confirm or deny it.  Read more: For $200, You Can Trade Crypto With a Fake ID  Since the beginning of the war, NACC has raised more than 1.3 BTC, 2.75 ETH and 5,700 USDT on the wallets it published on its website, or about $40,500 in total. In September, blockchain analytics company TRM Labs found about $21,000 on NACC’s wallets, which shows the fundraising drive only accelerated during the fall and winter.  Together with researchers from the Ukrainian crypto startup HAPI, which are monitoring such money flows, CoinDesk located many other wallets raising funds for the Russian troops. Then, with the help of blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain, we took a close look at how crypto is flowing from donors around the world to the Russian troops in Ukraine.  Russia needs more money  Wars are expensive, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict is no different.  As for the underequipped Russian troops, a constant money flow is needed to buy everything from surveillance drones to warm clothing – at least that’s what pro-war influencers tell their Russian followers as they solicit for donations.  Part of those donations comes in crypto.  “The ammunition guys needed, it was just absent, we were buying warm underwear, socks, winter boots,” said Anastasia Mikhaylovskaya, a Russian right-wing celebrity raising funds for the troops, in an interview in December. Russian troops appeared to be “totally unprepared” for the winter war as “nobody expected the [military] operation would drag on for so long,” she added.  Mikhaylovskaya wears many hats: a movie actress, a prominent public figure on Russia’s far-right, an ally of the conservative ideologist Alexander Dugin and Ukraine’s breakaway republics’ leadership. She has been actively raising funds for food, clothing, medicine, bulletproof vests and helmets, optical equipment and drones. In her December interview she claimed her team had raised over 400 million rubles ($5.6 million) to that point.  The wallets Mikhailovskaya put on her website for donations received over 6.36 ETH and 25,000 USDT since Feb. 24 (the beginning of the 2022 invasion), or about $34,000. More came to wallets published in anonymous Telegram channels raising funds in Mikhailovskaya’s name, like this one.  Several pro-Russian fundraisers who spoke to CoinDesk, including NACC’s Lyubimov, said crypto provides a smaller part of all donations and not many donors use this channel.  Inside the war coffers  Among Russian war fundraisers, the NACC and Mikhaylovskaya’s team appeared among the most efficient crypto fundraisers, according to CoinDesk’s analysis: Their wallets received significant amounts of crypto. However, some other groups raised even more.  For example, Rusich, the infamous right-wing paramilitary group linked to the Wagner private military company, which has been sanctioned by the U.S., raised over 2.7 BTC, 30 ETH and $88,000 in various stablecoins, a total of over $212,700, since the start of the war. The money raised helped Rusich buy optical devices, radios, various ammunition and medical supplies, according to the reports in its Telegram group.  Donations are not the only source of money for Rusich: In November, Russian news outlet Meduza found that at least once the group hacked a Ukrainian charity fund’s website and replaced one of the Ethereum blockchain addresses with its own. That wallet received 24.6 ETH, the most crypto of any of Rusich's other known wallets. Rusich leader Alexey Milchakov confirmed to Meduza that cybercrime is one of the group’s sources of funds.  Another influencer driving large flows of donations is Vladimir Romanov, a Crimea-based blogger who gained prominence after the war began. Last spring, Romanov started posting videos of visibly scared and exhausted Ukrainians apologizing for speaking badly about the Russian army on social media. The videos could have been filmed in Russian army tents, Novaya Gazeta Europe wrote.  In his channel, Romanov gives updates on the Russian troops’ advancement, often posing in military fatigues alongside active artillery. He’s raised funds to buy drones, cars and other equipment for various regimens of the Russian army, including unidentified units of rocket artillery and Special Rapid Response (SOBR).  Romanov’s wallets received over 4.3 BTC, or about $177,000, according to Crystal Blockchain.  Sisters Yekaterina and Valentina Kornienko from the Donetsk region use a totally different image: two blond women with soft smiles, accompanied by a little girl, presumably a daughter of one of the sisters, driving truckloads of drones, helmet, optical devices and other war supplies to the troops.  According to Kornienko’s Telegram channel, by September 2022 crypto wallets alone brought them 15 million Russian rubles, or about $210,000 of donations. The wallets Kornienko published on Telegram received over 2.7 BTC, 5.1 ETH and over $106,000 in stablecoins since the beginning of the war.  Other prominent fundraisers include sanctioned Russian state TV reporter Yevgeny Poddubny, who raised more than $215,000 in crypto; the Organization for the Promotion of the Preservation of Domestic Traditions and Cultural Heritage (MOO Veche), which raised about $82,000; and Interregional Organization Development of a Social Justice Society which has raised $86,700 since the war began, according to CoinDesk and Crystal Blockchain’s calculations.  Wallet hunters  While war-supporting Russians are chipping in to supply the army, Ukrainians opened a “hunting season” on such crypto accounts. HAPI, a Ukrainian startup building decentralized anti-money laundering (AML) tools, announced a two-week campaign to search for scam- and crime-related addresses last summer. People who found the most wallets got some of the project’s own HAPI token as a prize.  This first hunting season received good feedback from the Ukrainian crypto community, says Mark Letsyuk, head of analytics and research at HAPI. People asked the next one be focused on Russian war financing, he added. So in October the community hunted for war-related crypto wallets.  This is not just a fun exercise. HAPI works closely with Ukraine’s cyber police. Following their reports, dozens of exchange accounts have been blocked from helping to fuel Russian military aggression, Letsyuk said. Now, HAPI wants to allow volunteers to submit crime-related addresses and get rewards automatically if their submissions are verified as valid.  CoinDesk analyzed HAPI’s database and selected only addresses posted by accounts explicitly saying they’re helping the Russian army and paramilitary groups. Together with the blockchain intelligence firm Crystal Blockchain, we analyzed 302 such wallets.  Almost half of them never received funds, and it’s hard to check whether those that did spent the money on goods for the Russian troops. But the exercise has shown that despite the sanctions on Russia, crypto donations are still flowing to the Russian troops, often through known crypto exchanges.  The 160 wallets that received funds together got over $1.8 million worth of crypto, Crystal Blockchain calculated for CoinDesk, or over 35.2 BTC, 147 ETH and $588,000 in various stablecoins.  A significant part of all the crypto raised by those wallets has been sent to known centralized exchanges and crypto services. This should not come as a surprise. According to Chainalysis, centralized exchanges are still the main recipients of such illicit funds, with just four exchange deposit addresses receiving over $1 billion in criminal funds during 2022.  Crypto exchanges deal with it  In some cases, after the law enforcement weighs in, centralized exchanges freeze war-directed crypto. But often the legal process is just too slow to catch up with the speed of blockchain transactions, and there are ways to trick the exchanges’ know your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) controls.  For example, the anonymous author of the popular Fighterbomber Telegram channel, who raised over $21,800 to buy supplies for Russian fighter pilots, told CoinDesk his exchange account has never been blocked.  A representative for Rusich, when reached via an anonymous contact account on Telegram, told CoinDesk the group had its money frozen on exchanges in August, even before it was officially put on the U.S. sanctions list, but it “found other ways.” Then he stopped responding to CoinDesk.  In some cases, fundraisers received crypto directly to their deposit addresses on popular exchanges. Many of those addresses are on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by volume. Out of the 302 addresses CoinDesk looked into, 15 turned out to be Binance deposit addresses. These include two addresses belonging to the Russian gun-maker Vladislav Lobaev, which Binance allegedly blocked previously at the request from Ukrainian law enforcement.  A Binance spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that the remaining 13 addresses (out of the 15) also belong to the exchange and Binance “blocked all transactions where our investigations team was able to link to illicit use and any others are under ongoing investigations with local law enforcement.”  “When the war in Ukraine broke out, we quickly assembled a dedicated global compliance task force which included our leading sanctions experts. We took proactive steps against sanctioned individuals and entities. And, our investigations team has been tracking the illegal funding of military groups which is an ongoing effort and evolving investigation,” Binance spokesperson added.  CoinDesk also found deposit wallets at Huobi, Kucoin, HitBTC and other centralized services that have been used to raise funds for the war. The exchanges did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment by press time.  Interestingly, some of the funds ended up on Ukrainian exchanges WhiteBit and Kuna. Kuna founder Michael Chobanyan told CoinDesk the exchange froze several accounts related to funding the Russian military, and Ukrainian authorities have opened criminal investigations into the owners.  WhiteBit CEO Volodymyr Nosov told CoinDesk the exchange froze over $250,000 worth of crypto related to war sponsoring and that it works with the Ukrainian law enforcement closely. However, blocking money flows is a tricky task for exchanges because often crypto moves faster than blockchain analytics and law enforcement can investigate.  In such cases, “money goes in and out, and instead of the funds to freeze, we only have a paper trail,” Nosov said.  Another issue is the black market of exchange accounts, he added: “Say the money arrived from a Croatian user who went through the KYC/AML checks and has no clue. And the addresses themselves are not on sanctions lists.”  Remember Alexander Lyubimov hinting about darknet sources? Those tricks work.  It’s also hard to stop the money coming through over-the-counter (OTC) brokers’ accounts nested at exchanges, Nosov said. “[Imagine if] an OTC did their KYC/AML. Not under sanctions. How and for what reasons can you hold their money for a long time?”  Low-key fundraising  The $1.8 million raised by the wallets is a conservative number because we did not include the fundraisers declaring goals to help civilians on the occupied Ukrainian territories, as well as pro-Russian channels raising funds to support their own operations – although such campaigns might also contribute to Russia’s military efforts.  For example, Rybar, a Telegram channel publishing updates on the war, hasn’t explicitly raised funds for the troops. However, it’s actively looking for volunteers to track airplanes, deanonymize social media accounts and convince foreign citizens not to join Ukrainian army, which might help the Russian army in this war, too.  Another example is the hacker group KillNet. It has been raising crypto for itself, however, at least once boasted it helped one of Russia’s special forces units to buy binoculars, blockchain intel firm TRM Labs said in a blog post.  Madeleine Kennedy, director of communications at Chainalysis, told CoinDesk that the wallets the firm has been monitoring received $5.4 million, including both accounts raising money for the troops and propaganda channels soliciting donations to keep their own operations going.  Binance’s own investigation showed an even greater number: $7.2 million, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk. This indicates a notable progress in the war-sponsoring efforts: in October, Chainlaysis’ estimate was $4 million, and Binance found $4.2 million of such donations, Wired reported back then.  The amount raised also might seem very modest compared to the over a hundred million in crypto raised by major Ukrainian funds, both state-sponsored and private initiatives over the course of the war. It should not come as a surprise: while Ukraine has been openly calling for help – a government Twitter account asking for bitcoin and ether donations – Russia acts in a more clandestine way.  Ukraine’s message to the world has been very straightforward since the beginning of the war: “Help us defend against the aggression.” Russian leaders, by contrast, have been struggling to find a convincing narrative and didn’t even officially say the nation was at war until very recently. Russia is even less willing to officially recognize the lack of equipment and supplies for its troops.  Russian online fundraising goes in a volunteer, guerilla-style mode, with information shared in social networks but never by official army or government sources. This is true both for campaigns to help out Russian regular troops and arm the private paramilitary groups like Rusich.  The U.S. and other Western countries have been trying to stop those crypto flows, but it’s not that easy with crypto. While the U.S. Treasury Department is using a targeted approach and going after selected entities and crypto wallets, the European Union acted in a broad-brush style last fall, banning Russian citizens from using crypto services. Affected by those sanctions were also Russian journalists and activists who did not support the war and had to leave the country because of their position.  WhiteBit’s Nosov believes the existing KYC/AML systems in place don’t really work for crypto because they use approaches of the traditional fiat system, and are not catching up with the new reality of 24/7 crypto markets.  “The banking system is using tools that don’t work for crypto,” he said.

Having achieved its previously stated goal of 5.5 EH/s, the miner is considering options for the sale of surplus miners (above 5.5 EH/s of self-mining capacity) to re-invest in growth initiatives and/or corporate purposes. The company is scheduled to publish its fiscal Q2 results on Feb. 15. IREN edged higher by 1.1% in premarket trading.

It was reported on Sunday that the SEC intended to sue Paxos for selling BUSD as an unregistered security. This came only days after CoinDesk reported that Paxos was under investigation by NYDFS. BUSD is a Binance-branded stablecoin issued and managed by Paxos. Binance said it would be reviewing projects in markets where regulatory uncertainty could cause difficulties for users.  A modest weekend rally in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) was snuffed out by the Paxos/SEC report on Sunday evening. Bitcoin had managed to claw back above $22,000, but the price fell several hundred dollars in the minutes after the report hit, and early Monday morning was trading around $21,700, roughly where it closed the week last Friday. Wall Street equity futures steadied Monday ahead of the release of U.S. consumer price data on Tuesday.  EU banks would have to place the maximum possible risk weight on crypto assets under a draft law published by the European Parliament on Friday. The planned rules could determine how the traditional financial sector engages with digital assets. Under the proposed rules, as previously reported by CoinDesk, banks would have to disclose their direct and indirect exposure to crypto, while the European Commission prepares more detailed guidelines for the sector.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the yield on the U.S. two-year treasury note has jumped more than 30 basis points to 4.54% this month, reaching the highest since Nov. 30.  A continued move higher might push risk assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies, lower.  When yields rise, stocks tend to fall in value because of lower future earnings. Cryptocurrencies tend to move in line with stocks.

42388098,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR4lVD,1676289945,France to Tighten Crypto Registration Rules Next January,"Registration conditions for French crypto firms will be tightened as of January 2024 under plans published Friday by a committee of lawmakers from both chambers of parliament, but not as much as initially sought by the Senate, the country's upper house.  Newly applying companies will have to meet extra rules on internal controls, cybersecurity and conflicts of interest, the text from the Joint Committee said. That's less onerous than a previous Senate position that would have required companies to seek a license.  The text agreed on by the special legislative committee is due to be approved by the Senate on Feb. 16 and the National Assembly on Feb. 28.  Under French crypto regulations, companies can register with the Financial Markets Authority to show compliance with basic money-laundering and governance norms. No operator has yet received a license, a more burdensome procedure that also requires checks on financial resources and business conduct.  Faustine Fleuret, president of crypto lobby group ADAN, told CoinDesk the enhanced registration procedure was a “much more pragmatic approach” than the Senate's. But, she warned, a new requirement to have resilient and secure IT systems could prove difficult for small companies to meet and for regulators to police.  Senator Hervé Maurey last year proposed tightening the rules in the wake of the FTX collapse, and to ensure French law doesn't offer a loophole from complying with new European Union rules known as the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation.  Maurey’s plans would have meant any unregistered crypto provider has to seek a license as of October, which industry lobbyists said could prove unworkable.

Early Monday, BUSD, designed to maintain a 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar, slipped into a discount of 0.9950 against its rival tether (USDT) on Binance, according to data provided by Kaiko. Tether is the world's largest dollar-pegged stablecoin by market value.  The depegging to the lowest level in over a year happened after the New York Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos Trust Co, which issues and lists BUSD, to stop minting more of its tokens.  Paxos announced that it would cease the issuance of new BUSD tokens from Feb. 21 and end its relationship with Binance while assuring BUSD holders that every coin is backed by 1:1 with US dollar-denominated reserve. Further, the company will continue to manage redemptions of the product, according to a Binance statement.  The decline in BUSD/USDT pair on Binance suggests some traders are moving money into tether.  ""Essentially, by halting issuance of BUSD, there is no way for the stablecoin to grow. BUSD trading pairs will still be supported by Binance, but traders will gradually start to migrate to other stablecoins, which could be causing the discount on BUSD,"" Kaiko's research director, Clara Medalie, told CoinDesk.

42410836,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1R9,1676288670,Binance Says BUSD ‘Funds Are Safu’ but a Regulatory Cloud Is Forming Over the US,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s attack on crypto has continued for a second week. Just as Asia got to work on Monday, the Wall Street Journal had a bombshell: the SEC was going after Binance-branded stablecoin BUSD.  Going after BUSD might seem like a strange tactic to some observers. While the stablecoin wears Binance’s branding, it's issued by Paxos and regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. As opposed to Tether, which fought in court to keep what’s backing USDT a secret, BUSD is the right way to do a stablecoin.  Even as Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao tweeted that BUSD ""funds are Safu,"" the market reacted negatively to the report. Starting Asian morning hours on Monday, the BNB Chain's native BNB tokens fell 7% and BUSD saw some $52 million in inflows to exchanges - a sign of bearish sentiment, data firms like CryptoQuant said.  Sources close to the matter say the whole thing came without warning. But that’s not good enough for the SEC.  The regulator has placed a curse on it – the Howey Test – a 1933 U.S. Supreme Court case that determined that If a transaction is found to be an investment contract, it’s considered a security.  To be sure, there is an argument – an ancient one in crypto years – that stablecoins are securities.  A June 2022 briefing paper prepared by the Congressional Research Service outlines how under the Reves test, which came from a 1990 case that examined when a note is a security, stablecoins may qualify as securities under Reves’ four-part test.  “Even so, some commentators have proposed theories to support the proposition that stablecoin purchasers may be motivated by profits for purposes of the Howey and Reves tests,” the CRS paper reads. “In brief, the arguments appeal to the role that stablecoins play in facilitating cryptocurrency speculation and the fact that some stablecoins have traded above par during crypto-market turmoil.”  CRS concludes that the issue remains “unsettled,” but cautions that the lack of clarity sets the stage for a trial.  And here we are today.  The problem is, while the U.S. engages in “regulation by enforcement,” Asia’s financial centers are developing clear-cut frameworks.  Hong Kong is developing its own stablecoin regime, which looks to give the green-light to asset-backed stablecoins (provided the reserve assets are of “high quality and high liquidity” while meeting outstanding stablecoins in circulation) but gives a red light to algorithmic stablecoins.  Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is in the process of consultation with stablecoin issuers. One proposed route could see them being licensed under the city-state’s digital payment token service providers regime, which is regulated by the Payment Services Act 2019.  In an interview with CoinDesk during the Singapore Fintech Week, Ripple’s general counsel, Stu Alderoty, who’s currently leading Ripple’s fight against the SEC, said that all of this simply hurts the retail consumer in the U.S. that the SEC is supposed to protect.  “It has not provided clarity, and it's pushing innovation offshore to other economic centers like Singapore,” he said. “If the U.S. gets this wrong, they're going to lose their position as a leader in this new financial economy.”  Binance, in a statement to CoinDesk after the story broke, seemed to amplify Alderoty’s thoughts.  “Given the ongoing regulatory uncertainty in certain markets, we will be reviewing other projects in those jurisdictions to ensure our users are insulated from further undue harm,"" a spokesperson said.",NEGATIVE,BNB,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/13/binance-says-busd-funds-are-safu-but-a-regulatory-cloud-is-forming-over-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e7fa746929fef1d2af3540ead3c71a80888622d-2880x1620.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stablecoin issuer Paxos will stop minting new Binance USD (BUSD) tokens at the direction of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), with the news coming just after a report of the threat of legal action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  It was reported on Sunday that the SEC intended to sue Paxos for selling BUSD as an unregistered security. This came only days after CoinDesk reported that Paxos was under investigation by NYDFS.  BUSD is a Binance-branded stablecoin issued and managed by Paxos. Following the news of the SEC's legal action, Binance issued a statement that it would be reviewing projects in uncertain markets where regulatory uncertainty could cause detriments to its users.  NYDFS said that it had instructed Paxos to cease minting BUSD due to several unresolved issues related to Paxos’ oversight of its relationship with Binance. Paxos said it is ending its relationship with Binance for BUSD.

The nearly 7% fall marked the biggest drop for a major cryptocurrency as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) fell slightly below 3%.  BNB-tracked futures saw a relatively low $2.5 million in liquidations, Coinglass data shows, implying the move was mostly led by spot-driven sales.  Elsewhere, some $52 million worth of BUSD were sent to exchanges in a 24-hour period, data from CryptoQuant shows. As per CryptoQuant, the increase in inflow of any token to exchanges is mostly a bearish sign as it may precede traders selling their tokens.  “Instead of storing them in cold storage, moving into exchange wallets indicate the urge to turn coins into fiat or stablecoins,” CryptoQuant said in its data guide.  However, these inflows may also signal the use of stablecoins for the purpose of collateral for futures trades or to rebalance their portfolios generally, CryptoQuant added.  Meanwhile, CryptoQuant head of marketing Hochan Chung told CoinDesk in a Telegram message the inflows were likely stemming ""due to the fear that BUSD redemption might be questionable from the past experiences with [crypto exchange] FTX and [CoinDesk sister company] Genesis.""  ""However, both Binance and Paxos guarantee that the redemption will be managed without the issue,"" Chung added, pointing out that the negative net flows decreased after Binance founder Changpeng Zhao alleviated concerns about reserve backing in a Monday tweet.  As per a WSJ report on Sunday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Sunday alleges that BUSD is an unregistered security. The news came days after CoinDesk previously reported Paxos is under investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services, though the scope of NYDFS' investigation is unclear.  Paxos issues the Pax dollar (USDP) and Binance USD (BUSD) tokens, the latter is a Binance-branded stablecoin. Binance, on its part, told CoinDesk on Monday: “BUSD is a stablecoin wholly owned and managed by Paxos. As a result, BUSD market cap will only decrease over time.”  “Paxos also assured the funds are safe, and fully covered by reserves in their banks,” the Binance spokesperson said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/13/bnb-token-slides-under-300-binance-usd-inflows-signal-bearish-signs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/539c21595da5e6a03dc4e171ac73c812eaa499b0-4287x2700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchain data shows exploiter wallet 0x629 supplied over $46 million in various tokens to Maker, a lending and borrowing platform, early on Monday in Asia and used the collateral to buy $16 million worth of ether.  The exploiter bought 9,750 ether at $1,537 apiece and 1,000 staked ether (stETH) before wrapping these tokens for upward of 9,700 wrapped staked ether (wstETH), blockchain security firm Peckshield said Monday.  The purchases temporarily created buying pressure on ether, with prices increasing to over $1,530 from $1,520.  Staked ether is a derivative token issued to entities that lock up ether to help maintain and validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Wrapped tokens are representative tokens with the same value as their underlying asset that can be used on other blockchains.  Monday’s shenanigans continue the exploiter’s activities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  In January, the same wallet swapped 95,360 ETH, worth roughly $157 million at the time, on DeFi aggregator OpenOcean and then transacted smaller amounts of capital through several decentralized finance protocols such as Kyber Network and 1Inch.

42388099,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR4lLr,1676284072,Correlation Between Crypto Market and Nasdaq Turns Positive Ahead of US CPI Release,"The correlation between the crypto market and the tech-heavy Nasdaq equity index has turned positive, indicating the digital asset investors' renewed focus on risk appetite on Wall Street.  The 90-day correlation coefficient between the crypto market's total capitalization with Nasdaq has risen from -0.12 to 0.74 in four weeks, reaching the highest since early November, according to data sourced from charting platform TradingView.  In other words, the crypto market is again moving in tandem with technology stocks. On days when technology stocks trade higher, cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), are likely to do the same. Conversely, a decline in technology stocks could drag the crypto market lower.  Speculation that Federal Reserve would resort to rate cuts later this year is perhaps behind the renewed correlation between the liquidity-addicted risk assets. The long-held positive relationship had crumbled in November, thanks to the spectacular collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange that saw crypto investors dump their tokens despite the risk reset on Wall Street.  Correlation is determined by comparing the returns or general movements of two assets or products over a specific period. A correlation close to 1 suggests the two assets are moving in lockstep, in the same direction. Meanwhile, a negative correlation means the two assets move in opposite directions.  The renewed positive correlation implies increased sensitivity of cryptocurrencies to macroeconomic data releases like the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), which injects volatility into stock markets. The CPI days were among the most volatile for U.S. stocks last year, according to MarketWatch.  Tuesday's U.S. CPI report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is likely to show the annualized inflation declined to 6.2% in January from December's 6.5%, according to Reuters estimates sourced from FXStreet. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to drop to 5.5% from 5.7%.  A better-than-expected figure could dash hopes for the so-called Fed pivot in favor of easing, pushing technology stocks and cryptocurrencies lower.  ""Tuesday's CPI release is going to be a big number. Should CPI come in higher than expected, given the massive [non-farm payroll] surprise recently seen, this could prove quite bearish for risk assets,"" crypto services provider Amberdata's Gregoire Magadini wrote in the weekly newsletter published Sunday.  Per Andreas Steno Larsen, founder and CEO of Steno Research, the CPI data is likely to come in softer than expected. That would bolster the Fed rate cut hopes.  ""Based on our models and indicators – leading as well as lagging – we project the print to come in in the neighbourhood of 6.1% and 5.3% for headline and core, respectively,"" Larsen said in a note sent to subscribers last week.  ""Wages have decelerated in all meaningful forward-looking gauges, while housing is printing at extremes relative to reality in the CPI, meaning that we see a larger downside risk/reward in core relative to headline,"" Larsen noted, while forecasting positive contributions from energy component, prices for goods, including used cars, and fatigue in good prices.  The total crypto market capitalization recently rose to a six-month high of $1.06 trillion and stood at $948 billion at press time, representing a 25% year-to-date gain.

42388090,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR4kfl,1676281924,Bernstein Says Regulatory Backlash Will Lead to More DeFi and Offshore Crypto,"The cryptocurrency market fell in the last week as the Securities and Exchange Commission charged crypto exchange Kraken for offering its ""staking as a service"" program as an unregistered security, prompting concerns of multipronged regulatory action, Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  The allegations against Kraken are related to the exchange’s specific program, the report said. The main question is whether staking itself is a security, or was it specific to the way in which Kraken offered and marketed the program, the report added.  “The question remains whether the regulator would go after all staking programs, even if they provide specific disclosures around yield, allow users to actively stake and un-stake their crypto and operate on a pass-through basis, both on returns and costs,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  Bernstein says a decision by the regulator to prohibit all staking programs may not be straightforward, and some firms could decide to fight against the regulatory stance. The broker notes that the crypto industry still argues that the “absence of crypto-specific guidance or regulation will continue hurting even the good players, who choose to offer transparent staking services, which by itself would not classify as a security, under the Howey Test.”  The Howey Test relates to the U.S Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an investment contract. If a transaction is considered to be an investment contract, it's classified as a security.  There have been mounting concerns that more severe regulatory action aimed at “choking the fiat on-ramps to crypto” are in the pipeline after the Federal Reserve denied Custodia Bank’s application to join the Federal Reserve System, and following the SEC’s decision to issue a Wells notice to Paxos on its issuance of stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD), the report said.  Bernstein asks if this foreshadows action against other major stablecoins such as USD coin (USDC) and tether (USDT) or whether it is specific to BUSD. The regulator sees Binance International as outside of its control and therefore prefers to “rein in BUSD, via Paxos,” Bernstein said.  Such regulatory overreach will result in “further movement towards decentralized finance apps, built on-chain, by anonymous teams,” the note said. Regulators will find it even more challenging to follow this “regulation by enforcement” approach against thousands of DeFi founders without providing a transparent framework.  Growth will continue in more crypto friendly jurisdictions such as Singapore and Dubai, and new potential centers such as Hong Kong and London, the note added.

The planned rules could determine how the traditional financial sector engages with digital assets. Under the deal, as previously reported by CoinDesk, banks would have to disclose their direct and indirect exposure to crypto, while the European Commission prepares more fine-grained rules for the sector.  “The potentially increasing involvement of [financial] institutions in crypto assets-related activities should be thoroughly reflected in the Union prudential framework, in order to adequately mitigate the risks of these instruments for the institutions’ financial stability,” said an explanatory text by the parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. “This is even more urgent in light of the recent adverse developments in the crypto-assets markets.”  The proposed risk weight of 1,250% offers little incentive for banks to hold crypto, as – unlike other assets such as mortgages – banks would have to hold capital to match the amount of crypto they have.  The draft law asks the European Commission to propose further legislation by June to implement international capital standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The committee has proposed imposing a hard cap on banks’ holdings of unbacked crypto such as bitcoin (BTC), a suggestion which does not appear to be included in the EU’s legal draft.

This added to the $120 million in total fees accrued since September 2021, GMX’s dashboard data shows – which may signal fundamental strength for GMX’s native tokens.  The fees are shared across GMX’s two tokens, gmx and glp. Gmx is the utility and governance token and accrues 30% of the platform's generated fees, while glp is the liquidity provider token that accrues 70% of the platform's generated fees.  Ethereum fees clocked in at $4.7 million over that period. These fees were generated from user actions on Ethereum, such as transactions or issuance of ERC-20 tokens.  However, these fees do not include the fees generated by applications on Ethereum itself. Uniswap, for instance, had upward of $1 million in fees collected from users.  DeFi products like GMX rely on smart contracts to offer users financial services, such as trading and lending. GMX allows users to trade futures, or financial derivatives of spot tokens, on its exchange with leverage of up to 50 times the initial collateral.  GMX features such as low slippage, cheap fees and protection against unwanted liquidations have also contributed to the DEX’s popularity. It locked over $500 million worth of tokens as of Monday, with $455 million on Arbitrum and the remaining on Avalanche.  As such, some Crypto Twitter community members said a portion of Friday’s $5 million revenue came as Mechanism Capital founder Andrew Kang closed his multimillion-dollar positions on bitcoin and ether on GMX.

The platform is set to start operating in the first quarter of this year, CoinDesk reported earlier.  “Expect to see a wide range of borrower profiles: from traditional trading firms to various types of crypto-native players,” Jakob Kronbichler, Clearpool’s co-founder and chief operating officer, said in a statement. “Prime is also attractive to fintechs that provide lending solutions in the TradFi (traditional finance) world, such as loans in emerging markets.”  On Monday, the protocol also opened the onboarding and whitelisting process for institutional borrowers and lenders, who must endure know-your-customer (KYC) checks to be fully compliant, according to the protocol’s press release.  Clearpool’s move to build on Polygon is significant because borrowing and lending activity on competitor protocols like Maple and TrueFi mostly happened on Ethereum’s network.  Polygon is a sidechain for Ethereum that offers cheaper, faster transactions by batching transfers on its proprietary proof-of-stake blockchain while relying on Ethereum’s network for security. It has secured notable partnerships recently with Instagram and Starbucks.  Clearpool Prime’s launch highlights a growing trend of decentralized lending protocols catering to institutional capital with TradFi-compatible products after last year’s crypto implosion wiped out most of its businesses. Clearpool’s loan book has plummeted below $10 million from $108 million since November, data by DefiLlama shows.  Colin Butler, Polygon’s global head of institutional capital, predicted that 2023 will be a pivotal year for institutional decentralized finance on this week’s CoinDesk’s Money Reimagined podcast.

Prices:  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,031 −8.7 ▼ 0.8% Bitcoin (BTC) $21,740 −118.9 ▼ 0.5% Ethereum (ETH) $1,512 −25.7 ▼ 1.7% S&P 500  4,090.46 +9.0 ▲ 0.2% Gold  $1,872 +9.4 ▲ 0.5% Nikkei 225  27,670.98 +86.6 ▲ 0.3% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin Is Seeking Support  Happy Monday.  As Asia started the work week, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) fell to $21,750 and ether is down 1.8% to $1,514.  Joe DiPasquale of BitBull Capital says that bitcoin is now making an “underside test” having already lost the $23K and $22K levels that will determine if it will reclaim the $23K mark or fall to $20K “rather quickly.”  “The market is also reliant on macroeconomic developments, and given how December consumer prices were found to be higher than previously expected, the market may start to consider a bigger rate hike in the next FOMC,” he told CoinDesk in a note.  In looking for support, bitcoin is also digesting regulatory developments. Last week, Kraken – but not Coinbase – was fined $30 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its staking program in the U.S. The Wall Street Journal also reports that Paxos is next on the SEC’s hit list as it targets the Binance USD stablecoin.  “Regulations are also a concern for the crypto space, especially after the $30 million fine the SEC imposed on Kraken exchange,” DiPasquale said. “That being said, we believe it is better to get regulatory clarity in a slow market, as opposed to stricter developments during a full-fledged bull market.”  Despite all this, DiPasquale said his firm remains bullish on bitcoin – even if it blows through support levels.  “[We] would be looking to accumulate more if prices drop sub-$20,000.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Solana SOL +2.7% Smart Contract Platform Shiba Inu SHIB +0.4% Currency  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Loopring LRC −5.3% Smart Contract Platform Decentraland MANA −5.0% Entertainment Gala GALA −4.3% Entertainment  Insights  Ether Liquid Staking Platforms Will Benefit as SEC Actions Likely Fail to Knock Out DeFi  Crypto exchange Kraken and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have settled over staking.  The regulated Kraken exchange has to pay a $30 million penalty and immediately cease its U.S. service. But, more importantly, staking continues in the United States. Staking refers to locking tokens for a set period to help support the operation of a blockchain. Liquid staking, on the other hand, issues a derivative token that represents the amount of locked tokens to user, allowing them to access decentralized finance (DeFi) services such as lending and borrowing.  The way Kraken offered staking was unique, which is why the exchange’s service was shuttered and the SEC didn’t go after Coinbase or make a move on decentralized liquid staking protocols.  Central to the SEC’s statement is a lack of transparency on Kraken’s part. Yes, on-chain data shows that Kraken is one of the largest validators, operating a big staking pool. But the SEC seems to be concerned about fund flow: Is ether deposited into Kraken intended for staking really going to staking? Or is it being lent out?  Liquid staking protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool wouldn’t have that same problem. One could track their ether from their wallet into the pool via a block explorer or other chain monitoring tools.  In the initial hours after the market learned about the SEC’s interest in going after staking, via a Brian Armstrong tweet, liquid staking tokens such as Lido’s LDO surged and surged again when Kraken’s U.S. staking shop closed its doors.  A more reasonable explanation of the surge could come down to the SEC’s current ""Yellow Light"" towards staking. Staking as an investment strategy is not allowed, but staking as a technical service is.  As crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro tweeted: “Validation-as-a-service is not like an ‘earn’ program, not like taking capital into a business or fund. It’s a ministerial tech service.”  One thing that’s rather telling is that the total value locked of liquid staking protocols like Lido or Rocket Pool didn’t rise in the aftermath.  Since the start of the year, the total value locked in Lido has remained stable: It began the year at 4.9 million ether on Jan. 1, and is now around 5.19 million ether. Rocket Pool staked ether rose from around 472,000 to 608,000 during the same time period.  Click here to read the full article.

42414485,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB7Scc,1676247816,SEC to Sue Crypto Trust Co. Paxos Over Binance Stablecoin: WSJ,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to sue stablecoin issuer Paxos, which is behind the Pax dollar (USDP) and Binance USD (BUSD) tokens, over the latter stablecoin, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.  An SEC spokesperson told CoinDesk the commission does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.  The SEC is alleging that BUSD is an unregistered security, according to the report. The news comes days after CoinDesk reported Paxos is under investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services, although the scope of NYDFS' investigation is unclear.  BUSD is a Binance-branded stablecoin issued by Paxos, a New York-regulated trust company that also enjoys a provisional charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal bank regulator.  Following the news of SEC's intentions, Paxos said it would halting the minting of new BUSD tokens.  A Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk: “BUSD is a stablecoin wholly owned and managed by Paxos. As a result, BUSD market cap will only decrease over time. Paxos will continue to service the product, manage redemptions, and will follow-up with additional information as required. Paxos also assured the funds are safe, and fully covered by reserves in their banks.  “Given the ongoing regulatory uncertainty in certain markets, we will be reviewing other projects in those jurisdictions to ensure our users are insulated from further undue harm.""  Sunday's news comes right after the SEC settled charges with crypto exchange Kraken, when the regulator alleged its staking services were an offering of unregistered securities. Kraken did not admit or deny the charges under the terms of the settlement, but did shut down all of its U.S. staking programs.  Binance acknowledged last month that it had not always maintained the proper balance to back Binance-Peg BUSD (PBUSD), a wrapped version of BUSD offered on non-Ethereum networks that is backed by BUSD. After Bloomberg reported that there were issues with how PBUSD's backing was displayed, Binance said ""on occasion in the past, there was a timing mismatch in backing Binance-Peg BUSD with BUSD."" The crypto exchange claimed in a blog post that while there were issues in ""the publicly viewable data,"" user redemptions were not affected.
