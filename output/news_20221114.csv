The market is now trying to figure out who is next. Some believe Crypto.com may also be experiencing solvency issues. Crypto.com has a large position in Shiba Inu. According to CEO Kris Marszalek the position is due to customer buying. The DeFi TVL on Cronos blockchain is at an all-time high, but the footprint is concentrated to one very risky protocol. I believe last week is going to go down as one of the most important in crypto history. The collapse of FTX (FTT-USD) is likely going to create ripple effects throughout the rest of the crypto market and it could potentially even have an impact on traditional finance. The logical question now is who is next? Over the summer, we saw the collapse of Terra ( LUNC-USD ) result in a contagion effect that also took out 3 Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital ( VGX-USD )( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) , and Celsius Network ( CEL-USD ). The FTX collapse has weighed heavily on the entire crypto industry over the last week. While the bear case for FTX Token is self-evident at this point, one coin that was hit particularly hard because of FTX was Solana ( SOL-USD ). While there is good reason for that, if Solana's network metrics were performing better, SOL may have shown better resiliency. Crypto investors are now looking at other centralized custodians and wondering if we may see history repeat. Much of the noise online about the next potential shoe to drop has been popular exchange Crypto.com ( CRO-USD ). The token has taken a beating because of that speculation. CRO Daily (TradingView) On the chart, we can see $0.10 has served as support during this big downturn following the liquidation events from this summer. That support has broken and CRO appears to be entering a freefall as well. There's actually good reason to wonder if Crypto.com is having problems. We know from recent reporting by Ad Age the company has been scaling back ad-spending and cutting its staff. In the months that followed, Crypto.com quietly downsized many of the partnership deals intended to garner mainstream attention for the brand, and in some cases the firm has attempted to pull out from these deals altogether, according to details shared by former and current employees at the company who spoke with Ad Age on the condition of anonymity. This is not a good look but it doesn't mean the company is going out of business. It could actually be an indication that Crypto.com has been trying to be more responsible with expenses given the broad market declines of the last several months. Similarities to FTX Like FTX, Crypto.com is a well-known centralized crypto exchange. Also like FTX, the company has committed a lot of money through its marketing department. Crypto.com owns the naming rights to the arena where the NBA's Lakers, Clippers, and NHL's Kings play. This is among other sports sponsorship deals that include FIFA and Formula 1. Just like FTX before, we're starting to see funds moving out of known Crypto.com wallet addresses. These are just the Ethereum (ETH-USD) addresses associated with Crypto.com: Platform Outflow (Dune Analytics/Jim Toshi) After a big spike in fund flow on Friday, we've seen three consecutive days of outflow and the worst of it is actually within the last 24 hours - with over $121 million coming out of Crypto.com just in the last day. However, while there are some similarities with FTX from both a marketing strategy and asset outflow problem, we are told there are key differences as well. Differences from FTX? On one hand it probably isn't fair to assume Crypto.com is structured as poorly as FTX simply because it's a crypto business. On the other hand, how many times do market participants need to learn the same lesson on self-custody? Early this morning Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek did an AMA and explained how Crypto.com is different from FTX: We are not a hedge fund. We do not trade customers' assets. We also kept reserves 1:1 and that's very true today. What we don't know yet is what Crypto.com's corporate obligations are. Marszalek said in the AMA that we can expect liabilities clarity in the next few weeks and he also said the company doesn't collateralize the CRO token. I'd say these are generally positive signs for the customers of the Crypto.com platform. But it still does require trust in both Marszalek and the platform itself to justify keeping assets stored there. To its credit, Crypto.com has worked with Nansen to provide a live dashboard of the company's self-reported crypto wallet addresses. This allows anyone to see the assets the company has in reserve. It is good transparency, but it does raise another question: Crypto.com Holdings (Nansen) A big concern I see on this token allocation is nearly 22% of the company's $2.3 billion assets in Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD ). SHIB is yet another dog-money meme coin that I personally wouldn't recommend going anywhere near. But if you are bullish SHIB and worried about Crypto.com's solvency, this revelation could be cause for concern. Contagion Risk To Shiba Inu? Even though I don't personally see a need to have SHIB exposure, there are others who disagree. For them, the crypto.com position in Shiba Inu becomes more interesting. With a $2.3 billion balance sheet and 21.74% exposure to SHIB, Crypto.com's SHIB position is roughly $500 million - or a little under 10% of SHIB's fully diluted market valuation according to CoinMarketCap . Crypto.com and its users have a very large ability to move the SHIB price lower if those assets get sold. This isn't quite as large as Binance's FTT position as a percent of FTT's market cap a week ago, but it's bigger than Alameda Research's SOL position was. Alameda Research had a $1.2 billion SOL position while Solana's fully diluted cap was about $17 billion at the end of June. Since Alameda Research had such a large position in SOL and needed to liquidate assets to defend its FTT position, SOL's price experienced more than a 60% drawdown over the course of just a few days. In this morning's AMA, Kris Marszalek said Crypto.com's SHIB position is so large because that's what the customers on the platform are buying and the company needs to allocate to that asset accordingly in its reserves so that when customers want their SHIB, the company actually has it. If we trust Marszalek isn't acting nefariously, there shouldn't be as much risk in Crypto.com defaulting on customer obligations if the company truly has a 1:1 reserve ratio even if the run on assets on Crypto.com continues and customers start taking self-custody of their SHIB. Even if Crypto.com does actually have solvency problems like FTX, I don't necessarily see a Solana-like risk here for Shiba Inu unless Crypto.com starts selling the SHIB without customer permission. But that would be an indication of much more severe problems and I view that outcome as very unlikely despite what we just witnessed last week from a peer. CRO Utility I've covered CRO before for Seeking Alpha. That coverage was not positive of the token because staking the asset in Crypto.com's earning ecosystem had become far more expensive than it was previously. Since that article, the rewards have increased slightly on the lower tiered Visa ( V ) cards but it still isn't economical to take advantage of that offer in my view. That may be why CRO makes up such a small portion of Crypto.com's token allocation. Clients aren't holding it anymore because there isn't much reason to. ETH Wallets (Nansen) Just 3.7%, or $54 million, of the $1.5 billion Ethereum-based assets on crypto.com are CRO token. Even though I don't see much purpose as an exchange token, CRO is still utilized in the Cronos ecosystem. CRO TVL (DeFi Llama) Despite the large declines in the price of the coin, the TVL measured in CRO is actually now at an all-time high after spiking from 6.75 billion CRO to over 10.42 billion CRO in the last 5 days. Still I would exercise a lot of caution before buying the CRO dip. 54%, or $360 million, of the TVL on Cronos is attributable to one protocol: VVS Finance (VVS-USD), an entity that appears to be a classic high-APY, yield farming protocol destined to fall apart. Summary If you're a Crypto.com user, I recommend using it as an on-ramp not as an asset custodian - at least not with a significant portion of your funds. Crypto.com's token has been taken to the woodshed over the last few days and you could argue the selloff is overdone given the severity of the decline. But I'd caution buying CRO for its potential utility on the Cronos blockchain. With 75% of the blocks coming from just three entities, the blockchain validation is highly centralized and the DeFi footprint looks to be mostly attributable to the kind of risky protocols that Alameda Research was playing with. While we don't know what the other side of Crypto.com's balance sheet looks like, even if the company is solvent I don't see a big reason to buy CRO. I'm not a fan of SHIB either but I don't think SHIB will get the same treatment from Crypto.com that SOL got from Alameda Research.",NEGATIVE,SHIB | SOL | CRO,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | SHIB | SOL | CRO,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4557684-are-cronos-and-shiba-unu-next-ftx-and-solana?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4243714.jpeg

42388631,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ0Zb,1668468657,"FTX Hacker Panicked, Still Holds $339M in Ether, Cryptos: Arkham Intelligence","The mysterious looter of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, who is likely an insider according to a blockchain expert, holds $339 million of digital assets that they drained from the exchange late Friday, according to crypto intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence.  Arkham found that the wallets associated with the exploiter hold $215 million in ETH, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, $48 million in Maker’s stablecoin DAI, $44 million in BNB, the Binance ecosystem’s native token, $4 million in Tether’s USDT stablecoin on the Avalanche blockchain and $3.8 million of MATIC on Polygon’s Matic bridge.  Some $20 million in PAXG, a Paxos stablecoin linked to the price of gold, was frozen when Paxos was ordered to blacklist the accounts by U.S. authorities, preventing the holder from moving or cashing out the tokens.  Late Friday night, the insolvent crypto exchange FTX of Sam Bankman-Fried, suffered suspicious outflows exceeding $600 million, as CoinDesk reported. One entity at the center of the exploit siphoned off about $400 million from the exchange’s crypto wallets. The attack came after FTX, and the other 137 firms of Bankman-Fried’s crypto conglomerate, filed for bankruptcy protection the same day.  Read more: 'FTX Has Been Hacked': Crypto Disaster Worsens as Exchange Sees Mysterious Outflows Exceeding $600M  The hacker acted hastily based on their behavior on the blockchain, according to Arkham’s report. They used various decentralized exchanges to convert tokens, including UniSwap, 1inch and CowSwap, and struggled to dump coins such as MATIC, LINK and PAXG divided into smaller amounts to prevent losses from slippage.  After tracing the attacker’s blockchain transactions, Arkham found that they “appeared to be in panic” and “lost a large amount of their token holdings” when they moved assets across different chains to avoid getting caught. In a likely attempt to consolidate their holdings, they also converted tokens to ETH and DAI on the Ethereum network, movements that cannot be easily sanctioned by authorities.  “It is becoming clearer by the day that the FTX exploiter is not very sophisticated,” Miguel Morel, chief executive of Arkham Intelligence, told CoinDesk. “They've hastily tried to do whatever they can with the funds, seemingly without much of a plan.”  The attacker also seemingly committed at least one amateur misstep. They flippantly tapped their verified personal account on crypto exchange Kraken to send enough TRX tokens to cover transaction fees, according to Dyma Budorin, CEO of blockchain security audit firm Hacken.  The unsophisticated maneuvers imply that there may be some hope to reclaim the funds the hacker took.  “I think it's only a matter of time before they're discovered due to their use of various off-ramps, and at that point it will just be about recovering the funds,” Morel said.

42411699,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJcn,1668467964,Proof of Reserves Explained,"Crypto exchanges can go bust when they do not have the funds to fulfill customer withdrawals. This is a significant problem if you are a customer of a crypto exchange and have entrusted the company with your coins, only to learn later that the exchange had squandered all the money ferried through its platform.  These companies appear to have a habit of hiding their reserves or outright lying about them. An exchange may have used your money to prop up its failing trading firm, as happened with FTX. They may have accidentally wired hundreds of millions of dollars worth of customer funds to another exchange, as befell Crypto.com, or lost it all in a hack, as happened with Mt. Gox.  See Also: Let’s Actually Commit to Proofs of Reserve This Time, Okay?  Even regular audits or attestations by third parties may not suffice. The companies may have tricked the auditors: Perhaps they only moved funds into the right wallets just in time for the third party to tick the box that claims the funds are in the right place, then invested money in risky funds.  Remember: Crypto exchanges are not the same as banks. For starters, crypto isn’t insured by government depositary schemes. Accordingly, customers must take due diligence matters into their own hands when choosing where to park their money. They need to check the exchange's terms of service and see what guarantees the exchange is making about holding their funds. Even then, they have to trust that the exchange will live up to the promise of those terms.  But what if customers could verifiably track the location of their funds in real-time?  Enter proof-of-reserves and Merkle trees  Several crypto exchanges are advocating for a form of transparency called proof-of-reserves. This is a cryptographic method of proving that an exchange is liquid enough to process all customer withdrawals, and otherwise allows customers of a cryptocurrency exchange to keep tabs on where their money really is.  One way of doing this involves using something called Merkle trees. These produce efficient data structures called “hash trees” that can be securely verified; these structures, kind of like a map of customers’ funds, work even when the reserves become complicated.  The idea is that, following the publication of a proof-of-reserves certificate, anyone could follow the money and work out how much crypto an exchange holds. In effect, it is a bona fide verification tool to prevent exchanges from surreptitiously running off with customer deposits.  Kraken’s proof-of-reserve report from August 2022, for instance, attested that “Kraken retained custody over a sufficient amount of the in-kind assets to cover the in-scope client liabilities as observed within the database related to Kraken’s spot exchange.” In other words, a third party said that Kraken has enough crypto to cover all current customer withdrawals.  Although proposals for proof-of-reserves often require the hiring of a third-party attestor to confirm that the on-chain funds actually match up with what the exchange claims to hold, the improvement on the current system would be on-demand, real-time tracking of exchange reserves.  In effect, proof-of-reserves brings crypto exchanges closer to the treasuries of decentralized finance protocols, where all funds are matched to cryptocurrency wallets that anyone can trace on-chain at any time.  The idea for proof-of-reserves based on Merkle trees became particularly popular after the collapse of FTX. Binance’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, tweeted that his exchange would begin to implement proof-of-reserves.  According to a spokesperson, its reserves “would be audited by a third-party vendor with user verification available on third-party platforms to verify and audit our customer holdings.” The world’s largest crypto exchange will first verify BTC reserves.  After Binance announced its intentions, nine other exchanges, including KuCoin, OKX and Gate.io, announced similar plans. Some, like Gate.io, opted for auditor-assisted proof-of-reserve validation, while others, such as BitMEX, said they will attest to the reserves themselves.  To be clear, Merkle tree-based proof-of-reserve would not prevent the misappropriation of customer funds completely. It only tracks holdings and would not prevent an exchange from, say, lending money to dodgy borrowers who have no hope of repaying.  And proof-of-reserve does not provide customers with greater control over their funds; it just provides information.  Even if FTX had implemented proof-of-reserve (in addition to its audited financials), a customer would simply have been able to watch their crypto going for a quick walk off a cliff – but that customer wouldn’t have been able to prevent it from happening in the first place.  Ultimately, a proof-of-reserve is only as good as its verifier. A crypto exchange could lie outright, and a third-party attestor could still uphold the lie. If the attester is corrupt or incompetent, perhaps by overlooking missing wallets or failing to understand how an exchange had structured customer holdings, the whole purpose of proof of reserve would be undermined.

42388645,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ1YP,1668467844,Sam Bankman-Fried’s Unceremonious Exit Leaves ‘Alameda Gap’ in Crypto Markets,"Call it the “Alameda gap.”  Last week’s collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading firm, Alameda Research, has left such a big hole in cryptocurrency markets that trading liquidity has thinned noticeably, according to a new report from Kaiko.  The drop in liquidity over the past week is far larger than in any previous market drawdown, and it could be “here to stay” in the short term, according to Kaiko – especially since other trading firms including Amber Group and Genesis Trading have reported funds being trapped on FTX.  Since Nov. 5, bitcoin liquidity within 2% of the mid-price has fallen from 11,800 BTC to 7,000 BTC, the lowest since early June, according to Kaiko, which analyzed data from 18 crypto exchanges.  Kraken’s bitcoin (BTC) market depth has fallen by 57%, Bitstamp’s by 32%, Binance’s by 25%, and Coinbase’s by 18%, according to the report.  Kaiko said ether (ETH) markets were also affected by the collapse, with 2% market depth, falling to late May levels.  BTC’s price fell more than 21% in the past seven days, trading around $16,200 as of Monday midday, while ETH was down 23% over the past week to $1,210.  Altcoins get hurt more  Kaiko said liquidity in altcoins might be “more concerning,” especially those that were significant holdings of Alameda, such as Solana’s SOL.  SOL’s total market depth has fallen 50% from 1 million SOL to under 500,000 SOL aggregated across all order books, according to Kaiko: “This drop was felt on every single exchange.”  Solan's SRM and MAPS tokens have also seen a plunge in depth, the report noted.  Solana’sSOL token dropped as low as $12.08 in the past 24 hours, hitting its lowest level in over 20 months, before settling back to about $13 Monday. SRM was one of the biggest losers in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) as its price fell 22% in the past 24 hours to $0.16.  “Alameda held a huge amount of illiquid tokens while (almost certainly) being a market maker for these same tokens, which put the firm in a nearly impossible position when faced with insolvency,” the report added.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, said that market liquidity levels may stay under pressure until the Federal Reserve tempers its campaign to tighten monetary conditions.  “Even though the sentiment has been dented overall, the market will eventually recover, especially as macro contributors, like the Fed easing up on interest hikes, become dominant,” he said. “We expect the liquidity to remain relatively dry until the market begins to pick up and market confidence is restored.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/14/sam-bankman-frieds-unceremonious-exit-leaves-alameda-gap-in-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5466997a3ddbf3007ff71193a1aa165afe851d3-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world is going to become digital with crypto playing a major role in the evolution of information technology. The change cannot be stopped. Regulation, however, must be a part of the mix and to provide the regulation needed is going to require intelligence and persistence. Unfortunately, many investors may be hurt in the transformation to the ""new"" world. Regulators are facing something that they have never really faced before: globalization. The collapse of the crypto exchange FTX (FTT-USD), which filed bankruptcy in the U.S. on Friday, has set the scene. The regulators cannot back off now. Events are thrusting markets into places of no return. First, the regulators are dealing with modern information technology. The advancements in this space are enormous and are a challenge to oversee even in their simplest form. But, the evolution of modern information technology advancements is global in nature and hence is outside of any real geographic oversight. As Martin Arnold states in the Financial Times (subscription required) , ""One of the biggest problems confronting regulators (is) the difficulty in pinning down where many crypto asset providers were based."" Historically, regulation is set up for specific legal entities and specific geographic territories. This specificity does not exist for current crypto asset providers. In the case of FTX, there is a ""multi-jurisdictional web of wholly owned subsidiaries and intercompany loans including entities in the Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Antigua and Barbuda, as well as the U.S. Japan, Germany, and Switzerland."" Modern information technology is global and must be perceived to operate in a global fashion. Attempts The European Union ""is finishing legislation to bring crypto asset providers under a regulatory framework for the first time, known as Markets in Crypto-Assets, which will replace a patchwork of national rules."" But, Andrea Enria, chair of the European Central Bank's supervisory board, said that he was proud that the EU was the first jurisdiction to ""bring these entities under some form of supervision."" However, Mr. Enria predicted that the whole effort ""would be an interesting challenge."" One problem, however, is that some providers are threatening to ""route more of its European customers' trading via its offshore entities if EU regulation tried to force it to provide much more euro-denominated issuance."" As I mentioned above, this situation is a global one, not just constrained to local geographic boundaries. The U.S. is trailing further behind the ECB. The World But, the problem is not going to go away. As I have written many times before, the future is digital. This movement cannot be stopped. The crypto-world is going to expand, and the existing banking world is, somehow, going to have to be integrated with it. This should not be a ""surprise conclusion."" One of the problems with creating the ""new"" world that is a regulated world is that there is so much money floating around the world that ""players"" in the crypto-world have resources available to them to push things to the limit. I have not backed-off from my claim that the crypto-bubble took advantage of the Federal Reserve efforts to protect the world from a Covid-19 based financial crisis . Unfortunately, all this liquidity floating around is providing crypto-players to take advantage of opportunities that are available to them. FTX was just one of the players that were able to take advantage of all the money floating around. But, the situation is getting more serious. The crypto world must be brought under control. This, I believe, is going to be quite some battle. Unfortunately, this battle is going to be taking place at the same time that world central banks are facing very severe inflationary problems. The world is in a great disequilibrium and these are going to have to be worked out over time. My concern is that many are going to suffer a lot of pain. How this pain will be avoided is a real problem.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4557673-regulators-will-continue-to-struggle-with-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4241879.jpeg
42388629,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ0Uv,1668466560,"Bitcoin Mining Firm TeraWulf Raised $17M of Capital in Q3, But Cash Reserves Remain Low","Bitcoin mining company TeraWulf (WULF) raised $17 million in capital in the third quarter, but its liquidity remains at $4.5 million, according to a statement on its third quarter earnings released after the market close on Monday.  The $17 million came from $9.5 million in equity from existing investors and $7.5 million of incremental proceeds under a term loan. The Monday statement said that $138.5 million of principal under the term loan was outstanding at the end of the quarter.  Cash flow has proven to be a key determinant of miners' ability to navigate the bear market, with some major miners facing liquidity crises that could even lead them to bankruptcy.  TeraWulf's costs of revenue increased dramatically in the quarter as energy prices in New York State, where it mainly operates, soared while it increased its energy demand with new operations. The miner paid 134% in costs per dollar of revenue, compared to 43% in Q2. The miner is trying to bring costs down for 2023, the statement said.  In the same quarter, TeraWulf significantly increased its hashrate, or computing power, and energy capacity that could be used for deploying mining machines. About 50 megawatts (MW) of power were brought online at its mining facility in Lake Mariner in upstate New York. The company had 11,000 miners operating at the end of the quarter, and another 9,000 are scheduled to be plugged into the 50 MW in Lake Mariner. As a result of the expansion, WULF mined 117 bitcoin in the third quarter, compared to 29 in the second quarter.  WULF share prices were down 0.8% in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq on Monday.  TeraWulf also said it ""right-sized"" its investment in a joint venture with a subsidiary of Talen Energy to 25%. The venture relates to a 200 MW mine in Pennsylvania, dubbed Nautilus.  The miners' computing power goal for the first quarter of 2023 remained unchanged at 5.8 exahash/second (EH/s).  TeraWulf is one of the most indebted publicly listed miners compared with its equity, data analyzed by CoinDesk in June showed.

42388643,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ1P3,1668466002,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holds Steady Through FTX Gloom,"Price Action  Bitcoin, ether and most other major cryptos were holding steady, even as investors wrestled with the widening gloom from exchange giant FTX’s implosion.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently holding steady above its most recent $16,000 support, up a fraction of a percentage point over the past 24 hours, although some crypto market observers believe that it could dip to lower levels.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  “We have seen broader market instability despite some positive macro developments for risk assets as a whole,” David Duong, head of institutional research, at crypto exchange Coinbase, wrote, adding: “It’s still emerging which counterparties may have lent or interacted with either FTX or Alameda (FTX’s sibling company) and what those exact liabilities are. BTC could not only retest 2022 lows but touch the $13K level. We think there is support at $13.5K.""  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,200, up slightly. The second-largest crypto in market value and other major altcoins have been caught in the FTX fallout. The exchange filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday, suffered a major hack over the weekend and is the target of regulators worldwide.  SRM led a rogues’ gallery of tokens in the red, recently falling close to 20%. On Saturday, DeFi protocols across the Solana ecosystem began unplugging from Serum for fear that they didn’t know who wielded control – a concern fueled by the late-Friday hack at FTX. The Solana Foundation said Monday it has tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies stranded on FTX – as well as 3.24 million common stock shares in Sam Bankman-Fried’s bankrupt crypto exchange.  Embattled crypto lender Celsius’ CEL token was down nearly as much, while FTX’s FTT coin fell more than 13% to $1.27, a fraction of its pricing near $36 earlier in the year. XRP was recently up more than 10%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was trading flat.  Equity markets broke a recent trend upward with the Nasdaq dropping 1.1%, and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average declining 0.8 and 0.6%, respectively after online retailer Amazon pushed forward with layoffs, part of a larger cost-cutting campaign tied to the company’s pessimistic expectations for the months ahead.  FTX’s collapse doesn't mean it will be the end for crypto, venture capitalist Kevin O’Leary told CoinDesk TV’s First Mover program, describing the debacle as a “defining” moment that will “stabilize” the industry.  “This does not kill crypto,” added O’Leary, who said that he had considered rescuing FTX before SEC chief Gary Gensler highlighted anew the industry’s lack of regulation. “There’s going to be a silver lining to this disaster. There’s no question about it. It’ll be called regulation.”  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 836.53 +3.0 ▲ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,390 +34.3 ▲ 0.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,223 +4.0 ▲ 0.3% S&P 500 daily close  3,957.25 −35.7 ▼ 0.9% Gold  $1,775 +8.7 ▲ 0.5% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.87% ▲ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Technical Take  Crypto Turns to an Oil-Patch Tradition to Right Itself  By Glenn Williams Jr.  The growing push for crypto firms to adopt proof-of-reserves balance sheet validation emulates a practice long used in the physical commodities world.  The commodities industry has been using validation for years to assure investors of their solvency and build confidence in those markets and companies. That bitcoin and ether are often referred to as “digital gold” and “digital oil” now seems more appropriate than ever.  Oil and gas entities attest to their reserve balances at the end of each year. Investors, analysts and traders are accustomed to reading through these attestations and determining the extent to which a firm’s valuation may or may not have changed.  Below is the most recent oil and gas proved reserves report for the U.S., released Jan. 13, 2022. As you can see, the U.S. proved reserves declined 19% between Dec. 31, 2019 and Dec. 31, 2020.

42389626,6F4ZR09tPAWQmeXaoSbQ1w,1668465213,'Big Short' Author Michael Lewis Spent Months With FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried and Is Writing a Book,"Best-selling author Michael Lewis may have lucked into the story of a lifetime – quite the development given he has already published a long string of hit books including “The Big Short” and “Flash Boys.”  Lewis, according to a letter from Creative Artists Agency circulating in Hollywood, has just spent the past six months or so “traveling with and interviewing Sam Bankman-Fried,” the former billionaire whose cryptocurrency empire dramatically blew up this month after a CoinDesk scoop spurred fear that his business was built on a house of cards.  The Ankler, an entertainment industry newsletter, reported first on the existence of the letter, saying it was sent Friday to potential buyers of film rights for the book. CoinDesk subsequently verified that the letter was indeed sent.  “His childhood, early success on Wall Street, embrace of effective altruism and the creation of a crypto empire that catapulted him in record time into the ranks of the richest people in the world seemed more than sufficient for a signature Michael Lewis book,” the letter said. “The events of the past week have provided a dramatic surprise ending to the story.”  The letter added: “Michael hasn’t written anything yet, but the story has become too big for us to wait.”  A voicemail message left with a senior publicist at Lewis’ publisher, W. W. Norton & Co., wasn’t returned.  There has been speculation for months that Lewis was profiling Bankman-Fried. When asked about that by CoinDesk in September, Bankman-Fried declined to comment.  Lewis is one of the most successful and famous non-fiction writers around. His first book, “Liar’s Poker,” was about his time as a bond trader. “The Big Short” told the story of investors who successfully bet on the housing market blowing up in 2008, and “Flash Boys” described how computer-driven traders transformed Wall Street and highlighted an effort to fight back.  Lewis often builds his books around scrappy upstarts who challenge the status quo, like baseball executive Billy Beane from “Moneyball,” who helped popularize a more analytical approach to evaluating players, or Brad Katsuyama from “Flash Boys,” whose startup IEX – which Bankman-Fried’s FTX US agreed to invest in this year, creating a connection of sorts to Lewis – took on Wall Street incumbents like the New York Stock Exchange.  Lewis already said he planned to write a book that would discuss crypto. “I found a character through whom I can write about – it weirdly links up ‘Flash Boys,’ ‘The Big Short’ and ‘Liar’s Poker,’” he told Financial News in an interview published in August.  “I guess it is possible it will be framed as a crypto book, but it won’t be a crypto book,” Lewis told Financial News. “It’ll be about this really unusual character. You’ll learn all about crypto and you’ll learn about what screwed up market structure in the United States and so on.”  Lewis interviewed Bankman-Fried on stage in the Bahamas – where Bankman-Fried ran the business – at an FTX conference held in April. “There’s a status upheaval in the financial world, and you’re sitting right in the middle of it,” Lewis said to Bankman-Fried. Lewis was later seen sitting in the audience, writing in his notebook.  Bankman-Fried’s business failed partly because Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of bigger crypto exchange Binance, said he planned to sell his holdings of a token issued by FTX. Chaos ensued, and Binance announced a deal to bail out FTX – which was withdrawn the next day.  Referring to Bankman-Fried and Zhao, the letter circulating in Hollywood said Lewis “likens them to the Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader of crypto.”  Read more: Bankman-Fried’s Cabal of Roommates in the Bahamas Ran His Crypto Empire – and Dated.

42388640,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ1B1,1668464879,White House Goes Back to the Future With FDIC Chair Pick Gruenberg,"President Joe Biden has chosen to nominate Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) Acting Chairman Martin Gruenberg to return to the chairmanship he held in previous administrations.  Gruenberg, who has served on the FDIC board for a record 17 years after working for Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, has been a reliable proponent of tougher financial rules, though his position on cryptocurrencies hasn’t been fully fleshed out. In an October speech on crypto issues, he said stablecoins could have such a profound effect on the banking system that U.S. regulators need to make sure the digital tokens fit in without disruption.  Under Gruenberg’s leadership as the interim head of the board, which has continued long after his own board term expired at the end of 2018, the FDIC also went after some crypto firms – including the now-disgraced FTX – that the agency claimed misrepresented how customers may be protected by deposit insurance.  The FDIC will have a key role in how crypto will mesh with the U.S. banking system. That work will have significant influence over how stablecoin rules are eventually implemented.  The White House sent Gruenberg’s nominations for his board seat and the five-year chairmanship to the Senate for confirmation on Monday. The so-called lame duck period of Congress, in which the last weeks of this session are completed before the newly elected members arrive in January, has begun. Narrow control of next year’s Senate will remain with Democrats.  The Biden Administration has had a mixed record of getting its financial regulator nominees through the Senate confirmation process. A pick for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Saule Omarova, and one for the Federal Reserve’s bank-supervision role, Sarah Bloom Raskin, failed to reach a vote. But Michael Barr – a former adviser to Ripple – had at first faced pushback as a potential candidate to run the OCC, then won confirmation when he was nominated for the Federal Reserve job.  Gruenberg, who was confirmed previously as FDIC chairman in 2012, was embroiled in some controversy at the start of this administration when he and the Democratic chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sought to move a bank-merger policy without support of the FDIC chairman at the time, Jelena McWilliams. McWilliams subsequently resigned.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) praised the Gruenberg pick, saying he “has spent his entire career fighting for American consumers, and he is well equipped to continue defending the banking system from new and existing threats.”  However, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors pointed out that nominating him means “none of the nominees to the FDIC Board will meet the requirement for state bank supervisory experience.” Biden had previously nominated Travis Hill as vice chairman and Jonathan McKernan as a board member, which would fill out the five-member board.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/14/white-house-goes-back-to-the-future-with-fdic-chair-pick-gruenberg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/121fc4f8d0cfb824ecce1dd926f6551e489834c2-6684x4609.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42420783,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYGvV,1668464616,Ukrainian Official Refutes FTX-Ukraine Money Laundering Rumors,"Alex Bornyakov, deputy minister of digital transformation of Ukraine, took to Twitter Monday night to officially deny a conspiracy theory around the country's crypto fundraising effort.  ""A fundraising crypto foundation @_AidForUkraine used @FTX_Official to convert crypto donations into fiat in March. Ukraine's gov never invested any funds into FTX. The whole narrative that Ukraine allegedly invested in FTX, who donated money to Democrats is nonsense, frankly,"" Bornyakov tweeted, ending with a ""facepalm"" emoji.  Last week, a theory spread on Twitter and right-wing websites suggesting the U.S. government's massive aid to the besieged nation rebounded to the U.S. Democratic party via the failed FTX crypto exchange, which was an official partner of Ukrainian government for the crypto fundraising campaign.  FTX filed for bankruptcy last week following CoinDesk's report that the balance sheet of FTX sister company Alameda Research held a surprisingly large amount of FTT, an exchange token issued by FTX. Soon after that, FTT tanked, spiraling a crisis of liquidity on the exchange and a collapse in the company's value.  Neither Ukrainian government nor FTX ever announced an investment event of any sorts. Such a move would have been extravagant for a nation fielding a full-scale military invasion from Russia using military and financial aid from the U.S., E.U., U.K. and other countries, observers have been quick to point out.  Ukraine, which raised hundreds of millions in crypto this spring, in addition to a traditional fiat campaign to support its military and civilian population, partnered with FTX in March to cash out crypto donations and turn them into ammunition and humanitarian aid. FTX, along with the Ukrainian exchange Kuna, became a platform for turning crypto into actual goods for the nation at war.  As CoinDesk earlier reported, FTX was used as a platform for merchants, which would register an account and receive payment for their goods in crypto. Then those merchants could immediately turn it into fiat if they wanted, according to the technical lead of Ukrainian government's crypto fundraise Michael Chobanyan, CEO of Kuna.  Chobanyan confirmed to CoinDesk that FTX role was limited to a fiat off-ramp: Kuna would send crypto their to get cash and pay for things the army needed.

Present were committee chair Harriet Baldwin – a conservative member of parliament – along with other members of that committee. Testifying were Daniel Trinder, vice president of government affairs of Europe at Binance, Susan Friedman, head of policy at payments network Ripple, Ian Taylor, executive director of lobby group CryptoUK and Tim Grant, head of Europe at Galaxy Digital.  “This is the exchange collapsing Ian, must feel a bit awkward coming in talking to us after last week,” Baldwin said. She also fired off other questions to the group, such as if the events surrounding FTX undermined confidence in what they do for a living.  “I think it would be very wrong to tar the entire industry by this one bad apple, which happened to be a very big apple,” Grant said.

Plus, Taylor and Binance’s Trinder also said crypto firms needed auditing.  The committee also asked Trinder if Binance knew its actions – 1) Unloading on the markets much of its holdings of FTX exchange token FTT, and 2) Agreeing to and then backing out of a deal to bailout/acquire FTX – might lead to the collapse of that exchange.  Trinder denied such intention and offered to quickly send the committee related correspondence documents to justify that Binance’s actions were not fuelled by the intention to destroy its competitor.

42420873,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZBV,1668460025,Market Analysis: Crypto Turns to an Oil-Patch Tradition to Right Itself,"The growing push for crypto firms to adopt proof-of-reserves balance sheet validation emulates a practice long used in the physical commodities world.  The initiative, which none other than Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has been pushing and that venture capitalist Nic Carter addresses in this CoinDesk opinion piece, would require exchanges to verify their assets. FTX’s implosion over the last 10 days – a result of propping up the affiliated trading firm Alameda Research with its own FTT tokens – raised the question about an industry-wide epidemic of balance sheets being out-of-whack or improperly managed. The current, intense period of reassessment will likely morph from “who uses proof-of-reserves” to “who uses it most often.”  The commodities industry has been using validation for years to assure investors of their solvency and build confidence in those markets and companies. That bitcoin and ether are often referred to as “digital gold” and “digital oil” now seems more appropriate than ever.  Oil and gas entities attest to their reserve balances at the end of each year. Investors, analysts and traders are accustomed to reading through these attestations and determining the extent to which a firm’s valuation may or may not have changed.  Below is the most recent oil and gas proved reserves report for the U.S., released Jan. 13, 2022. As you can see, the U.S. proved reserves declined 19% between Dec. 31, 2019 and Dec. 31, 2020.  “Proved reserves” are widely recognized as having a 90% chance of successful extraction. Lower tier categories, “probable” and “possible” reserves, denote much lower probabilities of success, but are often justifiably excluded from a company’s valuation.  Standardization of definitions and methodology in determining reserve balances is key for the system’s success, ensuring that analysts and investors can evaluate entities versus each other, and monitor trends on an apples-to-apples basis.  The myriad issues that the crypto sector has faced over the last six months appear to be individual- and entity-based, and not asset-based. Bitcoin and ether continue to operate as intended.  Cryptocurrencies' efficacy as mediums of exchange, units of account and vessels to store value remain intact. Decentralized finance, which operates on code, fared especially well during the turmoil, although the odds of DeFi being carved out of the criticism caused by centralized failures are low. Crises have a way of sweeping up everything in their path.  Below ground, above board  The analogy between a crypto-based proof-of-reserves audit, and that of an oilfield is not perfect.  A dollar value is often assigned to an energy company's reserves by projecting out future cash flows and discounting them by 10%. For centralized crypto firms, marking the daily value of reserves to markets could be more straighforward.  Oil reserves also require extraction, which creates the delineation between proved, probable, possible and other reserve categories; there's some degree of subjectivity when it comes to geological modeling tools and rock formations hundreds or thousands of feet below the ground. Proof-of-reserves for digital assets more closely resembles an audit of assets that have already been extracted.  Finally, a natural lag exists in the auditing of energy reserves. The table above, while most recent, reflects U.S. energy reserves as of 2020.  Proof-of-reserves can be executed far more frequently within crypto – maybe even weekly or daily or in real time. Certain exchanges have already gone as far as adopting daily attestation of crypto reserves.  The differences could work to the crypto industry’s advantage, allowing exchange users and other observers to track assets precisely on an ongoing basis. Attestations may serve as a worthy beginning point for crypto that follows a sound process, rather than relying on the strength of personality to foster faith in a fledgling industry that still leaves most people feeling squirmy.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/14/market-analysis-crypto-turns-to-an-oil-patch-tradition-to-right-itself,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1bd40700c5398e33efc2ace8143e1e781b18ef4-1440x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

4236935,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4557626-bitcoin-is-basically-a-coin-flip?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1668458891,Bitcoin Is Basically A Coin Flip,"Summary Last week Bitcoin crashed as the crypto exchange FTX ran out of money and stopped processing people's withdrawals. On the day of the crash, I predicted there'd be a near term reversal, but I also called Bitcoin unsuitable for fundamental investors. Bitcoin doesn't generate cash flows, therefore it is impossible to value it. It does have two factors that could be called fundamentals--the supply cap and transactional use--but the data on the latter is hard to find. Bitcoin has practical benefits to political dissidents and people facing persecution. For investors, it's a gamble, but there are people who can benefit from owning it. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) crashed last week, as the crypto exchange FTX (FTT-USD) went broke and stopped processing withdrawals. The move was consistent with what was observed in past crypto exchange bankruptcies. Bitcoin’s price fell 43% in the first quarter of 2014, when the crypto exchange Mt. Gox collapsed ; similar price movements were observed during the Celsius (CEL-USD) bankruptcy . When I saw Bitcoin crash in the wake of FTX’s collapse, I Tweeted out that a near term reversal was likely, but that fundamental investors should stay away from Bitcoin anyway. Ultimately, the short term reversal did occur , but it reversed to the downside again later, when the Binance (BNB-USD) deal fell through. Why do I think fundamentals-oriented investors should stay away from Bitcoin, despite having predicted an upside reversal? It has to do with the factors that drive the supply and demand for Bitcoin. BTC does not generate cash flows, release earnings, or have a balance sheet. Some of the companies associated with Bitcoin have these things, but they aren’t the only factors driving BTC’s price. Primarily, the demand for BTC comes from a) speculation; b) transactional use. Unfortunately, data on the latter is nearly impossible to obtain. Sources of Bitcoin Demand The speculative demand for Bitcoin is well known. The coin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency, promoted by business celebrities like Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Cathie Wood. There are entire internet communities dedicated to talking about nothing but Bitcoin , and they have millions of users. As you might expect, there is a lot of money invested into speculating on Bitcoin’s price. The problem with speculative demand for anything is that it tends to go away. If an investor buys something hoping it will go up in the short term, they may get frustrated and sell when it instead goes down. An MIT study found that panic selling was particularly likely to occur during very large market movements. Speculative demand can evaporate for any number of reasons. It has a particularly strong tendency to dissipate in periods of monetary tightening. When interest rates go up, it becomes more expensive to borrow funds with which to speculate. This makes speculation seem “less logical” in periods of rising interest rates–like the one we’re in now. The transactional demand for Bitcoin is hard to gauge. Bitcoin’s blockchain only records exchanges of Bitcoin, it doesn’t tell you whether Bitcoin was spent on a good or sold by a trader. For this reason, it’s difficult to estimate how much Bitcoin is being spent on goods and services. A study conducted by Chainalysis found that merchants accounted for between 0.5% and 1% of all Bitcoin transactions in various countries sampled. Another study once pegged the percentage at 33%, although the link to that study (on NewsBTC) no longer works. We may never know what percentage of all Bitcoin is being used for real world transactions. Adding up merchants’ income statements provides a floor estimate, but it doesn’t capture transactions by informal businesses, who are among Bitcoin’s biggest users. Black market vendors and non-public businesses don’t release public financial statements, so we can only “see” the Bitcoin transactions being reported by public corporations, and companies that choose to make voluntary disclosures for whatever reason. In some countries, the government may release reports on how much Bitcoin revenue small businesses reported, but it’s not standard practice. The Bank of Canada, for example, has released reports on cryptocurrency , but they contain little information on transactional vs speculative use. The report just linked contains some conceptual material on Bitcoin’s transactional use, but does not include the important statistic, which is “Bitcoin spent on goods and services as a percentage of all Bitcoins exchanged.” The fact that Chainalysis’ “0.5% to 1%” estimate is only a floor might appear bullish. If we know that 1% of Bitcoin transactions are merchants’ reported amounts, then we can safely assume that the total amount (including black market and non-registered businesses) is higher. Unfortunately, the really critical issue with this floor estimate is that it underscores the difficulty in getting the true statistic. The seemingly ‘encouraging’ nature of the estimate being low, is overpowered by the unavailability of the real statistic. To do a valuation, you need hard data, and a lot of the required data for a Bitcoin valuation isn’t available. How a Fundamentals Based Valuation of Bitcoin Might Work A fundamentals based valuation of Bitcoin might work if it were possible to access transaction data and separate it from volume data. If we had the latter, we could compute a “volume to transactions ratio” which would provide a quick and easy measure of how much Bitcoin trading is used for actual purchases. Bitcoin does not generate cash flows that accrue to the holder, but it does have utility: it can be used to buy things, even if you’re unable to open a bank account. In this sense, we could think of Bitcoin as having a convenience yield , an inherent benefit of holding an asset directly. People who invest in commodities long term do not have the benefit of cash flow analysis; however, they can reasonably posit that demand for a commodity will continue to exist if the commodity has something inherently desirable about it. Bitcoin’s ability to be used in transactions, even by people without bank accounts, may be such an “inherently desirable feature.” There are many people in the world who can’t access bank accounts. Most obviously, criminals cannot access them; people accused of money laundering often have their bank accounts closed. A cynic might say, “see, the only non-speculative use case for Bitcoin is its use by criminals,” but this is missing the bigger picture. Not everybody who is treated as a criminal is actually a criminal. Sometimes, governments bring down the power of the state on political dissidents, and this use of State power often includes closing peoples’ bank accounts. The Human Rights Foundation lists at least Four different countries that close the bank accounts of political dissidents. There was one instance where a protest movement in one such country used Bitcoin to get around bank closures. The protesters in this country successfully raised $2 million in Bitcoin donations after having their bank accounts closed. To avoid getting political, I will leave the name of the country and its alleged dictator out of the article, but you can find details about the situation in this Forbes piece . The big takeaway is that Bitcoin isn’t only useful to criminals. It’s useful to anybody who has attracted the ire of governments or banks, whether they are criminals or not. Given that banks are centrally controlled organizations, it’s reasonable to assume that they will continue closing the accounts of unpopular people. Banks have the power to close peoples’ accounts, and they are run by human beings. It is therefore quite possible for them to unfairly close peoples’ accounts, human beings being as fallible as they are. Bitcoin provides a way for people shut out of the banking system to send and receive money. Therefore, it’s likely that some transactional Bitcoin use will persist. So, a fundamental analysis of Bitcoin is theoretically possible. We could treat Bitcoin’s independence of the banking system as a convenience yield, and analyze it like a commodity. Much like oil traders bet on higher oil prices when OPEC cuts output, we could bet on higher Bitcoin prices when de-banking incidents increase in major countries. Unfortunately, the data on the transactional use of Bitcoin is not obtainable. When a catalyst occurs that seems favourable to Bitcoin, you can reasonably assume its price will go up, but you can’t arrive at a specific fair value estimate. It’s for this reason that Bitcoin’s price movements are similar to coin flipping. Absent very obvious catalysts, they are fundamentally random, driven by factors that can’t be perceived. The Bottom Line The bottom line about Bitcoin is that it has some non-zero value, but it isn’t knowable. The most ardent Bitcoin bears, who see the value of BTC going to zero, ignore the real world uses that Bitcoin has. Most Bitcoin trading is speculative, but there are cases when it proves useful, most notably in countries where human rights are weakening. The situations in which Bitcoin is needed are not everyday occurrences, they are more like emergencies, but they do happen. For this reason, I do not think that Bitcoin is going to zero. I think the fair value of Bitcoin is lower than the current price, but well above $0. The problem is finding out what that fair value really is. Data on transactional use of Bitcoin is hard to find. It may be essentially impossible to find: the Bitcoin ledger doesn’t record what items Bitcoins were spent on, it only records exchanges. If a person selling things for Bitcoin doesn’t tell the government about it, then their transactional use of Bitcoin will never be recorded in a form that’s useful to statisticians. All we really know about Bitcoin is the supply cap and the trading volume, and the volume that comes from speculation can’t be assumed to last: bubbles historically tend to burst. So, Bitcoin is not a suitable asset for fundamentals-oriented investors. It lacks the data transparency required to calculate its fair value. If you’re part of a social movement, or a programmer working on blockchain technology, you may derive practical benefits from holding Bitcoin. If you’re a value investor, look elsewhere.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4557626-bitcoin-is-basically-a-coin-flip?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4236935.jpeg

42388622,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQ07X,1668457836,FTX Hack or Inside Job? Blockchain Experts Examine Clues and a ‘Stupid Mistake’,"The beleaguered crypto exchange FTX suffered a $400 million hack over the weekend, and at least one blockchain expert says the clues are point to a high-level insider who committed an amateur misstep that might have inadvertently revealed their identity.  The attacker appears to have “had access to all the cold wallet storages which he exploited,” Dyma Budorin, co-founder and chief executive of blockchain security auditing firm Hacken, said Monday in an interview with CoinDesk TV.  Hacken investigated blockchain transactions and found that the looter tried to send tether (USDT) stablecoin on the Tron blockchain multiple times unsuccessfully because they didn’t have enough TRX, the Tron network’s native token, in the wallet to pay for transaction fees. So the looter used their verified personal account on crypto exchange Kraken to send 500 TRX to the compromised wallet address to cover the transaction.  “He made a stupid mistake,” Budorin said.  Because of Kraken’s “know-your-customer” or KYC measures – part of the anti-money-laundering compliance requirements – and verification process, the exchange had information on who owns the personal wallet the TRX was sent from, revealing the identity behind the exploit.  Hacken immediately contacted Kraken’s security team about the transaction, Budorin said.  “We know the identity of the user,” Nick Percoco, chief security officer of crypto exchange Kraken, said in a tweet Saturday. Percoco added he was told that FTX or the exchange’s founder and former chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, will release an official statement.  Budorin said that the exploit demonstrated that the way FTX managed its cold wallets was “very poor.”  FTX suffered a hack late Friday night, resulting in more than $600 million in digital assets leaving the exchange's wallets in a flurry of withdrawals. FTX's new CEO, John Ray acknowledged that the exchange had been ""compromised,"" and said that it was taking “precautionary steps…to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions.” Hacken found that one entity, which Budovin suspects to be an insider, siphoned about $400 million from the exchange.  Read more: 'FTX Has Been Hacked': Crypto Disaster Worsens as Exchange Sees Mysterious Outflows Exceeding $600M  New details about the exploit led to speculation on crypto Twitter that possibly FTX owner Sam Bankman-Fried or someone in his close circle could have been behind the exploit, given the access to FTX's cold wallets.  Asked whether Bankman-Fried was the owner of the compromised wallet the exploit originated from, Budorin said that “this is confidential information,” but he added that the wallet’s owner is a U.S. citizen. Budorin did not return CoinDesk’s request for additional comment at publication time on how he obtained information about the hacker’s citizenship and whether Kraken shared any personal data with Hacken of the account’s holder.  A Kraken spokesperson said that the exchange is “in contact with law enforcement, and has frozen Kraken account access to certain funds we suspect to be associated with ‘fraud, negligence or misconduct’ related to FTX,” according to a statement sent in email.  Of course, blockchain-savvy criminals can be sophisticated, so it’s possible that the mistake was a red herring the looter intentionally provided to mislead the investigation – by stirring some confusion.  “It’s very common for a scammer to use a fake KYC (know-your-customer) account so that authorities go chasing the wrong person,” Cryptogle, a blockchain sleuth, told CoinDesk.  Top exchange FTX and its corporate-sibling trading firm Alameda Research were the crown jewels of Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, which imploded in spectacular fashion last week after a bank run on FTX’s deposits revealed that it had lost billions of dollars of digital assets that belonged to customers.  The whole conglomerate, 138 firms altogether, filed for bankruptcy protection Friday after rescue plans failed, triggering several investigations.

42417117,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6fUb,1668457659,US Crypto Tax Guide 2022,"Any U.S. citizen that dabbled in cryptocurrency will be expected to file a tax return to the IRS when tax season comes.  Cryptocurrencies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), continue to be treated as “property” for the purposes of tax in the United States. This was originally decided by the IRS in a notice published in 2014 and means that a majority of taxable actions involving digital assets will incur capital gains tax treatment, similar to how stocks are taxed. Cryptocurrencies received from select activities, however, are treated as income and therefore subject to income tax treatment.  This guidance around taxable events has become murky, largely due to new activities related to decentralized finance (DeFi).  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  When do U.S. citizens have to pay tax on crypto?  Capital gains tax events involving cryptocurrencies include:  Selling cryptocurrency for fiat (U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, etc.).  Sending cryptocurrency as a gift (anything over $15,000 for the 2021 tax year).  Purchasing goods and services with cryptocurrency, even small purchases like buying a coffee.  Trading or swapping one digital asset for another. This includes purchasing NFTs using cryptocurrencies.  It’s worth noting you only owe tax on any capital gains you make from these events, not the full amount of disposed assets. This is calculated as the difference between the price paid for the asset and the price it was sold at.  The IRS has also not yet provided clarity on whether minting tokens – including creating wrapped tokens, publicly minting NFTs or minting interest-bearing assets – creates a taxable event or not. Nor is it clear at this stage whether depositing of withdrawing liquidity from DeFi liquidity pools using liquidity provider (LP) tokens is considered a crypto-crypto transaction. Professional guidance should be sought if you’ve dealt with any of these assets or processes over the last tax year.  Income tax events include:  Receiving cryptocurrency from an airdrop.  Any crypto interest earnings from DeFi lending.  Crypto mining income from block rewards and transaction fees.  Crypto earned from liquidity pools and interest-bearing accounts.  Receiving cryptocurrency as a means of payment for carrying out work, including bug bounties.  The tax laws surrounding crypto earned via staking remain the most complicated. Generally, the act of depositing your coins into a staking pool is not a taxable event, but the staking rewards you receive may be taxable. The IRS has not formally issued specific guidance on this staking rewards, so it is best to consult with a tax professional well-heeled in crypto taxes if you earn crypto through staking.  Losses incurred from trading can be used to offset your capital gains as well as deduct up to $3,000 off your normal income tax depending on how long you’ve held the assets for (see below). Any additional losses can be carried forward to the next tax year. You do, however, have to show a loss across all assets in a particular class to qualify for a capital gains reduction.  How much U.S. crypto tax do you pay?  Calculating how much cryptocurrency tax you owe in the U.S. is based on how long you’ve held the assets prior to disposing of them, as well as which income tax bracket you fall under.  This is divided into two parts:  Short-term capital gains: Profits from a crypto asset held less than a year are taxed at the same rate as whichever income tax bracket you’re in. Any losses can be used to offset income tax by a maximum of $3,000. Any further losses can be carried forward.  Long-term capital gains: For crypto assets held for longer than one year, the capital gains tax is much lower; 0%, 15% or 20% tax depending on individual or combined marital income.  How to prepare for U.S. crypto tax season  Preparing and filing your crypto taxes can be an arduous process, particularly if you’ve never done it before. The first step is the most important and the most time-consuming part of the filing process – collating all of your crypto activity.  For some, this might only involve logging one or two trades. But for more experienced investors who have dabbled in NFTs, yield farming, airdrops and other types of crypto trading, it can be a monumental task. That’s why it’s usually advisable to keep track of your trades as you go along throughout the tax year to prevent having to do it all in one go.  Once you’ve completed the first step, you’ll then need to calculate any capital gains and losses. There are a number of platforms that can take care of this for you, some of which offer free trials and may provide all you need to complete this next step.  From there, you’ll need to fill in Form 8949 and add it to Form Schedule D. Any crypto assets earned as income need to be added to Schedule 1 Form 1040, and self-employed earnings from crypto need to be added to Schedule C.  Finally, submit your forms and pay whatever amount of tax you owe before the deadline.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Ollie Leech,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/us-crypto-tax-guide-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb17ac58db9f0e7ccea3276afcb3324be2160d84-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420786,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYGyb,1668455769,FTX’s Failure Is Sparking a Massive Regulatory Response,"A hammer is going to fall on crypto exchange FTX. The question is how heavy it might be.  The collapse of FTX will likely give rise to a number of criminal and civil actions against the exchange and its executives, like former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. It’s also likely to push forward actual regulatory changes, either via lawmakers or through federal agencies themselves, a number of individuals told CoinDesk.  FTX filed for bankruptcy last Friday, days after halting withdrawals and a little over a week after CoinDesk first reported that the balance sheet of FTX sister company Alameda Research held a surprisingly large amount of FTT, an exchange token issued by FTX. FTX was “fine,” Bankman-Fried said in response to questions about his exchange’s solvency, before a series of events showed otherwise.  As a result, several state and federal agencies launched or expanded investigations into the company, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities Commission of the Bahamas and the Bahamas’ Financial Crimes Investigation Branch.  Members of the U.S. Congress from both political parties are also calling for further action as a result of the collapse. Some lawmakers are even talking about holding hearings, potentially by the end of the year, said Ron Hammond of the Blockchain Association.  Read more: 8 Days in November: What Led to FTX’s Sudden Collapse  Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that the collapse is “a dramatic demonstration of both the inherent risks of digital assets and the critical weaknesses in the industry that has grown up around them.”  Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are among those in Congress calling for investigations into the collapse as well as Sam Bankman-Fried, who was a major party donor.  Other lawmakers, like Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the current ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the outgoing ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, said it was regulatory ambiguity in the U.S. that allowed FTX to grow as large as it had as an offshore exchange. They called for Congress or regulatory agencies to provide clearer guidelines for crypto exchanges to operate.  The fact that regulators apparently had no view into some of the major projects that fell apart this year – such as Celsius, Three Arrows, Luna and now FTX – is “precisely the problem,” said an industry participant who works closely with policymakers.  Still, the individual told CoinDesk that they don’t expect any major legislative action to occur this year. Most likely, Congress will look at bills like the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, a bill that Bankman-Fried supported but was written prior to that, in the upcoming year.  Investigations  According to an attorney who requested anonymity, the SEC may have an easier time kicking off the investigation just due to its mandate.  “The SEC is in a much better position to go to court and get a freeze [on assets] if they believe there's a reason to do that,” the attorney said. “The SEC also has a less cumbersome process for subpoenaing testimony and freezing documents.”  The SEC and DOJ are likely to cooperate though, to the extent that DOJ investigators may sit in on SEC interviews.  Read more: 'FTX Has Been Hacked': Crypto Disaster Worsens as Exchange Sees Mysterious Outflows Exceeding $600M  The fact that FTX is registered and headquartered in the Bahamas is not likely to impact these investigations, the attorney said. FTX has various U.S. connections, which is all the SEC and DOJ need to assert jurisdiction for their investigations.  FTX appears to be preparing for these investigations, with FTX US General Counsel Ryne Miller having already told the entire company to preserve documents.  A former federal prosecutor told CoinDesk that the bankruptcy court may also shed light on the situation, thus assisting government investigators with their probes.  ""The bankruptcy court has the ability to now oversee the company and to obtain information from the company that, let's say the DOJ might not have been able to obtain as easily pre-bankruptcy, and they'll likely have access to a new trustee or an examiner and be able to learn in essentially real-time what's going on,” the former prosecutor said.  Executives like Bankman-Fried may also “be in a tough spot with respect to” deciding whether to cooperate or assert Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, the former prosecutor added.  Tweeting exhibits  A complicating factor – for FTX anyway – may be the fact that Bankman-Fried has tweeted his way through his company’s collapse.  On Nov. 7, a few days after CoinDesk first reported on Alameda’s balance sheet, the one-time crypto wunderkind tweeted that “FTX has enough to cover all client holdings.” He went so far as to say that speculation about his company’s solvency was a rumor spurred by a competitor (Binance) but that “assets are fine.”  Later in the week, he tweeted that FTX US was also fine and fully liquid. Only hours later, FTX US warned users it might suspend withdrawals.  Within a day, Bankman-Fried agreed to a buyout/bailout of his reeling exchange by rival Binance (Binance walked away from the deal less than 24 hours later, precipitating the bankruptcy filing, including for FTX US). The tweets were deleted.  “It’s a complete nightmare,” said Ken White, a former federal prosecutor and a partner at the Brown White & Osborn law firm. “This is a situation where all sorts of agencies are going to be looking at this, the SEC, the FTC, and probably the Department of Justice. There are all sorts of potential criminal and civil consequences – lawsuits. Civil lawsuits are a certainty. And here he is sort of tweeting out his thoughts about it. It's every attorney’s nightmare of what a client might do.”  Read more: Washington, D.C.’s Buddy Sam Bankman-Fried Has Some Explaining to Do  Other attorneys agree, including John Sparacino, a principal at McKool Smith, who suspected Bankman-Fried did not run his tweets through a lawyer.  The former FTX CEO’s conduct is “going to be under a microscope,” said Sparacino, and it seems likely that some of Bankman-Fried’s tweets may come back to haunt him as litigation works its way through the courts.  Sparacino said he did not know if there were any regulatory or criminal aspects to the tweets, but would still expect them to show up in litigation.  The fact that Bankman-Fried repeatedly took to Twitter to reassure his exchange’s users that everything was fine before the various stages of its fall could make any case against him easier, said White, calling the tweets “extraordinarily foolish.”  “It creates new bases for criminal or civil claims against him just based on those tweets,” White said. “So if he says that everything's fine, that their assets are real assets, and that's not true, then that can be securities fraud, and wire fraud, all sorts of other stuff, not to mention all sorts of civil causes of action … It is just disastrously reckless.”  Investigators may look at what Bankman-Fried’s tweets would indicate to individual investors, as well as what FTX’s representations were. And while it is entirely possible that Bankman-Fried may have believed that his exchange was safe and stable before being proven wrong by unanticipated events, it is also possible that he tweeted inaccurate information. The exchange’s ties to Alameda will also raise scrutiny – if Bankman-Fried was transferring user funds into Alameda and losing those investments, that may become a liability during litigation.  Asked what advice he’d give Bankman-Fried, White said, “My advice is shut the f*** up or I quit.”  “Even if the money is good, sometimes you just don't as a lawyer,” he said. “You don't want to be attached to someone who's deciding to self-immolate.”",NEGATIVE,FTT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB | FTT,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/14/ftxs-failure-is-sparking-a-massive-regulatory-response,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa65edf5f5369dafa55e8f9335c4fd17c8855731-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414921,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBUqOb,1668455279,"Solana Foundation Invested in FTX, Held Millions in Sam Bankman-Fried-Linked Cryptos on Exchange","The Solana Foundation said Monday it has tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies stranded on FTX – as well as 3.24 million common stock shares in Sam Bankman-Fried’s bankrupt crypto exchange.  In a blog post, the Foundation said it held 134.54 million SRM tokens and 3.43 million FTT tokens on FTX when withdrawals went dark on Nov. 6. Those assets are worth $29.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, at current market prices per CoinGecko; they were worth around $107 million and $83 million one day before the freeze.  Those holdings point to deep financial ties between Solana and FTX, which created the FTT token and held court over Serum, an on-chain crypto exchange that Bankman-Fried created and which was at the center of much of Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi).  See also: FTX Hack Sparks Revolution at Serum DEX as Solana Devs Plot Alameda's Ouster  FTX’s collapse last week continues to reverberate through Solana, perhaps most acutely through its severe sell pressure on the price of SOL, which is down 57% in a week. But FTX’s role in managing infrastructure critical to Solana DeFi has caused a crisis for individual protocols, too.  Many trading projects on Solana used wrapped assets called “Sollet assets” as stand-ins for bitcoin, ether and other non-native cryptocurrencies. FTX was believed to be the issuer and backer of these assets; its collapse has sent them into a spiral and shouldered a handful of protocols with bad debt.  “The total exposure to Sollet-based assets on Solana in circulation is valued at approximately $40 million as of Nov 10, 2022. The status of the underlying assets is unknown at this time,” the blog post said.  The Solana Foundation itself appears to have avoided the worst of the crisis. It held less than $1 million of its balance sheet on FTX when withdrawals ceased. “The impact on Solana Foundation operations is negligible,” the blog post said. It lost no SOL to FTX.

This created a hole in its balance sheet that ultimately led to its collapse last week.  FTX’s former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was a key backer of Solana, a smart contracts platform whose native SOL token powers trades across various decentralized finance protocols – much like Ethereum and its “gas” token ETH.  Bankman-Fried’s exchange and trading firm had purchased a total of 58,086,686 SOL tokens from the Foundation and sister entity Solana Labs from August 2020 onwards, the blog post said.

42411314,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzXS,1668454416,After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto’s Founding Mission,"After one of the most dramatic weeks in crypto history, in which a large and highly regarded trading platform was revealed to be engaging in shady financial management resulting in a multibillion-dollar balance sheet hole and the bankruptcy of more than 130 related companies, we’re left wondering how this could happen in an industry created to obviate the need for trust.  That question is naïve, however – while details are starting to emerge around how much money was moved where and why, the underlying reason is this: We chose to trust.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  The instinctive reaction, then, familiar to all who have had trust broken, will be to vow to never be that vulnerable again. In finance, we do now have the technology to facilitate a relatively trust-free financial relationship with atomic swaps, transfer monitoring and balance verification. But, just as our bruised souls almost always eventually recover from personal disappointment and we again open our hearts to others, we will see that we can’t live without centralized services that require us to believe they are doing what they say.  This is a consequence of internal and external systems that we can’t do much about.  The internal system is our emotional makeup. We humans are wired to rely on others for survival. It’s why our ancestors formed tribes, clans and countries. Modern times have given us the means to feed ourselves and shelter without help, and yet most of us still seek out friendship and a sense of belonging because satisfying emotional needs alone is not yet something we are good at. The parallel in commerce and finance is the energy-saving convenience of having specialists handle as much as possible, creating satisfying connections while freeing up our time for other pursuits.  Read more: CoinDesk's continuing coverage of FTX's collapse  The external system is the regulatory framework many of us live in. When it comes to financial services, our choices are limited to those offered by counterparties that have satisfied certain requirements designed to ensure that we are making informed decisions and that our assets will be recoverable. Hardly anyone reads the small print of the terms and conditions we need to accept before we can transact – it’s a better use of our time to assume that they make sense. We also don’t demand proof that the firm follows sound practices – we assume that it would rather avoid the punishment of non-compliance with the law.  But crypto was created to be different. Perhaps too much so for us to emotionally adapt in such a short time frame.  Trusting FTX  We didn’t have to trust FTX – there are decentralized alternatives, after all. But we chose to. We could have insisted on more clarity on the balance sheet, done some forensics on token movements earlier and asked why no investors were on the board of directors. But we didn’t.  We fell into the ingrained habit of trusting a centralized provider, for many reasons: the convenience, the potential for return, the sense of belonging and instinctive respect for smarts and eloquence, as well as the uplifting satisfaction of rooting for the scruffy underdog and seeing him (Sam Bankman-Fried) succeed.  This is perhaps the result of drawing inferences from patterns – if a company is big and successful, it must be legit, right? If it has so many offices in so many jurisdictions, if it is supporting the growth of the industry in so many areas, if the founder has so many famous and powerful friends, then surely the verification work has been done, right?  Throw in a hefty dose of ideology, and you get a supportive crowd whose strong desire for the concept to triumph suppressed the normal checks on common sense. And there’s the affective reflex that drew in even non-believers: Who doesn’t love a nerdy outsider who quietly and intelligently explains how he’s going to make the world a better place by reforming finance and giving away most of his money?  I’m not pointing any fingers here, except perhaps at the mirror.  Where do we go from here?  Do we eschew centralized platforms forever because we can’t be trusted to vet them properly? That sounds appealing right now, and the resilience and growth of decentralized applications paint a landscape of empowering potential. But we know that many of us will slip back into the habit of instinctively choosing convenience over safety, convinced that we will be better at spotting danger signs next time. After all, convenience breeds efficiency, which generates economic gain, and as humans, we instinctively gravitate toward comfort and collaboration.  We can do better. We can accept that centralized platforms will form an integral part of our markets, while learning from this debacle and designing tools that make trust less based on blind faith. This is already happening – over the past week, several platforms have announced that they will publish “proof of reserves,” a combination of cryptographic and traditional audit that enables users to independently verify that a platform’s assets match or exceed customer deposits.  In the future, venture-capital investors, some of whom will have a bit of uncomfortable explaining to do over the coming weeks, will become more rigorous in their due diligence, at least until the next hot fad comes along.  Lobby groups and policy teams will work with regulators to draft disclosure rules while fending off hasty limitations and destructive definitions. Institutions will step back from the edge of radical innovation, but are likely to continue to support an emerging structure that looks familiar but can deliver better returns.  And the industry will continue to build a stronger offering that showcases a fundamental tenet of its existence: greater choice for individuals, anywhere. Those who want to use decentralized services should be able to do so. Those who prefer the convenience of a centralized offering deserve reliable services.  Read more: Nic Carter – Let’s Actually Commit to Proofs of Reserve This Time, Okay?  This may read like wishful thinking. But I trust human nature to do what it does best – find a collective solution to the generalized demand for protection while supporting niche solutions for outlier groups. After all, throughout history these non-mainstream idealists have been the innovators who succeed in pushing through reform when their ideas end up delivering better efficiency and empowerment than the existing system.  We will trust again. As we should – it’s part of who we are and a necessary feature of communities that build value. We have to understand the concept better, though. An awareness of why we trust is an essential part of designing systems to deliver what we need while mitigating vulnerabilities fed by our short-sightedness.  The FTX debacle has left pain and anger in its wake. It’s in our hands to make sure nothing like this happens in our industry again, while at the same time understanding how we got here. It’s also up to us to pick ourselves up, support those who are struggling and continue moving forward.  Part of the process will involve accepting that centralization will be a necessary, but carefully crafted, feature of the decentralized system we hope for. Part will be believing that, with the help of technology and much better messaging, we can achieve our goals without changing the nature of the people that make this industry the diverse force that it is.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/14/after-ftx-rebuilding-trust-in-cryptos-founding-mission,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e7d0f4fb4eddbc25608dc772ef07319c120d7e2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390170,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bWOYx9,1668453436,Crypto Capital Gains and Tax Rates 2022,"According to an IRS notice published in 2014, cryptocurrencies including NFTs are classified as “property” meaning they are liable to a capital gains tax similar to stocks or “real” property.  A capital gain occurs if you sell a crypto for more than your initial investment. For instance, if you buy one bitcoin for $20,000 and sell it for $50,000, you have made $30,000 of taxable gains. In other words, if you make profit from the sale of a crypto or a non-fungible token (NFT), you trigger a taxable event in the eyes of the IRS.  This piece is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week.  Sounds simple right? But before you jump the gun and consider yourself a professional crypto tax accountant, here are some things you should know about capital gains taxes to avoid any deadline day stress.  How are crypto taxes on capital gains determined?  The length of time that you hold your crypto will affect the amount of capital gains you will be liable to pay.  If you hold cryptocurrencies for 12 months or less, short-term capital gains tax will apply.  If you hold crypto for more than 12 months you will be subject to long-term capital gains tax treatment.  According to the IRS, your holding period begins the day after you purchase a crypto. So, it’s important to know when you received your crypto asset and what tax rates and rules apply when you sell or trade it.  Short-term capital gains  For 2022, the federal short-term capital gains rate is the same as your ordinary income tax rate, where your tax rate is dependent on your total income, ranging from 10% to 37%.  For instance, let’s say you earn a salary of $80,000 and made $10,000 in short-term crypto investments; your taxable income sits at a combined amount of $90,000. That will all be taxed as income.  Long-term capital gains  If you hold crypto for a period longer than 12 months and then opt to sell or trade that crypto, you will be subject to a long-term capital gains tax treatment. Long-term capital gains tax rates have different rates than the short-term capital gains, ranging from 0% to 20% depending on your total income. This is much lower than the short-term capital gains brackets and encourages investors to make longer-term investments. Most filers will not pay more than the 15% rate. The 20% rate for 2022 applies only to capital gains over $459,750 for single filers and $517,200 for married couples filing jointly, for example.  Let’s look at a theoretical example of how long-term capital gains can save money compared to short-term capital gains. The chart below shows a married couple with $100,000 earnings jointly filing their capital gains for selling 10 ETH at different times (price of ETH is not based on current price in the example).  The couple could save $70 by holding on to their assets for more than 12 months. This may not seem like a lot in this example, but imagine if they were selling 1,000 ETH – that would still be taxed at the 15% rate for long-term capital gains and result in $7,000 saved in taxes.  Taxable events  Having looked at the two types of capital gains you may face and the importance of understanding timing when disposing of crypto, let’s look at what events can trigger a capital gain tax. Again, these prices are theoretical and not based in current market prices.  Selling crypto: The most common capital gain trigger event occurs when you sell your crypto for fiat currency. For instance, if you buy 2 ETH for $1,000 and you sell them for $2,000 six months later, you will report a short-term capital gain of $1,000 and be taxed on that amount. The same applies for a long-term capital gain if you hold your ETH for more than 12 months.  Using your crypto to purchase goods and services: If you use crypto to purchase a good or a service, you will be subject to a capital gain tax. Let’s say you bought one bitcoin for $100 in 2013 and have not touched it since. Now the bitcoin is worth $60,000 and you decide to sell that bitcoin and purchase a new car for $60,000. As a result, you incur a long-term capital gain of $59,900 – the difference between the cost of the car and the value of your bitcoin when you sold it.  Trading one crypto for another crypto: Trading cryptos is considered a taxable event, regardless of if they are traded directly one-to-one on Uniswap or on an exchange. Let’s say you purchased 10 AAVE for $200 each for a total of $2,000. Later, you traded all your AAVE for ETH. At the time of the trade, AAVE's price is $500, bringing your total AAVE holdings to $5,000. Here you incurred a capital gain of $3,000 that you'll have to report – the difference between the value of your 10 AAVE when purchased and the value of your entire AAVE holdings at the time of trade. This also applies when you use an NFT to purchase crypto.  Special cases  Crypto donations: The IRS considers crypto donations the same as cash donations, making them tax deductible. The existing limits for deductions range from 20% to 60% of adjusted gross income. However, if you sell your crypto and then donate the after-tax cash to a charity, the capital gain could be short-term or long-term depending on the holding period. For more information on donations see here.  Crypto gifts: If you make a crypto gift to someone, make sure it’s below $15,000 since no gift tax would apply. If you go over, you'll have to file Form 709 and will owe taxes on the gift. However, if you receive crypto as a gift and decide to sell the crypto, then your cost basis will be the same as that of the gift donor and you will have to pay capital gains.  Inherited crypto assets: Inherited cryptos are liable to the same estate regulations as any other asset class.  Calculating your capital gains  Since 2019, the guidelines on how to calculate crypto-related capital gains has become clearer. In practice there are three ways that you could calculate your capital gains and they can make a big difference on the amount you are taxed.  1. FIFO: First-in-first-out (FIFO) calculates your tax from the time you purchased your crypto to the time you sell it. Using the FIFO method means capital gains will be based on the price of the first of the five bitcoin purchased on March 19, 2017, for $500 each for a total of $2,500, for example. The buyer later sells them for $2,000 each for a total of $10,000 in the same 12 months.  Selling price – purchasing price (first bought bitcoin) = taxable gain  (5 x $2,000) – (5 x $500) = $7,500  2. LIFO: Last-in-first-out (LIFO) calculates your taxes by the last unit purchased and considers it as the first unit eligible for sale. If you bought two bitcoins on March 19, 2017, for $500 and three bitcoins on Feb. 6, 2016, for $400, the calculation will look like this:  Selling price – purchase price (last bought bitcoin) – purchase price (first bought bitcoin) = taxable gain  (5 x $2,000) – (2 x $500) – (3 x $400) = $7,800  3. HIFO: Highest-in-first-out (HIFO) calculates your taxes by taking the coin with the highest purchase price as the one sold first. If the highest price paid for the five bitcoins you were selling was $500 and you purchased three bitcoins at that price and then two more bitcoins at $400, the calculation would look like this, regardless of when you bought those bitcoins:  Selling price – (highest priced bitcoin) - (next highest priced bitcoin) = taxable gain  (5 x $2,000) – (3 x $500) - (2 x $400) = $7,700  With that all said and done, it is important to make sure you keep your crypto transactions in check and record them before taxes are due. This can become even more complex once airdrops, liquidity pools, staking and other crypto products come into play. That’s why it is a good idea to record your trades and potentially seek advice from crypto tax tool experts such as:  Accointing  CoinTracker  CoinLedger  Taxbit  TokenTax  ZenLedger  By understanding your capital gains and knowing how you might best reduce your tax liability, you will escape the hot seat on tax deadline day!",NEUTRAL,AAVE | ETH,AAVE | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Stephan  Roth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/crypto-capital-gains-and-tax-rates-2022,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3656eb3613f276c120f15e22864a259b90ce813b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Both 2017 And 2021 Bitcoin Cycles Saw New Lows Around The 365-Day Mark Since The Top As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the two cycles are more similar than one might expect them to be. The indicator of relevance here is the “drawdown from ATH,” which measures the percentage decrease in the price of Bitcoin following the all-time high during each cycle. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric for the 2017 and 2021 cycles: Looks like the current cycle hasn't gone as deep as the previous one yet | Source: CryptoQuant In the above graph, the start point for the 2017 Bitcoin cycle drawdown is in the December of 2017, when the all-time high of the period was set. Following this top, the price of the crypto took a sharp plunge until around when the drawdown from the ATH had reached a value between 65-70%. Related Reading: Smooth Love Potion Price Predicted to Near Zero by 2023 – New Gaming Crypto Coins Better Investment After reaching these drawdown values, the price started to stabilize, and ran sideways for about 110 days. Then, however, in the November of 2018 the value of Bitcoin suddenly collapsed, and kept declining until the bottom was reached around 365 days following the ATH. As for the current 2021 cycle, the top formed last November, and since then the price has been dropping off. The chart shows the path this drawdown has taken so far. While the decline isn’t exactly the same in the two cycles, there is still a striking similarity between them. Just like in the previous cycle, Bitcoin plunged hard following the top, until the drawdown from the ATH hit a value of 70%. The crypto’s price then consolidated flat similar to in the previous cycle, and then at around the 365-day mark, BTC made a new low after plunging in a similar fashion to the November 2018 crash.

So far this cycle has resembled the previous one, but it’s uncertain at the moment whether it will continue to do so in the rest of the bear or not.

The agency will look into people, institutions, banks and crypto service providers related to FTX, the notice said. This may include local subsidiary FTX Turkey, which is listed among 134 entities tied to Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.com that are now seeking protection from bankruptcy in the U.S.  With the investigation, Turkey – a fast-growing crypto market – is joining jurisdictions such as the U.S. and the Bahamas (where the global business had its headquarters), in probing Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto enterprise. News of investigations comes after a tumultuous week filled with a failed acquisition deal, rumors, a voluntary petition for insolvency and a $600 million hack of the embattled exchange.  Meanwhile, FTX Turkey has been working to process customer withdrawals within certain limits. The subsidiary told CoinDesk Turkey that its goal is to get all customer funds returned.  ""Even during the technical difficulties caused by FTX.com, the FTX TR [Turkey] team worked hard not to victimize the users by giving their best and continues to work. Sharing transparent information about the process from its social media accounts, we manage this process professionally and in a way that does not harm its users,” FTX Turkey said.  CoinDesk reported last week that many of the 134 entities listed in the FTX bankruptcy petition learned of the filing at the same time as the public did. One source told CoinDesk at the time that FTX Turkey was hit particularly hard, with staff in Turkey having put their paychecks and bonuses into the company because of a distrust of local banks and inflation of the lira.

The exchange, which was strapped for cash, was trying to patch the hole on its balance sheet, according to O’Leary, who is a paid spokesman for the beleaguered exchange, a corporate account holder and also a shareholder.  The “Shark Tank” star told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Monday that he spoke with the now former CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, Thursday, a day before the Bahamas-based exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  Days before, O’Leary said, he was looking to make sense of the liquidity issue on FTX's balance sheet. At the time, O’Leary said that he was receiving an influx of “inbound requests” from sovereign wealth and pension funds interested in helping fix FTX’s cash crunch. Bankman-Fried told O’Leary that FTX was looking for $8 billion.  Read more: Bankrupt FTX Faces Criminal Investigation in the Bahamas  “That’s the kind of money that an institution or a sovereign wealth fund can put to work if they thought there was an interesting opportunity,” O’Leary said. “In financial services, liquidity events like this can be interesting investment opportunities if you think it's a legitimate investment and it's not an issue with the regulator.”  But by then, Gensler said the crypto industry was “significantly non-compliant” and in need of more regulation.  “The minute that occurred, that was the end of any sovereign wealth fund’s interest,” O’Leary said. “There was no way to get that $8 billion onto the balance sheet of FTX with the regulators hovering overhead.”  O’Leary speculated that for FTX to remain solvent, the exchange would have needed between $3.5 billion to $4 billion.  Still sees life for crypto  The collapse of crypto exchange FTX doesn't mean it will be the end for crypto, O’Leary said.  He told CoinDesk TV the fall of FTX is a “defining” moment that will “stabilize” the industry.  “This does not kill crypto,” O’Leary said. “There’s going to be a silver lining to this disaster. There’s no question about it. It’ll be called regulation.”  Read more: 8 Days in November: What Led to FTX’s Sudden Collapse  O’Leary, also a shareholder of FTX International and FTX.US, said the exchange’s collapse is “going to accelerate regulation,” but added that before that can happen, lingering “collateral damage” will need to be weeded out.  “This is a bottoming process and an event like this is very important because it’s going to finally have several impacts that we need,” O’Leary said. “What we don’t know is how many other dominoes are going to fall yet.

The inflows coincided with the crypto market's sharp downturn, triggered by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s business empire last week, including the FTX exchange and his Alameda Research trading firm.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has fallen over 20% in the past seven days and was trading at about $16,400 Monday. The CoinDesk Market Index was up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.  Despite the market downturn, the inflows could indicate that investors see “this price weakness as an opportunity” and are “differentiating between ‘trusted’ third parties and an inherently trustless system,” according to CoinShares.  A key footnote to the data is that so-called short-bitcoin investment products – those betting on a price decline – saw $12.6 million in inflows.  “While sentiment is predominantly positive, it has spooked some investors,” the report said.  Switzerland the outlier  Investment products designed to bet on bitcoin gains saw $19 million in inflows last week, the largest since early August.  Regionally, most inflows came from the U.S., at $29 million, followed by Brazil and Canada with $8 million and $4.3 million in inflows, respectively. Switzerland was the outlier, seeing $4.6 million in outflows last week, the report said.  Multi-asset funds saw $8.4 million in inflows, the most since June, according to CoinShares.

The company repaid $15 million of a bitcoin-backed loan facility, possibly the one signed with NYDIG in June, cutting the outstanding value to $23 million and reducing interest costs by an annualized $2 million. It also renegotiated the collateral requirement to free up $5 million of bitcoin and extended the maturity until Dec. 29, the company said in a statement Monday. The miner paid down $12 million of equipment-backed term debt.  Miners have suffered as the declining value of bitcoin has narrowed profit margins, making cash flow and debt obligations the key determinants of their survival. Major firms like Core Scientific (CORZ) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) have said they are in liquidity crunches, with Core halting payments related to financings in late October and early November. One of the biggest hosting firms, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy in September.  Bitfarms said it has raised $15 million through an at-the-market equity program since the start of the third quarter, and expects another $3.5 million of cash by year-end from the sale of a bitcoin mining site.  The company lowered the cash cost of producing one bitcoin to $14,300 in the third quarter from $17,000 in the second. It reported a net loss of $85 million for the quarter, with its profit margin narrowing to 52%.  Bitfarms sold 2,595 BTC for $56 million throughout the quarter.

Like many industry experts suggested, FTX's demise has triggered increased regulatory scrutiny across the wider crypto ecosystem, which could be seen as a positive development.

Bitcoin Correlation With US Stocks May Be Weakening As BTC Has Been Moving Differently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC has gone down in the past week while stocks have made some gains. A “correlation” between two assets (or markets) exists when both their prices follow the same general trend over a period of time. For Bitcoin, there has been a strong correlation with the US stock market during the last couple of years or so.

These markets showing different behavior recently could suggest the correlation between them may be reducing. With the latest plunge, BTC has also lost the support line of the previous all-time high, something that has never happened in the previous cycles. The quant in the post notes that this recent trend is a sign of weakness in the crypto market, which could lead to further downtrend in the near future.

42411318,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzub,1668446314,The Key to Taxing Digital Assets Is Finding the Right Cubbyhole,"The path to taxation for digital assets in the U.S. is still in its infancy. As with any novel type of property, there is much to be done to appropriately designate these assets within a certain tax class.  While the taxation of cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their related transactions still has gray areas, a lot can be said for what is known – and what will surely contribute to the shaping of a tax protocol for digital assets.  Tony Tuths is digital asset practice leader and principal, alternative investment tax, at KPMG LLP. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  Identifying a tax cubbyhole  Various tax positions are being taken and therefore shown to the Internal Revenue Service on tax returns filed over the last few years, an indication the market is coming to a consensus on how certain digital assets and transactions should be categorized and taxed. Whether the IRS will agree with these “tax cubbyholes,” however, is another question entirely.  There are also industry participants who believe that digital assets should require new tax rules because of their newness, though I’d argue that every asset and transaction, no matter how new or old, has always fit within an existing cubbyhole in the U.S. tax system. The government may write special rules regarding the treatment of the new asset within the cubbyhole, but there will be an existing tax bucket for every new idea.  Defining crypto’s tax treatment  Crypto is both a fungible property that can be transferred on a blockchain and a store of value, equity or asset-backed product. In this regard, crypto resembles a financial product (think stocks or commodities). In other cases, crypto can represent governance and platform tokens, which are still property but perhaps more like generic property as opposed to financial assets.  The IRS has stated that crypto should be treated as property, but the IRS Notice from 2014 didn't specify the type of property (stock, commodity, personal or business) or segregate crypto into different property types. Assets such as NFTs only complicate the question of whether all crypto should really be treated the same for tax purposes.  Read more: Lipsa Das - The State of Crypto Taxation in India: Past, Present and Future  Taxing gains and losses  The current state of crypto taxation can be summarized this way: The sale of crypto produces a capital gain or loss (except for dealers), and what is long or short term depends on the holding period. Taxpayers can elect which crypto lots they sell for tax purposes to minimize taxes.  Certain anti-abuse rules such as the wash-sale rule and constructive-sale rule don't apply to crypto (these statutes use the terms “stocks” and “securities”), but other rules do apply. For example, the straddle rules affect “actively traded personal property.” The short-sale rules apply to crypto as well, but the embedded anti-abuse rules don't because they address only stocks and securities. These are just some of the tax nuances to be aware of.  Accounting for staking and mining  Certain crypto income transactions are unique and present special tax considerations. For example, staking (operating a node and verifying transactions in exchange for reward tokens) is treated by the market as akin to mining despite the lack of tax guidance for staking. Mining is treated as a services business and, if conducted within the U.S., it triggers U.S. tax for non-U.S. participants.  The market, however, has taken the position that delegated staking (contracting with an unrelated party to lock one’s tokens on behalf of a node owned and operated by that third party) isn't a business. With this convention, the market has formed a tax position where non-U.S. persons aren't subject to U.S. net income tax when a U.S. crypto manager engages in delegated staking on their behalf.  Of course, delegated staking rewards have their own tax issues. For non-U.S. individuals, these rewards may be subject to U.S. withholding tax if such rewards are sourced to the U.S. Different income types have different sourcing rules under the tax code.  There is no rule for staking rewards, however. The market has taken the position that staking rewards should be sourced to the location of the activity and the computer node. While it’s not clear if this is the correct course, almost all U.S.-based validators have put their staking operations outside the U.S. for this purpose.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) rewards suffer a more acute tax sourcing issue. Because locating the physical source of DeFi rewards is impossible, the market has rallied around the idea that DeFi rewards are sourced to the recipient, thereby avoiding all tax issues. DeFi presents tax issues far beyond the scope of this article, the least of which is the question of whether DeFi activities should be seen as part of a de facto partnership and taxed accordingly.  Read more: Megan DeMatteo - The NFT Creator's Guide to Year-End Tax Planning  Are all assets created equally?  With the introduction of NFTs, the digital asset tax world became infinitely more complicated. Again, taxation depends on the type of property and into which tax cubbyhole a property is placed. That said, given that NFTs can represent virtually anything from a concert ticket to artwork to a house deed, each type of property belongs in a different cubbyhole.  Applying a blanket tax doctrine to NFTs would be futile. Only the property underlying the NFT can dictate the tax treatment. Moreover, many NFTs have embedded contracts, such as licenses and royalty agreements, and should arguably be taxed independently.  In time, the U.S. will develop a more robust structure for taxing crypto, NFTs and related transactions. I suspect we will see taxation based on the substance of an asset rather than its title. Not all crypto or NFTs should or will be taxed the same. In the meantime, taxpayers have the opportunity to coalesce around certain tax positions and influence preferred treatment. And as the use of blockchain and Web3 evolves, so will the tax system – one cubbyhole at a time.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Tony Tuths,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/14/cryptocurrency-nft-digital-asset-taxation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ab91da9f3c8451f487b503505be4ff211048d3d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In his Twitter thread, Kling said that in the near term, the company would continue trading the assets it has that are not stuck in FTX, and also make a decision about what to do with its venture fund, which was not affected by FTX.  He noted that there is a lot of uncertainty about the timeline and potential recovery for FTX customers. But at some point, he said “we’ll be able to make a better call on whether Ikigai is going to keep going or just move into winddown mode.”  Regarding Ikigai’s investors, Kling wrote that he’s been in constant contact with them since Monday, and took full responsibility for the potential loss of funds. “I lost my investors’ money after they put faith in me to manage risk and I am truly sorry for that.

42411700,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJg6,1668445084,4 Things You Find in Crypto That Aren’t in Traditional Finance,"Investors accustomed to traditional financial markets can find it difficult to use familiar methods of financial analysis to evaluate cryptocurrencies. For example, a traditional investor may look at the fundamentals of a stock or security to decide if they should invest.  Sign up for CoinDesk’s Learn Crypto Investing Course.  Fundamental analysis is a method of determining the value of a security in order to understand if it’s a good buy compared to current market prices. Investors will look at certain factors like price-to-earnings (PE), price-to-book (PB), earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow (FCF), among many others, in order to arrive at a conclusion.  Read More: 3 Indicators Beginner Crypto Traders Should Use, According to Pros  But you can’t listen to a quarterly earnings call for a token because they don’t exist. There’s no company revenue, profit or expenses to look at for, say, bitcoin (BTC) – there’s no Bitcoin “company” running the show – the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is an essential, founding part of the project.  So what can analysts and investors use instead to make decisions? And what else do they have to keep in mind?  Tokenomics  Tokenomics is a popular and important way to analyze a cryptocurrency project. Tokenomics is the system of incentives and mathematics that govern a crypto project. A token with a sound plan for why people will buy and hold tokens over time has a good chance to succeed, while a project with poor tokenomics is doomed to fail. Understanding the tokenomics of a project is vital in order to make a wise decision.  Token distribution is a large part of tokenomics – this means understanding who holds the tokens and how they were given out. Another thing to consider is if the supply is limited or unlimited, and how new tokens enter the ecosystem. For instance, Bitcoin limits the supply at 21 million coins; new coins enter the ecosystem through proof-of-work, while Cardano (ADA) is a proof-of-stake blockchain with a maximum supply of 45 billion.  Other things to consider include:  Are tokens burned or removed from the blockchain?  Is it an inflationary or deflationary token?  Taking these things into consideration can give investors signals of the long-term viability and expected growth of a cryptocurrency. For example, if a token is highly inflationary, that may signal to the investor that the future value of the token will be challenged.  Read More: What Is Tokenomics and Why Is It Important?  There are many other factors that go into understanding the complete tokenomics of a project. In order to find the tokenomics and other important information, analysts will usually refer to the project’s whitepaper.  White papers  In order to understand the full scope of a cryptocurrency, reading the white paper is an essential place to start.  White papers are documents specific to a crypto project. The white paper is published by the creator(s) of a coin or token before the inception of the project. The white paper is a document that outlines the project’s purpose, statistics of the project, formulas found in the project’s code and the tokenomics of the project.  By reading the white paper, investors will have a clear understanding of the goals and desires of the developers. They will understand the market the coin is competing in and the future plans of the project. They can then use this information to begin formulating an investment thesis around the project. If you can’t understand the “why” or the goal of the project after reading the white paper, that’s a bad sign. The Bitcoin white paper can be found here and clearly outlines the problem it is trying to solve and how it will accomplish that goal.  The white paper is also a place to look for red flags and check the backgrounds of the founders. A white paper filled with spelling errors, plagiarized sections, promises of returns that sound too good to be true or founders that have been linked to failed projects or rug pulls should warn investors away from the project.  Read More: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  Once an investor understands the tokenomics and has a thorough understanding of the project’s goals and intentions, they can begin to analyze the token’s blockchain.  On-Chain Analytics  One of the most interesting things you find in crypto that you don’t find in traditional finance is the availability of blockchain data that is publicly available for all to dig into – transactions and wallet balances are there for all to see “on chain,” 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  On-chain analytics is the term given to the process of using information found on a blockchain ledger to formulate an opinion on market sentiment. Analysts will look at certain metrics found on blockchain ledgers, such as wallet balances, transaction data, gas fees, transaction volume, active addresses, etc., with the goal of understanding market sentiment and whether it’s a good investment or if it's sending sell signals.  For example, if a project has many active transactions and active addresses, you may assume the coin is popular. On the other hand, if wallet balances are decreasing and transaction volume is decreasing, this would indicate that the project is losing users and might be struggling or being outcompeted by another coin. There are many resources an investor can use for on-chain analytics, such as EtherScan or Glassnode.  Read More: What Is Crypto On-Chain Analysis and How Do You Use it?  24-Hour Markets  In traditional finance, markets have operating hours. The U.S. stock market is open from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. Markets are closed on major holidays and weekends. In particularly volatile markets, investors may pay attention to after-hours trading and there are derivatives that trade outside of market hours, but nearly all of the trading volume occurs during the main daytime trading window.  On the other hand, crypto markets never shut down. Investors in the U.S. need to understand that trading in European and Asian markets will move the price of crypto assets overnight, and events in other parts of the world may cause a coin’s price to move at any time of the day. Because of this, certain macroeconomic events in foreign countries may cause price swings in crypto in domestic markets. Investors must understand the 24/7 nature of these markets and have a plan to embrace these challenges, as they are significantly different from traditional markets.  As investors learn to navigate the crypto markets and research specific coins and tokens, it is important to understand that some traditional methods of analysis don’t work in crypto, but there are other new tools to add to their analysis arsenal. It’s essential to understand the new paradigm of analysis and leverage crypto's unique attributes of openness and transparency to formulate their opinion.

Binance saw a net 81,712 bitcoin ($1.35 billion), or more than 15% of the roughly 500,000 bitcoin on its exchange, pulled from the platform over the past six days, according to data from CryptoQuant. In addition, a net 125,026 ether ($155 million) and $1.14 billion in stablecoins were withdrawn from Binance over the same period.  Appearing on a Twitter space on Monday morning, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao appealed for calm, and said a ""slight"" uptick in the pace of withdrawals is normal when the prices of cryptocurrencies drop.  The withdrawals are an industry-wide issue, with Coinglass showing nearly 200,000 bitcoin pulled from exchanges over the past seven days bringing the level of bitcoin held on exchanges down to 1.88 million. Coinbase (COIN), Gemini and Kraken are among the crypto brokers seeing percentage declines similar to Binance.  The fast exits were prompted by the implosion of FTX, which was one of the largest exchanges before it filed for bankruptcy last week. Speculation over the company's financials mounted following a CoinDesk report that identified holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, Alameda Research. Customers scrambled to quickly withdraw funds from FTX, resulting in a liquidity crunch.  Within days, FTX had seen its own bitcoin balance fall from about 20,000 to just one.  Binance made an attempt to acquire FTX at the start of last week, signing a non-binding letter of intent only to walk away from a deal 24-hours later.

That part of the company, known now as FTX US Derivatives, has not been pulled into the bankruptcy filings of FTX’s U.S. operations.  “The reason is because – I believe pretty strongly – that they are very clearly regulated by the CFTC,” Behnam said Monday at a Futures Industry Association (FIA) event in Chicago. “It's a testament to CFTC regulations and CFTC staff and the benefit of having clear, transparent rules.”  The derivatives-trading operation had been registered with the CFTC well before it was acquired by FTX. Behnam said his agency has been in direct contact with the company and its custodial operations on a daily basis rather than the usual monthly reporting “to ensure member property is where it’s supposed to be.”  “We’re pleased with where we are,” Behnam said. He added that “a lot remains to be seen over the next couple of days, weeks and months, but we’re being certainly vigilant.”  FTX US Derivatives also became the focus of heavy attention in the past year when it applied to directly clear its customers’ margin-backed, crypto derivatives trades, which then-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried personally argued for during a roundtable in which he made the case that eliminating clearing firms was a viable future path. However, the application that once represented a major crypto industry foray into the territory of traditional financial firms has now been formally withdrawn.  As for the CFTC’s enforcement powers, when Behnam was asked whether the agency would take action against FTX, he said he couldn’t comment on specific plans. However, he pointed out the CFTC does have authority over fraud and manipulation in the direct trading of crypto commodities, which would include bitcoin.  “We will use that authority to the full extent of the law,” Behnam said.  This latest crypto crisis also underlines the need for Congress to move quickly to establish regulatory controls, the chairman argued.  “We don't have the luxury of time anymore,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | REGULATION | TRADING,"Nick Baker, Jesse Hamilton",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/14/health-of-ftxs-us-derivatives-arm-owed-to-oversight-says-cftc-chief-behnam,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e63b656b39441cd498b813a5810b02ae885bad2c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411323,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glN07p,1668443943,Why Selling Some Bitcoin at a Loss Can Maximize Your Hodling Potential,"In my latest conversations with private clients, the number one question I get asked is about tax loss harvesting (TLH). TLH is best thought of as purposefully selling an investment you bought that is currently below your purchase price to lock in a capital loss on your taxes.  Due to bitcoin’s regulatory classifications, there is a unique way to take advantage of tax loss harvesting that isn't possible with equities! One quick note, the following discussion of TLH strategy is solely based on U.S. tax laws, and this practice may or may not be possible in other jurisdictions.  Steven Lubka, a CoinDesk columnist, leads Swan Private, Swan Bitcoin's concierge service for high-net worth investors. This article is part of Tax Week.  Additionally, this does not constitute advice, and make sure to talk with your own CPA [certified public accountant] before making any tax decisions!  In the stock market, if you sell an equity and repurchase a similar instrument within 30 days any loss generated from the sale will be disallowed, meaning you can't use the loss to offset any other capital gains. This rule also applies in reverse.  This is due to something called the wash sale rule, however, the wash sale rule only applies to securities. Bitcoin is classified as “property” under the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code and is exempt from the wash sale rule.  What this allows you to do is instantly sell and repurchase your bitcoin in order to lock in tax benefits. This is important because most investors don’t actually want to sell their bitcoin at these prices, they want to hold their bitcoin for its eventual recovery.  Selling bitcoin and having to wait over 30 days to buy it back could cause investors to miss out on a substantial price increase if it was done at the wrong time. This is why bitcoin’s tax classifications allow for a unique approach to managing any unrealized capital loss you may have on your bitcoin position.  See also: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  During the time I have managed the Swan Private team for Swan Bitcoin, we have helped investors perform hundreds of tax loss harvest transactions while prices have been low, generating highly meaningful tax savings.  A capital loss can benefit  So why should you lock in a capital loss? Capital losses are a versatile tax tool that can help you save a significant amount of money on your EOY [end of year] tax obligations. There are two main ways a capital loss can help you, and one important detail to be aware of.  A capital loss can be used to offset a corresponding amount of capital gains. These capital gains can include the sale of stocks, dividends from investments, the sale of real estate, the sale of rental property, the sale of startup equity and K-1 distributions. You can offset any amount of capital gains per year, up to the amount of the capital loss. The one restriction is long-term capital losses can only offset long-term capital gains, whereas short-term capital losses can offset either long term or short term capital gains.  A capital loss will allow you to offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year. Ordinary income meas W-2 income, rental property income, 1099 income and other sources.  What happens if you don’t have enough eligible capital gains and ordinary income to use your entire capital loss? You can actually roll forward the capital loss to the next year – indefinitely. This means that even if you don't expect capital gains this year, but know you will have some capital gains in a future year, you can still take advantage of any capital losses this year to mitigate future tax events.  On a basic level, all that is required is a sale and repurchase of the bitcoin position. However, there are several other considerations to keep in mind.  Choosing an accounting method  Bitcoin investors can select three different accounting treatments for their bitcoin. These are Specific ID (HIFO, or highest in, first out), last-in first-out (LIFO), and first-in first-out (FIFO). Each of these methods refers to the question of “which” bitcoin was sold when an investor sells BTC.  For example, if someone had purchased 1 BTC on two different occasions and they then sell a bitcoin - which bitcoin was it that they sold? The one they bought at $10,000 or the one they bought at $60,000. You can see this obviously makes a big difference.  FIFO: Any bitcoin sold is sold chronologically in the order in which they were purchased. The first bitcoin purchased is the first bitcoin sold. This method is generally best for people who started buying bitcoin when prices were high and kept buying as they fell.  LIFO: Any bitcoin sold is sold in reverse chronological order. This method is generally best for people who started buying when prices were low and made their last purchase when prices were high.  Specific ID (HIFO): Specifically select lots that are the highest cost and sell those first. It will usually allow the investor to lock in the largest capital loss possible regardless of when coins were purchased.  Why tax loss harvest your bitcoin?  Generally, the reason most people would take advantage of performing a TLH transaction is that they have some portion of their total bitcoin which is down more than 20%. Someone who is sitting on an unrealized capital loss of this magnitude or more, and who expects capital gains at some point in the future could benefit from taking advantage of the current low prices to lock in tax benefits for this year, or future years.  See also: Crypto Capital Gains and Tax Rates 2022 | (February)  Even if you don’t expect much in terms of capital gains anytime soon, the income deduction could also be one reason to perform a TLH transaction. This is particularly relevant for people who plan to hold their bitcoin for a long time, and potentially borrow against the bitcoin in the future instead of selling it.  If your goal is to sell your bitcoin quickly for a profit, you will end up resetting your cost basis when you do a TLH transaction which will net out any benefits accrued. However, if you have a longer investment timeline locking in losses today can be a good idea.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Steven Lubka,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/14/tax-loss-harvesting-crypto-trading-taxes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c14f17917ae189b4e55881a370689fe89ba4e2f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411325,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glN0ER,1668443797,NFT Art Museum Donations? The Pros and Cons for Your Tax Bill,"What happens when you donate a non-fungible token (NFT) to an art museum? It’s surprisingly unclear. Should museums even accept NFTs? Maybe, depending on the museum and the NFT. Many museums collect digital art, which obviously includes NFTs. And at least some NFTs are already historically significant.  Sure, it’s a little odd for a museum to collect an NFT, rather than just collecting the artwork it represents. But why not both? Museums have long collected certificates of authenticity that purport to represent “ownership” of conceptual artworks. NFTs are the same thing, in a new digital wrapper.  Brian Frye is a conceptual artist and law professor at the University of Kentucky. This article is part of Tax Week.  So, what happens when an art museum accepts a donated NFT? For the museum, not much. An NFT is just another addition to the collection. But there are some open questions. Does a museum need to own or borrow an NFT in order to show the artwork it represents? Can art museums sell NFTs? And if they can, are those sales governed by the deaccessioning rules that prohibit art museums from selling artwork for any reason other than buying artwork?  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  But for the donor, it’s a big deal. Probably the most important question is whether the donor can claim a tax deduction, and if so, for how much. Typically, when an art collector donates an artwork to an art museum, the collector can deduct the value of the donated artwork from their taxable income, lowering their federal tax bill. Why? Art museums are usually charities and donations to charities are tax deductible.  What’s a charity? A special kind of nonprofit organization that doesn’t have any owners and is dedicated to a charitable purpose. Every square is a rectangle, but not every rectangle is a square. Similarly, every charity is a nonprofit, but not every nonprofit is a charity.  Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code recognizes 28 categories of nonprofit organizations that are exempt from taxation, including fraternal organizations, cooperative telephone companies and even professional football leagues. But only organizations exempt under section 501(c)(3) are charities that can offer a charitable contribution deduction.  Charities can have many different charitable purposes. Often, their legal purpose is simply to do charitable things. But most charities actually have a more specific charitable purpose. Art museums have the charitable purpose of collecting, preserving and displaying art. Sometimes, museums buy art for their collections. But usually, they receive donations from art collectors, and the donors receive a deduction.  The charitable contribution deduction is irrelevant to most taxpayers, who take the standard deduction, rather than itemizing their deductions. But art collectors are usually wealthy, and wealthy people usually itemize, so the deduction matters a lot. For better or worse, art collectors often use donations for tax avoidance. What better way to reduce your tax liability than donating artwork that has increased in value?  But art collectors also use donations as a form of risk management. If artwork decreases in value, the owner can always donate it to a museum and take a deduction, often for more than its fair market value. Of course, the donor has to get an appraisal to substantiate the deduction.  But the art market is notoriously opaque, the value of a unique object is hard to determine, and the prior sale price is a sticky benchmark for appraisers.  Obviously, the charitable contribution deduction could be a pretty attractive option for NFT collectors, especially if they have substantial crypto-related gains or NFT-related losses. Why not donate desirable NFTs in order to offset gains or undesirable NFTs in order to mitigate losses?  Read more: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity)  Well, for one thing, many art museums are still unsure about NFTs. Sure, they’re selling NFTs. But collecting them is another story. Museums are aesthetically avant-garde, but institutionally conservative. Change is always slow, especially technological change. And there are a lot of open questions.  If museums collect NFTs, which NFTs should they collect and why? How should NFTs be accessioned and conserved? And perhaps most salient to potential donors, how should NFTs be appraised.  Still, plenty of art museums are NFT-curious. I’ve been especially impressed by the work of curator Tina Rivers Ryan of the Albright-Knox Gallery in Buffalo. And some museums have even started accepting NFT donations.  Most notably, Miami’s Institute of Contemporary Art was given the CryptoPunk #5293 NFT in July 2021. But appraisal has been a problem. While NFT collectors moan about the illiquidity of the NFT market, it’s a marvel by comparison to the conventional art market. Everyone knows the “floor price” of a collection, and desirable NFTs will sell in a millisecond, if the price is right.  See also: Why Everyone in NFTs Is Suddenly Talking About Price 'Floors' | Opinion  While the comparative liquidity of the NFT market is surely a big part of its appeal, it’s also a problem for art museums used to the stately pace of the conventional art market. Museums need to know what an artwork is worth in order to insure their collection and substantiate a deduction. But it’s hard, when the value of an artwork changes by the minute rather than the decade.  From the donor’s perspective, it’s unfortunate that price discovery is so much easier in the NFT market than in the conventional art market. It would often be convenient to claim a deduction for the purchase price of an NFT, but it would also be implausible, if everyone knows it’s worthless.  So, maybe donors should just claim the floor price at the moment of donation? That’s what you’d do with a donation of securities, but perhaps that’s an uncomfortable comparison.  Anyway, museums are sure to figure out how to accept NFT donations, sooner or later. But maybe it would be a good idea for NFT collectors to create their own museums, designed to accept NFT donations? It’ll be interesting to see how the IRS responds to charities designed for the purpose of collecting, conserving and displaying digital art.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Brian Frye,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/14/nft-taxes-art-museum-donation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef81b20e33ef05b3988eb9d14e0c26a03a8a6109-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The run on the multibillion-dollar exchange occurred over just a few days, culminating in a bankruptcy filing in the U.S. on Friday.

Binance had previously announced it would possibly acquire the ailing exchange, but less than 24 hours later backtracked on the tentative deal after it examined FTX's finances.  ""Earlier today, Paxos received direction from U.S. federal law enforcement to freeze Paxos-issued assets associated with four ethereum addresses,"" Paxos said in its statement on Saturday.  In response to the request, Paxos said it froze 11,184.38 PAXG tokens that had been on the FTX.com platform, but had since been moved to unknown wallet addresses over a 24-hour period.

42411706,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJmi,1668435440,The NFT Creator's Guide to Year-End Tax Planning,"We are officially in the final quarter of 2022 – time for year-end tax planning.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's tax week.  Many self-employed artists, following the lead of today’s top brands, may have sold their first non-fungible token (NFT) this year. For U.S.-based artists, this means the tax-filing process will be different, because crypto revenue varies from normal business cash flow.  “Creators need to be thinking about taxes – even before selling their first NFT,” said Justin Macari, a New York-based CPA and recognized Zen Ledger tax professional.  But given the rapid rise of NFTs just since late 2021, artists who recently pivoted to selling digital assets may have done so without fully considering the tax implications.  Fear not – we’ve compiled this guide with the help of seasoned tax experts to get you started. We recommend afterward that you work with a qualified tax professional who can help you hone in on the specific tax laws of your state and make the best decisions for your creative business.  Read on to learn what NFT creators should think about when planning for this coming tax season.  See Also: 5 Things to Remember When Paying Your NFT Taxes  Step 1: Determine if you are a hobby creator or a professional  The first step in claiming NFT revenue is to determine if your NFT creations count as a hobby or a full-time business activity. Many creatives experimented with NFTs this year, and anyone who profited from NFT sales should claim any earned revenue on their taxes. The Internal Revenue Service, however, taxes hobbyists differently than those who make a full-time living from their art.  Work with your accountant to complete a checklist known as the “material participation” test. This list of criteria helps business owners determine which of their income-generating activities will be taxed at the full self-employment rate, along with which aspects of their business qualify for any appropriate deductions or credits.  “The IRS considers 500 hours [to be] material participation,” Macari explained. So if by the end of 2022 you will have participated in making NFT artwork for 500 hours or more – roughly nine to 10 hours per week – prepare to claim your proceeds from NFT sales as self-employment revenue.  Self-employment tax rates are often higher than standard income tax rates because business owners must also cover the Social Security and Medicare tax payments that employers normally withhold from their employees’ paychecks. Hobbyists are usually only responsible for paying their normal income tax rate on their NFT sales, calculated as a percentage of the sum of their total adjusted taxable income from all sources (W-2 income, side hustle revenue, 1099 gigs, etc.).  “A hobbyist creator is somebody who already has a full-time job. Making money from NFTs is not their main source of income,” said Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax at crypto tax software company CoinTracker.  But while hobbyist creators typically pay less in taxes compared with full-time self-employed creators, they have the disadvantage of not being able to deduct business expenses, says Chandrasekera. Those reporting NFT income as business revenue, on the other hand, can deduct costs like software subscriptions, gadgets or even a portion of their utility bill.  Step 2: Get organized  Buying or minting an NFT can trigger a chain reaction of taxable events – and you’ll want to keep them organized. Yes, most NFT activity is already logged on blockchains, but crypto tax software can help with reporting in ways blockchain isn’t designed to do. It’s worth signing up for a portfolio tracker that can send an activity report to your accountant or to a tax platform like TurboTax.  Having a tidy log of all your NFT sales and crypto transactions serves three important tax-related purposes:  Counting accurate revenue.  Calculating cost basis.  Maximizing business deductions.  Let’s look at each of these steps in detail.  Counting accurate revenue  Macari says there’s a “huge misconception” that creators don’t have to claim crypto revenue that’s still sitting in a digital wallet. So let’s clear that up: Business owners must claim all of their revenue, whether it came in the form of crypto or fiat currency and whether they transferred it to the bank or not. Claim the value of the crypto at the time you received it, not the time you transferred it.  For instance: Quinn sold an NFT for 0.2 ether (ETH). At the time, 0.2 ETH was worth $400. Quinn waits one month to swap the ETH for USDC and another month to sell that USDC for U.S. dollars. By the time she converts her USDC for fiat, 0.2 ETH is worth $360, and after fees and market fluctuations, Quinn ends up with $340 in her bank account from that sale. Quinn, however, must claim $400 in revenue when filing her taxes, the revenue from the moment she sold it.  Calculating cost basis  The IRS classifies (at least for now) most cryptocurrency and NFTs as digital assets, the values of which are extremely volatile. Buying and selling ETH – the most popular crypto used for NFTs – or crypto of any kind requires keeping track of all the capital gains and losses that result from those transactions.  Minting an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain requires paying transaction fees, known as “gas fees.” Artists don’t always have to pay gas fees before selling their art – some platforms allow artists to transfer those costs to the buyer. However, paying gas fees affects the NFT’s cost basis, and therefore the amount of capital gains or losses the creator must pay. Cost basis is an important consideration for hobby creators who can’t claim gas fees as a deductible business expense.  Likewise, if you ever sell an NFT for a profit or loss, having a tidy sales record can help you account for the taxes you’ll owe on each sale.  Maximizing business deductions  Similarly, gas fees can also qualify as deductible business expenses for full-time creators. Artists who minted their NFTs on the blockchain prior to selling them should also have a record of all the minting fees (aka “gas fees”) they paid using cryptocurrency.  Step 3: Consider a research and development credit  Due to the experimental nature of blockchain, Macari encourages creators with boundary-pushing NFT projects to claim a tax credit for research and development under Section 174 of the tax code.  Qualifying businesses can use this credit to subtract a portion of their taxes owed, which Macari argues is even better than normal business deductions.  “A tax credit is always better than a deduction because it reduces your taxes dollar for dollar whereas deductions just reduce your taxable income,” he said.  Qualifying research expenses may include costs for hiring developers or investing in specialized tech of some kind.  “If you're building something where it's not exactly clear that this is going to become something practical, so it’s a risky investment, but you are building something creative, that's new and innovative – something that’s a subjective question in nature – that's basically the guidelines,” Macari explained.  Step 4: Find a CPA who specializes in crypto  If you’ve conducted a considerable portion of your 2022 business activity in crypto, it’s crucial you work with a tax professional who understands the nuances of the sector. Use the final months of 2022 to start researching and interviewing accountants, or ask your current accountant if he or she has the necessary skills to navigate the ever-fluctuating world of crypto.  When in doubt, visit the websites of crypto portfolio tracker companies to see if they have a list of partner tax professionals or you can upgrade your subscription to include 1-on-1 support.

42411717,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfKGT,1668435387,How to Benefit From Tax-Loss Harvesting in Crypto,"This year has been a difficult year in most major markets.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's tax week.  In 2022, as of writing, the S&P 500 is down over 20%, international stocks (as measured by the MSCI International Total Market Index) are down over 24%, the MSCI Emerging Market Index is down 27% and even U.S. government bonds are down 33%, as shown below:  Many growth stocks and large-cap U.S. stocks are down significantly more than these indexes. Some of the largest companies in the world have seen billions of dollars of market cap erased this year. Microsoft is down 34%, Amazon is down 44% and Meta (Facebook) is down a whopping 73%.  While equities and bonds have had very difficult years, cryptocurrencies have also seen significant declines. Bitcoin is down 57% and ether, the native token of Ethereum, is down 59% year to date.  While some investors see these price declines from the positive point of view that it is a buying opportunity for long-term investment strategies, others are looking for more short-term silver linings. That’s where a savvy investor may implement a tax strategy called tax-loss harvesting.  Tax-loss harvesting 101  Tax-loss harvesting is a strategy used by investors to lower the amount of tax paid to the U.S. government. To implement a tax-loss harvesting strategy, an investor deliberately sells an investment that has lost value in order to use that loss to offset either capital gains from other assets where they have turned a profit, or in order to offset future gains from either that investment or other profitable trades in the future.  An important detail to note is that tax-loss harvesting is only applicable in taxable accounts – this concept does not work for “qualified” investment accounts like an IRA or 401(k).  Let’s walk through an example of how it works.  Let’s say you have two different investments: a tech stock we’ll call “Investment A” and an energy stock we’ll label “Investment B.” Let’s assume you initially invested $10,000 into both A and B. Now let’s assume that A is down -25% and has a current value of $7,500 while B has gone up 20% and has a value of $12,000.  If you were to sell Investment B, you would have a capital gain of $2,000 and owe capital gains tax on the profit. If you were to sell Investment A, you would have a capital loss of $2,500. If you were to sell both stock A and B, you would have a net loss of $500.  So if you sell both A and B, you will offset the capital gains and avoid paying taxes on that profit while also giving you an additional $500 capital loss, which you can use to either offset other profits on sales that year, ordinary taxable income in the year during which the loss was realized. There is a limit of $3,000 per year you can claim as capital losses in this manner. If you have capital losses over $3,000 in a year, it can be carried forward to future tax years.  This strategy works great if you’re looking to sell your investments. And with traditional stock investments, there is something called the wash-sale rule that prevents you from, say, selling Investment A and then rebuying it within 30 days. If you do, it nullifies that loss. The wash-sale rule in traditional investing means you are not allowed to reinvest back into the same investment or any investment “substantially identical” within the 30-day time span from selling.  But the rule doesn’t apply to cryptocurrency.  Tax-loss harvesting in cryptocurrency  Cryptocurrency is not considered a “security” like stocks, bonds and funds, and because it is not a security the wash-sale rule is not applicable as of 2022.  Any investor that has lost value on a crypto position has the ability to sell the investment, capture the capital loss and reinvest back into the same cryptocurrency immediately without violating the wash-sale rule. So let’s say you bought 1 bitcoin when it was at $24,000 but feel confident in its long-term potential and so want to stay invested in it. You can sell that 1 bitcoin at today’s price, which is around $21,000. Then you can immediately re-buy 1 bitcoin at $21,000 and still claim the $3,000 capital loss. Of course this discounts any fees you may need to pay for the buy/sell transactions, but you can see how you can leverage this strategy and still stay long on bitcoin.  Additionally, capital losses in cryptocurrency do not have to be used to eliminate capital gains exclusively in crypto. These losses can be used to decrease tax liability on other asset classes like stocks, bonds, real estate and even $3,000 of earned income.  While it is much more enjoyable to have capital gains on crypto investments, savvy investors can utilize bear markets in order to lower their capital gains tax liability. Understanding the differences between tax-loss harvesting strategies in traditional asset classes and cryptocurrencies provides investors with a unique opportunity to improve the long-term profits of their diversified investment portfolios.

42411063,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBVaX,1668435319,"The State of Crypto Taxation in India: Past, Present and Future","India’s current fiscal year ending in March marks the first financial year where India, the country housing the largest percentage of crypto users in the world, is finally providing clarity on crypto taxes. Anyone who is a tax resident of India and makes money in crypto – whether they are a trader, miner, yield farmer or airdrop recipient – must declare their assets and pay a tax under the new Finance Bill of 2022.  This piece is a part of Tax Week, sponsored by Koinly.  Officially, though, India still hasn’t made its mind up about whether cryptocurrencies are even legal.  “[Whether crypto is] legitimate or illegitimate, it is a different question, but I will tax because it is a sovereign right to tax,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in February.  Lipsa Das is a freelance crypto writer and strategist based in India.  While the legality of crypto in India is still a matter of debate, the government has made moves to crack down on its usage – with multiple probes into major cryptocurrency exchanges and notices to high-net-worth individuals. Below, we explore how the regulatory landscape in India has evolved over the years and look at the impact that taxes have had on crypto.  A timeline of India’s crypto laws  The Reserve Bank of India and the government have historically been apprehensive about crypto transactions, with warnings and bans to the stringent new tax bill. Here’s a quick timeline of how crypto has fared over the years in India:  2013: The RBI issues a circular that warns investors about speculative investments such as cryptocurrencies.  2013-2017: Coupled with the movement toward digital payments in India, the crypto industry establishes its roots. Indian exchanges such as Zebbay and Unocoin start to gain traction.  2017: Two writ petitions are filed – one to ban cryptocurrencies and one to regulate cryptocurrencies. The government forms a regulatory body to investigate cryptocurrencies further.  2018: Despite multiple warnings by the RBI, Indian crypto markets add a record number of users. To counter that trend, the RBI issues a circular in April restricting banks and lenders from any association with crypto exchanges, effectively strangling the blossoming industry.  2019-2020: Indian exchanges and blockchain advocates go to court, filing multiple petitions in a bid to overturn the ban on cryptocurrency.  2020: After a drawn-out case, the Indian Supreme Court finally strikes down the RBI order, declaring it unconstitutional to prohibit trading without any regulations. That coincides with the crypto boom of 2020 and serves as the break the Indian crypto market desperately needs.  2021: The government continues its efforts to curtail the crypto industry by proposing a blanket ban on private currencies and introducing a private central bank digital currency instead.  2022: While crypto laws are still under discussion, the budget bill specifying crypto tax regulations is passed in March.  Prior to the budget bill of 2022, Indian government officials didn’t have an official stance on the taxation of cryptocurrencies, but that doesn’t mean the tokens weren’t taxed.  Any profits made from trading cryptocurrencies frequently were treated as “business or other income” and taxed as such. In contrast, if a taxpayer purchased crypto as an investment, it would be categorized as a capital asset, provided their overall trading activity was infrequent in nature. Upon sale of said cryptocurrencies, it would be subject to a long-term or short-term capital gains tax, depending on the holding period.  In the absence of a regulatory framework, there was no uniformity in how crypto transactions were reported, and in some cases, they weren’t reported at all. For instance, tax could be realized only when crypto was converted to fiat. So, if you were to swap two different cryptocurrencies on your MetaMask wallet, you weren’t legally required to report it.  The Finance Bill of 2022 initiated a complete overhaul of how cryptocurrencies are treated in India.  The new standard for crypto taxation  Effective since April 1, the Finance Bill is one of India's first laws to recognize cryptocurrencies. Importantly, it classifies cryptocurrencies as “virtual digital assets,” separating them from “currencies” backed by the central bank.  The definition of “virtual digital assets” is intentionally broad and covers all cryptocurrencies, tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens). But because the terminology is relatively new, the definition is still evolving. For instance, a circular dated June 30 exempted gift vouchers, reward points and subscriptions from being categorized as virtual digital assets, or VDAs.  So, what’s taxed?  According to 115BBH section of the Finance Bill, a taxable event is defined as:  1. Conversion of a VDA to Indian rupees or any other fiat currency.  2. Conversion of one type of virtual digital asset to another type (crypto-to-crypto trading, including stablecoins).  3. Paying for goods and services with a virtual digital asset.  All profits from the above transactions are subject to a 30% tax, which is equivalent to India's highest income tax bracket. There’s an additional surcharge that depends on the income bracket of the individual. Further, if the transaction exceeds 10,000 rupees, it will be taxed by an additional 1%.  Not all crypto transactions are subject to the 30% tax, though. Activities such as gifting crypto, staking rewards, receiving payments, airdrops, mining coins and other DeFi (decentralized finance) transactions are still viewed as “income.” In such instances, taxes are calculated according to the recipient’s income tax rate.  However, if you choose to hold the assets and sell them later, you will be liable to pay a 30% tax on any appreciation in asset market value.  What about losses?  One of the most criticized aspects of crypto tax law in India is that losses aren’t acknowledged, meaning you can’t offset capital gains with losses or business expenses. In an industry where losses are more common than profits, this clause is a clear attempt to curb cryptocurrency transactions.  The Impact on traders and retail investors  “The 1% TDS (tax deducted at source) doesn’t make high-frequency trading viable in India anymore. Traders lose 1% capital on each sale,” says Anoush Bhasin, a crypto tax adviser and founder of Quagmire Consulting.  The data confirms it: The introduction of these taxes combined with the bear market has caused the volumes on major exchanges to drop significantly. As a result, traders are forced to make more calculated decisions, factoring in the impact of taxes on the success of their trades. That they can’t offset their losing trades against their winning ones is the nail in the coffin.  “Furthermore, the TDS compliance burden makes filings very complex.” Bhasin added. “There is no regulatory clarity on TDS for decentralized exchanges, non-custodial wallets or custodial exchanges.”  There has been a significant shift amongst some crypto holders in India to a long-term holding mindset so as to avoid taxes – or at least make paying taxes worth it.  “India has drastically switched laws before, and the ones holding throughout the 2018-2020 ban were the ones who were the most benefited,” speculated a trader who wishes to remain anonymous. “At least my family doesn’t think I’m involved in something illegal now.”  The impact on new and existing crypto businesses  Blockchain consultants and lawyers are noticing a significant brain drain from India and an overall preference to set up shop in nations that are more crypto friendly.  “Existing businesses have moved overseas in the search for less complicated regulations,” said Bhasin. That includes major players such as the founders of crypto exchange WazirX and blockchain Polygon who have both relocated to Dubai.  “Over 40% of my blockchain clients have moved out of India, with Malta and Singapore being preferred destinations,” Vijay Pal Dalmia, an adviser for crypto businesses and an advocate in the Supreme Court of India, said.  A new ITR (tax) draft proposed by the Indian government may target companies and individuals that have moved abroad but still have business ties to India. The new proposal requires foreign entities and individuals to disclose investments in India.  “If this ITR draft [targets us], we would be forced to consider the possibility of disabling our crypto offerings for India. Of course, that wouldn’t be our first option,” said Aayushi Jain, co-founder of ZeroSwap, a Singapore-based decentralized exchange that has a lot of users in India.  The impact of the new regulations also depends on the specific type of business. Some companies have resorted to workarounds that allow them to accept crypto payments.  “For crypto payments, we use payroll systems such as Ontop that deposit Indian currency to [a] bank account within three days,” said Uddalak Das, a crypto marketing consultant. However, using such payment systems introduces a middleman – the very thing crypto aims to eliminate.  “The [majority of the] entities left operating in India are back-end tech or support service providers, which can deal simply in fiat and have no touchpoint with crypto,” Bhasin said.  Looking to the future  Most experts agree that India’s current tax laws hurt crypto and are regressive in nature. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, recently said that high taxes could “kill the industry” in India.

Authorities in the Caribbean country where FTX has its headquarters are investigating whether any criminal misconduct occurred in the exchange’s decline and bankruptcy. Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange went from being one of the world’s largest to filing for bankruptcy in barely a week, after a CoinDesk article raised questions about the financial stability of its sister company Alameda Research.  The native token of Binance-owned Trust Wallet soared 80% on Sunday after CEO Changpeng Zhao encouraged crypto users to take personal control of their digital assets. Zhao made the warning following the collapse of Binance’s rival FTX, which Binance briefly agreed to rescue before aborting its plan after it took a closer look at FTX’s balance sheet. Trust Wallet is a decentralized hot wallet facilitating the storage of cryptocurrencies. Its native token TWT allows holders to participate in decision making related to the app’s features. At the time of writing, TWT was up about 50% in the last 24 hours at $2.44, according to data by CoinMarketCap.  Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has attempted to assuage fears that the exchange could be the next to face a liquidity crisis. Crypto.com’s native token CRO has dropped around 45% in the last week, while its daily volume was down to about $284 million in October compared with last year’s highs of around $4 billion. In a YouTube interview, Marszalek reiterated that Crypto.com’s balance sheet is strong and its exposure to FTT was limited. He added that CRO, unlike FTX’s native token FTT, has never been used as loan collateral.  Chart of the Day  This chart shows similarities between the current bitcoin bear market and the 2018 market swoon.  The latest decline is reminiscent of the November 2018 capitulation that saw bitcoin drop nearly 50% to $3,200 precisely one year after the bull run peaked.

42411329,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMznz,1668432584,"Let’s Actually Commit to Proofs of Reserve This Time, OK?","I’m not going to mince words. The fraud-driven collapse of FTX and Alameda Research is, in my estimation, the worst single event in the crypto industry since its inception.  Even though as a share of overall crypto market cap the impact may have been less in relative terms than Mt. Gox was, the fallout will be more significant. For one, no one really thought of Gox as a particularly credible institution. It wasn't “institutional” in any way.  Mark Karpeles, who was the CEO of Mt. Gox, didn’t go on a charm offensive in Washington, D.C., to win favor from politicians. Mt. Gox didn’t air Super Bowl ads. Celebrities didn’t line up to endorse the platform. And crucially, the number of users worldwide were much fewer.  CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.  FTX, by contrast, served millions of users worldwide. It catered to numerous funds, institutions and startups. It was aggressive in promoting itself to mainstream users. Its enigmatic CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, practically lived in Washington, charming members of Congress and financial regulators. The exchange was widely considered one of the most trusted and credible institutions in the industry. The apparent fraud and collapse was therefore particularly catastrophic, because it happened so quickly and took almost everyone by surprise.  Few silver linings  The fallout will linger for years. Silver linings are few. I will admit to having breathed a sigh of relief at SBF’s discrediting. His agenda was fundamentally hostile to DeFi (decentralized finance); his interests seemed to extend only to obtaining a regulatory baptism for his firm and no one else. He was an unrepresentative and non-aligned ambassador in Washington, and I’m glad he will no longer be representing us in policy conversations.  The other considerable bright spot to emerge from this mess is the renewed industry interest in proofs of reserve. The more serious among us have been contemplating how we can win back trust among end users and regulators. Some in Washington will naturally call for exchanges to be more heavily regulated, under the guise of consumer protection. Some crypto natives are redoubling their efforts on DeFi and DEXs (decentralized exchanges), considering CeFi (centralized finance) to be a lost cause. And Bitcoin maxis are bleating to no one in particular about how all centralized institutions are frauds.  None of those three approaches makes sense to me. Bitcoin preachers will never convince everyone to adopt a rigorous self-custodial setup. There are no indications whatsoever of their imminent glorious hyper-bitcoinized, non-intermediated future. Centralized custodians, lenders and exchanges have existed for over a decade and will continue to be useful and necessary. This is not out of step with a core Bitcoin ethos either – software developer Hal Finney famously advocated for a “free banking” approach to Bitcoin.  Listen: NLW – Why Proof-of-Reserves Now  The pro-regulatory crowd would throw the baby out with the bathwater. A crypto industry that replicates the legacy banking sector would achieve little. It’s critical we do everything to preserve the interoperability of the crypto sector and eliminate barriers to entry and regulatory capture. Elevating a handful of centralized exchanges and raising barriers to entry for competitors, as SBF sought to do, would make it far easier for regulators to capture the entire industry by tightly managing a few choke points.  And lastly the DeFi- and DEXs-only crowd misses the mark. Pure DeFi isn’t without reproach – Terra/LUNA could, for instance, be called DeFi. Hacks and rugpulls are plentiful. And, of course, DeFi users need to hold their assets in self-custody, which, while being the premise of DeFi, is a nonstarter for the vast majority of people.  The fact is, while the average user should have the ability to withdraw funds and transact with them outside of an intermediated system, most users won't choose to do that. We can admit the reality that many users will always prefer intermediation, while pushing to improve the quality of these intermediaries.  Time for proofs of reserve  That’s where proof of reserve comes in. Proofs of reserve harmonize the innate transparency of blockchains with the convenience of centralized custodians. The procedure generally refers to a demonstration undertaken by exchanges proving that they possess client assets to match outstanding liabilities.  There was a minor wave of proof of reserve enthusiasm post-Gox, which immediately fizzled out, and a slight renaissance starting summer 2021 with BitMEX’s proof of reserves and liabilities, followed by Kraken’s effort this past February. Things didn’t move very fast thereafter, despite my ardent lobbying. Reform must wait for a crisis, it appears.  Post-FTX, a new enthusiasm for proofs of reserve has emerged. A number of exchanges – at a minimum Binance, Gate.io, KuCoin, Poloniex, Bitget, Huobi, OKX, Deribit and Bybit – have indicated their attention to publish proofs of reserve. A few such as Crypto.com, Bitfinex and Binance have taken the intermediate step of releasing wallet addresses as a crude proof of assets. But this is incomplete without corresponding liabilities.  The asset side is trivial: It can involve publishing wallet addresses or signing a transaction. The tricky part is matching the assets with the outstanding liabilities. To achieve that, an exchange adds up all user balances, anonymizes them and publishes the data in Merkelized format. From there, depositors can verify that they are included in the liability set. If enough do this, they can have strong confidence that the exchange isn’t cheating by omitting liabilities. And if the process happens under the eye of an auditor, users can gain additional assurance that no liabilities are being excluded.  Read more: George Kaloudis – All Custodial Crypto Exchanges Should Adopt Proof-of-Reserve Programs, but Even That Isn’t Enough  Cynics and Bitcoin maxis tend to protest that proofs of reserve aren’t perfectly trustless. Of course, there aren't – nothing is – but critics would sacrifice the perfect at the altar of the good. There has been a brouhaha in recent days about major exchanges engaging in asset snapshots with purportedly borrowed funds, and many are using this to write off proofs of reserve entirely. (Some of these accusations were later shown to be unfounded.) Writing off proofs of reserve because some weak implementations weren’t credible is the equivalent of ordering Little Caesars pizza and assuming all Italian food is garbage.  A stronger system  A point-in-time asset snapshot without the supervision of an auditor or a cash-flow analysis proves very little. The proofs of reserve I and others talk about involves ongoing, frequent attestations, ideally supervised by an auditor. In its more complete form, it provides very strong assurances.  Recalcitrant exchanges have few excuses left. Compared with the first rush for proofs of reserve in 2014/15, there are far more resources available today. The 2021 practitioner’s guide to proof of reserve, published by myself and a few other collaborators by the Digital Chamber, offers a full picture.  The BitMEX proofs of reserve open-source code and a guide to replicating the procedure is available. And to the critics who bemoan the lack of accounting firms with expertise in facilitating the process – that is no longer true. Top 20 audit firm Armanino has been undertaking these engagements for years, and it isn't the only one.  During a bull market, I can understand why exchanges wouldn't bother competing based on credibility. But in a time of consolidation, retaining user trust is absolutely vital. This procedure allows exchanges to be far more transparent than their TradFi counterparts that cannot independently verify user assets held.  Regulators, I expect, will come to demand it. Already proofs of reserve received a mention in Wyoming’s SPDI (special purpose depository institution) rules, and I imagine it will appear in more legislation soon.  Read more: David Z. Morris – Nic Carter vs. The Bitcoin Maximalists  Now with so many exchanges – including market leader Binance – embracing the procedure, the few not participating will raise eyebrows. When pressed, Coinbase’s Emilie Choi protested that the exchange is already audited and that this should be a sufficient substitute. But if Coinbase cares about the integrity of the industry, it will undertake the procedure anyway. I would much rather depositors have the option to choose between a variety of public and non-public exchanges, all doing PoR, rather than being limited to a handful of public exchanges doing quarterly disclosures through the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Let’s be clear. A proof of reserve wouldn’t have “stopped” FTX, Quadriga or Mt. Gox. All three were insolvent for long periods of time because of either fraud or hacks. But in a world where proofs of reserve become the norm, their refusal or inability to perform a proof of reserve would have stuck out like a sore thumb and alerted users that something was likely awry. So proofs of reserve, at the industry scale, works via negativa – it’s most telling if you don’t do it.  In the next few months and years, as proofs of reserve become more common throughout the industry, I hope and expect that we will apply the same scrutiny to the remaining holdouts.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | BNB,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/14/lets-actually-commit-to-proofs-of-reserve-this-time-ok,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31df6df74ba179d9a7d524c58b0bf3ad808cab7e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388668,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQJHb,1668426453,"There Was No Cause to Add FTX to Investor Alert List Before Collapse, Singapore's MAS Says","Global cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s dramatic fall through last week, ending in a bankruptcy filing in the U.S., left Twitter dense with rumors about how stakeholders worldwide – already spooked by widespread market contagion from earlier in the year – might be affected by the fresh collapse.  When Binance announced its plans to potentially purchase the embattled FTX’s non-U.S. business last Tuesday in a now-scrapped deal, retail crypto investors were confused about what was going to happen to their funds locked in FTX.com.  A number of Twitter posts alleged crypto investors in Singapore had turned to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX over Binance after the latter withdrew its bid to get regulatory approval in the country last year and was placed on the regulator’s Investor Alert List (IAL).  Some Twitter users pointed fingers at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which is responsible for regulating and licensing crypto operators, for having targeted Binance and let FTX.com continue to serve customers in the country.  MAS only lists entities that may be “wrongly perceived” as being locally regulated on the IAL, as was the case for Binance.com, the MAS said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.  “It would not be meaningful for MAS to list all unlicensed entities on the IAL. MAS did not have cause to list FTX on the same basis as Binance,” the regulator said.  Although Singapore regulators haven’t made any moves on FTX yet, the MAS had previously vowed to crack down on “bad” crypto operators in the country. The warning came after a number of big industry names with ties to Singapore – like crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and exchange platform Vauld – bit the dust earlier this year.  During FTX’s quick demise, the securities regulator in the Bahamas, where the company was headquartered, moved to freeze assets tied to FTX. Japan’s Financial Services Agency also ordered FTX’s local arm to suspend all operations. On Friday, Cyprus suspended a license it approved for the exchange in September. FTX is also facing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe.  Read more: Singapore Central Bank Proposes Stablecoin Rules to Rein In Crypto Sector  Similar actions could be expected in Singapore if there's a reason for it, Chia Hock Lai, co-chairman at Blockchain Association Singapore said in an interview with CoinDesk. Regulations in general, particularly related to securities trading, are likely to tighten, according to Chia.  The MAS has already proposed regulations that could limit inexperienced retail investors from accessing crypto markets, along with standards for issuers of crypto stablecoins that are pegged to the value of other assets like the U.S. dollar.  “I think that this will further convince the MAS that what it did is correct,” Chia said, referring to the MAS’ initiatives to further regulate the sector and curtail retail investor participation.  For now, MAS clarified that FTX.com does not operate in Singapore, and that it’s neither licensed nor exempted from licensing in the country.  “It is not possible, however, to prevent Singapore users from directly accessing overseas service providers. FTX.com was therefore able to onboard Singapore users,” the central bank said. “MAS has consistently reminded the public of the risks of dealing with unlicensed entities.”  It also clarified that Binance was not banned in Singapore.  “Binance did not have the requisite license to solicit customers from Singapore and had to cease doing so,” the statement said.  Quoine  FTX’s insolvency filing from Friday listed 134 entities tied to Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto enterprise seeking bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Among the listed, was its Singapore subsidiary Quoine Pte. Ltd, which also operates crypto exchange Liquid (another entity listed in the filing).  Responding to questions raised about why FTX.com’s Singapore users have not migrated to its subsidiary in Singapore, MAS said that FTX.com and Quoine operate as separate legal entities.  “Quoine is currently exempt from licensing while its license application is under review. MAS is carefully reviewing the application, taking into account recent developments,” MAS said, adding that it has not required FTX.com to migrate Singapore users to Quoine.  Read more: FTX Employees Worldwide Learned of Bankruptcy Along With the Public  Retail investors  MAS issued a consultation paper on Oct. 26 proposing regulatory measures to restrict retail investors’ participation in crypto markets to reduce risk exposure. The proposed rules include crypto service providers to set up a test designed to gauge retail traders’ experience.  Singapore doesn’t have a large retail market for crypto, but the introduced measures are “very comprehensive” and verge on overregulation, according to Chia.  “Because, for example, if investors already go through the risk assessment test, there's no need to curtail them from using credit cards to make payments or to ban service providers from providing incentives,” Chia said.  Consumers must continue to exercise utmost caution when trading in cryptocurrency, the MAS told CoinDesk.  “Digital payment token service providers licensed by MAS under the Payment Services Act are regulated for money laundering and terrorism financing risks as well as technology risks, but not safety and soundness,” MAS said.  This means operators are not subject to risk-based capital or liquidity requirements, and they are not required to safeguard customer funds or digital tokens from insolvency risk, the regulator explained.  “Regulations cannot protect consumers from losses arising from the inherently speculative and highly risky nature of cryptocurrency trading,” the MAS said.

Goldman took a bearish stance on Coinbase's stock, cutting its price target to $41 from $49, and maintaining its ""sell rating.""  The Wall Street giant also sees FTX's collapse having a limited impact on trading and investing app Robinhood, as crypto related revenues accounted for just 9% of the platform's total revenue. Goldman analysts revised the 12-month price target for Robinhood's stock (HOOD) from $13 to $12.50.  Coinbase's highly liquid balance sheet and lack of proprietary trading activities shield the Nasdaq-listed exchange from ramifications of FTX's situation, Goldman's equity research team said in a note sent to clients on Friday.  The team expects the FTX-induced market volatility and investor unease about less regulated exchanges to bode well for Coinbase in the near term.

42388666,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQJQx,1668424532,Morgan Stanley Says There Is Still Much Leverage in the Crypto Ecosystem,"The collapse of FTX and Alameda has sparked another round of deleveraging in crypto markets, and that’s likely to spur more “crypto quantitative tightening,” Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report Friday.  Creditors are selling digital assets to cover their risks, adding to market volatility, and are likely to reveal their exposures in the next few weeks. The spillover to equity markets so far is limited because crypto firms mainly lend to each other, the report said.  Morgan Stanley says many events have led to the latest bout of volatility in the crypto market, but the key question is “how to value crypto tokens that offer a service but don’t offer the token holder a stake in the company (like equity) or a claim on assets in the case of a default (like debt.)”  In a bull market using such a token as collateral to leverage seems fine, but the strategy is risky in a bear market, the bank added.  The bear market in bitcoin started almost a year ago and it has been mainly institutions who have been selling, the note said. Retail investors are still holding on to their positions.  With bitcoin (BTC) now trading under $18,000, there isn’t a clear technical support level before $12,500, the bank said. It estimates that anyone that bought or received BTC in the past 12-18 months has an average breakeven price of around $45,000.  “Retail investors may start to sell if BTC trades below $10,000,” it added.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending is proving to be resilient at the moment, as it was in June following the Terra/LUNA collapse, because it is over collateralized. “CeFi lending is where there were problems,” the note added.  DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on blockchains.

42388672,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQJez,1668416802,"Crypto.com CEO Dismisses Speculation of Financial Trouble, Says FTX Exposure Is Minimal","Expect a tough crypto winter, but Crypto.com isn’t going anywhere, CEO Kris Marszalek said during a live interview hosted on its YouTube channel.  Over the past week, Crypto.com’s CRO token has dropped almost 45% on concerns the Singapore-based exchange will be the next to face a liquidity crisis. The exchange’s daily volume has collapsed from last year's highs of around $4 billion to about $284 million this past October, according to data from Nomics, and withdrawals are on their way back up as users and investors remove their funds from the platform.  In the interview, Marszalek reiterated that the exchange has a strong balance sheet and said its exposure to FTX was limited to $10 million, down from a possible $1 billion in business the two exchanges had together earlier.  “We recovered $990 million from FTX,” Marszalek said, pointing out that fund flows between exchanges are a necessary part of the business.  He also said that 20% of Crypto.com's reserves are in Shibu Inu coin because that's what the customers trade, and everything in its reserves is backed 1-to-1 versus customer crypto deposits.  An audit of Crypto.com is underway, but it will take some time. Audit firms “don’t work at crypto speed,” he said, emphasizing that Crypto.com and the industry both need full transparency to move forward.  Withdrawals are working as expected, he reiterated. The only stoppage has been related to GALA, SRM, and Ray.  “SRM is closely tied to FTX,” he said.  Marszalek said that CRO, Crypto.com’s token, has never been used as loan collateral, unlike the relationship between FTX and Alameda and FTX's token, FTT.  “We’re never going to raise funds,” he added, stating that the business is cash flow positive.  Stadium curse?  One of Crypto.com’s more controversial moves has been stadium sponsorship, with eye-watering price tags. There are questions about how effective the whole thing is as a sales funnel. Marszalek says it is a worthwhile investment, reminding people that the contracts are paid yearly.  “We pay a small amount every year, which amounts to around 10% of our revenue. This is not crazy compared to other companies,” he said. “Growth to 70 million users is not possible without some investment into brand awareness.”  Part of the market’s mistrust of Crypto.com might stem from the exchange’s recent $400 million mishap, where it accidentally sent ether to an account at an exchange called Gate.io. That was the second time the company had mistakenly transferred an amount in the millions. In August, it was revealed the exchange had sent $10.5 million to a woman in Melbourne, and took seven months to notice.  Marszalek explained that all addresses for transfers of these scales are whitelisted and approved. The destination address was Crypto.com’s corporate account at Gate.io, and the funds were returned after Gate.io raised the corporate account’s daily transfer limit.  “The funds were at no risk of being lost,” Marszalek said. “The system would not allow us to send money somewhere it can’t be recovered.”  While some on crypto Twitter have speculated that this was part of a scheme to bolster Gate.io’s holdings before its proof of reserves were published, Marszalek said this was not the case.  As for Crypto.com’s critics Marszalek says he’s looking forward to proving them wrong with actions and words.  “Their allegations have no substance,” he said.",NEUTRAL,CRO | GALA | FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | CRO | GALA | FTT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/14/cryptocom-ceo-dismisses-speculation-of-financial-trouble-says-ftx-exposure-is-minimal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3581ff70f66e02eee3cfd9d0508e60f52a86a35-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the past seven days, the balance held in miner wallets has declined by 9,402 BTC to a ten-month low of 1.826 million BTC ($30.6 billion), according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  The miner net position change, or the 30-day change of BTC supply held in miner addresses, slipped to -10,972 BTC on Thursday, the lowest since early January.  Bitcoin miners solve complex algorithmic problems to mine blocks and verify transactions in return for rewards paid in BTC. In other words, the miner profitability is heavily dependent on the cryptocurrency's price. Therefore, miners tend to run down their inventory in a bleeding market to stay afloat.  Bitcoin fell by 22% in the seven days to Nov. 13, its biggest decline since June, as the collapse of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange dented investor confidence and triggered contagion fears.  The sell-off could continue in the days ahead, analysts told CoinDesk. That would worsen the situation for miners, who have been facing high operational costs.  ""Bitcoin mining companies have struggled this year, with the fall in the price of the largest cryptocurrency and rising energy prices (and operating costs) leading to a decline in revenue. As a result of this, mining firms have been heavily selling their underlying holdings, leading to significant net outflows over the last six months,"" data provider CryptoCompare said in the October review.  Charles Edwards, CEO of asset manager Capriole, recently voiced a similar opinion on Twitter, saying, ""bitcoin's electrical cost has just been breached for the 2nd time only in 5 years. The electrical bill for the average miner is now greater than the income earnt.""  ""Many Bitcoin miners are now turning their rigs off,"" Edwards added.  According to Blockware Solutions, a continued BTC price slide toward $15,000, would not necessarily see miners immediately turn of their machines.  ""Many miners have PPAs [power purchase agreements] and hosting contracts that require them to consume energy or potentially pay an additional fee. Many miners will likely continue mining at a loss in the short term until either the price of BTC goes back up, or they exit their operation altogether,"" Blockware's latest weekly newsletter said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/14/bitcoin-miner-balance-slides-as-ftx-collapse-weighs-over-crypto-prices,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acc3d2b496dc72cdbee9538c0ad6f22e01097e86-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388667,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQJCv,1668393942,"After Bitcoin's Worst Week in 5 Months, Here's What Crypto Analysts Are Saying","Bitcoin (BTC) fell 22% in the seven-day stretch through Sunday, and analysts are scrambling to assess the outlook – for digital-asset markets as well as possible policy ramifications – amid an annus horribilis for the blockchain industry, freshly wounded by the FTX scandal.  As a new week starts, the market is still searching for a bottom: The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is down 0.8% over the past 24 hours.  Here's a sampling of the commentary:  Sean Farrell, head of digital-asset strategy, FundStrat: ""In the past six months, we have witnessed the unraveling of a web of leverage that entangled the crypto space. It started with LUNA/UST, seemingly resolved in the 3AC unwind, only to find that SBF now appears to have been insolvent as well. ... We think it is appropriate to wait for lower lows as there is good reason to think that there will be other casualties, which could lead to forced selling or, at the very least, bad headline risk.""  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital: ""The last few days have seen the space shaken by the collapse of SBF's empire, and expectedly, despite traditional markets showing some strength, BTC and crypto took a hit due to poor sentiment. Even though BTC has settled around $16,000 for now, the extent of the damage to other companies, funds, exchanges is as yet unknown, and may come to the fore in the weeks to come. As before, we believe BTC under $20,000 is an attractive long-term accumulation zone, but we also remain cautious until the current situation is satisfactorily resolved and sentiment appears to start moving toward relative normalcy. Notably, the last few days have seen a significant drop in exchange reserves for BTC and stablecoins, indicating a lack of trust and prevalence of fear in the market. We will be monitoring for signs of returning confidence among the masses as a positive indicator.""  David Duong, head of institutional research, Coinbase: ""The relative crypto market stability of recent months was interrupted. ... We have seen broader market instability despite some positive macro developments for risk assets as a whole. ... It’s still emerging which counterparties may have lent or interacted with either FTX or Alameda and what those exact liabilities are. ... BTC could not only retest 2022 lows but touch the $13K level. ... We think there is support at $13.5K.""  Arcane Research newsletter: ""This situation is a mess. ... One of the largest crypto companies in the industry was playing with customers’ money. An embarrassment for the industry, but it also reminds us of what an unregulated Wild West this still is. The contagion from this will undoubtedly evolve over the next weeks.""  Galaxy Digital newsletter: ""It’s likely that FTX depositors who still have funds stuck on the exchange will be considered unsecured creditors and face a lengthy legal process. While several firms have proactively and publicly offered some transparency on exposure to FTX, the totality of industry exposure remains unknown at this time... An enormous amount of money is at stake (perhaps lost), but the impact of FTX’s collapse is even further magnified by the exchange’s wide-ranging marketing efforts and Sam Bankman-Fried's prominence ... The size of his advocacy and extremeness of his collapse cannot be understated and will have long-lasting ripple effects in Washington for crypto policy.""  GSR weekly crypto recap: ""It’s sad that 2022 in crypto hasn’t been about the potential of crypto but rather about leverage, greed, fraud and lack of transparency – the very things the people involved accused TradFi of and vowed to change.""  Pantera Capital's Blockchain Letter: ""In the short term, there will be pain for those who lost funds held on FTX’s exchange. More broadly, we expect further price volatility across the crypto ecosystem as fears of contagion drive asset holders to adjust their portfolios. Assets linked to FTX (Solana and projects built on it, Aptos, etc.) will likely be hit hardest. ...The episode will also probably be a setback to adoption, as some retail users who lost funds choose to leave the space, and others who may have joined sooner are scared into staying on the sidelines. We expect institutions previously wary of the space to deepen their skepticism.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/14/after-bitcoins-worst-week-in-five-months-heres-what-crypto-analysts-are-saying,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db05cc23b64f57d3000e3cb006904dcff42ac8f6-636x323.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Last week's calamitous collapse of the FTX exchange sent crypto markets for their worst seven-day stretch since the mid-June aftermath of the Terra blockchain's meltdown. A giant hack over the weekend just made things worse. Analysts in digital-asset markets are processing it all and forecasting what comes next.  Insights: SEC's unwillingness to disclose William Hinman's speech, arguably one of the most important speeches in crypto's history, highlights the agency's efforts to shape its case against Ripple.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  It goes without saying that last week's collapse of the FTX exchange represents one of the crypto industry's worst-ever episodes, clearly reflected in digital-asset markets: The price of bellwether bitcoin (BTC) tumbled 22% in the seven days through Sunday, its worst weekly performance since mid-June, when traders were grappling with the aftermath of the Terra blockchain's collapse. (Here's a timeline of key FTX developments, showing how the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) of 162 digital assets traded through it all.)  Things got incrementally worse over the weekend when FTX and its U.S. subsidiary, FTX US, became victims of an attack that drained hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto out of the exchanges' wallets. The crypto exchanges Binance and Huobi scrambled to block deposits of FTT, FTX's native tokens, after about $400 million of the tokens were unexpectedly released out of schedule, with no official explanation. The stablecoin issuer Tether blocked addresses tied to the FTX account drainer's wallets.  Crypto analysts are assessing what comes next for ailing digital-asset markets and policy ramifications for the reputation-wounded blockchain industry. Researchers at Coinbase Institutional say bitcoin, currently around $16,236, might be looking at a further price drop, possibly as low as $13,500.  One industry reform seems to be gaining momentum: Centralized crypto exchanges are being pushed to provide proof of reserves. It may take a lot more than that, and perhaps months, before the industry starts to regain public confidence. The widely-monitored Crypto Fear & Greed Index is signaling ""extreme fear.""  ""Even though BTC has settled around $16,000 for now, the extent of the damage to other companies, funds, exchanges is as yet unknown, and may come to the fore in the weeks to come,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital. ""We remain cautious until the current situation is satisfactorily resolved and sentiment appears to start moving toward relative normalcy.""  Insights  By Sam Reynolds  The SEC is keeping emails and notes that led to one of the most important speeches in crypto’s history secret from CoinDesk.  In 2018, William Hinman, the then-Director of Corporation Finance at the SEC Commission, gave a speech at the Yahoo Markets Summit that proved to be a watershed moment for crypto: Ether is not a security.  Ether, Hinman said at the time, had become “sufficiently decentralized” and thus moved past its nebulous status of security-not-a-security to commodity.  “Based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network, and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions,” a copy of the speech reads. “Purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts.”  Ripple has taken great interest in this as they were sued in December 2020 by the SEC on the basis that they were offering unregistered securities via an initial coin offering. Ripple filed suit against the SEC requesting drafts of the speech along with internal notes and received a favorable ruling in January 2022.  In late September, Ripple received a huge win in its case when a U.S. judge told the SEC to release emails and other correspondence. “I can say that it was well worth the fight to get them,” Ripple’s General Counsel Stu Alderoty tweeted.  But these remain confidential. CoinDesk attempted a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain these documents, but the 71 documents that were sent were heavily redacted.  The SEC said that it was unable to release the unredacted documents as they were “prepared in anticipation of litigation, forms an integral part of the pre-decisional process, and/or contains advice given to the Commission or senior staff by the Commission’s attorneys.”  It also noted that the release of the documents would constitute an “unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”  What is visible is a massive email thread that took place over the course of two weeks where drafts of the speech were shopped around the Commission.  A whole cast of characters from the SEC weighed in, including Jay Clayton, the then SEC chair, Lucas Moskowitz, its former chief of staff, David Fredrickson, a senior legal advisor, Jennifer McHugh, an acting associate director of the Disclosure Review, as well as Valerie Szczepanik, head of its strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology.  We don’t know what was said in this email chain, but there certainly was a lot of input from the Commission. Fredrickson, in his role as legal advisor, made some edits. Szczepanik also weighed in along with McHugh.  The input from senior Commission staff might undermine the argument that Hinman’s speech was his own opinion and “not necessarily that of the Commission.” The SEC wants the market to think that this speech wasn’t guidance, but it sure looks like the SEC provided a lot of guidance in its drafting.  In an earlier interview with CoinDesk during Singapore FinTech Week, Alderoty, Ripple’s counsel, called the SEC’s current approach to crypto a failure that runs the risk of driving the digital assets industry offshore as there’s no “clear regulatory framework”. In Fortune, he wrote that Hinman’s talk was ‘the speech that muddied the crypto waters’.  “It has not provided clarity, and it's pushing innovation offshore to other economic centers like Singapore. And it's hurting the very retail consumer in the U.S. that the SEC is supposed to protect,” he said. “If the US gets this wrong, they're going to lose their position as a leader in this new financial economy.”  The case between Ripple and the SEC will likely be drawing to a close early next year (there were court dates planned for November, but extensions were granted).  Alderoty seems happy with the version of documents the SEC provided him. All this should make for an interesting next court appearance.
