42427332,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QZh,1485906932,Greg Maxwell Breaks Down Blockchain: The 'Uncontrollable Noun',"""The comments were spot on, but a little vague.""  While bitcoin has created an economic network without a central authority, the chief technology officer at one of its leading development firms, VC-backed Blockstream, believes the chair of the US central bank has been largely accurate in her attempts to explain blockchain.  In a morning address at CoinDesk’s Construct 2017 today, Maxwell addressed statements by Janet Yellen, commending her for acknowledging bitcoin as part of the broader blockchain conversation, even as he admitted his distaste for the broad label.  Overall, the remarks offered a high-level view of how one of bitcoin's most esteemed and longest-tenured developers views recent developments in the ecosystem, including the increasing interest in ""permissioned"" versions of the technology that seek to alter its model.  Maxwell admitted to a certain amount of indecision on the matter, arguing at once that it's impossible to overhype blockchain technology, even while arguing that there's a risk that it is ""so awesome"" that its attributes could be overstated.  He told the audience:  ""We have to sort through the hype. We have to understand what's meaningful use, what changes the world and what’s boring.""  Overall, Maxwell noted that 'blockchain' is many things to many people, and that this broad appeal has diluted or fragmented its meaning.  Yet, he framed bitcoin as unique, calling it a “revolutionary” idea, though one he argued is proving best for issues where ""dispute resolution"" is a necessary component of the system.  He contends that while elements of bitcoin (like its proof-of-work consensus) aren’t necessarily optimized for networks of trusted parties, the fundamental premise that private companies are environments in which every actor is trusted is questionable.  ""The notion that you can trust everyone inside your organization is a failed security practice. Any system that isn't secure on the Internet probably can’t be secured on a private network,"" he continued.  Blockstream has so far raised $76m in funding for experimental ideas like its in-development sidechains network, while inking partnerships with more traditional financial firms like PwC.  Don't forget bitcoin  Maxwell went on to address the argument of why it might not be possible to have ""blockchain without bitcoin"", illustrating how he believes the underlying innovation is diminished (or wholly different) in some ways without an incentive.  ""This begs the question what the heck is a blockchain?"" he said. ""I don’t think the blockchain part of bitcoin is what they’re talking about when they’re using blockchain technologies.""  Rather, Maxwell positioned digital signatures as the part of the technology that most appeals to incumbents, though he said the tech is ""not new at all"".  ""A digital signature is more of a seal. It allows you to authorize a document. I say seal because it locks together. It's like a wax stamp,"" he said. ""But, by itself it’s not that terribly exciting.""  He went on to frame proof-of-work and smart contracts (in which a blockchain uses code to automate interactions between parties), as the ""next core technologies"" in the system.  He said:  ""Each of these technologies is interesting on its own. But in bitcoin each part works together to amplify its benefits. These tools are important and powerful and useful, but they’re not magic.""  The ultimate choice  Interestingly, Maxwell's case for bitcoin remains largely unchanged from what it was years ago, when he detailed how he went from a skeptic to a believer in the open-source platform.  He argued today that, even in the age of blockchain, bitcoin is at once a new kind of money that arises ""purely from network effect"" and a novel and fragile cryptographic protocol.  ""One of the challenges with bitcoin is it inspires some hard questions. If you think about bitcoin, you think about money, it begs us to ask, 'Who do we trust?', ‘Why do we trust them?’ and 'What are the risk and costs of those interactions?'"" he said.  He noted that, academically, the big choice is that, now that the technology is possible, it remains to be seen what users will prefer when both types of networks are operational at scale.  He asked:  ""If public is given a choice, what kind of money would they prefer to use?""

42427310,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Q5h,1485893356,Germany’s Central Bank Details Blockchain Trading Test Results,"For Germany’s central bank, blockchain has proven to be a promising – if somewhat complicated – technology.  In late November, the Deutsche Bundesbank announced that it was working with exchange operator Deutsche Börse on a securities trading trial, using blockchain as a means of exchanging digitized securities, while also creating a record of those transactions. At the time, the central bank described the test as ""purely a conceptual study"".  New comments from Bundesbank executive board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele have shone a light on some of the results from that test. Thiele was speaking during a G20 conference on financial technology and innovation, an event that has seen other central bank figures, including Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann and Bank of England chief Mark Carney, remark on the tech.  While both Weidmann and Carney spoke largely in broad strokes, it was Thiele who dove a bit deeper into some of the work the Bundesbank has been undertaking on the blockchain front.  According to Thiele, the system ""works"" – but will require some refinement if it’s ever to reach a point of commercial scale, describing it as ""far from being market-ready"".  He told attendees:  ""Our conceptual study shows that blockchain technology can be adapted to meet the current needs and requirements of the financial system. The prototype works. Having said that, its further development for mass use is still presenting many challenges.""  As for those challenges, Thiele questioned whether the prototype, in its current form, could be used on a wider scale or whether it would be worth its cost in the long-run.  That said, Thiele indicated that the Bundesbank would continue to refine the prototype and gather data.  ""With this as our starting point, we aim to develop a technically more sophisticated prototype, capable of providing information on technical performance and thus allowing comparison with our present settlement infrastructure,"" he concluded.

42427319,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QJh,1485883577,NH Legislators Seek Money Transmission Exemption for Bitcoin Startups,"Legislators in New Hampshire have filed a new bill that aims to clarify rules around digital currencies and money transmitters.  HB 436  , filed on 12th January, seeks to add a formal definition for ""virtual currency"" to the state’s laws, as well as create an exception from money transmission requirements for ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"".  The bill would also add a clause to the definition of a digital currency money transmitter, a designation which, if passed, would include ""maintaining control of virtual currency on behalf of others"".  That said, the proposal isn't exactly cut-and-dry. The bill does not specify which kinds of ""business"" would be covered, potentially leaving a gap within which sellers might fall.  The measure appears to be a response to state regulation, which became official last year, that made it so bitcoin sellers in the state are considered money transmitters, requiring them to be licensed and bonded as a result.  The bill goes on to add a definition for ""virtual currency"", which reads:  ""'Virtual currency' means a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded and functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value but does not have legal tender status as recognized by the United States government.""  The bill is sponsored by Representative Barbara Biggie, with Representative Keith Ammon as co-sponsor. The first hearing on the bill has already been held, a recording of which can be found here. The next hearing, before the New Hampshire House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee, is set to take place tomorrow.  Notably, HB 436 isn’t the first time legislators in NH have considered bills related to bitcoin. In 2015, a proposal was put forward to allow residents to pay their tax bills with bitcoin. That measure was later scuttled, but supporters at the time said they planned to re-file the bill.

42427327,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QVh,1485878427,Construct 2017: Life After SegWit? Bitcoin Gridlock Takes the Stage,"""It's contingent upon SegWit.""  Lightning Labs developer Joseph Poon is talking about bitcoin's Lightning Network, the top-layer network that could potentially boost bitcoin's transaction capacity to millions of transactions per second, but the same can be said of most of the other technical improvements for the network presented at Construct 2017, CoinDesk's inaugural San Francisco developer conference.  In many presentations, it seemed as if moving forward with the project, a more than $15bn economic network that sprang from only open-source code, is wholly dependent on SegWit.  The problem, of course, is that (for a complex set of technical and political reasons) it might not activate, a factor that continues to put stress on its development team.  Politecnico di Milano professor Ferdinando M Ametrano told CoinDesk:  ""From the technical point of view, SegWit is crucial for bitcoin's evolution.""  Murmurings from other attendees seemed to bolster this view, but any action still seems far. As of Tuesday, one new mining pool is flagging support for the change.  If it continues to do so, this will bring support for the upgrade up to 30% or 31%. Still, it's short of the required threshold of 95% necessary for activation.  Lesser-known fixes  One of the best-known benefits is Lightning Network. SegWit moves around transaction data in such a way that it solves a problem known as ""transaction malleability,"" which makes transactions using the top-layer network more secure and user-friendly.  ""You can kind of make it work without SegWit. The problem is that it sucks,"" Poon explained in his presentation.  Elsewhere, others made a similar argument.  The most obvious presentation to dive into examples was Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo's presentation on SegWit, where he called it ""the most exciting thing"" he's worked on so far as a bitcoin developer.  He mentioned that it can help enable more advanced scripting, meaning that bitcoin users can lock up their funds in other new ways, and that it would enable different signature schemes, such as Schnorr signatures or even signatures that are resistant to quantum computers.  And, other attendees were quick to point out other pieces.  ""I think that more technical issues might be lost, like that signature validation will become linear rather than quadratic,"" Ametrano said.  In conversation, Lightning Labs developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun further noted how it makes transactions safer for users of hardware wallets.  Political stalemate  Although most of bitcoin’s active developers support the change, some still believe it's proven contentious.  Drew Rasmussen, CTO of OTCXN, a startup looking to apply blockchain to the forex market, talked about it more from the frame of reference of a bitcoin outsider who's been more focused in the enterprise blockchain work.  ""I think it would be something good to implement,"" he said, though he acknowledged that the community's skepticism of changes could be what's holding it back.  So, what happens if it doesn’t activate?  Despite the seeming urgency around the change, Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields, who also works at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, said he doesn't yet believe he's heard a compelling argument for why it shouldn't be activated. It seems the alternatives aren't yet clear.  ""SegWit is such a clear and obvious win. I've yet to hear a downside argument to it,"" he told attendees.  He framed the issue as one of politics, not technology.  Growing optimism  There's no way to tell the future, but it's notable that when asked the same question, attendees seemed to take an optimistic view of the situation.  Osuntokun mentioned that Lightning has a backup plan if SegWit doesn’t activate. But, in the mean time, since SegWit offers a better network, they’re operating under the assumption that it will trigger.  ""If it's the best design, it makes sense to go toward that,"" he said.  Ametrano echoed the growing opinion that bitcoin is slow to change, and that that's actually a good thing.  ""I think it’s a win-win situation for bitcoin, because if SegWit is accepted, and I think it should be because it’s moving bitcoin’s technical boundary forward, this will improve bitcoin a lot. But if it is not approved, this will demonstrate that bitcoin cannot be manipulated or managed, not even by Bitcoin Core,"" he said.  Osuntokun was similarly positive in remarks, guessing that SegWit would activate in March.  When asked why, he shrugged and said only:  ""March feels right.”  Images via Cryptograffiti and Pete Rizzo",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/31/construct-2017-life-after-segwit-bitcoin-gridlock-takes-the-stage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2098ee21082c3549dc333fcce575e9bbdd205685-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427324,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QRh,1485875427,Bitcoin Price Breaks Sleepy Spell to Jump Above $950,"Bitcoin prices are up more than 3% since the start of the day’s trading, climbing above $950 for the first time in weeks.  The average price hit a high of $959.37 from an open of $920.24, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). BPI data shows that the price of bitcoin hasn’t exceed $950 since 6th January.  The rise above $950 came after several days of relatively stable trading, in which the price of bitcoin ranged between roughly $910 and $922, according to trading data.  At press time, the average price of bitcoin is $956.32.  CNY-denominated markets have climbed nearly 11%, hitting a press time high of ¥6,629.34. The current price of ¥6,608.70 represents a rise of roughly 10.7% above today’s UTC open of ¥5,961.77.  The move comes amid a shift in the global exchange landscape, which has seen its lines redrawn after major bourses in China moved to add trading fees.  As a result, volume has shifted – at least for now – toward no-fee markets. Observers, however, argue that this trend will be short-lived as those exchanges look to add fees of their own.

Dryja will now work full-time at the famed technical university's cryptocurrency and blockchain research effort – a division of its larger MIT Media Lab – where he will serve as a research scientist. (The MIT DCI also funds core bitcoin developers as part of a separate program under its management.)  In interview with CoinDesk, MIT DCI director of research Neha Narula credited the hiring to the caliber of Dryja's work, as well as his desire to focus further on research efforts.  Narula told CoinDesk:  ""When smart people become available, you ask them to work with you.""  Dryja is now working out of MIT's main office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he said he's active in educating undergraduates on digital currencies and fostering their interest in the technology.  The move also marks a change in direction for Dryja who had formerly served at one-time bitcoin exchange startup Mirror and as a founder of Lightning Labs, a for-profit startup seeking to develop the open-source Bitcoin Lightning Network.  Dryja indicated that business differences lead him to consider other avenues for his work, as did his belief that it's still too early to monetize many blockchain technology efforts.  ""There are places for for-profit things, but a lot of this is at the point where this is research. It's so early,"" he said.  Dryja said he is continuing to work on the Lightning Network, which has advanced since its 2015 proposal and is now being actively developed by a handful of global bitcoin startups and developer groups.  An early version of the technology, which would use the bitcoin network as a base for more robust transaction processing, debuted earlier this month.

42427333,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Qbh,1485864028,Chain Previews New Blockchain Privacy Tech 'Confidential Assets',"Blockchain startup Chain previewed forthcoming privacy tech for its Chain Protocol platform yesterday at CoinDesk's developer conference, Construct 2017.  Held at the Innovation Hangar in San Francisco, the event saw Chain chief product officer Devon Gundry and product architect Oleg Andreev showcase how the startup, backed by the venture arms of Capital One and Nasdaq, is navigating one of the biggest industry obstacles – building a distributed ledger that ensures data is revealed only to desired parties.  On stage, Andreev walked through a technology the startup terms 'Confidential Assets', which would effectively add additional data to transactions involving blockchain assets as a way to both mask information being sent to and from users and prove interactions between intended parties.  Andreev indicated that Chain is seeking to provide a solution for blockchain privacy that would protect information about accounts, account history and asset privacy.  Gundry told the audience:  ""The magic of the blockchain becomes possible if you publish transactions. So, how do you take privacy back? We needed to figure out a way to enforce the blockchain integrity by all the participants without compromising privacy.""  Andreev proceeded to walk attendees through an Alice and Bob-style transaction, in which $5 would go to Bob, and $5 would be returned to Alice.  With Confidential Assets, additional 'noise', or extraneous data, would be added to the transactions to hide information in blockchain implementations based on its technology.  Andreev posited that this data could then be parsed in traditional ways.  ""Using a key to derive the noise values, you can subtract it from the original commitment and find the value. Similarly, you can show this noise value with an auditor to show the proof of payment,"" he said.  In an example of how blockchain innovators are increasingly looking to other participants in an effort to further their technology, Andreev also detailed how Chain's technology differs from what is being implemented by blockchain networks like zcash and monero.  Andreev contends that, ultimately, Confidential Assets provides an approach that is more similar to monero, in that it obfuscates the issued and transferred amounts. Conversely, he framed zcash's technology as interesting, but unlikely to scale for enterprise needs.  Gundry indicated that Chain is working to develop this feature of its Chain Protocol with enterprise partners, though he declined to provide details.  ""We're working right now to bring this to production,"" he said.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Chain.

42427363,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QFh,1485860455,The FBI is Worried Criminals Might Use the Private Cryptocurrency Monero,"The privacy-focused digital currency monero has captured the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which has expressed concerns over its use among criminals.  Joseph Battaglia, a special agent working at the FBI’s Cyber Division in New York City, said during an event last week that widespread use of the increasingly popular cryptocurrency might impact the way the agency conducts investigations.  Addressing a group of about 150 law students at New York's Fordham University, he said:  ""There are obviously going to be issues if some of the more difficult to work with cryptocurrencies become popular. Monero is one that comes to mind, where its not very obvious what the transaction path is or what the actual value of the transaction is except to the end users.""  Launched in April 2014, monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency with enhanced privacy features. A fork of the Bytecoin codebase, monero leverages identity-obscuring ring signatures to make it unclear which funds have been sent by whom and to whom.  The cryptocurrency saw its price soar in 2016, climbing from about $0.50 at the beginning of the year to about $12, a 2,760% increase.  Since 2013, the agency has seen ""enormous growth"" in the number of cases involving digital currency payments, according to Battaglia. Of those, 75% involved bitcoin, he said, though he mentioned litecoin and monero as other cryptocurrencies the agency has encountered thus far.  The FBI Cyber Division looks into a diverse range of online criminal activity.  In 2015, the agency reported ransomware losses of $18m from a single type of software. Since at least last October, the agency has been investigating a $1.3m bitcoin theft tied to the hacking of the Bitfinex exchange.  'Nefarious uses'  Battaglia’s statements came after his ""high-level"" account of a typical cryptocurrency investigation given at the event, which one of a series of blockchain workshopshttps://www.fordham.edu/info/26538/fordham_ibm_blockchain_workshop co-hosted with IBM.  Other panelists included Brigid McDermott, vice president of blockchain business development at IBM; Dan Ramsden, a Fordham Business School adjunct professor; and Gregory Xethalis, a partner at law firm Kaye Scholer.  Following the event, the special agent said he couldn't provide additional details specifically pertaining to the FBI’s investigative techniques surrounding monero when asked by CoinDesk.  During the panel, however, Battaglia described the FBI as ""a reactionary organization"", adding that, instead of trying to predict the direction that cryptocurrency use might go, the agency has adopted a wait-and-see approach.  Battaglia concluded:  ""We’re going to look at what catches on, and what becomes mainstream, and then we’re going to keep an eye on that, because usually not long after that is when you start to see some of the fraud and some of the more nefarious uses of that technology.""

42427330,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1QXh,1485823573,The Battle For Bitcoin's Shifting Exchange Volumes is Escalating,"Bitcoin traders have long been skeptical of the reliability of available exchange data – but that uncertainty has been on the rise in recent days.  To recap, up until recently, China-based exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin dominated the landscape in terms of volume (though these figures were long observed with skepticism). However, this reign was cut short earlier in January when the startups came under the scrutiny of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank.  The result has been a series of policy changes, the abrupt end to popular trading features like margin trading and a rapid decline in the volume at the three exchanges, developments that are now impacting the wider market.  In recent days, new no-fee exchanges are now ranking among the top 10 in volume, resulting in a bitcoin exchange leaderboard that looks markedly different than it did last week.  At first, no-fee exchanges such as BTC100 and CHBTC moved to the front of the pack in terms of trading volume, but this, too, is now shifting.  As of today, BTC100, a no-fee exchange, held the top spot with roughly 32,600 BTC worth of trading volume during the 24 hours through roughly 22:00 UTC, CoinMarketCap data shows.  XBTCe and Poloniex, which both charge trading fees, held second and third place with more than 17,100 BTC and less than 17,100 BTC, respectively.  New opportunities  But while there is a fair amount of market confusion, what the takeaway might be is that the PBOC has effectively created new opportunities for smaller operations to compete by pushing for changes only for certain market participants.  Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, spoke to these recent developments, and drew a similar conclusion.  ""Since liquidity is king for exchanges, and liquidity begets liquidity, the decrease in trading volumes on Chinese exchanges has opened up the market for exchanges around the world to stake a claim as one of the most liquid exchanges in the world,"" he told CoinDesk.  Burniske further commented on how he expects some exchanges to take advantage of the situation by cutting prices. London-based Coinfloor, for example, is one such exchange that has already slashed fees since the PBOC's actions first began.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, offered a similar view on how marketplaces may respond to the situation.  ""Many exchanges may be using this as a marketing opportunity: by offering zero fees and pumping their volumes up, they appear at the top of the charts,"" he told CoinDesk.  Discussions ongoing  As of now, there are signs the exchanges themselves are aware of the current environment, signaling further updates could be ahead.  BTCTrade co-founder and CEO Zhang Shousong, for example, acknowledged that his China-based exchange has seen new volumes because it has yet to increase fees for users, though he said that he has been in talks with other major exchanges about its policies.  He said the exchange is considering following the lead of the other exchanges, in part, because their heightened volumes were what drew scrutiny from regulators.  ""We all want to reduce the heat of China's bitcoin trading,"" he said.  When asked if BTCTrade could move to alter its fees, Zhang told CoinDesk:  ""We are considering""  Medieval weaponry via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Charles Lloyd Bovaird II,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/31/the-battle-for-bitcoins-shifting-exchange-volumes-is-escalating,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04929ab098f0a9a18bb92e7aa7fe4d344adc3438-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
