I am skeptical about the robust view of its 2023 performance, but I am not pessimistic about its resilience. It has adequate assets to cover its operations. But it has to watch out for more outflows that may increase pressure on its reserves. Binance shows relative stability, but absolute strength and potential rebound are still unexciting. Binance Coin USD (BNB-USD) remains plagued with scrutiny and skepticism. After a massive market meltdown in 2022, multiple shocks shook digital asset foundations, including the stablecoin collapse and FTX (FTT-USD) fallout. It is no surprise BNB-USD is not spared from the negative impact. In addition, its recent controversy may erode its value to more mainstream investors. We can see it in outflows that continue despite the founder's reassurance. Nevertheless, its trading price is moving sideways after a series of rebounds recently. Also, BNB's Bitcoin (BTC-USD) balance remains more stable than its peers. As such, I don't consider it another FTX in the making. Right now, we must weigh its opportunities and risks this year. It continues to reign the market as a giant and capitalizes on the weakness of its competitors. Yes, its potential may not materialize soon, but hope still floats. As a market leader, it still has a competitive advantage over its peers. Binance 2023: A New High Or Just Hype? Since 2017, Binance has flourished, becoming the largest crypto exchange company. As a blockchain giant, it designed an environment solely for crypto-related functionalities. It has peaked in the last two years as more popular cryptocurrencies circulated. It has enjoyed an impeccable bull run, reaching all-time highs. But 2022 was a roller coaster ride as shocks and opportunities came simultaneously. The market meltdown became more evident as inflation and interest rate hikes intensified. These macroeconomic changes have reduced the appetite for cryptocurrencies. In turn, Binance's price took a nosedive. The price remains hammered, although it has shown a slight uptrend in the last month. Despite all these, Binance emerged as one of the biggest winners after the FTX collapse. From its less than 10% BTC market share in 2017-2018, it skyrocketed last year. Now, it holds over 20% of the Bitcoin supply on crypto exchanges. Also, it has massive control of the spot and derivatives market volume. However, Binance seems to cling to relative performance rather than absolute strength. I find it wise, though, as the market remains hammered. Its absolute strength and rebound potential this year remains to be seen. As such, it has to prove its capacity to sustain itself with all the risks it faces. Moreover, Bitcoin outflows shocked the market, amounting to $3 billion in 24 hours. Recent data shows a continuation of losses. Despite the efforts to regain value, the outcome remains unfavorable. The BTC downtrend reduces capital inflows and BNB market value. From about 595,864 BTC balance, it now only has 512,759 , a 14% drop in less than a month. Thankfully, its percentage to total BTC trading volume remains at over 3%. Meanwhile, the multichain token value had 4.5 million net outflows last week. Its market share in token allocation is now 24% from 28% in December. Bitcoin Balance (Coinglass) Token Allocation (nanssenportfolio) Binance Token Flow (Nansen) On a lighter note, Binance sustains its relative stability and power. It appears more secure, unlike FTX , which showed excessive price and balance drops before its bankruptcy. Also, BTC outflows on Binance are more manageable than most of its close peers. Its current monthly decrease rate is only 0.9% compared to the peer average of 3.4%. We can also see how it swiftly took the lead from Coinbase (COIN). Its overall token outflows are more controlled than the rest. Although outflows persist, Binance's price moves sideways after a sharp uptrend recently. It may offer a potential opportunity and entry point to buy Binance coins. It continues to reign the market with its increasing volume share . But right now, it depends on relative performance rather than absolute durability. Put simply, its peers mess up more than it does. Meanwhile, external factors may have mixed impacts that may offset each other. I will discuss them one by one in the next section. Binance Coin maintains a solid market standing, but investors must be careful before buying. Bitcoin Balances On Exchanges (Data from Glassnode, Chart Created by the Author) Monthly Volume Share (Coindesk) Economy The crypto market may remain hammered this year. Outflows may increase as recessionary headwinds remain bothersome. Fortunately, there is now a continued inflation lull . Interest rate hikes may persist, but increments may be lower than anticipated. We can see the pattern between inflation and BNB's price. As inflation peaked, the price dropped. In the subsequent months, BNB's price increased again as inflation started to lull. But it did not bounce back to its previous highs. We may attribute it to the impact of interest rate hikes. In essence, interest rate hikes require people to increase their liquidity. It is no wonder investors tend to withdraw or shift to more liquid assets. It is one of the reasons I don't expect a sharp rebound this year. Interest rates must stabilize first before BNB can sustain its rebound. It is not easy to observe the price trend, but the historical changes show an inverse relationship. And even if it has not regained its value yet, BNB price appears more stable as the inflation lull continues. In the following years, I expect a more manageable economy. It is feasible for me since labor market conditions are still a far cry from the Great Recession. Purchasing power and business stability may improve as inflation keeps decreasing. In turn, the Fed may start to lower interest rates. With that, I also anticipate BNB's sustained rebound. Portfolio diversification may increase, and crypto inflows may resume. BNB rebound may take more time and effort, but it may be fruitful. As such, we must determine if BNB can withstand macroeconomic headwinds. Does BNB-USD have adequate capacity to sustain itself amidst capital outflows? Investors must determine how long it can last. We must consider its current performance and assets. US Inflation Rate (Trading Economics) BNB Price (Seeking Alpha) Inflation Rate, Interest Rate, And Mortgage Rate (Author Estimation) Investigation The money laundering investigation by the DOJ also puts downward pressure on Binance. The investigation started in 2018 , and several federal prosecutors believe in the substance of the evidence . But until now, they remain split over filing criminal charges against the executives, including the founder . It may become costly for Binance, especially now the market remains down. It can also contribute to the continued crypto outflows in the exchange. More coins are at stake, so it must maintain liquidity to cover all potential capital outflows and legal expenses. Financial Positioning Before the year ended, Binance had nearly $70 billion in digital assets. It shows an adequate capacity to sustain its operations despite market disruptions. However, Binance already bled a considerable portion of assets about two months after its November peak. If we estimate all the outflows and value reductions in the last two months, it has already lost about $15-20 billion. These may comprise about $10-15 billion in foregone assets and BTC and other coin outflows. Most of these reductions occurred after its transparency release. Hence, it is safe to assume that it now has $52-54 billion in assets after the outflows and price changes. Other analysts are more pessimistic, as their average estimates amount to nearly $50 billion . This aspect must work hand-in-hand with the first two aspects that may affect Binance. It may hint at its sustainability amidst investigations should outflows continue. Despite this, it has adequate means to cover its trading volume and prices. It has $44 billion in market capitalization. The margin is still about 12-20%. BNB shows sustainability, but investors must take extra precautions before buying. Binance Assets (Forbes) Price Assessment We have already assessed BNB using the impact of macroeconomic indicators. While doing so cannot guarantee the right assessment, the historical pattern appears logical. We can also see that many other factors contribute to its fluctuations aside from the above-mentioned aspects. In this part, we will look into the price change itself. After its continued decline last month, BNB's price had a notable rebound recently. It has already risen above the set resistance level of $250. Now, it appears to be the new support level, which can confirm and entice new trader entries. Binance Price (Chart From TradingView, Analyzed by the Author) As it expands again, potential buyers can wait for a dip within $250-255. For the bullish pattern to continue, I set the new support level at $245-246. We can set a new resistance of $295-300. But we must be more careful since dips below our support level can convey a bull trap. It can also serve as a confirmation of the bearish pattern three weeks ago. If true, sellers can set a base at $220-225, which may serve as a new low level. Bottom line Binance Coin USD can be a huge rebound-drop mix this year. It faces headwinds, which may intensify this year. Even so, its market standing stays solid, allowing it to capitalize on size and popularity. Potential growth avenues should not be discounted, although the risks still offset them. Of course, one may not expect these things to materialize anytime soon. Mixed market conditions may offset each other's impact. The new price pattern of each Binance coin remains to be seen, so interested buyers may have to wait for a better entry point. The recommendation, for now, is that Binance Coin USD is a hold.",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569357-binance-giant-trying-to-regain-footing-in-off-balance-market?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7420444.jpeg

Coinbase’s rating was lowered from BB, which indicates major ongoing uncertainties to adverse business, financial and economic conditions, to BB-, a further step away from investment grade. Both ratings are considered junk bonds.  Coinbase is one of two crypto-related junk bond issuers, along with MicroStrategy (MSTR). Coinbase shares were flat in after-hours trading Wednesday.  The ratings agency said weakened trading volumes in the aftermath of FTX’s collapse and pressure on Coinbase’s profitability, as well as regulatory risks, were the main reasons for the downgrade.  “We believe FTX’s bankruptcy in November has severely hit the crypto industry’s perceived credibility, causing a lack of retail engagement,” S&P wrote. “As a result, trading volumes across exchanges, including Coinbase, have declined sharply.”  Coinbase earns most of its revenue from retail trading fees, and trading volume has dropped even more sharply in recent weeks. As a result, S&P expects the U.S.-based exchange’s profitability to “remain pressured” in 2023, saying the company could “post very small positive S&P Global adjusted EBITDA,” or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, this year.  Coinbase’s third-quarter revenue in 2022 was down 44% compared to the second quarter, which was driven by lower trading volume, the company said in November.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/11/coinbase-junk-bonds-further-downgraded-by-sp-on-weak-profitability-regulatory-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5557be15675f6ea49ef215f105966279668e4316-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Like many things in financial markets, we’ll likely find a bit of both. At stake is whether bitcoin's mini-rally this week above $17,000 is sustainable.  An initial area of potential concern is a recent downturn in new bitcoin addresses. Data from Glassnode shows that higher prices for BTC tend to result in more bitcoin wallets as interest increases, and vice versa.  What may be concerning is the decline in addresses in November while BTC traded relatively flat. This could signal a couple of things:  Markets at the time didn’t yet think bitcoin prices had reached a bottom.

The cryptocurrency changed hands at $14.41 at 4:16 p.m. ET, the highest level seen since Nov. 9, just two days before crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) filed for bankruptcy and subsequently roiled the market.

42388256,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRAbmB,1673471382,El Salvador Passes Law Paving the Way for 'Volcano Bond',"The Legislative Assembly of El Salvador approved on Wednesday a law for the issuance of digital assets other than bitcoin. Included in the legislation was a legal framework for the issuance of a bitcoin-backed bond, also known as the Volcano Bond.  In November 2021, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced that the Central American country – which earlier that year established bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender – was planning to raise $1 billion via bitcoin-backed bonds. The proposed paper soon became known as Volcano Bonds as the money was to go towards – among other things – seeding a bitcoin mining industry reliant solely on renewable energy, including that generated by the country's active volcanos.  Although initially planned for March 2022, the bond issuance had to be postponed several times, mostly due to last year's brutal bitcoin bear market. The digital assets bill was finally introduced in the Legislative Assembly at the end of November 2022, where Bukele's party, Nuevas Ideas, has a large majority. Sixty-two legislators voted for the law today, and 16 voted against.  In a statement released Wednesday, Bitfinex stated that it “will be an infrastructure provider for what it says should really be termed the ""Volcano Token"" – ""a digital token which would help El Salvador to raise capital to pay down its sovereign debt, direct funds towards the creation of Bitcoin mining infrastructure, and fund the construction of 'Bitcoin City'.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/11/el-salvador-passes-law-paving-the-way-for-volcano-bonds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3837d5404c99cd8472e8816cf027d8b9079b3c4a-2500x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388237,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRAcNb,1673471317,"As Crypto Crashes, Coinbase Bets Big on Europe","Coinbase wants potential customers in Europe to give it a warm reception as crypto winter chills trading activity in its home market. But expanding into Europe may not be enough to reverse the company’s fortunes.  On Tuesday morning, the publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange slashed 20% of its workforce, shuttering most of its Japan operations. The layoffs are yet another distress flare from one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, which was previously forced to cut 18% of its employees in June to refocus its resources on fighting a series of headwinds.  Coinbase wasn't always struggling, however.  At the end of 2021, Coinbase was flying high on crypto's mainstream moment. Investors who had never bought a bond or invested in the stock market flocked to the crypto exchange to trade buzzy tokens like dogecoin, bitcoin and ether.  The deluge of customers helped Coinbase rack up record revenue and profits in 2021. Revenue soared to $7.8 billion. The platform's monthly active users grew 300% that same year.  But a major stablecoin crash roiled crypto markets in May, plunging the price of bitcoin to a new two-year low and prompting investors to withdraw their funds from centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase — a drop that grew steeper in the wake of competitor FTX’s implosion in November.  Traders’ exodus from the market has presented a major existential threat to Coinbase, which collects roughly 90% of its revenue from trading fees. Without a steady stream of new users, the company may not survive.  Its saving grace, the company hopes, lies in Europe, where the European Union is preparing to pass the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) Regulation, a common framework intended to regulate crypto trading across the European bloc’s 27 member states. There, Coinbase hopes to find new traders to sustain its largely user-dependent revenue model.  Coinbase began expanding into markets in Italy, Spain, France, The Netherlands and, outside the EU, Switzerland last year ahead of MiCA’s likely passing and implementation. Coinbase hopes a stricter regulatory environment in Europe will give it an advantage over its privately held competitors and facilitate its plan to capture greater market share.  ""It's almost like an existential priority for us to make sure that we are able to realize our mission by accelerating our expansion efforts,"" Nana Murugesan, vice president of international and business development at Coinbase, told Bloomberg in September.  Murugesan is steering the company’s foray into Europe, assisted by five regional directors who are overseeing operations in each new market.  Coinbase will likely confront stumbling blocks in its bid to capture greater market share across the EU, however.  That’s because the regulatory shift Coinbase is banking on may not impose strict enough guidelines to curb competing exchanges’ activities in the region. Coinbase faces major competition from rivals including Binance and Crypto.com, which have leveraged their competitive fees and specialized trading services to establish strong footholds in Europe. As Coinbase contends with declining revenue and a plummeting share price, the company may have to muster the resources to build out its fledgling derivatives trading service, which poses greater regulatory risks than other forms of trading, and spearhead other initiatives that will woo European customers.  The success of Coinbase’s current revenue model lives or dies by the exchange’s ability to charge a steady stream of new traders high fees to process crypto transactions. But it's those traders who are among the first to exit the market during a protracted market downturn, says Lisa Ellis, a senior equity analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC.  “When prices are low and you're in a crypto winter, a lot of those [beginner] retail investors kind of go into hibernation,” said Ellis.  Coinbase's revenue for 2022 is expected to drop by roughly $3.2 billion, or 59% from the year prior, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. The company expects revenue in 2023 to decline year over year and losses of as much as $500 million before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation.  Coinbase’s sliding revenue and earnings have sagged as the company’s user base dwindles. During the third quarter of 2022, Coinbase reported 8.5 million monthly active users, down from 9.2 million in the first quarter. Perhaps more important, those who remain on the platform are trading less.  ""Since the onset of the crypto winter earlier this year, trading volumes have been shifting offshore to Europe in a material way,” said Ellis.  Monthly trading volumes declined more than 50% from January to September 2022 in the U.S. compared to just 18% across the global monthly crypto spot market during the same time period, according to a letter Coinbase shared with its shareholders late last fall.  Those higher trading volumes abroad, along with the sheer size and population of the European Union, enticed Coinbase to make a play for European markets, says Daniel Seifert, vice president and regional managing director of Coinbase’s EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa] division.  “One thing that's important to realize is that with eight billion people on this planet, only about 300 million are in the United States,” Seifert told CoinDesk. “We want to make sure that we're winning in EMEA, because we think that it has a lighthouse character globally.”  The EU’s tentative approval of MiCA regulations also makes the region ripe for Coinbase to plant its roots across the EU, said Seifert. The regulations, if given the final go-ahead by lawmakers in February, should go into effect in early 2024.  “As publicly listed companies we already have and have had for a very long time, a very, very high level of transparency,” said Seifert. “Having independent auditors who regularly, every quarter, look at our financial statements, our accounts … is probably one of the strongest things in terms of [securing regulatory] approval that you can have.”  Rivals and regulations  But the road ahead is not without challenges, and Coinbase isn’t the only exchange revving up to increase its market share across the EU.  Binance and Crypto.com, Europe’s two largest exchanges by daily trading volumes, are already serving users in Coinbase's target markets, where they have sometimes operated without licenses.  Now, both exchanges are working to secure regulatory licenses, or at least tentative approvals, in those markets and beyond. This week, Binance received the green light from Swedish regulators, clinching its seventh regulatory approval in the EU.  However, publicly owned Coinbase may come out on top in European markets when the privately run Binance, Crypto.com and others battle to quash media scrutiny of their opaque corporate structures and financials and their reputations for flouting regulations in years past, said Ellis.  “The fact that [Coinbase] operates within the boundary of regulations all the time is a major thing that differentiates Coinbase from its competitors, [and] that should help them bubble up to the top,” said Ellis.  That’s especially true in the wake of November’s FTX collapse, which increased regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges and increased traders' anxieties about the assets that back those exchanges.  But it remains uncertain whether Coinbase's friendlier relationship with regulators is enough to sway European customers to park their assets on the company's platform. Binance charges a trading fee of 0.10% for most transactions, while Coinbase charges a flat fee, ranging from 99 cents to $2.99 for transactions up to $200, and a percentage-based fee of up to 3.99% for transactions above $200.  Those higher fees may discourage new customers from migrating to the exchange as high inflation continues to take a big bite out of Europeans’ paychecks.  Binance also operates a derivatives trading business, a service Coinbase does not offer in Europe, which could put Coinbase at a disadvantage. Derivatives trading now accounts for more than 60% of all crypto trading transactions, according to data provider CryptoCompare, which could continue to grow during the market downturn.  Still, the EU’s new crypto regulations may allow regulators to crack down on crypto derivatives trading in Europe, leveling the playing field for Coinbase. MiCA gives individual national regulators the power to forbid crypto products they deem risky and there is some evidence major countries would seek to deploy it against retail use of derivatives.  “Derivatives based on crypto-assets are one key area where such inconsistency can occur [under MiCA],” wrote the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), a non-profit advocacy group for blockchain technologies, in a note to European regulators last year. “In cases where a derivative product references underlying assets which are settled in crypto-assets rather than in fiat currency, it is unclear whether the instrument would be a financial instrument or a crypto-asset across all EU member states.”  Coinbase also trails its competitors in terms of its advertisement spending in the region, meaning it will have to spend more to catch up with its rivals and capture market share. In 2021, Crypto.com spent roughly $2.5 million on advertising in the U.K., while Coinbase spent just 5% of that, according to market intelligence company Sensor Tower. Coinbase declined to disclose how much it would spend on advertising for its latest Europe push, but regulations on crypto advertising make it difficult to plan advertising campaigns in some European markets like the U.K., which is not part of the EU.  Still, some traders doubt Coinbase will be able to allocate the necessary resources to support its European expansion as crypto winter takes a big bite out of the company's profit margins, says Chris Brendler, a senior equity analyst at D.A. Davidson Companies.  “There are a lot of folks with this view that crypto [trading] volumes are crashing, and [those volumes] are 90% of Coinbase’s revenue, and they've got this massive expense base,” said Brendler. “There’s worries about not only the company's earnings, but its financial health too.”  Coinbase stock plunged roughly 86% in 2022, compared to a 19% drop in the S&P 500 during the same period. The stock now trades at $43, up from its all-time low of $31.55 last week. Coinbase reported a per-share loss of $2.43 in the third quarter of 2022, signaling the company is down after a profitable first year as a public company in 2021.  Success with stablecoins  But although things look uncertain on Wall Street, there is one bright spot for the exchange. Coinbase’s partnership with stablecoin issuer Circle may allow the exchange to bolster its revenue amid a sagging market. Investors’ interest in stablecoins, which are pegged one-to-one to the U.S. dollar or another asset and designed to maintain a relatively stable price, has soared thanks to falling cryptocurrency prices and increased market volatility in recent months.  Coinbase’s stablecoin offering will enable the company to accrue more revenue through the net interest income yielded by the short-term Treasurys that back the Circle-issued USD coin, which may help the exchange raise the necessary capital to put some funds behind its Europe push.  At the same time,Coinbase is pushing for global adoption of USDC by removing barriers to entry, such as waiving fiat-to-USDC conversion fees.  In Italy, as in other parts of Europe, the partnership may be particularly profitable.  Marco Gallazi, a crypto trader from Italy who runs the crypto investing blog ""Mind the Chart,"" says Europeans prefer stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar over those pegged to the euro, so Coinbase's zero-fee USDC incentive is likely to attract some Italians to the platform.  ""We do not use the euro as a base currency but prefer pegged stablecoins at the value of the dollar, '' Gallazi told CoinDesk. ""You have less liquidity in euros and it is more complex to determine the movements.""  European crypto investors have mostly shied away from euro-denominated stablecoins, which account for only 0.2% of trading volumes, according to a European Central Bank report.  A provision in the current version of MiCA, however, could impose limits on the issuance of USD-backed stablecoins, crimping Coinbase’s opportunity to capitalize on its Circle partnership and zero-fee stablecoin incentive.  But, Coinbase is prepared to deal with any last-minute amendments to the regulatory framework and will adjust its strategy accordingly, said Seifert.  “[Our teams] are going through the [draft legislation] that we have at the moment and are parsing all of that and kind of going literally line by line and seeing what kind of changes we would have to make [to be in compliance],” said Seifert.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/11/as-crypto-crashes-coinbase-bets-big-on-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/beebb7d49f8b6ed0cc958a0b1aca66fa18042d24-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393877,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb1dT,1673470791,Crypto Markets Analysis: Is Bitcoin Heating Up? Looking at On-Chain Data for Clues,"In Tuesday’s column we looked at technical analysis highlighting signs of increasing volatility in crypto markets. Thursday’s conversation will likely deal, at least in part, with the release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for December, as investors seek clues on the outlook for Federal Reserve monetary policy based on the latest inflation reading.  On Wednesday we are looking at a few pieces of on-chain data for signs of hope or concern on the bitcoin (BTC) market. Like many things in financial markets, we’ll likely find a bit of both.  At stake is whether bitcoin's mini-rally this week above $17,000 is sustainable.  An initial area of potential concern is a recent downturn in new bitcoin addresses. Data from Glassnode shows that higher prices for BTC tend to result in more bitcoin wallets as interest increases, and vice versa.  What may be concerning is the decline in addresses in November while BTC traded relatively flat. This could signal a couple of things:  Markets at the time didn’t yet think bitcoin prices had reached a bottom.  Whether BTC had bottomed or not, investors felt better opportunities existed elsewhere.  What ultimately may be more useful is to examine when the number of new addresses starts to move higher again. Optimism seemed to appear in August, when the number of addresses began to increase with BTC at $22,000. The pivot downward appears in November, shortly after the FTX fallout began.  Bitcoin transfer volumes  Declines in transfer volumes on the Bitcoin network also warrant concern, particularly related to institutional investment in crypto assets.  Higher aggregate amounts of BTC being transferred implies that larger investors are purchasing bitcoin. Between August and now, the total amount of BTC transferred declined from $48 billion to $5 billion, implying that large investors have slowed participation substantially.  Part of this is certainly a byproduct of declining prices, but the 90% decline in transfer volumes significantly exceeds the 23% decline in price since August.  Transfer volume by size also implies that larger players are on the sidelines, with transactions in excess of $1 million falling from 68% of daily activity in August to 45% of daily activity currently.  The recent increase in prices certainly provides short-term gains for bullish investors.  Ultimately, the verdict is still out on what bitcoin does next.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/11/crypto-markets-analysis-is-bitcoin-heating-up-looking-at-on-chain-data-for-clues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fe72f76ab7de95666e2906d69434c274415fab1-3024x4032.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s a sign that the scandals and enormous investment losses have taken a toll and suggests that for crypto to reach mainstream adoption, much more work is needed.  “There's a general desire by companies to distance themselves from the crypto bubble of the last couple years,” D.A. Davidson analyst Chris Brendler said. “It makes it easier when you're dealing with more traditional-finance institutions.”  Read more: SEC Charges 3 for Insider Trading Over Long Island Iced Tea's Blockchain 'Pivot'  The crypto name issue is particularly acute for crypto miners because they need lots of capital and thus must appeal to outside investors. Some of them have ditched “blockchain” from their names. For instance, last week, Riot Blockchain Inc., which is one of the biggest publicly traded bitcoin-mining firms, changed its name to Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) and referred to itself as an “increasingly diversified business.” Its stock had tumbled 75% in 2022.  Applied Blockchain Inc., a miner and data-center operator, became Applied Digital Corp. (APLD) in November. “The company’s refreshed name more accurately reflects its mission, services and broader business offerings to serve customers that require large amounts of computing power for applications,” it said in a statement. Its stock plummeted 92% last year.  It’s not just miners expressing dissatisfaction with crypto terminology. This week, the head of one of the largest crypto trading firms in the world, Jump Crypto, tweeted about the potential need to step away from some key terms.  “The words cryptocurrency and smart contracts have set the industry back a fair bit,” Kanav Kariya, Jump Crypto’s president, tweeted. “How do we coalesce around new terms that explain to folks that most tokens aren't intended to be currencies and that on-chain programs/apps aren't intended to be legal contracts?”  At CES 2023, a tech trade show in Las Vegas held this month, panelists at different sessions showed enthusiasm for the potential of the metaverse, but were not so enthused about industry terms.  Brian Weiner, CEO of entertainment industry ad and marketing firm The Illusion Factory, said he was stepping away from the term “NFT” and using “digital collectibles” instead because of the negativity associated with NFTs. The idea, he said during his appearance at a panel whose description had included the term “NFTs,” was to “dejargonize” the technology and focus on the experience rather than on how it works.  During another CES panel, called “Metaverse Media Leadership,” Ted Shilowitz, futurist for Paramount Global, said that while he was “very pro and very bullish on Web3, blockchain underpinnings,” he was very “negative about the terminology of the metaverse,” going so far to claim that the inventor of the term, Neal Stephenson, “will agree [that] the terminology has replaced the reality of what’s going on.”  Toby Bochan contributed reporting to this story.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Aoyon Ashraf, Eliza Gkritsi",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/11/crypto-terms-become-dirty-words-as-bear-market-lingers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a412933474e09c6ea065f652890039ccf29193e7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With this partnership with AWS, Ava Labs can help customers deploy custom offerings linked to over 100,000 partners spread across 150 countries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Currently More Stable Than Gold, DXY, Nasdaq, Here’s What Could Happen Next Technically, the Avalanche node operators can operate in AWS GovCloud for the FedRAMP compliance use case, which is an essential pre-requisite for many enterprises and governments. This partnership will help scale blockchain adoption among many enterprises, government organizations, and other institutions. Howard Wright, the VP and Global Head of startups at AWS, stated: Looking forward, web3 and blockchain are inevitable. No one can call the time or date or quarter that it’s going to happen and it’ll be mainstream, but we’ve seen the cycles of growth before. The velocity of this one seems like it’s accelerating and we’re just excited to be a part of this. Through the partnership, individuals will find it much easier to launch and manage nodes on Avalanche; additionally, it will strengthen and make the network more flexible for developers to work on. This new development has positively affected the altcoin’s price, but it is yet to be seen if the coin can sustain this price sentiment. Avalanche Technical Analysis The news of AWS being incorporated into the Avalanche ecosystem has instantly spiked investor interest. The daily chart of AVAX displays a 6.6% gain, which can be termed a rally. This has made the coin break past the $13.60 resistance level, and now AVAX is valued at $14.40. It is yet to be seen if the coin manages to breach the $15 mark, acting as a resistance mark for the coin. A fall from the current price will bring the altcoin down to $13.70. The Relative Strength Index was overbought, which means the asset was overvalued. The overvalued condition can be attributed to the newest development. Usually, once the asset is overbought, the price corrects itself. Due to bullish sentiment, AVAX shot past the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), indicating that buyers have been driving the price momentum in the market. Not just the 20-SMA, the altcoin was parked above the 50-SMA due to excessive demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests price momentum and a trend reversal. The indicator formed a few green histograms, which are buy signals for the coin. The most recent histogram increased in size, anticipating the rise in the price of the asset. Investors could quickly take this as a signal for entry as the price would increase over the next few trading sessions before it started to retrace.

Over the last 24 hours, the coin slipped 2%, indicating that it could not sustain its weekly gains. Following a significant price increase, the technical outlook indicates that the altcoin’s price will trend lower. This correction might continue over the subsequent trading sessions; however, the ADA daily chart has pointed towards a bullish pattern. This translates to the reading that ADA could attempt to rise on its chart after a brief retracement. Related Reading: Will Solana Price Continue To Surge After The Explosive Price Rally? As Bitcoin continues to post appreciation in the last 24 hours, many altcoins are attempting to rise on their charts, but some altcoins are also struggling under their crucial resistance levels. The accumulation of Cardano took a dip on the daily chart, indicating a fall in demand for the altcoin. This fall in demand is a result of the Cardano price correcting itself. Despite a fall in demand, buyers continued to have the upper hand. The market capitalization of Cardano increased, indicating that the bulls were still around. For Cardano to stop its downward movement, the coin has to sustain itself above the $0.28 price line. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ADA was trading at $0.30 at press time. The coin recently fell from the $0.31 mark due to the daily loss on its chart. Overhead resistance for the Cardano price was at $0.33; a move above will help ADA recover significantly. On the other hand, ADA has to remain above the immediate support level of $0.28. Failing to stay above the $0.28 mark will drag the altcoin down to $0.24. ADA might trade close to $0.28 before it starts to recover. The altcoin displayed the cup and handle pattern, which is considered to be a bullish price pattern. In this pattern, the asset descends slightly before moving north. The amount of Cardano traded in the last session was green, pointing towards more buyers. Technical Analysis The technical outlook for ADA remained bullish, with buying strength declining slightly. Cardano’s price was no longer overbought, but buyers still exceeded sellers in the market. The Relative Strength Index recorded a multi-month high. The indicator was above 60 despite the downtick, meaning buying strength was greater than selling. On that same note, the ADA price shot past the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), suggesting that buyers were driving the price momentum. Cardano was also above the 50-SMA line as the bulls were still around. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence that tells the price momentum and reversals was bullish with green signal bars.

The investigation follows CoinDesk’s August report that the Macalinao brothers used a web of 11 pseudonymous identities to build an ecosystem of interlocking financial products that double- and triple-counted crypto deposits by passing tokens between themselves. Their effort boosted a key growth metric for Solana by billions of dollars during the height of crypto’s 2021 bull market, and, according to Ian, juiced the price of SOL, the native token of the Solana network.  “The metric to optimize for in Summer 2021 was [total value locked (TVL)],” Ian wrote in a never-published blog post obtained by CoinDesk. “TVL can only count if protocols are built separately, so I devised a scheme to maximize Solana’s TVL: I would build protocols that stack on top of each other, such that a dollar could be counted several times.”  Investigators are seeking information on the web of crypto projects that orbited Saber, one of the people said. That includes decentralized-finance (DeFi) yield-farming app Sunny Aggregator as well as Cashio, a stablecoin project that lost millions of dollars in a March hack. Ian secretly wrote the code for both projects using pseudonymous identities.  “If an ecosystem is all built by a few people, it does not look as authentic,” Ian wrote. “I wanted to make it look like a lot of people were building on our protocol rather than ship 20+ disjoint [sic] programs as one person.”  The Macalinao brothers and the Justice Department didn't respond to requests for comment.  Read more: Master of Anons: How a Crypto Developer Faked a DeFi Ecosystem  CoinDesk’s report on the brothers’ gamification of their projects’ TVL prompted industry stats service DefiLlama to change how it presents the popular metric.  In the wake of CoinDesk’s report the Macalinao brothers scuttled their plans to move Saber to the Aptos blockchain. They exited their crypto venture-capital firm, Protagonist VC. And they transferred control over some of their pseudonymously built projects to Marinade, another Solana-based DeFi protocol.  Saber, the stablecoin exchange and keystone of the brothers’ DeFi ecosystem, continues to operate: Its website reported handling $4.4 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours at press time. Ian has worked to maintain that project’s infrastructure, though Saber’s Discord server, where users can go to ask questions and get updates, is largely abandoned.

7412707,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569304-coinbase-job-cuts-ignite-bulls?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1673466396,Coinbase: Job Cuts Ignite The Bulls,"Summary Coinbase has been mired in a horrendous bear market. Recent job cuts appear to have spurred the bulls to see a bottom in the stock. Time will tell, but Coinbase is putting in all the signs of a sustainable bottom. Earlier this month, I penned a piece on crypto marketplace Coinbase ( COIN ), where I said we had signs of a tradable bottom. The stock has been obliterated since the peak just over a year ago, and for good reason. However, even beaten down stocks eventually find their footing, and I thought we might have something with Coinbase with the setup that was in place. Shares are up 18.5% since then, with some help from job cuts that amount to a quarter of the company’s workforce, which is significant to say the least. That round of job cuts, along with a chart that now looks quite different, means Coinbase is worth a fresh look to see if the long trade has now run its course, or if we’re in the early innings of another bull move. Possible short squeeze? Anyone that has read my work knows that I think the term “short squeeze” gets thrown around all too often. You need a truly perfect setup for a short squeeze to actually take place, and most heavily-shorted stocks never see anything like a squeeze. In fact, despite the fact that we hear about short squeezes often in the media, they’re actually quite rare. Indeed, heavily-shorted stocks are usually heavily-shorted for very good reasons. But sometimes, there are conditions that are ripe for a squeeze, and I’ll say that with Coinbase rallying strongly on heavy volume, I wouldn’t rule it out here. Now, before we look at the chart, I am not suggesting a short squeeze is incoming on Coinbase. I’m simply pointing out that the conditions are coming together that could result in such an event, and I’ll explain below. Never, ever buy a stock because a short squeeze is possible. Like I said, squeezes are exceedingly rare and most of the time, possible short squeezes just fizzle out into more losses for longs. Enough of the disclaimers; let’s get into the chart. StockCharts This is the same chart I posted earlier this month, with the buy setup noted on the PPO and the positive divergence it provided. You can read about the prior trade setup in the linked article, so I won’t go through it again. The changes since that trade was setup are significant, so let’s instead focus there. First, the PPO is confirming this bullish move and is making a multi-month high. We’re still well below the centerline on the PPO, so there is much work to do for the bulls, but this is a very strong sign that the double bottom put in at $31 is looking more and more sustainable. Second, the accumulation/distribution line has turned sharply higher, as the rally we’ve seen has been improving throughout the trading day, and on good volume. Those things are signs of accumulation, hence the rising A/D line. Third, the 14-day RSI has cleared the centerline for the first time since October, which again is a significantly bullish sign. Stocks mired in downtrends tend to struggle to get their 14-day RSIs ahead of 60 on the 14-day RSI, and Coinbase finished yesterday with that metric at 56. Will it clear 60? If it does, that’s a great sign for the bulls. Fourth, the 5-day RSI, which is a very short-term indicator, is in overbought territory for the first time since October. Again, stocks mired in downtrends tend to see this value remain well below overbought territory, so this is a positive sign for bulls. I’ll note the 10-day rate of change in the bottom panel shows +21%, which is extended to say the least. The stock was up more than 12% just yesterday, so that’s no surprise. But based upon the indicators we’ve looked at, Coinbase’s move looks a bit overextended in the very short-term. With all of that in mind, let’s take a look at short squeeze potential. In order to get a short squeeze, you need a stock that is heavily-shorted, clears key resistance levels, and is trading with high volume on that breakout of resistance. Coinbase is heavily-shorted, at 24%, so we can check that box. Volume has been pretty good on this January rally, so while we cannot say it’s reaching squeeze levels, the pieces are in place. Finally, and most critically, it has to clear key resistance. In a short squeeze situation, the level that needs clearing is where the majority of shorts will start losing money. While we cannot know exactly where and when all shorts entered their positions, we can make an educated guess based upon the chart. In my view, the declining 50-day simple moving average and the $46 level as noted on the chart above would signify a significant breakout to the upside that could send the shorts scrambling. I’ll say again there is never any guarantee a short squeeze will occur. However, I will say Coinbase has the pieces in place for such an event, if it can continue to rally. Given the short-term overbought nature of the stock, my base case is that we see a rejection of the 50-day simple moving average, and a subsequent 20-day exponential moving average test, currently $38, but rising. We’ll see what happens, but it is my view that Coinbase is setup quite well for the bulls here, I just don't think it's going to continue higher indefinitely without some sort of breather. Job cuts are a necessary evil We’ve seen countless companies, particularly in tech industries, cut jobs in the past several months. Nobody wants to see people lose their jobs, and there is a real and significant cost to the impacted individuals. However, the fact remains that companies tend to hire too many people during good times, and then have to cut the excess when business slows down. Coinbase certainly appears to have been guilty of hiring sprees that were unsustainable, but the recent round of job cuts makes it appear the company has taken a hard look at its priorities, and that’s a good thing. Coinbase is reducing staff by 25%, or just under a thousand people. It’s been obvious for some time that the crypto boom of 2021 ended a while ago and that sees retail trader interest in crypto fall off a cliff. That cliff was – and still is – unkind to Coinbase, and it is finally rightsizing for the market conditions it finds itself in. The cuts won’t impact 2022 results, but the company expects some efficiencies to be gained with the job eliminations. It’s taking ~$150 million in restructuring charges, which include cash severance and benefits payments, as well as stock-based compensation that is being vested on an accelerated basis for the impacted employees. These charges will hit Q1 results, so expect a real stinker when the company reports those results in a few months. On the plus side, this will result in a 25% reduction of SG&A costs, which has averaged $544 million per quarter over the last 12 months . We’re therefore looking at very significant savings, particularly on stock-based compensation, going forward. That’s a welcomed development as Coinbase’s operating income was -$470 million last quarter. Headcount reductions will significantly lower the bar for if/when the company can see revenue rebound in terms of getting back to breakeven, and eventually, profitability. In addition, the company said it was shutting several projects that had low chances of success, which is good not only in a tangible sense of saving those dollars, but also in that the company is taking a hard look at where and how it’s spending. I mentioned companies tend to get carried away during good times, and this suggests Coinbase was guilty of that. However, Coinbase is putting that right and that’s a good thing. In short, I never want to see companies cutting jobs because there are real human beings being impacted very negatively. However, it’s a part of the business cycle and in this case, it’s probably long overdue. Coinbase is rightsizing, and that’s a very good thing for those bullish on the stock. Other considerations We all know crypto trading volume has fallen off a cliff in the past year, and that’s because retail traders of crypto tend to get very involved during bull runs, and then disappear during bear markets. However, this bear market in crypto is looking fairly long in the tooth, and Coinbase is still #2 in market share , with Binance dominating. However, Coinbase is a significant enough player that if/when volume and interest returns to crypto, it stands to benefit mightily. With a now-reduced workforce, operating leverage on higher revenue would theoretically be significant, and profitability could ramp quite quickly. Coinbase also has the resources to weather this crypto bear market for a long time to come, as it has about $5 billion in cash on the balance sheet against $3.4 billion in long-term borrowings. It’s still unprofitable, so the amount of cash it has is important in terms of funding deficits until such time as it can fund itself through operations. Perhaps the biggest problem Coinbase has, and indeed why it has cut so many jobs, is that revenue continues to decline. Seeking Alpha The company has seen almost continuous cuts to revenue estimates as the bear market in crypto drags on and on, and until these turn around, the stock is facing a significant headwind. I’ll note the cuts have slowed in terms of intensity recently, which is indicative of the early signs of a bottom. But I’ll be clear that we’re not there yet, so I’m not suggesting Coinbase has seen its revenue estimates hit their absolute bottom yet. When they do, the stock will almost certainly be off to the races, but it’s simply too early to suggest that. The bottom line Coinbase’s recent round of job cuts are painful for all involved, but a necessary step given the company clearly overinvested in talent in the past couple of years. Q1 results may be the “kitchen sink” quarter that could see the stock finally shed the bear market it’s been mired in for over a year, but it’s a bit early to know that at the moment. What I see now is a stock that made its tradable bottom, has positive news flow on reduced operating expenditures, and is putting in some very bullish signs on the chart. It is possible we get a short squeeze on Coinbase, so that’s something to keep in mind if you’re taking the other side here and looking to short, from a risk management perspective. The 50-day simple moving average and the $46 price level should provide some resistance to the bulls, so I would not be surprised to see a pullback and test of the 20-day exponential moving average. However, after the current short-term overbought condition is resolved, I’m having a hard time making a bear case for Coinbase. If the stock fails the 20-day exponential moving average whenever the next pullback occurs, I’ll reassess, but for now, the job cuts appear to have ignited the bulls, and I’m not one to fight such a move.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569304-coinbase-job-cuts-ignite-bulls?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7412707.jpeg

The company likely needs to raise cash soon to continue funding mining operations. Meanwhile, the company is transitioning to an HPC business. HUT is a tough business to value with so many lingering questions, but the BTC on the balance sheet provides a massive valuation backstop. Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) is a publicly traded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining company based in Canada. The company is known in the Bitcoin mining space for being one of the few mining businesses that champions the 'HODL' approach to corporate balance sheet management; choosing not to sell any of the Bitcoin that it mines. This approach has resulted in Hut 8 Mining having one of the largest BTC treasuries of any publicly traded company, let alone public Bitcoin miners: Mining Company December BTC production BTC Treasury Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 475 12,232 Hut 8 Mining 161 9,086 Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) 659 6,952 HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) 214 2,348 Bit Digital ( BTBT ) 130 947 Source: company press releases, sorted by BTC Treasury Marathon Digital's stack, while larger than every other public miner stack, is only 64% unencumbered - making Hut 8 the largest unencumbered publicly listed miner-held HODL stack. Production Woes Hut 8's stack is large, but the company's coin production has fallen off a cliff; now down 57% from the August high of 375 Bitcoin. Author-generated graphic (Company filings) There have been several issues that have plagued Hut 8's mining production going back to August: ""The Merge"" North Bay Operations Energy Prices We can see in the chart above the monthly production peaked in August. Prior to Ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) merge from proof of work to proof of stake, Hut 8 had been using GPU machines to mine Ethereum and convert the mined ETH to BTC. Those GPU machines can no longer be used to mine Ethereum and will be applied to different revenue streams according to the company - more on that in a moment. As bad as losing Ethereum mining is, the bigger issue for Hut has been related to commodity prices and powering the company's North Bay facility. In November, Hut 8 delivered a default notice to power supplier Validus after what Hut 8 claims to be a breach of obligations pursuant to a power purchase agreement the two entities reached in 2021. That default notice has been met with a loss of power at North Bay: Validus has subsequently suspended delivery of energy to the Company’s mining operations in North Bay and delivered a notice of event of default alleging that Hut 8 failed to make certain payments related to the delivery of energy to the North Bay site, an allegation which the Company categorically denies. Hut 8 has requested mediation to help reach a solution to the energy problem at that facility. According to CEO Jaime Leverton from the company's quarterly call in November, North Bay is the smallest mining operation site: North Bay was running at approximately 25 megawatts compared to our Alberta sites, which are combined over 100 megawatts. In addition to the problems at North Bay, Hut 8 intentionally reduced mining operations in the month of December due to high energy prices. Unusually high energy prices led Hut 8 to curtail production and sell power back to the provider While this has slowed the company's ability to scale BTC holdings to close out the year, it has allowed HUT to raise some funds by monetizing energy, though no raw figures were provided in the December production update press release. An Adapting Business Model It's very clear Hut 8 is moving away from just a mining entity to be more of a diversified technology business. Last month, the company brought on a new Chief Financial Officer who has a background in cloud computing. Furthermore, ""high performance computing"" is ahead of ""digital asset mining"" under the ""what we do"" tab on the company's website: Homepage view (Hut 8) With the Ethereum merge in the rear-view mirror, Hut 8 is now aiming to transition those GPU machines to HPC solutions with eyes on Web3, gaming, and AI products. Where possible, the company has highlighted the potential for PoW mining, but as I've detailed previously , those options are very limited. December Investor Deck (Hut 8) This business pivot is on the speculative side but it is does have potential - especially in a Web3 environment where data storage and rendering services could become more needed. That said, according to the company's financial statements, HPC services don't actually appear to be growing: Q1-22 Q2-22 Q3-22 Total Revenue $53,333 $43,845 $31,671 HPC Revenue $3,290 $4,711 $4,403 HPC % of Total 6.16% 10.7% 13.9% Source: Company financials, figures in CAD The Q1 figure is only for part of the quarter as Hut 8's acquisition of HPC company TeraGo wasn't completed until the end of January 2022. On the surface, it appears Hut 8's growth in HPC revenue as a share of total revenue is more attributable to the declining value of Bitcoin than anything else. The Bitcoin Position Despite aspirations for a more diverse business, the elephant in the room is Hut 8's market capitalization has become more dependent on the price of Bitcoin than anything else. With 9,086 BTC on the balance sheet, HUT's BTC treasury is valued at over $158 million given a $17.4 BTC price. With a market cap of $239 million, HUTs cap is backstopped by its Bitcoin treasury by 64%. While HUT's has always had a large portion of its equity value derived from its BTC position, this is well ahead of what has been normal for the company from Q2-21 through Q3-22: Quarter Shares Outstanding Closing Price Market Cap BTC on Balance BTC Price Treasury Backing Jun 2021 143,300,000 $4.40 $630,520,000 4,123 $35,040 22.9% Sep 2021 164,400,000 $8.40 $1,380,960,000 4,724 $43,790 15.0% Dec 2021 169,600,000 $7.85 $1,331,360,000 5,518 $46,306 19.2% Mar 2022 174,200,000 $5.52 $961,584,000 6,460 $45,540 30.6% Jun 2022 192,100,000 $1.33 $255,493,000 7,406 $19,785 57.4% Sep 2022 196,200,000 $1.78 $349,236,000 8,388 $19,432 46.7% Dec 2022 211,896,000 $0.85 $180,111,600 9,125 $16,602 84.1% Source: Share/Pricing from Seeking Alpha, Author Calculations The 84% market cap backstopping by the BTC on balance sheet at the end of last year was, in my view, absolutely absurd and Hut 8's share price was assigning very little value to the company's physical assets or HPC business at all. Given the rally in crypto equities over the last several days, the ratio has come down a bit. But this phenomenon has been largely exclusive to HUT as no other public miner with a top 5 HODL stack trades with this large of a treasury to market cap ratio today: Mining Company BTC Treasury BTC Treasury to MC Ratio Marathon Digital 12,232 31.2% Hut 8 Mining 9,086 63.5% Riot Blockchain 6,952 12.7% HIVE Blockchain 2,348 16.9% Bit Digital 947 30.0% Source: Company releases, author calculations Given the production declines, cash depletion, and questions about future business questions, I tend to agree with the market that HUT's valuation should come more from its BTC than other companies in the mining space, but 64% is probably too much. Risks Mining Bitcoin is an expensive business to operate and taking a HODL strategy to balance sheet management carries quite a bit of dilution risk. Based on the quarterly cash burn from operations in previous quarters, it appears as though Hut 8 is close to out of cash as of end of 2022. I suspect the company will likely have to raise capital either through dilution, debt, or Bitcoin sales to continue operating. In my view, this anticipation for a cash raise is what has been hurting HUT's share price in recent weeks. Additionally, HUT is now up more than 50% from the 52 week low of 78 cents in late December. If HUT is going to raise with dilution, it's probably going to be relatively soon to take advantage of the rally from lows. The question is how much dilution will shareholders get. But this is far from the only question HUT longs need to ask themselves. Other questions include the HPC business and North Bay. How quickly can new revenue streams scale? When will North Bay have power? So far, we can only guess. Closing Thoughts Hut 8 Mining is currently the only publicly traded Bitcoin miner that I have exposure to at this time. There are others that I find to be interesting, but given the directional uncertainty in the crypto market broadly, I'm limiting my mining exposure to the companies that have as little debt as possible and that have large BTC treasury positions. In my view, Hut 8 has a good balance of those two factors. I did buy more shares of HUT when the stock fell below $0.90. However, after rallying 50% from the low of $0.78, I view HUT as a hold today as this rally could be approaching exhaustion and there are too many questions about the company's future business operations.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569292-hut-8-mining-more-questions-than-answers?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7412284.jpeg

42410870,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsCk7,1673464449,Top NFT Artists Are Launching Projects on Instagram and Selling Out in Seconds,"Instagram is one of the largest social media platforms in the world, with around 2 billion monthly active users. Early last year, its parent company Meta Platforms began testing out non-fungible token (NFT) sharing, allowing select users to connect to their digital wallets and showcase NFTs that they either created or bought.  The feature gained traction as NFT creators and collectors saw future opportunities to present their digital assets to a wider audience of Web3-curious consumers. Some even suggested that Instagram's planned support could help NFTs finally reach mainstream adoption because of its expansive reach.  Encouraged by positive feedback and eager to embrace the creator economy, Instagram slowly started expanding its Digital Collectibles feature, allowing select digital artists to begin minting and selling NFTs directly on the platform.  The addition of NFT trading for a platform like Instagram makes sense considering its huge global audience. The feature exposes users to Web3 concepts, many for the first time, in a way that doesn't add friction to Instagram's core business model. Users on Instagram also pay for NFTs in fiat currency, eliminating an otherwise challenging on-ramp for Web3 newcomers.  But attracting a Web3-native audience poses more challenges. Would seasoned NFT collectors be interested in purchasing assets sold on a highly centralized, Web2 platform? In addition, Instagram in-app purchases are subject to steep fees between 15% to 30% from Apple and Google, resulting in a smaller profit for sellers.  Despite this, early NFT sales on the platform have been a success, with collections selling out quickly. Instagram's strategy of recruiting well-known NFT artists to tout the new feature has worked in two ways – it enticed NFT collectors and helped to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 users.  Bringing in Web3 builders  While blockchain natives may have been skeptical of Instagram's foray into Web3, the platform's partnership with well-known NFT artists has helped instill confidence across communities. Drifter Shoots (aka Isaac Wright), Refik Anadol, Amber Vittoria, Dave Krugman and Micah Johnson have each launched NFTs through Instagram over the past few months, selling out each time.  ""Digital collectibles make a lot of sense when you consider where many of us do our social signaling,"" Krugman wrote in a post on Instagram teasing his first NFT drop in November.  Other popular NFT artists, such as Maliha Abidi and Bobby Hundreds, have used the platform to show off their NFT creations, praising the feature as an accessible way to reach prospective buyers.  ""We're stoked to usher in the feature, not only because it brings up the conversation of NFTs to the platform, but because it gives us the chance to re-educate the bright future we see ahead for NFTs and Web3,"" Adam Bomb Squad, Bobby Hundreds' NFT collection, wrote in a post showing off one of its signature characters.  There often exists an awkward relationship when traditional Web2 companies are looking to use a Web3 toolkit. Their efforts to release NFTs or buy land in the metaverse are sometimes seen as ""PR stunts"" that pander to Web3 enthusiasts, and are not always well-received.  A blueprint for mass adoption  With so much hype surrounding an image-first social network embracing blockchain art, Instagram has made sure to introduce digital collectibles in ways that feel organic to both its mainstream audience and Web3 natives. For example, Instagram users can share NFTs in their feed the way they would any other image, but there's also a dedicated tab for digital collectibles to create both a sense of integration and separation of content.  Reflecting this, the platform chose the Polygon blockchain to initially launch its Digital Collectibles feature, a move that aligns with the layer 2 blockchain company's stated goal of becoming a ""funnel"" for Web2 brands looking to jump into Web3.  “We’ve built this great funnel for partners to come through and make the onboarding to Polygon really seamless,” Polygon CEO Ryan Wyatt told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” last month.  Polygon's recent partnerships with Nike, Reddit and Starbucks have all been majorly successful. Its holistic approach to brand integrations and focus on easing the process for Web2 companies has paid off. According to data from blockchain analytics platform Nansen, first-time and returning buyers per day in Polygon’s NFT ecosystem reached new all-time highs last month.  Polygon has also logged wins featuring Web3 native brands – albeit at a cost. One of Solana's top NFT projects, Y00ts, recently made the switch to Polygon, with its parent company DeLabs receiving a non-equity grant of $3 million from Polygon to make it happen.  Nansen data suggests that Polygon records nearly triple the number of daily transactions compared to Ethereum, and logged 823,000 unique active daily wallet addresses over the last day. However, the overall trading volume of Polygon NFTs on the secondary market, where seasoned NFT collectors go to flip their digital collectibles for profit, pales in comparison to Ethereum NFTs, reflecting the low-cost blockchain's overall focus on onboarding new collectors versus fostering projects for Web3 natives.  Some Polygon-based projects have also opted to use the word ""digital collectibles"" instead of ""NFTs"" in their branding, a move that distances them from the controversies plaguing the crypto market. The term is seen as more friendly to newcomers who are unfamiliar with crypto jargon.  So far, Instagram's methodical entry into Web3 has shown promise for other Web2 brands looking to make the jump.

42411047,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBE61,1673463722,"Real Crypto Adoption Needs Real Crypto Infrastructure (These 7 Upgrades, for Starters)","Kgothatso Ngako saw a problem. He believed his neighbors in Africa would benefit from owning bitcoin, but most did not own smartphones. Internet penetration in Africa is only 30%. Millions were unable to, as the slogan puts it, “be their own bank.”  Ngako wanted to change this. A former software engineer at Amazon, he had already worked to translate bitcoin education materials – such as Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper – into over 20 African languages including Kiswahili, Shona and Oshiwambo. But that would only go so far. Knowledge would be worthless unless people had a way to actually own bitcoin.  “Luckily, on the African continent the GSM infrastructure is quite solid,” says Ngako. So thanks to this network, many Africans used text-based flip phones. Could Ngako tap into the GSM infrastructure and create something bitcoin-compatible?  He quit his job and built “Machankura.” The word doesn’t have an exact translation, but Ngako says it’s a “slang term that usually refers to money.” Machankura is a text-based interface that allows for the sending, receiving and spending of bitcoin, enabled by the Lightning network. A user can create a Lightning wallet directly on their flip-phone. Over our Zoom call, Ngako held up a phone and demonstrated the functionality: A simple screen gives options for 1. Send BTC; 2. Receive BTC; 3; Balance and History; 4. Spend BTC, and so on.  Machankura is still in its early beta phase, but Ngako says it has been in active use for six months. He envisions solutions like this as a way to onboard more Africans, adoption he sees as long overdue.  Read more: Cory Klippsten et al. - The Ten Biggest Developments in Bitcoin in 2022  “From an adoption perspective, bitcoin is not where it should be,” says Ngako. He notes that Mobile Money, a digital (non-crypto) payment platform launched in 2007, has 6 million active users in Kenya. Why can’t bitcoin do the same thing?  Or, zooming out the lens, why isn’t there more bitcoin and crypto adoption? What’s holding back the tech? The recent problems of the space have been well-chronicled – the meltdowns of FTX and Celsius Network, the pop of the non-fungible token (NFT) bubble, the jitters of a recession, the whims of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the overall souring of the vibes.  But you can also point to a shaky infrastructure. “The infrastructure that is driving Web3, broadly, has some catching up to do,” says Ryan Servatius, head of strategic partnerships at Mysten Labs. Many have argued that the crypto space is now where the internet was in the early 1990s. Servatius takes the analogy one step further: He argues that the internet did not flourish until its infrastructure matured.  “Infrastructure was the key ingredient,” says Servatius. “Broadband penetration was the single critical driver,” as the Netflix and YouTubes would not be possible “until you had sufficient broadband penetration in the United States.” Servatius believes that the blockchain space is still “pre-broadband,” and that we “still have to get that infrastructure stood up at a level that will allow the world to embrace something that is fast and cheap.”  There’s little consensus on exactly how the infrastructure should be improved. Or which projects will win. Ask 100 people in crypto and you’ll get 100 different answers. A debate between the bitcoin maximalists, Ethereum die-hards, and the many aspiring “Ethereum Killers” (such as Solana, Cardano or Servatius’ Mysten Labs) would make Kevin McCarthy’s Speaker of the House debacle, by comparison, look like the pinnacle of Athenian democracy.  When blockchain works, it’ll be boring.  And what even counts as “blockchain infrastructure”? You could make the argument that every project in crypto – meme coins excluded – is a type of infrastructure. It’s a tricky concept. It’s almost unpleasant. Compare this to the more colorful corners of the space: You can squint and visualize the virtual reality of the metaverse; it’s easy to imagine the artwork of an NFT; you can even understand (if not endorse) the appeal of “number go up” price speculation.  Read more: Andrew Keys - 23 Blockchain Predictions for 2023  But infrastructure almost feels invisible, and maybe that’s the point. “The average person shouldn’t know anything about infrastructure,” says Andrew Keys, co-founder and managing partner of Darma Capital. This is how it works on the internet. “When you buy a ticket on Orbitz to fly somewhere, no one gives a [damn] if you use a SQL database or a Kafka database. You just use Orbitz,” says Keys. Blockchain should work the same way. “When blockchain works, it’ll be boring,” says Keys, adding that the experience should feel no different from the world of Web2, with the exception that “instead of an intermediary extracting 40% for putting a driver and passenger together, a la Uber, [when] it should only cost 1%.”  That’s the goal. And if the space wants to emerge from crypto winter, it will take real progress on this boring, behind-the-scenes, invisible work of plumbing and wiring. That’s what’s needed for widespread adoption – it needs to be easy and accessible and fun.  So with the understanding that this is far from comprehensive and likely to spark debate – (if it didn’t, we’d be doing it wrong) – these seven buckets are what we talk about when we talk about blockchain infrastructure:  Smoother UX across the board  What’s it like for a newbie to purchase an NFT? “It’s a train wreck,” says Paul Brody, the head of blockchain projects at Ernst & Young. “If you try to take a new person through buying an NFT it’s incredibly horrifying.” You first need to create an account in an exchange like Coinbase or Binance, then open a MetaMask wallet, transfer funds, connect to OpenSea and so on. “Compare that to using ApplePay to buy something online,” says Brody. “It’s just a really terrible, terrible experience.”  Brody suspects that true widespread adoption, especially for large companies, will not happen without smoother software. “It has to be easy enough for a typical enterprise IT developer to make use of,” says Brody. “They have to be able to plug it in. It can’t be, ‘Hey, I need to build a specialist blockchain team.’” (Brody’s team at EY is working on such solutions; they’ve already piloted a supply chain project with Peroni beer.)  In a similar vein, other projects are trying to make it easier for Web2 companies to plug-and-play with Web3 on the consumer side. Take “brand loyalty” NFTs. I’ve spoken to many Web3 advocates who are bullish on mainstream brands using social tokens, NFTs, or other chunks of Web3 to create super-charged rewards programs – frequent flyer accounts on steroids. But the exact how this happens seemed to be a yada yada yada.  Enter projects such as Dispatch, which is building ways for companies to directly communicate with crypto end users, such as zapping messages to their Ledger wallets. Then this syncs to the company’s normal CRM [customer relationship management] interface, a la Salesforce. “I tell everybody, this is the future, but I’m going to put it in your CRM for you,” says Byron Sorrells, head of Dispatch. “You have to meet users where they are. We can’t expect another massive behavior change for adoption. I think it will be, ‘I’m doing what I’ve always done, but underneath it is the magic of Web3.’”  In his own way, Sorrells is using the same playbook as Ngako in Africa: Expanding the crypto infrastructure by creating an easy solution for the end user. In Ngako’s case, it’s letting Kenyans use their text-phones to get bitcoin. In Sorrell’s, it’s using enterprise software but injecting it with NFTs, or as he puts it, “Mailchimp, but make it blockchain.”  Better (decentralized) wallets  “We need really great wallets,” says Paulina Joskow, head of partnerships at Ramp, a project that’s building payment rails connecting crypto to the global financial system. “They’re the backbone of how we use and operate in the crypto ecosystem every day.” The current state of wallets? The way Joskkw sees it, “We’re not ready for the next wave of mainstream adoption.”  The “Better Wallets” mission is what Kgothatso Ngako is working on in Africa. The Better Wallets mission is why Ledger hired Tony Fadell, the designer of the original Apple iPod, to create its next generation devices. And the Better Wallets mission, for many in the space, is a way to bring crypto back to its decentralized roots.  The scalability and the privacy provided by Zero Knowledge proofs are essential.  “What we learned this year is that a lot of these non-self-custody solutions – centralized finance solutions – had major problems,” says Amanda Cassatt, founder of the Serotonin marketing agency. She points to the meltdowns of FTX, Celsius Network and BlockFi as centralized solutions that ran amuck. “This highlighted the need to have really good UX, but also to enable genuine self-custody by users.”  The FTXes of the world might not have been safe, but they were a snap to use. Cassatt wants to see that same dead-simple experience, with a decentralized twist. “I actually don’t really think that someone has gotten onboarded into Web3 if they’re not custodying their own crypto,” says Cassatt, formerly chief marketing officer at ConsenSys, the Ethereum development studio. There’s an understandable reluctance to go full self-custody. The average person (myself included) gets queasy at the idea of having to keep track of a 16-word seed phrase. Or to keep a hardware wallet safe. Within months of buying a car, for example, I lost the title and had to spend hours at the DMV pleading my case; maybe crypto could help me “be my own bank,” but I have a feeling I’d be a lousy bank.  So what’s needed, Cassatt argues, is not a centralized solution but easier decentralized ones. Something to let even the pinheads like me feel comfortable. Cassatt is bullish on the concept of “progressive sovereignty,” where a user gradually becomes more of their own custodian as they learn more about Web3.  “The mission right now is to get as many people as possible to self-custody their bitcoin,” says Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at Human Rights Foundation and a prominent Bitcoin advocate. “Right now, we don’t need any fancy software upgrades for Bitcoin to do that.” Gladstein believes that “the infrastructure is more on the app level.” (He considers Ngako’s work in Africa, as well as the self-custody Muun wallet, as prime examples.) Gladstein acknowledges that the Bitcoin network software will eventually need an upgrade, but says “we haven’t crossed that bridge yet.”  While it’s true that newbies struggle with seed phrases, Gladstein notes that in the 1990s his parents struggled to remember curious new terms like “email passwords” and “usernames.” They used sticky notes on their monitors. “Ultimately, we figured out ways to deal with that,” says Gladstein, “and that did not stop email from taking over the world.”  Building better bridges  How good is one blockchain at playing nice with another blockchain? Glitches still happen. This leads to theft and a loss of trust in the system, as over $2 billion was hacked from blockchain bridges, according to an estimate from Chainalysis.  “I really hope we can spend the next months or years, depending on how long the bear market lasts, improving how we approach bridging between layers,” says Joskow, at Ramp. “Because this is something we need to do without giving it a second thought.” For example, she believes that we’ll soon be in a world where Ethereum’s layer 2 systems (such as Optimism and Arbitrum) will be widely used side by side, depending on the context and the application. “So before we approach mainstream adoption,” she says, “we need to provide a secure way for people to swap tokens between layers.”  The primacy of privacy  For those who are unfamiliar with the space, the concept of “crypto privacy” has the whiff of the Dark Web, illegal drugs, money laundering and the funding of terrorists. Privacy can sound a little naughty.  If you’re in this camp, you should have a conversation with Paul Brody, the executive at Ernst & Young. Brody explains that privacy is essential to corporate America, and this has been true since the early days of the internet. Think about e-commerce. “The killer application of the internet, as it were, turned out to be commerce. Buying stuff,” says Brody. “For that we had to have privacy.” Imagine if all of your Amazon purchases were visible for the world to see. Thanks to the boring internet infrastructure work of SSL encryption, we can shop online safely. “That’s entirely missing today from the blockchain ecosystem,” says Brody. “That’s job #1.”  Just as you want to keep your Amazon splurges to yourself, companies need to keep their operations private. If a car manufacturer, for example, uses a public smart contract to buy tires from a supplier, the on-chain transactions could tip their hand to competitors. “The details of corporate supply chains are very, very sensitive,” says Brody, which is why supply chain projects are “almost impossible on a public blockchain.” (His team at EY is working on solutions, some of which will be tested in the next few months.)  “Web3 is vastly more transparent than the web we’re trying to replace,” says Alex Pruden, CEO of Aleo (a privacy-focused blockchain system). “If you buy your wife an anniversary gift, all of that is on-chain and recorded for all the world to see.” He believes this is “one reason you haven’t seen broader adoption,” which is why “the scalability and the privacy provided by Zero-Knowledge proofs are essential.”  Read more: Dan Kuhn - Decentralized Social Media – Has the Moment Come?  Zero-Knowledge poofs (or ZK proofs) let you prove that something is true without disclosing other sensitive data. It shares only what’s needed. An easy example: In today’s world, if you walk into a bar and are asked to show your ID, the bouncer can see details including your home address, height and driver’s license number. But the only relevant data is your birthday – are you over 21? In a smart ID that’s powered by ZK proofs, the only thing you’d show the bouncer is a field displaying “Over 21.”  Pruden is so passionate about the importance of ZK infrastructure that he organized an open competition, called “ZPrize,” to goose its growth and innovation. He says that over $4 million has been awarded so far; the prizes are for extremely simple-sounding categories including “Accelerating MSM Operations on GPU/FPGA,” “Plonk-DIZK GPU Acceleration,” and “Accelerating NTT Operations on an FPGA.” And people think this stuff is complicated?  Web3 social infrastructure  Cassatt predicts that 2023 will be “The Year of Web3 social,” finally unlocking decentralized alternatives to the Twitters and Facebooks of the world. (Others do, too.) Whereas many grumble, with some merit, that blockchain is often “a solution in search of a problem,” here the problem is clear: The clout you earn on one platform can’t be ported to another. This feels suddenly relevant as Twitter wobbles.  Mainstream adoption of Web3 social media won’t happen, says Cassatt, without more work on a protocol level. She points to Lens Protocol as her favorite example, which allows for people to build their own decentralized, censorship-resistant social media applications. “That’s going to onboard a lot of users,” Cassatt says, partly because this use case is “less dependent on price” and instead offers “real utility on Web3.”  Indexing  Data needs to be indexed to be quickly accessed. “The analytics and indexing infrastructure is really, really important for developers,” says Pruden at Aleo. Without getting too deep in the weeds (or drilling down into things like “Plonk-DIZK GPU Acceleration”), the key point is that there are different ways that indexing can be done. Centralized or decentralized. Pruden hopes to see more open-sourced, decentralized indexing solutions emerge, as these are part of the “defaults” for the overall system. “The defaults today are hosted infrastructure and non self-hosted wallets,” says Pruden. “And if we don’t push back against those defaults, then those forces of gravity will continue to get stronger and stronger.”  Finally, something crucial to just about every project in the space:  More scalability  Thanks to the Lightning Network, transactions that took 10 minutes on Bitcoin can now happen in a millisecond. This breakthrough in infrastructure is what enabled Strike (the mobile payments app) to launch in El Salvador, which paved the way for legal tender. While the verdict is still out on the El Salvador bitcoin experiment, it’s a plum example of how boring, quiet progress in infrastructure can suddenly unleash breakthroughs.  Read more: Ethereum Pulled Off The Year’s Biggest Blockchain Event  Dozens of competing layer 1 projects, of course, are all racing to deliver faster and cheaper and greener and better alternatives to Ethereum. The work at Lightning continues (such as helping developers build Lightning-friendly apps), as does the work of Ethereum itself. “Ethereum does require more scaling,” says Brody. “The Merge doesn’t solve all the problems.” He views the Merge upgrade to proof-of-stake as a triumph for demonstrating that Ethereum could “migrate $700 billion worth of mission-critical infrastructure without a hiccup,“ but it’s just part of a much longer journey.  Ethereum’s short-term focus is on sharding, which the Ethereum Foundation defines as a “multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereum’s scalability and capacity,” which should further lower fees. The full road map was sketched by Vitalik Buterin himself, containing the milestones of “Surge, Verge, Purge and Splurge.” Hats off to Buterin, as “Merge” isn’t the easiest word to rhyme.

42411275,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMaa2,1673463000,Why Blockchains Are as Important as ERP for the Future of Companies,"The great decoupling.  If there is a silver lining in the experiences of the last few months, it may turn out to be one that turns the world of blockchain away from financial engineering and towards more compelling business applications that truly create value.  In the last year we have successfully dispensed with the myth that crypto banks the unbanked, that crypto is a good hedge against inflation and that financial engineering from Decentralized finance (DeFi) can somehow generate a better return on investment than any other form of asset. People have stopped asking me about my price predictions for digital assets and have gone back to asking about use cases. And that is progress.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  The decoupling that is happening now is one where we separate the value of Ethereum as a global computing and business infrastructure, from the price of ether (ETH) and all these other digital assets. One of the guiding principles that we have built on here at EY is the idea that blockchains will do for business ecosystems what ERP did inside the enterprise. This new year is the perfect time to revisit that idea.  ERP stands for enterprise resource planning, and even if you don’t know what it is your life experience has been profoundly shaped by its existence. It is, very simply, the software that makes companies run. It’s the software that links an empty store shelf to a pull signal in the warehouse that brings more product. It’s how companies manage to offer consistent products, services and prices at scale all across our planet.  Enterprise transactions have been slow to take off because of the lack of privacy tools, which are essential. As that problem gets solved (see my prior discussion), we can start to think about how firms can interact with each other. The story of 2023 will, I hope, be about how useful applications start to emerge for connecting enterprises with each other, under privacy and on the public Ethereum ecosystem.  In this environment, we will have to build more slowly and carefully than we did with DeFi. Enterprise users are a more cautious bunch, and we’re already seeing skittish users worrying that the “taint” of crypto Ponzi schemes is hurting their ability to sell the vision inside the enterprise. This will slow things down but not stop them.  Read more: Paul Brody - The Ethereum Killers Are All Zombies Now  The likely order of development will be a risk-averse path. Companies are going to start with things like inventory management. Better visibility improves supply chain operations, and with privacy tools you can more easily manage your assets across an extended network. However, if you are matching, say, a physical inventory asset with a digital token, and that token is hacked or stolen, you haven’t really lost anything valuable. It’s not so much theft as it is data corruption. That’s a minor manageable problem, not a catastrophe you have to call the board about.  The next step after tracking assets is the addition of shared business logic. Companies are good at negotiating deals but often bad at remembering things like how much volume they have purchased before a discount or rebate kicks in. With smart contracts covering the sales process, that can become automatic.  It would be nice to take a break from the financialization of everything and focus on doing real stuff.  Eventually, of course, we’ll get back to where we started: money. Closing the loop in a business smart contract means paying for things purchased, and if all the other business logic and rules have already been applied it’s most efficient and useful to close the contract out by making payment with a stablecoin. Companies will also be able to do things like factor invoices and borrow against inventory value. But those financialization components are likely to be down the road and will be the last components of the system implemented by risk-averse enterprises, not the first.  Prepare yourself, though, as this revolution may be about as exciting as watching paint dry. Part of the explosive growth of crypto has been driven by consumers who can make decisions quickly. New technology can run through the consumer world in a decade. If there is a single rule above most others in the world of enterprise IT, it’s this: “If it ain’t broke, we’re not going to spend any money fixing it.” That means systems get replaced when they break or when a major new set of capabilities are needed or the return on the fix is large enough. We’re two decades into the cloud computing era, and while nearly all new systems are cloud-based most enterprise computing still isn’t in the cloud. Don’t expect faster with blockchain.  Finance has had a huge role in “paying the bills” in the last few years of crypto. Five years of triple-digit growth wouldn’t have been possible without the consumer embrace of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFT), and I’m truly grateful for the growth and experience we have earned from that work. I think there will be more of it to come too: DeFi is far from over. But this year, 2023, I think it would be nice to take a break from the financialization of everything and focus on doing real stuff with real assets and real businesses.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/11/why-blockchains-are-as-important-as-erp-for-the-future-of-companies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dba0e6b2bc3c1c948cdfa79e58fc09250dce2300-5000x3335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The problem with that outsized bet is valuations across bitcoin-mining firms have deteriorated significantly over the course of the market downturn, due to a combination of depressed BTC prices, elevated energy/electricity prices and a high network hash rate. That said, it could be tough to recover value from Cyprus-registered Genesis Digital, as only around half of the funds from Alameda to Genesis Digital went to the miner's operations, The Wall Street Journal noted, citing corporate-registration documents and people familiar with the firm. And over $500M bought existing shares from two co-founders of Genesis Digital. The miner, which is owned by most of the its founders, received funds from Alameda, the crypto hedge fund in which Bankman-Fried owned a majority stake, ""at market value,"" a spokeswoman for Genesis Digital, which labeled itself as a low-cost bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner, told the newspaper.

7409186,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515747,1673460056,"Solana Price Surge Attracts Investors, What’s Driving It?","Solana’s price has achieved an unexpected week-long rally, causing it to significantly outperform almost all other cryptocurrencies. As the price of the centralized smart contract token stabilizes, investors are showing interest in how high it can go. In the first week of 2023, the price of Solana (SOL) soared in value, going from $9.7 to $17.50. As a result, trade volume in SOL has increased, and Wallet Investor predicts that SOL will hit new highs in 2023. The current Solana price, as reported by CoinMarketCap, is $15.87. The value has decreased by 0.50% over the past 24 hours. There are currently 370,184,196 SOL in circulation, which gives it a market cap of $5,915,802,434 and a position in the top 12 of CoinMarketCap’s rankings. Related Reading: Solana Moves On From FTX Calamity, Sparkles 46% In Last 7 Days SOL Dominates The Market In the weeks following the FTX crash, the price of SOL had taken numerous beatings, eventually falling to single-digit values for the first time in two years. However, Solana beat the market by coming back from the dead and seeing a price hike again. With daily volume near its average of $6 million, the price of SOL has settled at the new rally’s top boundaries. This indication is bullish, as buying and selling have not yet grown in a bearish direction. As a result of these considerations, the next bullish goal is the $20 level, as it touched $17.50, representing a 30% increase from the current price. The historical correlation between an overbought RSI and buyer exhaustion has led many traditional investors to view an overbought RSI as a probable sell signal. So, to get the RSI back below 69, the price of SOL may go through a correction or a sideways consolidation phase. Related Reading: Will Solana Price Continue To Surge After The Explosive Price Rally? Messari Outlines Solana’s Growth Factors A recent tweet from Vitalik Buterin and the enthusiasm in the protocol’s meme coin Bonk (BONK) are just two of the many variables that have contributed to the rise of SOL, according to crypto analytics service Messari. And when more individuals buy than sell, the value of digital currency increases. Despite its rising transaction volume, SOL’s declining gas fees were cited by Messari’s senior analyst Tom Dunleavy as one of the two most likely fundamentals fueling the coin’s continuous growth. According to the update released by Messari, the protocol no longer appears to be facing the outages it had been experiencing. The price of Solana’s native coin dropped last year due to a couple of factors, including multiple network disruptions and the harsh crypto winter. The downtime was bad enough to get Cardano’s founder, the outspoken Charles Hoskinson, to criticize the protocol publicly.

Lau has an outperform rating on COIN, with a price target of $73 in the next 12 to 18 months. In a note published on Monday, Lau predicted there will be “less than five legitimate crypto exchanges,” with Coinbase being one of them.  According to him, if the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, half of Coinbase’s revenue could be made up of the exchange’s subscription services, which are tied to a partnership with stablecoin issuer Circle. In addition, the “many positives” that have yet to be priced into the exchange’s stock include Coinbase's market share gains, its strong balance sheet and its short squeeze potential, he said.  Oppenheimer forecasts Coinbase’s 2022 revenue to come in at $3.2 billion, a steep drop from its revenue in 2021, which reached $7.8 billion. Coinbase is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings toward the end of February.  But whether the exchange will make good on its promise to drive revenue via subscription services remains to be seen. Its biggest revenue source is from trading, though that is in peril given retail investors’ waning appetite and confidence in crypto.  Oppenheimer’s estimates were issued Monday, one day before Coinbase said it would be laying off 20%, or roughly 950 people, from its workforce. In June, the exchange laid off more than 1,000 people.  “Given that COIN has a more regulated and compliant platform, leading position in digital assets space, strong balance sheet and high brand recognition, we believe COIN is well positioned to emerge stronger,” Lau wrote in his note.

42411269,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMaGC,1673456744,What’s the Relationship Between Crypto and AI? Is There Any?,"The past six months has been a banner stretch for the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Image processors such as Midjourney and text generators including ChatGPT have sparked immense public fascination and debate. Unlike the promise of self-driving cars, these applications seem ready for real commercial deployment.  That could pose a problem for tech innovators focused on public blockchains and distributed computing. At minimum, artificial intelligence will be a huge competitor for investment funding for the foreseeable future, particularly given the reputational damage various scammers and frauds inflicted on crypto over the past year.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There are also deeper differences between the structure and underlying ethos of blockchains and artificial intelligence. Up to now, AI has effectively required large, centralized data caches for training, which could help create the kind of privacy and security risks to which crypto and blockchain communities are deeply opposed.  Further, this dependence on data caches makes AI ripe for capture by large, centralized corporations. We’re seeing this unfold right now: Microsoft’s gargantuan $10 billion bet on Open AI and ChatGPT is clearly premised on the restrictive deployment of the technology in corporate products.  Composable AI  But there is a very different approach to AI that could help address this inherent undemocratic bias.  You see, aside from digital cash, one of the clearest viable applications of blockchains is for managing distributed computing resources. Blockchains can be used to coordinate and verify services to a network, with tokens providing incentives to contributors. So far, blockchains have been deployed to incentivize and manage things such as distributed cloud storage (Filecoin) and distributed high-end graphics compute (Render Network).  Another interesting example is BitTorrent, which began life as a nontokenized, peer-to-peer file-sharing network. But researchers circa 2017 began theorizing that tokenizing the network could make it better for all users by rewarding users with the fastest connections. In 2018 Tron founder Justin Sun bought the service, proposing to do just that (though I won’t vouch for the technical specifics of the BTT implementation).  A number of blockchain projects have extended the logic of tokenized distributed computing to artificial intelligence. The most significant is probably SingularityNET, launched in 2017 by veteran AI researcher Ben Goertzel. Goertzel has been working on AI since the late 1980s, is the author of more than a dozen academic books on the topic and is credited with popularizing the term “artificial general intelligence.”  (SingularityNET is one of the relatively rare reputable projects that raised funds during the 2017 craze for ICOs, or initial coin offerings. Its token, AGIX, has seen a big rally in the wake of the Microsoft/Open AI deal.)  Goertzel often sums up SingularityNET’s approach to artificial intelligence in the words of pioneering computer science researcher Marvin Minsky, who envisioned AI developing as “a society of minds.” Goertzel describes SingularityNET as an open architecture for knitting together various so-called “narrow” artificial intelligences, such as language processors or navigators or image generators, that are each good at specific things.  See also: Ben Goertzel: Say Hello to the Singularity | Opinion  A user of SingularityNET can call for a specific combination of services on the network, which could be created and hosted anywhere in the world and freely linked to the network. This is fundamentally similar to the way financial services on a smart-contract platform like Ethereum can be knit together into larger packages, what’s referred to as “composability.”  Goertzel argues that such a composable AI network could democratize AI development in the same way cryptocurrencies and smart contracts democratize finance (though as we’ve seen, that’s a double-edged sword). Goertzel goes further, though, arguing that a recombinative environment for AI development, with each module developing independently, could be a better path to artificial general intelligence – that is, human-like digital minds.  One technical detail here is worth emphasizing: Artificial intelligence cannot run “on” a blockchain. At least given current technology, this would be unimaginably slow and expensive. SingularityNET and similar projects are devoted to using blockchains to manage off-chain resources, which does imply some technical risk because it requires layers of verification to ensure good inputs and outputs to and from the network.  Crypto philosophy vs. AI  Goertzel’s approach to AI is a useful contrast to the implied beliefs of AI’s current mainstream poster boy, Sam Altman. Altman is the CEO and co-founder of OpenAI, but he is also behind Worldcoin, a project that wants to create unique digital identities for global citizens by scanning their irises.  On its face, Altman’s Worldcoin project is contemptible for its willingness to harvest incredibly sensitive biometric data from vulnerable populations. But its implied relationship to AI may be even darker.  Many social and economic theorists, you see, predict that AI will create a world of extreme inequality. It will, the thinking goes, make workers like truck drivers and cashiers obsolete. And because AI is more likely to be centrally controlled, those wages will instead turn into profits for huge corporations.  See also: What Does an AI Chatbot 'Think' About DeFi?  Sam Altman’s Worldcoin is specifically geared towards implementing the main solution Silicon Valley has offered to this conundrum: universal basic income (UBI). The idea is that once AI wipes out everybody’s jobs, a government or similar entity will have to tax the few centralized AI administrators at a high enough rate to redistribute wealth to the plebeian masses. Worldcoin’s eyeball-scanning orb is intended, above all, to ensure that nobody can defraud that imagined future system by collecting multiple payments.  I’m a leftist, and believe that some degree of redistribution of wealth makes society more stable and productive. But even to me this Silicon Valley UBI vision is an authoritarian nightmare combining the worst features of bloated politburo communism and grasping monopolist capitalism. It would be a future in which the many are completely dependent on the generosity of the few. A techno-elite would run a kind of artificially intelligent Company Store of the exploitative variety bemoaned in traditional coal miner’s ballads.

42388225,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRAbFR,1673456201,"FTX Creditor Names Can Remain Sealed for Now, Judge Rules","A Delaware bankruptcy judge on Wednesday allowed a list of creditors for FTX to remain sealed for at least another three months.  Judge John Dorsey, overseeing the winding up of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire, shot down a bid by media organizations and the U.S. government to keep the legal process transparent, but indicated that he may change his mind during a future hearing.  “I'm reluctant at this point to say I'm going to require the disclosure,” Dorsey said at a hearing Wednesday.  “I'm going to overrule the objections and allow them [creditor lists] to remain sealed at this point,” he added, saying he would review the issue after three months. “We're talking about individuals here who are not present – individuals who may be at risk if their name and information is disclosed.”  Brian Glueckstein, an attorney at Sullivan & Cromwell representing FTX, told the court he wanted to “redact sensitive personal information of customers and other stakeholders” and “protect the value in the debtors customer list as an asset,” ensuring it can potentially be sold at a later stage of proceedings.  In a Nov. 19 filing, FTX argued the full creditor list would be unwieldy and potentially unreliable due to poor recordkeeping by Bankman-Fried. The company also argued publication could make users prone to identity theft and reduce the company’s value by allowing competitors to poach business.  Dorsey, in effect, saw the protection of privacy as paramount in spite of claims made that publishing a list of customer names would be the norm during bankruptcy.  “The public has a right to access of judicial records and only under very limited circumstances may a federal court restrict or deny that access,” said Juliet Sarkessian, representing the U.S. Trustee, part of the Department of Justice responsible for bankruptcy matters.  “Redacting customer and other creditor information to the extent that the debtors are seeking is only going to add to that lack of transparency” in a case in which many key documents have not yet been filed, Sarkessian added.  She was joined by lawyers representing media organizations that had argued in favor of greater transparency.  “There's absolutely no evidence presented to this court that there any identity theft or scams occurred as a result of those creditor lists being made public,” said David Finger of law firm Finger & Slanina, representing Bloomberg, Dow Jones, the New York Times and the Financial Times.  FTX filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, 2022, after CoinDesk revelations about its relationship with trading arm Alameda Research led to a run on the exchange. Restructuring expert John Ray took over from Bankman-Fried as chief executive officer on the same day.  Last year, as part of similar proceedings, a judge ordered the release of information on hundreds of thousands of users of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, prompting fears they could become vulnerable to harassment or theft.  The move could also have implications for customers of other bankrupt crypto companies such as BlockFi, whose users are in a similar quandary over privacy and whose case will be heard in a New Jersey court next week.

7406287,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515737,1673454600,"Altcoin Volume Dominance At Highest Since Jan 2021, Trouble For Bitcoin?","On-chain data shows that altcoin volume dominance is now at the highest level since January 2021, while Bitcoin’s is at its lowest. Altcoin Dominance By Volume Recently Touched A High Of 64% As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, Bitcoin’s dominance is just at 16% now. The “dominance by volume” is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total crypto market trading volume that’s being contributed by a specific coin. When the value of this metric goes up for any crypto, it means that particular crypto is observing a higher amount of activity relative to the rest of the market currently. This suggests that the coin is garnering more interest from investors right now. On the other hand, low values can imply that the crypto is losing mindshare at the moment as its volume percentage is going down. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the dominance by volume for the entire altcoin sector combined (minus Ethereum), as well as for Bitcoin, over the past couple of years: The two metrics seem to have gone opposite ways in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, Bitcoin’s dominance by volume has sharply decreased recently and has touched a value of just 16%. This is the lowest value BTC has observed during the last couple of years. The altcoins (other than Ethereum), on the contrary, have observed their dominance shoot up in the last week or so, as the metric now has a value of 64%. This suggests that BTC has lost its market share to these alts recently. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $34.7M In SHIB From Binance The quant finds this trend “very concerning,” however. The reason behind that is the fact that whenever rallies have kicked off with altcoins being on top, they haven’t usually lasted for too long, and the prices have quickly come back down. This can be very clearly seen in the chart. For example, the tops of both the bull rallies of 2021 (the ones in the first and second half of the year) took formation while the altcoins had a higher trading volume dominance than Bitcoin. The latest FTX crash also took place while alts were dominating the market. It would appear that generally any sustainable and healthy price rallies have only started with the dominance of BTC being higher than these alts. One prominent example is that the July 2021 bottom, which kicked off the second-half bull run of 2021, took place with the Bitcoin volume percentage being higher than altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Currently More Stable Than Gold, DXY, Nasdaq, Here’s What Could Happen Next The entire market has been rallying in the last week, but if the historical pattern is anything to go by, this uplift may not last too long as the dominance of altcoins is at very high levels right now.

7404314,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515746,1673451052,Bitcoin Reaches One-Month High As Mini Bull Run Continues,"The crypto market has evolved from the unending devastating bear market to a more green and overwhelming market. Cryptocurrencies are moving from the initial stagnant, and lower lows state to a rallying to the top. Among the number of cryptocurrencies moving upward and making significant higher highs is Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap. So far, Bitcoin has broken multiple resistance and continued in a bullish trend carrying the whole crypto market with it. Bitcoin Taps Above $17,000 For The First Time In One Month Since the FTX crash happened and the bear market deepened, we saw Bitcoin crashing to lower lows and slipping below the 17,000 zones. After it fell below that, Bitcoin stayed there for a long while. However, over the past few weeks since the new year began, the Bitcoin market has been making some positive moves. After ranging around the $16,000 zone from late last year, Bitcoin tapped into and above $17,000 for the first in almost a month, trading at $17,500. Tuesday was when BTC made a significant move of about 1.5%, the highest daily gain since December 20, 2022. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Whales Go On 20,000 BTC Buying Spree And since Bitcoin tapped into the $17,000 zone, the coin hasn’t budged or even fallen out of that zone. However, it has lost a couple of hundred dollars and now trades at $17,409 at the time of writing. Despite the retrace, its market capitalization is still above $335 billion, which is higher than the market cap seen on BTC late last year. BTC Begins To Lose Dominance Though Bitcoin is still considered the big dog among cryptocurrencies, it’s beginning to lose its dominance against altcoins in the crypto space as whale investors have registered low participation in the BTC market. According to the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, altcoin trading volume dominance is now above 50% as opposed to Bitcoin’s 39% dominance. Maartunn, a contributor to CryptoQuant, wrote in a blog post, “Usually when traders get bored on BTC, they start trading altcoins which are, in general, further on the risk curve. This makes them very fragile and easy to squeeze.” He added, “altcoin dominance is again above 50%. Be aware: when altcoins continue to dominate, there is a potential risk for further downside,” he added. Furthermore, according to a recent report from Arcane Research, BTC’s 30-day volatility has plummeted to June 2020 levels as the asset has been trading relatively flat with low volatility through the first 10 days of 2023, making it even more stable than gold, the dollar strength index, Nasdaq, and the S&P500 measured through 5-day volatility. Related Reading: Analysts Recommend: Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Meanwhile, with altcoins gaining more dominance, large investors are now turning to assets other than BTC. Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) have made significant moves over the past 7 days, with three of them up by over 50% combined.

However, decentralized finance (DeFi) still has growing pains due, in part, to fragmentation across multiple blockchains – a problem addressed through interoperability-focused protocols.  Quasar Finance, a decentralized asset management protocol using the Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) technology released by the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem, has raised $5.4 million in a funding round led by Shima Capital at a $70 million valuation. The protocol allows users to create and join vaults, or independent asset containers capable of connecting tokens and data transfers between chains.  Other investors in the round included Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital, HASH Capital, CIB and Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal, among others. The capital will go toward product development and scaling out the team, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  Quasar plans to offer structured investment products for DeFi, starting with an automatically rebalancing index of the Cosmos ecosystem that supports the staking of assets. After months of private testing, Quasar will open its public testnet on Feb. 10.  “Securing this funding given ongoing and difficult market conditions is a massive show of confidence and a significant reaffirmation of our partners commitment to the common goal – making non-custodial and permissionless asset management available to all,” said Quasar co-founder and CEO Valentin Pletnev in the press release.

Ondo estimated the regulated products could attract more than $100 billion in stablecoins that currently may not be earning yields for their holders.  On Ondo’s site, the OUSG fund invests in short-term government Treasurys, earning 4.2% per annum; the OSTB invests in short-term bonds, earning 5.45% per annum; and OYHG invests in high-yield corporate bonds, paying out 8% per annum to depositors. Fees for these funds are currently listed at 0.15%.  The funds deposited on Ondo will further be invested in relevant exchange-traded funds offered by BlackRock and Pimco. Coinbase Custody will custody any stablecoins the fund holds, while Coinbase Prime will handle conversions between stablecoins and fiat.  The so-termed “blue chip” DeFi protocols such as Compound and Aave yield about 1%-2% per year by investing in liquidity pools belonging to projects based on blockchains such as Ethereum or Solana.  Newer uncollateralized lending protocols, on the other hand, offer yields in the 7%-10% APR range, but these loans have been “experiencing higher-than-expected default rates” and are proving to be less transparent and riskier than many traditional bonds with comparable yields, according to Ondo.  “Large stablecoin holders, including start-ups and [decentralized autonomous organizations], are faced with a choice between having their purchasing power eroded away by inflation or taking too much risk with the current set of on-chain yield offerings,"" Nathan Allman, founder of Ondo Finance, said in a post.  The funds will process daily subscriptions and redemptions in stablecoins as well as traditional fiat, and investors will receive tokens on the Ethereum blockchain representing their ownership.  Over the past few years, crypto protocols such as Terra and several others advertised yields of over 20% that attracted billions in dollars from crypto hopefuls. These products eventually imploded because the model was unsustainable and often depended on printing token “rewards” that had no intrinsic value.  Ondo’s new offering also highlights a growing trend of bringing traditional, so-called real-world assets (RWA) such as bonds, real estate and consumer credit to the blockchain, an effort spearheaded by DeFi giant MakerDAO and lending protocols including Credix and Goldfinch.  Tokenized RWA investment products let cryptocurrency owners get exposure to rising yields in traditional financial markets without exiting the digital asset ecosystem.  Analysts predicted in their outlook for 2023 that integrating real world assets into decentralized finance will be one of the key themes in crypto.

7402297,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515730,1673447456,"Crypto Market Will See A Bloodbath If Ripple Loses To SEC, Gasparino Says","In recent days, a heated discussion has arisen between prominent journalist and Fox Business host Charles Gasparino and the Ripple / XRP community. Gasparino voiced that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had legitimate reasons why they targeted and sued Ripple prior to FTX. Even Ripple’s legal counsel Stuart Alderoty took a stand and rejected the arguments, as Bitcoinist reported. Meanwhile, the Fox Business host did clarify that he has no idea who will win the lawsuit. He even admitted that the judge’s comments “initially indicated she would side with Ripple,” but at the same time, he warned that this was before the “whole SBF FTX implosion.” Ripple Victory Is Crucial For The Entire Crypto Industry In his two most recent tweets, Gasparino paints a dark future scenario for the broader crypto market and shared his view on what consequences the industry could face if the SEC wins against Ripple. Gasparino wrote via Twitter: Crypto community sees a bloodbath if SEC prevails against Ripple in the form of more regs/oversight that will impact nearly every sector including the exchange biz given Gary Gensler’s desire to force registration of every coin but BTC. Gasparino is not entirely alone in this opinion either. Even Ripple has expressed in previous statements that the company is fighting not just for itself, but the entire crypto industry, to avoid an overreaching regulation by the SEC. Related Reading: XRP Price Primed For Future Rally Following Ripple’s MENA Expansion Noteworthy is also Gasparino’s latest tweet which refers to the largest American crypto exchange. The journalist asserts that Coinbase is already developing a plan to survive a regulatory crackdown by the SEC: Coinbase tells Fox Business it’s developing a plan to survive an SEC regulatory crackdown on digital assets using broker-dealers to trade coins registered as securities. Move comes as SEC case v Ripple looms; SEC win could force coins aside from BTC to register. What Might A Bloodbath Look Like For The Crypto Market? The Fox Business host does not define what he means by a bloodbath. However, a look at history helps to understand the thesis. When the SEC sued Ripple on December 22, 2020, the price dropped a whopping 68% in one week. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently down 74.74% and 72.62% from their all-time highs, respectively, XRP is 89.31% below its all-time high of $3.40, which was reached on January 07, 2018. Thus, XRP is showing significant underperformance. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Bulls Could Aim $0.4 or Higher The outcome of the court battle remains on the razor’s edge, with the XRP community, of course, seeing plenty of arguments in favor of a Ripple victory. In a recent blog post, Ripple’s general counsel Stuart Alderoty revealed that he expects a – positive – outcome for the lawsuit in the second quarter of 2023. At press time, the XRP price was trading at $0.3640. With yesterday’s upward movement, XRP was able to break through the key resistance at $0.3560. This opens up the possibility to attack the next resistance at $0.3740, possibly as early as tomorrow, Thursday, when the CPI data for December is released.

There's still a sum missing in what is owed to customers and the amount is still unclear, the attorney said.  ""We have located over $5 billion of cash, liquid cryptocurrency and liquid investment securities measured at petition date value. [It] just does not ascribe any value to holdings of dozens of illiquid cryptocurrency tokens, where our holdings are so large relative to the total supply that our positions cannot be sold without substantially affecting the market for the token,"" said Landis Rath & Cobb attorney Adam Landis on FTX's behalf.  The announcement substantially raises the total FTX claims it holds, after the company's new leadership said it could only find just over $1 billion on Dec. 20, 2022. The total amount FTX owes its creditors is still unclear. In initial bankruptcy filings, the company's management checked off the box indicating a figure between $1 billion and $10 billion.  Sam Bankman-Fried instructed his lieutenant, Gary Wang, to create a ""backdoor"" for Alameda to borrow from FTX customers without their permission, Landis said. He added the former CEO created a line of credit worth $65 billion from the exchange to the trading arm.  ""We know what Alameda did with the money. It bought planes, houses, threw parties, made political donations. It made personal loans to its founders. It sponsored the FTX Arena in Miami, a Formula One team, the League of Legends, Coachella and many other businesses, events and personalities,"" Landis said.  He added that this has led to a ""shortfall in value"" to repay customers and creditors.  ""The amount of the shortfall is not yet clear. It will depend on the size of the claims pool and our recovery efforts. But every week we come closer to completing the work necessary to estimate recoveries for the purposes of a plan of reorganization,"" Landis said.  Chief Financial Officer Mary Cilia estimated in December the company could complete that work by April. However, Judge John Dorsey of the Delaware Bankruptcy Court set a March 15 deadline in Wednesday's hearing. Brian Glueckstein of Sullivan & Cromwell said there may be as many as 9 million creditors, echoing a figure made by Kevin Cofsky, a partner with Parella Weinberg Partners, a financial advisory firm.  Landis also spoke about a recently announced cooperation agreement with the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, saying it was ""an important first step to align incentives and maximize joint recoveries.""  ""It does not matter who collects $1 for customers, as long as the customers get it,"" Landis said. ""We've established a task force with the official committee of creditors and the Bahamas JPL to explore alternatives for the sale or reorganization of the international platform.""

He downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral and cut his price target to $35 from $50.  Kupferberg’s downgrade comes after COIN’s near-30% rally to start 2023. The downgrade likely helped send the shares lower by 3.6% to $41.68 before the stock market open.  The stock’s gain this year comes after a decline of more than 80% in 2022, thanks in part to a 5% bounce in the price of bitcoin (BTC). In addition, Coinbase announced on Tuesday its intention to reduce headcount by about 20% as part of a restructuring because of the ongoing crypto winter.  Though management’s moves are “encouraging” and “nimble,” said Kupferberg, his team is cutting its revenue forecast for 2023 after its analysis of fourth-quarter crypto transaction volume data prompted a “murky at best” outlook for this year.  Given the “volatile crypto environment,” he said, the shares are likely to struggle should the consensus estimate be revised lower.

The members of the U.K. Forum for Digital Currencies (UK FDC) include the City of London Corporation,Digital Pound Foundation, The Payments Association and lobby groups TheCityUK and UK Finance.  The U.K.'s Financial Services and Markets Bill, which is set to give regulators in the country more power to regulate crypto, including stablecoins, is set to pass by April. Plus, the U.K. government wants to launch a consultation in the coming weeks regarding what other regulations need to be put in place for the sector. Policy makers have been calling for more regulation following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  The group also wants to help further the U.K.'s ambition to be a crypto hub, the statement said. It plans to both mitigate actual risks plus alleviate the perceived risks of crypto through education and will facilitate discussions between the financial services industry and crypto.  ""While there are risks, the U.K. FDC recognises this growing interest and the adoption of new forms of digital money across the globe and how it will open many opportunities for the U.K. to remain competitive in FinTech, while leading financial innovation with the right regulatory framework,"" the statement said.

Wood's investment firm ARK added 33,726 COIN shares to its Innovation ETF, worth around $1.45 million. The buy follows much larger ones in December when ARK added more than 450,000 shares across two purchases. COIN lost around 86% of its value in 2022, but it is now showing signs of recovery, up 20% on the week and 7.3% on the month. The Nasdaq-listed Coinbase announced Tuesday it was cutting 950 jobs – around 20% of its workforce – in a bid to bring down its operating expenses by 25% by the end of March. The move was welcomed by Wall Street analysts, who viewed it as a sign the firm was showing fiscal discipline.  According to the Indian crypto exchange WazirX's proof-of-reserves report, over 90% of its users' assets are in Binance wallets. The report showed that $259 million of the exchange's $285 million in assets were held in Binance wallets, with a further $26.5 million in other exchanges. Therefore, the validity of WazirX funds depends on Binance honoring liquidations, highlighting the dangers of the frosty relations between the two firms. Binance announced that it had agreed to acquire WazirX in 2019, but in August WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty had a Twitter spat with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao over who controls the exchange. Shetty has previously said the two firms have been in talks to clear up the ownership issue.  Binance.US's bid to purchase the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital got a boost Tuesday after a judge gave his approval to disclosure statements explaining the proposed deal. Another confirmation hearing will follow in March and the deal will also require approval from Voyager's creditors. Voyager's legal representatives said they had ""resolved for the purposes of today"" objections raised by the likes of the Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators, demonstrating that Binance.US has the dry powder to pay debtors up to $35 million in cash.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows U.S. financial conditions have eased for the first time since April, contradicting the Federal Reserve's restrictive policy stance aimed at controlling inflation.  Financial conditions ease when bond yields drop, credit spreads narrow, the dollar weakens and stock prices rally.  The latest easing shows the markets are not buying the Fed's narrative that interest rates will be raised above 5% and held there for a long time.  – Omkar Godbole     Trending Posts  Crypto Industry Hopes Turn to French Legislators as Regulators Back Mandatory License  Now I Know the Cryptocurrency Industry Is Here to Stay  A New Philosophy of Markets: Assets That Embody Technology",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,"Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/11/first-mover-americas-cme-btc-futures-signal-worst-of-ftx-induced-panic-may-be-over,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54b71d85d0dbb124582f613c69992652b5c286b4-933x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin 5-Day Volatility Has Fallen Below That Of Gold, DXY, Nasdaq, And S&P 500 According to the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, BTC has been more stable than these assets for a record duration already this year. The “volatility” is an indicator that measures the deviation of daily returns from the average for Bitcoin. When the value of this metric is high, it means the crypto has been registering a higher amount of returns compared to the mean, suggesting that the coin has involved a higher trading risk recently. On the other hand, low values imply there haven’t been any significant fluctuations in the price in recent days, showing that the market has been stale. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day volatility for Bitcoin over the course of its entire history: The value of the metric seems to have plunged in recent days | Source: Arcane Research's Ahead of the Curve - January 10 As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin 30-day volatility is at very low levels currently as the price has been trading mostly sideways in recent weeks. The current values of the indicator are the lowest since 2020, but they are still higher than some of the lows during previous bear markets. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $34.7M In SHIB From Binance One consequence of this recent flat movement has been that BTC has become more stable than assets like gold, DXY, Nasdaq, and S&P 500. To compare these assets’ volatilities against each other, the report has made use of the 5-day volatility (and not the 30-day or 7-day one). The below table highlights the periods in BTC’s lifetime when the crypto’s 5-day volatility has been simultaneously lower than all these traditional assets. Looks like such occurrences have been a very rare event | Source: Arcane Research's Ahead of the Curve - January 10 As the table displays, there have only ever been a handful of instances where the Bitcoin 5-day volatility has been lower than that of gold, DXY, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 at the same time. The report labels such occurrences as “relative volatility compression” periods. It seems like, before the latest streak, the highest duration of this trend was just 2 consecutive days. This means that the current relative volatility compression period is already the longest ever in the coin’s history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Fall To 2020 Levels As Activity Remains Low Another interesting fact in the table is the total returns in Bitcoin that were observed in the 30-day period following the first date of the volatility compression in each of these instances. Besides one occurrence (September 29, 2022), all other volatility compression periods were succeeded by the price becoming highly volatile and registering large returns. It now remains to be seen whether a similar pattern will follow this time as well, with Bitcoin experiencing a wild next 30 days after this seriously flat price action.

FTX will ask a judge in Delaware to approve a process for selling affiliates Embed, LedgerX, FTX Europe, and FTX Japan as it seeks to raise funds for customers, who have lost potentially billions of dollars, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing court documents. The four FTX affiliates are relatively independent from the parent, with each having segregated customers accounts and separate management teams, the filings said. It has not committed to selling any of the firms, but has received unsolicited offers, FTX said. The company expects that scheduling auctions in February or March would result in additional bids. The U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy watchdog that is part of the U.S. Department of Justice, has opposed the unit sales before an extensive investigation into the extent of fraud allegedly perpetrated by ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried can be carried out. The company also requested to keep its customer names undisclosed for at least six months as it could expose them to scams and violate privacy laws, while at the same time adversely affect FTX's value as it searches for buyers, Reuters said. Media companies, such as the New York Times , and the U.S. Trustee object to keeping the names secret.

Monday's tweet that the company was working with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Mark Wahlberg helped lift GALA over 70% to about 5 U.S. cents, the highest since Sept. 13, CoinDesk data show. Gala Games deleted the tweet without any explanation, and the token is now more than 20% lower at nearly 4 cents.  ""We are, as you’re reading this, developing two films with the Rock (aka Dwayne Johnson) and Mark Wahlberg! Two absolutely huge forces in the entertainment industry. You’ve seen their work on screen, but I think their presence might be even more powerful off the screen and we are so happy to get the chance to work with them,"" the now-deleted tweet said, according to an image posted on Discord.  The tweet added that, under the partnership, users within the Gala ecosystem would be able to scan a QR code to buy movie tickets for The Rock's movies and win digital prizes on Netflix.  CoinDesk reached out to Gala Games, and a representative responded several hours later by email noting that Gala's CEO had recently shared news about plans the company has for the coming year, including moving into mobile gaming.  ""The narrative around the increase in Gala token being linked to the 'announcement' of the Hollywood names is false,"" according to the representative.  The representative added that ""both The Rock’s company, Seven Bucks, and Mark’s company, Unrealistic Ideas, have contracts for films with Gala.""  ""The announcement post was meant to be a closed post for the Discord community and wasn't supposed to be shared in a public place,"" according to the Gala representative. ""It was also part of a larger conversation in Discord about where Gala Film was headed. Gala took the tweet down out of respect to all involved partners but we look forward to sharing more about these projects in the near future.""  The matter nevertheless quickly drew the attention of crypto enthusiasts on Twitter, with several handles questioning the genuineness of the initial announcement. They called for shorting, or taking investment positions that bet on a decline in, the cryptocurrency.  The funding rates in the perpetual futures market tied to the GALA token were profoundly negative early Wednesday, indicating a bearish bias in the market.  Paid every eight hours, funding rates refer to the cost of holding bullish long or bearish short positions. A negative figure implies shorts are paying longs to keep the position open and the leverage is skewed on the bearish side.  ""Gala’s [perpetual] funding rate trades deeply negative, a sign that some traders expect prices to resume lower in the near future. If not, then we could see a lot of short covering as perp open interest has exploded,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, said.  GALA still leads the rally in gaming tokens  Despite the pullback, GALA is still up over 130% for the month, leading the rally among gaming tokens.  Ethereum-based virtual reality gaming platform The Sandbox's SAND has risen in value by 30%, while Decentraland's MANA has gained 22%. Other notable gaming coins with double-digit gains are play-to-earn giant Axie Inifinity's AXS token, Yield Guild Games' YGG and Illuvium's ILV tokens.  GALA's performance is noteworthy, considering its triple-digit rally outshines the 80% surge in LDO, the governance token of liquid staking giant Lido Finance. LDO topped the list of best-performing cryptocurrencies with a market value above $1 billion. Market leaders bitcoin and ether have chalked up a meager 5% and 11% gains.  The uptick in gaming tokens, a high-risk subsector that took center stage during the tail end of the 2021 bull market, perhaps indicates a risk revival in the crypto market.

The watchdog plans to propose a subset of tokens that will be approved, the CEO of SFC, Julia Leung, said at a panel discussion at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong.  Leung said only ""highly liquid"" assets will be on the list, according to a report by the South China Morning Post.  Hong Kong's virtual asset service provider regime will be focused on investor protection, the importance of which was hammered home by the collapse of FTX in November, according to Leung. The failed crypto exchange was once headquartered in Hong Kong.  ""Virtual assets have in the past year gone from peak to low [price] levels. The good thing is that when the froth is taken out from the system as platforms and some tokens collapsed, it focuses investors and sellers' minds on investor protection,"" Leung said.  Signals out of Hong Kong on the territory's aspirations for its crypto regime have been mixed in recent months.  Hong Kong was showing signs of relaxing tough regulations to become a more crypto-friendly environment at times last year. The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau said in October that it was open to allowing retail customers to trade cryptocurrency or approving a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF).  However, in November, Leung - then the deputy CEO of the SFC - called for tough rules to be implemented on crypto firms, saying how FTX's collapse had highlighted the volatility of digital assets and the threat posed by its links with traditional financial services.

42410858,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsCQH,1673439300,Ethereum Upgrade Could Make It Harder to Lose All Your Crypto,"Ethereum developers are hard at work trying to make its blockchain more user-friendly.  One of the downfalls of crypto is the costliness of simple screw-ups. For instance, if a user loses the keys to their crypto account, they could lose access to their crypto holdings forever. In the face of this and other potential pitfalls, it’s vastly easier to lose your money in crypto than in traditional banking.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Blockchain developers increasingly recognize that human error is an inevitability, meaning it will be difficult to push crypto into the mainstream without fail-safes and better ease of use. One of those innovations is a concept called “Account Abstraction.”  Account Abstraction (AA) aims to use smart contracts to execute crypto transactions, by creating certain validity rules. With AA, users won’t need to sign off on every transaction with one’s private keys.  “We're going to be at a point in the future where using an Ethereum account, it's going to be just as simple as using a bank,” said Kristof Gazso, a co-author for an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) on AA. “People won't have to make that trade off of like, ‘Hey, you know, I like decentralization, but also, it's a pain in the ass to use Ethereum.’”  Ultimately, through AA, developers want to make Ethereum as usable as a traditional fiat bank account, so users can make transactions more easily, program automatic bill payments and more.  But before understanding how AA could change the nature of how one may use crypto, it's important to understand how Ethereum transactions operate today.  Accounts on Ethereum: EOAs and CAs  On Ethereum, users have the ability to create two types of accounts: External Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts (CA). The two account types differ in terms of how they initiate transactions over Ethereum’s network.  EOA’s, the typical account-type for Ethereum users, are the type of account you use if you have used a wallet provider such as MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.  With an EOA, users are given a pair of keys: a public and a private key. Anyone can send funds to an EOA using its public key. But only the account’s owner – whoever has access to the account’s private key, which should be kept secret – can actually initiate transactions from the account.  CAs, better known as “smart contracts,” are like mini computer programs that live on the Ethereum network. These accounts are controlled by code – not private keys – but they cannot initiate transactions themselves; an EOA needs to send a transaction (which you can think of like a message or instruction) to a CA in order for it to make transactions of its own.  Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet: What Is a Crypto Wallet and How to Use It  The problem with EOAs comes down to human error. “One key has complete admin control over your account,” said Gazso, the co-author of the EIP 4337. “If you lose it, too bad, you've lost all control over your account forever.”  If you lose a private key to an EOA account, there is no help desk or key recovery process (like a “password reset” button) that can help you regain access to your funds.  “Humans are the biggest security flaw in Ethereum account management,” Gazso added. While there’s no concrete data on how much ETH is lost due to forgotten keys, Bitcoin accounts use a similar private key system to that on Ethereum. According to a Chainalysis report, up to 23% of all bitcoins in circulation (or around 3.79 million BTC) could be lost forever because of forgotten keys.  And forgotten keys aren't the only problem. If someone (think, hackers) gets their hands on a person’s private key, they gain complete control over that person’s funds.  How does Account Abstraction work?  Account Abstraction addresses the shortcomings of EOAs by merging them with CAs – allowing people to create user accounts with built-in fail-safe mechanisms and other special features for verifying transactions.  As Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin described in a 2021 blog post, “instead of [smart contract code] just being used to implement the logic of applications, it would also be used to implement the verification logic (nonces, signatures…) of individual users’ wallets”  Under account abstraction, user accounts could be programmed to include social recovery systems where several people – each with a key of their own – have the ability to return an account to its owner should the owner lose access to the private key.  One could also create “multisig wallets” that hand account ownership over to a group – requiring multiple different parties to sign off on transactions as a sort of extra layer of security.  Accounts under AA could also avoid some of the other hard-coded limitations of EOAs. They could, for instance, define how users pay gas fees. Currently, under EOAs on Ethereum, users have to pay gas in ether (ETH). But with AA one can choose to use a different cryptocurrency to pay gas with (like DOGE), or you can assign someone else (like a parent or friend) to pay gas fees.  All of these systems are possible to implement today using CAs, but with a significant degree of complexity and overhead (i.e., gas costs) due to the requirement that all transactions are initiated by an EOA.  How to achieve full implementation of Account Abstraction?  There are a bunch of proposals that aim to add AA to Ethereum, with the most prominent being EIP-4337. “It really is the first proposal which achieves Account Abstraction without requiring a hard fork,” Gazso said.  The key advantage of EIP-4337 is that implementing it won’t require any changes to Ethereum’s core protocol. The proposal would just add a new account abstraction layer atop Ethereum’s core protocol – enabling wallet providers to create user-owned accounts that use smart contracts to set the rules for initiating transactions.  So if all these tools are currently available, why isn’t account abstraction more widespread?  The answer to that is momentum. It’s obviously not easy to build a new wallet, launch it and ship it to people. “Convincing people to try out new technology, new wallets, is a very difficult task,” Gazso added. That is why people who do initially start their crypto journey turn to something that has been around longer or that has been battle-tested, like a MetaMask wallet.  So finding people to implement these new technologies seems to be the biggest bottleneck for account abstraction. But the tide for that seems to be changing.  What’s cooking with Account Abstraction?  Some layer 2s on Ethereum are leading the way to natively integrate AA. StarkWare, the company behind the StarkNet blockchain, is already live with Account Abstraction. Eli Ben-Sasson, the co-founder and president of StarkWare, told CoinDesk that Account Abstraction could be used in the future to “use your facial recognition or biometrics to basically authorize [crypto] payments,” sort of like how FaceID can activate credit card payments for iPhone users. “The infrastructure for doing this is now possible on Starknet,” Ben-Sasson added.  Last month, Visa also announced its proposal to eventually use Account Abstraction to deploy automatic payments with StarkNet infrastructure. This would emulate automatic payments in a bank account to pay bills, except now it could be done on the blockchain.  Read more: Visa Proposes Automatic Payments Using Ethereum Layer 2 System StarkNet  Other firms, such as Gnosis Chain, are looking to integrate Account Abstraction into their infrastructure. Gnosis Chain co-founder Stefan George told CoinDesk: “Slowly, interest in AA is increasing as more and more developers and users become aware of the potential.”  Gazso reiterated that 2023 will be “the year for Account Abstraction,” noting that it is currently one of the most widely discussed topics in the ecosystem.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | FORKS,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/11/ethereum-upgrade-could-make-it-harder-to-lose-all-your-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e9777b225a121f919a8d7e8032ca18462de7e87-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413153,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7zrC,1673438301,FTX Creditor Claims Going for 13 Cents on the Dollar on Bankruptcy Marketplace Xclaim,"The $91.7 million in FTX creditor claims listed on the claims trading marketplace Xclaim will likely get around 13 cents on the dollar, according to data released by the site.  This is in contrast to the much higher prices that failed companies Voyager Digital, BlockFi and Celsius Network are getting, with claims trading at 41 cents, 28.5 cents and 18.5 cents, respectively.  According to Xclaim’s chief strategy officer, Andrew Glantz, this discount is occurring because there’s less public information available about the claims.  “Part of that is because most creditors, most account holders, still can’t access their accounts even to provide a basic screenshot of what their account looks like. It becomes harder to verify that they are actually owed,” Glantz said to CoinDesk in an interview. “That’s much easier in Celsius and Voyager where creditors, even if their funds are frozen, can at least access their account, take a screenshot, provide account details and get a buyer comfortable that their claim is a valid claim.”  Despite this, Glantz says there remains interest in FTX creditor claims, and around 80 new buyers have been onboarded in the last month as a result. This pool of buyers includes hedge funds and specialized traders that are “generally well known in the restructuring community.”  As Xclaim is a marketplace and the prices are dynamic, the current 13 cents to 13.5 cents for the FTX claims are reflective of the market’s belief of how easy this case will be to resolve.  “You’ve got competing interests from BlockFi to [Sam Bankman-Fried] to creditors arguing over who owns Robinhood shares and the government going and taking possession of those,” Glantz told CoinDesk, predicting that this case could be before the courts for a decade. “With all of these little skirmishes, each one of those shifts potentially shifts value from one group of creditors to another group of creditors.”  The sellers of the claims – while anonymous – are heavily focused in Asia. Glantz said that half are from Singapore, 15% from China and 23% from Taiwan. Taiwan had some of the highest per-capita losses on FTX, given Taiwanese attraction to FTX’s high interest on U.S. dollar deposits.  Also included is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which will present a number of challenges given its governance structure.  Xclaim isn’t the only market facilitating the buying and selling of FTX creditor claims. Shortly after the exchange’s bankruptcy, Cherokee Acquisition, which operates a similar marketplace, started offering trades at 8 cents to 12 cents on the dollar.  Thomas Braziel, a managing partner at distressed corporate specialist 507 Capital, told CoinDesk at the time that these prices weren’t realistic, and 3 cents to 5 cents would be where the market has an interest.

42413169,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl803M,1673434571,Solana-Based Bonk Inu NFTs Surge Tenfold After Mint but Listing Attracts Criticism,"Prices of Bonkz non-fungible tokens (NFT) have surged 10 times since their initial mint on Tuesday, attracting over $900,000 in trading volume after all 15,000 collectibles were sold.  Over 6,165 individual wallets hold these collectibles at writing time, data from Solana marketplace Magic Eden shows. The collectibles are based on the popular Shiba Inu-themed Solana project Bonk Inu, which did not directly take part in Bonkz’s creation.  The NFTs, which are digital tokens that represent ownership of a physical or virtual asset, may help further BONK’s usage on Solana's network. BONK has attracted massive transaction volume and hype in the past week.  The Bonkz collectibles are purely art-based and with no imminent plans for utility, its creators told CoinDesk yesterday. Pricing for the mint – a term that refers to the initial issuance of any NFT – was $25 worth of BONK, and secondary trading will be transacted with solana (SOL) tokens.  Each NFT sells for over $280 worth of solana at writing time. All BONK used to purchase these NFTs were burnt – a term referring to when tokens are permanently taken out of supply – meaning over $250,000 worth of bonk’s token supply was removed from circulation on Tuesday.  As such, a certain feature of the NFT attracted criticism among community members.  Magic Eden said it had utilized its Open Creator Protocol (OCP) for the mint, which enforces royalties on all collections that adopt the protocol and allows creators to ban marketplaces that have not enforced royalties on their collection.  “We utilized OCP for this mint, so any transfers between wallets should be done on Magic Eden in ""My Items"" versus directly in wallet,” a note on Bonkz listing on Magic Eden said. This effectively means Bonkz will not be listed on marketplaces that don’t kick back royalties to the creators.  That move attracted brickbats from the Bonk Inu community, including its developers. “BONK is meant to be open source for everyone to build upon. We are disappointed to see an exchange limit trading using OCP,” developers said in a Wednesday tweet, adding they working out a solution to tackle the apparent centralized approach.  Bonkz’s creators also acknowledged the seeming lapse, stating they were “actively working with all parties.”  Meanwhile, the price of the BONK token remained unchanged over the past 24 hours and is down nearly 70% from its peak.",NEUTRAL,SOL | BONK,BLOCKCHAIN | SHIB | SOL | TRADING | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/11/solana-based-bonk-inu-nfts-surge-tenfold-after-mint-but-listing-attracts-criticism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5149ee3f3ce091cfcd6fc5ef2602bd890c801554-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7394471,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515695,1673433035,Litecoin Price Could Rally 285% Pre-Halving Based On Historical Data,"While the Bitcoin halving is not expected until March 13, 2024, according to Coinwarz data, Litecoin investors can already look forward to the traditionally bullish event as soon as this year. According to NiceHash’s estimate, the Litecoin halving will take place in 189 days, on July 19, 2023. The approaching halving has prompted analyst Rekt Capital to examine Litecoin’s historical price trends before and after the halving in order to provide a prediction for the coming months. 285% Litecoin Rally In The Cards? Rekt Capital notes that LTC tends to rally quite a lot before halving. Before halving 1, the price bottomed in 122 days and rose +820% afterward. Before halving 2, LTC bottomed in 243 days and rallied by 550%. After both halvings, however, the price gains were even stronger. As the chart below from Rekt Capital shows, Litecoin is up +14,200% after the first halving, and after the second halving, it was “still” 1,574%. From this, the analyst derives the historical tendency that LTC tends to rally stronger after the halving than before. However, this does not mean that investing before the halving is not historically lucrative if you find the right time to place a sell order. According to the analyst, it can be seen from historical data that LTC sees a strong rally prior to the halving before the price drops sharply immediately. Related Reading: Ol’ Reliable Litecoin Up By 7% As LTC Flexes Muscles For 2023 The Litecoin price declined by -73% in the first 578 days after halving. The second halving led the price to drop as much as -83% before it found its bottom after 458 days. “For that reason it’s important to understand when an LTC pre-halving rally tends to top,” the analyst says. As the chart below shows, LTC peaked 31 days before the event the first time and 61 days before the second occasion. Provided this trend continues, the LTC rally could stop as early as 92 days pre-halving – which would be in May 2023, according to Rekt Capital. However, the rally could also end as early as April if the days double. It is therefore also interesting to scrutinize how long the rallies lasted in terms of time. The first LTC pre-halving rally lasted for just 90 days, while the second provided a good 180 days of excitement among investors. Therefore, the analyst concludes: It looks like $LTC pre-halving rallies may be lengthening in time. If this upcoming LTC Pre-Halving rally lasts twice as long as the previous PH rally, then this rally will last ~365 days. Which finds confluence with a May 2023 top. In terms of how much the LTC price could rise in the months leading up to halving, the analyst believes that the rally could propel the price as high as 285% from its bottom. Such a rally would mean that LTC has already captured certain pre-halving gains and could push up to the $115 zone. This is also the point where the pre-halving 2019 rally peaked. LTC also briefly held support at this level after its 2021 bull market high to form the macro downtrend. What Happens After The Halving? Post-halving, LTC could face a strong retracement based on historical trends before an accumulation phase begins. The lows in both cases were higher lows compared to the pre-halving low. This could mean that LTC will fall between 72% and 77%. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Data Shows Weak Baseline For 2023: Report The key is to “watch for deep post-halving retrace followed by long consolidation in an approx 70%-wide range,” the analyst explained. The breakout from the accumulation phase could occur after at least 400 days post-halving in July 2023, according to the (still short) history. In conclusion, Rekt Capital says: This would coincide with a July 2024 LTC breakout. This would make sense as this #LTC breakout would occur after the 2024 Bitcoin Halving: It would also tie in with BTC’s general trend reversal which occurs in a typical Candle 4 in the four year cycle. At press time, the LTC price was up 1.5% in the last 24 hours, trading at $82.43.

Creditors of the bankrupt crypto lender are seeking to avoid a situation seen in the case of Celsius Network – where the financial details of hundreds of thousands of users were published as part of standard judicial procedure.  Andrew Vara, a U.S. Department of Justice official responsible for bankruptcy cases, argued in a separate Tuesday filing to the New Jersey bankruptcy court that “disclosure is a basic premise of bankruptcy law” needed to avoid any suggestion of impropriety – echoing arguments he has previously made in the case of collapsed crypto exchange FTX.  A committee of BlockFi creditors said that giving away a valuable client list for free would reduce the value of the estate – and that publication would make clients vulnerable to theft, noting that even experienced Bitcoin developers such as Luke Dashr can be the subject of hacks.  In the case of FTX, the motion to publish the creditor list – which has been supported by media companies including Bloomberg and the New York Times – will be considered at a court hearing in Delaware later on Wednesday, Jan. 11.

Image: Polkadot Insider/Twitter Connecting The DOTs Polkadot released a blog post rounding up the developments on the ecosystem last year and it is impressive nonetheless. Even with the strong grip of the bear market, Polkadot has over 550 projects running on-chain or are being developed on the ecosystem. With over 71 parachains on Polkadot, development will continue even in the midst of the bear market. Chart: Santiment This can be seen in the development activity on-chain which skyrocketed with the start of the year. Polkadot also scored major partnerships with Japan phone operator NTT Docomo and video game company Square Enix, further strengthening the ecosystem’s Web3 infrastructure. But positive revenues, booming dev activity, and major tie-ups could have no big effect on DOT’s price, despite its latest weekly ascent. The token has not broken its sluggish pace which started in May last year. This downtrend, if not altered this year, will eventually lead the token to retest its support at $4. Polkadot ‘Sucker Rally’ As of writing, the token is changing hands at $4.8 which is not a far cry from the $5 resistance that halted any bullish run for DOT. According to crypto analyst Market Mobster, the rally that DOT has experienced is just what they call a “sucker rallys.” Some $DOT analysis Be careful of these types of ‘suckers rallys’ As much as I love @Polkadot I’m not adding to my bag here, monster downtrend needs to break structure to give me more confidence 99% of coins look like this when you zoom out.

42413163,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7zyg,1673428189,"90% of WazirX's User Assets Are in Binance Wallets, According to Proof-of-Reserves Report","Indian crypto exchange WazirX released its proof-of-reserves report, and with that disclosed that 90% of its user assets are held in Binance wallets.  CoinGabbar, a third-party platform that tracks crypto assets, released WazirX's proof of reserves. At the time of writing, WazirX had $285 million of total user assets, displayed in the form of stablecoin USDT, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Of the total user assets, around 92%, or $259.07 million, was held in Binance wallets, with $26.45 million being held in other exchanges.  ""The total assets held by WazirX are greater than the assets held by WazirX on behalf of its users,"" a WazirX blog post said. ""With this, we are not only India’s largest crypto exchange by volume but also India’s largest crypto Exchange by reserves.""  ""90% of user assets are held in wallets at Binance, and the balance of 10% is stored in hot and warm wallets,"" WazirX added.  The revelation is significant because in August WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had a public Twitter spat about who controls WazirX.  ""While the user assets may be on Binance wallets, WazirX has the API (application programming interface) which gives us control of the tokens,"" said Rajagopal Menon, vice president of WazirX.  Shetty has previously said that his team has been in discussions with Binance for several months to work out the ownership issue.  ""The holdings at Binance Sub-Accounts belong to WazirX only but kept with Binance,"" said Sudeep Saxena, co-founder of CoinGabbar. ""The validity of these holdings depend upon Binance honoring the liquidation of the same. The same holds good for other exchanges including CoinDCX and SunCrypto, for which we have integrated the proof of reserve.""  Binance said it does not control its users' operations and assets and therefore is unable to verify the percentage of any of their users' assets on wallets on Binance, but users of Binance can be assured it has funds covering all users' assets 1:1.  ""Binance is trusted to provide wallet services as a tech solution to many users,"" said a Binance spokesperson. ""These users, including Zanmai (the Indian entity of WazirX's Singapore parent) who uses our wallet services for WazirX's operations, are in control of and responsible for the operations of their Binance accounts.""  At the time of writing, more than 19% of the WazirX user funds, the highest amount of a single token, was in the form of shiba inu (SHIB), with ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) holdings at 9.37% and 8.28%, respectively.  Several of India's most prominent crypto trading platforms have released proof-of-reserve reports now but in the days after the FTX collapse most had either declined to comment or didn't respond to requests for comments when asked if they would publicly publish their fund reserves or do a ""Merkle tree"" proof of reserves.

With the crypto market experiencing a surge in prices, ApeCoin has been riding the bullish wave upwards showing gains on almost all timeframes. ApeCoin is riding the bullish momentum, while Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) remain some of the dominant collections available on the NFT market. According to DappRadar, the two collections are first and second in terms of trade volume in the past month. However, with the recent Yuga Labs situation, will APE remain profitable to investors? Yuga Labs Lawsuit And How It May Affect ApeCoin Recent information about the lawsuit filed against Yuga Labs can affect APE’s ability to continue its bullishness. According to news, a federal judge ruled that Greg Solano and Wylie Aronow, the co-founders of Yuga Labs which created BAYC and MAYC, must face deposition in the most recent escalation between the company and Ryder Ripps who launched a counterclaim along with co-defendant Jeremy Cahen. Related Reading: Solana Moves On From FTX Calamity, Sparkles 46% In Last 7 Days The saga started back in June of 2022 when Yuga Labs filed a lawsuit against the artist, claiming that Ripps was scamming buyers of BAYC with supposed intentions of harming the company. Ryder has been a vocal critic of the Yuga Labs and BAYC, going as far as calling the community a brainwashed cult. “bayc is not a brainwashed cult” bayc: pic.twitter.com/zp0X9BL2SF — RYDER RIPPS 🔜 (@ryder_ripps) June 17, 2022 One of the counterclaims was the alleged Neo-Nazi origins, an accusation that was denied by Yuga in June last year. However, Ripps and Co. will now have a chance to question the two co-founders in detail under the threat of perjury which may or may not fall in favor of Yuga Labs, affecting the company and APE in its astronomical rise. Image: Twitter Will ApeCoin Continue APE’ing Around? As of writing, the token has been rejected on the $5 resistance range and has since started its downwards momentum. This might only be a short correction as APE rode the bullishness as the major cryptocurrencies rallied as well.

Investors and traders must keep tabs of the sworn statement against the company co-founders as the results of this will impact the firm and its NFTs and token. Short-term, the bears might win as the correction phase is in full swing. Investors and traders will find support at $4.2 which should sustain a further retesting of the resistance at $5.

The three-month bitcoin (BTC) futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), widely considered a proxy for institutional activity, are drawing a premium over the the cryptocurrency's going spot market price for the first time since FTX went bust.  The renewed premium indicates that institutional activity is no longer concentrated on the short side. The CME futures fell into a record discount in mid-November as sophisticated traders took bearish bets to hedge against a deeper FTX-induced slide in the leading cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin, however, has been more resilient than expected over the past two months, with the downside capped at around $16,000.  The three-month CME futures traded at an annualized premium of 0.2%, while their Binance counterparts drew a premium of 2.4%.  The CME futures term structure – the difference between futures of different maturities at a given time point – remains inverted or in backwardation, according to Arcane Research.  In other words, farther-month contracts continue to trade at prices lower than near-month contracts, an anomalous condition, considering prices are generally higher at the long end of the curve.

Markets analyst Glenn Williams Jr. wrote Tuesday that he's suddenly seeing an uptick in activity in a technical screen he uses to identify cryptocurrencies with rising volatility. It's especially surprising given how missing volatility was for the previous few weeks, as chronicled in a weekly report Tuesday by Glassnode.  The drama surrounding Digital Currency Group (owner of CoinDesk) continues, and the speculation can be seen in the recent narrowing of the so-called GBTC discount to an eight-week low.  Insights  Indonesia’s Government-Run Crypto Exchange Isn’t What You Think it Is  By CoinDesk Indonesia's Shenna Peter and CoinDesks's Sam Reynolds  Indonesia’s government is launching a crypto exchange. But it’s not completely correct to think that it’s launching a competitor to Binance.  Within Indonesia, crypto exchanges like Binance are referred to as “Physical Traders of Crypto Assets” by the country’s Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency, also known by its Indonesian acronym BAPPEBTI.  Behind the scenes there are a number of other entities that are specific to the country that are similar to the infrastructure found in traditional finance.  When authorities in Indonesia refer to ""crypto exchange,"" it means something closer to a pricing reference index such as the Nasdaq composite.  This is one pillar in the trading infrastructure ecosystem, alongside nationally regulated custodians (remember: post-Mt. Gox national custodian rules are why FTX Japan customers are whole) and a futures clearing house.  On one hand, this is how crypto trading goes mainstream in Indonesia and becomes an institutional-grade asset. Its only with regulations and infrastructure akin to traditional finance (TradFi) that institutions can truly invest in the asset class.  But on the other hand, crypto does lose some of its appeal if it's as regulated and controlled as equities. There are possibilities that the government might implement things like trading hours (which would be tough to do for crypto) and restrictions on price movements.  BAPPEBTI has yet to release a timeline as to when it expect sthis to be completed. The regulator says it is still working on building out this infrastructure, and is targeting a launch date sometime this year.  This entire system and infrastructure will be the first of its kind in the world. And Indonesia, given its scale, is a great place to put this to the test.

Also known as a multichain network, Polkadot supports many parachains, enabling developers to build their blockchains seamlessly. Several blockchain projects exist in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. These platforms usually emerge with different products and services related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Subsequently, users became intrigued with the full potential packed in the DeFi space. However, there was the challenge of how a user could access more than one blockchain and DeFi application through a single platform. This is where the value proposition of the Polkadot became prominent. Related Reading: Why The VIX Could Predict A 20% Bitcoin And Crypto Rally The last few months in 2022 were tough in the crypto market as most crypto assets and projects saw a drastic drop in performance. In addition, the unexpected collapse of the FTX crypto exchange brought a devastating condition that created losses in the crypto space. However, DOT has a positive story to tell. The multichain network reports massive growth in its ecosystem during Q4 2022. 1/ The Polkadot 2022 Roundup is here🚀 Despite the difficult year for the industry, the Polkadot and Kusama community were busy building the largest, & most diverse ecosystem of use case specific layer-1 blockchains in the world, making huge strides toward building a better web. pic.twitter.com/sGZDz0zHIW — Polkadot (@Polkadot) December 31, 2022 The recent achievement cuts across several landmarks and aspects. Notably, the protocol and its projects progressed technically with many collaborative deals and more technological adoption. Parachain Migration From Kusama To Polkadot On Oct 3, 2022, Polkadot recorded its first successful parachain migration from its canary network, Kusama. KILT Protocol completed a full migration from the Kusama Relay Chain to Polkadot Relay Chain. This milestone showcases Kusama as a suitable platform to stress-test digital applications in a real-life environment. Hence, the developers could curb associated risks before all the relevant upgrades to ensure stability and security. By using Kusama before its migration, KILT Protocol achieved decentralization. Also, the protocol included new functionalities in its upgrade, spiking its utility and efficiency. Through its collaboration with Polkadot, KILT integrated digital identities through decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $34.7M In SHIB From Binance Partnerships And Launch of Pools Distinguished Polkadot (DOT) in Q4 2022 Polkadot’s official Twitter page revealed its success for the last quarter of 2022. The multichain network consists of 74 parachains, over 550 projects, 300 decentralized applications, and more than 2,500 active developers in its ecosystem. The growth for the DOT and Kusama communities has been great since the launch of the parachains. Polkadot staking system received striking updates through the launch of nomination pools and the staking dashboard. This encouraged native staking holders to stake as low as 1 DOT to receive rewards. In line with its vision to enhance decentralization, it launched its OpenGov, a new-generation governance system on the Kusama network. The system is the most sophisticated and advanced blockchain governance system. It is proposed to kick off on the mainnet subsequently. Through Web3 opportunities, the DeFi protocol bagged several partnerships with different companies. These include Astra Network, KILT Protocol, Efinity, T-System MMS, and others. For over three years, it has been engaging the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the status of its native token, DOT. Finally, the Polkadot broke the barrier with its high achievement as DOT ceased to be classified as a security. It was announced on November 2022 that DOT is now considered as software. This is a feat that placed it higher in Web3 adoption. Also, 2022 marked extensive movement through the Polkadot Ambassador Program. Over 1,600 new ambassadors joined the program signifying more growth for the multichain network.
