7783476,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516816,1674171553,GMX Generates More Fees than BNB Smart Chain and Bitcoin,"GMX, the perpetual trading decentralized exchange (DEX) allowing up to 50X leverage, now generates more trading fees than the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and Bitcoin. GMX Is The Third Most Active Platform According to statistics, GMX’s 1-day fee on January 19 was around $589,000, while BSC and Bitcoin on-chain fees, over the same period, stood at $524,232 and $328,935, respectively. Ethereum and Uniswap are the only two major protocols more active than the perpetual trading decentralized exchange, per the above data. During this time, the total Gas fees accrued in Ethereum exceeded $5 million. In Uniswap, it was over $2.1 million, roughly 4x GMX’s and BSC’s daily fees. Related Reading: Binance USD (BUSD) Exchange Reserves Dry Up, Reason Behind Bitcoin’s Slowdown? GMX supports trading various coins, including BTC, ETH, and AVAX. As of writing, GMX had $96,802,651,673 in total trading volume with open interest, that is, the number of opened positions, long and short, of $207,102,720. Meanwhile, over 208,000 active traders were using the platform to trade on Arbitrum and Avalanche. GMX launched on Arbitrum and Avalanche, considering their scalability and low fees versus Ethereum. Arbitrum is Ethereum’s layer-2 platform permitting scalable and low-fee trading fees. On the other hand, Avalanche is scalable and boasts the fastest settlement time in crypto. By launching on these two platforms, GMX says it allows users to save on costs by entering and exiting positions with minimal spread and zero price impact. Traders take the profits of selling positions in USDC and the quote token when they go long. GMX prices are based on Chainlink’s decentralized oracles to prevent price manipulations. Trading Fees As A Measure Of Activity Trading fees generated by a dApp or on a blockchain are a crucial activity indicator. Despite the tendency of users to opt for protocols offering near-zero fees, the decentralized nature of blockchains means validators or entities securing core infrastructures must be compensated. In decentralized finance dApps like Uniswap and GMX, trading fees generated from swapping activities are distributed to liquidity providers (LPs). There are also governance tokens that are distributed. Anyone can be an LP. Related Reading: How Uniswap Was Saved From Critical Vulnerability By This Security Firm In September 2020, Uniswap distributed UNI to users who had, in one way or another, used the protocol to swap tokens before the airdrop distributing date. Currently, UNI trades at $6.1. Interestingly for GMX, the 1-day trading fee of $589,000 posted on January 19 exceeds the total average amount accrued over the past trading week of $565,682. The same trend can be observed in the top-5 most active platforms. Making extensions on this could point to renewed interest from users and traders using the protocol in one way or another. In GMX, it could mean more traders are posting traders, aiming to clip the market and turn in a profit. Coincidentally, the upswing in trading fees is recorded when the cryptocurrency market appears to be bottoming up after losses. At least, this was the trend in 2022.

42414608,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBC8VZ,1674170607,Paxos Courts MakerDAO With Paying Yield for Holding Up to $1.5B USDP Stablecoin,"Stablecoin issuer Paxos proposed paying a steady fee to decentralized finance giant MakerDAO for holding up to $1.5 billion of Pax USD (USDP) stablecoin among its reserves.  According to a proposal posted in Maker’s governance forum on Thursday, Paxos solicited MakerDAO to increase the maximum amount, also known as a debt ceiling, of USDP to $1.5 billion from the current $450 million in Peg Stability Module reserve system that backs the value of Maker’s DAI stablecoin.  In exchange, Paxos would pay a daily “marketing fee” anchored to 45% of the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR), which stood at an annual 4.3% at the time of publication. Paxos would only pay the fee if the debt ceiling is at $1.5 billion or higher on any given day. The maximum threshold would increase to $2 billion of USDP in 2024, per the proposal.  Paxos estimated that the facility would generate some $29 million of extra income annually for Maker if used at full capacity. The MakerDAO community will first discuss the proposal then put it to a vote.  USDP is a dollar-pegged stablecoin one-to-one backed by cash and cash-equivalent U.S. government debt instruments, according to independent attestations. Both Paxos and USDP are regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the state’s leading financial regulatory agency. Effectively, Paxos would pass a part of the revenue earned on the government bonds backing USDP to Maker.  The proposal is part of MakerDAO’s twin effort to reduce its heavy reliance on Circle’s USDC stablecoin while boosting the protocol’s income by investing in government bonds and different investment strategies to generate steady yield on a $7 billion pile of digital assets in its reserve. The so-called “Endgame Plan” was penned by Maker founder Rune Christensen and ratified in a vote in October.  In November, the MakerDAO community approved a hike in DAI’s reward rate to an annual 1%, redistributing a part of the new-found income from yields among token holders.  Paxos' proposal came after a dramatic voting where the MakerDAO community ultimately favored to keep Gemini USD (GUSD) stablecoin as part of a reserve asset for DAI.

And in a reversal from the rest of the week, the biggest event in Davos’ Thursday crypto calendar was without a doubt the main stage panel on crypto regulation featuring Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse; Mairead McGuinness, architect of the EU’s recent crypto law MiCA; Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, minister of state for artificial intelligence and the digital economy of the United Arab Emirates; and Klaas Knot, chair of the Financial Stability Board currently developing a global rulebook for the sector.  It was the only panel exclusively on crypto inside the main venue of the conference, and things got a little tense when Dutch central banker and chair of the Financial Stability Board Klaas Knot said many crypto assets were ""offered from places that I would call sunny places for shady people.""  Check out our more detailed coverage of what went down at that panel, and our exclusive interview with Mairead McGuinness on the prospects for international crypto laws.  More from Davos  The main venue of the conference also hosted a panel on the metaverse’s applications in industries – from port operations to bathroom refurbishment – just one day after some very different conceptions of the virtual online world were laid bare.  “Once my team put this [headset] on, they just didn't want to have to take it off,” said Åsa Tamsons, senior vice-president at telecoms company Ericsson, citing an unnamed executive who uses metaverse tech in construction.  Metaverse transformation of medicine means there may not even be hospitals in five years’ time, said Bernd Montag, CEO of Siemens Healthineers. If they’re not bullish on the tech, who will be?

BlackRock Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein, speaking at a Circle event, pointed out that his company – one of the world’s largest asset managers – expanded its role in the crypto industry last year.  “We have been carefully watching, learning, trying to understand everything that's been going on for five years, 10 years, whatever the amount of time has been, but we've been consciously choosing to have a strategy, [though] not yet to implement the strategy,” Goldstein said. “What's interesting about the year 2022, which was a remarkable year in so many ways, and through so many lenses … interestingly, it was the year that we chose at BlackRock to actually start implementing our digital assets strategy, the strategy that we had written over the past couple of years.”  BlackRock invested in Circle last year, and launched a fund for USDC reserves.  Another panel, hosted by the Filecoin Foundation, focused on the concept of “open science,” referring to the open-sourcing of vast amounts of data.

Plai Labs, led by several former executives of gaming studio Jam City and legacy social platform Myspace, aims to use the funding to grow its team and hire developers to build decentralized social platforms that couple Web3 and artificial intelligence.  Josh Brooks, executive vice president of marketing and operations at Plai Labs, is the former senior vice president of corporate marketing and recruiting at Jam City. He also previously served as vice president of programming and music at Myspace.  Brooks told CoinDesk that Plai Labs is working to lower the barriers to entry for new Web3 users through entertainment, social engagement and digital ownership.  “The metaverse is a lonely place unless there's a social connection,” said Brooks. “We're thinking about what we know and how to apply that to the next iteration of what we believe is going to be a new way that people interact with one another.”  The Plai Labs founding team is comprised of Brooks; CEO Chris DeWolfe, who previously co-founded and led Myspace and Jam City; and Chief Technology Officer Aber Whitcomb, who previously served as the chief technology officer at Jam City and Myspace.  “We love this intersection where AI connects with and inspires creators,” Plai Labs wrote in its press release. “If there’s one thing we learned while starting Myspace and building games that get downloaded in the billions at Jam City it’s this: The experience needs to be fun and approachable to reach a broad audience of users.”  Conversations around AI’s place in Web3 have begun to surface, as software such as DALL-E and ChatGPT have gone mainstream. Whitcomb told CoinDesk that AI will play a vital role in its game Champion’s Ascension, combining the technology that Plai Labs has worked to train with non-fungible tokens (NFT).  “Imagine being able to use your AI-based profile and putting it in any situation, like a piece of art.

According to the SEC, Nexo began to offer and sell the product, called the Earn Interest Product (EIP), in the U.S. in or around June 2020. The EIP allowed investors to tender their crypto assets to Nexo in return for Nexo's promise to pay interest. As per the SEC's order, Nexo allegedly exercised its discretion to use investors' crypto assets to make money for its own business and to fund interest payments to EIP investors. “We charged Nexo with failing to register its retail crypto lending product before offering it to the public, bypassing essential disclosure requirements designed to protect investors,” SEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement . Without admitting or denying the SEC's finding, Nexo agreed to pay a $22.5M penalty and cease its offer and sale of the EIP to U.S. investors. The lender will also pay an additional $22.5M to settle similar charges by state regulatory authorities.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  John J. Ray III, who previously handled Enron’s restructuring, said that despite the accusations of criminal misconduct against former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives, customers have lauded FTX's technology and said it could be worth reviving the exchange.  “Everything is on the table,” Ray told the Journal. “If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.”  The FTX token FTT rose 33% on Binance on the news.  The decision would come down to whether restarting FTX's international exchange would recover more for customers than just liquidating assets or selling the platform, Ray said.  In the interview, Ray also criticized Bankman-Fried's comments to the media and elsewhere as being unhelpful. Bankman-Fried has said FTX did not need to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and has been critical of Ray's decisions.  “We don’t need to be dialoguing with him,” Ray said. “He hasn’t told us anything that I don’t already know.”  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH): Thelargest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading around $21,100, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours. BTC regained ground it lost when it dipped the previous day. Ether was recently trading up 0.6% to $1,550. Both BTC and ETH have risen 13% and 7%, respectively, over the past seven days.  Equities closed down as traders’ recession fears continued to loom over markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.9%, while both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were down 0.7%. The recent risk revival in traditional markets and cryptocurrencies may not be sustained because the U.S. Federal Reserve is still fighting inflation, according to crypto options trading firm QCP Capital in a Thursday note.  Gemini USD (GUSD): Decentralized-finance giant MakerDAO’s community voted to keep the Gemini USD stablecoin as part of its reserve system for its DAI stablecoin. The outcome with the vote averted a near disaster for Gemini’s stablecoin because 85% of all GUSD in circulation has been held at MakerDAO’s Peg Stability Module. GUSD is a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by the troubled crypto exchange Gemini. Thursday’s voting means GUSD will remain as a reserve asset for Maker’s $5 billion DAI.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Readings Are in Rare Territory  By Glenn Williams Jr.  BTC’s recent 25% price surge came with a sharp uptick in momentum. A look at past data shows just how unusual the recent Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings are. RSI is a widely watched momentum indicator that looks to identify areas where an asset’s price is potentially overbought or oversold.  Within the last two weeks, BTC has registered three of the 10 highest RSI readings dating to 2019. Its reading of 89.3 on Jan. 14 ranked third, with its readings on Jan. 16 and 17 ranking eighth and ninth, respectively.  ETH’s RSI readings have been more muted, reaching the 12th and 15th highest slots since 2019.  The momentum is likely to wane, however. To an extent, we’ve already seen that with both BTC and ETH’s RSI falling to current levels of 78 and 73, respectively. However, a second look at past data shows that we’re still swimming in relatively uncharted waters.  Read the full technical take here.

7780734,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516805,1674165655,"Scaramucci: FTX Cannot Be Saved, Sam Betrayed Me","Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of Skybridge Capital, thinks failed crypto exchange FTX cannot be saved following its bankruptcy filing. Ex-FTX Boss’ Betrayal In an exclusive interview while attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the founder and American entrepreneur opined that there is no way the exchange could be saved. Still, Scaramucci considers the founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, a friend who was given a seat at the table of “high-profile people.” The problem is he feels betrayed that Sam turned out to be “delusional” and allegedly a fraud. Whether Sam will end up in jail or not, he adds, is up to the jury and the presiding judge. FTX, at its peak, was among one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, offering what was, at that time, thought to be a solid trading platform for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of users. Related Reading: 59% of Bitcoin Holders Are Sitting On Profits However, as the crypto market cratered and Bitcoin slid toward this week’s trade range of around $20k, cracks began to emerge in FTX. Eventually, an explosive piece revealing the misdoings of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, and several accounting errors in their finances broke the camel’s back. FTX halted customer withdrawals before news broke out that they were filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in the United States. It later emerged that FTX and its trading wing, Alameda Research, had misappropriated billions of customer funds. Anthony Scaramucci: Skybridge Capital Is Patient Considering the evidence presented and claims from the restructuring officer in charge of FTX bankruptcy proceedings, Anthony Scaramucci said nothing is to be done. He divulged that his fund wasn’t spared by the crypto winter and the FTX contagion as market prices slumped, affecting their revenue. Their core fund, Anthony said, was down 30 percent in 2022. In January 2023, there were signs of recovery, and their core funds are up double digits. Scaramucci also confirmed that Skybridge Capital is “completed unleveraged” and owns its inventory. Asked whether he lost money last year, he confirmed that his Bitcoin (BTC) is intact and didn’t lose any monies since he didn’t use leverage. Leverage is a trader borrows money to trade. The borrowed funds, together with the deposit, act as a margin allowing for higher profits. Still, there can be losses if a trader’s an incorrect prognosis. Traders can lose all their deposits if they use leverage and trade any other asset, including crypto. Anthony revealed that though FTX finds itself in crisis and could dissolve, the exchange was one of the early investors of Skybridge Capital, buying 30% of the fund. As part of the deal, the fund bought 10 percent of FTX’s FTT token only to sell it for a loss of $9.5 million. Related Reading: FTX’s FTT Token Spikes 43%, A Revival In The Works? Despite this, Antony said they are patient and waiting for “what the bankruptcy people say” so that they can buy back their shares. The fund, he explains, isn’t going to blame the disgraced founder of FTX for all woes in the crypto market or Skybridge Capital. Overall, he remains confident in crypto’s prospects.

42414607,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBC8Kx,1674165168,Bitcoin Holds Steady Near $21K Even as Equities Slide,"Bitcoin held steady near its most recent $21,000 perch, and a leading crypto analyst said the market had already priced in the looming bankruptcy filing of crypto brokerage Genesis Global Capital and other recent industry debacles stemming from the collapse of disgraced crypto exchange FTX .  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,980, up 0.8% over the past 24 hours, even as investors mulled conflicting economic reports.  “Most of the negative news should be priced in” because Genesis has been in trouble since the end of last year, Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign-exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Thursday note.  On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Genesis, a CoinDesk sister company, was in confidential negotiations with various creditor groups, with Genesis warning it could seek bankruptcy protection if it fails to raise capital. Bitcoin’s price tumbled as low as $20,370, a roughly 5% drop from the previous day, after the U.S. Department of Justice foreshadowed an announcement that it was charging Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Bitzlato with laundering $700 million.  But the announcement turned out to be “anticlimactic, at least in contrast to what the markets were guessing would happen,” said Michael Safai, managing partner of crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital. Safai told CoinDesk that the crypto market's recent positive sentiment could lift further if institutional traders maintain BTC’s trading range between $20,000 and $21,000 over the next couple of days.  Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands at around $1,550, up 1.1% from Wednesday, same time. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) recently climbed 1.8%.  Meanwhile, traditional markets continued to stumble this week, with the S&P down 0.7% for the day. The S&P, which has a hefty technology component, is off 2.1% for the past five days, as investors remain fretful about the prospect of recession and big banks kicked off the earnings season with mixed results.  Crypto-exposed stocks were also varied: Exchange Coinbase (COIN) was down 1.5% for the day, while bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) was up 6.2%.  Bitcoin’s strong 2023  The dip of the past two days has hardly dented bitcoin’s sterling performance so far this year. BTC has gained 26% since Jan. 1, rising from weeks-long doldrums around $17,000.  Martin Leinweber, digital assets product specialist at MarketVector Indexes, attributed bitcoin's recent rally to the weakening U.S. dollar, slower inflation and a short squeeze.  According to Coinglass data, traders liquidated some $492 million of short positions on Jan. 13, sending BTC above $20,000.  However, Leinweber said that it's still hard to call a market bottom because ""normally in a bear market violent rallies tend to fool investors into believing that this is a sustainable one,"" considering liquidity isn't fully returned yet.  “You very rarely see these V-shaped bottoms,” he told CoinDesk. “You see a rounding U-form, which just takes a little bit of time and there's a little bit of volatile in between. That's the best-case scenario. But I think you still need the right macro backdrop for risk assets in general to rise and the crypto can outperform.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/19/bitcoin-holds-steady-near-21k-even-as-equities-slide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad9fa854d468548743a6558741551af2ad203ed7-1132x586.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sun became a Global Advisory Board member in October, shortly after Hong Kong-based investment company About Capital Management became the majority stakeholder of Huobi, but it wasn’t previously confirmed that Sun was in charge of the exchange.

As investigations have shown, these accounts have made abnormal levels of profits many times, and the profits were quickly withdrawn. These are clearly the traits of rat trading.”  Huobi said it has “zero tolerance for rat trading.”  “Under the new management, Huobi will continue to conduct in-depth audits, hold responsible people accountable and publicize information in due time,” according to the statement. “A resolute and consistent crackdown on rat trading demonstrates Huobi's commitment to protecting the interest of its employees and users.”  CORRECTION (13:28 UTC): Clarifies that Justin Sun is the founder Tron, not founder and CEO as stated in an earlier version of this story.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/19/huobi-confirming-justin-sun-as-leader-takes-aim-at-rat-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab0207c55fdb5cf2fc1a6d650519a571e89b1a90-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The potential fundraise comes even after crypto exchange FTX's ( FTT-USD ) multibillion-dollar collapse late last year sent shockwaves through the space, resulting in a series of other bankruptcies and job losses that aren't showing any signs of ebbing. Nonetheless, crypto venture firm Paradigm has committed to leading the investment, the report noted. The value proposition of Flashbots is its ability to propose blocks for ethereum ( ETH-USD ) validators. Note Flashbots accounts for 60% of all ether blocks, according to its website , making it a dominant player within the ecosystem. At the same time, it aims to mitigate the problems related with Maximum Extractable Value (""MEV) on the ether blockchain. MEV represents the premium, or excess value, that block producers can charge users in a crypto network for reordering transaction blocks, though sometimes those producers take advantage of MEV extraction at the expense of users. As such, Flashbots' so-called MEV-Boost aims to reduce the ability for a miner to front-run users' transactions. The crypto market may be more muted post-FTX, but that's not stopping firms in traditional finance (TradFi) from entering the industry one way or another.

42410878,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsD7G,1674162234,"Gemini’s Bitcoin Inflows From Other Exchanges Dropped to Roughly Six-Year Low, CryptoQuant Data Shows","Executives at Gemini, the crypto exchange led by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, have insisted in a blog post that the halt in customer withdrawals on the company’s $900 million Earn program “does not impact any other Gemini products and services.”  But a close look at blockchain data reveals a recent slowdown in incoming bitcoin (BTC) transfers to Gemini from accounts at other exchanges, which analysts see as a possible sign some crypto traders have become more leery of sending their assets to the main platform.  Bitcoin holders might not be making the distinction that the yield-focused Earn program is separate from the exchange.  On-chain data sourced from CryptoQuant shows that the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) of BTC inflows to Gemini has ranged between roughly 100 BTC and 200 BTC in so far in 2023, down from roughly 1,100 BTC to 2,300 BTC about six months ago. The average dropped to 106.5 BTC on Jan. 8, the lowest in almost six years.  “Declining BTC inflows from other exchanges to any particular exchange could suggest investors/traders see that particular exchange as less desirable to have their coins on,” said CryptoQuant in a report on Jan. 3.  The overall industry has been hit hard in this bleak crypto winter, and yet other crypto exchanges have not seen such a dramatic fall in their BTC inflows as Gemini.  For example, Kraken’s and Coinbase’s current 30-day SMAs for their BTC inflows are not close to their six-year low. In 2023, Kraken’s incoming BTC transfers have oscillated between roughly 700 BTC and 1,030 BTC, while Coinbase’s have ranged from roughly 2,800 BTC to 3,700 BTC. Kraken and Coinbase BTC inflows have grown 42.5% and 30.5, respectively, this month, according to CryptoQuant.  Controversy over Gemini’s Earn program  Gemini executives have blamed the withdrawal halt at the Earn program on a separate withdrawal halt at the crypto trading and lending firm Genesis, a unit of the blockchain conglomerate Digital Currency Group (which also owns CoinDesk). Under the terms of Earn, customers would earn yield on their deposits. Gemini, in turn, transferred the deposits to Genesis, which promised to invest those deposits for interest.  But when Genesis fell on financial difficulties it halted withdrawals, forcing Gemini to impose the halt on its own clients.  Not only has the matter erupted into a feud on Twitter between Cameron Winklevoss and Barry Silbert, the DCG CEO, but the failed business arrangement also has now prompted a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Walter Teng, vice president of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said the inability for users to withdraw from Gemini’s Earn program has “negatively” affected people’s perception about Gemini.  “The $900 million hole exists because they trusted DCG to begin with, and I think the markets are sort of realizing that and reacting accordingly,” Teng said. “If customers previously lent to Gemini 10%, who then lent out to this lending desk conglomerate, who then lent out to degen trading firms, it’s just tough to be rest assured.”  In response to a request for comment from CoinDesk, Gemini’s head of communication, Natalie Rix, highlighted the website for the Gemini Trust Center, which states that “Gemini is a full-reserve exchange and custodian. This means that all customer funds held on Gemini are held 1:1 and available for withdrawal at any time.”  Gemini did not respond to a follow-up question that focused on the decline of BTC inflows from accounts on other exchanges.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Sage D.

It is also backed by a number of industry heavy-hitters, including venture-capital giant Paradigm, NFT-native investment fund 6529, digital art collector Cozomo Medici and others.  Notably, the marketplace has steadily been airdropping its BLUR tokens to users over the past few months, rewarding them for different levels of engagement on the platform. It first began airdropping “care packages” of BLUR tokens in October to anyone who traded an Ethereum-based NFT in the last six months. Care packages have been categorized into different tiers, including uncommon, rare, legendary and mythical.  “Our goal is to make Blur a marketplace that the entire NFT community owns and profits from,” the platform wrote in October. “Care Packages can be opened for $BLUR when we launch our token and protocol governance in January.”  In November, the platform launched another care package airdrop for all traders who listed NFTs on Blur through the month, this time rewarding active Blur traders with “the most tokens and control of the protocol.”  Airdrop 3, the final airdrop, launched in December and rewarded users who actively placed bids on collections listed on Blur. In its announcement, the marketplace said that the majority of BLUR tokens would be distributed to the community.  Thursday’s announcement garnered mixed responses from users who were eager for more information about the long-term plan for the tokens.  Some said the delay would allow the platform to continue offering incentivized trading opportunities and increase activity on the site.  Blur did not immediately respond to CoinDesk for comment on the delayed token launch.

42411057,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBEZm,1674161282,"At Davos, Dutch Central Bank Chief Takes Aim at Jurisdictions That Attract Bad Crypto Actors","DAVOS, Switzerland — Two European regulators, an Arab lawmaker and a lone crypto CEO sat down with a journalist in a snowy ski town on Thursday – and pretty quickly, the room was sweltering.  The four made up the only mainstage panel focused explicitly on crypto at this year’s World Economic Forum (which was notably less prominent than at last year’s programming, pre-FTX collapse). Although the speakers agreed on the need to supervise the space on a global scale, they didn’t hold back when addressing the recent market mayhem and company collapses that have sent both the industry and regulators on a desperate mission to rebrand and regroup.  The panel kicked off with Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, the United Arab Emirates' minister of state for artificial intelligence and the digital economy, saying his jurisdiction’s innovation-friendly regulatory approach was far from a “light touch” and ensured no crypto companies – including Ripple, whose CEO Brad Garlinghouse sat next to him – currently have licenses from the UAE's watchdog agency, the Virtual Asset Regulation Authority (VARA).  The minister faced tough questions from Stacy-Marie Ishmael, Bloomberg’s managing editor for crypto, on why Dubai tends to come up as the favored destination for disgraced crypto founders seeking refuge or resurrection.  Bad actors seek out jurisdictions such as Singapore, London or Dubai because ""people give"" these places a ""certain amount of credibility,"" Minister Al Olama said.  Addressing reports that collapsed crypto enterprise Terra’s founder Do Kwon had come to Dubai as authorities in South Korea launched a global search to locate him, Minister Al Olama claimed he hadn’t.  “I actually read an article that he was in Dubai, and I went out and looked for him. The guy wasn’t there,” the minister quipped.  Klaas Knot, president of the Dutch central bank and head of the Financial Stability Board, an international group, took aim at jurisdictions that attract crypto types for having lax oversight – a subject that has come to the forefront as the abrupt collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Bahamas-based FTX revealed poor management and misappropriation of company funds.  “Many of these crypto assets are offered from places that I would call sunny places for shady people,” Knot said.  Minister Al Olama later countered the regulator’s point, claiming that bad actors don’t have a “nationality” or “destination.”  “You will see them everywhere. You will see them in the Bahamas, you will see them in New York, London, and what we need to do as governments is to work together, with the industry as well, to ensure that if someone does something wrong he can't move from one place to the other,” he said.  While he expressed skepticism about crypto assets themselves, Knot played to the blockchain-not-crypto theme of the week at Davos, praising the blockchain technology that powers crypto transactions and ledgers – something with which the Netherlands has experimented.  “One of the things is that the benefits of this technology are beyond doubt. I mean, nobody is questioning the use of the technology,” Knot said.  Knot’s statement was a sharp turn from the Dutch central bank’s previous stance that blockchain is inefficient. On Thursday’s panel, however, Knot said regulators have been “so busy” on the “risk mitigation” aspect of crypto and therefore have paid less attention to harnessing the benefits of the technology.  As the lone crypto representative on the panel, Garlinghouse did his best to defend the industry’s integrity after the multitrillion-dollar market wipeout of last year. “As time goes by, I think we'll spend less time talking about Mt. Gox and Silk Road and more time talking about the real enterprise-scaled use cases where it's not an experiment,” Garlinghouse said.  Read more: Davos Day 3 Shows Conflicting Visions for the Metaverse, CBDCs  Global rules  Both Garlinghouse and Mairead McGuinness, the European commissioner for financial services, financial stability and capital markets union, emphasized the need for regulators to focus more on consumer protection measures as thousands of global retail investors took the hardest hit from the crypto collapses of 2022.  “Lots of people have suffered for what has happened now. So the consequences may not be immediate for financial stability, for individual stability, for both financial and mental health, this can be very dangerous,” said McGuinness, who spearheaded the European Union’s landmark Markets and Cryptop Assets (MiCA) regulation that’s now in its final stages of approval.  Previous discussions around crypto and blockchain regulations outside the main congress hall this week also homed in on a need for regulators to pay more attention to consumer protection measures instead of threats to financial stability in the aftermath of FTX and similar meltdowns.  The bedrock of crypto regulation needs to be global, McGuinness said, a point she reiterated in an interview with CoinDesk following the panel.  Speaking of Sam Bankman-Fried, Minister Al Olama said, “if someone else comes in and does the exact same thing in another jurisdiction, we will all have failed as governments. This is a lesson that we need to take today and make sure it doesn't get repeated tomorrow.”  But on regulating crypto, decentralized finance and even non-fungible tokens, even the European Union, with its comprehensive MiCA package, is lagging behind.  “Unfortunately, we can't wait for the next catastrophe. And we're already too late,” Minister Al Olama said.

A 15,000 weekly decrease in the number of Americans filing for unemployment insurance points to a stubbornly tight labor market Fed officials want to see loosen. But signs of economic slowdown appeared in housing data, with building permits for December down 1.6% versus expectations for a 3.7% increase. Housing starts fell 1.4% to their lowest level in five months.  Cryptos responded in kind, testing lows but then recovering as investors chewed over the conflicting data. Bitcoin declined temporarily to $20,780 before finding its footing. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading a little below $21,000. Ether's price also dropped, to $1,513, before rising to near $1,550.  Unusual RSI readings  BTC’s recent 25% price surge came with a sharp uptick in momentum. A look at past data shows just how unusual the recent Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings are. RSI is a widely watched momentum indicator that looks to identify areas where an asset’s price is potentially overbought or oversold.  Within the last two weeks, BTC has registered three of the 10 highest RSI readings dating to 2019. Its reading of 89.3 on Jan. 14 ranked third, with its readings on Jan. 16 and 17 ranking eighth and ninth, respectively.  ETH’s RSI readings have been more muted, reaching the 12th and 15th highest slots since 2019.  The momentum is likely to wane, however. To an extent, we’ve already seen that with both BTC and ETH’s RSI falling to current levels of 78 and 73, respectively. However, a second look at past data shows that we’re still swimming in relatively uncharted waters.  Since 2019, Bitcoin’s RSI has hovered between 78 and 79 just 10 times out of approximately 1,500 trading days. ETH’s reading has occurred 18 times over the same time period.  Historic behavior of the two assets differs, despite their relatively tight pricing relationships with each other.  The average seven- and 30-day returns for BTC after reaching its current RSI level have historically been 7% and 15%, respectively.  Ether’s seven- and 30-day historic returns at current RSI levels have been relatively mild, at just -2% and 1.6%, over the identical time frame.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/19/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoins-relative-strength-readings-are-in-rare-territory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e3fa3bfe561b1eb41ee6ed2246a19e8b326f64e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

China has been at the forefront of CBDC development among major countries, as it started to test the digital currency as early as 2020. The currency has been used in retail transactions and to buy securities, but smart-contract functionality on a mass retail scale has yet to be tested.  The smart contracts used by Meituan allow a daily prize of 8,888 RMB ($1,312) to be divided up, according to local crypto media outlet 8btc and other mainstream internet media outlets in China.  When a user places an order with the app and pays for it with the digital yuan, the smart contract is triggered and looks for certain keywords in the list of goods purchased and the merchant name. If a user happens to have some of those keywords, which change daily, the smart contract will allocate a portion of the 8,888 RMB to his or her digital yuan wallet.  At the end of 2022, digital yuan accounted for 0.13% of the total circulation of Chinese renminbi yuan, the People's Bank of China said earlier in January.

At the moment, Dogecoin is trading laterally. Over the last 24 hours, DOGE went up by 0.3%, which confirms that the coin was stuck in a consolidated price region. Last week, Dogecoin brought in close to 4% gains. The technical outlook for the Dogecoin price depicted that bearish momentum had set in. Demand and accumulation for the meme-coin depreciated when it started to trade sideways. Related Reading: Tezos Approaches The ‘Mumbai Upgrade’, What’s Next For XTZ? The meme coin noted a price pullback after it breached the $0.88 resistance level. Over the last few days, Dogecoin has witnessed a substantial influx of buyers; however, selling pressure has amplified at press time. Overall, the meme coin has a bullish structure as it has managed to keep its price above the 200-Simple Moving Average line. In the shorter time frame, Dogecoin might retrace close to the $0.74 level before recovering or falling in value further. The market capitalization of DOGE declined slightly, indicating that selling pressure has mounted on the chart. Dogecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOGE was trading at $0.81 at the time of writing. The coin corrected itself after it reached the $0.88 price level. Immediate resistance for the meme coin stood at $0.87, close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Moving past the $0.87 mark can push DOGE to the $0.104 resistance mark. On the other hand, if Dogecoin fails to stay above the $0.74 support level, it can fall to $0.66. If demand picks up slightly, it is unlikely that Dogecoin will fall below the $0.74 price floor. The amount of Dogecoin traded in the last session decreased, indicating that there has been a fall in buying pressure. Technical Analysis The meme coin has depicted a fall in demand as buyers started to decline on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) retraced after it stood close to the 70-mark, signifying excess buyers over sellers. This signified that the meme coin was correcting itself at press time. The RSI, however, remained above the 50-mark, indicating that buying strength was greater than selling strength. Dogecoin price was above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicating that buyers were in control of price momentum in the market. It was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) and 200-SMA (green) lines, indicating bullishness. The coin, however, formed a death cross where the 200-SMA line crossed over the 20-SMA line. A death cross is accompanied by a significant fall in value. The meme-coin continued to display buy signals on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which indicates price momentum and trend reversal, depicted green signal bars tied to buy signals. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Hold The Line At $20,700, But Bigger Losses Are Imminent? These green histograms were shrinking, indicating that it was probably not a good time to buy the asset.

42388217,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR99Od,1674156068,Circle CEO: US Stablecoin Legislation Is ‘Lowest-Hanging Fruit’,"Jeremy Allaire, CEO of peer-to-peer payment company Circle, is expecting the U.S. Congress to concentrate on stablecoin regulation this year for a simple reason.  “Stablecoins are the lowest-hanging fruit,” Allaire told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” Thursday from the World Economic Forum’s annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. “It’s the most straightforward. It’s a foundational piece.”  Circle is the issuer of USD coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. There are over $43 billion worth of USDC tokens in circulation, according to Crypto.com, and it is the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.  Allaire said USDC is a prime example of how stablecoin use is growing. Lawmakers, in the U.S. and abroad, are becoming aware of the “significant size and business” that stablecoins can provide. He predicted that this year stablecoin issuers are “going to be normalized in almost every major market.”  “What's happening is that members of Congress are realizing that they better get even more educated” about stablecoins, Allaire said.  ""This is a live policy issue. This is not a put your head in the sand and hope it goes away"" issue, he said.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset class, such as a fiat currency or gold, to stabilize its price.  What’s next, according to Allaire, is that lawmakers may take a firmer position on stablecoins in different places around the world, adding that the G-20 countries and the U.S. are leading those regulatory efforts.  The Boston, Massachusetts-based tech firm, founded in 2013, continues to evolve as crypto’s ecosystem develops and grows, Allaire said.  He said his company has been around for the last decade because it “walks through the front door with regulators,” and aims to be up front with them.  “That culture of trust and transparency, that plays itself out, [and it] pays dividends,” Allaire said.  Nonetheless, the changes Circle has undergone are “like climbing a mountain,” he said.  “You’re going to go up one part and you’re going to be like, ‘[damn] there's a cliff, I don’t want to fall off, I gotta pivot, and go back down, and then I gotta go back up,’” Allaire said.

42411247,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMVPJ,1674155423,"Bitzlato, Binance and What Regulators Are Really Doing","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) took a page out of a certain crypto-hype-man's book Wednesday when announcing an announcement. And following the age-old tradition, the news eventually disclosed was, at least on the surface, a bit of a nothingburger.  Given everything that has happened in crypto recently – the collapse of major crypto exchange FTX, the destabilization of crypto conglomerate (and CoinDesk parent) Digital Currency Group and even the disclosure of a massive, multi-year investigation into Binance, the world’s largest exchange by volume – the DOJ’s initial announcement piqued people’s attention. The cryptocurrencies bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) both fell by about 5% after the initial announcement.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But when the regulators and enforcers took the stage at noon Eastern time to announce they had shut down the little-known crypto exchange Bitzlato and arrested its founder in Miami, the whole charade looked like a waste of taxpayer money. What is a Bitzlato?  Tellingly, authorities misspelled the name of the exchange when uploading court documents. “Kinda feels like they heard about this exchange for the first time today too,” crypto researcher and critic Bennett Tomlin, who noted the anomaly, tweeted.  See also: Bitz Who Now? Department of Justice Takes Down Russian Exchange Bitzlato| Podcast  Bitzlato is a crypto exchange registered in Hong Kong and run by the Russian national Anatoly Legkodymov (who also goes by “Gandalf”). The indictment claimed the exchange processed about $4.5 billion worth of crypto currency transactions since its founding in 2018, of which $700 million is known to have flowed to or from the prominent “darknet marketplace” Hydra. Further, a “meaningful” volume allegedly came from U.S. customers – meaning it would be subject to “U.S. regulatory safeguards.”  The multi-agency investigation – including the DOJ, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Treasury Department in conjunction with about half a dozen European agencies – allegedly found that the “money transmitting business” Bitzlato was operating with minimal know-your-customer (KYC) oversights and was used to launder money from illicit sources including ransomware and drug trafficking.  Legkodymov allegedly was aware that his exchange was used by what he called “crooks” and even advertised it as such. If convicted of operating an illegal money transmitting business, Legkodymov faces a maximum sentence of five years.  Of course, few had heard of Bitzlato or its operator Gandalf before the press conference, reminiscent of how, in 2011, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), now the Senate Majority Leader, inadvertently turned a lot of people onto the legendary darknet market Silk Road (and bitcoin!) when calling for its closure.  That doesn't necessarily mean Bitzlato was not “the China-based money laundering engine that fueled a high-tech axis of cryptocrime,” as the FBI alleges. After all, darknet transactions are supposed to be secretive. But at its height, the exchange only held $6 million in funds – a remarkably miniscule amount. Likewise, similar Web searches show how little traffic the so-called crime hub had.  All of this raises the question of why the agencies would grandstand about what seems like relatively straightforward police work.  In the words of Deputy Attorney General Monaco, “Today’s actions send the clear message: Whether you break our laws from China or Europe – or abuse our financial system from a tropical island – you can expect to answer for your crimes inside a United States courtroom.”  Taken at face value, the suggestion is that the police are going to police and that, while the crypto industry may be global and “decentralized,” much of that investigatory work is going to start and end in the U.S. This isn’t anything new. The superpower isn’t called the “world’s policeman” for nothing. Likewise, the “long arm of the law” has wrangled in a number of offshore companies over the years.  Still it’s a strong statement – and that might send shivers down Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao’s spine. Bitzlato’s top counterparty was Binance, (followed by Hydra and an alleged Ponzi scheme called “Finiko”).  Industry news site Protos suggested that the Bitzlato investigation was likely kick-started, or accelerated, by the seizure of documents from the Hydra marketplace last year. If that were true, it means the DOJ, which is reportedly already investigating Binance, would have similar data on flows between Binance and Hydra. According to research done by NBER’s Igor Makarov and Antoinette Schoar in 2021, Bitzlato was the second-largest source of Hydra’s volumes after Binance (and above the peer-to-peer network LocalBitcoins).  This isn’t to paint a target on Binance – critically, the exchange has boosted its KYC procedures and relationships with regulators over the years. But it’s clear from CoinDesk reporting that the Securities and Exchange Commission is interested taking a look under the hood at the industry’s biggest exchanges, and Binance is still reportedly staring down a money laundering complaint. If and when that comes no one should be surprised if Hydra is named.  If anything, yesterday’s indictment only proved that regulators and police have the tools necessary at their disposal to investigate and indict alleged crypto criminals. That’s worth mentioning in the wake of FTX, and other high-profile blockchain embarrassments last year, now that lawmakers are calling for stricter rules and oversight of the industry.  See also: Binance Named as Counterparty in FinCEN Order Against Bitzlato  According to the Washington Post, the Bitzlato enforcement was the first action led by the Justice Department's crypto-focused ""NCET"" team started in 2021. It was also an opportunity for the U.S. Treasury Dept.'s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to debut more powers granted by a 2021 defense authorization law to combat Russian-related financial crimes, including bypassing slower procedures to administer punishments by fiat.  There’s an argument to be made that oversight of monetary transfers is already overly broad – it penalizes everyone by starting from the premise that surveillance for the sake of safety is normal. But ever since the seizure of the Silk Road, it has been evident that fully public, transparent and immutable blockchains are horrible systems to do illicit business on – and yet people choose to do so. The crimes are there, the laws are on the books.  That’s part of what made yesterday’s presser so cringey. In particular, Monaco’s allusion to the “tropical” Bahamas-based FTX exchange – when discussing the broad authority for U.S. agencies to pursue crimes – only goes to show how often regulators fail to preempt anything. Bitzlato may have been an exception, but it pales by comparison.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/19/bitzlato-binance-and-what-regulators-are-really-doing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe8cc9b49906344a938627ba5866dd22a9c6da0e-3936x2624.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The news followed media reports that sports merchandiser Fanatics was selling its 60% stake in Candy Digital but, again, the amount wasn’t included. A new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday finally provided some financial figures.  According to the filing, Candy Digital had raised $38,449,997 from 14 investors in an equity offering, more than half of the $68,188,480 overall that the company is seeking to raise in the sale. The offering opened on Jan. 3 – the day before CNBC reported that Fanatics was selling its stake to a group led by well-known financier Michael Novogratz's Galaxy Digital.  Candy Digital was established in 2021 by Galaxy Digital, Gary Vaynerchuk and Fanatics during a sports NFT boom and debuted with a Major League Baseball (MLB) partnership. The startup raised a $100 million Series A round in October of that year at a $1.5 billion valuation.

7773828,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516718,1674151218,"Binance USD (BUSD) Exchange Reserves Dry Up, Reason Behind Bitcoin’s Slowdown?","On-chain data shows the Binance USD (BUSD) exchange reserves have declined recently, a factor that may be behind Bitcoin’s slowdown. Binance USD (BUSD) Exchange Reserves Have Gone Down As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there was a very large inflow of $250 million BUSD just a while ago. The “exchange reserve” is an indicator that measures the total amount of a cryptocurrency (which, in the present case, is Binance USD) currently being stored on wallets of centralized exchanges. Generally, investors swap their coins for stablecoins like BUSD when they want to avoid the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When these holders feel that prices are right to reenter the volatile markets, they shift their stables back into their desired coins. This can act as buying pressure for the specific crypto that they are swapping into. Investors usually make use of exchanges to swap these coins, which means that whenever the exchange reserve of a stablecoin like BUSD rises, it presents the possibility that holders want to buy back into volatile cryptocurrencies. A large enough increase in the stablecoin reserve can result in a high amount of buying pressure for other coins, and can therefore have a bullish effect on their prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops To $20,700 As Miner Outflows Surge Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Binance USD exchange reserve (specifically for spot exchanges) over the past couple of months: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Binance USD exchange reserve observed a rapid increase a while back. Since then, however, the metric has been steadily declining and has hit significantly lower values now. But from the chart, it’s apparent that while the BUSD reserve was coming down from high values, Bitcoin had been rallying instead. This means that holders might have been actively swapping the stablecoin for BTC, thus providing a boost to its price. The graph also displays data for a metric called the “exchange netflow,” which tells us the net number of coins entering or exiting exchange wallets. When this metric has a positive value, it means investors are depositing a net amount of the asset to exchanges currently, while negative values suggest net withdrawals are taking place. A while ago, there was a huge positive spike in the Binance USD exchange netflow of around $250 million (which is what caused the reserve to blow up). This inflow may have been what helped the recent BTC rally. Related Reading: Asian Traders Behind Most Of Bitcoin’s Recent Gains, Report Reveals However, since then, there have only been outflows, which have taken the reserve back to the same level as before this $250 million spike. This suggests that buying pressure from this inflow has now dried up, which could be one of the factors responsible for the latest slowdown in Bitcoin’s rally. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $20,700, up 14% in the last week.

42388219,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR99hL,1674150066,"‘No Point’ to European Union's Crypto Rules Unless World Follows Suit, Official Says","DAVOS, Switzerland — New European Union crypto rules are pointless unless the rest of the world follows suit, the bloc’s leading financial-services official told CoinDesk at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.  European Commissioner Mairead McGuinness said the turmoil in the crypto market has given extra ammunition to those pushing for a global rulebook, but warned future crypto innovations need to be focused on people.  “It's great that we can say that” the EU is the first major jurisdiction in the world to regulate the sector with its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA), McGuinness told CoinDesk on the sidelines of the meeting in Davos. “But there's no point in Europe being on its own, because this is a global development, and we can't put barriers on it.  “If we fail to do that global approach, we're going to find that there's more and more problems,” McGuinness said. “The technology is borderless.”  Read more: European Union Postpones MiCA Vote to April  The seeds of a likely global crypto regulatory framework have already been set by the Financial Stability Board, an international group that makes recommendations about the global financial system. Klaas Knot, the board's chairman, told an audience in Davos that he wants to complete controversial proposals before the summer. But McGuinness was honest about the practical challenges of implementing international rules.  “I do hope there is” global crypto regulation, she said. “But you know, when it comes to climate change, we all want global things to happen, and they're not, so sometimes somebody has to start the process.”  MiCA, which is set to be formally approved by the European Parliament in April, sets reserve requirements for stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that are typically pegged to the U.S. dollar – and governance rules for crypto companies. The fear is that MiCA will be undermined if exchanges or digital-wallet providers try to serve EU customers from regulatory havens, which McGuinness referred to as “sunny places for shady people"" – something fellow European regulator and head of the Financial Stability Board, Klaas Knot, had said earlier during a panel on finding the right balance for crypto.  'Let’s talk'  The travails of 2022 when many major crypto firms collapsed, including Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX, stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs and lenders Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, may help McGuinness in her quest.  “We're now, I think, in a good place because we have seen very visible examples of how things can go wrong,” she said. “I think the world now knows that, if it happened there, it can happen anywhere, so let's talk.”  FTX’s founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, is now facing multiple criminal charges in the U.S., including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, to which he has pleaded not guilty. But McGuinness argues regulation is needed even for less egregious cases.  Some people got involved in crypto because of their distrust of the establishment and excitement about technology, and “it just went to their head and got out of control, and then there are casualties from that,” she said.  “There’s still, I think, an unfinished debate about what the problem is, or is there a problem with crypto inherently?” she said. “People with the best intentions can make business mistakes, and crypto people can make big business mistakes that then impact on individuals, or further down the financial system.”  Running ahead  Even once MiCA takes effect around the start of 2025, it won’t be the end of the story. Crypto evolves quickly and “we will have to tweak what’s in place,” McGuinness said, but she also cautioned against rushing to regulate areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) that aren’t well understood yet.  “We need to get our heads around all of this,” she said. “DeFi – you ask the man or woman in the street what this is, and really they do not know, so we need to be very careful that we're not running ahead of ourselves.”  One option is to “have places or sandboxes where we can test things out before making it freely available, and decide based on the test whether it's going to work or whether it's not,” she said, citing an approach the EU has taken in experimenting with distributed ledger technology-based securities trading.  Meanwhile, crypto providers also need to remember what they are trying to achieve, and whom they are serving, she said.  “Sometimes you forget when you're talking about technology, this is ultimately about European citizens … they want service,” she said. “We may see pushback against this over excitement around the evolutions of finance.”  As examples of pushback, she cited lawmakers’ frustration over the closure of bank branches and ATMs, and her own personal – but relatable – frustration at waiting on hold for 45 minutes with a financial-services provider.  “If I were in the financial system, I would be thinking, how do we avoid that disconnect from our customers?” she said. “This excitement around technology is super wonderful … but don't underestimate that it has to be human-centered.”  Read more: EU’s MiCA Law May Have an FTX-Shaped Loophole  Update (Jan. 19, 2023, 19:07 UTC): Clarifies Commissioner McGuinness is referring to a statement made by Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot on ""sunny places for shady people"" in paragraph seven.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/19/no-point-to-eus-crypto-rules-unless-world-follows-suit-senior-eu-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ad2439db5b1b144fc0b5dbd39aa465cedb2c150-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ray, a restructuring expert who oversaw Enron's bankruptcy proceedings, noted he has created a task force to explore rebooting operations at FTX.com, the crypto empire's international exchange, he told The Wall Street Journal in an interview. His thinking behind the potential move comes as customers have lauded FTX's technology and suggested the revival of FTX.com would recover more value than liquidating the firm's assets, he said. That's despite the fact that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was accused of defrauding customers prior to his resignation and the simultaneous bankruptcy filing on Nov. 11, 2022. “Everything is on the table,” Ray said , as quoted by the newspaper. “If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.” In response to Ray's first interview since taking over FTX in November 2022, Bankman-Fried told The WSJ “this is a shocking and damning comment from someone pretending to care about customers.” SBF, as he is known, denied federal allegations last week, saying ""I didn't steal funds, and I certainly didn't stash billions away.""",NEUTRAL,FTT,EXCHANGE | ICO | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3925996-ftt-token-pops-after-new-ftx-ceo-says-crypto-exchange-could-get-a-redo?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7772992.jpeg

The digital asset has been able to successfully make its way out of a depressing bear trend and reached two-month highs in the process. However, with the recent pullback, there may be a bit more pain for bitcoin investors before the upward rally continues. Analyst Justin Bennett Says Bitcoin Below $20,000 Is Possible In a new issue of his crypto trading newsletter, analyst Justin Bennett reveals some bearish tendencies of the market. He first points to the fact that the market has enjoyed a good amount of gains, adding as much as 28% to its value in just the last 18 days. But as is expected after such a rally, a market correction has pulled back the price of the digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Investors Predict 12% Decline For BTC In Next Two Weeks While there have been speculations that this pullback would only be temporary, Bennett explains that it could go a lot further. Now, the analyst does not take away from the bull trend that bitcoin is currently on but rather presents a scenario where the price of the cryptocurrency could back to below $20,000 before the rally resumes. BTC could see sub-$20,000 before rally resumes | Source: Cryptocademy BTC has already fallen back into the $20,000 region as of the time of this writing, giving credence to Bennett’s analysis. However, with key support for the digital asset now resting at $20,000, bears could pull the price as close to this support as possible before the bears take over once more. “I like Bitcoin higher toward $25,000 and potentially $29,000, but not without a pullback into the $20,000 region first,” Bennett said in his newsletter. Factors That Drive This Pullback In the same newsletter, Bennett points to the PPI data release that underwhelmed the market. In the end, the much-anticipated release was lower than expected, triggering fatigue in the market. Bitcoin had fallen below $21,000 as a result of this. Also pointing to the US Dollar Index (DXY), the analyst explained the movement of this index on the back of the PPI data release would’ve been bullish for assets such as BTC. “But I think markets got ahead of themselves, so a lot of that bullishness was already priced in,” Bennett added. BTC corrects downward following rally | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Since this pullback has pushed the price of BTC dangerously close to the 5-day moving average, it should come as no surprise if the cryptocurrency were to lose another couple of hundred dollars off its value in the coming days.

42388221,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR99m1,1674147003,MakerDAO Votes to Keep Gemini USD in DAI Stablecoin’s Reserves,"Decentralized-finance (DeFi) giant MakerDAO’s community voted to keep the Gemini USD (GUSD) stablecoin as part of its reserve system for its DAI stablecoin in a dramatic vote that flipped at the finish line.  In a poll that concluded Thursday, 50.85% of the votes favored keeping the GUSD debt ceiling at $500 million level in Maker’s Peg Stability Module (PSM), while 49.15% voted for decreasing to zero. The result means GUSD will remain as a reserve asset for Maker’s $5 billion DAI.  Up until the end of the voting, votes favoring removing GUSD from the PSM led the tally.  Venture capital firm ParaFi Capital seems to have delegated just enough voting power in the last minutes to flip the end result, according to blockchain data and information on MakerDAO’s governance forum.  GFX Labs, the largest delegate in favor of keeping GUSD with 13.9% of all votes, received 10,000 MKR tokens representing 7.5% of all votes in two transactions from a wallet address as the voting was nearing its end. Blockchain analytics firm Nansen identified ParaFi as the owner behind the wallet. Notably, ParaFi is an investor in Gemini.  MakerDAO is led by a decentralized autonomous organization, where holders of the maker (MKR) governance token make decisions by voting on proposals. Token holders can give their voting power to delegates, and votes are weighted by the number of tokens.  “Recent MakerDAO governance discussions have raised concerns about GUSD’s heavy reliance on the PSM and Gemini holding GUSD reserves at Silvergate,” Riyad Carey, an analyst of digital-asset research firm Kaiko, wrote in a report earlier this month, referring to Silvergate Bank, a crypto bank that saw a large outflow of customers' digital-asset deposits in the fourth quarter.  The outcome with the vote averted a near disaster for Gemini’s stablecoin, because 85% of all GUSD in circulation has been held at MakerDAO’s PSM, according to MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin treasury website.  GUSD is a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Gemini, the troubled crypto exchange of mega crypto entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. It is ostensibly backed one-to-one by cash and U.S. Treasurys, and it’s regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.  The Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange has already come under pressure after it halted withdrawals from its yield-generating Earn program, which is being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly selling unregistered securities.  MakerDAO’s treasury earns a 1.25% annual yield for holding GUSD as a reserve asset, which is a substantial revenue stream for the organization.  Update (Jan. 19, 19:35 UTC): Adds detail about ParaFi’s role in voting.

Thanks for having me. Daniel Snyder: So we like to kick things off. If you don't mind for those of people that don't know you, do you have like a one-minute overview of who you are, how you got into crypto investing, and then maybe what's going on in Seeking Alpha Marketplace service? Mike Fay : Yeah, yeah, I can see if I can do it in 60 seconds or less. I'm an analyst previously in media and took that kind of skill set that I felt I had an aptitude for and applied it to my own personal investing and felt that I could do it pretty well. So I started writing for Seeking Alpha in 2019, covering mainly media stocks and some of the gold stocks. I'm not a macro analyst. I wouldn't consider myself that, but I do try to pay attention of things like cost of credit and how that impacts the markets overall. Came into crypto in the 2017 cycle. I did not buy it in 2017. I waited until things kind of fell apart in 2018 to start scaling in. Really enjoyed the 2020, 2021 run up, and have felt that the space is very interesting similar to how maybe the tech bubble was in ’99, 2000. You're going to have a lot of things that are going to go crazy and be it based on purely hype, but when the wreckage happens, which is what we're dealing with now, out of that, you'll be able to find some things that are very useful. So I've covered some of those ideas. I've covered things that I don't like to try to help people steer away from those types of coins and ideas. But mainly, my focus at the moment is to provide BlockChain Reaction, which is a marketplace service with Seeking Alpha, where I try to provide my insights on the crypto assets and the crypto ideas that I do like and help people kind of have this second tech boom, I guess, after whatever crypto winter, how long it takes, we're in the depths of it at the moment. But that's mainly my background there. Daniel Snyder: So you're saying this is, like, the dot-com bubble time of crypto or the great financial crisis time of banks, is that kind of what you're saying here? Mike Fay : I think that we're in the - we're in a cycle a cyclical moment with crypto assets specifically that I think will be very - 20 years down the line, I think, it will be applicable to what people experience with dot-com bubble and finding Amazon ( AMZN ) at the floor, finding Apple ( AAPL ) at the floor names like that. Daniel Snyder: Interesting. So there's a lot for us to cover today. I mean, as we all know, 2022 is quite the year for crypto. But here we are at the beginning of 2023 January. Today is Wednesday, January 18th while we're recording this. And we've seen a recent kind of rise in the price of Bitcoin overall. And I know a lot of people turn to Bitcoin as the most well-known Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). What do you attest to this? Do you think this is something that might continue? Mike Fay : I've actually been telling the BlockChain Reaction subscribers that I think that this is probably a rip to sell. I don't know that there is a fundamental purpose for this yet? I think that a lot of it is a bear market rally. Having said that, Bitcoin going underneath 15,000, going underneath 14,000 has become a bit of a consensus view. So it could be possible that the bottom is in. It's possible that it's not. I personally take the view that we're going to have one more leg lower, but I could certainly be wrong. I think what we've seen now is we've seen most of these assets have essentially retraced where they were following the FTX collapse. So right before FTX, Bitcoin and Ethereum looked very bullish. They had just broken out over their, I believe, 20-week moving averages, which is a metric that I've been focused on literally for two years. And they had - they were really favorable setups, FTX collapsed, everything fell apart. Those big, big declines have essentially been retraced on this rally, and now we're at those kind of resistance levels. Everything is getting very, very hot from an RSI perspective. And that's just the TA view. From a fundamental perspective, which is what I like to look at, we're seeing some things that are doing very well. Other things, maybe not so much, and they're just kind of getting caught up in the rally. Daniel Snyder: Yeah. It's still weird kind of state of the overall crypto environment, though. I mean, me and you were just talking yesterday prepping for this about what's going on with the SEC bringing charges against the crypto firms, Genesis, and Gemini. Could you maybe touch on that a little bit and what's happening right here in time and, like, what might be keeping investors out of the sector of the market? Mike Fay : Yeah. So Genesis is Gemini, Genesis, two different companies. They sound similar. It can be a bit confusing. Genesis is essentially a lending arm for Digital Currency Group, DCG. DCG owns many crypto businesses. Genesis is one of them. Gemini is a more consumer-focused crypto exchange. They also have an earning platform as well, where Gemini users can take their bitcoin or their ether whatever cryptos they have, lend them through Gemini's yield earning vehicle, and then Gemini takes those assets and does what they do with them. They loan them out, so that they can generate a yield for the consumer. Some of the Genesis - or excuse me, the Gemini assets that were customer assets were lent to Genesis, which then lent them on again. Genesis had a lot of exposure to not just FTX, but Three Arrows Capital, which is another firm that kind of blew up last year. So Genesis has had some serious liquidity problems. They've essentially been unable to pay back Gemini who has this obligation to their customers that they can now no longer pay. And you have essentially just another example of the centralized custodial-based approaches to crypto not working out because they're trying to do traditional finance things without kind of the traditional finance safeguards. And agencies like the SEC are supposed to be able to step in and put a stop to these things. They have done that effectively with some of them. People may forget that the SEC if threatened to sue Coinbase ( COIN ), I believe it was early 2021 when Coinbase wanted do a yield earning product similar to Celsius, similar to BlockFi, these companies that haven't made it. And the SEC before Coinbase has even been able to do that said, hold on. Don't do this. This is a security. And so because you're offering yield on assets, you're offering securities, and you haven't registered them as securities with us. So there's a history with the SEC coming after companies before they do it. There's a history with the SEC coming after companies after they do it. What we haven't seen with Gemini and Genesis, in this instance, is the SEC coming after them after they've already blown up. That's if - you're looking for consumer protection, that ain't it. But that's in a nutshell. What has been going on with Genesis, Gemini, because of this issue with Genesis, which again is owned by Digital Currency Group, you now have the contagion fears that other digital currency groups subsidiaries like Grayscale will somehow be impacted by this, and that's I think contributed to the NAV discount that we've seen in a lot of the Grayscale assets. Daniel Snyder: And that's kind of the dark cloud looming over the industry, right? And I think what was interesting to me while I was doing a little bit of research on this was Gemini is actually led by the Winklevoss twins, right? Aren't they the ones that sort of started in? You get 340,000 users that are now out $900 million of frozen assets. Mike Fay : Yep. Daniel Snyder: I mean, is this why you're diving into fundamentals and trying to figure out these tokens and where to go next? Because there's just like destruction. Mike Fay : I think that if there's any lesson that we have learned from this debacle aside from leverage, crypto assets already move ridiculously fast. You don't need leverage to take advantage of that. You're going to get a 20% move in some of these things overnight on occasion. So I think that the lesson is, aside from leverage, like I said, is these things are not supposed to live with custodians, right? They live on chain, public blockchain is supposed to take away the need for custodial permissioned systems. That's exactly why Bitcoin exists is because of this is Bitcoin came into existence as a result of the financial crisis. Banks blowing up, getting bailed out, being essentially in control of the currency. Crypto is supposed to be anti-custodial. And so when you buy Ethereum, if you're holding it on Coinbase, you're doing it wrong. Same with Bitcoin. You can get yield in DeFi protocol. DeFi held up very well. When Celsius blew up, when BlockFi blew up, Three Arrows Capital, not a yield generating thing, but Gemini can't pay back the customers. DeFi itself has done well. The problem with DeFi is that it's difficult for normal people to do it, but so is trading stocks, right? It's hard to find stocks that are actually fundamentally valuable, especially in an era of low interest rates. So the point is we have to learn from the mistake that we've learned throughout the existence of crypto, which is hold it yourself. To the extent that you can, hold it yourself, not your keys, not your coins. Daniel Snyder: Yeah. And so before we move on to your top token idea of 2023, since we're already talking about the blow ups that we've seen happened in FTX and everything, why don't you go ahead? What's the Mike hot take on the entire FTX action going on right now? Mike Fay : It's really confusing. The whole FTX thing is so wild because it involves politics. It involves Congress. Legislation is coming out of this. It seems you have the digital asset bill, which is by bipartisan, but has been championed by people like Elizabeth Warren, and I'm not going to get into politics. But if you look at that bill and you look at what's in it, you think, okay, this isn't really going to solve what was the reason for FTX, but FTX as an exchange, is interesting because it's not just one business, it's actually two. You had the international business. You had the U.S. business. Sam Bankman-Fried, who started FTX, claims that the U.S. business is fine and that it's solvent and that those customers could get their assets back overnight, okay? That's interesting. But the bigger issue is that, let's say, FTX U.S.’s whole. For some reason, we still had FTX international offshore doing things with customer assets, learning them to a related party that is obviously in a lot of trouble. And so the whole thing is just kind of a disaster. At the same time, you've got the CEO of the Exchange donating all of this money to political interests on both sides of the aisle, there's going to be callbacks because of that. So a lot of that money that has been donated to some of the politicians who have received it has been donated to charities because they - because the whole FTX thing is blown up, they're like, okay, this is dirty money, I guess, that I can't keep in my pocket. So I got to - give it to somebody who can do something nice with it. Great. But there's clawbacks. And that money belongs to somebody else. So I think that this FTX situation, I don't know how long it's going to take, but it's going to take a long time to sort all this out. I think that we will - we will see higher Bitcoin prices before, in my opinion. We'll see higher Bitcoin prices, higher Ethereum prices, long before the FTX saga is over. Daniel Snyder: So wouldn't investors then be worried if there is an increase in price and then legislation action comes in? I mean, when do you see the market react to that through this process like you're talking about? Mike Fay : It depends on what kind of regulatory result there is. And then this is actually the biggest risk in my mind for any of these things. Bitcoin is a proof of work consensus mechanism. So I don't know how you could justify claiming that it's a security Ethereum previously by the Clayton admin – Clayton, when he was in charge of the SEC. Ethereum was not a security, but now under Gensler, it might be. So these types of things I think definitely could be a problem. But when I say the regulations, I don't know - I guess what I mean is, like, the bankruptcy proceedings with FTX and the actual the flow of funds from, however, that plays out. We could get regulations for crypto long before that happens, and I think that we probably will. But regulations are concerned, could bitcoin be a criminal by decree, of course. That happened in Nigeria. Didn't work out well because half of the country still used it anyway. But anything is possible in this space. And it's always I say, if you're going to have an investment portfolio, a real investment portfolio, you want exposure to equities that actually have value, that have fundamental value, that are important products, preferably companies that pay a dividend. You probably want to have some exposure to historical inflation hedges: gold, silver, good? And then with what is remaining, your speculative stuff, tech stocks, crypto, it's fine for that. But there's a lot of risks still, of course. Daniel Snyder: So you went up, I just want to follow-up off of that because you say anything can happen in this space. You say that there's risk. So how do you approach risk management with positions you take or just what you're recommending to people within the crypto space? Mike Fay : Right. Great question. So my portfolio at the moment, I think, there's about 20 assets in it. The main five make up close to 92%, I think, of the of the portfolio. So everything else is very small, position-wise. I think the last top token idea that I shared at the end of December was like, a fourth of a percent or something like that. So these aren't large positions in a crypto portfolio that has 20 assets. I like Bitcoin. I like Ethereum. I think those are the blue chips of the space. And then from there, then when you go further out on the risk curve, you want to make smaller bets. And even with those smaller bets, you want to find things that actually solve some sort of a problem that have some sort of a network effect. The thing that I try to look at when I analyze these top token ideas is why does this have to be on the blockchain, right? Who benefits from this being on the blockchain, right? And so I think that there are, for example, I'll give one example. Rocket Pool, RPL token is a liquid staking protocol on Ethereum. It solves an actual problem. However, it's completely tied to Ethereum. So if Ethereum fails, RPL is done too, right? So knowing that the deeper you go into one specific ecosystem, the farther you - farther out you're going on the risk curve. And so from - if you're looking for alpha on some of those riskier things, then my service is probably going to be a great fit. If you really just want exposure to the blue chips, you don't really need me. You can probably just focus on Bitcoin, Health, and maybe a couple of others. Daniel Snyder: So let me ask you. We're talking about proof of stake, proof of work. If you kind of had to, like, just share off the top of your mind when you're researching all these different tokens, and you see proof of work or proof of stake, which one do you lean towards as being more safe at this moment in time? Mike Fay : I think from a regulatory perspective, proof of work is probably safer. I think it's easier to justify that the - it passes in a good way to how we test because it's not a sole issuer. With staking, you get a little bit more into the gray area there, especially because it's producing a yield generally. And so you have, I think, depending on if you have a large emission for token issuance, so a lot of these things like our proof of stake have very, very low circulating supplies, 15%, 25%, pretty common. That's really, really low. It's very inflationary. So the reason they have to be staked is because you want to - if you actually want a real yield, you have to have a really high staking reward that provides a real yield in addition to the rate of inflation of the token, right? So there's a legitimate expectation of a profit if your real yield calculation is actually positive. And since it's coming from generally a handful of entities, you could argue that it's closer to a security than something like proof of work. Having said that, mining a proof of work, coin, like Bitcoin, requires a really large initial investment. And when you're doing that, you have an expectation of profit as well. So there are certain things like how we test as a framework for deciding if something is security has served well in the past. Does it apply to digital assets? I think many would say yes. I'm actually not sold, but it does. But if we're judging everything through the how we test framework, then I think proof of work is probably a little bit safer from a regulatory standpoint. Daniel Snyder: Interesting take. I love that. Let's go ahead and transition though because we got to dive into your top token idea of 2023. I think that's what everybody's talking about right now. So what's your top idea? Why does it make sense to you? What's the advantages of it? Why don't you just give us the rundown? Mike Fay : Sure. Okay. So my top idea for this year is MATIC Polygon. It is a level two scaling blockchain built on Ethereum. They had a great run last year already. So a lot of people I think in the space think it's already had its move, and that's possible. But what I think is interesting about Polygon is for an industry that is supposed to be decentralized, Polygon is actually very centralized. And the reason why it is is because it is really marketed as, like, an enterprise solution, which is why you've had companies like Starbucks use it. You've had companies like Reddit use it. So what has been able to happen with Polygon is people are buying NFTs without realizing that they're NFTs, right? And that's really the whole - that that's the killer catalyst with public blockchain is when you can get people to use it without realizing that they're using it. Trump just did this. He just did his NFT thing. He used Polygon for that, right? So Polygon, in my view, is a great bet because I think that even if you have a broad crypto winter, because this is a blockchain that is serving real businesses like Starbucks or Reddit. Disney had it in its accelerator program last year. Because you have this one chain that is actually serving real businesses outside of the crypto space, I think, you have a level of support here that means the floor is a little bit lower than maybe some of the other or a little higher, excuse me, a little - the floor were closer to it than some of the other assets. And specifically, because it's building on Ethereum, I think that 2021, 2022 to a degree was very much about the ease killer, right? Because there's so many problems with Ethereum. If you think about the blockchain dilemma, the Ethereum problem is scalability, right? It has security, it doesn't have scalability. So you need other ways to scale the chain. And we've seen that the L2 is the layer 2 scaling chains like Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), Arbitrum, Optimism ( OP-USD ). These are growing faster than all of the competing L1 chains. Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), looks like it peaked. Solana ( SOL-USD ), huge problems there. Aptos ( APT-USD ), we'll find out it's a newer one. Some of the early stuff looks good, but it's very investor heavy, very VC heavy. Generally, people on crypto try to avoid that kind of stuff. And I would say that that's probably a wise thing to do. So MATIC, Polygon, to me, scales Ethereum. It provides value to Ethereum, it does the things that you would like to see a public blockchain do if you believe that public blockchain has a future, which is namely onboard in real life businesses. Daniel Snyder: Now let's rewind a second and I'm on a link to the article and the show notes for everybody that you did a great job breaking down the Starbucks utilization of how they're going to use Polygon, but Reddit was another big name. I mean, these are big company names, right? Maybe you can just, for the people that are listening right now, breakdown, what did Reddit do in order to make their NFT, but not NFT kind of work with Polygon? Mike Fay : The Reddit project with Polygon is really interesting because it uses profile pictures, right? And any social media platform has a profile picture, I actually just changed mine on Twitter the other day. If you use any social media, if you have a picture of yourself, that's great. But a lot of times, you don't have a picture of yourself, you have something else. And these are just basically called avatars, right? And so we've seen in the gaming community, we've seen in some of the social media channels that people generally don't like NFTs. They see them as scammy. They see them as money grabs. But if you name them something else, instead of sell - selling the NFT - as an NFT, if you sell it as an avatar picture that's exclusive that can't be duplicated and that you own. Suddenly, it's okay. And so what happened was Reddit was able to onboard millions, literally millions of people by selling these avatars on the blockchain that are fundamentally NFTs. And people were fine with it. They liked it. They liked to collect them. And what's interesting is in a lot of other NFT projects on Ethereum or Algorand ( ALGO-USD ) or any other way or one chain, oftentimes, you see a lot of people buy up a ton of them because they're speculating and they want to try to bet on other people wanting the avatars. And that really hasn't won the case with Reddit. You have a very high degree of unique buyers. So people are buying these to actually use them. And not only is it a validation of utility of public blockchain, but it's interesting because it might validate avatar NFTs, too, which is something that I'm personally not that high on, but it's working for Polygon. And I think that it's a very primitive use for a public blockchain, but it can lead to other things. It can lead to domains. It can lead to certifying real goods and assets. So it's important. Daniel Snyder: No, Mike, I got to say, I hear from people that are cautious in regards to tokens, especially after the FTX, all of me to blow up, right? Like, they were just printing tokens whenever they wanted tokens. What makes MATIC different from this unlimited token extravaganza? Mike Fay : Well, MATIC is actually one that has a limited supply and it's actually fairly close to that circulating. The circulating supply is very close to the max supply. So what you'll have is you'll have ultimately, you'll have a - if MATIC is continued to be needed as a chain, just to pay the gas fees, the transaction costs, a price that organically should rise over time. And it doesn't have to be a super hype-driven rise where it goes up 50% in a week. That's not sustainable and that's not good. But if the chain has utility and MATIC Polygon does because it's inexpensive to use, it's easily been positioned as the enterprise solution of choice, there's nothing stopping anyone from making another social media platform. There's nothing stopping anyone from making another Netflix ( NFLX ), right? But the reason why these companies survive is because they have network effects. They have some sort of IP maybe or they have some sort of relationship, something that differentiates them. And for Polygon, I think, it stands the test of time because a lot of these other competing chains that can just kind of be created out of nowhere, they lack that that relationship, right? They lack that that ability to appeal to somebody in a C-suite and say, “Hey, I can do this for you.” Daniel Snyder: So let's rewind it as well back to because you mentioned Polygon is within the Disney Accelerator program for this go around. Have you thought about, like, what you're kind of possibly expecting the results of that being? Because, I mean, you look at the companies that have been in that program before, whether it's Unity or whoever else. I mean, they usually team up with those companies for the long-term. Mike Fay : They tried to. And that's the end game, I think, for Disney. At minimum, I think you see digital collectibles of some sort. So Anna and Elsa NFTs, right? Maybe they're - they do some sort of digital collectible as an image or as an accessory. Maybe they do something with GamFi, which is something that I think people think that blockchain could potentially be useful in. It's funny because I actually asked Ethan Buchman, who's the Co-founder of Cosmos. I asked him from the perspective of a skeptic, what is public blockchain used for? What do you even do with it? Why do you need it? And he's basically made the case that it's the same thing as the Internet, right? People didn't even know what e-mail was 20 years ago, 25 years ago, really. So when I say as a base case, digital collectibles for Disney, I think that's true, but ultimately, they could do a number of things. They could literally sell media on the public blockchain if that's what they ended up wanting to do. Daniel Snyder: Interesting. So I just want to make sure we clarify for the listener. When it comes to this Polygon, this is your top token idea for 2023. So this is a long-term investment for you within this space, correct? Mike Fay : Absolutely. Daniel Snyder: And then to follow that up, what would be the risk management, in particular, for this position going forward? Mike Fay : I think if it ends up becoming more valuable than something like EVE or Bitcoin, you need to take some off, right? I don't think you want it to be the biggest position in your portfolio. it could be. It depends on what your personal risk tolerance is, right? For me, if I feel like it's at a maturity from how it can be used, then I'm looking to take some off. But the other thing, too, to consider is that Polygon works great right now, but it may not be as necessary in 5 to 10 years if Ethereum actually can do things to the native chain to scale itself. But that doesn't necessarily mean that Polygon goes away. It just might mean that polygon is done growing. Because what happens between these two chains is you have to bridge from one to the other. So if I were to make an NFT on Polygon, and I wanted to move it to Ethereum, I would have to pay a gas fee to do that. And you get to a point where it's not economically viable to do that. So, so long as Polygon continues to grow, I think it's a great investment. If it stops growing, takes them off. If it gets too big, takes them off. That's kind of how I see the exit strategy. Daniel Snyder: But we'll definitely keep an eye on that within your service. Mike, I can't thank you enough, man. Thank you so much for the time today. Breaking down the top token idea that you've brought for the year. I can't wait to follow-up with you. Maybe here in six months or whenever we have you on next to see how it's doing, see your updated response about the utility aspect of it. Before we get out of here, where can people find you and stay in touch with you and just learn more? Mike Fay : Of course, thanks again for having me. I'm on Twitter and my handle is really simple. It's just faybomb, F-A-Y-B-O-M-B, college nickname. I didn't give it myself thrown at me. And then, obviously, on Seeking Alpha. I'm Mike Fay on Seeking Alpha, my professional name there. And I post a lot about crypto on Seeking Alpha publicly as well. You're probably going to find the stuff that I don't think are great investments on the public site. But I do cover other things. I cover stocks. I cover media. I do still write about precious metal. And then, of course, BlockChain Reaction is the marketplace service. In that service, I'm going to share the occasional trade alert, which have been phenomenal. I'm - I don't want to toot my own horn, but I get myself a pat on the back to the trade alerts have all done very well. And then the top ideas. I try to provide two top ideas every month. These are things that I think are long-term holds that I want to see how they mature. So things like MATIC, right? And that's really, I think, the focal sell of the service is these top ideas. If you're a serious investor, who wants to look at crypto, I think BlockChain Reaction is a great service for you to consider. And as, of course, there's a chat in there as well. So you can talk to me, you can reach out, you can ask me questions directly or in the group, and I'm very open to talking. Daniel Snyder: That's awesome. Mike, thank you so much once again. Really appreciate it. And like I said, we're all going to keep an eye on Polygon. So now the pressure is on, my friend. So we'll take… Mike Fay : Thanks again for having me.

7770906,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516719,1674145240,"If Any Crypto Will Reach $1 Trillion, It’s Ethereum, Not Bitcoin: Dragonfly Capital","Based on the year-to-date performance and their drawdown from their all-time highs (ATHs), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have performed very similarly. While BTC has risen by 25.5% since the beginning of the year, ETH has climbed by about 27%. From its ATH, Bitcoin has declined by 69.9%, while Ether is down by 68.9%. Despite this very comparable performance, the debate persists that Ethereum may replace (“flip”) Bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap within the next few years or in the next bull cycle. One supporter of this theory is Dragonfly Capital’s Haseeb Qureshi. In a recent interview, the investment firm’s managing partner said that if any cryptocurrency is ever going to reach $1 trillion, it will be Ethereum. His reasoning? Institutional investors who need to align buying with their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) agenda: You need institutional buyers to be willing to buy this thing in size and Ethereum is really the only game in town if you are an institutional buyer. Furthermore, the expert expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult for institutions to justify Bitcoin as an investment. “I see it a lot because we work a lot with big institutions . It’s explicitly something that gets more and more of a concern for them. They want to invest in crypto, but it has to be compliant with their ESG mandate,” Qureshi said. 2.

John J. Ray III, who previously handled Enron’s restructuring, said that despite the accusations of criminal misconduct against former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives, customers have lauded FTX's technology and said it could be worth reviving the exchange.  “Everything is on the table,” Ray told the Journal. “If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.”  The FTX token FTT was trading up 33% on Binance on the news.  The decision would come down to whether restarting FTX's international exchange would recover more for customers than just liquidating assets or selling the platform, Ray said.  In the interview, Ray also criticized Bankman-Fried's comments to the media and elsewhere as being unhelpful. Bankman-Fried has said FTX did not need to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and has been critical of Ray's decisions.  “We don’t need to be dialoguing with him,” Ray said. “He hasn’t told us anything that I don’t already know.”  In a text message to the Journal, Bankman-Fried responded, “This is a shocking and damning comment from someone pretending to care about customers.”  In a tweet after the WSJ article was published, Bankman-Fried wrote that he was ""glad Mr. Ray is finally paying lip service to turning the exchange back on after months of squashing such efforts!""

This will be the 13th upgrade made to the Tezos network. This upgrade will implement various new features. The main features include transfer tickets between accounts and a much shorter block time of 15 seconds. Related Reading: Solana Gleams 30% In Last 7 Days As SOL Bulls Try To Break $21 Barrier Further, this upgrade will add Epoxy, a new technology on Mainnet, which is precisely a validity rollup that can also be referred to as a new layer 2 scaling solution. The Mainnet will gain further strength due to Epoxy, which introduces SNARKs’ proof-of-validity, which will be the reason for quicker transactions. This 13th upgrade, which is called the ‘Mumbai Upgrade’ will be implemented after a number of tests are carried out. However, once implemented, the system will get closer to Tezos’ target of achieving one million transactions per second, according to the Nomadic Lab’s report. The implementation of the upgrade will, as a consequence, increase the value of Tezos’ native token XTZ. The price of the altcoin, XTZ, has reacted positively to this development. XTZ experienced a price reversal, but the altcoin has since resumed its bullish momentum. Tezos Price Analysis: One-Day Chart XTZ was trading at $0.99 at the time of writing. Although the coin started to retrace over the 48 hours, it has regained bullish momentum on the chart. The altcoin has formed a prominent cup-and-handle trading pattern, which is an extension of bullish momentum. This change in price momentum can be attributed to the announcement of the ‘Mumbai Upgrade’. Immediate resistance to XTZ stands at $1.02, but the coin is expected to retrace to $0.97. Once it reaches the $0.97 mark, Tezos can target $1.19, which will mean an 18% appreciation. Over the last week, the coin managed to surge over 8%. The amount of XTZ traded in the last session increased, signifying an increased amount of buying. Technical Analysis XTZ had secured a multi-month high with regard to the buying pressure it witnessed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) touched the 80 mark a few trading sessions ago, signifying an overvalued tendency. Often, a coin that is overbought experiences a price correction and a fall in demand; Tezos also displayed the same, but at press time, the RSI again noted an uptick. This uptick could mean that the altcoin might head back close to the 80-mark. This unusual uptick can be because of the newest development. On the same note, XTZ rose above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), which indicated that buyers were driving the price momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops To $20,700 As Miner Outflows Surge The coin was above the 50-SMA (yellow) line too. So with increased accumulation, XTZ can soon breach the 200-SMA (green) line. Overall, Tezos remains quite optimistic on the chart; however, the coin has to remain above its local support line of $0.97 for the uptrend to continue.

Susannah Maybank, who spent years in fine art, is building Tonic.xyz, a non-fungible token (NFT) gallery focused on curating generative art collections by providing artists the infrastructure to mint their code on-chain.  Maybank co-founded Tonic with Mariam Naficy, founder of online design marketplace Minted. The first collection on Tonic will launch Jan. 31 andfeature a generative art collection from Jaime Derringer, artist and founder of publication Design Milk.  Generative art has had its moment in a chilling crypto winter, where artists such as Tyler Hobbs and Erick Calderon have produced successful collections on generative art platform Art Blocks.  Maybank told CoinDesk that not only does generative art provide artists an ongoing relationship with collectors, but the code allows artists to create a narrative expressed over a larger collection.  “Our entire lives are mediated through digital means, largely. It's amazing that now we have this creative medium that speaks to that reality that we can get excited about,” said Maybank.  In addition to helping artists mint their collections, Tonic will work to help onboard non-crypto native buyers and other individuals who come from the fine art world. Maybank is dedicated to merging the physical and digital through Web3, offering real-world derivatives of the NFT pieces that buyers can display in their homes.  “I'm not an artist. That's not how I'm supposed to contribute,” said Maybank. “But I do really believe that I'm supposed to help introduce incredible artists to a broader audience, and that's a fundamental part of my job.”  Read More: What Are Generative Art NFTs?",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/19/former-gagosian-head-of-digital-builds-generative-art-gallery-tonicxyz,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ed4e5184f5e37701e1ab2c6f96431d2cbea12d4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7769336,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516779,1674142127,"Bitcoin Bulls Hold The Line At $20,700, But Bigger Losses Are Imminent?","Bitcoin lost steam the previous day and seems poised to re-test its support levels in the coming days. The cryptocurrency rallied on the back of favorable macroeconomic winds and high upside liquidity from overleveraged short traders. Related Reading: Solana Gleams 30% In Last 7 Days As SOL Bulls Try To Break $21 Barrier As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $20,800 with a 3% loss in the last 24 hours. BTC remained positive during the previous seven days and recorded a 16% profit. The number one crypto by market capitalization is the best performer in the top 10. The Biggest Obstacle For Bitcoin In The Short Term NewsBTC reported that short positions were piling up as Bitcoin trended to the upside. The market took out over half a billion dollars in short positions. As the market trended upside, these positions were liquidated, allowing BTC to continue climbing. In that sense, Bitcoin might keep trending upwards but at a slower pace. As the market ate off those shorts during the past week, over-confident long positions might become the target. This shift might push BTC back to the critical supports at $19,600 to $19,700. These levels have confluence with the 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 50x leverage longs. Thus, there is a high liquidity pool sitting at those levels, ready to be taken by market movers. On higher timeframes, a recent report from QCP Capital claims the macroeconomic winds might change and could negatively impact crypto. 2023 kicked off with a positive outlook on critical metrics, such as inflation, and high expectations of a monetary pivot by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The financial institution has been hiking interest rates and unloading its balance sheet to combat inflation. This metric has been at its highest level in the last 40 decades. Markets Will Take A “Rude Shock?” Recent data shows inflation is declining; this trend might support the Fed’s slowdown on its monetary policy and provide room for Bitcoin and risk on assets to rally. However, QCP Capital believes that while Q1, 2023 might be positive for these assets, Q2 could see some hurdles: While we expect the 1 February FOMC to push back strongly against this pricing, we believe the 22 March FOMC will be the moment of truth, when updated rate forecasts will be released. Should there be no adjustment to the median 2023 dot, then we expect markets will be in for a rude shock. The fact that Bitcoin and some stocks have been rallying is evidence of “how quickly financial conditions have loosened,” the firm believes. The Fed has been fighting against this economic environment, so its return could push the financial institution to tighten its monetary policy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops To $20,700 As Miner Outflows Surge For this time next year, the market is expecting much lower interest rates, as seen in the chart above.

42388216,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR99Xz,1674137629,Crypto Trading Giant QCP Capital Expects Fed to Be Irate as Financial Conditions Ease,"""Don't fight the Fed"" has been one of the most voiced mantras on Wall Street.  Yet, that's precisely what investors have done in recent weeks. Despite the Federal Reserve's repeated warnings of continued liquidity tightening ahead, there has been a risk revival in almost all corners of the financial market, including retail-dominated meme stocks and dog-themed cryptocurrencies.  That has the crypto options trading firm QCP Capital now worried about a Fed pushback.  ""What will raise the FOMC's [Federal Open Market Committee] ire is how quickly financial conditions have loosened in this period which, together with the rally of meme stocks and crypto, risks severely derailing their inflation fight,"" QCP Capital's insights team said in a note published Thursday.  ""While we expect the Feb. 1 FOMC meeting to push back strongly against this pricing, we believe the March 22 FOMC will be the moment of truth, when updated rate forecasts will be released. Should there be no adjustment to the median 2023 dot plot, then we expect markets will be in for a rude shock,"" QCP added. The Singapore-based options trading giant is one of the few firms that warned of a Fed-induced market swoon before it began in late 2021.  The central bank raised rates from zero to 4.25% last year and plans to lift them further this year to levels above 5% and keep them elevated for some time, as Fed President Jerome Powell signaled in December and several Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members have suggested since then.  The interest rate ""dot plot"" published by the FOMC in December showed the median rate at the end of 2023 at 5.1%, a significant upward revision from 4.6% at the September 2022 projection.  The Fed expects financial conditions to tighten when fighting inflation with liquidity-sucking measures such as interest rate hikes. Financial conditions tighten when bond yields rise, credit spreads widen, stock prices fall and the U.S. dollar strengthens.  However, the opposite has happened, complicating the Fed's effort to control the general price level in the economy by tightening credit standards and weakening demand-pull inflation.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, has dropped by 11% since late September. The S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, has bounced 12% in three months, while the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen by nearly 100 basis points to 3.38%. Other risk assets such as bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, have gained over 25% this month, according to CoinDesk data. If that's not enough, shiba inu, the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, has rallied 35% this month and meme stock Bed Bath & Beyond has jumped 56%.  Bloomberg's financial conditions index has turned positive for the first time since April 2022, when the fed funds rate stood between 0.25% and 0.5%. In other words, markets have undone nearly 400 basis points worth of Fed tightening.  The premature easing could be attributed to hopes that falling inflation expectations and signs of economic slowdown would force the Fed to cut rates later this year has powered.  ""The excesses of the prior inflationary regime are starting to reemerge. The meme stock basket is now up 25%, while altcoins like solana have doubled in value in less than a month. Total [non-fungible token] market cap has quietly crept up close to last year's high levels of 9 million-9.5 million ETH, worth $13.3 billion at today's prices,"" QCP said, while noting that the rebound may not be long lasting.  ""While we wrote in our first market update of the year that NFT prices were a harbinger for a broader rally to come, we do not expect those to be sustained while the Fed is still on a warpath against inflation, and all the assets that feed it,"" QCP added.  Bitcoin changed hands at $20,700 at press time. While the Fed is likely to stay hawkish, the U.S. Treasury Department's decision to run down its cash holdings to avoid a government shutdown may damp the Fed's tightening to some extent in coming weeks.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/19/crypto-trading-giant-qcp-capital-predicts-irate-fed-as-financial-conditions-ease,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e022331b0eb545d717169db0795c4f0cb77714f2-1920x1278.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Currently under debate, the bill could enable blockchain technology to be used as a way to store trade documents electronically. Under current regulations these documents need to be kept and transported in paper form which can be a cumbersome task, Hannah Gilbert, policy adviser at the UK Chamber of Shipping explained. Tests have proven electronic documents can be transported in minutes, as opposed to the current system where they must pass through numerous parties, Gilbert said.  “This bill provides a lot of opportunity for business,” Gilbert said.  Chris Southworth, secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce, said the bill could have an impact globally. It is a 1.2 trillion pound opportunity for the Commonwealth, an association consisting of 56 countries, he claimed. He called the proposed law ""a template,"" one that could facilitate talks with countries like Singapore, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, among others, that are considering their own versions.  Though hacking remains an issue, electronic documents still are safer and more secure than paper documents, Sean Edwards, chairman of the International Trade and Forfaiting Association, said.  The Electronic Trade Document Bill will continue being debated in Parliament's second chamber, the House of Lords.

7767024,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570879-gbtc-discount-to-nav-closes?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1674137025,Grayscale Bitcoin Trust: Discount To NAV Closes,"Summary In the past month, GBTC's discount to NAV has shifted from around 48% to 36% while bitcoin has rallied. This is likely a result of a sentiment shift in the crypto market, rather than any fundamental news regarding GBTC itself. We are fading this move; in the last couple days, we shifted our GBTC into BITO and sold covered-calls against the new position. As we covered in our article on Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) the risk of the assets within the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) not being there is not a real risk in our opinion, and there are no real risks in the case of DCG going bankrupt. With that being said, as the market has realized the lack of risk in this regard the discount to NAV has closed drastically. The discount dropped from over 48% all the way down to 36% in the past month, to levels before any of these fears surfaced. Data by YCharts With this it begs the question of if the discount to NAV at this stage is justified, particularly now that there is elevated perceived risk and mistrust in GBTC, Grayscale, and their parent company DCG. Revisiting the SEC suit There has been some updates in this regard, which may explain the discount to NAV closing - namely: The SEC has argued that GBTC shouldn't be converted to an ETF and that Bitcoin Futures like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) holds are ""fundamentally different products protected by different market-surveillance mechanisms and regulatory oversight to detect and deter fraud and manipulation."" Grayscale has responded claiming the SEC's central premise ""that the Exchange's surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME provides adequate protection against fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin futures market but not the spot bitcoin market-is illogical."" Both of these arguments were expected from both sides - so effectively nothing has changed here beyond the court process moving along and a decision being a bit closer. Grayscale is clearly on the right side of things here and the SEC is being unreasonable in my view, however I do not have faith the courts will be unbiased in this matter. This could be one reason the discount to NAV has closed though, as institutions have been reminded how strong Grayscale's case is here. Revisiting the digital currency group FUD The FUD has largely disappeared in the rearview mirror in the past few weeks, however in the past few days it has begun ramping up again - with the DCG's CEO Barry Silbert being accused of stalling the inevitable - repaying creditors and likely bankruptcy - by many folks. One of the Winklevoss twins has begun advocating for Barry Silbert to be disposed of as CEO of DCG, and generally the FUD is ramping up again. This all points to the fears of bankruptcy, uncertainty regarding GBTC, and all the fears we had in late November and December will return in the coming weeks, likely causing the discount to NAV to increase once again. As we pointed out before in our article on Grayscale Ethereum Trust DCG going bankrupt could be positive for investors if they decide to simply close the Grayscale Funds, however this situation remains unlikely. The more likely scenario is DCG selling Grayscale and its funds to another asset manager and them continuing to be ran as they are rather than being closed. Revisiting Bitcoin's price action Finally one last thing to revisit is Bitcoin's price itself, as due to the underlining asset being Bitcoin GBTC's price action is predominantly determined by Bitcoin's price action. Data by YCharts While sentiment has shifted and bitcoin has moved off its lows, sentiment has shifted positive, there doesn't appear to be any real catalysts for a higher move up in my view. Inflation is still quite high, interest rates continue going up and are likely to be sustained throughout 2023, there is still plenty of uncertainty regarding a potential recession and the consequences of it on the crypto market, the halvening is quite a bit away... Worst of all institutions want nothing to do with bitcoin or crypto broadly - atleast until regulation comes, and arguably most people feel the same way after the collapse of FTX and other large crypto platforms. Where does this leave us? This actual risks related to DCG bankruptcy is now being priced relatively efficiently in my view, however the market risk is now being underpriced as fear can and likely will expand the risk-premium in time. Any bad news, be it Cathie Woods selling out of GBTC, or DCG going bankrupt, will spark the same fears and doubt - of uncertainty - and likely cause an expansion of the discount once again. With Bitcoin having no real catalyst in the short-term and plenty of potential downside catalysts there are plenty of risks here from the NAV side as well. What are we doing? We decided to shift from GBTC into BITO once again as the discount to NAV is relatively fair once again in our opinion, while we believe bitcoin is slightly expensive given the macro environment and general positioning of the crypto market. This decision is done as we believe the upside risk in the discount to NAV of GBTC is equal to the downside risk - and thus there is no real arbitrage to be had there. We can generate a little yield selling covered calls in BITO without being exposed to discount to NAV risk or selling out completely and that's perfect for our current assumptions. It might not be right for you. Rating & risks to consider Before closing this out I want to be clear - there are many risks here still and engaging in trading these derivatives of bitcoin carries extra risk, as does selling options against them (covered-calls). There are also potential tax consequences in swapping GBTC out for BITO that would make it a bad choice for you personally - please do not follow what we are doing, we have different circumstances, risk tolerance, and tax positioning than you do. With that being said we'd rate GBTC at a hold to situational sell relative to Bitcoin or S&P 500 ( SPY ) and a modest short-term sell relative to dollars. We'd change our rating of GBTC to a buy at a 40-42%+ discount to NAV and/or Bitcoin being",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570879-gbtc-discount-to-nav-closes?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7767024.jpeg

The funding round, led by Polychain Capital, values =nil; Foundation, which started in 2018 as a research collective but has transitioned into a more traditional startup, at $220 million, according to a statement from the firm. (And no, “=nil;” is not a typo, but a company name playfully – if confusingly – borrowed from programmer-speak for zero.)  “Proof Market, a trustless data accessibility protocol, enables layer 1 and 2 blockchains and protocols to generate zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs on demand for seamless data-sharing without reliance on centralized intermediaries,” =nil; explained in a statement obtained by CoinDesk.  Read more: Zero-Knowledge Cryptography in 2023: The Year Privacy Becomes Practical  ZK cryptography is increasingly common throughout the blockchain industry, with applications ranging from privacy and security to data compression. The tech allows one to “prove” a statement is true by generating a string of letters and characters, a “ZK proof,” for a so-called verifier. The verifier runs that proof through a kind of cryptographic checker – a computer algorithm that uses fancy mathematics to confirm the statement without needing any details beyond the gibberish proof itself.  The ZK marketplace, still in testing, is aimed towards democratizing the production of ZK proofs, making it easier for upstart ZK protocols to get going in a decentralized manner.  Zero-knowledge technology has become a core component for countless crypto protocols, powering everything from Ethereum scaling systems such as zkSync and Starknet to privacy chains like Zcash and Mina. But ZK protocol developers routinely face challenges stemming from the fact that generating proofs is a costly, technically complex and time-consuming endeavor.  Such barriers complicate the development of ZK platforms, whose trustworthiness is generally premised on the idea of allowing anyone – or at least a big pool of volunteers – to generate ZK proofs as a way of decentralizing trust. Today, many ZK platforms are producing the proofs themselves or are outsourcing the task to hand-picked partners, negating most of the tech’s purported benefits in the name of bootstrapping.  With the Proof Marketplace, protocols in need of ZK proofs will be able to pay trusted third parties to generate them. For instance, a ZK blockchain bridge can use the Proof Marketplace to pay a third party to generate a proof representing the bridge’s state (without the project needing to recruit and sustain a dedicated prover community itself).  =nil;’s Proof Marketplace is generally blockchain-agnostic, meaning projects across ecosystems will be able to buy and sell proofs.

CleanSpark has managed to capitalize on the bear market, buying up distressed assets while its peers are facing bankruptcies and looming debt.  In August, the miner bought a 36 MW mining site in Washington, Georgia, including 3,400 rigs installed in the site for $25.1 million, amid a splurge of other acquisitions during the summer. The Washington site had the exclusive rights to another 50 MW of power, which CleanSpark is now building out, said a Thursday press release.  Once completed, the 50MW will yield computing power between 1.6 exahash/second (EH/s) to 2.2 EH/s, depending on what mining machines are installed, which will either be Bitmain Antminer S19j Pros and Antminer S19 XPs, the press release said.  CleanSpark increased its computing power threefold in 2022, and it now has 6.5 EH/s, or about 2.4% of the computing power on the bitcoin network.  Shares of CleanSpark have fallen almost 80% from its 2022 high of $12.53 to $2.53 at Wednesday's close, which is fairly in line with the performance of its peers.

Genesis is in confidential negotiations with various creditor groups, with the company warning it could seek bankruptcy protection if it fails to raise capital, a Bloomberg report said. Since the collapse and bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX in November, Genesis has been scrambling to raise fresh capital or reach a deal with creditors. Digital Currency Group owns both Genesis and CoinDesk.  Binance was named as a counterparty in an order against the little-known Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange, Bitzlato. The exchange was accused of laundering $700 million by U.S. authorities on Wednesday. Binance was named as the top three receiving and sending counterparties associated with Bitzlato, according to the order from the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). ""Approximately two-thirds of Bitzlato’s top receiving and sending counterparties are associated with darknet markets or scams,” the order said. “For example, Bitzlato’s top receiving counterparty, by total amount of BTC received between May 2018 and September 2022 was Binance.”  Bitcoin was trading down on the day following news of a pending U.S. Justice Department announcement of a major international cryptocurrency enforcement action on Wednesday.

Chart of the Day  The chart compares bitcoin's price with its 14-day relative strength index (RSI), a technical analysis tool used to gauge momentum, going back to 2016.  The RSI recently rose past 80 to its highest since 2019 as bitcoin rallied to a two-month high.  A reading above-80 indicates an asset is overbought. However, that's not always the case.  ""The relative strength index, a momentum indicator, ripped higher throughout the last week and pushed toward 2019 highs. This supports that the rally is extended in the short term. However, it also represents the first proper signal of strengthening momentum in BTC since the bull market of 2021,"" Arcane Research's weekly note said.  ""The current recovery resembles BTC’s initial recovery from the depths of the 2018 bear market. After RSI pushed above 80 in April 2019 following a relative volatility compression in March, BTC stayed rangebound for 40 days. Now, BTC has recovered to its Q3 range, the RSI is extended, and shorts are cautious, increasing the likelihood of near-term stability,"" Arcane Research added.  – Omkar Godbole     Trending Posts  OKX Publishes Proof-of-Reserves Report Showing $7.5B in ‘Clean Assets’  Ether, Bitcoin Long Traders See $110M Liquidations on Bitzlato Induced Volatility  Crypto Exchange BitMart to Join Custodian Copper’s ClearLoop Network",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/19/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-tops-21k-outshines-sp-500-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1745f035632a2507693183139b51c8979e73f74-1098x573.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411260,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMW9b,1674135900,2023: The Year Regulators Finally Grasp Crypto?,"2023 seems to have gotten off to a pretty good start for the digital assets space.  Instability at several crypto projects seems to have at least temporarily resolved itself, and it’s been a few weeks since the last disastrous headlines.  Asset prices are up, crypto miners are reportedly ready to reboot their rigs and retail speculators are once again hungrily eyeing the markets.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Regulatory frameworks lie ahead  Despite recent crypto market buoyancy and enthusiasm, we should not so quickly forget about the challenges of 2022.  For one thing, many of the structural difficulties for the crypto markets remain in place, according to ZK Zheng, CEO of ZX Squared, a crypto hedge fund.  “2023 continues to be challenging for investors especially during the first half of the year when the [Federal Reserve] is still hawkish, raising interest rates to control the inflation,” Zheng said. “The current crypto bear market cycle may end when the Fed stops raising interest rates (hopefully by the second half of the year), and any remaining leverage in the crypto market is eliminated. This includes debt borrowing related to certain major market participants (investment firms, distressed assets, mining companies, etc.).”  Several of the notable developments last year will help set the course for this year – not only the failures of FTX and Three Arrows Capital, but also the ongoing work to create a regulatory framework for digital assets in the financial industry undertaken by government agencies.  Read more: Crypto Speculation Has Had Its 'Comeuppance': Raghuram Rajan  With some of the more spectacular crashes in the digital assets space in 2022, combined with the growing links between cryptocurrencies and the traditional financial system, 2023 is a year in which regulators will need to play a more central role, according to Zheng.  “A crypto regulatory framework needs to be further established and clarified for a new crypto bull market to come,” Zheng said. “It is absolutely imperative to have regulatory audits and transparencies to ensure that stablecoins are fully collateralized and centralized exchanges (CEX) are well capitalized to avoid the repeats of the [Terra] and FTX failures. This may also include a measure on how to handle the counterparty credit risks which were at the heart of the domino effects during this crypto winter.”  Regulatory emphasis at Davos  Nigel Green, the CEO of one of the world’s largest wealth management firms, deVere Group, struck a similar tone.  This week, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he urged world leaders and influencers to address the issue of cryptocurrency regulations.  “The time for endless platitudes on greater regulatory scrutiny is over. Action is required,” he said in a statement. “Should those in attendance at the WEF not advance the agenda of crypto regulation as a result of the 2023 summit, they will have spectacularly failed.”  Read more: World Leaders Warmed to Blockchain at Davos This Year, Despite Crypto Winter  Green offered three reasons the globe’s leaders need to get serious about crypto regulation:  Crypto’s growing role in the financial system  The need for greater scrutiny to protect investors in the wake of collapses like Three Arrows Capital and FTX  The importance of boosting economies in emerging countries  Any regulatory framework must balance protecting investors and the financial system with the decentralized nature of digital assets and the need for freedom to innovate, according to Green.  Green also recently commented on the recovery in digital asset prices, noting that the recent crypto winter appears to be thawing.  “Of course, the crypto market will not go in a straight line – no market ever does – but we expect the bears to go into hibernation and bulls are ready to run,” he said in comments made over the weekend.  Zheng said regulatory clarity is necessary for a long-term return to investor optimism.  “Crypto market cycles come and go,” Zheng said. “This time is no different than the previous three extreme bear market cycles during Bitcoin's 14-year short history. The crypto market is driven by fear and greed, just like any other financial markets. Bitcoin's long-term thesis is still intact. Crypto investor confidence will return especially when the market becomes more appropriately regulated for institutional investors.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/19/2023-the-year-regulators-finally-grasp-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f2f94b3d504722e4c0379de274e7320f7b2a543-5120x3413.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: LUNC Network Upgrade Backed By Major Exchanges – Will The Crypto Balloon In Price? Solana Keeps Things Aglow The Solana ecosystem is touted as an “Ethereum killer” as it rose in prominence due to its low transaction fees and its capability to go through thousands of transactions per second. Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, called the ecosystem “underrated” last year. This connection with SBF and FTX led to both the ecosystem and the token to take a plunge, losing nearly half of its value. SOL total market cap at $7.6 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Because of this, the team behind the network made efforts to distance itself from FTX and Bankman-Fried. The Messari overview which was commissioned by the Solana Foundation, detailed how things went down with regards the crypto exchange and its former big boss.

And with the release of BONK during the rally, the network usage of SOL shot upwards, adding on to the already solid trajectory that SOL has. Source: Alchemy Despite the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that plagued the ecosystem, Solana is still considered as a fast growing ecosystem, according to a recent report, which shows that the development on the network is increasing compared to its competitors. 1/ A new report by @ElectricCapital shows that Solana is the fastest growing developer ecosystem, surpassing 2,000 total developers in 2022.

At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $20.63, up 30% in the last seven days. Rejection Line And What It Means Meanwhile, the token was rejected at $25, which could mean that bears will be able to test the two support levels that helped SOL reach its peak price. In the next few days, SOL is seen retesting the $18 and $16 supports.

If $25 is broken, $30 should be the next target as a breakthrough in this area would give SOL bulls legroom for more upward movement.

Flashbots aims to mitigate the issues associated with centralized Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) on the Ethereum blockchain.  MEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block rewards and gas fees.

DVT refers to a technology development that would allow an Ethereum proof-of-stake validator to be run on more than one node simultaneously. The technology is a key component in Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum road map for decentralization.  Because of the high cost of entry to run a validator node, critics say that the Ethereum protocol is uncomfortably centralized across only a handful of major actors. While there are just over 500,000 validators, the majority are concentrated in a handful of pools: Lido has just over 25% of the validators in its pool, Coinbase (COIN) has 11.7%, Kraken has 7%, and Binance has 5.4%.  The fund is being led by SSV and Digital Currency Group (DCG). DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  In July, SSV launched a $10 million pool to distribute grants to build DVT projects using the SSV protocol. So far, it has granted $2 million, and high-performing grant recipients will be shortlisted for this new ecosystem fund. Grantees included Blockscape, ANKR, Stader and Moonshake.  ""It’s important because DVT is becoming a major focus for Ethereum,” Alon Muroch, technical lead, SSV Network, said to CoinDesk in a note. “More funds, companies, DAOs are getting involved. It’s going to be as widespread as layer 2s, and Maximal Extractable Value after the tech hits the Ethereum mainnet in 2023. The funds involved are at the ground level supporting this change.""

7765464,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516685,1674133326,"Bitcoin Drops To $20,700 As Miner Outflows Surge","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin miner outflows have surged, suggesting that selling from this cohort may be behind the crypto’s decline to $20,700. Bitcoin Miner Outflows Have Registered Multiple Spikes Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, on Wednesday, miners deposited 669 BTC to exchanges. A relevant indicator here is the “miner reserve,” which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that miners as a whole are currently holding in their wallets. The “miner outflow” is a metric that tells us the total number of coins that these blockchain validators are transferring out of the miner reserve right now. Naturally, the reserve’s value goes down whenever the outflow records a spike, given that an equal or higher amount of the crypto doesn’t flow inside at the same time. Generally, miners take BTC out of their reserve for selling purposes. Thus, whenever the outflow registers high values (or alternatively, the reserve observes a steep decline), it means this cohort might be participating in large amounts of selling at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner outflow and miner reserve over the past couple of months: The value of the reserve seems to have observed significant decline in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin miner outflow saw two very large spikes in the last few days. The spike on January 14 measured around 4,089 BTC, while the one on January 17 amounted to 2,500 BTC. Related Reading: Asian Traders Behind Most Of Bitcoin’s Recent Gains, Report Reveals At the same time as these outflows, their reserves also plunged, which means that there wasn’t much incoming volume to compensate for these outflows. On Wednesday, there was also a third spike, but it was significantly smaller in scale than the other two. However, there was still something about this outflow that’s worth paying attention to. About 669 BTC from this outflow was headed toward centralized exchanges. This can be seen in the data for the “miner to exchange flow” metric, which is also shown in the chart. Usually, exchanges are what investors use for quickly swapping their Bitcoin in favor of altcoins or stablecoins, or for simply withdrawing to fiat. While miner outflows alone can be a sign that there is some selling going on (as these holders may just use over-the-counter (OTC) deals instead of exchanges), deposits straight to exchanges do provide more evidence that selling could be the intent behind the outflows. While a part of the third outflow was headed toward the exchanges, the first two, larger spikes didn’t seem to have coincided with any significant deposits toward these platforms. Related Reading: Altcoin Indexes Outperform Bitcoin, Small Caps Lead Market Nonetheless, the fact remains that following the first two outflows, the Bitcoin rally slowed down to a crawl, and after the third one (that went towards exchanges), BTC outright declined and hit $20,700. This could suggest that selling from miners may have played some part in these developments in the asset’s price.

42388205,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR98dr,1674133200,Ransomware Variants Are on the Rise but Overall Gains Decline: Chainalysis,"In 2022, ransomware hackers received $456.8 million from their victims, 40% less than the $765.6 million they pocketed in 2021, said blockchain analytics company Chainalysis in a new report. The trend was earlier noticed by another analytics firm, Crystal Blockchain. But the actual amount of proceeds might be higher because not all the crypto wallets controlled by ransomware hackers can be identified.  The decline reflects general dynamics in the ransomware industry, but only partially. According to ransomware researcher Allan Liska, who is a consulting system engineer at FireEye, ransomware attacks decreased from 2,865 to 2,566 between 2021 and 2022.  These numbers come from Liska’s analysis of websites where hackers publish data stolen from the compromised companies, pressuring them to pay ransom. However, this 10.4% drop in attacks is still smaller than a 40.3% drop in overall ransomware revenue, Chainalysis said.  At the same time, the number of malicious programs attackers have been using to encrypt victims’ data “exploded in 2022,” the report reads. Cybersecurity firm Fortinet identified 10,666 new ransomware variants in the first half of 2022, compared to just 5,400 over the same period of 2021. However, only a few of the variants bring attackers significant gains: “the vast majority of ransomware revenue goes to a small group of strains at any given time,” Chainalysis said.  The reason researchers saw less money accruing to hackers last year is that the victims are becoming more reluctant to pay, Chainalysis said, citing cybersecurity firm Coveware. According to Coveware’s data, since 2019, the percentage of cases in which victims paid ransoms has fallen from 76% to 41%. One explanation for the drop might be the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control advisory in September 2021, which warned companies against potential sanctions violation for paying ransomware hackers.  Another reason may be that cyber insurance firms are now less willing to help their clients pay ransoms and insist on more stringent security measures to prevent attacks in the first place, the report says.  The sprawling ransomware market allows attackers to buy access to multiple strains and juggle between them, collecting revenues from multiple victims. At the same time, the lifespan of each code variant is getting shorter: In 2022, the average ransomware strain remained active for just 70 days, down from 153 days in 2021 and 265 days in 2020, Chainalysis said.  For example, the infamous Conti gang, which attacked the U.S. health care industry, among others, during the pandemic, got attacked itself after it “pledged alliance” to the Russian state in the war with Ukraine. After the group’s inside communications were leaked and published online (CoinDesk covered the leak last spring), Conti reportedly ceased operations.  However, Chainalysis found that the wallets associated with Conti’s leading figures continue to receive revenues from various ransomware attacks. For example, the groups’ administrator nicknamed Stern has “transacted with addresses linked to strains like Quantum, Karakurt, Diavol, and Royal in 2022 following Conti’s demise,” the report says.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/19/ransomware-variants-are-on-the-rise-but-overall-gains-decline-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f515531355d640116f6eb45e5a4526ea09087e13-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7763745,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516666,1674129640,Will Bitcoin Price Fall If Genesis Files For Bankruptcy? Here’s What We Know,"After the DXY fell intra-day to a new 7-month low of 101.56 yesterday, the Bitcoin price briefly managed to tackle the key resistance zone above the $21,500 mark, reaching its highest level since September 13, 2022, at $21,650. However, the euphoria did not last long for two reasons. First, the DXY showed a strong bounce, and second, news became public that Genesis Trading could be preparing for bankruptcy. This has stoked new fears that the contagion in the crypto market could roll on after the FTX bankruptcy in November. But what is known so far and what could this mean for the Bitcoin price? Here’s What’s Known According to a Bloomberg report yesterday, Genesis Trading, a subsidiary of crypto mogul Barry Silbert’s DCG empire, is facing bankruptcy. If the report proves true, the bankruptcy filing could come as early as this week, according to Bloomberg. Faced with a lack of liquidity, Genesis is currently in confidential negotiations with various creditor groups. Genesis and DCG have reportedly exchanged several proposals with creditors, but have so far failed to reach an agreement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Top In Short Term, Why Dips Might Be Attractive Genesis is working on a restructuring plan, according to informed sources. Some creditors apparently would be willing to accept a mix of cash and share certificates from DCG. However, the deal may not be ready yet, as Bloomberg reported yesterday. According to crypto author Samuel Andrew, citing sources close to DCG, talks are continuing and plans could still change. Andrew wrote today: UPDATE: The Genesis Trading news regarding a ‘pre-packaged bankruptcy’ is being refuted by several Genesis creditors that matter. **several sources claim that DCG/Genesis is leaking the pre-packaged bankruptcy narrative to force an agreement. Quote, ‘…far from a done deal.’ What Impact Will It Have On The Bitcoin Price? The impact of a Genesis bankruptcy on the Bitcoin price will likely depend largely on whether DCG will find a deal with Genesis’ creditors or whether DCG will be dragged into bankruptcy with them. Although details are not yet available, it seems likely that a “pre-packaged” deal could prevent a major market impact on Bitcoin price by preventing DCG’s insolvency and liquidation of Grayscale. Related Reading: Overbought Or Ready To Rip? Bitcoin Daily RSI Reaches Explosive Levels If there’s no deal, this could arguably result in the “cash cow” Grayscale having to be sold or DCG being forced to liquidate large chunks of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holdings. This is due to the fact that DCG owns Genesis money. The loans are $575 million due in 2023 and another $1.1 billion promissory note due in 2032 to Genesis. However, there are several factors still unclear. Thus, it’s still not clear if a Genesis bankruptcy will automatically result in DCG going down, depending on the question of if they can raise enough funds. Also, the liquidation of GBTC isn’t an easy task as it comes with high legal hurdles and requires the SEC’s approval. Accordingly, crypto influencer Lark Davis also commented via Twitter, “No indication yet on how this will affect DCG or the Grayscale Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts.” Hypothetically speaking, a liquidation of the entire GBTC could mean a massive dump if more than 630,000 BTC were flushed into the still illiquid market. Even if the liquidation were to take place over a period of several months, such selling pressure would likely drive the Bitcoin price significantly down. At press time, the Bitcoin price remained relatively stable despite the rumors and stood at $20,802.

BitMart will be joining Copper’s ClearLoop network subject to contracts and the completion of technical integration. Once completed, its institutional clients will be able to trade on the BitMart exchange while their digital assets remain safeguarded in Copper’s custody.  Copper’s ClearLoop network connects multiple exchanges in one secure trading loop, with real-time settlement across numerous networks.  The collapse of crypto exchange FTX has led to a greater focus on using regulated custodians and the custody revenue opportunity could grow to $8 billion by 2033, brokerage firm Bernstein said in a research report Tuesday.  “Institutional crypto investors are, above all, seeking out ways to better safeguard their assets and optimize their trading,” said Victor Wei, vice-president of institutional clients at BitMart, adding that “ClearLoop meets these demands and in so doing is contributing to the maturing of the ecosystem.”  London-based Copper inked a $500 million insurance deal with U.K. insurance giant Aon (AON) in November, arranging cover for half a billion dollars' worth of digital assets kept in cold storage, in one of the biggest such deals in the industry.

7762095,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516663,1674126032,59% of Bitcoin Holders Are Sitting On Profits,"59% of Bitcoin holders are profitable as the coin trades above the current Realized Price, which is the cost basis of the average BTC holder, IntoTheblock data on January 19, shows. Parallel on-chain streams show that the realized price of Bitcoin is around $19,700. Comparing this number with the spot BTC price presently at over $20,700, it means 59% of coin holders are sitting on profits, a net positive for the ecosystem. This development is a shot in the arm for HODLers, considering the sharp contraction of prices over the past few months. Then BTC plunged from around $69,000 in November 2021 to slightly over $15,000 in 2022. On-chain data are crunched in real-time, and analysts interpret them to gauge the state of the market. Their interpretation, in turn, could massively influence sentiment and determine how retail traders act based on price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Investors Predict 12% Decline For BTC In Next Two Weeks As BTC prices react from $21,600 posted earlier this week, on-chain statistics show more than half of BTC holders are in green. Only 38% of market participants are out of the money. Most Bitcoin Holders Have Been In The Red Even as BTC appears to recover, there must be a comprehensive breakout to solidify and revive demand. Based on the recent Bitcoin price action, most holders appear to be in the green after an extended period of losses. Trackers show that holders have been in losing territory since mid-August 2022. The situation only worsened in subsequent months when fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) swept across the crypto and BTC markets, forcing the coin even lower. This draw-down was because of the unexpected collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, and Alameda Research, a trading firm closely associated with the Sam Bankman-Fried exchange. By early November, BTC had dropped by over 65% from 2021 peaks, highlighting the level of apprehension across the board, pushing the Realized Price even lower. Realized Versus Market Price Realized Price is a metric that measures the price of all BTC currently in supply at the rate they were bought. The value obtained is then divided by the BTC in the circulating supply. The result gives an “average cost basis” which is then used to describe the Realized Price. It is different from the spot market price because the latter indicates Bitcoin’s current price based on real-time supply and demand. Like any other asset, BTC prices are massively determined by market forces, with the “hype” element, describing sentiment, another factor to consider. Related Reading: Overbought Or Ready To Rip? Bitcoin Daily RSI Reaches Explosive Levels That more than half of Bitcoin holders are profitable at spot rates is important. Realized Price helps judge the overall economic state of the Bitcoin market. How this metric fluctuates versus the market price tells whether BTC holders are buoyant or distressed. In technical analysis, the Realized Price can be used to mark resistance or support levels. Technically, whenever the Realized Price exceeds the Market Price, it indicates some BTC holders are in profit. If it drops below Market Price, then on aggregate, a section of market participants is in red. Profitability depends on the price level they bought.

Developers plan to bridge JOE tokens once the DEX is live on Arbitrum and BNB Chain, two other blockchain networks. JOE will be the governance token on those networks, with one JOE equal to one vote on Trader Joe’s governance forums, where holders can propose and decide on strategies or improvements for the platform’s future.  In addition, Trader Joe plans to provide stakers with a share of trading fees accrued on the DEX through staked joe (sJOE), a token given to users who supply JOE to the DEX in return for rewards.  Such fee rewards are currently only available on version 1 of the Trader Joe platform, but as part of the version 2 launch expected in February, sJOE stakers will be able to receive a share of trading fees for all chains, including Avalanche, Arbitrum and Binance. sJOE deposit fee will remain at 1%.  Trader Joe is one of the largest DEX and lending services on Avalanche, locking up over $88 million worth of tokens as of Friday. The platform previously announced its move to Arbitrum – its first-ever deployment on a separate network – in December, as CoinDesk reported.  The DEX captured $2.5 billion in locked value at its lifetime peak in 2021 and continues to attract the highest transactional volumes among all Avalanche-based products, DeFiLlama data shows.  Trader Joe’s Liquidity Book – a product that claims to make DEX trading more efficient by reducing slippage and improving capital efficiency – will be rolled out in the launch.  As part of the Liquidity Book Rewards program expected in February, holders of vote-escrowed JOE (veJOE) holders will be able to receive “boosted” JOE rewards. These rewards will continue to be offered only on Avalanche, however.  These veJOE tokens were part of a rewards program that allowed users to lock their tokens on Trader Joe for a longer length of time in return for greater yield. Doing so allowed Trader Joe to improve its liquidity while continuing to incentivize users.  Meanwhile, the Rocket Joe program, which aimed to provide liquidity to new products launching on Avalanche, will be deprecated.  “Since mid-2022 Rocket Joe has not blasted off and this raises the question around the use-case for rJOE staking,” developers said. “With the 2023 direction of the Decentralized Exchange, the decision has been made to deprecate rJOE staking, this decision is live now and rJOE staking is now no longer accepting new deposits of JOE.”  All stakers of rJOE will receive a commemorative non-fungible token (NFT) as a reward for their participation.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ARB | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/19/avalanche-dex-trader-joe-plans-to-make-its-tokens-more-valuable-for-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3de11dcacf62366b46749abdab13b9f78082de28-1500x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414625,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCfyO,1674123941,Bitcoin Bridged to Avalanche Surpasses BTC Locked in Lightning Network,"The number of bitcoin (BTC) bridged or ported from the Bitcoin blockchain to the Avalanche smart contract blockchain has surpassed the tally of coins held in the Lightning Network, a second-layer solution for Bitcoin's scalability problems.  On Tuesday, the total circulating supply of bridged BTC, or BTC.b, on Avalanche rose to a record 5,700 BTC ($118.6 million), according to data sourced from Dune Analytics. Meanwhile, the number of bitcoin locked in the Lightening Network stood at 4,929 BTC ($100 million).  The flippening has brought cheer to the Avalanche community and developers behind the project.  ""Yesterday marked a pretty awesome milestone for the asset as it exceeded 5,700 in total circulating supply on Avalanche and, in only a handful of months, surpassed the current capacity of the Lightning network,"" Morgan Krupetsky, director of BD for institutions and capital markets at Avalanche's creator Ava Labs wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.  Avalanche added support for BTC in its cross-chain bridge in June 2022, opening the doors for bitcoin holders to transfer coins to Avalanche and access the Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.  To initiate BTC to Avalanche, a user sends a user sends a transaction on Bitcoin from the new Core Wallet that transfers BTC to the bridge address controlled by the SGX enclave, a trusted execution environment embedded in a process. The SGX enclave then creates or mints an equivalent amount of BTC.b to the user wallet that sent the initiating Bitcoin transaction.  When moving BTC.B back to the Bitcoin Blockchain, the user sends a transaction on Avalanche, calling the ""unwrap"" method, which burns the BTC.b tokens.  Per Krupetsky, BTC.b is a better option than Wrapped Bitcoin for institutions or anyone looking to earn yield through DeFi on their BTC holdings.  ""A lot of institutions I speak with have at least part of their holdings allocated to BTC–either as a reserve asset, for portfolio diversification, or other reasons. Whether you’re looking to simply send/receive BTC quickly and cost effectively, earn yield passively on your BTC holdings, or borrow against them, BTC.b on Avalanche is your easy answer to doing so,"" Krupetsky said.  ""Unlike wrapped Bitcoin, BTC.b allows users to seamlessly bridge between bitcoin and Avalanche whenever they want for a relatively minuscule cost,"" Krupetsky added.  To the uninitiated, wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) is the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on Ethereum, the world's largest smart contract blockchain. WBTC is an Ethereum ERC-20 token that represents bitcoin and can be swapped on a 1:1 basis for BTC.  A bitcoin holder wanting to access the Ethereum-based DeFi first needs to mint the wrapped bitcoin token called WBTC. The process is handled by merchants such as Loopring, DeversiFi, and the custodian BitGo.  Once a BTC holder submits a request for WBTC, merchants perform verification procedures to confirm users’ identity and initiate the minting process by authorizing BitGo to mint WBTC. The merchant then transfers the user's BTC to BitGo in exchange for the newly minted wBTC, which the user can deploy in DeFi to generate additional yield. The user's underlying bitcoin is held in BitGo Trust in segregated cold storage accounts.  The redemption process involves users again paying a fee to the merchant, which then initiates the transaction to burn WBTC and release BTC from BitGo's custody.  Here the user cannot unwrap BTC on its own and hence stands exposed to potential disruptions in constant stream of redemptions, which may prove costly during bouts of market volatility.  ""The issue with this (WBTC] process is that in times of volatile markets, redemptions typically do not occur on-demand causing de-pegging since a user cannot simply unwrap the BTC themselves,"" Ava Labs' head of DeFi Luigi D'Onorio DeMeo, tweeted.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/19/bitcoin-bridged-to-avalanche-surpasses-btc-locked-in-lightning-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21a093d83f3953d36aac2805a6e0501d88b85cc7-2000x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The upgrade, which is scheduled to take place at block height 7937500 on Jan. 23, 16:00 UTC, will include a number of important enabling upgrades for Osmosis.  One of the key features of the upgrade is the implementation of geometric TWAP (Time Weighted Average Pricing) in Osmosis liquidity pools. In finance, a TWAP is the average price of an asset over a specified time. A TWAP strategy is often used to minimize a large order’s impact on the market by dispersing the large order into smaller quantities and executing them at regular intervals over time, as per Binance.  The above will allow protocols building on Osmosis to choose between two pricing mechanisms that will be relevant for the protocol to provide “concentrated liquidity” to users – a design that increases the capital efficiency of using a DEX along with improved rewards for liquidity pools (LP).  Liquidity pools refer to tokens supplied by a user to a DEX, which in turn incentivizes users to become liquidity providers in exchange for a share of transaction fees and free tokens.  The upgrade would also make pricing ticks more efficient and will stave off liquidity attacks utilizing upward price manipulation. Such manipulation has previously resulted in bad actors making off with as much as $100 million by manipulating DEXs.  Read more: How Market Manipulation Led to a $100M Exploit on Solana DeFi Exchange Mango  Furthermore, Neon will introduce a downtime detection module, which will detect if the Osmosis network is out of action or unavailable for use and prevent improper liquidations on other lending protocols that rely on Osmosis’ pricing data.  Osmosis developers said that it was important to get this upgrade deployed quickly in order to pave the way for the upcoming integration of the Mars Protocol, a credit lending and borrowing marketplace.  Users will be unable to use the Osmosis DEX and staking and governance features will also be unavailable until the upgrade is complete.

42414630,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCgeq,1674115205,OKX Publishes Proof-of-Reserves Report Showing $7.5B in ‘Clean Assets’,"OKX has $7.5 billion in reserves, and these reserves do not contain its native token, according to a report published by the exchange on Thursday.  This is the third proof of reserves OKX has published, but the first to show the exact breakdown of assets.  The report shows the exchange is overcollateralized with a reserve ratio of 105% for bitcoin (BTC), 105% for ether (ETH), and 101% for USDT.  OKX publishing the exact asset mix comes as a response to an CryptoQuant developing a metric to measure the “cleanliness” of reserves. CryptoQuant defines this as how reliant an exchange is on its native token. CryptoQuant’s data shows that OKX’s reserves are 100% clean. Binance, meanwhile, is 87% clean, Bitfinex is 70% clean and Huobi is 60% clean.  “I personally think everyone will learn a ton over the next six months to a year. We will all stress test each other’s proof of reserves, hopefully in a constructive way,” Haider Rafique, OKX’s chief marketing officer, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We are all going to learn from each other and ask the hard questions – hopefully most venues have good intentions.”  Rafique says that OKX plans to publish its proof-of-reserves report every month. The exchange also plans to launch a bug bounty program allowing developers to “poke” at the report to see if there are any bugs in the system or anything else that OKX needs to address.  A different kind of native token  The so-called cleanliness of reserves is important due to the relationship between the now-bankrupt FTX and its sister company Alameda Research. As CoinDesk reported in November, a material portion of Alameda’s balance sheet was made up of FTT – a synthetic creation of FTX. From this, numerous questions emerged about what was backing Alameda’s ability to trade and invest.  Further, in late December, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a complaint against former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison that FTT, and by virtue of the fact other exchange tokens, are investment contracts and thus a security. Ellison isn’t contesting the SEC’s claims as part of her overall guilty plea and is cooperating with prosecutors.  In this complaint, the SEC highlighted that FTX planned to use the funds from the FTT sales to create, promote and manage the FTX business, with the aim of making FTT an ""investment"" with potential for profit.  “We’ve never used a native token to finance the company,” Rafique said to CoinDesk. “The native token was never a big part of our business or treasury. Our native token was always designed to engage our most active customers and give them a way to seek discounts through activity on the platform.”  Separation between coin and exchange  While other exchanges have launched their own stablecoins – and with this has come its own set of problems – Rafique says that’s not on the agenda for OKX.  “We don't believe any trading venue, centralized or decentralized, has any business, launching their own asset that gets traded, even a stable asset that people settle in,” Rafique said. “There are many conflicts of interest that exist. It goes back to our philosophy around native tokens. We aren’t building our company around a native token offering.”  Investing with fiat  OKX does operate a venture fund called OKX Ventures but, as Rafique explained, this firm has a separate balance sheet and an executive team that manages it.  And when OKX Ventures invests, it uses fiat currency.  “It’s a very traditional fund with a very traditional format,” Rafique said.",POSITIVE,FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | FTT | TOKEN SALE,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/19/okx-publishes-proof-of-reserves-report-showing-75b-in-clean-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eef8c61395217841d4b3e99c4fb3b32b7db2eeee-2550x1302.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414624,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBCg3h,1674115100,"Ether, Bitcoin Long Traders See $110M Liquidations on Bitzlato-Induced Volatility","A notice on the U.S. Justice Department’s website about an oncoming crypto-related effort resulted in a steep sell-off on Wednesday, causing bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) to dip under newly breached support levels before slightly recovering.  The U.S. Justice Department announced a major international cryptocurrency enforcement action at noon ET on Wednesday. That turned out to be a money laundering charge against Bitzlato, a little-known crypto exchange that is said to have illegally conducted $700 million in direct and indirect transfers in the last several years.  The time between the initial announcement and the actual news ended up being a hotbed for doomsayers.  Such sentiment was enough to trigger the steep fall. Bitcoin quickly tumbled some $1,000 to under $20,600 after touching a four-month high of about $21,550. Ether fell to $1,500 from over $1,600, with major tokens including XRP and cardano (ADA) following the brisk sliding.  Coinglass data shows over $110 million worth of futures positions betting on the rise of bitcoin and ether were liquidated in the past 24 hours, representing over 76% of all futures trades. Dogecoin (DOGE) futures also racked up $9 million in liquidations, while solana (SOL) and aptos (APT) futures took on $8 million in losses apiece.  Out of $224 million in overall liquidations, crypto exchange OKX saw the majority of losses at $109 million, followed by Binance at $90 million.  Some analysts, however, were expecting an imminent pullback regardless of news-driven trading.  “The entire recent rally has been built on the backbone of continuous market shorts keeping funding low and prices being pushed up by forced liquidations and running stops,” markets analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex analysts said in a note earlier this week.  “A pullback might be expected with a cautious approach from bulls,” they said, pointing to the “limited traders in the market, which is evident from the market depth remaining the same week on week.”  Bitcoin and ether remained steady in Asian trading hours on Thursday.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/19/ether-bitcoin-long-traders-see-110m-liquidations-on-bitzlato-induced-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e62f5a1165f230b7cf3ff8965fe164b29a2bd5d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, was named as one of the receiving and sending counterparties associated with Bitzlato, according to the order from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  ""Approximately two-thirds of Bitzlato’s top receiving and sending counterparties are associated with darknet markets or scams. For example, Bitzlato’s top three receiving counterparties, by total amount of BTC received between May 2018 and September 2022, were: (1) Binance, a VASP [virtual asset service provider]; (2) the Russia-connected darknet market Hydra; and (3) the alleged Russia-based Ponzi scheme “TheFiniko,” the order said.  During the same period, the top three sending counterparties were Hydra, Local Bitcoins and TheFiniko, the order added.  ""Binance is pleased to have provided substantial assistance to international law enforcement partners in support of this investigation. This exemplifies Binance’s commitment to working collaboratively with law enforcement partners worldwide,"" a Binance spokesperson said.  Local Bitcoin and TheFiniko did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  FinCEN formally labeled Bitzlato a “primary money-laundering concern,” that usually cuts off a business from the global financial system.  The order seeks to prohibit the transmittal of funds involving Bitzlato by any domestic financial institution or all covered financial institutions as it has had a key role in handling illicit transactions for ransomware actors in Russia.  ""In addition to receiving ransomware proceeds, Bitzlato’s receiving and sending transactional activity shows a significant connection to counterparties associated with other suspected illicit activities, such as darknet markets and scams with ties to and operations in Russia.""  The order, effective, Feb. 1, 2023, ""to ensure orderly implementation"" is ""the only means of adequately addressing the threat Bitzlato poses.""

The purpose of AUDN would be to allow its customers to settle transactions on blockchain technology in real time using Australian dollars, NAB said. AUDN could also be used for several other purposes including ""carbon credit trading, overseas money transfers and repurchase agreements,"" NAB’s Chief Innovation officer Howard Silby told AFR.  The stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum and Algorand blockchains, the latter a smart contract platform similar to Ethereum.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset class, such as a fiat currency or gold, to stabilize its price. It is considered to be more efficient and cheaper than the interbank cross-border payments solution SWIFT. In this case, the AUDN will be backed fully to the Australian dollar and the money will be held by the NAB.  NAB is the second major Australian bank to be involved in the creation of a stablecoin. Earlier, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) teamed up with crypto custodian Fireblocks to mint a stablecoin pegged to the Australian dollar.  Australia has introduced token mapping to identify characteristics of all crypto tokens and how they are managed, and its central bank has started a pilot test to explore potential use cases for Australia's own CBDC, expected to be completed by mid-2023.  In an effort to tighten safety around crypto, the Australian government promised last month to establish a framework for the licensing and regulation of crypto service providers in 2023.

The funds will help the firm, which was formerly known as FQX, scale its debt platform that is set to go live next month on the Polygon blockchain.  Blockchange Ventures and Circle Ventures participated in the extension, joining initial seed investors Earlybird and SIX Fintech Ventures. Combined with its initial fundraise in late 2021, Obligate’s seed round now totals more than $8.5 million.  Switzerland-based Obligate essentially allows companies to issue on-chain bonds and commercial paper – or debt securities that define the terms of a loan – to receive funding from investors in a regulated decentralized finance (DeFi) environment. Alternate routes of fundraising could become more popular as venture capital firms and traditional finance (TradFi) investors take a more cautious approach after the collapse of multibillion-dollar centralized crypto exchange FTX.  ""Obligate combines the benefits of DeFi with the trust and regulation of TradFi,” Obligate co-founder and CEO Benedikt Schuppli told CoinDesk in an email. “Obligate is more efficient than many other bond platforms as we allow a direct issuance of blockchain-based bonds from the issuer to the wallet of the investors.”  Issuers have to go through Know Your Customer (KYC) verifications before creating a bond program suited to their liquidity needs, which can be done with a few clicks. The liquidity will be denominated in stablecoins such as USDC but can be quickly converted into U.S. dollars, explained Schuppli.  Investors will be able to access Obligate through their existing crypto wallet.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether spend their Wednesday in the red.  Insights: Embattledcrypto exchange FTX and several venture capital firms hold a ton of illiquid tokens such as Serum (SRM).  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,004.63 −4.3 ▼ 0.4% Bitcoin (BTC) $20,868 −64.2 ▼ 0.3% Ethereum (ETH) $1,554 +5.7 ▲ 0.4% S&P 500 daily close  3,999.09 +15.9 ▲ 0.4% Gold  $1,920 +1.9 ▲ 0.1% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.51% ▲ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  The Market Goes to the Doges  By Sam Reynolds  Bitcoin and ether are beginning the business day in Asia well into the red.  The world’s largest digital asset by market value is down 2% on the day, while ether is down 3.2%.  Layer 1 blockchain Solana, which began the year with a sharp rally thanks to the success of Shiba Inu-themed Bonk, is down nearly 8.5% on the day.  There’s been some debate as to the driver of the rally. While the market is in a meme coin mood, there is a deeper debate about the brewing storm in Washington, D.C., and what it means for risk assets like crypto.  ""In our view, crypto (and bitcoin in particular) has been somewhat misunderstood. It is not an inflation hedge, but more of a debasement hedge that protects holders from fiscal/monetary profligacy and policy error,” Jonah Van Bourg, global head of trading at Cumberland, told CoinDesk in a note. “Any risk of U.S. debt default is indeed a form of U.S. dollar debasement and/or policy error, and the increased demand we're seeing (expressed in higher crypto prices) is this use case bearing itself out.”  Giles Coghlan, chief market analyst at HYCM, told CoinDesk that the correlation between crypto and tech stocks continues, and that’s the factor to watch going forward.  “Tech stocks have rallied on the assumption that U.S. inflation is retreating and that short-term interest rate market predictions of two Federal Reserve rate cuts this year are correct. We can see a similar recovery in the crypto markets,” he told CoinDesk, dismissing any connection between the debt ceiling debate and the crypto rally. “Ultimately, the crypto rally should continue as long as tech stocks stage their recovery. However, as all eyes turn to earnings season, things could change quickly.”  Still, blockchain analytics firm Santiment wrote in a note that rallies of DOGE and other dog-themed meme coins are a contrarian indicator of the market’s health. When these prices skyrocket it means the market has gotten too hot and hedonistic.  ""Every time that [the] price of DOGE starts rising rapidly, there's a market-wide crash following just moments later,"" the firm wrote.

By Sam Reynolds  A court filing has revealed some of FTX’s largest liquid holdings, which are largely to be expected: solana, bitcoin, ether, aptos and dogecoin. These are widely held tokens that, for the most part, would be found on the balance sheet of any major exchange.  But what about the illiquid holdings? These aren’t exactly household names, but were tokens in the Sam Bankman-Fried-Alameda universe that failed to launch. A good portion of them can be found on the balance sheet of funds including Sino Global and Multicoin Capital. FTX invested in these funds, and their names often appear alongside FTX as co-investors.  Take, for instance, Serum. In April 2021, when Bankman-Fried and FTX were peaking, people couldn’t get enough of the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX), and the SRM token touched a record high of $13.74 during the bull market that extended into late 2021.  Now, the SRM token lacks liquidity as Binance delisted some of its most liquid trading pairs (it still allows BUSD-SRM trading) and the +2% depth on the remaining exchanges tops at just over $100,000. Because of this, any sizable position of SRM being unloaded couldn’t be absorbed by the market.  There’s also Oxygen, FIDA and JET, all of which are other pieces of the Solana trading infrastructure equation.  And all three have the same problem: no liquidity. Oxygen has less than $200,000 of trading volume and +2% bid depths of less than $1000. JET has depth in the hundreds of dollars and no listings on any major DEX or centralized exchange.  As CoinDesk reported previously, some of these tokens are locked up at FTX. Maps.me and Oxygen have over 90% of their supply locked up at FTX.  There is one other place you can find these tokens: on the balance sheets of venture capital firms in which FTX has invested.  FTX has close ties with Sino Global Capital, which is noted on the venture investments slide of the filing. On Sino’s balance are many of these same tokens.  FTX-invested Multicoin capital also counts SRM and OXY on its balance sheet.  The only good news is that their exposure is probably small. FTX, by some calculations, owns nearly 99% of OXY and SRM.  (So much for decentralization.)  Multicoin, as CoinDesk had previously reported, is stuck with the double whammy of not just having illiquid Sam coins like OXY and SRM on its balance sheet but also having 10% of its assets stuck on FTX.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is already looking into the due diligence process – or lack thereof – FTX investors engaged in.  No doubt some of these tokens will also come up in the investigation, and later we’ll learn more about why otherwise shrewd VC firms aped into tokens whose selling point was largely Sam Bankman-Fried.  Let’s hope that these VCs take this as a lesson, so they don’t get stuck with another illiquid bag of tokens when the next bull market cycle cracks.

The upgrade was due to several developments on-chain. According to its January 1st blog post, it was because the system of LUNC remints tokens that were burnt for a development fund. Along with this, the ecosystem would also have an increase in gas fees for better validators and staking rewards in the platform. This would mean that the ecosystem would continuously burn and make LUNC a deflationary currency. Related Reading: XRP Bulls Aim For $1 As Crypto Advances With 12% Weekly Pump What It Means For LUNC Luna Classic becoming deflationary would have an effect on the token. But this wouldn’t be enough for the token to have a big move in the short and mid-term. Based on the blog post, this burn rate of the ecosystem would increase as remints would be eliminated. The proposal also increases the gas fees in the ecosystem, making the usage of the community fund more efficient. Although this may seem bad, Terra Luna Classic’s gas fees are still comparably low compared to Terra 2.0. Image: CryptoSlate The proposal was well received by the community. This could be a catalyst for a consistent move upwards as LUNC rides the altcoin rally. LUNC is the native cryptocurrency of the old Terra network. It was launched in 2018 under the name LUNA, but was renamed LUNC following the Terra disaster. Long Term, The Key For Gains Short term, the token is set to break its current upward trend. Volatility is expected to enter the market in the next few days – but then that is not surprising – as the market prices in the burnt tokens. It is likely, however, that the token would have a respite in the coming days as deflationary forces act upon the token. As the time of writing, the token’s price is at $0.00017586, a percent discount from yesterday’s price movement, but LUNC also exhibited sizable gains in the weekly and bi-weekly time frame. The token is also currently facing strong resistance at $0.00018073. LUNC total market cap at $993 million on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Hedera Soars 23% As HBAR Blooms All-Green On The Charts All Week In the short-mid term, the token would revert back to its support at $0.00015726 in the next couple of days or weeks. If the token experiences a pull back in price, the token should have enough momentum to retest the $0.00018073 resistance level. If the token breaches the $0.00018073 resistance level, it could regain and consolidate above it in the coming weeks to retest $0.0001866 with confidence. Investors and trader should brace themselves for a bumpy few days as the token experiences volatility. Long-term, holding LUNC is the best move for investors and traders as the market rides on Bitcoin’s resistance break at $21,000.
