42376463,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ai35,1369002551,Liberty-focused non-profits find a friend in Bitcoin #Bitcoin2013,"Representatives from three non-profit organizations that accept donations in bitcoins say their groups' freedom- and peace-focused missions mesh with the Bitcoin ethos.  The speakers shared their experience with the cryptocurrency during a panel discussion on Sunday at Bitcoin 2013 in San Jose.  ""For Fr33 Aid, we started acepting bitcoins in 2011, we posted our address online, but we didn't get our first donation until early 2012,"" said Teresa Warmke, treasurer of Fr33 Aid, a New Hampshire-based organization that works to ""help individuals organize projects that educate people about the value of mutual aid.""  ""When we started actually taking it, we called it around the staff, 'the Bitcoin experiment,'"" recalled Angela Keaton, director of operations at Antiwar.com. She said her organization converts bitcoin into dollars every few days, although she can sometimes spend bitcoins directly for expenses such as paying consultants.  Carla Gericke said her organization -- the libertarian Free State Project, based in New Hampshire -- also converts most of its bitcoins into US dollars.  Fr33 Aid, on the other hand, is completely bitcoin-based, and strives to keep fewer than 10 US dollars in its bank account, Warmke said. The organization supports volunteers, and many of the volunteers are happy to receive reimbursements or subsidies in bitcoins, she said. Warmke noted that she's gotten some of the bitcoins the nonprofit uses through LocalBitcoins.com, which helps people find local traders for bitcoin transactions.  Warmke added that Bitcoin helps her organization be financially transparent, because anyone can look up the group's transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain.  Accepting bitcoins has helped some of the organizations win support among their target communities, panelists said. Fr33 Aid, for example, noticed a big bump in donations when the group announced it was giving up filing with the IRS and going over to an all-bitcoin system, Warmke said.  ""I think what she's really saying is yes, we're willing to accept all the Bitcoin millionaires' donations,"" Gericke said, laughing.  Sometimes dealing with the ""legacy banking system"" creates problems that organizations have found they can avoid by using bitcoins instead, panelists said.  Warmke described how Fr33 Aid's PayPal account was locked down twice ... once after the group accepted its first-ever donation of more than $1,000. She ended up paying some expenses out of her own pocket while waiting for the organization's funds to be unlocked.  Panelists acknowledged there are downsides to accepting bitcoins. One disadvantage is the currency's volatility.  ""You by default become a currency speculator,"" Gericke said.  Charities that don't understand that aspect could end up losing a lot of money on a Bitcoin value drop.  The Bitcoin community is ripe to develop its own charitable organizations, panelists said. That could help new businesses set up corporate giving plans as they start to become profitable.  ""We're definitely working with Bitcoin not Bombs already to publicize people who have sponsored our work,"" Warmke said.  Moderator Stephanie Murphy, director of operations for Fr33 Aid, suggested that donors could create a mining pool for charities, or think of other creative ways to support charities with bitcoins.  One thing that is different about accepting bitcoin donations is that nonprofits don't always know who sent them money. Warmke said she would like a way to give donors the opportunity to leave their email address so she could send a thank-you. For now, she just asks bitcoin donors to contact the group when they give.  (The Seasteading Institute, which exhibited at Bitcoin 2013, also accepts bitcoin donations, although the organization did not participate in the panel.)  One final note: Throughout Bitcoin 2013, the non-profit panel was the only discussion CoinDesk attended where all the panelists and the moderator were women. With the addition of a few women sitting in the audience, this session might well have seen the most women gathered in one room for the whole weekend.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | SPONSORED,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/19/liberty-focused-non-profits-find-a-friend-in-bitcoin-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e07ac049b0846922792d42ae231e85038423fc9-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376481,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiND,1368999515,Bitcoin Fund aims to make bitcoin investing easy #Bitcoin2013,"What's the Bitcoin Fund? It's an investment fund in which every share costs one bitcoin ... and Anatoliy Knyazev, managing partner at the Bitcoin Fund, and Tim Enneking, chairman of Altima Asset Management were on hand at Bitcoin 2013 on Sunday to walk attendees through how it all works.  Investing in Bitcoin Fund has many advantages, Knyazev asserted. First, he said, it's easier to buy shares on the exchange than it is to buy bitcoins. Second, he added, the fund holds bitcoins in a highly secure manner, with sound cryptography and three storage locations on three separate continents ... which takes the responsibility for security off of investors' hands.  The fund has another advantage for companies or other legal entities that would like to invest in bitcoins, Enneking added.  If you put bitcoins in your balance sheet, he said, it's hard to explain to auditors, regulatory agencies and investors. Instead, by putting their money into shares in a fund, investors in the Bitcoin Fund are able to make their bitcoin investment looks like any other investment.  The Bitcoin Fund also offers the advantage of a staff that will watch the market 24/7, Enneking said. Investors who want can request a call if, say, an emergency develops ... such as a major exchange unexpectedly shutting down.  ""If you buy bitcoin yourself -- unless you're addicted to Jolt Cola and can stay in front of your computer 24 hours a day, seven days a week -- you're going to miss something,"" Enneking said.  For investors buying or selling large amounts of bitcoins, working through a fund has another advantage, Enneking said. The fund helps ensure that such investors can move in or out of the market without disrupting the market. For example, the fund can buy or sell bitcoins gradually, at a target price set by the customer.  Launched by the Malta-based EXANTE brokerage firm, the Bitcoin Fund will not take management fees from gains -- that would mess up the plan to have each share always be worth one bitcoin. However, it does charge investors a 0.5 percent transaction fee.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/19/bitcoin-fund-aims-to-make-bitcoin-investing-easy-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b9ffb835b8e5137a41ee4bf558385130ed57bc6-628x356.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376477,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiJR,1368983910,Economists wrestle with Bitcoin's 'narrative problem' #Bitcoin2013,"Amazon's new ""Coins"" are gimmicky, said panelists in a session on the economics of Bitcoin at the Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose on Saturday. And companies issue their own currency simply as a ploy to hold onto customers' unspent value, they said.  Panelists also discussed such issues as taxation and academia's low interest in Bitcoin.  Governments will pay more attention to Bitcoin as time goes on, predicted Yoni Assia, CEO of the social investment network eToro.  ""Governments won't give up taxation so easily,"" Assia said. He expects that citizens will have to report purchases and sale of bitcoins. He added that we'll eventually see Facebook apps that show bitcoin transactions, which will make usage of the digital currency transparent for regulators.  In addition to Assia, panelists included Tuur Demeester, who writes the financial newsletter MacroTrends; Peter Surda, a software developer who runs the blog Economics of Bitcoin; and Garrick Hileman, an academic who researches parallel and alternative currencies and is finishing his PhD at the London School of Economics.  Following are some highlights of Saturday's panel discussion:  Q. Moderator: Is Bitcoin a currency or commodity?  A. Demeester: Both.  Surda: I would say it is a liquid commodity and ... I would avoid the word currency.  Q. Moderator: Why has Bitcoin not been more interesting to the academic world?  A. Hileman: They're starting to get more attention. (A few more Bitcoin-focused publications are coming out, Hileman noted.) A lot of academics are very skeptical of Bitcoin. I don't know if that's based on the blinders that economists often have to things that are outside their worldview ... The Bitcoin narrative is so important to whether Bitcoin's going to take off or not. There's a narrative problem right now in the public eye with Bitcoin and that's one of the big challenges.  Q. Audience member: It only takes one guy to ruin a great party. We have a great thing going with Bitcoin and I think the potential is limitless but there is a tremendous risk (of a ) nation-state attack. If you had an authoritarian nation-state with a lot of technological capacity (like China) who says, ""We don't like this,"" and launch a 51 percent attack, how would that be resolved?  A. Assia: I think it's a domino effect. The Bitcoin community is a huge community of financial hackers. They will identify very fast, an attack like this. Even if a small country comes in and starts doing mining on an institutional government level, other countries are going to say, ""We''re not going to let Israel or Ireland dominate the mining ... (The same thing could happen with corporations, Assia added.) Once somebody starts that, it'll just make mining and the hashing much more difficult ... If that starts, Bitcoin will fly to the thousands (in value) very fast. It will just legitimize it.  Demeester: If this is what war is like in the future, I would sign up for that immediately.  Hileman: The real question is why this hasn't happened already.  Surda: Let's say that this happens and it fails ... That would be a huge boost ... The attacker needs to be sure that they can win, and if you have more money (it) does not ensure that you will win.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/19/economists-wrestle-with-bitcoins-narrative-problem-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376476,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiGv,1368925793,"BitPay, Foodler, Paymium execs talk bitcoin challenges #Bitcoin2013","How have early-adopting bitcoin merchants overcome stumbling blocks in doing business with a digital currency? A panel of entrepreneurs shared their experiences during a discussion today at Bitcoin 2013.  A panel of both Bitcoin business operators and other merchants convened at Bitcoin 2013 to discuss how to get over the stumbling blocks in the road of becoming early adopters of the digital currency.  Moderated by Mark Edge, a host with the libertarian call-in radio show ""Free Talk Live,"" the panel included Pierre Noizat, co-founder and chief operations officer of Paymium; David Johnston, CEO of Engine Inc.; Stephen Pair, co-founder and CTO of BitPay; and Christian Dumontet, co-founder and CEO of online food ordering service Foodler.  Following are some of the questions and answers from the panel:  Q. Edge: How do you bring together merchants, who tend to be conservative, and early-adopter bitcoin users?  A. Pair (BitPay): If a merchant wants to be totally isolated from bitcoin, they can be. They can set their prices in dollars and get paid in dollars. BitPay becomes just the payment network, and of course it's a great payment network (because of the lack of chargebacks).  Q. Edge: Do you hope that people pay with bitcoins?  A. Dumontet (Foodler): ""Yes, the fees are lower, you don't have the chargeback issue.  Q. Edge: Pierre, how are you targeting larger businesses?  A. Noizat (Paymium): The first challenge we have today is to have a working marketplace in Europe, to isolate the merchants from the volatility risk. They need to (be able to) cash out in euros instantly if they want to. That takes a mechanism that to my mind doesn't exist yet. (Note: Noizat's company had a partnership with a financial institution, but it ended in part because the institution was scared by bitcoin's volatility, according to Noizat. The company is now looking for a new banking partner.)  Q. Edge: David, do you find your customers are (reluctant) to try paying in bitcoin?  A. Johnston (Engine Inc.): Most of the people paying us in bitcoin are already in the bitcoin community ... Merchants, I advise that if you are interested in accepting bitcoin, go tap into the bitcoin community (on reddit or bitcoin forums). People in the bitcoin community want the value of their bitcoins to increase. I would recommend that you get involved in the online communities, make announcements there that you now accept it.  Q. Edge: Stephen, since BitPay sees the purchases that go through, so can you tell us which businesses are doing the most transactions with it, and why?  A. Pair (BitPay): We don't necessarily know who the buyer is. A merchant can set up the account with us so BitPay does not see any buyer information. A lot of merchants do share some buyer information with us because we can help them process refunds, etc. There are merchants that process 50, 100 transactions a day, and others that do one.  There's a lot of marketing value to announcing that you're accepting bitcoin, a lot of them do it for that purpose. Many of them do it because they are supportive of bitcoin and this is a good way for them to accumulate bitcoins. For some of them, bitcoins represent a tiny percentage of their overall sales, so they'll take the whole purchase in bitcoins (instead of converting it to dollars).  Dumontet (Foodler): The largest group of bitcoin customers is here in SF.  Q. Audience member: How can I get vendors in China to accept bitcoins? When I discuss it with them, it sounds like a scam to them.  A. Pair (BitPay): We implemented a billing feature so that merchants can keep a lot of their receivables in bitcoins.  Johnston (Engine Inc.): I thought it was really interesting just a few weeks ago that CCTV (China Central Television) aired that 30-minute documentary on bitcoins ... It's sort of an implied, ""This is OK."" That may be a great educational tool ... They can take the currency risk out if they want (by instantly converting to their local currency).  Edge (moderator): I think it just comes down to options and variables and growth.  Q. Audience member: I'm looking to build a company (in the US) that's 100-percent bitcoin.  A. Edge (moderator): You're going to have some challenges paying workers in bitcoins.  (Johnston of Engine Inc. says he thinks it would be possible to overcome the challenges. He suggests the questioner hire a consulting firm that will help him with compliance.)  Q. Audience member: It takes time for the bitcoin network to reconcile every transaction. So if you want to accept bitcoins, how long should you wait before and handing over the goods?  A. Pair (BitPay): If it's a bar of gold, wait for six confirmations.  Johnston (Engine Inc.): It's typically an hour to get a full confirmation, but I'm interested in the services popping up that say we can make this instant (using trusted merchants).  Dumontet (Foodler): The amount of computational power needed to falsify a three-confirmation transaction would make it very difficult.  Q. Edge: Do any of you have a recorded case of someone running a fraudulent transaction with BitPay?  A. Pair (BitPay): We had one transaction that didn't confirm, but it was an accident. It's not impossible ... it's been done before. People have (gamed) SatoshiDice (through double-spend fraud).  There's a very good paper that Meni Rosenfeld wrote that analyzes the risk ... It's a risk assessment... depending on the nature of the transaction, how long should you wait to be comfortable. Going out six confirmations is pretty iron-clad. After one transaction, you're pretty safe. If you're shipping something, the six confirmations aren't a concern because you might not ship it in an hour. (With digital goods that cost you little to nothing to (send), it's not really a concern.)  Edge (moderator): The risk of a chargeback through PayPal is comparatively high.  Pair (BitPay): Bitcoin is the most counterfeit-proof form of payment that's ever been created.  Q. Audience member: Are you considering offering discounts to those who pay with bitcoins?  A. Dumontet (Foodler): Yes, absolutely. First off, we don't charge any fees beyond the exchange rate at the time that the order is received, and we would absolutely like to offer a discount (or reward points).  Johnston (Engine Inc.): We currently do offer a discount (of 10-20 percent). We're into the bitcoin community ... we want to drive the adoption. A bitcoin early-adopter is likely to tell other people about products they're using. I'm willing to pay that discount for bitcoin people and I would offer that as a great strategy in general for merchants ... There is a savings -- either split that or give it all back to the consumer.  Q. Audience member: What do you do with the bitcoins after you accept them -- keep them or convert to U.S. dollars?  A. Dumontet (Foodler): In order to pay (our restaurants) we must convert. (Note: none of Foodler's restaurant partners accept bitcoins directly as payment.)  Q. Edge (moderator): What about small-time merchants with only a few transactions a month?  A. Pair (BitPay): Somebody just accepting one payment a month might just want to put their bitcoin address out there ... (BitPay has to help merchants a lot with processing and customer service, Pair says.) Mt. Gox has a bug where it's very easy to send a bitcoin payment three or four times. (Then BitPay has to run the refunds for their customers, Pair notes.)  Q. Audience member: What new tools do you as merchants and vendors want to see?  A. Johnston (Engine Inc.): I have a lot of interest in colored coins (bitcoins given special properties to distinguish them from ""regular"" bitcoins). There is a real opportunity to use the existing blockchain for more than transactions ... I'm interested in pushing forward the implementation of colored coins. I can take a bitcoin, split it into a thousand fractions, add a little metadata and say this is one share in Company X. Then I can send you a share of Company X from my wallet to your wallet ... The first company that really cracks that for stocks and bonds will be really disruptive.  Dumontet (Foodler): I'd like to see reputation (data) built in to the system.  Pair (BitPay): Deterministic fees, so when you pay from your wallet, your wallet could tell you how big the fee should be to have statistical likelihood of getting into a block within a certain timeframe.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/19/bitpay-foodler-paymium-execs-talk-bitcoin-challenges-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe3310cd6d60a3052984976041bf6b9e2552fff0-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
