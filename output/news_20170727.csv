42379653,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KO4n,1501192850,Bitcoin Startup KeepKey Ends Support For Multibit Wallet Software,"The long-running bitcoin wallet Multibit is being discontinued, the firm that bought it last year has announced.  Dating back to 2011, Multibit was a popular choice among community members, hitting a one-million-downloads milestone in early 2014. And as CoinDesk reported in May of last year, hardware wallet provider KeepKey moved to acquire Multibit for an undisclosed amount that was denominated in bitcoin. The original developers behind Multibit departed the project following the sale.  Just over a year later, KeepKey CTO Ken Hodler has announced the startup will no longer maintain the wallet software.  The reason: the code, according to Hodler, is in dire need of a reworking, especially in the light of an overall increase in network fees as well as forthcoming changes to bitcoin's code aimed at increasing the thoughput of transactions.  He wrote in a blog post yesterday:  ""The reality is that Multibit is in need of a lot of work. It has stubborn bugs that have caused us and Multibit users much grief. Additionally, bitcoin has gone through a fundamental change in regards to the way fees work. The addition of SegWit in the coming weeks will mean the Multibit software has fallen still further behind.""  Support for the software, Hodler said, will be ending effective immediately, and he suggested that users move their funds to another wallet. He concluded the post by thanking the past developers of the wallet software.  ""Multibit was a fantastic piece of software in its time, and we want to thank the Multibit developers for such an important contribution to Bitcoin's history,"" he wrote.

Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who earned a number of boxing records in his years on the professional circuit, is set to fight boxer Conor McGregor in a highly-billed match on August 26. In a photo shared on Instagram just over an hour ago, Mayweather predicted that he would ""make a $hit t$n of money"" as a result of that fight – a comment made while seated in front of what appears to be a significant pile of money on a private jet.  Yet, in the same message, he also predicts that he will also strike it big during the ICO for Stox, a prediction market project that is launching its sale on August 2.  Here's the full Instagram post:          Champion Predictions: I'm gonna make a $hit t$n of money on August 26th.

The question that remains is – is it real? And if so, how involved is Mayweather in the project? While surprising, it's not unheard of for a major boxer to be involved in cryptocurrency, with Mike Tyson even once backing a bitcoin ATM.

42379642,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLk7,1501186550,'First' Ethereum Decompiler Launches With JP Morgan Quorum Integration,"The ethereum virtual machine (EVM) now has what appears to be its first ever decompiler designed to revert smart contracts into source code.  Announced onstage today by the founder of cybersecurity startup Comae Technologies at the DefCon hacker conference in Las Vegas, the open-source EVM decompiler was designed to make it easier to identify bugs in ethereum smart contracts.  Coming at a time when a string of ethereum hacks have exposed the difficulty of writing secure smart contract code, the decompiler, called Porosity, promises to let developers revert difficult to understand EVM bytecode back to its original state.  Porosity developer and Comae founder, Matt Suiche, told CoinDesk:  ""The initial problem I was trying to solve by writing a decompiler is to be able to have the actual source code, without having access to the actual source code by reverse engineering.""  Also announced today, Porosity is now integrated with JP Morgan's open-source Quorum blockchain created for enterprise-grade solutions, and it will now be available on the bank's Github page.  Tested with the help of some of JP Morgan's own engineers, Porosity and Quorum are expected to be packaged together to help run real-time smart contract security checks. The bundle, integrated directly into the Go-language ethereum implementation geth ""out of the box,"" incorporates security and patching processes for private networks with formal governance models.  JP Morgan blockchain lead Amber Baldet described to CoinDesk what she believes is the significance of the technology, stating:  ""Porosity is the first decompiler that generates human-readable Solidity syntax smart contracts from Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecode""  A time of need  While Suiche said he's new to blockchain, the serial entrepreneur who sold his previous startup to VMware was rather well prepared to build the decompiler.  As a reverse engineer, Suiche is familiar with starting with a product, and figuring out how to strip it down to its most basic parts.  So in February, when he began researching ethereum smart contracts in depth, he almost accidentally built the decompiler as part of his own personal research.  As Porosity's launch comes in a month when ethereum smart contracts written for CoinDash, Parity and Veritaseum have all been hacked, Suiche thinks his chosen profession as a reverse engineer is about to see increased demand.  ""The security community in ethereum is going to grow,"" he said ""And we're going to see more and more reverse engineers.""  The business of decompiling  Still, there's more to the business motivations driving decompiler use than just ensuring your funds remain secure.  Because vulnerabilities are frequently discovered long after a smart contract is implemented, an EVM decompiler can also bring peace of mind to investors, according to Alex Rass, CEO of customer software provider and cybersecurity consultant firm ITBS LLC.  According to Rass, decompilers are common among most ""major"" programming languages, in part because they help provide investors assurance that what they invested in is what is being used.  Rass said:  ""With a decompiler someone with half a brain can go, pull the contract binary code for that contract and see that contract, and provide investors with what they purchased.""

42379630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLTl,1501181464,Investor Howard Marks: Cryptocurrencies Aren't Real,"A noted investor is taking aim at bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, deeming them in a recent investor note as ""not real"".  Howard Marks is the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital, which according to its website reported $99 billion in assets under management as of last month. His comments come amid growing chatter amongst Wall Street analysts including those from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, to name a few.  Yet Marks – who according to CNBC gained notoriety for his prescient calls about both the dot-com bubble and the financial panic of the late 2000s – took a decidedly negative tack in a new memo earlier this week. Branding cryptocurrencies as ""an unfounded fad,"" he compared it to those previous episodes, as well as other economic situations like the South Sea Bubble from the 1700s.  He wrote:  ""In my view, digital currencies are nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or non beyond what people will pay for it. But this isn't the first time. The same description can be applied to the Tulip mania that peaked in 1637, the South Sea Bubble (1720) and the Internet Bubble (1999-2000).""  Questioning whether bitcoin's use for payments qualifies it as money, Marks goes on to raise doubt about the market's prospects should the prevailing optimism among speculators start to diminish.  ""What will happen to bitcoin's price and liquidity in a crisis if people decide they'd rather hold dollars (or gold)?"" he asked.  Later, Marks places the recent developments around cryptocurrencies in the wider context of the international market, including historically low yields on bonds and ""some of the highest equity valuations in history"".  He goes on to state that he's not saying that ""digital currencies are sure to end up worthless"" or that stock prices are too high today – rather, that the market today, in his view, is in a precarious state.  ""Not a nonsensical bubble – just high and therefore risky,"" he notes.

42379626,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLNT,1501175458,Indian State Officials to Weigh Policies for Public Sector Blockchain Use,"Officials in the Indian state of Karnataka are planning an event on blockchain and governance in the near future – a step that could ultimately lead to new regulations in the tech-oriented region.  Priyank Kharge, who spearheads Karnataka's information technology and bio-technology efforts, tweeted earlier this week that the state government ""will soon host a seminar to understand blockchains for governance & bitcoins"". This event, he said, could lead to new ""policy"", though he left little indications as to what that policy might entail. Regional news service The Economic Times first covered the statements.  That state officials would gather to discuss the tech, including bitcoin, is perhaps unsurprising, given that regulators in the country are currently engaged in a wide-ranging effort to create a new legal framework for cryptocurrencies.  Among the possible options is the imposition of a goods-and-services tax, though recent reports suggest that officials are still weighing which agencies would ultimately have jurisdiction over the tech, including India's central bank and its top securities market regulator.  Nor is Karnataka the only Indian state to move to potentially adopt or integrate the technology.  As CoinDesk has previously reported, the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are both purusing efforts that could see them implementing blockchain as part of a digital reworking of their land registry systems. In the case of Telagana, officials are looking at how the tech could improve their revenue operations as well.

42379627,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLRF,1501171247,A New SegWit Lock-In Period Has Started and All Mining Pools Are Signaling,"A new signaling period for the long-debated code change Segregated Witness (SegWit) just started — and it looks like it might be the last.  If at least 95% of blocks during the 2,016-block period signal support for the change, it will 'lock in' on the network, a move that would ensure the activation of the code, first proposed in 2015, on the bitcoin blockchain.  With it, bitcoin will be upgraded to remove transaction malleability, an issue that enabled users to manipulate unconfirmed transactions, and increase the network's capacity (though it remains disputed just how big this boost will be and how long it will be to take effect).  So far, 100% of blocks indicate that miners are in support, and there's no indication that mining pools will let up – should they fail to do so, their blocks would be orphaned, meaning they wouldn't be able to collect bitcoin's valuable block rewards.  At press time, bitcoin's block reward was roughly $35,000.  If miners continue to signal, SegWit will lock-in at block 479,808 (around August 8).

42379631,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLV1,1501167921,Irish Central Bank Chief: Blockchain is One of 'The Largest Policy Challenges',"New technologies like blockchain represent a major policy challenge, according to the head of Ireland's central bank.  According to a newly-published transcript from a speech in late May, Philip Lane, governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, said that the central bank has moved to establish an internal working group focused on financial technology innovation. It's an approach that other central banks have taken as technologies like blockchain are poised to potentially enhance or replace some of their infrastructure.  But opportunities aside, the tech also presents issues, Lane said during an event hosted by the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland.  He went on to say:  ""...novel innovations in the markets sector, such as distributed ledger and crypto currencies, may present the largest policy challenges given their complexity and novelty. Finally, we note that many Fintech start-ups will have limited regulatory expertise and this may present policy challenges in communicating the scope and requirements of the authorisation regime and the role of the Central Bank.""  Those perceived risks haven't stopped Ireland's private sector from testing the tech, however.  Last April, the Bank of Ireland – one of Ireland's ""Big Four"" banks – revealed that it was working on a trade reporting prototype in partnership with Deloitte, which itself has made Dublin a hub for its work with blockchain.  More recently, members in a major Irish fund managers group collaborated on a test of their own, similarly exploring the tech for use as a data reporting tool.

42379633,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLXX,1501164326,Bitcoin Investment Vehicle Fined $120k by Nasdaq Exchange,"The provider of a publicly traded bitcoin exchange-traded note (ETN) has been fined over $120,000 by Nasdaq Stockholm for infractions of exchange rules and financial regulations.  The stock exchange's Disciplinary Committee announced today that it had levied the fine because the company, XBT Provider, violated provisions in its Internal Rule Book and certain regulations of the Financial Instruments Trading Act.  As the result of its finding, the committee handed down a penalty of 1 million Swedish krona – an amount worth approximately $122,000 at press time.  Among those violations, according to the statement, were ""failing to ensure that the risk function reports to the board"" and ""failing to implement an audit of the company's internet and IT security."" The release also pointed to infractions related to annual reporting requirements.  The fine comes more than two years after regulators in Sweden first approved the ETN, which affords investors exposure to bitcoin without requiring them to actually purchase the cryptocurrency.  In a statement, XBT Provider's board of directors said that it accepted the decision, highlighting that ""the substantial majority of the infractions ... occurred within 2015 and the first six months of 2016."" During that period, XBT Provider was owned by the company behind bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner.  ""Since acquisition by the Global Advisors group an entirely new management team has been put in place, a major and comprehensive remediation project has been completed and the issuer's assets under management has grown ten-fold,"" the board said. ""Additionally, no personnel from the period prior to Global Advisor's acquisition remain engaged by the issuer.""  The news comes soon after the ETN's issuer revealed a major partnership in the UK.  Last month, XBT Provider announced that it was working with Hargreaves Lansdown, a decades-old asset manager, allowing their customers to purchase shares in the ETN.

42379635,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLa3,1501160411,Washington's New Cryptocurrency Exchange Rules Are Now in Effect,"New regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges have gone into effect in the U.S. state of Washington.  Following the passing of Senate Bill 5031 into law at the weekend, the state's money transmitter laws now apply to exchanges, meaning that they need to obtain a license from the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions and must provide a third-party audit of their data systems.  Among other requirements, the law also mandates a new transmitter bond requirement, with the figure being tied to the amount of currency exchanged during the previous year.  Lawmakers finalized the measure in April, sending it to the desk of Gov. Jay Inslee, who signed it days after work on the bill was completed. According to public records, the law went into effect on Sunday, July 23.  As CoinDesk has previously reported, lawmakers in the western U.S. state have been working since January to develop regulations for exchange startups.  The bill's passage wasn't without controversy, however. Cryptocurrency exchanges Poloniex and Bitfinex declared that they would would stop serving customers there, citing the new regulations.

42411663,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gldY22,1501158657,The DAO Report: Understanding the Risk of SEC Enforcement,"Jason Somensatto is counsel at Morvillo LLP where he focuses his practice on internal investigations, government enforcement actions and white-collar criminal matters.  In this opinion piece, Somensatto discusses the impact of a new SEC ruling on the use of blockchain-based tokens for fundraising, arguing that entrepreneurs should not ignore their legal risks.     Almost three years ago, I wrote an article about the potential legal implications of crowdfunding a cryptocurrency project through a token sale.  At the time, the article was intended as a cautionary note to the nascent initial coin offering (ICO) industry from my vantage point as a lawyer who spends much of his time opposite the SEC, arguing what constitutes a violation of U.S. securities laws.  Since then, the market for ICOs has ballooned, and ICOs have become a common and seemingly lucrative way to fund new decentralized applications like Tezos and Bancor. With the expansion of the ICO market, there has also been a steady increase in the discussion about their legal implications.  The primary issue that has been debated is whether tokens are or should be considered regulated securities under U.S. law. The answer to that question is important because the U.S. imposes strict regulations on the sales of regulated securities such as requiring filing of a detailed registration statement or limiting the offering to so-called accredited investors.  That issue came to a head this week when the SEC released a report in which it asserted for the first time that the sale of a distributed ledger token constituted an illegal sale of unregistered securities. This article is not intended to analyze the SEC's report as it is self-explanatory and surely many will analyze its wording carefully.  This article is instead intended to explain the risks of potential SEC enforcement actions now facing developers who conduct an ICO without accounting for the U.S. securities laws.  Up to this point, virtually every ICO has taken the position that its tokens are not securities. For developers who continue to hold that position, it is important to understand the risks being undertaken, and how the issue of whether a token is a security will actually be decided in any particular case.  Although the report noted that the question of whether a particular token is a security is an individualized inquiry based on the particular facts and circumstances, it also took the unusual step of explicitly directing the report to others selling distributed ledger tokens to raise capital, effectively putting the industry on notice.  The SEC enforcement process  Assuming we will see more ICOs subject to SEC scrutiny through investigations and potential enforcement actions, it is imperative that ICO developers understand how long and painful an SEC investigation can be.  The expectation that the SEC will provide its opinion quickly after a summary investigation is misguided. Most investigations take several months (often more than a year) and involve expansive document requests, numerous witness interviews and extended negotiations about charges and potential settlements.  During the investigation period, the SEC is primarily attempting to gather facts to determine if a violation of the securities laws occurred and deciding whether to file an enforcement action. As reflected by the findings in the report about the DAO, the SEC will go to great efforts to understand all aspects of the relevant conduct and will dissect every comment made by an ICO developer before taking a position.  At the end of an investigation, absent a settlement, the SEC may choose to bring a formal enforcement action either through an in-house administrative proceeding or via a civil lawsuit in federal court. In anticipation of a formal hearing in front of a judge or jury, traditional discovery practices may apply to some extent, so there could be another round of document production, depositions, and also motions practice.  Finally, the alleged wrongdoer's case is decided at a hearing or trial that often takes place years after the conduct at issue.  To fully understand the inconvenience and cost of this process, it is worth noting that my firm is representing multiple clients in SEC enforcement actions with respect to transactions that date back more than five years.  When the legal issue gets decided  Beyond the sheer length, cost and invasiveness of an SEC enforcement action, developers should consider how their legal position that their tokens are not securities will be resolved.  During the initial investigation, there are some opportunities to make important legal arguments, often in the form of written submissions. However, the audience for these arguments is typically just the staff enforcement lawyer or their superiors in the enforcement division.  By the nature of their positions, these lawyers are often biased in favor of interpreting facts in a manner that will allow them to bring a case. Although some can be open-minded to legal arguments during an investigation, considering the recent report issued about the DAO tokens, it seems unlikely that the enforcement attorneys would start an investigation without having already developed a position that generally disfavors the argument that a particular token is not a security.  Rather, it should be assumed that the staff will either be antagonistic to the argument or posture about leaving such a thorny legal issue up to a judge or jury.  Even if the SEC walks away from an investigation into a token sale based on a compelling argument that the securities laws are not implicated, unlike in the circumstance involving the DAO, that decision will not be made public and there will be no precedent under which others will be able to easily argue that future token sales do not constitute securities offerings.  So, the risk to others of an investigation does not go away once the first development team successfully avoids formal SEC charges.  Most people facing potential formal charges by the SEC ultimately settle before a lawsuit can be filed. In the event of a settlement, the SEC will require that an order stating the SEC's position be issued to the public, similar to the report issued about the DAO.  Although those facing charges have some input over the content and wording of a settlement order, it is usually written from the perspective of the SEC in a manner that suggests wrongdoing by the settling party. The only acknowledgment of a competing position is usually a short statement noting that the alleged wrongdoer neither admits nor denies the allegations in the order.  In the context of an ICO enforcement action, that means any settlement will most certainly allege that the token sale constituted the illegal sale of unregistered securities.  Assuming developers have not run out of money or lost faith in their convictions, and thus chosen to litigate against the SEC instead of settle, the legal issue of whether the relevant token is in fact a security will ultimately come to a resolution as part of the formal proceeding.  At that point, an SEC-employed administrative law judge or a federal judge or jury with likely no background in decentralized applications or the basics of ICOs will decide the issue. The SEC, in an effort to make its case, will argue all the reasons why, for example, the $5 million you raised from U.S. investors to fund a brand new type of file sharing program looks a lot like the DAO token sale and every other capital raise that the SEC regulates once you brush away the technical jargon.  Frankly, your legal argument may look a lot weaker in the context of how it is actually decided than it does when discussing it with your tech-savvy lawyer who is also heavily invested in numerous ICOs.  This summary is not intended to suggest that fighting the SEC on this issue is a lost cause. However, developers must understand that the decision of whether a token is a security will likely only come after months of investigation, back and forth between lawyers, and may be decided by someone not familiar with distributed ledger technology.  Talk to a lawyer before your ICO  This raises one point worth a quick discussion: if you are considering an ICO, it is important that you speak to a lawyer about your project.  Not only will a lawyer help you potentially mitigate the risk of running afoul of the law, the truth is that if the SEC does come to investigate, the fact that you relied on a lawyer's advice could help you avoid charges.  That being said, be wary of any lawyer giving you a blanket opinion that an ICO can be easily structured to avoid the securities law and the precedent set by the report issued this week. This is a naive position that fails to understand the impact of the SEC's report and how the securities law work.  Rather, a good lawyer will want to know all about your project before providing any opinion or advice, and will likely seek to impose changes to ensure compliance with the securities laws.  Influential figures in the community have already opined that other ICOs should be able to avoid the DAO's fate, and I have even written about some of the different characteristics between distributed ledger tokens and traditional securities.  However, at this stage, developers should be highly skeptical of anyone claiming to be able to structure an ICO that will not run the risk of being subject to SEC scrutiny.  Future outlook  A fundamental risk when planning for an ICO that must be considered is the risk of potential SEC enforcement in this new area that does not have easily applicable precedent.  The SEC explicitly noted in the DAO report that its findings were intended to put the industry on notice.  As a result, I doubt this is the last we will hear from the SEC on this issue, and I expect future enforcement action releases for those who blindly continue raising capital through ICOs.  Developers should understand the risk posed by such a strategy and how the issue will be resolved before rushing to raise money and ending up in the SEC's crosshairs.

42379632,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLWH,1501155014,The Uniform Law Commission Has Given States a Clear Path to Approach Bitcoin,"Peter Van Valkenburgh is director of research at Coin Center, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit research and advocacy group focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  In this opinion piece, Van Valkenburgh analyzes new model legislation that he believes could clear the way for U.S. states to broadly regulate bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, while still encouraging innovation.      The Uniform Law Commission (ULC), a private body of lawyers and legal academics, has voted to finalize and approve a uniform model law for the regulation of virtual currency businesses.  Now an official model for states to follow, I'm hopeful that over the next year, we'll see state after state pass this language as legislation. For states with badly drafted regulations (like the New York ""BitLicense"") or vague money transmission statutes that may or may not cover bitcoin businesses (like in California), this new legislation would be a major improvement and a huge win for our community.  For one thing, the model act's language is explicitly clear on what types of digital currency businesses are and are not regulated.  In many states, poorly written or outdated legal language that does not account for the properties of open blockchain networks has created legal gray areas for entrepreneurs. Whether or not they even need licenses is often open to interpretation – a looming prospect that hangs over the head of anyone trying to build a business in those states.

Under the ULC's model act, precise and sensible definitions are laid out that specifically encompass only businesses models in which a third party takes control of user funds, because only in those situations can that third party then lose or steal the funds.  Therefore, any licensing system meant to protect consumers should only cover those businesses and exclude all others. An example can help explain how this could work in practice.  Imagine someone earning bitcoins by running a node on the Lightning Network. The node operator is helping hold some bitcoin transactions off-chain until they eventually are settled on the bitcoin blockchain. Prior to settlement, the node operator is part of a multi-sig payment channel that is holding those bitcoins. There is no way the node operator can steal or otherwise lose those coins.  So, should they be licensed?  Under California’s money transmission law, the determination is based on whether or not the business is ""receiving money for transmission."" And under New York's BitLicense, the question is whether the business is ""receiving virtual currency for transmission or transmitting virtual currency, except where the transaction is undertaken for non-financial purposes and does not involve the transfer of more than a nominal amount of virtual currency.""  Neither of those rules cleanly accounts for the Lightning Network arrangement, which means they are open to interpretation by the regulator. Suddenly, simply running a Lightning node could require you to hire a lawyer and go through an expensive process just to figure out if you need to go through an even more expensive licensing process.  Clearer picture  Under the ULC model act, that gray area is totally eliminated.  It is clearly spelled out that licensure is only required of companies that have control of a customer’s cryptocurrency, with control defined as the ""power to execute unilaterally or prevent indefinitely a virtual currency transaction.""  A Lightning Network node does not have that power, so they are not covered. Easy.  But it isn't just about Lightning Network nodes. You can run any sort of activity through this test and come up with an easy answer about whether it would be regulated. If you are a bitcoin exchange holding people’s bitcoins for them? Yes, you have control, you need a license.  But with almost anything else, you don't. Try the test with mining, software wallet development, core development, key recovery services and running a full node. In all those cases you cannot ""unilaterally execute or indefinitely prevent"" transactions with someone else's bitcoins; you just can't and therefore you are excluded from the regulation.  Try running any of those activities through California or New York's tests, and you will end up with more questions than answers.  The ULC model act also has a clear exemption for people or businesses using digital currencies on their own behalf. That means over-the-counter traders, token creators, miners selling their rewards, or people helping their family members acquire some digital currencies are all clearly free of any restrictions.  Regulatory clarity like this has been the stuff of dreams for digital currency entrepreneurs for years now. Coin Center and others have made modest progress approaching states one by one, although, more often than not, our victories have been helping a state turn a very unsound approach into a slightly less unsound approach.  Now, with the passage of the ULC's model act, states wanting to pursue a licensing approach have been handed the best possible path to encouraging digital currency innovation by a trusted body of lawmakers.

42379641,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLir,1501149627,The Rate of Blockchain Patent Applications Has Nearly Doubled in 2017,"The number of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related patent applications being submitted and published in the US has nearly doubled in 2017.  Data from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database, analyzed by CoinDesk, indicates that there were 390 patent applications related broadly to blockchain technology published between January and July of this year.  Overall, this represents a 90% increase compared to the same period in 2016, when 204 applications were sent to the USPTO.  The dataset includes combined keyword search results using terms such as ""bitcoin,"" ""ethereum,"" ""blockchain"" and ""distributed ledger,"" among others.  With growing interests from both public and private sector, the data supports the notion blockchain is experiencing a research and development boom. The past several months have seen applications related to bitcoin mining derivatives, in-car cryptocurrency payments and blockchain-based shareholder voting, to name just a few.  The degree of growth is even more apparent when you look at the number of applications over the past five years. In 2012, just 71 related applications were filed, compared to 469 over the course of 2016.  Figures for the number of related patents being awarded are also growing, according to the data.  The number of patents granted increased from 70 in 2013 to 152 in 2016. However, the pass rate of applications has been declining.  While in 2011 and 2012 most of the application were granted, applications in 2015 and 2016 only saw a roughly 50% chance of success, based on the number ultimately awarded.  Several patent awards have made headlines recently, capping long-standing efforts to secure intellectual property around the technology. These include Goldman Sachs, which was granted its ""SETLcoin"" cryptocurrency patent, and AT&T, which was awarded a patent for a bitcoin-powered subscriber server.

42379638,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLdp,1501146018,Philippine Central Bank Sees Few Applicants for Crypto Exchange License,"The central bank of the Philippines has seen little interest from exchanges after instituting a new regulatory framework for digital currencies, according to a recent report.  In an interview with domestic publication Business Mirror, Chuchi Fonacier, who works for the supervision and examination division of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), remarked that ""less than 10"" applications have been submitted since those new rules went into effect in February.  That month  , the BSP stated that companies seeking to start a cryptocurrency exchange service in the country must apply for a license and adhere to anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements.  Still, Fonacier's statements indicate that the response has underwhelmed the regulator.  ""We have reviewed the business models of some of the applicants and are awaiting their submission of additional requirements,"" Fonacier said.  Another potential factor is that besides the license and registration process, BSP is requiring that exchanges periodically submit reports in order to keep close eyes on the trading volume and use of cryptocurrencies in the country.  While no other additional regulations are being considered at this point, Fonacier said the BSP will ""continue to monitor developments in this area and stand ready to take appropriate action on significant risks that may arise.""

42379625,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLOj,1501142403,Malta Is Gearing up to Greenlight Bitcoin Gambling,"The nation of Malta – long a pioneer in internet gambling – is quickly moving ahead with plans to allow for the legal use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at online casinos.  In a new interview, Joseph Cuschieri, executive chairman of the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), which oversees the country's land-based and online casinos, said that the regulatory body has commissioned a detailed technical study to explore the best path forward for legal and regulated cryptocurrency use in gambling.  ""We believe that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are emerging innovations which need analysis and an assessment of the risks and opportunities for potential adoption in the gaming sector,"" he said.  Cuschieri told CoinDesk:  ""The shape and form of the framework governing cryptocurrencies will be announced in due course and once the risk assessment is carried out. Once the results of the study are evaluated, the MGA will make its position official on how cryptocurrencies will be adopted.""  The agency expects to detail the findings from its study in the fourth quarter of 2017.  A piece of the puzzle  Cuschieri's comments come on the heels of a recently released white paper by the MGA exploring how its legal and regulatory approach to online gambling must evolve to keep pace with technology.  One of the report's conclusions is that cryptocurrencies should be embraced for purposes of competitive advantage, and because more widespread use and application of these technologies is certain.  It stated:  ""The Authority is cognizant that the rise of crypto-currencies is inevitable. Conscious of the need to remain at the forefront of innovation and to keep up with new developments in technology and the industry ... the Authority is committed to allow the use of cryptocurrencies by its licensees in the immediate future.""  The push for legal and regulated cryptocurrency gambling is a component of a broader, aggressive push by the Maltese government to develop a blockchain strategy and position itself at the forefront of the technology's adoption.  ""We must be on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation, and we cannot just wait for others to take action and copy them. We must be the ones that others copy,"" Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said in April when the draft strategy was first revealed.  Silvio Schembri, Malta’s parliamentary secretary for digital economy, told local press this week that the island is committed to rolling out distributed ledger technology throughout the public sector and attracting blockchain companies.  He said:  ""We've heard enough about the opportunities posed by blockchain and it's now time to put words into action to create new opportunities for both citizens and the economy. It's my priority to turn this vision into a reality.""  Juggling demands  But creating a regulatory framework for the fast-moving technology requires balancing the careful study of consumer protection and anti-money laundering implications with competitive pressures from other jurisdictions.  Bitmalta, a local cryptocurrency advocacy group, applauded the MGA's initiative, but called upon the agency to move quickly in order to keep pace with other nations looking at legalized cryptocurrency gambling.  The group said in a statement:  ""Other jurisdictions such as the UK have already legislated in favor of the use of cryptocurrencies by remote gaming operators, and unless Malta wants to play second fiddle to such other jurisdictions, it should ramp up its efforts to embrace such technologies.""  Cuschieri insisted that while a key goal is to attract new operators and investment to the island, he wouldn’t be welcoming in just anybody.  ""Our key priority is always the integrity of our jurisdiction. Whoever does not meet our fit and proper, regulatory, anti-money laundering and consumer protection standards is not welcome in Malta,"" he said.  Out of the shadows  Bitcoin and cryptocurrency casinos have been one of the predominant applications of blockchain technology since its invention a decade ago, but many of these entities have operated out of unregulated or lightly regulated jurisdictions – raising concerns about their use by unsavory actors.  Cuschieri reckons that the most straightforward way to tame illicit behavior is to bring these types of casinos out of the shadows.  ""We firmly believe that the best way to control gambling, prevent criminal activity and protect players is through robust and effective regulation and enforcement,"" he said, adding:  ""Prohibition or barriers only lead to underground activities and black market operations. The latter is not in the best interest of players and the sector in general. That is why it is best to establish transparent regulatory regimes so that we bring integrity and trust into the system.""

42379636,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KLcZ,1501118449,$110 Million: BTC-e Fined as US Vows Crackdown on Bitcoin Exchanges,"The US government has unsealed an indictment against BTC-e and one of its alleged operators, levying a $110 million fine for violations allegedly committed by the long-running bitcoin exchange.  In the 21-count indictment released earlier this evening, the Department of Justice alleged that BTC-e and Alexander Vinnik, the Russian national who was arrested earlier today in Greece and later linked to the long-running exchange, committed a laundry list of crimes throughout the exchange's six-year history.  Federal prosecutors allege that BTC-e functioned as a clearing house for illicit funds sourced from ""computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings.""  Vinnik was charged with 17 counts of money laundering and two counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions. Both BTC-e (by way of an alleged holding company named Canton Business Corporation) and Vinnik were also charged with one count of operating an unlawful money services business and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Prosecutors further alleged that Vinnik ""received funds from the infamous computer intrusion or 'hack' of Mt. Gox"" – echoing claims released earlier today by the independent research group WizSec, which has investigated the theft of funds from the now-defunct Japan-based bitcoin exchange.  According to the Department of Justice, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) assessed a $110 million civil penalty against BTC-e, as well as a $12 million penalty against Vinnik.  If convicted, Vinnik faces as many as 55 years in prison.  Stern rebuke  But, in announcing the unsealed indictment, government officials issued stark warnings to digital currency exchanges.  Acting FinCEN director Jamal El-Hindi said in a statement:  ""We will hold accountable foreign-located money transmitters, including virtual currency exchangers, that do business in the United States when they willfully violate U.S. AML laws.""  Notably absent from the statements were indications as to whether the US government would move to permanently shutter the exchange, which just hours ago said that it would return to service.
