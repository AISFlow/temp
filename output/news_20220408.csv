Every crypto user, be it a rookie or expert, has at least heard the term consensus mechanism. Consensus mechanisms are systems set in blockchains to secure the network by ensuring that only responsible parties add new transactions. The two most popular consensus mechanisms are Proof of Work and Proof of stake. PoW came about by the launch of Bitcoin, but experts discovered that it consumes massive amounts of resources. Hence, PoW was deemed inefficient for new chains. Now came the rise of PoS. In PoS, the network allows participants to hold some stakes in the native currency and participate in authenticating and validating transactions. PoS is considered an energy and cost-efficient consensus mechanism. After the first introduction of PoS, other projects followed with their versions. Today, the guide discusses three of the most prominent blockchains using PoS, answering the question of who will win the race.

The Senate Republican Policy Committee (RPC), chaired by U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), works to form legislative policy goals for the party, as well as provide research and analysis on a variety of subjects.  The short policy paper, titled “Cryptocurrency Goes Mainstream,” was published on April 7, and explores both the benefits and the “dark side” of cryptocurrency. While the paper touts the potential for crypto to “reduce transaction costs and speeds and to increase privacy,” it also calls attention to crypto’s role in “nefarious purposes” like ransomware attack payments, scams, speculation and drug trafficking.  Though nothing in the paper is new information, the paper itself is noteworthy because it demonstrates the development of a more cohesive Republican policy position on crypto. Senate Republicans have been, on the whole, more supportive of the crypto industry than Senate Democrats, but policy efforts have been sporadic.  Varying levels of crypto education have also been a challenge on Capitol Hill. While some lawmakers are crypto-savvy, others – as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has claimed on multiple occasions – could not explain “what in the hell a cryptocurrency is.”  The RPC’s paper is a sign that those days could be numbered.  In President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto issued last month, he called for a whole-of-government approach to crypto regulation – something the RPC’s paper notes.  “These objectives [in the EO] included protecting consumers, investors, and businesses and ensuring privacy; maintaining financial stability; and guarding against illicit uses such as money laundering and ransomware,” the report reads.  “The order also called for the U.S. to continue leading the development of digital assets and for promoting access to affordable financial services,” it adds.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/08/gop-policy-arm-releases-paper-exploring-benefits-risks-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76a7ea6ce1392094af8366df38b090626f646ccb-5641x3760.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394250,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvagdP,1649450413,The Meaning of Miami's Castrated Bitcoin Bull,"Standing 11 feet tall and glistening in the southern sun, “The Miami Bull” statue has been called both “a crime against god” and “pretty cool.” The robotic reimagining of the Wall Street landmark is 3,000 pounds, made of chrome and fiberglass and sports blue laser eyes. Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez said it speaks to the city’s vitality.  “I can tell you, [in] Miami we have big balls. That's all I can tell you,” he said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday.  The statue, however, does not.  Almost immediately after it was unveiled outside the Miami Beach Convention Center on Monday, kicking off the first day of the global Bitcoin 2022 conference, observers noted the robotic totem with hooves and horns lacked that one crucial anatomical detail. Its creator, Furio Tedeschi, hadn’t intended for the bull to be a steer.  “I’d designed some huge, mechanical balls,” Tedeschi, who has done art design for the “Transformers” film series, from which his latest work draws inspiration, told Forbes. Apparently, TradeStation, the Florida-based trading platform that commissioned the mechanical statue removed those assets to avoid feeding the gendered stereotypes about finance.  Suarez, who spoke at the bull’s unveiling, is working to turn Miami into a hub of modern finance – the “capital of capital,” he often says. He has drawn paychecks in bitcoin, offers tax incentives for crypto, fintech and investment firms to relocate and even christened the city’s own cryptocurrency, Miami Coin.  “I think what it symbolizes is the metamorphosis from the old economy to the new economy,” Suarez said, about the bull.  The bull is a potent sign of energy coursing through Miami and the cryptocurrency industry. But it is odd that this ""new economy"" is using the language and imagery of the old. Has much really changed?  Asked just that, Suarez disclaimed credit. “And of course, you know, this is something that TradeStation did, I didn't do it, you know, their idea, to be honest with you,” he said.  (He also walked back his previous steadfast support of Miami's Stacks-based ""city coin,"" saying it's ""too inflationary"" to be useful as a currency, though praising the demand for and ""tremendous buzz"" around it. ""It's a great idea, but ... you have to get all the dynamics right. And and I think that dynamic is a little out of whack,"" he said.)  See also: Miami Mayor Previews 'Favorable' Crypto Policy  Bulls on parade  Miami’s bull is not the first to challenge Wall Street. “Fearless Girl” was installed on March 7, 2017, the day before International Women’s Day, in front of the famed “Charging Bull” statue, where it remains standing today.  Designed by feminist sculptor Kristen Visbal, and commissioned by asset-management firm State Street to advertise its gender-diversity index fund, the statue has both been hailed as protest against corporate America’s lack of diversity and criticized as commercialist propaganda.  Visbal, in fact, is engaged in a years-long legal dispute with State Street over the right to sell miniatures and recastings of “Fearless Girl.” Last year, she sold non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of the stalwart child partly to fund her legal campaign.  Some who gaze upon the robo-bull might see a new path forward. For all crypto’s faults, including being captured by the industry it looks to supplant, it offers an alternative to traditional finance. Decentralized systems are truly user blind and open to all.  Perhaps that’s the message TradeStation wanted to communicate.  Whether a statement of protest or something more gauche, “The Miami Bull” is here to stay. TradeStation President and CEO John Bartleman told CoinDesk TV the statue will move in front of Miami Dade College after the crypto conference wraps.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/08/the-meaning-of-miamis-castrated-bitcoin-bull,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac1bdc5691af2bcbdd3189626f736c1de5d7be62-1854x1358.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374910,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw42h7,1649450332,Wax Studio’s Blockchain Brawlers Game Earns $357M in First Week,"In this corner, Axie Infinity, sucker-punched by a $620 million breach.  In the other corner, another play-to-earn (P2E) game claiming to be more secure and featuring a rowdy bunch of non-fungible tokens (NFT).  Wax Studios’ Blockchain Brawlers has earned $357 million in trading volume in just one week, according to a company press release.  Since the game’s beta version went live on the Wax blockchain on March 30, players have earned daily, on average, 3,200 BRWL, the game's native token.  Wax Studios is affiliated with World Asset eXchange (WAX).  Wax Studios head Michael Rubinelli told CoinDesk via phone call his company’s game draws players by “instantaneously” allowing purchases to be implemented into gameplay via the Wax blockchain.  “As gamers, we lose and we run away and when we want to go buy the biggest gun or the most gigantic ax, we want it right now,” said Rubinelli on transaction speed while gaming on Wax.  In Blockchain Brawlers players purchase NFT brawlers and equipment in WAX, the chain’s native token, or BRWL, the game’s native token, and battle other players to earn BRWL rewards.  GameFi has been in the news recently after the recent $625 million hack of the Ronin blockchain that supports Axie Infinity.  Rubinelli claims that won't happen with Blockchain Brawlers because the layer 1, or base, blockchain supporting his game makes it less likely to be hacked. Axie Infinity was attacked through the Ronin Bridge, which enables users to pass funds between the Ronin network and Ethereum.  However, Wax has a bridge of its own, with Binance’s BNB chain. Soon, it will have a bridge on Ethereum, said Rubinelli.  Critics have pointed out the “digital serfdom” created by Axie stemming from the high barrier to entry to play. Similarly, in Blockchain Brawlers the floor price for a brawler and a ring, the items necessary to play, is a hefty $6,000.  Often players in P2E games rent out their assets to other players who cannot afford to purchase the NFTs, which means renters may become involved in long hours of gameplay with little in the way of payment.

Some of the top cryptocurrency exchanges for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are Binance, Coinbase, FTX, and others. What is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)? Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a fork of Bitcoin (BTC) that was created in 2017. During the split, Bitcoin holders are rewarded with the same ratio of 1 BTC to 1 BCH. In November 2018, Bitcoin Cash split into Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Satoshi Version. Bitcoin Cash has a low transaction fee with a higher speed when compared to Bitcoin. The block size of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) during the fork was 8MB, which was later increased to 32MB in October 2021. Now, we shall consider the price analysis of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for the coming years.

Bitcoin (BTC) traded lower after failing to break above $44,000 during the New York trading day. Meanwhile, NEAR, the cryptocurrency powering layer 1 blockchain Near, rose by as much as 20% over the past 24 hours. WAVES declined by 10% and XRP was down by 3% over the same period.  The dispersion in crypto returns suggests uncertainty among traders after a near 7% dip in BTC over the past week. Further, alternative cryptos (altcoins) have fallen in and out of favor as investor sentiment shifts between bullish and bearish.  Just launched!

Shallow speculation  The bitcoin futures market has been relatively quiet, which suggests that BTC's 30% rise from its Jan. 24 low around $33,000 was driven by spot traders.  The chart below shows bitcoin's total open interest, or number of outstanding derivative contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which has ticked lower over the past week. Participation in the bitcoin futures market has waned since peak levels in November of last year, which preceded a 50% drop in BTC's price.  Still, the current level of open interest is higher than its previous range between May and September of 2021.  Analysts also pointed to a reduction in leverage among bitcoin futures traders, which indicates lower conviction behind the latest price recovery.  Further, BTC's annualized rolling three-month basis, or the relative difference between the price of the future contract and the spot price, has declined across major exchanges over the past two weeks. That indicates uncertainty among traders about the future price of bitcoin.

42394240,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaftF,1649448153,Don’t Expect Carefully Researched Crypto Regulations,"On March 9, the Biden administration issued an executive order directing U.S. regulators to “assess the financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by the ongoing adoption of digital assets” and to recommend specific policy, regulatory and legislative actions within 180 days.  Many in the crypto industry are celebrating that order as a call for careful, well-researched regulations as opposed to a hasty and clumsy rush to judgment. Such enthusiasm, however, may be premature.  Thomas L. Hogan is senior research faculty at the American Institute for Economic Research (AIER). He was formerly chief economist for the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.  The heads of the U.S. regulatory agencies already claim to conduct careful analysis that weighs the costs and benefits of new rules before putting them into effect. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, for example, described cost-benefit analysis as “a very fundamental part of what we do.”  Yet evidence from existing regulations contradicts such claims. It suggests that a careful approach to the regulation of cryptocurrency is highly unlikely.  Read more: Top US Lawmaker Proposes Sweeping Stablecoin Regulation Framework  Regulatory cost-benefits analysis  In a recent paper, I reviewed the proposed and final versions of 27 of the most important changes in bank capital and liquidity regulations from 1986 to 2018 in order to assess whether U.S. regulators evaluate the effects of new regulations thoroughly.  I found that in zero – yes, zero – of these cases did the regulators conduct a quantitative cost-benefit analysis to ensure that their regulations would not harm the banking system or the U.S. economy.  In five of the 27 cases, the regulatory proposals claim that the new rule would create net benefits for the economy. But if you read the proposals carefully, you find that is not so. In each case, they initially claim that the benefits are large, but they later admit that the magnitudes of the benefits are actually unknown.  In the 2003 implementation of the rules known as Basel II, for example, the rule proposal states that “the anticipated benefits well exceed the anticipated costs” (emphasis added). They later acknowledge, however, that the benefits of the rule cannot be measured since they are “more qualitative than quantitative.” If the benefits cannot be measured, how can we know that they “well exceed” the costs?  Similar language is used in other proposals. The 2011 market risk capital rules discuss only “qualitative benefits.” The 2013 liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) regulation describes the evidence as “qualitative in nature.” No quantitative evidence is ever provided.  The regulators claim that the benefits of their rules exceed the costs, but in reality, they have no idea how big the benefits are.  The costs of regulation  Uncertainty about the benefits of regulations might not matter if the regulations had no costs. But there are always costs. The costs of regulation might be borne by consumers, bank employees, corporate stakeholders, or even U.S. taxpayers.  New rules increase the complexity of the regulatory system, which – like a complex tax code – enables banks to avoid their regulatory burdens. Complex regulations are less effective at identifying bank risk. They can even push banks to take more risk than they normally would, such as regulations that encouraged banks to increase their holdings of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, which turned out to be a major cause of the 2008 financial crisis.  Regulations greatly increase banks’ operating and compliance costs. That disproportionately affects smaller banks that cannot afford teams of lawyers and compliance officers, and it creates barriers to entry that limit competition. Following the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, for example, only one new bank was chartered from 2011 to 2016, compared with an average of 144 per year from 2000 to 2007.  Restricting competition raises the costs of borrowing for businesses that want to expand and hire more workers. In this way, regulations harm low-skilled workers in the form of lower wages and fewer jobs, which has been shown to substantially increase racial inequality and income inequality.  While regulators are unclear about the benefits of regulations, they consistently underestimate the costs. None of the 27 rule proposals I reviewed considers the costs of greater inequality or how regulatory complexity might increase bank risk.  Read more:Top US Bank Watchdog Warns of Stablecoins' 'Lack of Interoperability'  Low-quality research  I found several instances in which the regulatory proposals misstated or misrepresented the research they cited. Sometimes they misinterpreted the findings of a paper or did not understand the difference between the study’s assumptions and its results.  In a few cases, the research cited by the regulators actually showed that their proposed rules would lead to net costs rather than net benefits. For example, the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) rule does not include cost-benefit analysis, but it does rely on a study from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The regulators claim that the BCBS study shows that the NSFR would benefit the U.S. economy.  But what the BCBS study actually says is that in its base-case scenario the NSFR creates a net benefit only when bank capital ratios are below 11%. When capital ratios are above 11%, the rule will reduce growth in the economy (and therefore in living standards).  At the time the NSFR was proposed in 2016, every bank subject to the rule had a capital ratio above 11%. Every single one! Thus, the BCBS study cited by the regulators themselves showed that the NSFR rule would be harmful to society.  This is the level of shoddy research you should expect in proposals to regulate the crypto industry.  Not-so-great expectations  Anyone predicting careful, well-researched crypto regulations needs to lower their expectations. It ain’t gonna happen. At least not if history is a useful guide.  Most financial regulators do not conduct cost-benefit analysis of new regulations. Regulators often claim that the benefits of a rule exceed the costs, even while admitting that the benefits are unknown. They ignore the unintended consequences of increasing inequality and financial risk. In some cases, the research cited in favor of their proposed rules actually shows that those rules will on net be harmful to society.  The cryptocurrency industry should look with skepticism on the promises of regulators and politicians. Their claims of careful, well-researched regulations are simply unfounded.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Thomas Hogan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk/2022/04/08/dont-expect-carefully-researched-crypto-regulations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/141e39abe8317382e50b88bcde29f5e52e7accc8-1740x1160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The initial stagnation ends with an increase of more than 10% for both Ether and Bitcoin, which has a visible impact on the crypto market share. Some events are shaping the future of crypto on the world trade stage. Some such activities will immediately impact the market influence of the cryptocurrency platforms, while others have long-term effects. The following are notable milestones that cryptocurrencies are likely to experience during the year: Migration of Transactions to Layer 2 The migration of crypto transactions from the main chain of networks like Ethereum to layer 2 is a move that will increase transaction speeds. The new development aims to ensure that the blockchain networks can handle up to thousands of transactions per second (TPS). Achieving the milestone will increase network reliability, which creates a chance for growth in the number of users. If the migration is successful, main chains will only have the function of holding final blocks to secure the network. Moving away from transactional activities on the main layer will ensure improved network security. The exclusive role of verifying and recording transaction blocks on the blockchain will reduce the chances of security lapses.

The limit is intended to stop wealthy Russians from circumventing a cap on investing in the EU introduced in the wake of the Ukraine invasion.  The measure was set out in broad terms by the European Commission earlier Friday, and the full details of the legislation have now been disclosed. The law prohibits providing high-value crypto wallet, account or custody services above the limit to Russian people or entities, with an exemption for those who are EU nationals or residents.  Sanctions measures introduced Feb. 25, the day after the invasion, forbid Russians transferring more than €100,000 to EU bank accounts. Officials chose a lower limit for crypto transactions.  European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently warned crypto was being used to evade sanctions, despite little evidence.  In an FAQ posted April 4, the commission said crypto was included in existing asset freezes, and on March 9 the bloc extended the definition of ""transferable securities"" to include virtual assets.

42394248,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvagT9,1649444759,"No, DeFi Is Not a Repeat of the 2008 Crisis","Charlie Warzel’s generally quite readable Galaxy Brain newsletter carried a provocative headline this week: “Is Crypto Re-Creating the 2008 Financial Crisis?”  Not surprisingly, it turned out to be a rhetorical question. The Atlantic writer’s newsletter carried an interview with American University law professor Hilary J. Allen in which she discussed her recent paper arguing that decentralized finance is repeating the mistakes of “shadow banking” that preceded the financial turmoil of the late 2000s.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Allen’s thesis is that the high degree of complexity around DeFi’s innovative new models for borrowing, lending, insurance and payments will leave the same lack of clarity around looming risks that credit default swaps (CDS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) fostered during the pre-crisis housing bubble. “Complexity-induced opacity increases the chance that such risks will be underestimated in good times (causing bubbles), and overestimated in bad times (making panics worse),” she writes.  Allen is urging the U.S. government to step in to regulate the sector before it becomes more integrated into the mainstream financial system. She argues that decentralized applications (dapps) should be licensed and their founders and developers subject to enforcement actions if they are non-compliant.  That won’t sit well with many in the crypto community, where the idea that open-source coders can be charged with wrongdoing is seen as chilling to innovation.  First, let me acknowledge there’s some truth in Allen’s DeFi observations and that some of the parallels she draws to the financial crisis are legitimate and important.  It’s true the average person can’t hope to understand DeFi. Much like how Wall Street’s financial engineers exploited the black box of CDS and CDOs to the eventual detriment of bank customers, that complexity also gives DeFi project founders asymmetric advantages. It’s why “rug pulls” and other abuses of overly trusting investors are common.  Other valid observations from Allen: There’s an awful lot of 2008 bubble-like behavior in DeFi now, and there’s a lot more centralization with trusted intermediaries than “decentralization” enthusiasts acknowledge.  But there's a fundamental flaw in Allen’s perspective, one that could lead to a major policy error.  The elephant in the room  The overwhelming difference between DeFI innovators in the 2020s and those of Wall Street in the 2000s is that the latter – the bankers – operated within an all-encompassing political framework that the former – the crypto developers – are untouched by. With their power to create money through fractional reserve lending, banks function as the government’s agents of monetary policy, a specially sanctioned position that comes with privileged access to the Federal Reserve’s liquidity. There’s an interdependence between governments and banks that has, at times, morphed into codependence.  Exhibit A: the “too big to fail” problem in the lead-up to the financial crisis. This was the idea that a potential collapse in a big, systemically interconnected bank would pose such a catastrophic threat to the economy that the government would always have no option but to bail out such institutions if they ran into trouble – precisely what happened in 2008.  It was a moral hazard problem that, in the 2000s, fueled a massive market distortion. Before the crisis, banks faced asymmetric risks. They could profit from successes while the mortgage market was hot but faced no consequences if and when it turned south. The result was a warped, distorted version of capitalism in which profits were privatized and losses socialized.  In the reference that Allen makes to this, she mostly uses it to dismiss crypto enthusiasts as naive, suggesting their interest in DeFi is motivated by a disdain for bailouts. In reality, the federal government’s actions to shore up the financial system in 2008 were necessary. I think this completely misses the point. One can believe, as I do, that the 2008 bailouts were the lesser of two evils but at the same time criticize the “too big to fail” system of dependency that left the government no option but to execute them.  And that’s what’s hopeful about crypto. We have the prospect of freeing our financial system from dependency on the overly powerful intermediaries that have for too long commandeered an excessive proportion of the economy’s resources and political capital.  To achieve that, we don’t necessarily need to attain some utopian standard of total decentralization. (I find the “gotcha” critiques from the likes of Allen about how crypto’s not as decentralized as the narrative suggests rather tiresome. All the smart people in this space know this.) Rather, we need a system that is sufficiently open to competition and innovation for a significantly wider set of participants than exists in the current system. That means certain elements should be decentralized and “permissionless,” while other parts will require the involvement of trusted parties to achieve appropriate efficiency. What matters is the balance such that every institution is subject to some form of market pressure.  Easy innovation versus hard innovation  And that’s what makes the innovation-by-complexity comparison invalid across both realms. Since banks have a licensed monopoly over monetary creation, a role so vital that it earns them implicit taxpayer protection against losses, the “innovation” they undertake is shaped by very different incentives and checks and balances than that of DeFi developers. Banks had the luxury to develop CDS, CDOs and CDO-squared products to boost leverage and maximize short-term profits without having to calibrate those bets for the risk that the market might turn against them.  By contrast, DeFi developers face a much more fluid and unforgiving market. That’s not only because they don’t have the implicit taxpayer guarantee that banks have but also because of a core design element of DeFi: the open-source “lego” composability of code and low barriers to entry. That design means anyone with sufficient coding knowledge can spin up a new automated market maker, a new governance token or a new stablecoin algorithm without having to ask permission from a government or any other intermediating institution. And that means they can challenge the incumbents.  Consider the story of DeFi over the past two years. First, MakerDAO was the darling of the market, then Compound, then Aave, then Sushi Swap and then hybrid gaming/DeFi services like Axie Infinity, all founded within months of their sudden surge to success. Compare that with the winners that emerged from the rubble of the mortgage crisis: JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. They trace their roots back to 1799 and 1904, respectively.  This DeFi dynamism, if it can be sustained, will prevent the rigidities that Allen worries will breed the same kind of systemic risk that consumed the banking system in the 2000s. That’s because the market is constantly correcting the different winners’ and losers’ tokens. It’s all about the price signals.  Also, while it’s true that DeFi is not perfectly decentralized and that it’s too complicated for the average person, end users of DeFi products have far greater influence over what gets built than do banks’ customers. Not only do many of them hold governance tokens, but with their fickle behavior they produce market signals that keep DeFi developers on their toes, something bankers don’t have to worry about nearly as much.  For sure, risk-taking investors will continue to lose money from rug pulls and code breaches while others will make fortunes. But this hurly-burly is quite different from the systemic problems that beset the financial system in the 2000s, when everyone and every risk asset was winning for a sustained period of years before everyone and everything started massively losing in unison. Most importantly, the constant threat of failure means there’s an incentive for developers to come up with more trustworthy offerings, which is why, despite the horror stories, the system has steadily become more robust over time.  What might threaten this market-driven balance? An ill-thought-out regulatory model. That’s what.  Want to build up systemic risk in DeFi? Then give banks, with their moral hazard-based lending model, an advantage over open-source developers. Make the latter seek permission to obtain the licenses that banks are already privileged to have. Make it very costly for real, market-focused innovation to occur and make short-term exploitative innovation virtually riskless by backing it with government insurance and taxpayer guarantees.  This is not to say centralized service providers in this space shouldn’t be held accountable to laws that preserve financial stability and protect consumers. But as a range of competing proposals for regulating stablecoins, DeFi and the broad crypto industry do battle in Washington, it does mean that we should heed the lessons from the 2008 crisis – the right lessons, not the wrong ones.",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MKR,Michael J.

According to Offchain, the update to Arbitrum will cheapen fees, speed up transactions, and make it easier for native Ethereum apps to interface with the Layer 2 chain.  Offchain founder Steven Goldfeder told CoinDesk that Arbitrum’s fees, which were usually around 50 cents to $1 before the update, will be cut by at least 50%.  Rollups like Arbitrum scale the Ethereum network by processing transactions and executing smart contracts – the mini-computer programs that run on blockchains – on separate rollup-specific chains.  The data generated on Arbitrum gets bundled up and passed back down to Ethereum, where Ethereum network actors can check whether the data is valid.  Last week, a $625 million theft from Ethereum’s Ronin sidechain showed the potential vulnerability of sidechains, which, unlike rollups, do not inherit their security from a layer 1 blockchain.  In March, Offchain also announced Arbitrum AnyTrust chains – a cheaper, faster, more centralized alternative to its optimistic rollup.  Arbitrum is currently Ethereum’s largest rollup solution, with nearly $2.5 billion total value locked (TVL), according to DefiiLlama.

Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Stayed At Elevated Values Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC exchange whale ratio has remained at high values recently. The &apos;exchange whale ratio&apos; is defined as the sum of the top 10 Bitcoin transactions to exchanges divided by the total inflows. In simpler terms, this indicator tells us the relative size of the whale transactions (that is, the ten largest transactions) compared to the total amount of coins moving into exchanges. When the value of this ratio spikes up, it means whales now account for a high percentage of the total exchange inflows. This can be a sign of dumping from these massive holders, and could prove to be bearish for the price of Bitcoin.

However, ZIL is within a bullish breakout pattern and the coin could race back to $0.22 in a buy trend continuation pattern. Past Performance of Zilliqa (ZIL) Technically, buyers are in the driving seat despite the cool-off and retracement from recent highs. After sharp upswings in the last days of Q1 2022, the Zilliqa token price is now pulling back. The coin is stable on the previous trading day but down double digits, shaving 33 percent versus the USDT in the last trading week.

ZIL prices are still trending inside March 30 bull bar with caps at $0.10 and the middle BB to the downside and $0.22 to the upside. Thus far, ZIL is at 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the March 30 to April 1 trade range, sliding horizontally, signaling strength. Therefore, as long as ZIL prices are above $0.10 and the flexible support line of the 20-day moving average holds steady, every pullback could be an opportunity for buyers to load up. The immediate target will be $0.22. On the other hand, deep, high-volume losses below March 30 low may see ZIL drop to $0.08 and $0.06 in the immediate term. What to Expect from ZIL?

Over 19 million bitcoins have been mined as of 2nd April. It simply means there is about 1.9 million Bitcoin left to mine. Bitcoin&apos;s source code, programmed by Satoshi Nakamoto, limits its financial cap to 21 million. Satoshi invented the code to mimic physical gold&apos;s finite supply, making Bitcoin digital gold. Regardless, mining Bitcoin might be a challenging task since the last coin is predicted to be mined in 2140! Even with 19 million coins mined, the majority of the global population cannot afford even a single Bitcoin, and it seems it&apos;s going to get tougher. Recent research from 2021 concludes that about 106 million people use cryptocurrencies and predict an expansion in the blockchain market by over $35 billion. What it Means for Bitcoin&apos;s Price Forecast Considering the fact that about 90.5% of bitcoins have been mined, its price forecast is also set to change. When the supply reaches its maximum, block miners will no longer receive any rewards, thus affecting its market price. The initial reward price had been reduced following the three halving events from 25 BTC to 6.25 BTC. The next halving is set to occur in 2024, and the reward price will reduce even lower.

42394258,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvah8B,1649438984,"Meme Coins, Gambling and Crypto Regulation","The Wall Street Journal on Thursday published a useful dive into meme coin trading. It was pegged to a token called “Will Smith slap inu” that appeared, surged and imploded within a couple of days early last week after the infamous Oscars fracas. “Meme coins” are usually recycled code rebranded to capitalize on this sort of fleeting news cycle. The Journal correctly frames meme coin trading as a high-risk activity with little or no broader social benefit.  First of all, I’m compelled by professional pride to point out that if you’re reading the Journal for crypto coverage, you’re getting the story more than a week late – we warned about Will Smith slap inu and similar meme coins on March 28. Though in fairness, why wouldn’t a story about meme coins be a knockoff?  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Credit where it’s due, the Journal does add some depth to the story, particularly by talking to meme coin traders directly. But the report reaches the same conclusion that we did last month: “Nearly all analysts agree that participation [in meme coin trading] is essentially a form of gambling.”  Meme coin traders who are self-aware about the game they’re playing aim to get in and out at precisely the right times within a window of, in some cases, less than a day. At the end of a memecoin’s rise and nearly inevitable fall, those who have timed their trades right make money and everyone else loses.  As one analyst told the Journal, it’s all a “zero-sum game,” in which wealth is merely transferred between participants. No wealth can be created because meme coins offer no innovation and have no real utility (this gets more complicated in cases like the shiba inu [SHIB] coin, where a formerly meme-based community at least appears to be building actual features).  On the spectrum of crypto assets, these are the real garbage. That simplicity makes them quite useful for thinking about crypto and financial regulation. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday laid out the Biden administration agenda on crypto, broadly stating that rules for the new technology should be similar to those for the traditional financial system, including prioritizing protecting investors from fraud.  As much as knowledgeable crypto insiders may be tempted to laugh at meme coins as a funny and marginal quirk of the space, most are unambiguously frauds and they’re costing people money based on implicit or explicit deception. Not everyone who buys a meme coin knows that they’ve really bought a ticket for a time-limited, augmented-reality casino that can wipe them out faster than they can blink.  See also: Investing in Meme Coins? 3 Things Every Crypto Trader Needs to Know | Learn  Those with even the slightest bit of insight may find it hard to believe anyone would genuinely think “Will Smith inu” was a buy-and-hodl asset, but the human experience is a rich and varied tapestry. Some people in that tapestry are more frayed around the edges than others – more vulnerable, more desperate, less educated. It’s their money that ends up in the hands of meme coin creators, and of lucky and savvy meme coin traders.  Low-hanging fruit  So the question becomes, do we as a society have an obligation to protect people from their own urge to gamble? On the face of it, “no” seems like a compelling answer for a couple of reasons. First, because freedom and bald eagles and semiautomatic handguns. I feel strongly I should be able to engage in reckless speculation if that’s what I want, because this is America.  Second, and more substantively, a truly free market in small-dollar frauds is also a potentially amazing educational experience for millions of people. Losing money really has a way of sharpening the critical mind, or at least attuning people to their own appropriate level of risk. On a longer timespan, an unregulated market populated with this type of investor ­– once-burnt but now well-informed and risk-conscious – would produce stronger macroeconomic outcomes than one reliant on a central regulator to warn against bad bets.  Unfortunately, that’s an unrealistic vision: Even supposedly sophisticated “accredited investors” with access to less-regulated traditional finance markets like private equity and hedge funds get taken to the cleaners by cheap-suit con men all the time. A clear-eyed analysis would admit that unregulated securities markets, particularly markets in which there’s no control of asset issuance or punishment for misrepresentation of assets, is going to be rife with what amounts to theft disguised as speculation.  Further, this is about more than individual losses by the uninformed or unlucky – there are also broader social effects to consider. By way of analogy, we already know that traditional gambling not only has devastating effects for individuals with addiction issues but can harm society as a whole. Research increasingly indicates that higher levels of gambling lead to worse public health and other damage at the population level because problem gambler behavior and losses harm family and community, not just themselves.  Meme coin trading seems likely to be implicated in similar harms. That would make cracking down on them a question of social impacts, not just individual freedoms.  Meme coins are a relatively easy problem to tackle as the U.S. continues developing its crypto regulation approach. There are some issues in crypto that will require new rules and clarifications, such as whether miners are financial agents. But issuing a security and promoting it under false premises is already illegal, and pursuing issuers using existing rules is exactly the sort of “technology neutral” approach Yellen has argued for.  See also: How Crypto's Regulatory Scene Might Evolve in 2022 | Opinion  What’s key here is that the emphasis be on enforcement rather than new technological restrictions, surveillance or other forms of prior restraint. That’s important to protect real innovation.  But there’s no coherent argument to be made that overt fraud helps improve the crypto industry, or society as a whole. Finding and punishing the issuers of manipulative meme coins like Will Smith slap inu might not always be easy, but it’s exactly the sort of low-hanging fruit regulators would focus on if they really wanted to protect average speculators.",NEGATIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SHIB | TRADING,David Z.

On the positive side, the crypto derivatives and non-fungible token businesses continue to build. Goldman maintained its buy recommendation on Coinbase’s stock.

Through the partnership, central banks that are trialing or launching CBDCs will be able to use the Celo blockchain to allow end users access to decentralized finance (DeFi) products, according to a press release.  The Celo blockchain allows native and non-native digital assets (cryptographic and CBDCs) to circulate freely across devices, carriers and countries, according to the Celo website. The blockchain uses phone numbers for public keys and issues a native stable-value token.  ECurrency enables central banks to mint and issue CBDC instruments to financial intermediaries in compliance with existing legal frameworks. In 2021, eCurrency worked with the Bank of Jamaica on the pilot of the Jamaican CBDC (the Jam-Dex). The Ireland-based firm uses digital symmetric cryptography technology for central banks to issue and distribute CBDCs securely and efficiently, according to its website.  “After seeing how Celo has opened new opportunities for end users, such as access to loans and savings, it’s only natural that cLabs extend the use case to CBDCs,” said Tim Moreton, chief executive of cLabs, in the release.  The Celo Foundation announced ""Connect the World,"" at its conference earlier in the week in Barcelona, a $20 million campaign to incentivize the development of high-quality Celo on- and off-ramps worldwide.

The Avalon 1266 will have 100 terahash per second (TH/s) mining hashrate capacity and 35 joules per terahash (J/T) power efficiency, a company executive said during the Bitcoin 2022 Conference in Miami. The new model improves upon the previous Avalon 1246, which had capacity of 90 TH/s and 38 J/T efficiency.  Compared with Bitmain’s non-liquid cooled miners, Canaan’s new model specs out between the S19 (95 TH/s, 34.5 J/T) and the S19 pro (110 TH/s 29.5 J/T). Bitmain’s newest offering, the Antminer S19 XP Hyd. with liquid cooling technology, however, boasts 255 TH/s of computing power at efficiency of 20.8 J/T.  Rig manufacturer MicroBT also unveiled a product at the Miami conference – the WhatsMiner M50S with 126 TH/s of computing power and 26 J/T efficiency, coming ahead of Canaan’s new offering.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Canaan Senior Vice President Edward Lu said the new mining machine’s value proposition is its durability. “If you buy our machines, you can use them for a lifetime … You don't have to change your machine or replace them every year.”  “A good miner has to withstand not only the long shipment journeys, but also the diverse operating environments in which it will be deployed in,” he added.  In addition, Lu said, Canaan is setting up mining service centers globally so customers can get faster support for their miners. This new machine and subsequent models, he said, can also be used both with air cooling as well as immersion cooling for heat management.  Pricing for the Avalon 1266 was not yet disclosed.  Speedy market growth expected  Canaan expects the ASICs market to grow faster than ever before as customers and manufacturers are becoming more professional and additional key players are joining the industry.  “The market is growing more and more professional now and with some other international key players coming into the market,” Lu said. “I believe this market really has a potential to grow and develop further.”  To that point, chipmaker giant Intel (INTC) recently unveiled its second-generation mining chip, which boasts efficiency up to 26 J/T and is highly customizable for enhanced mining power. Canaan’s Lu views Intel’s entry into the market as a positive catalyst, which will help the industry become more competitive and help grow faster.  “Previously this industry used to be somewhat mysterious. Now, with big companies coming into the market, it is a proof that the industry has potential to grow,” he said, adding that large companies like Intel don't get into small industries unless there’s sizable potential for growth.  Another aspect of players like Intel coming into the industry, said Lu, is it will make the ASIC manufacturing market more competitive and will incentivize the incumbents to invest additional sums. “I think with Intel's coming in, Canaan and all the other peers in this industry should be well prepared for such competition, in terms of technologies and in terms of services,” he said. “I think that Intel coming in will really help improve the industry.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/08/canaan-unveils-new-bitcoin-mining-machine-as-it-sees-speedier-asic-market-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bff0d55ed326346969a5dc86d8d7ecd95b33ffd8-512x512.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

So, lesson learned, we’re taking full responsibility for this internally.”  Teams across the cryptocurrency industry are launching projects and platforms that, at inception, are relatively centralized. They often say they'll ""progressively decentralize"" as they build users and evolve their technology.  To accommodate more transactions, Sky Mavis moved from the decentralized Ethereum network to the cheaper, faster, but more centralized Ronin network – where only a handful of validators (overseen by Sky Mavis itself) were responsible for authenticating the network. It was connected to Ethereum by a “bridge,” or arrangement whereby tokens on one chain are tied up in a smart contract while proxies for them move freely on the other.  Larsen acknowledged Friday that his own team’s path towards ""progressive decentralization"" might not have gone far enough, quickly enough – leaving users vulnerable as a result.  ""We're the team that pushed to go down this path of, you know, progressive decentralization and, and all those trade-offs made us vulnerable for this attack,” he said.  Preventive measures  To prevent further exploits, Sky Mavis is adding more validators to Ronin. Previously, five out of nine validators were required to sign off on Ronin transactions; now the network requires 10 out of 11.  It took Sky Mavis six days to figure out the attack was happening. Now, Larsen said, the company is looking at a circuit breaker system, which will aim to monitor if too much money is being withdrawn from the Ronin network at one specific time. If that occurs, validators will shut down the bridge in order to verify the transaction.  Larsen said that the team is replacing the money stolen from the bridge and raising outside funds, noting that although the ethos of crypto is that the space is dangerous, “users shouldn’t lose their funds in a situation like this, it’s our responsibility.”  Read more:Sky Mavis Raises $150M Round Led by Binance to Reimburse Ronin Attack Victims  Parts of the Axie Infinity Treasury now are being collateralized, which means that if money from the hack is recovered, it will be placed back into the Axie Infinity treasury over time.  There are about 1.5 million players of the original Axie Infinity game, released two years ago. Axie Origin, a new game on the network, incorporated 300,000 testers, or unique players, on Thursday, giving them early access, Larsen said. The players came in without any token incentives or any way to play on mobile.  “I think this will be something the industry will grow from,” Larsen said of the hack, describing the experience as a “nightmare.”  “We have to face the music here, and that’s exactly what we did,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,AXS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/08/axie-infinity-builder-takes-full-responsibility-for-625m-ronin-hack-exec-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/129892726be86808488dd83ed6ac1db47010c0fe-1440x806.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Building things is a better solution than arguing about things,"" Back said, explaining that the pilot is meant to show that bitcoin (BTC) mining can fund renewable energy installations and innovation.  Dorsey's Block (then called Square) teased the deal last June when it announced it would invest $5 million in a solar-powered mine built in partnership with Blockstream  This development's cost of $12 million will be split evenly between Blockstream and Block, and is expected to be up and running in a few months. The mine will have a relatively tiny 30 petahash/second in computing power and energy capacity of just 1 megawatt (MW).  Real-time operational and financial information about the mine, including its energy consumption and hashrate, will be publicly available in a dashboard, Back said. The data is intended to inform the public debate around off-grid mining and whether it can fund the expansion of solar power. ""When people publish just analyst reports, and articles, and blog posts, and data, they are all suspicious. But if we publish the raw data, the raw financial information, I think it speaks for itself,"" Back said.  The project will be completely off-grid, said Back, with a Tesla 3.8 MW solar array powering the mine, and 12-megawatt-hour (MWh) Tesla batteries storing excess electricity produced during the day so that the mine can run at night and on days without sunshine.  Bitcoin mining has been under continual attack for its alleged carbon footprint. Last week, Greenpeace, Environmental Working Group, and Ripple's Chris Larsen launched a campaign to change its fundamental model away from proof-of-work, which requires a lot of energy to run.  ""Bitcoin is not the question, bitcoin is the answer,"" said Back, as it can act as a baseload consumer of electricity, making renewable energy projects financially viable, and enabling further investment in renewable energy assets.

42395603,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDPP,1649431759,Top US Bank Watchdog Warns of Stablecoins' 'Lack of Interoperability',"The wildly different approaches the crypto industry has taken to designing and hosting stablecoins may be good for innovation but bad for practical and safe usage, argued Michael Hsu, the acting chief of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, at a Georgetown University Law Center event on Friday.  Hsu, who is among several U.S. regulators working on guardrails for how stablecoins should be overseen, noted that a single type of token, such as tether (USDT), isn’t the same across different blockchains, nor is it directly exchangeable with other dollar-based tokens. If private stablecoins ever become a common means of buying and selling things – rather than trading other cryptocurrencies – Hsu said they can’t be freely swapped with each other, in contrast to a dollar deposited at institutions such as Chase or Wells Fargo.  “Without interoperability amongst [U.S. dollar]-based stablecoins, the risk of digital ecosystems being fragmented and exclusive – with walled gardens – is heightened,” Hsu argued. “If or when stablecoins expand from trading to payments, this lack of interoperability will become more apparent.”  He said he also worries about these financial gardens excluding people.  “What’s the standard-setting body for interoperability on stablecoins? There is none right now,” he said. “So I would encourage some thinking along those lines and having a public voice at that table.”  An evolving position  Though Hsu been an outspoken critic in the past of crypto’s potential hazards, equating the industry with the risky financial products that caused the financial system to collapse in 2008, his latest remarks reveal he’s not entirely dismissing the industry. As Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did in her first speech on digital assets Thursday, Hsu granted that digital-asset innovations may dramatically revolutionize the system.  “Today, cryptocurrencies are used primarily for trading on exchanges,” he said. “Tomorrow, they may collapse and exist only on the shadowy peripheries of the financial system, or they may grow and power the next evolution of our digital lives and the digital economy.”  Much of the bandwidth of federal financial regulators is now taken up by crypto issues, as has been seen this week in the speeches of Yellen, Hsu and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. While Gensler’s SEC has been actively chasing enforcement actions to rein in crypto firms, Hsu’s predecessors at the OCC had in recent years attempted to welcome digital-assets businesses into the banking system.  Shortly after Hsu took over the OCC last May, however, he slammed the brakes on much of that while the agency works out what to do about stablecoins and other assets.  Hsu noted on Friday that there are some technical pitfalls in marrying banking and crypto, including dangers to a lender’s liquidity cushion if they’re immersed in large-scale cryptocurrency transactions.  “The accumulation of blockchain-based payments over, say, a weekend could outstrip a bank’s available liquidity resources,” he said. Hsu suggested the answer could be to silo such activity into a separate, bank-chartered part of the company.  Hsu said he’s also been impressed with some of the “really thoughtful” legislative efforts trying to address stablecoins.

42395606,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDMS,1649429397,DeFi Giant Yearn Leads the Way on ERC-4626 Token Standard Adoption,"Yearn Finance, a vault-based, decentralized yield aggregation platform, has become the first major protocol to publicly support the adoption of ERC-4626, providing a level of legitimacy and encouragement for others in the space to start exploring the usage of ERC-4626.  Yearn’s endorsement on Twitter is a “big deal,” according to ERC-4626 co-author and Ape Framework builder, Señor Doggo, because it signals to other larger and more established teams that ERC-4626 is worth looking into.  ERC-4626 is a new Ethereum token standard aimed at streamlining the different design types of tokens that print money, aka yield-bearing tokens.  The novel standard was finalized last month and has already garnered use from some of decentralized finance's (DeFi) largest players – perhaps an indication of the speed and innovation happening within the Ethereum ecosystem as the network gears up for its proof-of-stake upgrade called “the Merge.""  Before the introduction of ERC-4626, “the tokenized vault standard,” DeFi developers commonly wrote unique coding solutions to integrate yield-bearing tokens and spent their own money or the project’s to audit that custom-made code for potential security vulnerabilities.  According to Fei Protocol founder and co-author of ERC-4626, Joey Santoro, this was a massive headache for developers. The lack of standardization for yield-bearing tokens allowed inefficiencies and insecurities to propagate across DeFi.  DeFi, as a growing subsector with $120.59 billion in total locked value on the Ethereum blockchain, enables people to have access to financial services and yield generation without the need of a traditional middleman.  See also: Understanding DeFi and Its Importance in the Crypto Economy  Yield-bearing tokens, like Aave’s aToken, Compound’s cToken or Sushi’s xToken, are essential elements in DeFi because they represent a person’s share of yield-generating activity on a DeFi protocol.  Now is different  ERC-4626 not only standardizes yield-bearing tokens to make them easier to build with, but it also creates a shared interface for tokens held in vaults, or smart contracts that draw liquidity from deposits of asset tokens for yield farming strategies.  Santoro clarified that the novel standard essentially applies to any place where a user puts a single token in and gets a single token out.  Moreover, developers don’t have to write new code to create custom vaults for every single new DeFi application.  Any application built on top of an ERC-4626 vault will work for any ERC-4626 token – much like building for ERC-20 tokens, the standard that launched the infamous initial coin offering boom in 2017.  With improved composability, DeFi developers think this could open a new wave of financial innovation in the sector.  Yearn leads  Yearn, one of the largest DeFi stakeholders, said on Twitter Tuesday, “the Great Vault Standardization begins now” as “ERC-4626 will be the gold standard for any sort of interest-bearing token.”  According to Santoro, Yearn’s announcement on Twitter was its way of “putting their flag in the ground and saying we’re going to drive adoption of this standard.”  He predicts ERC-4626 will become ubiquitous in part because Yearn will drive adoption even if protocols don’t adopt ERC-4626.  Let’s say other major DeFi applications like Aave and Compound decide not to build on ERC-4626; Yearn can still generate a wrapper contract in which a developer can create another token that would wrap Aave and Compound’s yield-bearing token, making it compatible with the standard.  In this light, Yearn can force adoption in a backward compatible way by creating these wrapper vaults.  Or as Yearn said,“Yearn V3 + ERC-4626 = INEVITABLE.”  In use  Santoro indicated that it makes sense for future developers to just build directly with the standard because wrapping requires extra gas and steps.  Regardless, ERC-4626 is a game changer for DeFi developers contributing to various lending markets, yield aggregators and intrinsically interest-bearing tokens.  See also: ERC-4626: DeFi's Newest Money Lego  Indeed, developers from across the DeFi ecosystem, not just Yearn, are already building on ERC-4626, Santoro said. The standard, first proposed in January and finalized in March, is now being implemented by the likes of Alchemix, Balancer, Rari Capital, Fei Protocol and Open Zeppelin.  While there have been reports indicating that ERC-4626 is set to be implemented at the next Ethereum fork upgrade, these reports are a misconception, according to Santoro and Señor Doggo. The standard is final, and people are already using it.  It is up to the developers to implement the new standard on their own time, as ERC-4626 does not require a hard fork.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | YFI | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,Sage D.

42411814,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgCyt,1649428687,DeFi Analytics: How to Use Data to Make Smarter Investment Decisions,"Sourcing high-quality information is crucial when investing in decentralized finance (DeFi). This can be anything from identifying the daily trading volume of a particular token to finding the best yield rates across various platforms.  Without the correct data, you’re entirely dependent on luck, and investing becomes more like gambling. But how do you obtain reputable and accurate data?  Tracking DeFi data  When it comes to finding data related to account balances, how many investors are in or out of the money or how much volume is being moved on or off exchanges, there are a number of different tools available that pull information directly from public DeFi blockchains to provide these insights.  Since all data recorded on public blockchains is immutable, transparent and verified, it’s considered extremely accurate.  Blockchain explorers  Blockchain explorers, sites that publish the data of a blockchain’s entire ledger, are a great source of information. For Ethereum, try Etherscan, and consider BscScan for the Binance Smart Chain. These sites let you interact directly with a blockchain’s smart contract, bypassing any front-end user interface.  These will allow you to see things such as how many individual addresses hold significant portions of a particular token and how active those wallets are. These important insights, among others, can then be used to make educated investment decisions.  DeFi dashboards and wallet trackers  While blockchain explorers are great sources of data, they can often be difficult to navigate and understand, particularly if you’re a new crypto user.  If you want accurate and granular on-chain analytics without the headache, you might want to head to sites like CoinMetrics, Skew or Glassnode. These sites provide reliable metrics about the cryptocurrency market, including accurate data for derivatives, in a way that’s more accessible to beginner-level investors.  If you want to drill deep into specific wallets or tokens, Nansen’s ""token god"" mode lets you analyze any token, and its ""wallet profiler"" lets you follow top-performing wallets.  Dune Analytics has become a vital venue for dashboards about the latest DeFi projects. The community-created dashboards, which may include, for example, data about OpenSea trading data, gas fee analytics and Curve Finance user counts, are useful when trying to understand the crypto market. However, it’s important to note that because these are created by members of the community, there is potential for the data to be inaccurate, so it’s best not to rely wholly on them for your data needs.  Tracking wallets and NFT trades  Sites like CryptoSlam! have become popular venues for non-fungible token (NFT) tracking. CryptoSlam! is geared towards NFT trades and lets you track the top-performing collections. Sites like Context and Nansen let you track top-performing wallets, while Lucky Trader and rarity.tools provide information about an NFT’s metadata, such as how rare a pair of sunglasses on a Bored Ape might be.  Assessing the size of the decentralized finance market  When investing in DeFi, another thing you’ll need to do is assess the size of the market of whatever it is you’re planning on buying into. There are two main metrics for this, but it’s important to note that each comes with its limitations and caveats. This means they’re not necessarily as reliable as the above-mentioned options and should be used more as an approximate gauge than an accurate data point.  Calculating a DeFi token’s market cap  The first metric is the market capitalization of a particular DeFi coin. This is a crude multiplication of all the coins in circulation by the most recent price of a coin. Most price aggregation sites – those that calculate the average price of a cryptocurrency by scraping prices from different exchanges – have devoted DeFi categories: Here’s CoinMarketCap’s, and here’s CoinGecko’s.  The market caps of the entire DeFi market diverge greatly between the two price aggregation sites. CoinGecko pegs DeFi’s market cap at $146 billion and CoinMarketcap lists it as $165 billion (at press time.) The discrepancy can partly be chalked up to differences in what constitutes a DeFi coin. CoinGecko’s page also only lists the top 100 DeFi coins, while CoinMarketCap includes 537 different projects in its calculation.  The market capitalization of a specific coin is usually fairly consistent across price aggregation sites, and any discrepancies may be due to the exchanges the aggregation site includes in its price calculator and the accuracy of its circulating supply. However, remember that the market cap includes inaccessible coins, like those held in wallets to which the keys have long been lost, thereby making market caps slightly unreliable.  Calculating the total value locked (TVL)  Another important metric is ""total value locked,"" or TVL. This refers to how much cryptocurrency is locked up within a certain DeFi protocol – usually those staked to earn yields. For investors that are largely uninterested in speculating on a DeFi token’s value, TVL is a useful indicator for gauging how popular a DeFi protocol’s financial services are.  Many sites attempt to calculate the TVL of various platforms. Leading ones include:  DeFi Pulse.  DeFi Llama.  DappRadar.  Again, you will observe that the TVLs reported on these sites are also very different. At press time, DeFi Llama, for instance, lists stablecoin-friendly DEX Curve as having a TVL of $21.2 billion, while DeFi Pulse records a TVL of $10.53 billion – about half that.  Head to a DeFi protocol’s site and you will often find the figure they display is also entirely different.  DeFi lending protocol Compound says that about $10 billion worth of crypto is currently earning interest in its smart contracts, while DeFi Pulse lists it with a TVL of $6.5 billion, and DeFi Llama says Compound has around $6.85 billion locked in its protocol.  That’s because the sites calculate TVLs in different ways, sometimes choosing to, for instance, avoid ""double counting"" borrowed and issued loans. Each statistic, therefore, tells a different story – you’ll have to dig into each specific computation to work out if you’re getting the data you want.  Whichever you choose to use, the thing that matters most is using the same TVL data source consistently. If you mix and match TVLs from different sources you might find yourself in a muddle when it comes to deciding whether or not you should get involved with a particular project.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/defi-analytics-how-to-use-data-to-make-smarter-investment-decisions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b25d041953295cf082f6faa2b1ddb35b8b9364d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin eyes weekly loss, and next week's U.S. inflation data could bring more selling pressure to the market.  Featured Story: A censorship-resistant inflation index is being built on Chainlink.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Aleksander Larsen, co-founder and COO, Sky Mavis  Don Kaufman, co-founder, TheoTrade  Chen Arad, chief operating officer, Solidus Labs  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Macroeconomic fears resurfaced this week, putting pressure on risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC). The top cryptocurrency traded at $43,300 at press time, representing a 6% drop for the week.  The minutes of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) March meeting released Wednesday revealed that policymakers plan to trim the Fed's almost $9 trillion portfolio by up to $95 billion each month. At that pace, the Fed would need four years to shrink the balance sheet to the pre-pandemic level. Many Fed officials said they were prepared to raise interest rates in half-percentage point increments in upcoming meetings to control inflation – a far-steeper pace of monetary tightening than the usual quarter-point hikes.  That puts the focus squarely on the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for March, due for release on Tuesday. The data is expected to show the cost of living in the world's largest economy rose to an annualized 8.3% in March versus 7.9% in February, according to Dailyfx.  One narrative is that an extra hawkish campaign by the Fed is already priced in and that a high CPI figure could be a non-event. (Whether the Fed will be able to walk the talk is a topic of discussion for another day). The Fed minutes are backward-looking, meaning they tell us what policymakers were thinking in mid-March, before the impending CPI release.  Therefore, an above-8% CPI print, the first since 1982, could see investors reassess the pace of the Fed's tightening, injecting volatility into bonds and risk assets.  A big miss on CPI could temporarily restore the risk-on sentiment. However, a massive scaling back of rate hike bets would require consecutive weak inflation prints. But, that's unlikely, as per some experts.  ""Higher inflation has become increasingly broad-based. Since the start of 2021, the share of items in the consumption basket that have seen very large price rises has increased steadily,"" the Bank for International Settlements said in a note published on April 5. ""In particular, growth in services has accelerated. Because growth in service prices tends to be more persistent than that in goods, inflation may be becoming more entrenched.""  Lastly, bitcoin's rising correlation with equities means it could underperform traditional store of value assets like gold in the coming months. The yellow metal and oil outperformed the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, by significant margins during previous periods of stagflation.  History could repeat itself, drawing investors away from equities, especially tech stocks and toward energy. Analysts at JPMorgan foresee a 40% rally in commodities in the coming months.  ""In the current juncture, where the need for inflation hedges is more elevated, it is conceivable to see longer-term commodity allocations eventually rising above 1% of total financial assets globally, surpassing the previous highs,” the JPMorgan strategists wrote in an April 6 note. All else being equal, that “would imply another 30% to 40% upside for commodities from here,” they said, according to Bloomberg.

Think of it as a competitor to the consumer price index (CPI), and one where officials can’t move the goalposts.  “The framework that [the government] is using is a hundred years old … and they have continuously tried to evolve that versus taking a fresh approach in an age where we’ve got everything computerized,” Truflation founder Stefan Rust told CoinDesk in an interview.  The team started building Truflation after former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan challenged Web 3 developers to build a censorship-resistant inflation feed, claiming that “the centralized state isn’t going to provide reliable inflation stats,” and promising an investment of $100,000.

42395616,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDYG,1649424516,Ethereum Gas Usage Rose in March as Ether Ran to $3.5K,"Gas usage on Ethereum was up 13% in March from the previous month amid greater demand for block space, according to DeFi analytics firm HashEx in a note shared with CoinDesk.  That gas demand, said some market observers, played a role in pushing ether (ETH) above $3,500.  Some of the demand came from higher ERC-20 token generation and the rise of layer 2 applications, HashEx's research found. Layer 2 refers to protocols that operate atop the Ethereum network, such as Arbitrum and Optimism.  Gas refers to the amount of ether – the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum – required for a user to interact with the network.  The gas fee varies and is determined by the miners depending on factors such as supply and demand, the need for computing power to process smart contracts, the total number of transactions and the overall complexity of calculations when performing smart contract functions.  Gas demand grows with ether prices  Ether prices reached over $3,500 in March alongside the rise in gas usage, breaking above the $2,300-$3,200 range seen in February. Other catalysts for that run were a recovery in bitcoin (BTC) prices – which led to a broader crypto market bounce – and a successful testnet merge ahead of Ethereum’s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus design.  Some analysts pointed out that high gas usage is a fundamentally positive sign, regardless of what ether prices do.  “Ethereum gas usage has increased in recent weeks,” noted Adam O'Neill, chief marketing officer at crypto exchange Bitrue in a Telegram message. “This proves the high demand for Ethereum block space even as the market endures a bearish trend.”  Johnny Lyu, CEO of crypto exchange KuCoin, shared the sentiment: “Gas demand will grow along with the expansion of applications of the Ethereum blockchain, which will also increase the demand for ETH. This is a very typical supply-and-demand relationship.”  “Investors entered the accumulation stage from the second week of March and are watching the rise in prices of cryptocurrencies, so the cost of transactions at the end of March did not reach record levels; instead, only a correlation with the cost of Ethereum could be observed,” Lyu added in an email to CoinDesk.  Some of this demand came from token generation, which was roughly 125% above February's levels.

42395612,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDVJ,1649421000,A Censorship-Resistant Inflation Index Is Being Built on Chainlink,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) firm Truflation is building a new gauge to track inflation independent from the government and in real-time. Think of it as a competitor to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and one where officials can’t move the goalposts.  “The framework that [the government] is using is a hundred years old … and they have continuously tried to evolve that versus taking a fresh approach in an age where we’ve got everything computerized,” Truflation founder Stefan Rust told CoinDesk in an interview.  The team started building Truflation after former Coinbase (COIN) Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan challenged Web 3 developers to build a censorship-resistant inflation feed, claiming that “the centralized state isn’t going to provide reliable inflation stats,” and promising an investment of $100,000.  On Friday it was announced that Truflation won the challenge.  The key difference between the CPI and the Truflation index is that while the government uses survey data to measure inflation, Truflation looks at price data. The CPI is measured in the form of a survey that collects about 94,000 prices per month for commodities and services and 8,000 rental housing units for the housing component.  “It’s the black box. We don’t know how they made the survey, how they executed it and so on … and the surveys are quite dubious to us as opposed to real price data of the sales point that you can get from real merchants or aggregators,” Rust said.  While the Truflation index is based on the same calculation model as the widely used CPI, it is different because it measures and reports inflation changes daily by using current real-market price data from sources like Zillow, Penn State and Nielsen, among others.  About 40% of the data that is being looked at is the same goods basket that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses. The remaining 60% is being substituted with data from other sources.  Truflation, which runs on Chainlink and is therefore accessible and visible for everyone, currently measures a 13.2% inflation rate, as opposed to 7.9% measured by the CPI in March.  Caused partly by the COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain difficulties and governments’ response to those issues, inflation is a hot topic again among policymakers, traders and everyday people.  For decades, the Federal Reserve has used the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) to track and compare how much prices have risen but some people are skeptical about the reliability of those figures, arguing that some important data points aren’t included and that there is a variance within the average basket of goods that is not taken into account.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/08/a-censorship-resistant-inflation-index-is-being-built-on-chainlink,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5531d751a84c9539fdf689f92323f0915638cda3-4000x2666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395610,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDUK,1649415625,NEAR Token Has Doubled in 4 Weeks; Here's Why,"NEAR, the cryptocurrency powering layer 1 blockchain Near, has entered the crypto market's historically bullish second quarter with a bang.  The token has doubled to $20 in four weeks, significantly outperforming major coins: bitcoin gained 15% and ether 30% in the same period. Furthermore, NEAR tops the list of biggest gainers with market values of at least $1 billion, according to data source Messari.  Experts said several developments, including the flood of venture capital (VC) money into the Near protocol, appear to have revved up interest in the cryptocurrency.  VC boost  ""Recent funding rounds show VCs have high conviction in the blockchain,"" CK Cheung, an investment analyst at DeFiance Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Earlier this week, the protocol raised $350 million in a round led by hedge fund Tiger Global to accelerate the decentralization of the NEAR ecosystem. In January, Near raised $150 million from major crypto investment firms. Last month, Trisolaris, a decentralized exchange on the Near protocol, announced a strategic investment worth $4.5 million from Electric Capital with participation from Jump Crypto, Dragonfly Capital, Leminscap and Ethereal Ventures.  The protocol, created by former Microsoft (MSFT) employee Alexander Skidanov and developer Ilya Polosukhin, is a decentralized programmable blockchain that uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. In December, it introduced sharding to boost transaction capacity and speeds and to lower overall costs.  ""NEAR has built technology to enable transactions that are fast (~1 second), quick to finality (~1-2 seconds), cheap (less than a penny), and secure,"" Messari's Tom Dunleavy said in a research post published last month.  So, Near appears ahead of Ethereum, the world's largest smart-contract blockchain, which has yet to complete its transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism. ""NEAR seems like the Ethereum 2 roadmap implemented,"" angel investor Naval Ravikant said during a discussion about layer 1, or base, protocols in January.  Heavyweight buyers  According to Rudy Chen, an analyst at crypto ratings firm TokenInsight, NEAR is one of the most sought-after tokens.  ""NEAR's rally has several reasons. First, the gushing VC money and, second, many key opinion leaders and influencers are holding NEAR right now and tweeting about the same,"" Chen said.  ""Time for the big reveal ... DCG's new third-largest crypto holding is ... NEAR,"" Barry Silbert, co-founder and CEO of CoinDesk's parent company Digital Currency Group tweeted Thursday. Messari's research shows NEAR was one of the most commonly owned crypto assets in fourth-quarter 2021.  According to Zoran Kole, founder of popular Telegram group Crypto Insiders, Near's developer growth statistics are equally impressive. ""They have one of the fastest growing ecosystems with a 4x growth of total developers over the last two years. This high developer growth rate is a key indicator that adoption and usage of the protocol will continue into the near future,"" Kole wrote in a blog post published Thursday.  Stablecoin speculation  Talk about the impending launch on the protocol of a stablecoin offering a double-digit annual percentage yield (APY) could also be driving investor interest in the cryptocurrency, Chen added.  On Thursday, Crypto Insiders' Kole revealed April 20 as the possible launch date of the algorithmic stablecoin called USN. The high yield will rival the near 20% APY offered by programmable blockchain Terra's dollar-pegged stablecoin UST and would be one of the highest in the industry.  ""They will offer an extremely attractive ~20% APR [annual percentage rate], which will ignite DeFi capital rotation into the Near ecosystem, siphoning the total value locked from other alternative layer-one protocols,"" Kole said in a Substack post. ""This will lead to a comparison of Near to Terra (LUNA) as the narrative for attractive stablecoin yields proliferates.""  Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies with values fixed to an external reference like the U.S. dollar, help users avoid the price volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins have become the flavor of the season, thanks to Luna Foundation Guard's decision to accumulate bitcoin as reserve for UST. Frax announced a similar move early Friday.",POSITIVE,LUNA | NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MARKET | NEAR | TOKEN SALE,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/08/near-token-has-doubled-in-4-weeks-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1a7db19b1d1c895f5ac2882e217e4de7dba5472-1920x1070.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Quant is $26.86 Million, marking a 40.17% rise. Past Performance of QNT QNT coin price fails to surpass the increased supply met near the 100-day EMA resulting in the retracement to the support trendline with the 18% fall last week.

Source-Tradingview QNT Technical Analysis QNT coin price action reflects the bullish reversal opportunity in the triangle, but the 50-day EMA provides an internal resistance. Moreover, the reversal lacks the commitment for a bullish breakout compared to the supply-rich 100-day EMA. The QNT price trades below all the crucial EMAs with the significant spread between the bearish aligned in the daily chart. Hence, the EMAs act as extra resistances suppressing the bullish triangle breakout possibility.

42395604,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDNR,1649413800,Cosmos-Based Gravity DEX Rebrands and Moves Chains,"With more money flowing into the inter-blockchain Cosmos network, multiple players are jostling to position themselves as the ecosystem’s premier destination for decentralized finance (DeFi).  Against this backdrop, Gravity DEX, a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol on the Cosmos Hub blockchain, is re-launching as Crescent (CRE) and moving to a new Cosmos-based blockchain of the same name, according to B-Harvest, the project’s developer.  Along with rebranding to Crescent and moving to the eponymous Crescent network, B-Harvest plans to flesh out the platform with a suite of new features, including tools for lending and borrowing across blockchains, and a new order book DEX model.  What it means  B-Harvest made a name for itself as one of the earliest validators for the proof-of-stake Cosmos Hub blockchain. Cosmos Hub was the first blockchain to launch on the Cosmos ecosystem – a family of blockchains that serve different use-cases and are purpose-built to interoperate.  Gravity DEX was B-Harvest’s attempt to carve out a larger role for itself within Cosmos’s growing DeFi ecosystem. The Gravity DEX protocol currently powers Cosmos Hub’s Emeris DeFi platform, which launched in beta in the summer of 2021 and at press time has less than $5 million locked in liquidity pools, according to its dashboards.  Ignite (formerly Tendermint), the company behind Emeris, acquired B-Harvest last year and told CoinDesk it plans to build out support for Crescent after it launches on April 14.  Gravity, B-Harvest’s legacy protocol, will remain operational once Crescent launches, but Crescent will offer users farming rewards to entice them to migrate their liquidity over to the new protocol.  Cosmos DeFi  Crescent and Emeris seek to position themselves as the leading DeFi destination within the Cosmos ecosystem, but Gravity DEX (and Emeris) have thus far struggled to attract the same kind of interest as Osmosis (OSMO), another Cosmos-based DEX that has $1.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama.  B-Harvest CEO Hyung Yeon Lee told CoinDesk that building Crescent on a new blockchain – rather than the more “conservative” Cosmos Hub – will enable the team to build out more “innovative” features, like an order book exchange and cross-chain lending, which will, in theory, position the project to bite off a larger portion of the Cosmos DeFi pie.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MINING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/08/cosmos-based-gravity-dex-rebrands-and-moves-chains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fd0cd7cdcb1ec8f66e3450a516c72c37a3e2a91-4096x2733.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The central bank has also raised the alarm over ""training events"" that are used to push and sell crypto services to retail customers, according to BAS.  BAS based its recommendations on a March 30 meeting with MAS, at which the Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Enterprises and Start-ups Singapore (Access) and Singapore FinTech Association (SFA), were also present, according to the report.

42395602,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASyDLT,1649407217,"Frax Stablecoin Backing to Feature Layer 1 Tokens, Real-World Loans","Algorithmic stablecoin platform Frax Finance plans to expand the basket of assets that back its FRAX stablecoin by adding other cryptocurrencies, interest-generating tokens and traditional asset loans to the mix.  The Frax protocol is a two-token system comprising the stablecoin and a governance token, Frax shares (FXS). FRAX maintains a peg to the U.S. dollar by being partially collateralized by USD coin (USDC) alongside periodically buying and selling FXS to maintain its market capitalization.  That is set to change.  ""FRAX plans to buy native tokens of layer 1 blockchains that support the FRAX stablecoin to be used as reserve collateral,” founder Sam Kazemian said in a message to CoinDesk. “As FRAX is on multiple blockchains, we are taking a multichain approach in proportion to demand across the chains for FRAX.”  The move will facilitate more FRAX based transactions on those blockchains and create greater demand for their layer 1 tokens, Kazemian said. Layer 1, or base, tokens are the native assets of individual blockchains, such as Ethereum, Avalanche, or Terra.  FRAX is most dominant on Ethereum at writing time, with over $2.2 billion worth of value locked. It is present on several other blockchains, meaning the company is likely to buy Avalanche’s AVAX, Binance Chain’s BNB, Fantom’s FTM and Solana’s SOL in the coming months to back the FRAX that circulates on those chains.  In addition, FRAX will be “backed by an extremely diverse range of crypto assets,” Kazemian pointed out. Some will generate cash flow while others will be on-chain loans that accumulate interest.  That will help protect against a change in the dynamics of the broader market, such as a drop in the bitcoin price that could hit other tokens and affect Frax’s reserves.  Bear market-proof  Loans held outside of crypto protocols could also act as a hedge against crypto market downturns.  “We are also exploring real-world asset loans so that there is cash flow countercyclically from crypto bear markets,” Kazemian said. “FRAX closely resembles a central bank which needs a balance sheet that is on aggregate valuable under all market conditions.""  Frax's approach differs from the one adopted by the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a non-profit that started buying billions of dollars worth of bitcoin (BTC) in March as a reserve backing for UST stablecoins, one of the two assets of the Terra protocol.  They aren’t competing, however. Terra and Frax teamed up last week to create the “4pool,” a liquidity pool on stablecoin swap service Curve Finance. The pool is composed of two algorithmic stablecoins, UST and FRAX, and two centralized stablecoins, USDC and USDT, and aims to become the most-liquid offering for traders on Curve.  Curve is the biggest decentralized finance platform on Ethereum, with over $21 billion in value locked. At the time of this writing, “tricrypto2” was the largest Ethereum-based pool on Curve by value locked, holding more than $78 million of USDT, wrapped bitcoin and wrapped ether.

After years of broken promises and hamfisted regulation, opinions are divided on whether that relative silence is really a bad thing.  French voters will have 12 presidential candidates to pick from when they vote on Sunday. Incumbent centrist Emmanuel Macron is likely to be a top finisher and will then face a run-off two weeks later against whoever comes in second – which, based on current polling, seems likely to be right-wing nationalist Marine Le Pen.  In a campaign that has seen a focus on more traditional issues including immigration, rising prices and broader internet access, crypto has barely gotten a look-in.  That may have changed, albeit slightly, after a recent study suggesting there could be hundreds of thousands of votes available. The survey, carried out by pro-crypto activist group ADAN with KPMG and pollsters IPSOS, found that 8% of French adults have invested in cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens (NFT), and 4% said the subject would determine their vote.  That’s enough to make politicians’ ears prick up, according to Faustine Fleuret, the CEO of ADAN.  Politicians “are open to [learning more] about crypto-assets,” Fleuret told CoinDesk, even if they are starting from a low knowledge base.  While she clearly welcomes that attention to crypto, she is conscious it could also come at a cost. Ideas dreamed up to fill out an election program by politicians approaching the issue from afar might not always be thought through well.  “We are quite afraid … that they want to address too early, too prematurely” the regulation of the sector, she said. Including emerging technologies like NFTs or decentralized finance (DeFi) under existing licensing regimes, for example, could strangle those initiatives at birth.  Risk vs. Opportunity  Some recent European initiatives have sought to encourage the crypto industry – allowing regulatory licenses to work across the European Union market, and allowing experiments with distributed ledger-based stocks, for instance.  But lawmakers have also highlighted concerns over the energy consumption of the proof-of-work technology that underpins bitcoin (BTC) and the use of anonymous crypto transactions in illicit activities, and have sought to legislate with restrictive provisions.  “I think in French and European speeches there is maybe a focus on risks, more than on opportunities – a focus on protection, rather than raising innovation,” Fleuret said.  She has reason to worry. Recent activity from the European Parliament – which has just agreed to laws on customer identification despite outrage within the sector – shows the dangers regulation can hold for crypto.  Real-life crypto entrepreneurs appear to agree crypto might be better off being left alone.  In Europe and elsewhere, the industry often sees regulation as “more of a risk than an opportunity,” and its task influencing new rules as “more damage control than a positive relationship,” Pascal Gauthier, CEO of French crypto company Ledger, told CoinDesk.  Ledger, which specializes in hardware wallets, is one of France’s rare unicorn companies in this space – but Gauthier complains that, whatever slogans politicians bandy about, officials do little to make his life easier.  A 2019 pledge by digital minister Cédric O to make France a leader in blockchain tech lacked an “execution plan,” Gauthier said. He said the move was mere “marketing” by the minister that didn’t translate in practice into warmer relations with the parts of the administration that caused most grief – such as BPI, the country’s state-backed lending arm.  “I don’t ask anything of politicians … I just ask for a light regulatory skeleton,” he said.  He said he’s often hit with burdensome measures that start from the assumption businesses like his are evil.  Others hope to see, if not more promises of heavy-handed regulation, at least more evidence that politicians understand the importance of crypto technology within the future economy – something that’s now lacking.  “There’s no real understanding of what the metaverse is, of what is the blockchain, the ins and outs of this technology,” lawmaker Pierre Person told CoinDesk. He fears that could lead to regulation that is “blind, stupid and dogmatic” rather than one the sector needs.  Person, a member of Macron’s party in the National Assembly in Paris, penned a landmark report on the potential of blockchain agreed by lawmakers in 2019 – but he despairs that his pro-crypto message still hasn’t really caught on.  “This is a technology which will radically change our society and our individual sovereignty,” he said. “My regret, when I see the level of the American debate and U.S. politicians on the issue – it’s much further ahead in terms of technological understanding and vision than French or European politicians.”  Name-dropping  With such a significant portion of the electorate potentially at stake, he accuses candidates of simply “name-dropping” crypto issues to curry favor.  Proposals tweeted by anti-immigrant firebrand Eric Zemmour in February were just a “copy-and-paste” of his own parliamentary report, Person said. (Some of Zemmour’s proposals do indeed seem similar). Person also takes aim at the “very superficial” comments on the metaverse made by Valérie Pécresse, representing the once-dominant French Republican Party, which is now trailing in the polls.  “There’s no real package of propositions that are strong or linked to the problems faced today,” he said – with no candidate setting out how they’d influence EU rules that could prove troublesome for the sector, for instance.  Even Macron isn’t spared criticism. Despite the president being an ex-banker who, when a minister, talked about putting sovereign bonds on the blockchain, he hasn’t put the issue on the agenda, Person said.  Macron “has always looked at crypto with interest,” Person said, but “in the last five years, we haven’t had many staging posts from the executive on the issue.”  Key to changing this attitude, many believe, will be to center crypto debates on the internet issue that most bugs French politicians – their dependence on the Big Tech companies that underpin Web 2.  Les GAFAs, as they are universally known – short for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon – are seen as underregulated, undertaxed, and – above all – foreign. Calls for France, or at least Europe, to have greater “strategic autonomy” can translate into positive support for domestic alternatives – or rather more restrictive trade barriers that can end up stifling innovation.  Don’t miss out  Rage against les GAFAs has already spilled over into the next generation of digital innovations, to their detriment. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was among those furious at the idea that Facebook might muscle into the payments market via its planned cryptocurrency, libra.  That in turn led to tough rules against stablecoins in the EU’s landmark draft crypto law known as MiCA, which some fear could damp the possibilities for decentralized finance.  But some in the crypto community are hopeful this somewhat negative debate can be turned to their advantage – by showing that distributed technology can end the centralized dominance of the current internet, and by underlining the urgency of France not missing out again, as it did with Web 2.  “Something that we insist on… is that we are not too late. We're late in the global competitions regarding crypto assets, but it's not too late,” Fleuret said, adding politicians were interested in how crypto can become a “pillar of European digital sovereignty.”  Gauthier is more blunt.  A future French president “could really make Web 3 the spearhead of Europe,” with regulation enabling the bloc to host one of the new GAFAs – a crypto exchange to rival Binance or Coinbase (COIN).  If not, he warns Europe will be imitating the unwise governments cited by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s – “If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.”  “Don’t make the first two errors, to tax heavily and to regulate heavily,” said Gauthier. “Otherwise, we know it will cost taxes to subsidize Web 3.”  Editor's note: Some interviews have been translated from French.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/08/frances-presidential-candidates-ignore-crypto-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9bfef5c87fb27d84362e65e4e1f4d4f8e33b3c1-6061x4041.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
