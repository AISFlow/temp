42378001,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpP3,1424217569,Bitcoin ATM Shutdown Spotlights Regulatory Uncertainty in Vermont,"The Department of Financial Regulation of Vermont has issued a letter to the operators of the state’s only bitcoin ATM suggesting that they may be subject to penalties for operating the machine without a money transmitter license.  Bitcoin ATM services operator PYC and Blu-Bin, a Burlington-based 3-D printing business, were both sent the correspondence, according to Vermont Public Radio, which went on to estimate the total liabilities for operating without a license at $85,000.  The agency has asserted that those involved with the machine were “knowingly engaging in a money service business” without a license, and as such, could face up to three years in prison. The $85,000 estimate includes a fine of $10,000 as well as $1,000 per day in administrative penalties.  PYC CEO Emilio Pagan-Yourno, however, downplayed the sensational claims in the article, suggesting that he has yet to personally receive a letter, and that further, his group has been in contact with state officials.  Pagan-Yourno reported that both PYC and Blu-Bin spoke to regulators two-and-a-half weeks ago, and that, due to his interpretation of state statues, he remains confident PYC needs no additional licensing in Vermont and that neither it nor Blu-Bin will pay any fines.  He told CoinDesk:  ""They said we need a license. If we need a license, so does every other entity that buys and sells bitcoin in Vermont.""  The letter alleges that to lawfully operate in the state, PYC requires a money transmission license, while Blu-Bin needs to be appointed as authorized delegates.  The Blu-Bin bitcoin ATM machine, however, is no longer active, he said, while discussions with regulators are ongoing.  PYC defiant to regulators  Pagan-Yourno went on to suggest that the incident calls into question the competence of regulators, and how well they understand bitcoin business models and services.  The CEO sought to position his company as one that was being singled out unfairly given that other online startups have been servicing state residents for some time.  ""What they don't understand is that the business model doesn’t constitute as a money transmitter,"" he said.  In particular, Pagan-Yourno cited bitcoin services provider Coinbase as an example of a company that would require licensing should PYC need to obtain it as well.  Pagan-Yourno sought to paint PYC as compliant with regulations put forth by FinCEN, stating that the company has an MSB license in all 50 states.

42377992,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpDj,1424215829,Security Standard Proposed for Bitcoin Exchanges and Wallets,"A group composed of developers and security professionals has proposed a set of rules aimed at standardizing security protocols used by companies that handle or store digital currencies for their clients.  The proposal, created by the Cryptocurrency Certification Consortium (C4) and formally unveiled on 11th February during the DevCore bitcoin development conference in Boston, Massachusetts, aims to provide an industry-level standard by which exchanges and wallet providers can operate.  The Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS) draft proposal calls for 10 standardized approaches to key and seed generation, storage and usage, proof-of-reserve and security audits, among other areas. The framework consists of three levels per section, with each grade signifying a higher degree of security based on the proposed guidelines.  C4 offers a bitcoin-focused professional certification test and its board includes Canada-based Bitcoinsultants founder Michael Perklin, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, CryptAcademy founder Russell Verbeeten and Coindroids co-founder Joshua McDougall.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Perklin said that a number of companies in the bitcoin space, including many of those that work with bitcoin security firm BitGo, have expressed active interest in the standards. The proposal was developed in partnership with BitGo, with support provided by wallet service provider Armory.  He said the proposed standard can help set a baseline of security protocols for exchanges at risk of theft or fraud, explaining:  ""Up until now, our cryptocurrency industry hasn’t had a similar standard for how to secure cryptocurrencies. Every company has had to sort of 'go it alone' and do what they think is best with respect to securing their funds – and their customers’ funds– which has lead to some good success stories, but also some spectacular failure stories.""  An aid for regulators  The release of the proposal comes as governments in countries around the world continue to debate the future of cryptocurrencies.  Perklin said he expects regulators to support standards as they discuss or develop frameworks for cryptocurrencies, particularly among agencies that were prompted to look at the sector after events like the failure of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  At the same time, Perklin questioned whether governments are ready to begin regulating bitcoin in the first place, instead advocating for the industry itself to develop solutions that work.  ""It’s one thing for government to mandate that the cryptocurrency industry take care when securing the public’s funds,"" he said. ""But frankly they’re still scrambling to learn about cryptocurrencies in the first place.""  Looking ahead  According to Perklin, the next steps for the CCSS will consist of reviewing and responding to community feedback, which he has described as both positive and constructive.  He cited the response from wallet and exchange service providers as notable, telling CoinDesk:  ""We’ve received emails from principals at major exchanges around the world who have reached out to offer their assistance in fine-tuning the draft to make it even stronger and ensure it acts to raise the bar on actual security rather than offer barriers of entry for compliance.""  C4 will soon launch a Lighthouse crowdfunding campaign later this month to raise seed capital to support the ongoing development of the standard, Perklin said.

42377995,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpGF,1424206539,Bitcoin Core 0.10 Gives Developers Simplified Access to Network Consensus,"The latest version of Bitcoin Core was released yesterday, with key changes that address the declining number of nodes, how transaction fees are set for the Bitcoin Core wallet and simplifying the process for developers to get involved with bitcoin projects.  It's perhaps the latter point that will have the biggest impact on how developers work with Bitcoin Core. The latest version of it includes a consensus library, which gives programmers easy access to the rules governing consensus on the bitcoin network, without having to run a full node.  ""We're splitting it out into a standalone library that does absolutely nothing but validates data,"" said Peter Todd, a core contributor.  Consensus library  One developer who has been awaiting the consensus library's release is Tamas Blummer of Bits of Proof. Blummer said the library means that developers like him can create more secure wallets because it will ensure that all transactions are fully validated by the network.  ""If you are out of consensus with the majority – which can happen if you're not using the same rules – it means you might think that a bitcoin is there, but in reality it is no longer there. You might accept a transaction that the majority [of the network] doesn't accept,"" Blummer said.  Put another way, if a developer isn't totally certain that a particular implementation of the consensus rules matches the majority of the network, it could result in disastrous errors, Todd pointed out. The core contributor went so far as to compare it to the challenges of designing flight avionics software:  ""It's a very complex thing [the code governing bitcoin consensus]. It's got a lot of code and it's just an incredible challenge. In flight avionics software, for example, if two planes don't have the exact same autopilot, that's okay. It doesn't matter if one turns 10 degrees less than the other – it's no big deal. But that's not the case in bitcoin.""  So-called ""thin clients"" currently rely on something called simplified payment verification (SPV). This means a client doesn't require a complete copy of the entire blockchain to verify a transaction.  Instead, SPV allows the thin clients, which include wallets like Electrum, to verify transactions with help from some other source. In Electrum's case, the client checks transactions against blockchain information obtained by its own servers which do the heavy lifting.  The risk that thin clients run is that the version of the blockchain received by the client is out of sync with the rest of the network.  ""[Clients using SPV] are not able to make the decision [to accept a transaction] entirely on its own [...] it's relying on the consensus of the network as represented by a miner,"" Blummer said.  The consensus library now combines the benefits of thin clients like doing away with downloading the entire blockchain with the security of a full node. A developer can be confident that transactions to a wallet are in full agreement with the rest of the network.  ""The new consensus library enables us to build services that fully validate Bitcoin transactions, are guaranteed to remain in sync with the majority of the network and add new features not available in the core,"" Blummer said. ""The library will spark pent-up innovation.""  Transaction fees  The latest update to Bitcoin Core will also contain a new way for its wallet to deal with transaction fees. These ""floating fees"", as outlined by Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen, will give users of the Core wallet an estimate of how much in fees to pay in order to get quick confirmations.  The updated Core does this by watching the network for confirmation times and fee estimates to find the sweet spot. One of the key benefits of the new system is shortening confirmation times for free, high-priority transactions, Andresen wrote in July.  But the new fee system isn't going to cause sweeping changes in the bitcoin economy. For starters, the wallet's estimates are only a best guess based on historic transaction data. A spike in transactions, for example, would render the wallet's estimate inaccurate, Todd said.  Mike Hearn, another core contributor, noted that the estimator could only suggest optimal fees, but it would have little effect on confirmation times if senders ignored the estimates.  ""Plenty of people are attaching much lower fees than the estimator is suggesting and things still work for them ... it seems like lots of market participants are sort of ignoring the issue right now. So it's unclear what will happen with fees now [that] 0.10 has launched,"" he said.  Todd also pointed out that the new system would only kick in for Bitcoin Core wallets:  ""[The new system] doesn't affect other wallets, it doesn't affect how the network works. It's just local to a Bitcoin Core wallet.""  Headers-first syncing  Another innocuous but important addition in the latest version is 'headers-first synchronisation', when a node first downloads parts of a block before proceeding to download the entire blockchain.  This method speeds up communications between nodes and as a result may make running a full node a more attractive prospect even as there are fears over a declining number of nodes in operation, Todd observed.  ""It just makes things more convenient. The number of nodes has been dropping, unfortunately, over the long run, so this helps fight against that,"" he said.  The last major Bitcoin Core release happened nearly a year ago, when version 0.9.0 was released on 18th March. The 0.9 series has had a number of stability and security fixes since its initial release, according to Cory Fields, another core contributor.

42377997,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpEz,1424198731,"Bitcoin Exchange Cavirtex to Close Amid Security, Banking Concerns","UPDATE (17th February 08:15 BST): This article has been updated with additional comment and information from Cavirtex regarding the exchange closure.      Canadian bitcoin exchange Cavirtex has announced that it will shut down operations next month following the compromise of sensitive security information, including password hashes and two-factor authentication secrets.  The company announced the closure in a 17th February post on its website, citing the risks of continued operation due to damage done to the exchange's reputation. The post stated that Cavirtex remains solvent and that client funds were unaffected during the incident.  Vice president of the Calgary-based exchange Kyle Kemper told CoinDesk that the exchange has been the target of hackers for some time, and acknowledged that given the ongoing security risks, customer balances are at risk of being stolen.  Kemper said:  “[The closure] has entirely to do with the fact that some of our databases were compromised. And, given the history of hackers against us, you know, it seems to be kind of never ending. We never lost any client funds but its getting to the point where it could happen.""  Kemper said that customers have been asked to alter account information on the website, including passwords, as well as re-input withdrawal balances. The closure announcement also advised users to clear all site cookies.  Trading on the exchange will cease on 20th March, and balance withdrawals will proceed until 25th March.  The exchange closure notably follows new regulations passed in Quebec just days ago, though at the time the exchange indicated it was planning to work to meet the needs of government officials. Another bitcoin exchange, Vault of Satoshi, announced its closure in early January.  Exchange outlines path ahead  The company said that it doesn't believe that all information related to account security has been compromised, but that its procedures moving forward will take those risks into account.  Cavirtex said in a statement:  ""As a precaution we have cleared all return sending addresses for all accounts. If the return address is pre filled or incorrect the account has been compromised and you need to contact us by submitting a ticket. Secondly, browser authentication tokens have been reset so we are leveraging the authenticity of your email account to authenticate users. Finally, we are encouraging people once logged in to change their passwords to further safeguard their accounts.""  The exchange declined to comment on when cryptocurrency withdrawals would be reinstated, noting that fiat withdrawals are still active and reiterating requests that users resubmit withdrawal addresses for their accounts.  Company cites banking problems in closure  According to Cavirtex, other factors behind the closure include continued problems with its banking partner.  The company declined to name the bank, but said that the costs of doing business proved difficult in the long-term.  ""It was just a difficult time for us,"" Kemper said. ""As opposed to being viewed as a valuable client partner with them, and having a good relationship with your bank, it was more a role where they were just trying to get as much out of us as they could.""  Following the publication of this article, Cavirtex provided an additional statement on the banking issues, explaining:  ""Due to the regulatory uncertainty towards bitcoin, attaining banking services is a huge challenge. Given our line of business, the risk profile of a bitcoin exchange is considered high. In speaking with banks, what is truly desired is some clarification from the government and regulators on bitcoin's legality, taxability, and usability. This would go a long way in helping bitcoin companies get banking solutions.""  Shareholder impact  When asked about shareholders of the company, including investors who used the Havelock Investments platform to purchase shares during a virtual IPO in 2013, Kemper said that the company is ""operating with shareholders in mind"", but suggested that the value of those shares could be impacted as the exchange moves to closure.  Kemper said that Cavirtex plans to first pay out customer balances before addressing shareholder value, which includes those who had previously purchased shares on Havelock.  “Depending on what the balance closing is, they will see a payout,"" he said, adding, “Anytime a company decides that it is shutting down – that doesn’t really do much good for the value.""

42377999,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LpIl,1424193959,OKCoin CTO Leaves Company Citing Differences,"OKCoin chief technical officer (CTO) Changpeng Zhao has officially announced he will depart the company, citing a difference of direction as the impetus for the decision.  Zhao joined the China-based bitcoin exchange in June, at a time when OKCoin was seeking to extend its services internationally. Today, the exchange is number two in the USD market, trailing Hong Kong-based Bitfinex.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Zhao suggested he is still open to working in the bitcoin industry, though he painted the current environment as one that might necessitate his taking an extended leave.  Zhao said:  “I am pretty sure I will still be in the bitcoin space. I think we've entered a winter phase in the bitcoin industry, but I strongly believe it will pass.”  OKCoin, in turn, suggested that the impact of Zhao’s departure would be minimal, saying that discussions regarding the departure have been ongoing for two months. It confirmed Zhao's suggestion that a difference of direction was the motivating factor in the decision.  The firm said it has “multiple employees” with experience at tech giants Alibaba and Baidu, all of whom can capably fill the CTO position.  International visibility  The departure may be unique in the bitcoin space, due to Zhao’s experience at both US and Asia-based bitcoin companies. Zhao previously served as head of development for Blockchain, before moving on to OKCoin this summer.  Outside of China, Zhao was one of the more public OKCoin figures, addressing The North American Bitcoin Conference in Chicago last July and routinely interacting with the media.  OKCoin indicated that it would seek to continue this global outreach in Zhao’s absence, adding that it is close to establishing an international office, which would be based in either Hong Kong or San Francisco.  “We have a capable and growing international team, which currently is under leadership of Jack Liu, who comes to us from Barclays,” the company said. “We have many more updates for the international market to announce soon.”  Shift toward consumer services  Though neither party commented on the nature of the differences that lead to the departure, OKCoin CEO Star Xu has been more vocal in recent months about the need for his exchange to build additional services that can bring new users to the bitcoin ecosystem.  Speaking at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) this January in Miami, Xu told CoinDesk that the company is embracing a broad plan to enter new verticals that can support this goal, while building the trust of international users.  OKCoin noted that it has left the door open to future collaborations with Zhao that may support its wider goals, stating:  “We work in the same industry as Changpeng Zhao and there is large room for cooperation. We are keeping all options open for future collaboration in the future.”  Image via LinkedIn; Featured image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/17/okcoin-cto-leaves-company-citing-differences,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7100df33fa276382ba0d082c6c32c0c3b56687ec-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
