42425275,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrph,1389827218,Pay Your Taxes With Bitcoin: SnapCard Launches 'Pay the IRS' Service,"Bitcoin-based shopping cart snapCard is expanding its offerings by launching a pay-the-IRS service for its customers.  “Tax services are truly relevant right now,” Ioannis Giannaros, one of snapCard's founders, told CoinDesk. “It’s going to be really cool.”  SnapCard users will be able to pay their taxes in bitcoin, and the company will process a USD transaction through a payment processor.  “Essentially, you fill out a form and you say how much you want to pay. Then, we invoice you.”  Tax Payment Processing With BTC  “There are payment processors that have partnered with the government already. What we’re essentially doing is [functioning as] a layer on top that accepts bitcoin,” said Giannaros.  The cost for the tax payment service is a 1.87% fee for the payment processor and a flat $10 charge from snapCard.  “We have a government payment processor, like a credit card processor, that we run the transaction through. That’s the nuts and bolts of it.”  The electronic methods of submitting owed taxes have consisted of an echeck or a credit card. Many credit card processors charge between 2-3% to make a tax payment using plastic.  “There’s a lot of attributes to the US dollar that make it monopolistic in the US, and one is paying taxes. You have to pay in dollars,” Giannaros said. “At the end of the day, you still pay in dollars through us. But it kind of alleviates the end-to-end point. It’s using bitcoin to pay your taxes.”  SnapCard and Ecommerce  SnapCard bills itself on its website as ‘the easiest way to buy anything on the Internet using bitcoin’. The company regularly charges a 2% fee (1% during the month of January) when using the shopping cart service to pay for items with bitcoin, and uses a bookmarklet to enable the checkout process.  Once a user gets to the shopping cart stage of an online purchase, he or she clicks on the snapCard bookmarklet, which forwards the data to the company for bitcoin processing. The advantage of this is that, with the exception of Overstock.com, large online retailers still don’t accept bitcoin as a payment method. Until that changes, those who want to buy items with BTC from Amazon or a majority of online retailers need to use a third-party service. SnapCard has even processed the sale of a $90,000 Mercedes Benz from a car dealership that would not accept BTC.  So far, snapCard has facilitated more than $300,000 in BTC transactions from an active base of over 2,500 users. In December, Giannaros and his co-founder Michael Dunworth told CoinDesk in an interview that they believed many of their customers were early bitcoin investors looking to spend their increasingly valuable bitcoins to promote the virtual currency.  SnapCard is currently being incubated at Boost VC, a San Mateo, CA-based startup accelerator that frequently financially backs bitcoin-based companies. A few other bitcoin startups along with snapCard will be pitching to investors at Boost’s Winter Class Demo Day on 11 February.  It’s free to sign up with snapCard. Customers have the option of linking their account to Coinbase or getting an invoice to pay to a bitcoin address within five minutes of order processing.

42425283,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvs3h,1389814373,Coinbase Rolls Out Extensive Security Update,"Coinbase has announced the addition of several new security features designed to make its cold storage business even safer.  Over the past few months the company has spent time and resources implementing the new measures and increasing the percentage of coins held offline.  Key Splitting, more cold storage  Coinbase  is now using a new “key splitting” scheme – distributing shared pieces of security keys to safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world.  This means that key holders are never located in the same geographical area. So, theoretically, there cannot be a “single point” of failure.  This is not exactly a new idea. Similar schemes have been used to safeguard nuclear weapons against accidental launch for decades and they work flawlessly, otherwise there would be nobody around at this moment to read this very article.  Coinbase  's approach also ensures all keys are protected against loss, as all data is backed up with redundancy. The move also sees Coinbase increase the overall percentage of bitcoins it currently stores offline. Until now Coinbase stored approximately 90% of its funds offline, but now the number is closer to 97%.  Of course, the actual amount changes each day, depending on how many users deposit or withdraw their bitcoins.  Two-factor authentication  Since most Coinbase users already have a phone integrated in their account, the addition of two-factor authentication comes as no surprise.  Two-factor authentication requires users to enter a verification code from their phones along with their regular password. Needless to say, this approach bolsters security even if users chose to make transactions from various computers accessible by others.  If a user chooses to send more than a certain amount (which can be set to different thresholds) out of their account, two-factor authentication will be required. Two-factor authentication will be required for any transaction over the threshold. This approach should allow users to make micro-transactions with relative ease, whilst adding another layer of security to larger transactions.  Two-factor authentication will also be deployed by the company to safeguard other sensitive actions. Coinbase's blog post revealed:  ""We have also added two-factor around various other actions on Coinbase, including recurring sends, API key actions, password changes, phone changes, Google Authenticator changes and SMS pin number changes.""  It is worth noting that two-factor authentication does not apply to Coinbase access via the API key or OAuth.  Coinbase has also overhauled its activities page, allowing users to keep track of open sessions, account activity and session history with relative ease.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/15/coinbase-rolls-out-extensive-security-update,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/623fc309282be64363cc7499814fbe60956b5427-1000x745.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425286,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvs9h,1389809856,Kanye West's Legal Team Take Down Spoof 'Coinye' Altcoin,"Just days after Chicago rapper Kanye West dispatched his legal team against the creators of the script-based cryptocurrency Coinye, formerly Coinye West, the altcoin's development team has officially folded its launch plans.      The announcement was issued via the project's website, which posted the message ""COINYE IS DEAD"" in bold at the top of its homepage, followed by its admission of defeat: ""You win, Kayne."" The messages ended the short life of Coinye, which was announced early this January and had recently delayed its launch.      West's legal team previously sent the Coinye development team a cease-and-desist letter that suggested that the altcoin's branding, featuring a cartoon image of the rapper, created a likelihood of confusion that would lead buyers to believe West was affiliated with the project.      In response, Coinye's team altered its design in homage to the South Park episode ""Fishsticks,"" in which West realizes he is a gay fish. The tongue-in-cheek letter requested that West's lawyers stop the ""constant harassment and scare tactics"" and called into question the applicability of West's trademarks in the case.    Still, while the debate amused observers, the currency's abrupt decision to close affected some users. Reddit comments suggest that Coinye's development team had begun to unload the currency in preparation for the formal shutdown. Further, threads noted that users had difficulty obtaining their coynes in the aftermath of that announcement.    0DayCoins, a cryptocurrency exchange that listed Coinye, moved quickly to apologize for its association with the currency and announce that it, too, is shutting down.      ""If Mr. Kanye West feels offended in any way, we want to express our sincere apology,"" a website message read. ""It was never our intention, and so, starting today, we are working on removing any trace of the coin from our platform. We hope this will satisfy Mr. West and resolve this unfortunate matter.""      The website encouraged users to collect their funds from the site immediately, stating that the remaining coynes would ""be sent to random public keys.""      Undeterred, some Reddit and Bitcoin Talk forum users have refused to give up on Coinye, with rumors that a petition would be sent to Cryptsy to list the altcoin.      The Coinye development team has sinced moved to distance itself from these parties, or as they labeled them, the ""morons trying to revive this coin,"" suggesting such actions were based solely on cashing in on Coinye's notoriety.    Though notable, Coinye is just one in a string of novelty altcoins launched in recent weeks including RonPaulCoin, named after the noted U.S. libertarian-leaning politician, and Dogecoin, an altcoin dedicated to a popular Internet meme.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/15/kanye-wests-legal-team-take-down-spoof-coinye-altcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad7f177a6da9639ec5b0c303df7d1ac504fa9cc5-1024x680.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425278,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrrh,1389806872,"Casascius Bitcoin Mint to Resume Sales, With a Twist","Bitcoin mint Casascius is back, resuming the sale of its products on a limited basis.  The brainchild of entrepreneur Mike Caldwell, Utah-based Casascius coins was forced to shut down operations back in December.  The company was effectively put out of business by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), after the agency classified Caldwell's activities as “money transmitting”.  At the time, Caldwell said he did not want to “argue” with FinCEN – though the decision was rather baffling, since he was merely minting physical coins.  As of yesterday, Casascius is back in business – with a catch. Caldwell is resuming sales of the aluminium coin which doesn't actually contain any bitcoins.  Unfunded coins  Writing in his blog, Caldwell explained:  “I am also planning to sell unfunded coins for 2014 ... These coins will have usable (but empty) private keys and can be fully funded by the buyer. They are essentially paper bitcoin wallets inside a coin container.”  In addition, Caldwell said he will be able to offer the original Casascius funded coins on a limited basis, but there are a number of restrictions. Namely, he can only make face-to-face sales in Utah and the coins will be only available in bulk for pre-qualified buyers.  “It is my understanding that the state of Utah does not currently consider sales of this nature to be subject to state regulation as money transmission.”  In other words, the sale of funded coins will be very limited indeed. Caldwell admitted that he does not expect much demand.  As for unfunded coins – which are now practically empty physical wallets – they will be available through the mail. To distinguish between the two coins, Caldwell has implemented some design changes.  Unfunded coins will feature quote marks around their denomination, if you can call it a domination at all, and they will no longer have a denomination etched into the hologram on the back.  It should be noted that these unfunded coins are not available yet, as Caldwell says he will need up to six weeks to produce them.

42425288,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvsDh,1389803408,Bitcoin Exchanges Go Local to Drive Adoption,"Much of the media attention surrounding bitcoin exchanges has focused on the larger global players, as they are the endpoints that have the majority of bitcoin's trading volume.  This was satisfactory in the early days of bitcoin, as global price discovery was the driving requirement – but now there is a growing need for in-country exchange transactions, due in part to prevailing regulations.  A primary example of this can be observed by analysing the role of Coinbase. With a US-only customer base for buying and selling bitcoin, Coinbase is the leading domestic exchange in the United States. If you sign up, your account identity is closely integrated with your bank or credit union for superior ease-of-use.  However, Coinbase is not really an adequate exchange for bitcoin price discovery as its bid-offer spread is derived from wholesale partners, like Bitstamp. Also, Coinbase trading participants are confined to a single region, which reflects the demand and supply from that region only.  Separate functions  Price discovery and adoption operate as two separate functions within the global bitcoin ecosystem. The additional effort involved in establishing international exchange accounts may yield improved pricing, but at what cost?  [post-quote]  Local country exchanges are simpler to use and they meet the needs of most local bitcoin traders. The larger international exchanges that provide two-way price quotes and accept deposit and withdrawal requests from around the world will always be around.  I predict that they will evolve into wholesale liquidity providers performing more of a clearinghouse role for the regional and domestic bitcoin exchange houses. Overall, global price discovery will be maintained.  Now, when we look at the local country exchanges, the precise role becomes slightly different: it becomes less about price discovery and more about ease of exchange and facilitating adoption.  One doesn't go to a broker on the worldwide interbank forex market when they want to exchange pounds for dollars, they simply go to a local bank or airport currency kiosk. Increasingly, the ATMs in airports provide the best overall exchange rates for national currencies.  Similarly for bitcoin, users will tend to stay local even if that means paying a slightly higher price and commission. And, until bitcoin merchant acceptance is widespread, the localized exchanges and bitcoin ATMs provide an excellent way for global bitcoin travelers to acquire the necessary amount of local currency.  For example, some local bitcoin exchanges in Sweden have been setting up reputable physical offices for face-to-face exchanges.  Regarding person-to-person exchanges arranged at selected meeting places, I have written about LocalBitcoins.com before. They offer an incredibly useful service which will complement, and in many cases precede, local bitcoin exchange companies.  Local focus  The marketplace for bitcoin exchanges is rapidly maturing and taking on a more specialized and local role with specific features and languages. Depending on the jurisdiction, we will see things like Bitcoin ATMs, LocalBitcoins.com directories, and physical bitcoin storefronts.  Throughout all of this, the online bitcoin exchange will operate in the local language with tailored integration into that country's financial institutions and payment methods.  In the Netherlands, the domestic Bitonic.nl exchange operates much the same as Coinbase with simple integration into a customer's bank account. With just 10 major banks in the country, Dutch company Bitonic can link with all of them by just going through the iDEAL e-commerce payment network.  In Sweden, the country boasts at least four domestic exchanges that cater exclusively to the Swedish market for bitcoins, including btcx.se, Safello, Kapiton, and FYB-SE.  Recently in India, it came to light that a burgeoning entrepreneurial class was driving bitcoin adoption in that country with domestic exchanges like buysellbitco, Unocoin and INRBTC, BitQuick.in.  Hong Kong has probably seen one of the most rapid increases in bitcoin exchange activity. Outside of mainland China, Hong Kong operators enjoy access to a leading financial services center prompting many to speculate that it could quickly become a digital currency trading hub and pave the way into China. Both Bitfinex and ANXBTC are based in Hong Kong.  These are the types of exchanges that will be driving bitcoin forward in the developing world. Many of them are not really known outside of their local regions but they represent the trend unfolding in bitcoin trading volume where domestic retail exchanges cater to local needs and the global exchanges operate at the wholesale level.  The allure of the vast global remittance market has attracted entrepreneurs for years and the dream is slowly being realized as centralized and legacy infrastructure gives way to multiple bitcoin endpoints. We may not even notice the new network being built, but cross-border transactions in bitcoin operate on a 24-hour basis and they don't require permission.  Soon, the domestic bitcoin exchanges in your country will start to seem as ubiquitous and pervasive as petrol stations or mobile phone stores. That will be a truly global network. The ultimate victory comes when received bitcoin is held and spent, not exchanged.

42425290,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvsFh,1389799207,Venture Capitalist Chris Dixon Believes Bitcoin Will Hit $100k,"Bitcoin was on a wild roller-coaster ride for much of 2013.  The digital currency has been trading in the triple digit territory for weeks, but there is no shortage of optimists who believe it will soon go north of $1,000 – and then some.  Chris Dixon  , a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Andreessen Horowitz partner, believes a single bitcoin might even be worth $100,000. However, for that to happen bitcoin adoption would have to go through the roof.  Dixon believes the $100,000 mark could be reached if bitcoin becomes the primary means of making online transactions.  [post-quote]  Of course, this will not happen anytime soon, as the bitcoin economy is still underdeveloped and relatively small – tiny when compared to most national economies.  Dixon also compares bitcoins to internet domain names. In the early nineties internet domains were practically worthless and nobody expected some of them would be worth millions just a decade later. This is not the first time this controversial analogy has been summoned.  “It would have been absurd to say in 1993 that domain names were worth $10m each,” Dixon told Wired magazine.  The scarce resource argument  Dixon points out that many start-ups supported by Andreessen Horowitz often pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for domain names that include “average” words.  In hindsight, the best investment you could have made in tech was not Google or Amazon, but internet domains in 1993, Dixon argues.  Critics argue that the analogy does not work in the real world, as the vast majority of domains are still worthless and the supply of domain names is not capped like bitcoin. Only flashy domains with great names can rake in millions, but all bitcoins are essentially the same.  Regulation issues  For everything to line up perfectly, bitcoin would need to gain plenty of traction among businesses, and governments would have to find a way of living with bitcoin transactions. The latter might not be quite so easy to overcome.  Although some libertarians are in favour of bitcoin, the vast majority of regulators and lawmakers are not. Dixon argues that every large-scale technology movement has a political component.  In other words, if the business community wants bitcoin to thrive, if consumers want to use it, politicians will simply have to find a way of reconciling their concerns with demands made by their constituency. More importantly, they will have to reconcile their interests with the interests of their backers in the business community.  Andreessen Horowitz is not new to bitcoin. Last December it raised $25m in funding for Coinbase, the biggest funding deal in bitcoin's history.

42425276,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrlh,1389796256,Irish Lawmaker Calls for Investigation Into Bitcoin and Deep Web,"A member of the Teachta Dála, the lower house of Ireland's Parliament, has urged fellow lawmakers and the parliamentary communications committee to investigate the effect of digital currencies on illicit financial transactions.  Patrick O’Donovan, who is a member of the centre-right Fine Gael party, wrote to the committee asking them to investigate the use of digital currencies, claiming that they have created an “online supermarket” for illegal goods and services. He also called for more controls on payments made using digital currencies, reports The Journal.  A boon for black markets  O’Donovan argued that the anonymity of online transactions (made possible by digital currencies) has allowed the black market to flourish. He said digital currencies make it extremely difficult to identify the buyers of illegal goods such as firearms and drugs. He added:  “We need a national and international response to clamp down on this illicit trade.”  In addition, O’Donovan plans to raise the issue with the executive branch, namely the Department of Justice and Department of Communications.  Deep web concerns  O’Donovan added that an EU-wide response should be developed to address concerns raised by the advent of open-source internet browsers, adding that such browsers “protect anonymity” to facilitate illegal online activities.  This, of course, has nothing to do with bitcoin – it's a clear swipe at the deep web and the Tor browser, previously known as The Onion Router.  It should be noted that The Pirate Bay recently announced plans to create a new peer-to-peer internet standard that might irk O’Donovan as soon as he hears about it.  It is unclear whether O’Donovan’s crusade against digital currencies and anonymous browsing will yield any results, as earlier attempts to clamp down on deep web have failed miserably.  Although some of the currency's proponents tend to argue that the deep web should be left unregulated, others are just as hostile toward the service as most lawmakers.  As long as the deep web is a bazaar for all things illegal, it seems the public perception of bitcoin will continue to suffer.

42425287,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvsBh,1389792813,French Senate Holds Hearings on Bitcoin,"The Senate of France has conducted hearings into bitcoin and other digital currencies, with a number of speakers from the industry presenting their case today.  The Senate Finance Committee hearing on 15th January was chaired by Philippe Marini of political party UMP, and featured a number of high-profile representatives from the Bank of France, the Treasury Department, the Ministry of Finance's anti-money laundering arm Tracfin (Traitement du renseignement et action contre les circuits financiers clandestins), DNRED (National Directorate of Intelligence and Customs Investigations) and FING (Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération).  Speaking on bitcoin's behalf was Gonzague Grandval, co-founder and CEO of Paymium, which operates the bitcoin exchange Bitcoin-Central for Eurozone customers and its own payment processing service for merchants accepting bitcoin.  Positive approach  Again, the initial focus seemed to be on the risks and hazards of ""unregulated currencies"" and the ability to exchange them into ""real world"" legal tender.  Reddit users 'mmitech', 'Schlagv' and 'bitcoin-artist' watched a live broadcast of events and posted brief summaries of the outcome. Among the highlights were:  The French authorities see digital currencies as a kind of competition between powerful economies like the USA, Germany and UK, and feel a need for France to catch up.  Making bitcoin illegal is not an option and there seems to be genuine innovation behind it. That said, they do not know yet what to do next or how it could be regulated.  Committee Chairman Marini was open to new information and didn't show any bias against bitcoin, saying France should embrace and welcome new technologies.  The Senate committee apparently didn't understand the concept of a decentralized and distributed system like bitcoin, asking ""Who owns the protocol?"" and seeming not to follow when the answer was ""No-one"".  The head of anti-money laundering arm Tracfin said they have been monitoring bitcoin's progress since 2011, and are ""ready to catch the bad guys"".  While negative points like volatility, investment risk and use in illicit activities was mentioned, it was not a focus and even speculation was not considered a bad thing.  Bitcoin enthusiast Adrien Lafuma, of MasterXchange, said the French government would prefer to regulate digital currencies than try to prevent their use, but was curious about how to calculate taxes in currencies that can't be tracked or detected. He said it acknowledged bitcoin is not a passing fad, but it is also not currency by the Banque De France's definition and would take some time to reach a consensus on how to properly approach it.  Paymium's Grandval reportedly became upset at the use of the word ""tulips,"" by the head of Tracfin, a reference to the cliche often employed by bitcoin detractors comparing digital currency speculation to the Dutch Tulip Mania market bubble of the 1630s.  He also hinted that Germany was ahead of France in this area, suggesting France probably didn't want to be left behind.  There was also news that a new Bitcoin Foundation for Europe will be formed.  Wait and see  Overall, the French Senate took a similar approach to that of the US Senate in November, acknowledging that bitcoin and digital currencies are indeed a real phenomenon and cannot simply be ignored, but understanding there are still many questions as to the role they will play and where it fits legally.  That said, there is still much that the French authorities (and others globally) do not understand about bitcoin and digital currencies, so most are still taking a ""wait and see"" approach before deciding how government should be involved.  This probably mirrors governments' approach to the early Internet, which grew at too fast a pace for most legislators to understand. Attempts to regulate the space according to traditional media rules have been largely futile.

Plasman has contested this decision, and continues to accept payments in the currency.  _______________________________________________________________  Are you in desperate need of legal advice in the Netherlands? Struggling with money transfers to pay for a lawyer after some unfortunate incident in an Amsterdam nightclub?  Well, you can now hire one of the Netherlands’ most high-profile criminal defence lawyers, and pay in bitcoin.  Peter Plasman  is one of the Netherlands best-known defence lawyers, with an office of 23 staff in central Amsterdam. He is a regular fixture on Dutch news after a number of high profile cases.  [post-quote]  In 2000, Plasman defended the manager of a fireworks company after an explosion at the company’s factory and in 2005 he defended Mohammed Bouyer, later convicted of murdering filmmaker Theo Van Gogh.  Now he's back in the news again, this time for deciding to accept bitcoin as payment for all his legal fees.  According to Plasman's office, the system is already up and running. They have set up a contract with the Atlanta-based payment processing company Bitpay and Plasman is already advertising bitcoin as a payment option on his website.  As it stands, his firm is still waiting for the first transaction to take place but say there are “many people who are interested in paying with bitcoin”.  Plasman himself has been interested in bitcoin “for some time"" but has not yet had a case involving the digital currency. Rather, his interest comes from a customer service perspective. His office said in a written statement:  “Mr Plasman [...] believes bitcoin offers considerable benefits: speed, low transaction fees, being able to function as a cheap and safe store of value. By pioneering and accepting Bitcoin as the first in his field, he hopes to spur adoption of the technology.”  Bitcoin overseas  Across the Atlantic, several US defence lawyers already accept bitcoin as payments for legal services. In July 2013, Manhattan law firm Nesenoff & Miltenberg announced that they would accept bitcoin for legal fees.  Additionally, in December 2013 the office of South Carolina-based lawyer David Aylor announced that he had accepted a bitcoin payment - representing the first legal fee paid with bitcoin in the US. A website called Coinlaw is also providing legal advice online and accept payments in bitcoin.  For the general public, bitcoin is often associated with the murky world of crime and online drug trading. Plasman says he is aware that in accepting the cryptocurrency he may face criticism for being “too close” with the criminal world. He maintains that this is something that defence lawyers must always pay attention to, and deal with in an appropriate manner. His office said:  “He takes the bitcoin phenomenon very seriously, wants to take a pioneering position and is not afraid of the public opinion in doing so.”  Good news for anyone with a bitcoin wallet and trouble with the law in the Netherlands. If you are considering his services, you'll have to make sure your wallet is fully loaded, as Plasman charges €300 (around $408) per hour.

Bitcoinmania  Like many small business owners, Heliflight’s general manager Ton van Kempen was first introduced to the cryptocurrency after a tech-savvy employee involved in “bitcoinmania” pointed him to the currency’s possibilities.  Van Kempen later researched the benefits of bitcoin over regular fiat currencies, like his native euro, and decided to accept the fledgling coin. He said:  “Despite not being backed by a central bank or government, [bitcoin] offers something that no other regular currency can right now. Speed, ease of payments and the possibility of global transactions make bitcoin, all in all, a concept that has something to offer.”  He added: “Although bitcoin is in its infancy, we strive to be innovative in every part of our operation, and bitcoin payments fit with that.""    The dutch company has been flying helicopters since the early 1990s. As van Kempen explains: “Back then we only had one small Schweitzer 300 helicopter, a machine used for inspection work, photo-flights and weddings.""  In the years since, business has taken off and the company’s fleet has expanded. Heliflight is now one of the largest operators in the Netherlands, offering a range of onshore services, including: VIP packages, charter flights and sightseeing tours.  Managing risks  Bitcoin could seem an unlikely fit for a risk-adverse industry like aviation. However, Heliflight has chosen to use payment processor Bitpay for its transactions, a popular choice for many merchants in the bitcoin ecosystem.  [post-quote]  Bitpay minimises the risks that come with bitcoin’s volatility since, at the end of the day, the company will receive payment in euros or other fiat currency.  Last year, Bitpay processed more than $100m in bitcoin transactions and bought the currency to a number of popular retailers, such as Gyft and Shopify.  More recently, the platform helped well-known game giant Zynga to accept bitcoin. Van Kempen added: “I see no good reason for web merchants not to accept bitcoin payments in this fashion.""  Currently, Heliflight is only accepting bitcoin payments for its sightseeing packages, which cost between €49.95 and €179.00 and range from 7.5 minutes to half an hour.  As van Kempen explains, helicopter charters are quite expensive (the average price is around the €2,500 mark). As large sums are involved, van Kempen argues bitcoin's volatility is too much of a risk for the company's charter flights.  However, if bitcoin does stabilise, van Kempen sees no good reason not to roll out bitcoin payments to Heliflight's other service packages.  “We believe in staying innovative and are always looking for new concepts or ways of doing business, accepting bitcoins fits that. We will be ready to make further steps once it stabilizes.""

42425282,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvs1h,1389759480,Online Eyewear Giant Coastal to Accept Bitcoin,"Large Canadian ecommerce firm Coastal Contacts has announced that it is adopting bitcoin as a payment mechanism. The firm, which conducts its sales online, will begin accepting the currency within months, it said.  Founded in 2000, Burnaby, BC-based Coastal specialises in direct-to-consumer sales, cutting out intermediaries in markets that have traditionally relied on them. It is the firm behind Clearly Contacts, a brand that focused on online sales for eyeglasses and contact lenses. Customers enter their prescription details and order from an online selection. Although it operates online, it does have some retail outlets for customers to try on eyewear and order glasses from.  Coastal is also an investor in ShoeMe, a business started by a former employee, which does the same thing for footwear.  The firm, which will host its 2013 annual earnings call next week, made CAD$196m in revenues in calendar 2012. It made $22.8m in profit on revenues of $55.6m in the quarter ending 31 July 2013. It represents a big win for bitcoin, with over 4.1m worldwide customers and 650 employees. In addition to the US and Canada, it operates in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Brazil.  Coastal said that it decided to accept bitcoin after demand from customers. ""The demand has been small but aligns with a key demographic for us – innovators,"" it said in a statement.  The percentage of revenue coming from bitcoin is difficult to estimate. ""We anticipate it being a small percentage immediately, but as acceptance of the currency grows, we want to be prepared to allow consumers to pay in whatever method is most convenient to them,"" the firm said.  Coastal is committed to launching bitcoin support in the next quarter, although it is keeping wraps on which payment processor it will work with for now. Its IT group is integrating payment gateways now. It will probably convert its bitcoin to fiat currency, minimising its exposure to currency fluctuations.  Coastal also signed a partnership with Overstock last month to supply its eyewear to the US firm's customer base. Overstock made headlines earlier this month by announcing its own bitcoin sales, scooping $130,000 within the first day.

42425280,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvrxh,1389746958,Wells Fargo Holds Summit on Bitcoin Engagement,"Wells Fargo bank has assembled a group of experts that met in San Francisco today to discuss the ""rules of engagement"" for bitcoin, the company has confirmed.  Digital currency experts, executives from the finance industry, and members of the US government are all said to be on the action team to discuss the bank's attitude to bitcoin in the future. The group was assembled by Jim Richards, the head of anti-money-laundering at the bank.  ""We are gathering a group of internal and external experts and interested parties to help us understand virtual currencies as well as the digital currency payment system. We are looking to learn and become better informed in that area,"" a source at Wells Fargo told CoinDesk today.  Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly visible part of the monetary landscape, garnering not only a report from the Congressional Research Service last month, but also warranting two hearings from Congressional committees, one of which explored banking regulation as a discrete topic.  At that November hearing, banking industry representatives called for more regulation of the digital currency, arguing that controls were needed to ensure that illicit transactions could not take place. Regulation was needed to ""legitimize"" the digital currency, warned Paul Smocer, the president of BITS. BITS is the technology policy division of The Financial Services Roundtable – an industry body set up by the financial services industry to explore approaches to new technologies.  Bitcoin companies have traditionally been plagued by strained banking relationships. Banks have closed accounts without warning, or simply refused to open them at all. Some companies have negotiated working partnerships. Coinlab famously signed an agreement with Silicon Valley Bank last year, although since then, grassroots reports have emerged of others being refused accounts. Tradehill, an exchange for high net worth individuals, ceased trading after the firm's relationship with the Internet Archive Credit Union, fell through.  Government regulations already steer bitcoin policy for Wells Fargo, which is a federally regulated entity. ""It’s a rapidly evolving area, and there has been some guidance shared. But what we have seen says in part that administrator exchanging it for federal currency is a money transmitter under federal regulations,"" the Wells Fargo spokesperson said, explaining why it is so difficult to have a clear policy on whether it will do business with a bitcoin-based company.  ""We are working to make sure that we are meeting our due diligence requirements. That if we are providing services to those companies, that we look at federal registration, state licensing, business background, AML procedures, all of that due diligence.""  It is still unclear what will transpire from the meeting, and how positive the group will be toward bitcoin. Indeed, one legal contact of CoinDesks's refused to comment on the story until more substantive news emerged of the firm's position. Wells Fargo would not reveal which people were involved in the discussion, and as testimony at the banking hearing showed, opinions differ wildly on how aggressive regulators should be toward bitcoin.  Nevertheless, the fact that Wells Fargo is holding the meeting at all must be a positive sign for the digital currency community. It is the largest bank by market capitalisation, and has over 9000 retail branches across the US. Any clarity in banking policy at this level will doubtless steer opinion elsewhere in the banking community.  ""Wells Fargo could remake the Bitcoin business in the US overnight,"" said Ryan Singer, co-founder of Tradehill, who has since left to pursue another company in the bitcoin security space. ""They have the expertise, knowledge and clout necessary to deal with concerns about AML compliance and banking risk. If they are truly getting close to being ready to experiment with bitcoin, then every bitcoin startup should be lining up to learn more. It's also worth mentioning that they are active FinTech investors.""
