42376467,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ai5b,1369079775,BitInstant's Charlie Shrem sees Bitcoin battles ahead #Bitcoin2013,"Largely untapped markets such as global remittances represent a huge opportunity for Bitcoin, but the digital currency has not yet arrived at its most difficult stage of development, BitInstant founder Charlie Shrem said at this past weekend's Bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose.  ""Global remittance is one thing that Bitcoin can do really well,"" Shrem said, giving the example of a nurse working in the US who wants to send most of her pay back to family in the Philippines. Using a money transfer service such as Western Union, the nurse would have to pay a large fee and wait a week for the money to arrive.  ""That doesn't make sense,"" Shrem said. If more foreign workers adopted Bitcoin, they would be able to safely and instantly send money home to families at low costs, he said.  Shrem's optimism for the potential of Bitcoin, which he refers to as ""cash with wings,"" is tempered by the difficult fights with regulators he expects lie ahead. At this point, he said, Bitcoin is at the stage where more people have heard of it, but most people dismiss it as something silly. This, Shrem said, is not the scary stage.  ""The scary stage is the fighting stage,"" he continued. ""That's when we're going to see regulators coming down hard .... Look what happened with Mt. Gox."" (The US Department of Homeland Security last week seized funds from Mt. Gox, the world's largest bitcoin exchange, and Dwolla, alleging that Mt. Gox and a subsidiary were operating as unlicensed money transmitting businesses.)  To survive the fighting stage, Bitcoin companies will have to work hard to comply with regulations, Shrem warned.  ""You have to know your customer,"" he said. ""Anyone doing anything in the bitcoin space, you have to know your customer. It's a very big problem when you have someone trying to start a bitcoin company saying, 'I'm going to let anyone use my system and have a nice day.' ""  Shrem continued, ""Whether you agree with the regulations or not, you have to follow them."" Or, he added, try to change them.  Shrem credited the crowd at Bitcoin 2013 for understanding the true nature of the digital currency better than those who are just now hearing about it.  ""An issue that I have found, explaining Bitcoin to people, is they assume it's this anonymous currency that's used by drug dealers and terrorists, blah blah blah,"" Shrem said. ""A lot of us know that's not true. A lot of us have startups which are trying to take Bitcoin and make it mainstream.""  Bitcoin can provide privacy in transactions but is not inherently anonymous, he said.  Shrem touched on a number of other topics during his talk:  On Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto: ""Satoshi built this amazing product and then he disappeared. I don't know why he disappeared but ... (I think he wanted it to grow organically).""  On BitInstant's ""Know Your Customer"" verifications (noting that, if customers provide a Social Security Number or other identification, they can get higher daily limits): ""It's more like, 'You trust us, we trust you.' ... A lot of regulators frowned on that, but I said it's going to work, and it has been working so far.""  On Ripple: ""I think Ripple is extremely complementary to Bitcoin. It has this good infrastructure. It's a little complicated ... It's a value transfer system.""  On the security of Bitcoin: ""Bitcoin is a protocol. I hate when people tell me Bitcoin was hacked. I send them an article about how $45 million was stolen from an ATM machine -- the dollar was hacked!""  On the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's recent Bitcoin guidance: ""It's important that that happened for a few reasons, because it shows that it's on the radar, they see it, they're not automatically going to come down on it hard ... That FinCen guidance that came out said, people who hold bitcoin, they're OK, they're not going to jail ... but at the same time, companies like mine need to be super careful.""  (Shrem noted that FinCen was also giving a free pass to the states to start regulating Bitcoin when they said Bitcoin companies are money transmitters.)  ""There's so much regulation that I feel like it's pushing down innovation,"" Shrem said, adding that -- while it's important to have regulations for the protection of consumers -- it would be nice if regulations were standardized so businesspeople like him did not have to get fingerprinted again and again to comply with every state's requirements.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/20/bitinstants-charlie-shrem-sees-bitcoin-battles-ahead-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89e1f5dc1666741d59cd3a92ee2b09dcac680ac8-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376469,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ai87,1369075063,Butterfly Labs ships long-awaited ASIC bitcoin miners,"It's eight months late, but it looks as though Butterfly Labs is finally starting to ship some of its ASIC bitcoin mining equipment to customers.  The Kansas-based company has repeatedly delayed customer shipments of its ASIC mining products, which were originally announced last June, and were scheduled to ship starting last October. Customers are getting angry, and the company’s representatives aren’t helping by trading insults on public forums.  On Sunday, though, a Butterfly Labs representative posted on the company's support forum that shipments were beginning. “A few went out Saturday and more will be ready to go Monday,” he wrote, adding that the shipments were mostly from orders placed in June last year, almost a year ago.  Customers are reporting deliveries  . Indeed, an unofficial site has been set up to try and track the shipment queue.  Butterfly Labs  has promised four equipment configurations, ranging from the 5 Ghashes/sec Jalapeno, through to the 1,500 Ghashes/sec Mini Rig. The Jalapeno was touted as a coffee coaster-sized unit that would be powered via a USB port.  In the middle were the ""Little Single"" and ""Single"" boxes, offering middle-range hashing power, somewhere between the small and the large rigs.  Customers have been placing pre-orders for 10 months but, aside from a few early units reviewed by the press, none has appeared. Butterfly Labs has a refund policy for customers who are fed up waiting but, nevertheless, the bitcoin forums are buzzing with irritated buyers.  The ASIC business had started promisingly for Butterfly Labs. The firm publicized the specifications for its ASIC mining gear in Bitcoin Magazine last September. Users could expect mining for 1 watt per Ghash/sec, according to the article. All the devices would use custom 65-nm ASICs, which would help to keep the power consumption down.  Within months, though, things went awry. In January, company spokesperson Josh Zerlan posted an apology on the firm’s discussion board, acknowledging continuing delays.  “We had fully intended to be ready by October for shipping and deeply regret that we have not been able to meet our timelines,” he wrote. “Our delays are a result of the complexity of the project and we have overcome essentially all obstacles at this point and are in the home stretch.”  But that final furlong was longer than anticipated. At the end of January, Zerlan posted about a projected February ship date: “If the worst case scenario in every step comes to pass, we are looking at starting shipping around Monday the 18th.”  Then, at the end of March, nearly six weeks later, came more news: the company was having problems with the power needed to run the units.  “In the interest of time, we are planning on potentially scaling back units hashing speed as required to accommodate the extra power and shipping multiple units to those that want their units right now,” Zerlan noted. The next day, he issued a clarification: “We are not shipping yet.”  On April 15, Zerlan said the company was getting hardware and software issues “nailed down”. He cited the need to re-engineer the power system on the boards, adding it had become clear that the original power consumption specification for the 5 Ghash/sec units wasn’t going to fly: “Power usage exceeds the 1w/GH, unfortunately, but it's much better than anything out by 40 - 50 percent, at the wall.”  Finally, in April, a small number of devices started appearing. Zerlan said that the company had shipped 35 of them, half to developers and the media, and the other half to customers.  But that didn’t take the firm into full-scale production. Early this month, he posted that the chip supplier was “dragging their feet”. Three days later, he reported that the Butterfly Labs testing facility was expecting 100 chips in Chicago on May 14.  “We are having some trouble with the new Single board and we are working through the issues now and should hopefully have a resolution before the end of the week,” Zerlan added.  Zerlan, who didn’t respond to messages from CoinDesk, has been less polite on enthusiast forums. On May 14, the day the chips were meant to arrive, he responded to a question from one customer on the Bitcoin Talk forum who had asked about prior shipment delays.  “You received no answer because your question was so incredibly stupid that it doesn't deserve an answer,” Zerlan wrote, adding later, “This is why I don't take you seriously... you can't even form a cogent thought on simple mechanics, such as assembly.”  But others who claim experience in the field also have questions. “I have a bit of experience with VLSI and one of the things that we always worry about is the power consumption and the cooling system,” said Colorado-based mathematician Charles Hoskinson, director of the Bitcoin Education Project and a student of cryptography.  Butterfly Labs might well fit 5 Ghashes/sec into a small box that sits on a desk, but Hoskinson's concern is around the largest product in its lineup: the 1,500 Ghash/sec Minirig unit, which was originally priced at $30,000, and for which the firm has been taking pre-orders  “I figured this product couldn’t exist,” Hoskinson told CoinDesk.  Why? At the 1 watt per Gigahash/sec spec that Butterfly Labs originally suggested, scaling up the power consumption on the 5 GHash/sec units to 1,500GHash/sec would require around 1500 watts. Hoskinson says that chips doing this sort of mathematical heavy lifting need lots of cooling.  “There are many fans running concurrently,"" he said. ""It’s a big power supply running very hot.”  Nevertheless, at 1 watt per Ghash/sec, it’s not impractical. A microwave oven would chew through about as much power.  The Single 5 Ghash/sec Jalapeno units seem to consume decidedly more.  “Imagine six times that power consumption,” Hoskinson said.  David Perry, one blogger who received a 5 Ghash/sec unit, discovered that it consumed around 30 watts. (CoinDesk wrote about Perry unboxing one unit in a sneak preview.) That equates to around 6 watts per Ghash/sec. Ars Technica said that its unit consumed 50 watts, which equals 10 watts per Ghash/sec.  Aside from the power consumption, there's been another change from the original spec: the size. No longer is the Jalapeno a coffee coaster-sized unit. It's far thicker. A heat sink seems to have taken up the extra space, as demonstrated by Ars Technica’s pictures of the heat sink for the 5 Ghash/sec unit.  “You’re talking about something that’s about 9 kilowatts of power in the space of a computer case,” said Hoskinson, working from those figures. “If they were talking about an eight-foot foot server chassis, then that would make much more sense.”  Yet the Mini Rig pictured on the Butterfly Labs web site is clearly far smaller. The device, which uses an eight-inch Nexus 7 for a control panel, appears to be around 18 inches high and perhaps two to two-and-a-half feet long.  Nevertheless, some customers are keeping the faith, waiting for those 1,500 Ghash/sec Mini Rigs ... and losing money daily. Emmanuel Abiodun, founder of UK cloud-based mining company Cloudhashing, ordered four units from Butterfly Labs between February and April. Butterfly Labs recently revised the shipment date for his units from early May to June.  “We would have had two by now,"" Abiodun said. “At the current difficulty I would be making $15,870 per day. It’s a big loss.”  Abiodun also had to make contingency plans that almost doubled his existing hardware investment.  “They’re saying they are having delays,” Abiodun said. “I have not received the units now, and because I fear that I might not get delivery in June, I had to spend $100k today purchasing loads of Avalon equipment to get me running for my customers.”  Unlike the other rigs on the Butterfly Labs web site, the 1,500 Ghash/sec rigs on the Butterfly Labs site are listed as out of stock. The company is not publishing current power specifications for any of its products.  Still, Abiodun isn’t fazed.  “What they’ve said in their messages to all of us is that they’re finding the power consumption has increased, but to handle the increased power consumption, they might have to double up on a unit,” he said. One option is to reduce the amount of chips that they put into a Mini Rig, and send people two instead, along with extra ""Singles"" – the 5 Ghash/sec boxes – to bump up the hash rate.  But it isn’t clear when or if this will happen, and customers like Abiodun could be in for a long wait.  “We don't know when the Mini Rig will be redesigned, how fast it will be, how much it will cost, etc,” the Butterfly Labs representative noted Sunday while reporting the Jalapeno shipments. “We are concentrating on getting our backlog of orders shipped.”  Customers are getting refunds, but Abiodun maintains that many of them will stay in the queue, eager to finally get the equipment that could see them generating bitcoins far faster than they could with GPUs or FPGAs.  “People are so fed up with waiting they don’t care about the power consumption,” Abiodun said. “It’s a game of getting it sooner than later.”  Abiodun added that he just ordered a custom-built, 2,000 Ghash/sec Avalon-based machine consuming 14.6 kilowatts of power.  “That’s 7.3 kilowatts per Ghash/sec,” he pointed out.  There's at least one more complication in the Butterfly Labs story. The company is likely to have taken in a significant amount of money from customers over the past 10 months, and accepts payments in either bitcoins or dollars. When Butterfly Labs started taking orders in June 2012, bitcoins traded at under $10. This week, the currency once again broke past the $120 mark.  If customers get refunds, will they be refunded with bitcoins at current market value? If not, who gets the profit? Neither Zerlan or Butterfly Labs’ president Sonny Vleisides returned our calls or mails.  Such is the level of concern over Butterfly Labs’ continuing delays that entire third-party websites have been set up to track the company's progress. Will the firm get more chips from the manufacturer soon? Will they be able to sustain shipments to fill the order backlog, or will shipments continue to sputter and stall?  Many customers are hoping for the best ... and they’re determined not to budge from the queue. With bitcoins trading an order of magnitude higher than they were nine months ago, gigahashes are a hot commodity indeed.

42376478,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiKh,1369071646,BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi warns against DIY Bitcoin fails #Bitcoin2013,"BitPay  CEO Tony Gallippi made a case at Bitcoin 2013 for why the digital currency needs payment networks like his.  With services like his, Bitcoin is far more secure and affordable than credit cards, Gallippi argued.  ""The peer-to-peer payment network that Bitcoin is, it's not really that new, when you look at the three technologies that it brings forward,"" Gallippi said, referring to the cloud, mobile and open source. ""Bitcoin is an accounting ledger in the cloud.""  The digital currency is much more than that, though, he added.  ""These are three growing trends in the world today, and Bitcoin is all three,"" Gallippi said. ""Bitcoin is in the cloud, Bitcoin is fully mobile, and Bitcoin is open source.""  Accepting bitcoins without the help of a payment network is like other do-it-yourself projects that can risk sometimes disastrous outcomes, Gallippi said, illustrating his point with photos of fails like an ATM machine installed high out of users' reach, and a bathroom faucet that ran water onto the counter instead of into the basin.  In the world of bitcoins, Gallippi continued, DIY involves installing and securing your own software, creating your own automation, and assuming the risks of volatility, complex financial reporting and all sorts of legal and regulatory uncertainties.  ""Companies say, I understand the value, but I don't want to touch this with a 10-foot pole,"" he said. ""Too much risk.""  With a service like BitPay's, on the other hand, clients can get full automation and daily direct deposits in dollars if that's what merchants want, Gallippi said. That means merchants need never actually hold any bitcoins, he said, which eliminates their exposure to the currency's notorious volatility.  ""We try to make it easy to accept Bitcoin,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/20/bitpay-ceo-tony-gallippi-warns-against-diy-bitcoin-fails-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8359ae9b299026c5019734529f0963b76fff923b-628x392.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376474,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiEP,1369070835,"CoinDesk talks with Roger Ver, 'Bitcoin Jesus' #Bitcoin2013","Bitcoin investor and evangelist Roger Ver -- ""Bitcoin Jesus,"" some call him -- used bitcoins to buy his plane ticket from Tokyo, where he lives, to San Jose for Bitcoin 2013.  He asked the parking lot attendant at the San Jose Convention Center if he could pay for his parking with bitcoins too (no dice). In fact, Ver pays for as much as he possibly can with the currency. He's invested more than a million dollars in it and holds his savings in it. And if all that is not enough, the man listens to the sounds of bitcoin transactions as background music as he goes about his day.  Ver can truly be considered the Bitcoin movement's most fervent proponent. He sat down with CoinDesk for an impassioned discussion about why he's sunk his life savings into Bitcoin (Ver amassed his wealth by starting Memory Dealers, which he still operates) and how he believes the cryptocurrency will make the world a better place.  Ver has lived in Tokyo for the past seven years. He moved there, he says, because he no longer felt safe in the United States after serving a federal prison sentence for selling fireworks that he believed to be legal. He believes he was unfairly targeted because of comments he'd made while running for California State Assembly as a Libertarian candidate.  Nowadays, Ver considers himself a voluntarist. But he still embraces the view that, despite good intentions, most government actions have bad results in the end. That's part of why he believes in Bitcoin -- because he believes people should have the ability to make transactions outside the government's sphere of control.  CoinDesk: Did your prosecution inspire your interest in Bitcoin?  Ver: My political views before my run-in with the law were more abstract and philosophical ... It became much more real. The thing that has me most excited about Bitcoin is all the ways it will strip government control away.  CoinDesk: It seems that you are involved with everything in the Bitcoin world. What are all the Bitcoin companies you've invested in?  Ver: Bitcoinstore.com (which Ver owns), Bitinstant.com, Bitpay.com, Blockchain.info, Coinlab.com, Coinsetter.com, Payward.com, Ripple.com and a few that didn't make it. (Ver also provided the seed money to set up The Bitcoin Foundation, and is involved in the Web site LoveBitcoins.com.) I'm an early adopter of bitcoin, we'll leave it at that.  (Ver's investments were worth more than $1 million when he made them, but since some were made in bitcoins, they represent an even greater value at today's exchange rate. He also holds his savings primarily in bitcoins, although he declines to say how much he holds. Ver says he reports his bitcoin holdings to the IRS, because he does not ever want to go to prison again. But he doesn't necessarily advise that everyone does so: ""I think everyone should follow their heart and do what they think is best,"" he says.)  CoinDesk: Do you have a number in your head of what a bitcoin will eventually be worth?  Ver: If Bitcoin becomes really popular, each bitccoin will have to be worth at least tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds of thousands ... I think (that could happen in) less than a decade. Look at how quickly PayPal put us online. There wasn't any giant company behind Bitcoin, and we have people who flew in from all over the world at this conference.  CoinDesk: What percentage of transactions will happen in bitcoins?  Ver: I think we'll see a higher and higher percentage of transactions online happen in bitcoin. Offline will happen later, if ever. ... I don't know any supermarkets or gas stations that accept PayPal.  CoinDesk: Did you invest so much in Bitcoin because you know it will pay off, or for philosophical reasons?  Ver: It's for philosophical reasons. I could have been retired and had a nice life already at that point. I could have chosen not to rock the boat and had a wonderful time in Japan. I found Bitcoin (two-and-a-half years ago) and it was like I found my calling in life ... It's this incredibly powerful tool that's not going to (just) free Americans, it's going to free every country on the planet ... I've been shouting from the rooftops.  If I lose every penny that I put into bitcoin -- let's say Bitcoin 2.0 comes along and I lose everything that I put in, but the world has more freedom and people finally have control of their own money, I'm happy. If all that happens, and I make a lot of money along the way, I'm happier.  CoinDesk: The Bitcoin Foundation advises against putting your life savings in bitcoins, but you have done just that. Why do you feel safe doing that?  Ver: Because at this point it has a four-and-a-half-year track record without a catastrophic problem with the Bitcoin protocol itself that wasn't quickly resolved. At this point, I don't think there are going to be any more in the future. In the next couple months we may hear (Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist) Gavin (Andreson) change his tune.  CoinDesk: Have any of your investments in Bitcoin companies paid off so far?  Ver: On paper.  CoinDesk: What is the affinity between people like libertarians and voluntarists, and Bitcoin?  Ver: Bitcoin is a financial system that can't be affected, altered or changed at the point of a gun. Because I'm opposed to violence, I'm in favor of Bitcoin ... The US military is busy killing people all over the world. I'm not interested in killing anybody. The vast majority of that war machine isn't paid for by taxation, it's paid for by inflation. (By transacting in bitcoins, Ver reasons, people can take away the government's power to print more money with which to make war.)  CoinDesk: How did you feel about the US government action against Mutum Sigillum?  Ver: I wish more people would pay attention because the US government claims to protect consumers and that's why they claim to do this kind of thing. They came in and stole Mt. Gox's Dwolla account with several million of their customers' money in it. If the government claims to protect consumers, why are they stealing this money? ... The money that was taken was Mt. Gox's customers' money.  CoinDesk: Did it surprise you?  Ver: I couldn't have predicted the exact day. The fact that it happened right before the conference was interesting ... There's no direct proof that they were trying to put out some negative press right before the biggest Bitcoin conference that's ever happened, but the timing is interesting.  CoinDesk: Was it a blow to Bitcoin?  Ver: No. The price didn't move at all, and people are more excited about Bitcoin than ever. The more governments try to attack and control Bitcoin, the more attention it will get. If governments start attacking, more people are going to hear about it and realize it's in their best interest to use it.  CoinDesk: Is there any role at all for government when it comes to regulating Bitcoin?  Ver: I'm in favor of regulation. I'm not in favor of regulation at the point of a gun. That's a really important difference. When the regulators from Washington, DC, make a law they're not asking you to do that. They're telling you to do that. The difference between asking someone and telling someone to do something is fundamental. It's the same as the difference between making love and being raped. (Every law comes with the implicit threat that it will be enforced at gunpoint if necessary, Ver believes.)  There could be all sorts of private industry groups that could make recommendations, and these businesses can choose whether they want to participate, and nobody's going to be threatening anyone with violence.  CoinDesk: What will it take before Bitcoin can become truly mainstream?  Ver: All these really smart software programmers (like the ones who were at this conference) need to build the software that makes it really easy for your Grandma to use Bitcoin safely. (That's a year or two out, Ver says.) We need it to be incredibly easy for people to get traditional currencies in and out of bitcoin, so the exchange markets need to develop a lot more as well. More than 1,000 people here are really hard at work on that. Lots of really smart people are working on this.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/20/coindesk-talks-with-roger-ver-bitcoin-jesus-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0c673b354fe61afd1f22b7ce0709d333b9db91e-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ai6r,1369049222,Has Ted Nelson named the real Satoshi Nakamoto?,"The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery, but Ted Nelson has thrown another hat into the ring.  In a slightly weird twilight video, Nelson plays Sherlock Holmes to find his candidate. Nelson is not just another random YouTuber - his 1960 Xanadu project laid some of the foundations for hyperlinks.  He suggests we look at the behaviour of Satoshi in avoiding traditional academic research or to engage once he released Bitcoin into the wild in 2009.  We must then look for someone behaving in a similar way - and Nelson believes he has found the man - a Japanese mathematician Professor Shinichi Mochizuki. Evidence for this is, as Nelson himself admits, a little circumstantial. It rests on how Professor Mochizuki released his solution to the ABC Conjecture - considered one mathematics greatest unsolved problems.  Mochizuki put his 500 page solution on his website in August 2012 and mathematicians are still in the process of checking it. The solution took four years to find and may take longer to check because it is effectively a new branch of mathematics. It amazed the world of maths and soon hit the mainstream media too.  Mochizuki declined to discuss his theory and in Nelson's words 'tiptoed away and not deigning to discuss.' He was asked to lecture on it but refused.  This MO, the theory goes, is so similar to that of Satoshi in releasing Bitcoin then falling into radio silence that they must in fact be the same person - a brilliant mathematician who refuses to engage with the academic community.  But several people object that Satoshi was culturally a cypherpunk not a corduroy-clad academic. Many are certain Satoshi was involved in the cryptography sub-culture of the late 1990s and that Bitcoin brings together not just aspects of that technology but also much of that culture. Nelson's video also points out that Conan-Doyle knew the answers before providing a supposed way to deduce the answer.  ""That is how Sherlock Holmes would do it - look for the pattern aided by an author who already knew the answer."" - Ted Nelson  So maybe Nelson is telling us he knows the answer from another source.  Nelson also explains why he is revealing the identity of someone who wishes to remain anonymous - because he will be revealed eventually and Nelson would like to get credit for a change. Secondly Nelson said Mochizuki and his university deserve the credit he, or they, may be too shy to seek.  Thirdly he wants him to get the Nobel Prize for Economics.  And finally he asks him to turn his ""great and all-seeing mind"" to ""the compelling and less abstract problems of mankind - nuclear weapons, terrorism or pollution perhaps.""  There are of course other candidates – Satoshi is Finnish?  This way for Professor Mochizuki’s website.  Read the CoinDesk guide for more information - Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?  The Bitcoin Talk forum thread is here.  Update Sep 2014: Ted Nelson has produced a new video: How Bitcoin Actually Works.

42376464,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ai1p,1369041930,Bitcoin 2013 in review,"Walking into the San Jose Convention Center this weekend, at first you might mistake the crowd for just another programming conference. Almost all-male attendance, mostly wearing open-collared shirts with jeans or khakis, with the occasional Tshirt. But then, you'd catch the wild glimmer in an eye, or a vintage hat, or a head of wild long hair, and you would realize that while this was a technically sophisticated crowd, this was no mere programming conference. The more than 1,000 Bitcoin enthusiasts who converged on San Jose were an impassioned bunch -- some fired with the excitement of getting in on something big the ground floor, others lit up by a more ideological passion for freedom from government or from the existing financial system.  They came, they swapped stories of working for bitcoins and sought advice on getting their first round of venture funding. They learned from the first round of Bitcoin entrepreneurs, who in turn expressed amazement at being surrounded by over a thousand peers, when just a couple years ago they'd felt like they were alone in the wilderness.  A few of the most interesting points that came up over the weekend:  Bitcoin companies must take regulatory compliance seriously. Nothing could have underlined that more emphatically than the seizure of Mt. Gox funds just before the show began, and a panel of attorneys and Bitcoin startup veterans newer entrepreneurs grasp what steps they'll need to take to become compliant.  More and more goods and services can be purchased with bitcoins. Throughout the weekend, attendees and presenters shared that they had purchased or sold travel, lodging, cupcakes and electronics for bitcoins, or accepted bitcoin donations to their charities. On the show floor, attendees bought magazines, Tshirts and other goodies using bitcoins from their digital wallets. Or if they hadn't brought their bitcoins, they fed $20 bills into Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures' ATM and got some.  Mainstream investors have heard of Bitcoin. At one panel, funded entrepreneurs shared how presentations used to begin with an explanation of what the cryptocurrency is -- but not now.  Bitcoin can be fun. From the presentation titles, you'd think that the Bitcoin investor or enthusiast thinks only about getting rich or achieving total liberty for all humans, with no time for anything so fanciful as joking around or dancing. Not so. Throughout the two days' programs, attendees heard a band calling itself Zhou Tonged sing their love for Bitcoin both in rap style and the vintage rock sounds of Billy Joel (they want to hold their bitcoins for the longest time); chatted with models advertising NEFT brand vodka, which made its US debut at the show, and watched the trailer for the upcoming Bitcoin documentary. Judging from the demand for water bottles and coffee at Sunday morning panels, there may have even been some fun times after hours at the conference.  Despite all the talk of buying, selling and spending bitcoins, when asked what they do with their bitcoins, the most common answer from all attendees was: ""Hold them."" Many attendees said they made an effort to spend bitcoins whenever possible to support the nascent economy and to promote bitcoins -- but many said they immediately bought new bitcoins to replace the ones they'd spent, so as not to reduce their holdings.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/20/bitcoin-2013-in-review,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a190efcd376291f16b9a1b970bacb3ff396a9e5e-628x315.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376473,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AiD9,1369041618,"Coinlab, BitPay, Coinbase, BitInstant execs offer startup how-tos #Bitcoin2013","What's life like for a bitcoin startup? A panel of entrepreneurs -- including Peter Vessenes, founder and CEO of Coinlab; Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase; Anthony Gallippi, co-founder and CEO of BitPay; and Charlie Shrem, co-founder and CEO of BitInstant -- tackled that topic during a panel discussion Sunday at Bitcoin 2013.  Part how-to on getting early-stage investors, part peek into the life of bitcoin business, the conversation was moderated by Mark Edge, a host with the call-in radio show Free Talk Live.  The audience was about one-third entrepreneurs hoping to get funding, with a few would-be investors scattered about here and there. The entrepreneurs on the panel, all of whom got started when most potential investors had never heard of Bitcoin, expressed a bit of envy and wonder at the idea that they were, just a few years later, in a room packed full of people who wanted to invest their time and money in the cryptocurrency.  All the panelists warned would-be entrepreneurs not to spend too much of their time and energy pursuing funding at the expense of working on their product.  ""It's very easy, especially in the early days when you have very little manpower, to get wrapped up in a bunch of meetings,"" Ehrsam said. ""At the end of the day, you have to make a product that people want to use.""  ""Every hour that you spend working on term sheets and [with] the banks ... is time you can't spend working on your product,"" Gallippi added, noting that BitPay was self-funded for the first 18 months of its existence.  Vessenes said that, in hindsight, he believes he spent too much time thinking about how to calm down potential investors about Bitcoin's potential risks. He should have spent more time focusing on what he really wanted to do, he said.  The hype that comes along with a major funding announcement can also be distracting, Shrem pointed out. That's why BitInstant put off announcing the funding it raised last fall until just a few days ago, he said.  Raising money for the first time can be nerve-wracking, Shrem added.  ""[BitInstant] is my second startup,"" he said. ""My first startup, we didn't really raise money. As I'm on the phone with VCs and they're spewing all these [financial] words, I'm Googling what these things are.""  He continued, ""At first there was no money in the Bitcoin space, it was really hard to raise money. I literally had to get the first $10,000 from my mother to start BitInstant. What I tell any startup, especially in the Bitcoin space, when there's money coming at you, take a day or two [to think about it before accepting] ... It's kind of like a marriage on steroids.""  Early investors often put more than money into a young company -- they can also be valuable mentors, Vessenes said.  ""I have time and attention from people who are much more experienced than me,"" he said. ""Any fundraising you're doing is buying attention from rich people that are successful.""  One important prerequisite to getting funding for a Bitcoin company is to have the technical expertise to build the product; so entrepreneurs who don't have the technical chops themselves should partner with someone who does, the panelists advised.  On the heels of that advice, Shrem revealed he has never met his ""super genius"" co-founder and CTO Gareth Nelson in person. They met online.  ""That's insane!"" Ehrsam burst out. ""But kind of awesome.""  One audience member asked what kinds of ideas new Bitcoin entrepreneurs should be exploring. The panelists urged entrepreneurs not to start ""me-too"" companies that duplicate ideas that already exist.  ""Between now and next year at this conference, some totally new idea will have made someone $50 million, and we'll see 10 of those me-toos come along,"" Vessenes said.  To find that next great company, Ehrsam suggested, entrepreneurs should be ""looking at how Bitcoin can solve major pain points in the global economy.""  Among some of the panel's other suggestions: Build an SMS service so people can quickly convert their savings into bitcoins when their local currency is spiraling down, build an app to quickly access paid online content, and find a way to facilitate remittances to help overseas workers send money home to their families.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/20/coinlab-bitpay-coinbase-bitinstant-execs-offer-startup-how-tos-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b689ab1a212905a4a844a15c953b20764cc42bca-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Lamassu's machine is a small, glossy white box about the size of a microwave oven, with a slot to accept bills, a screen and a camera that can read QR codes from a user's wallet app on a smartphone screen.  Attendee Evan Rose fed two $20 bills into the machine and saw the bitcoins hit his digital wallet within seconds.  ""There goes my cab fare,"" he joked.  ""Convince your cab driver to accept bitcoin,"" advised Matt Whitlock, one of the company's three co-founders.  The trio plans to sell the machines for $4,000 each to wholesale distributors, and suggest a $5,000 retail price. Then machine owners can operate the machines independently, setting their own fee structure, Rose said.  The RoboCoin Kiosk, a much larger machine the size of an arcade game, was powered down and unattended Saturday afternoon.

42395337,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASkVCY,1369041177,Tuur Demeester: Bitcoin still a great investment #Bitcoin2013,"Tuur Demeester  -- publisher of the Dutch-language investment newsletter MacroTrends -- began advising his readers to buy bitcoins back when the currency was trading at just $5 (US) per BTC. But even at today's prices ($120.50 as of mid-day on May 19), he says he believes Bitcoin remains a very good investment.  The current high price is not a bubble, Demeester asserts. He points to the fact that past price peaks -- despite having sometimes been followed by steep drops -- have now been surpassed.  ""Obviously there is something wrong with this idea that Bitcoin would be what is traditionally considered a bubble,"" he says.  Because cryptocurrency is a technology, Demeester expects Bitcoin's adoption to follow the typical S-curve seen in other new technologies. In fact, he notes, that is what we are seeing so far.  ""This parabolic rise in price we're seeing over time shouldn't really surprise us,"" he says.  The price fluctuations are scary only to the uninformed investor, Demeester says. He dismisses fear of perpetual volatility as unfounded.  Demeester reasons that it's the youth of the fast-rising market attracting speculators that cause price gyrations during this stage. Another short-term cause of today's volatility, he adds, is that the fledgling companies providing Bitcoin services are not yet prepared for sudden increases in volume. These technical hiccups can cause price drops now, he says, but they won't be a perpetual issue.  ""The Bitcoin economy as a whole is growing and we are seeing the embryonic start of a financial system in itself,"" Demeester says. ""For the investor, that means in the future you'll be very likely to ... buy commodities, futures and shares with bitcoin.""  This will make holding bitcoins as an investment much more practical, he says.  After all, Demeester says, bitcoin is a new commodity. He looks back to other instances when a new commodity -- petroleum, for example -- was introduced to the world market. Showing a graph of oil prices beginning in 1860, he points out how petroleum prices gyrated wildly in the first decades of trading, before settling into a more regular pattern.  Although he expects the Bitcoin market to stabilize over time like petroleum did, Demeester doesn't expect the digital currency to follow an exactly parallel path. The reason he gives? Oil, he says, has become more plentiful over the years, but bitcoin's supply is forever limited.  That's just one reason Demeester recommends that all investors should hold at least a few bitcoins.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/20/tuur-demeester-bitcoin-still-a-great-investment-bitcoin2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90f7c6ff9cad8df9ec82da4a8e1226e17b2fa777-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
