Here’s What Analysts Think,"Terra&apos;s LUNA has been trending to the downside in the past few days, but different indicators show interesting signs and the next price movements could be fundamental to confirm either an extremely bullish or a bearish signal. Related Reading | LUNA Sees 17% Loss In One Week, UST De-Peg Rumors Affect Its Price? What Is Boiling Up In LUNA&apos;s Weekly Timeframe? When an anonymous trader used Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to analyze LUNA&apos;s next possible movements, the weekly chart showed an interesting crossover. &apos;Something is up on $LUNA weekly timeframe. Last time the MACD crossover occured it sent $LUNA from $12 to $106.&apos; A MACD crossover can give a bullish signal when the MACD (see the blue line in the chart below) rises above the signal line (see the yellow line). The opposite crossover would give a bearish signal, which can also be seen below in previous months as an example. Another pseudonym trader noted that multiple time frames are looking good for the digital coin, which they think could be because a result of &apos;the massive amount of BTC being bought to help support stable UST or it could be that the whole market is bubbling up&apos; &apos;1 hour pointing upwards, 4 and 6 hours are about to print bullish twist above the cloud (max bull signal in my mind), 12 hour and daily charts look happy enough and will likely look even nicer as Luna presses to all time highs....",POSITIVE,BTC | LUNA,BTC | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/terra-luna/luna-to-spike-80-heres-what-analysts-think/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42395746,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz9UN,1647988281,First Mover Asia: Part of Singapore’s Crypto Allure Is a Sheen of Transparency. Is the City-State Changing?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin soars past $43,000 before retrenching but was still up for the day.  Insights: The reasons for a Singapore regulator's decision to place crypto fund DeFiance Capital on an ""Investor Alert List"" was unclear.  Technician's take: Momentum is turning bullish over the short term.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,725 +3.5%  Ether (ETH): $3,011 +3.2%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC +20.3% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin Cash BCH +12.7% Currency Cardano ADA +8.4% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos are in the green  Bitcoin leaped past $43,000 before retrenching well under this mark, but was still recently up nearly 4% over the previous 24 hours. Ether soared past $3,000 for the first time in two weeks, a more than 3% gain, and most other major altcoins in the CoinDesk top 20 by market capitalization were well into the green.  Bitcoin was changing hands at about $42,700. Cardano's ADA and Polkadot's DOT rose over 7% at certain points. Axie Infinity token AXS and shiba inu (SHIB) were up over 5% and 3%, respectively.  CoinDesk's Market Wrap on Tuesday noted that some analysts have approached the spike in prices with caution because of uncertainty about the appetite for risk.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Mark Chandler, managing director and chief market strategist for capital markets trading firm Bannockburn Global Forex, said that more hawkish monetary policy could hurt crypto in the long term. “Crypto is acting more like a risk asset than an inflation protection,” he said.  But in the short term, Chandler attributed crypto's rise the past few days to improvement in equity markets, particularly the Nasdaq. ""That is a kind of rally that risk assets like and that's why crypto is primarily rallying,"" Chandler said.  The tech-focused Nasdaq jumped nearly 2% on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 rose 1.1%  Chandler said ether had been outperforming bitcoin because investors have been intrigued by a number of projects that promise ""to increase the efficiency and reduce its carbon footprint. That might be attracting some money and help explain why ether is doing better than bitcoin.""  But he said he was also concerned the U.S. central bank would not be able ""to engineer a soft landing"" that brings down inflation without recession. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates 25 basis points last week as was widely expected to combat rising inflation, and on Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested in a speech that future increases this year could come in 50-basis point increments.  Chandler noted the Fed had ""revised growth down, inflation higher, interest rates higher"" but not unemployment. ""Many people are going to be surprised that we do not get a rise in unemployment.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,511 +1.1%  DJIA: 34,807 +0.7%  Nasdaq: 14,108 +1.8%  Gold: $1,920 -.2%  Insights  Singapore loses some transparency  Singapore has been celebrated as crypto’s natural home in Asia.  Its judiciary and regulators are fair, quick and efficient, the air is clean and the population speaks English fluently. Its strongman founder, Lee Kuan Yew, believed that prosperous nations are ones where the rich aren’t above the law; civil servants are handsomely paid to help ensure they are immune to bribes. Judges must rule on commercial disputes citing case law, not thinking about favors and connections.  But a strange thing happened this week in Singapore’s crypto scene. DeFiance Capital, one of the many crypto funds registered in the city, was put on an ""Investor Alert List"" by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the central bank and regulator.  “The Investor Alert List provides a list of unregulated persons who, based on information received by MAS, may have been wrongly perceived as being licensed or regulated by MAS,” is how MAS describes it.  MAS didn’t respond to a CoinDesk query to provide a detailed explanation of why DeFiance Capital was placed on the list and not any of its peers, such as Three Arrows Capital, that are registered in the city.  DeFiance Capital told CoinDesk that “inclusion on the IAL carries no implication of legal impropriety but simply indicates that DeFiance Capital, like many other crypto-native VCs in Singapore, are not yet regulated by MAS.”  But DeFiance Capital is also unsure what happened.  “We are currently trying to understand how this issue came about. Prior to this we were proactively working with MAS to communicate our operations in Singapore,” the fund said in an email to CoinDesk, noting that its investment activities and operations remain unaffected.  Although being on this list doesn’t signify any sort of wrongdoing, that might be lost on casual observers when they see a fund’s name – and not that of its peers – on an “alert list.”  For Singapore, this is surprising. The entire place differentiates itself from its peers by the transparency of its regulatory process. Regulatory black holes, where things are considered on a whim or royal fiat and not explained, are for other countries, not a place vying to be Asia’s dominant financial hub.     Technician's take  Bitcoin Rises Above $42K; Resistance at $46K-$50K  Bitcoin (BTC) is holding support above $40,000 as short-term momentum signals improve. For now, pullbacks appear to be limited, which means buyers could remain active toward the $46,000-$50,000 resistance zone.  The cryptocurrency is up 4% over the past 24 hours and is attempting to establish a higher price range on the charts.  A decisive breakout above $46,000 is needed to shift the four-month-long downtrend. Typically, price rallies stall after retracing 50% of the prior down move, similar to what occurred in September 2021 around the $50,000 price level.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart remains in bullish territory (above 50), indicating renewed buying activity. On the weekly chart, momentum indicators are on the verge of turning positive for the first time since August, which preceded a strong price rally.  Still, a bearish set-up remains on the monthly chart, which means upside could be limited.

The offering was initially scheduled to take place between March 15-20, but the Russia-Ukraine war and the war's impact on the price of bitcoin caused the government to change the date, according to Reuters.

""In May and June sometimes you can, but the market variables get different. After September, it is difficult to raise, unless you are previously funded, as in the case of bitcoin bond,"" he added.

Half the funds will be used to accumulate bitcoin (BTC), with the rest earmarked for infrastructure and bitcoin mining powered by geothermal energy.

As NewsBTC has been reporting, Bitcoin seems to be reacting to the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) shift in monetary policy and the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The financial institution announced a rate hike of 25 basic points (bps) for the coming months. This increment meets market expectations. No major announcement is expected from the FED in the short term. As for the armed conflict, attempts to reach a diplomatic solution have failed, with no clear winner on the battlefield. The parties seem to be at a stalemate. This tense calm has moved to the market and the uncertainty could lead Bitcoin into further consolidation between its current levels, and the high area around $30,000. In support of this thesis, Arcane Research records no major movements in Open Interest (OI) for the BTC-based derivatives sector. This metric has remained stable at around 360,000 BTC and 380,000 BTC since the start of 2022.

42395754,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz9eD,1647981948,Fed Chair Powell’s Hawkish Stance on Inflation Could Hurt Crypto,"It’s been almost a week since the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it would raise interest rates for the first time in more than three years, and bitcoin (BTC) is still trading above the $40,000 mark.  That resilience might get battle-tested if the Fed sticks to its plans to stay hawkish until inflation is tamed, analysts say.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap clearly reacted positively to the Fed’s March decision, suggesting that some traders use bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and rising prices.  Even after a speech this week by Fed Chair Jerome Powell that was seen as one of his most hawkish yet, BTC is still up 8% from a week ago, currently changing hands at $42,524.50. Powell told the National Association for Business Economics on Monday that there was an obvious need to “move expeditiously” to get monetary policy back to a more “neutral level.”  But looking ahead, the Fed’s hawkish stance could push down crypto prices, just like it will likely hurt equity markets.  “Crypto is acting more like a risk asset than an inflation protection,” Marc Chandler, Bannockburn Global Forex managing director and chief market strategist, said Tuesday on CoinDesk TV.  In the last couple of months, bitcoin has moved strongly in correlation with traditional stock markets, and it is down nearly 30% over the last year while inflation has surged to a four-decade high.  The Fed’s quarterly economic projections and its “dot plot” show that the median forecast of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for the Federal Funds Rate is 2.38% for the long term, which is what the Fed believes is the “neutral” rate, a rate that would neither stimulate not restrain economic growth.  For 2022 and 2023, however, the Fed officials expect the rate to be at 2.75%, suggesting that they’re willing to go above what they perceive to be neutral in order to rein in inflation next year.  “If this forecast comes to pass, they’re going to lean on the markets; they’re going to want people to lose money,” said James A. Bianco, president and macro strategist at Bianco Research. “Will that hurt crypto markets and risk markets like stocks? Yes, and that’s part of the plan. They don’t want it to crash, they just want it to slow down.”  For a long time, economists have argued that the central bank’s main priority was economic growth, as in maximizing employment.  The focus has changed in the last year as the Fed “widely underestimated” inflationary pressures, as Powell admitted. As of now, inflation is of top concern, even if it hurts the market.  As more mainstream institutional money flows into crypto, there’s increased linkage to traditional financial markets. This makes crypto trade more in correlation with the stock market than it has before.  “I think a fundamental problem is widespread institutional adoption,” Bianco said. “It is going to struggle because the Fed is going to lean on the traditional financial markets to kill inflation, and all of these institutions … are probably going to sell it, just like they’re probably going to eventually sell their stocks if that forecast is correct.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/22/fed-chair-powells-hawkish-stance-on-inflation-could-hurt-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93220b9a009173ccc154f9a5023542626072d8c6-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round, first reported to be in the works back in February, values the company at $4 billion.  The official announcement of the funding caps off what has been a monumental two weeks for Yuga Labs.

Some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) also edged higher on Tuesday, even as alts' recent gains against bitcoin were starting to fade. For example, ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin, rose above $3,000 for the first time in two weeks and was up 3% over the past 24 hours, compared to a rise of as much as 4% in BTC over the same period. Meanwhile, Terra's LUNA token was down 3% over the past 24 hours.  But some analysts remain cautious despite the recent price rise. ""This is not the first such jump in BTC since the beginning of March, in contrast to the neutral or even negative sentiment in the stock markets,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an article. ""Until now, such impulses cannot be on a solid basis, because the fundamental demand for risks is under obvious pressure.""  Elsewhere, global equities traded higher on Monday while gold, a traditional safe haven, declined. The 10-year Treasury bond yield continued higher, tracking gains in oil prices as investors position themselves for high inflation and rising interest rates.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Tactical shift in altcoins  Is ""altcoin season"" making a comeback? Not quite.  For now, some analysts see the potential for a short-term relief rally in altcoins, which could signal a greater appetite for risk among crypto investors. Altcoins tend to outperform in bull markets because of their higher risk profile relative to bitcoin.  The chart below shows the cycle in bitcoin and altcoins over the past year. When Glassnode's risk indicators reach extreme highs, a greater allocation to bitcoin is warranted, similar to what occurred earlier this year. In contrast, when risk is low for an extended period of time, traders tend to shift toward altcoins as sentiment improves.  Currently, the risk signal (see last panel below) is still above 25, which does not suggest an aggressive rotation to altcoins. Read more here.  And here is the Altcoin Season Index by Blockchain Center. So far, roughly 25% of the top 50 coins are performing better than bitcoin over the past 90 days, which is below the 75% threshold to signal a bullish phase for altcoins (possibly too late for traders looking for a new trend).  Instead, based on previous cycles, altcoins tend to sustain their outperformance once the indicator crosses above the 50% neutral mark.  Crypto stocks race ahead  Another indicator of investor appetite for risk is the performance of crypto-related stocks relative to BTC.  The chart below shows the recent outperformance of the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators exchange-traded fund (BITQ), which tracks the performance of companies that generate the majority of their revenue from their crypto business activities. BITQ is now ahead of BTC over the past 30 days, which typically signals a bullish turn in crypto markets.

42422855,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qTzh,1647979898,"Mango DAO Embraces SOL, Rejects BTC With $1M Treasury Investment","Mango DAO, the governing body for Solana-based crypto trading hub Mango Markets, on Tuesday approved a $1 million treasury investment in Solana-linked tokens just hours after overwhelmingly rejecting calls to do the same for bitcoin.  Mango DAO’s nearly $700 million treasury will now diversify beyond USDC stablecoins for the first time. And it will do so not in bitcoin – the eponymous crypto asset that software company MicroStrategy made famous as a treasury reserve – but in mSOL, a token tied to SOL that pays out staking rewards.  Mango Markets is a borrowing, lending and trading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on Solana. Its Mango DAO governing body is one of Solanaland’s more built-out decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). MNGO token holders vote on everything from token listings to party funding; they also oversee Mango’s hulking treasury, which is funded through trading fees.  Plenty of DAOs have embarked on treasury diversification campaigns before. There have been governance token fire sales and partnerships with investment managers. More rare is the up-or-down community vote to swap stablecoins for volatile assets like solana.  Brian Smith, a Mango DAO contributor who helped spearhead the treasury proposals, told CoinDesk the mSOL proposal was successful because it “hedges out some of the future price risk” that Mango Markets incurs by operating its trading rails with SOL. Plus, mSOL, the Marinade Finance-issued liquid staking token, offers the benefit of staking yield.  “We were holding 100% USDC and not earning any interest on that capital,” he said in a Telegram message.  Smith is now tasked with executing the mSOL purchase via a delegated account that he said Mango set up.  DAOs dabbling in bitcoin  MNGO holders’ strong rejection of bitcoin (that vote ended with 99.5% against) stands in contrast to recent pro-BTC movements elsewhere in the crypto-sphere.  Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs and the chief figurehead of the Terra blockchain, is barnstorming a plan to backstop Terra’s UST stablecoin with up to $10 billion in bitcoin.  As of Tuesday, that is decidedly not the path for Mango.  “The people have spoken and no one wants BTC,” Smith wrote on Mango’s Discord channel Monday after the bitcoin proposal went down in flames. “Only 26k yes votes has got to be the least support for any serious proposal in Mango DAO’s history.”  Read more: Terra's LUNA Jumps 15% as UST Stablecoin Gets $1B Bitcoin Reserve  Part of the community's wariness with bitcoin was the security risks of buying a wrapped asset, Smith said. And the version of bitcoin they would have to buy will soon lose support on Solana, he said. Plus, there’s the optics: “Some people may not think BTC is a good fit for a Solana DAO.”  Still, there were signs Tuesday that Mango voters might come around to investing in bitcoin. Some members of the project’s Discord said mSOL was a more practical test case for Mango’s first treasury diversification vote than bitcoin. Mango co-founder Daffy Durairaj advocated for going with mSOL first.  Operating decentralized governance can be a challenge for Solana-based projects. Despite its growing prominence in DeFi circles, Solana has nowhere near as much DAO activity as Ethereum does. That’s partly because it lacks the governance infrastructure that Ethereum projects have.  But that’s beginning to change, Smith said.  “Solana governance tools are being developed at a fast rate [with a lot of contributions from the Mango developer team], and I’m hopeful governance become much more effective in the future,"" he said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | LUNA | SOL,BTC | LUNA | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/22/mango-dao-embraces-sol-rejects-btc-with-1m-treasury-investment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4d8026a87f34d5dcfe3733dc61fd09860210e40-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Axios previously reported the news.  The funds included $500 million for an early-stage fund and $1 billion for an acceleration fund, amounts that are noteworthy for a new fund set up by a single person.  Backing came from a16z and some of that firm’s individual partners, as well as from university endowments, charitable foundations and family offices, according to Axios.  Haun, who spent more than 10 years as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice, told Axios that Haun Ventures will seek to become a registered investment advisor (RIA), which would remove caps on the amount of capital that can be used for token purchases. A16z and Sequoia Capital both went the RIA route with their firms.  “We’re energized by the opportunity to invest in every layer of the web3 tech stack, and will back projects in their early stages as well as when they are ready to accelerate growth,” Haun said in her post.  Haun, who sits on the boards of crypto exchange Coinbase and NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace OpenSea, announced in December she would be leaving a16z to start her own firm focused on crypto and Web 3.

It would effectively ban PoW mining – the energy-intensive process used to secure the Bitcoin (BTC) network – for a period of two years.

The non-fungible charade is a part of the rollout for Kiesza’s new record, “Tommy,” which is set to release shortly after the episode airs.  During the set, the characters will perform what the project calls “Meta Moves,” which are interoperable dance emotes, or moves, that pay royalties to their creators, according to a press release.  In the push for mainstream NFT adoption, talk show television has done its fair share of promotion for the technology as a cultural phenomenon.  DeGeneres first discussed NFTs on her show in April 2021 in a Dogecoin-themed interview with billionaire investor and crypto enthusiast Mark Cuban. The famed talk show host would go on to auction off a hand-drawn NFT of her own later in the show, which ultimately sold for $33,500.

Earlier in March, it was announced that music artist Ape Rave Club would be headlining the Tomorrowland music festival, which will be the first time an “NFT artist” performs live at a music festival.  The Milkyway Pirates collection received seed investment from QGlobe, a metaverse and Web 3 accelerator program.  “The Milkyway Pirates is an ambitious project that aims to set world records to innovate in music, blockchain, and space exploration,” Kiesza said in a press release. “Funding aside, [QGlobe’s] metaverse and Web 3 backgrounds have turned this project into a serious contender.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/22/nfts-are-on-ellen-this-time-as-performers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a4f2732256b9de4d133bd2a9542fe8afc17905e-3000x2069.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Good Luck Games will be integrated into FTX Gaming following the acquisition.  News broke last month that FTX was launching a gaming unit to encourage game publishers to adopt cryptocurrencies through a “crypto-as-a-service” platform.  Founded in 2019, Olympia, Washington-based Good Luck Games is led by four veteran card game designers and former professional players with ties to games Magic: The Gathering and The Elder Scrolls: Legends.  Storybook Brawl, currently in early access on Steam, is a card-based auto-battler game featuring fairytale and mythical characters. The game is designed to be simple to play, but the wide variety of cards also allow for more strategic game play and the possibility of creating blockchain-backed digital game assets.  The mobile version of Storybook Brawl is expected to launch this summer.  “We're excited to explore what the intersection of [non-fungible tokens], crypto, blockchain and gaming looks like. But we're even more excited to see where Storybook goes,” FTX CEO and co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried wrote on Twitter, revealing he has known the Good Luck Games team since middle school. “Our mission is to help them build the best games they can – with as much (or little!) integration with FTX as they want.”  Gamers haven’t reacted well in the past to the integration of blockchain-based features in traditional games.

Ava Labs is the team supporting the development of the Avalanche blockchain.  “Core is not just a wallet. It’s a curated Web3 operating system that combines secure wallet architecture with technology not found in any other wallet,” said Mussallem in a statement. It comes shortly after ConsenSys – the parent company of wallet incumbent MetaMask (through which many users interact with Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains like Avalanche) – snagged a $7 billion valuation in its latest funding round.  The Core wallet will incorporate native Avalanche bridging functionality, which enables users of the wallet to directly interact with decentralized applications (dapps) on the Avalanche blockchain. Previously, users of MetaMask had to use an Ethereum-Avalanche bridge in order to move their assets onto the Avalanche blockchain.  Bridges are applications that help users move assets from one blockchain to another, a process that is often complicated and prone to hacks.  As decentralized finance (DeFi) usage has grown on Avalanche, the Avalanche Bridge has become the most popular Ethereum-connected bridge with over $6 billion in total valued locked (TVL). According to Avalanche, the bridge has facilitated the usage of over $43 billion in assets between Avalanche and Ethereum since its launch in July 2021.  Wallet wars  The new wallet is also expected to cater to a growing number of Avalanche power users who are looking for an Avalanche-native user experience.  The first phase of the launch involves rolling out the Core browser extension in late March. The second phase will include launching the Core mobile application early in the second quarter.  Furthermore, Avalanche announced that the existing Avalanche Bridge will support Bitcoin in early Q2, onboarding the largest cryptocurrency by market cap into the Avalanche DeFi ecosystem.  Previously, users looking to move their bitcoin onto Avalanche would have to wrap the bitcoin using third-party wrapping services like WBTC or renBTC.  Avalanche project leads say they are looking to support a growing number of blockchains using bridging infrastructure.  AVAX, the native asset of the Avalanche blockchain, was flat at $86 over the past 24 hours.

Lemonade (LMND), a $1.7 billion market cap company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is rolling out a newly created decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called the Lemonade Crypto Climate Coalition.  Administered by the Lemonade Foundation, the project includes representatives from the Avalanche blockchain; Chainlink, which provide real-world data to blockchains; DAOstack, a creator of DAO software stacks; Etherisc, a builder of decentralized insurance apps; Hannover Re, a German reinsurance company; Pula, an agricultural insurance startup; and Tomorrow.io, a provider of real-time weather information.  The new project, which will be formally introduced on Wednesday at the Avalanche Summit in Barcelona, Spain, marks Lemonade’s entry into blockchain-based insurance with a prosocial focus on farmers in emerging markets.  “By using a DAO instead of a traditional insurance company, smart contracts instead of insurance policies and oracles instead of claims professionals, we expect to harness the communal and decentralized aspects of Web 3 and real-time weather data to deliver affordable and instantaneous climate insurance to the people who need it most,” Lemonade Foundation director Daniel Schreiber said in a statement.  A spokesperson for Lemonade confirmed this is the firm’s first Web 3 experiment.  The insurance program will be accepting stablecoin or local currency payments from farmers through a decentralized application on the Avalanche blockchain. An initial rollout in Africa is expected within the year, with flood insurance in Nigeria expected to be an initial offering, according to a person involved in the project.  “It’s fully permissionless,” Chainlink Labs Managing Director William Herkelrath told CoinDesk. “Each insurance contract has a specific condition and is monitored separately by node operators for the occurrence of conditions.”  Read more: AccuWeather Taps Chainlink to Explore Crop Insurance and More  So far, insurance protocols represent a relatively niche application of blockchain technology, but many proponents of insurance protocols say it can revolutionize a trillion-dollar industry that is often plagued by slow payouts and disputes between counterparties.  “Anytime you need fast results and transparency, where information and value are flowing simultaneously, Avalanche is the best solution,” John Wu, president of Ava Labs, told CoinDesk on the sidelines of the Avalanche conference in Barcelona.

42411471,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONS9,1647973424,The Ramps Killing Bitcoin's Dissident Thesis,"Crypto is marketed by its fans as an unstoppable dissident technology and feared by governments for its subversiveness. But the many shortcomings of a recent bitcoin fundraiser to support an illegal Ottawa, Ontario, trucker convoy (more on that later) suggests that crypto isn't as unstoppable or subversive as it is often made out to be.  But if Ottawa contradicts the standard crypto narrative, we also have an example that confirms it. Waves of successful Russian ransomware attacks relying on the Bitcoin network to extract ransom payments suggest that crypto is an incredibly effective technology for evading rules.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  So which is it: unstoppable or not? The short answer: It depends on the off-ramps and on-ramps. Let's explore why crypto was a dud in Canada, but is highly successful for Russian ransomware operators.  What crypto brings to the table is the ability for two people to make a digital peer-to-peer transfer that cannot be preempted by a third party. But a peer-to-peer crypto transfer is only the middle step in a three-step circuit that begins with on-ramping into crypto and ends with off-ramping out of crypto. If either the on-ramping or the off-ramping processes are closed or guarded, much of crypto's fabled ability to circumvent restrictions is neutered.  What happened in Ottawa  The Ottawa trucker convoy bitcoin fundraiser is a good example of the off-ramping process being leveraged by law enforcement to defang crypto. I described the convoy’s financing last month for CoinDesk. Over the last few weeks various Canadian parliamentary committees and court rulings have shed more light on the fate of the convoy’s finances.  Read more: Dan Kuhn - Humans Are the Last-Mile Problem of Bitcoin Crowdfunding for Canada Truck Protest  By early February, the convoy of truckers blockading downtown Ottawa had transitioned from legal protest to illegal mischief. Sending donations through centralized fiat-based crowdfunding sites became impossible. The convoy’s main fundraising campaign, hosted on GoFundMe, was shut down on Feb. 4. A pivot by convoy organizers to rival crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo was rendered useless by an Ontario court's restraint order a few days later.  That left a bitcoin fundraiser by the name of HonkHonk Hodl as the only way to connect with the rogue blockaders.  The on-ramping stage of the convoy’s bitcoin fundraiser proceeded unimpeded. Any American who wanted to donate to the illegal blockade could freely swap U.S. dollars for bitcoin via an exchange such as Coinbase. Once the cryptocurrency was acquired, no force on earth could stop that bitcoin from being transferred from an American’s personal wallet across the border to the Canadian organizers' bitcoin address.  The bitcoin fundraiser eventually raised $1.1 million in bitcoin. It was at the final stage, off-ramping back into Canadian dollars, that things fell apart.  Governments don't have to fear censorship when they can regulate the on and off-ramps  From the outset, the identities of the people in control of the convoy’s bitcoin wallets had been broadcast across social media. Once the convoy was deemed illegal mischief, these public-facing organizers and their wallet addresses became easy targets of police investigations, freezing orders, injunctions and class-action suits, all of which prevented them from off-ramping out of donated bitcoins into spendable fiat.  The strategy of publicizing the identities of the organizers might seem like a mistake, but it wasn’t. A fundraiser can't gain any momentum if the people collecting the money aren't identified. Anonymous organizers could very well be scammers, and the whiff of fraud would doom fundraising.  Nicholas St. Louis, the lead organizer of the bitcoin fundraiser and a suspect in a criminal investigation, was forced to give up seed phrases for his fundraising wallets to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is Canada’s version of the FBI. Parallel to that, a separate civil court injunction on behalf of an Ottawa class-action suit named hundreds of bitcoin addresses associated with the fundraiser. To comply with the order, St. Louis eventually forfeited $250,000 in undistributed bitcoins to a court-appointed escrow agent. That sum will potentially be used to compensate Ottawa citizens damaged by the convoy's actions.  Just hours before the court injunction fell, St. Louis managed to distribute two-thirds of the donated bitcoins to around 100 truckers. To prove they were honestly distributed, St. Louis recorded himself giving envelopes to each trucker and published the recordings on social media. That made it a cinch for the RCMP, litigators and aggrieved Ottawa citizens to determine the identities of the truckers who received the donations.  Read more: JP Koning - Bitcoin Is a Bad Way to Fund the Ottawa Protest, and That's a Good Thing  The transparency of bitcoin’s blockchain means that all of the distributed bitcoin has been flagged by law enforcement as well as being listed in the court’s freezing order. Anti-money laundering officers at exchanges are on guard, and any effort on the part of the 100 truckers to off-ramp their cryptocurrencies into spendable currency by selling marked bitcoin on an exchange will result in forfeiture. Worse, the truckers could run into potential legal trouble if they try, because ignoring the court’s freezing order is punishable by fine or imprisonment.  Truckers brave enough to risk contravening the court order might try to evade exchange blacklists by directly buying goods and services with bitcoin. (They would have to use retailers that don’t rely on compliant crypto payments processors like BitPay.) Given that bitcoin is so rarely accepted in trade, this is tantamount to barter, and bartering is inconvenient.  So the truckers have been left holding a bunch of mostly useless, even dangerous, injuncted crypto. As for the remaining undistributed donations, they have all been confiscated by the courts. What a mess.  The ransomware option  If bitcoin failed the truckers, let's see why it has worked so well for ransomware operators. Ransomware is malicious software that takes control of a computer by encrypting files or threatening to publicly expose data. The ransomware operator, typically located in Russia, releases that control only after receiving a ransom payment, usually bitcoin. In one of the more notorious incidents, JBS USA, the world’s largest meat supplier, paid an $11 million bitcoin ransom to free its computers.  The ransom payment on-ramping process is completely fluid. That is, it is 100% legal for the U.S. victim of a ransomware attack – usually a corporation such as JBS, a school board or a government agency – to buy bitcoin on an exchange like Coinbase in order to pay the ransom. In fact, a new industry known as ransomware payments facilitation has emerged to service this need.  Whereas a wire payment to a Russian bank account might be frozen or clawed back, a bitcoin payment made to a Russian ransomware operator's wallet can't be. That's tremendously useful to ransomware operators.  Most importantly, Russian officials have made little attempt to inhibit the off-ramping process. As long as ransomware gangs don’t attack Russian companies, their ability to operate on Russian soil has been tolerated as has their access to Russian off-ramps. For instance, nested exchanges with Russian links such as Suex and Chatex have been used by Ryuk and Conti ransomware operators to convert bitcoin ransoms into useful currency.  And that's why ransomware has been so successful. The combination of 1) unimpeded U.S. on-ramping 2) a US-to-Russia bitcoin bridge and 3) unimpeded Russian off-ramping creates an unstoppable monetary circuit. By contrast, Canadians' closure of the off-ramping process crippled the convoy's bitcoin fundraising circuit.  (Incidentally, this is why one of the quickest ways to end the ransomware threat is to shut off the on-ramps: Make it illegal for U.S. entities to pay crypto ransoms. It also illustrates why Russians can’t rely on crypto to evade sanctions: the big off-ramps like Binance and Bitfinex can be controlled by U.S. sanctions policy.)  Governments, whether they be democracies or dictatorships, are often fearful of crypto's censorship-resistance, leading to calls for bans. The lesson from the Ottawa trucker convoy and Russian ransomware gangs is that as long as the on-ramping and off-ramping process are regulated, these fears are overblown.  As for advocates of bitcoin’s capacity to help dissidents, if the trucker convoy proves anything, it’s that these advocates have their work cut out for them.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/22/the-ramps-killing-bitcoins-dissident-thesis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a4ced52321fc01b3335bc9e3c21986f42250317-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411488,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOOFk,1647973409,Web 3 Users Won’t Own Hundreds of Assets,"The average social media user today engages with multiple platforms: TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Discord, YouTube and more. In each of these platforms, users and creators form a marketplace, where one needs the other to thrive. The strength of any Web 2 social network is dependent on the investment of time and energy that people put in: You only get the exponential benefits of having, say, an Instagram account when all your friends (and potential fans) want to be there too.  Kinjal Shah is an early-stage investor at Blockchain Capital, working with founders building the future of crypto.  In the past two decades, the path from user to creator has been carved across every industry. Users document their daily life in Web 2 – everything from morning routines to daily s**tposting is commoditized by social platforms. Users shift to creators as they produce content and grow their audience. TikTok, in particular, has made it so anyone can become famous overnight.  Platforms have benefited from network effects, providing critical distribution over time to users. Social media amassed billions of users and their data profited generously off our attention, time and wallets.  Tokenize everything? Sure. But you become what you own  Web 3 is built on the notion that this way of value capture is broken. Instead of only early investors and teams benefiting from these network effects, in the new era all users who play a role in the success of platforms should benefit. In doing so, users become partial owners of these networks.  Read more: Magdalena Kala - The NBA’s Web 3 Innovation Dilemma  But ownership has serious implications. You are taught to take care of your possessions at a young age. You are told to “take ownership over your actions.” As we get older, the weight of ownership comes with long-term responsibility – your first car, your first home and so on. There are only so many items a person owns where a successful outcome is entirely dependent on their actions. You take care of your house, your car and other high value items with a sense of great responsibility. In theory, this is an exciting proposition.  The reality, though, is a bit more complicated than that.  Defining different types of owners  There are three types of token holders in the market today: long-term investors, short-term speculators and builders. Long-term investors have decided to invest in a project due to the long-term potential and vision. Often, these investors are locked up with their capital and are better aligned with the end user.  Short-term speculators are users who may or may not have conviction but believe in the interim that there is an investment opportunity to be had. These investors trade on sentiment, arbitrage opportunities and siloed market information.  Lastly are the builders. These are the token holders building the projects themselves and investing through their working capital and time. This could be a full-time employee of a protocol, an active community member, an industry advocate and more. Their role creates a unique value proposition. Their commitment and effort spent in a community can directly relate to financial (and social) capital.  Read more: Annie Zhang - Web 3 and the Metaverse Are Not the Same  The downside here, of course, is that ownership comes with responsibility: They need to commit to the project and see it through to the end to gain their rewards.  Users can't own hundreds of assets  With Web 2 users have benefited by being able to put in the effort they choose at a limited cost. Do you want to scroll TikTok passively? Great. Do you want to put out video content weekly? Awesome. The platform rewards you for trying, but it does not inherently ding you for not trying.  In Web 3, it’s the opposite. With every new user who doesn’t actively participate, there is potential to detract from the value of the network and, therefore, your direct financial incentive. If you don’t stake your tokens, you lose potential annual percentage yield. You miss rewards if you don’t create an NFT on the network. The more users you onboard – the better you will do.  This is a feature, not a bug.  As a result, users are much more likely only to invest their assets where they are willing to contribute to the overall network or in a network that has achieved a scale whereby each additional token holder requires less effort. In many ways, this means that early users subsidize future users’ costs while they bootstrap the network and take on early growth risk.  Rather than holding hundreds of assets, genuine users will reach a new version of “Dunbar’s number” (the idea that there is a limit to sustainable group size) where each incremental asset they own results in a depreciating impact on their finances.  Ultimately, the thesis that users will want to own hundreds of assets just doesn’t pan out. There isn’t enough time to commit to everything.  Tokenize everything? Sure.

Guillaume Valette-Valla, director of Tracfin, the country’s anti-money laundering body, told lawmakers at the European Parliament that even those making small online payments should be forced to reveal their identity. Such small anonymous transactions shouldn’t be allowed, he added.  The warning comes as the European Central Bank’s Christine Lagarde warned of cryptocurrencies' role in evading the financial sanctions placed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.  “We have observed several times the use of crypto assets from Europe” being used to fund “terrorism, and complicity with terrorism, in the Syria-Iraq region,” Valette-Valla told a joint session of the European Parliament's economic and civil liberties committees Tuesday.  Similar cases relating to child pornography were “sadly recurrent,” he added, saying that last week he had transferred three cases to the public prosecutor in which small transactions had been made to view live cases of child abuse in Southeast Asia.  Valette-Valla’s organization, Tracfin, is part of the French economics ministry and is responsible for gathering intelligence on suspected illicit finance from financial companies and other sources, passing its findings to judicial authorities for potential prosecution.  “Your assembly could give a big plus to our operational activity” by ensuring “deanonymization from the first euro” of a crypto payment, he said, saying that individual transfers linked to criminal activity were sometimes under 10 euros (US$11).  The lawmakers are currently considering plans to extend existing payment transparency rules to the crypto sector in a way that could end online anonymity altogether.  Under these rules, known colloquially as the travel rule, conventional bank transfers need to identify parties involved in any transaction over 1,000 euros, with suspicious transactions passed on to the authorities. But lawmakers are leaning towards abolishing that lower threshold for crypto transactions because large digital payments can easily be broken up into smaller chunks that evade detection, a practice known as smurfing.  Read more: European Parliament Proposes Expanding 'Travel Rule' to Every Single Crypto Transaction  Assita Kanko, the Belgian lawmaker responsible for marshaling the European Parliament’s views on the new proposals, seems undeterred by the backlash to those plans from the crypto industry, and might even extend the proposals further into crypto holdings that are held privately rather than via intermediaries.  “I'm convinced that proper regulation of crypto transfers will help, not harm, the growth and innovation in this sector. It will increase trust and help our authorities to push back against abuse,” Kanko said at the hearing. “We are discussing proposals to include transfers involving unhosted wallets while working on guarantees for personal data protection.”  Kanko appeared to gain support from global money laundering standard setters the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  “The scale of use of unhosted wallets is not to that extent that we are worried currently, but I think we closely have to observe it,” FATF President Marcus Pleyer told lawmakers. “There might come the moment when we have to indeed take them into the scope of the regulation.”  Editor's note: Comments by Valette-Valla in this article have been translated from French.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/22/crypto-implicated-in-child-porn-terrorism-french-official-says-calling-for-end-to-online-anynomity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a2e7e19a67b9da5d3569af927f0140ea2ac19ed-5326x3543.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395742,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASz9TO,1647971979,Bitcoin Price Breaks Out to Highest in Almost 3 Weeks,"Bitcoin rose to a three-week high as cryptocurrencies moved with major stock market indices.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose to $42,673 as of press time, up 4.1% in the past 24 hours.  The price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value touched $43,337 earlier Tuesday, the highest point since March 3.  “Bitcoin's price is, broadly, moving in line with the major indices,” said Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics. “Crypto Twitter has been forecasting an upwards movement based on a combination of technical analysis and certain fundamentals, but it's too early to say whether this is a sustained rally.”  Bitcoin trading volume is around 30,000 BTC in the past 24 hours, a low point compared to the past month.  “As $BTC soars to $42,000, more than 15,000 BTC in outflows from exchanges were spotted yesterday,” IntoTheBlock Insights wrote in a comment, “the largest since Jan 29.”  Bitcoin outflows from exchanges are often seen by crypto analysts as a sign that traders aren’t looking for a quick sale – so they might be moving the coins into long-term custody or storage options. An elevated rate outflows is typically seen as bullish.  “The last time BTC experienced a large outflow,” IntoThe Block wrote, “it was followed by a significant rise in price.”  The bitcoin market took a hit briefly on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled in a speech that the U.S. central bank might raise the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point at certain meetings over the rest of the year. He said that officials are ready to “slow the market” to bring down the inflation.  However, the market bounced back aggressively Tuesday despite the Fed’s hawkish attitude. Equity markets also went up. Nasdaq was up 1.7% and the S&P 500 was up 1%.  Before announcing a more aggressive Fed action, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a 0.25 percentage point rate hike last Wednesday.

42411473,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONc4,1647971256,"Vitalik Buterin's Dad on Ukraine, Censorship and Decentralization","Russian-Canadian computer programmer and entrepreneur Dmitry Buterin may have introduced his son Vitalik to Bitcoin – the first step in a chain of events that led to the development of the most-used blockchain today, Ethereum, that Vitalik co-founded – but he doesn’t put much store in his place in crypto history.  Dmitry, who often goes by the Russian diminutive, Dima, is a modest and thoughtful man. Now semiretired after a successful career in software engineering, Dima spends his free time reading philosophy and going for walks. He takes pictures of the simple pleasures of nature – frost on a tree limb, the first flowers of spring. And he gets more fulfillment advising early-stage crypto projects, and running the educational company BlockGeeks, than playing Vitalik’s Dad for the media.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Buterin, like many other true believers in crypto, relishes in complexity. The so-called “world computer,” Ethereum, is at the center of a techno-economic revolution affecting everything from banking to the backbone of the web. But as big as this project is, it will work best if built of smaller, discrete parts.  “Right now, the most creative decentralized projects are designed by techies,” Dima said in a recent interview with The Node. Ethereum’s success, he thinks, is largely due to its design, which makes it easy for anyone to build or use its crypto-powered applications. Likewise, some of the world’s most deranged problems stem from the centralization of power and influence.  Born in the Soviet Union, and later a citizen of Russia and Canada, Dima has been an outspoken critic of authoritarians the world over – including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Long before Putin invaded Ukraine, causing the death of thousands and the displacement of millions, Dima was willing to call the president an “autocrat.” “Corruption has seized the highest levels of the state,” he said recently.  Crypto has emerged, perhaps surprisingly, as a useful lifeline for those impacted directly by the war. Coming up on a month since Russia’s invasion, the Ukrainian government has raised over $100 million in various cryptocurrencies for military and civilian needs. Millions more are being routed to charitable efforts, through vehicles like Ukraine DAO (short for decentralized autonomous organization) or direct, on-chain donations.  But crypto may take on an even larger role during and after this crisis. By privileging free-market organization and the decentralization of authority, these novel protocols support new systems that might ensure no one like Putin can gain power again, Dima said. “It feels to me that this whole situation will lead the next big push towards adoption of crypto,” he said. This emphasis on decentralization is why Dima thinks crypto platforms should not join in blanket sanctions of all Russian people.  Decentralization – and the profit-motive – are double-edged swords, however. Last week, Time magazine published the latest in-depth profile of Vitalik, where the Ethereum creator urged the industry to think more critically about the things being built or how the system is used. The most profitable programs – like needless NFTs or dead end DAOs – aren’t always the ones the world needs most, he said. It’s a position Dima agrees with, who said technologists need to focus on “human” problems.  See also: A Possible Russian Crypto Ban and Vitalik's Synthetic Womb | Podcast  Below is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation covering the Ukrainian war, Jeff Bezos’ yacht and the importance of building tech that empowers people.  Crypto seems to be reckoning its place in global finance. Do you think centralized crypto exchanges or service providers have a moral obligation or political duty to sanction Russian users?  Here's how I think about this: The war in Ukraine is horrible – people are in pain, they are without food and water and hiding in bomb shelters for longer than two week. Right now the top priority for the world is to stop this depravity. People may purge native [Russians], inflict as much pain on Putin and his supporters, hoping this will make them stop. It makes total sense emotionally, right? But in any difficult situation, there will be a lot of knee-jerk reactions.  I want to do everything I can in my power to stop this war. But it doesn't make a lot of sense. The average crypto user who's using some kind of centralized exchange, they’re not likely to be one of Putin’s oligarchs or to benefit from this conflict.  There are many educated people who actively oppose Putin – they’re basically hostages in their own country. Whether they protest or stay silent, cutting them off from access … I think the cure is becoming worse than the disease. But I also totally understand why people call for those kinds of matters.  Similarly for DeFi platforms – these supposedly open financial platforms that in theory can’t levy sanctions. Is this a proving ground for that position?  Very much. Who knows – the skeptics may be right. But it feels to me that this whole situation will lead the next big push towards adoption of crypto. We already see how useful and important it’s been in supporting Ukraine. I have personally donated a chunk of money to a bunch of initiatives. The latest reports show they’ve brought in over $100 million just through crypto – directly, quickly. The layers of bureaucracy have been instantly eliminated and made unnecessary. So that's awesome.  With sanctions, life is quickly becoming very hard in Russia for many people whether they support Putin or not. We have to be careful in how we deal with that. I'm sure we will see attempts in Russia, by the government or industries, to go around sanctions using crypto. It's inevitable. For me, the question is how do we support these people while destroying this crazy autocratic regime. Crypto is a great instrument to do that.  See also: Ukraine Fundraisers Bring Out the Best, and Worst, in Crypto | The Node  Corruption has seized the highest levels of the state, and is even seen in places abroad where Russian oligarchs have bought foreign politicians. So even if [crypto] is used by governments, institutions and oligarchs, it's a wonderful way to introduce transparency. Trying to stop little transactions is futile and likely not directed towards the right people. But it reasonably becomes much easier for us to understand huge flows of money if Russian [institutions] use crypto to evade sanctions. And we can figure out a way to deal with that.  The deputy minister of digital transformation in Ukraine said crypto is more “convenient” than traditional crowdsourcing means. Are you thinking about alternative ways to deploy crypto beyond simple, on-chain crowdsourcing?  I think it's already happening. There's Ukraine DAO – I have, and I believe Vitalik has donated money. We will see more and more of that. But DAOs are still quite inefficient. The way they are structured is very organic. Right now we're in emergency mode, and when you're in emergency mode, creating a DAO, figuring out its mission, delegating decision making and stuff like that takes time. So in the short term it’s easier to pursue less complicated methods.  But I'm pretty sure we’ll see impactful [experiments]. For example, I've seen a database that people are using to document the war crimes that Russia has committed in Ukraine. Volunteers are submitting pictures. Implementing a DAO structure on that might become feasible longer-term, so that contributors can maybe get paid. Maybe there could be some kind of reputation system that helps verification or streamline fact-checking.  Are you 100% focused on crypto, and where do you think the biggest opportunity is for entrepreneurs in crypto right now?  I am, if you will, semi-retired. I'm still involved in a bunch of things and doing some angel investments and mentoring and coaching and have this company I co-founded. Like 95% of what I'm involved in is improving crypto because it is the most interesting, most exciting space. It's a new wave of technology.  In terms of opportunity, I think Web 3 is entering the era of mass adoption. We found all those weaknesses and problems with centralized platforms and are now building solutions. It’ll be important to maintain focus on what is really foundationally important, the decentralized aspects of those systems.  When I look at something like Solana – it’s a wonderful short-term solution. It’s efficient, cheaper, blah, blah, blah, but I am not impressed with the way they are for decentralization, so it's of no interest to me. But it gets to the other opportunity in crypto: good user experience.  Right now, the most creative decentralized projects, you know, are designed by techies. We need to start thinking about that. Even if you look at crypto wallets, most are very generic. You can hold your crypto, your NFTs. But as an NFT collector, I would actually love to have a dedicated, features-specific wallet. Or maybe I'm more of an investor, so it's more about day-to-day transactions. So figuring out the user journey – what people want to do – without pushing technology in their face is where the potential is. Designing systems that are user friendly, and also address huge societal issues – like censorship and spam.  Considering that crypto is always embedded in legal and cultural systems that can make it infeasible to use crypto – even if you can still transact on-chain – is it a fool's errand to try to attempt to bring “digital money” into real life?  No, I don't think it's a fool's errand at all. I think it's a very viable effort. For smart people in technology, it's very common to end up being over focused on technology – how sophisticated, how wonderful, how complicated this is! – and not think through those “last mile” problems. The human aspects – censorship resistance and whatnot – can change the features of Bitcoin. There are solutions for the biggest problems being developed.  What we see in those protests in Canada or the situation in Ukraine: It's really a moment of showing the weaknesses of our current centralized systems. We learned to trust these big centralized systems like: “Hey, Facebook, store my data, hey, bank, store my money, hey, Twitter, store my past.” Now we see that they're misusing their power. They're censoring us, selling our data to advertisers, printing money and all that.  See also: Bitcoin's Censorship-Resistance Was a Step Change in History  This process that started with Bitcoin, with keeping our own money, is not easy. People learn quickly that if they lose their phone and don't backup their seed phrase, nobody is there to help. This is a really hard wake-up call. So we have to be careful, but there is no doubt there is a transition happening before our eyes that is solving real, human problems.  It's really a wonderful time for all of us to people who are already involved in the decentralized movements to help other people learn more about self-sovereignty, new organizations – all that. This Web 3 crypto bubble is finally enveloping the whole world.  I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about Vitalik. Do you remember his first word?  No idea. You know, he actually started verbalizing later. He was actually much better with writing – he mastered verbalization later in his childhood. Actually, when he was, I think, four, we gave him our old IBM PC, and he was using Excel. He quickly learned to type numbers into cells and play with formulas.

Breaking it down  Last week, Warren introduced the “Digital Asset Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act of 2022,” a bill that would authorize the U.S. government to identify and sanction crypto companies that are not based in the U.S. but which facilitate transactions on behalf of individuals on the U.S. sanctions list.  Warren introduced the bill during a Senate Banking Committee hearing titled “Understanding the Role of Digital Assets in Illicit Finance,” which by and large seemed fairly substantive.  A lot has been written about this bill in the four days since its introduction. Rather than retread questions about the bill’s constitutionality, whether it has sufficient support to pass or whether it solves an existing issue, I want to focus on another aspect.  I’ll let Michael Mosier, currently at Espresso Systems and formerly of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and Chainalysis, explain:  “Fifteen months after the passage of landmark [anti-money laundering] modernization legislation, none of the tens of millions of dollars needed to implement it has been appropriated.”  Mosier was one of the four witnesses in last week’s panel. In his pre-written testimony, which he read as his opening statement, he recommended Congress pass a proper budget, the one “that was due last October.”  He went on to explain that FinCEN and the Office of Foreign Assets Control – the Treasury Department wing that oversees sanctions – have not received $74 million ($64 million for FinCEN, $10 million for OFAC) they should have after the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 was passed as part of the broader National Defense Authorization Act.  Congress has passed continuing resolutions rather than a proper budget for 2021. Under these CRs, funding levels basically remain frozen at their 2020 levels. The new funds the agencies should have received would go to boosting their personnel and technology support, Mosier said in his testimony.  “Empower FinCEN to use the data already coming to them before burdening them – and industry – with additional data collection for which they will be asked what good use they made of it,” Mosier said. “They are being set up for failure by unfunded mandates.”  Which brings us back to Warren’s bill. I emailed two press aides asking if Warren would include a funding provision (among other things).  The bill itself would:  Have the U.S. President (guessing this means Treasury) write a report identifying non-U.S.-based crypto exchanges that engage with sanctioned Russian individuals  Have the President (Treasury?) sanction these individuals and exchanges  Allow the U.S. Treasury Secretary to block U.S. crypto exchanges or exchanges operating in the U.S. from operating in Russia or facilitating transactions for Russia-based individuals  Have FinCEN file currency transaction reports for individuals who transact more than $10,000 in crypto through at least one offshore account  Have the Treasury Secretary identify any resources that Treasury needs 120 days after the bill is signed into law  Have the Treasury Secretary identify any exchanges that are “high risk” for sanctions evasion and other crimes  Point 4 above strongly resembles a provision in the unhosted wallet rule the industry was intensely focused on at the end of 2020 (albeit the less-unpopular provision – on the face of it this would bring crypto reporting in line with existing rules for cash).  The rest of it seems more focused on this theoretical issue that crypto is being used to evade sanctions.  In my email to Warren’s press folks, I asked:  If there was any data or evidence that suggests crypto is being used to evade sanctions  How the FinCEN proposal (reporting individuals who transact with more than $10,000 per day) ties into the Russia-specific provisions  What authorities the bill provides for that FinCEN/OFAC don't already have  Whether Sen. Warren will include a funding provision for these new tasks  I did not receive a response to my email.  Now, to be clear, Warren’s concerns are not unwarranted. Her stated concern, which she has reiterated time and again, is that Russian oligarchs or the Russian government might turn to crypto as a tool to evade sanctions resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Which is certainly possible.  It seems incredibly unlikely at this point the Russian government will use crypto as a sanctions evasion tool for a variety of reasons, which I’ve discussed in past editions of this newsletter.  Individuals, on the other hand, may be better able to take advantage of crypto. Even here, however, it seems unlikely there will be any crypto-for-sanctions-evasion at scale. Several Treasury officials, on the record, have said they’re not concerned about this issue.  Nellie Liang, the undersecretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, told Reuters the U.S. government has seen an increase in digital asset usage for illicit finance, but it’s a “fairly small” amount of transactions.  ""Of course, we recognize we may not see everything, but there is a fair amount of oversight. At this point, we just don't see that it could be used in a large-scale way to evade sanctions,” she told the news service.  During the hearing, Warren asked Jonathan Levin of Chainalysis whether oligarchs could break their fortunes into chunks of $100 million, convert that into crypto and use that to evade sanctions.  Chainalysis has software that can track these funds, even if mixers or chain hopping tools are used, Levin said.  Shane Stansbury, a former cyber crimes prosecutor and current fellow at Duke University, would only go so far as to say crypto for sanctions evasion is “theoretically possible.”  “Obviously, it’s hard but at least if [an oligarch] is able to go to a friendly jurisdiction and use cryptocurrency exchanges or some other platform that’s not in compliance with internationally recognized anti-money laundering standards as you’ve suggested, that is possible,” he said.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision nominee Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her name from consideration last week. Almost immediately after, the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the nominations of Fed Chair Pro Tempore and Chair nominee Jerome Powell, Fed Vice Chair nominee Lael Brainard (currently a Fed governor) and Fed board nominees Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook.

42394533,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBWcr,1647967739,"No Stupid Questions: What’s a Crypto Token, Anyway?","The concept of transferring non-physical currency can be confusing to many. What exactly is being transferred – if anything – and what does a cryptocurrency actually look like? These are all valid questions, and ones that can be easily explained.  Crypto tokens commonly serve as units of cryptocurrency. They are designed to do the same job as physical tokens or coins like American cents, British pounds, etc. They are simple units of value that can be passed from one person to another.  At a technical level, a crypto token is a simple piece of code that is attached to a single user’s public wallet address. A crypto ‘wallet’ refers to a special type of computer software that is specifically designed to interact with blockchains and is where each user’s tokens are kept.  Unlike physically exchanging real cash from one person to another, transferring cryptocurrency doesn’t involve a transfer of value at all. It’s simply a case of updating the ownership of specific tokens to the new holder’s address. In this way, it’s not the tokens that are transferred between users in the network, but the addresses attached to each token are exchanged.  Read more: What Is Cryptography?  All data related to balances and accounts are stored on a blockchain, which is a continuous, digital record of which tokens are held by which users at any given time. All crypto tokens are identified by unique strings of code, although all the tokens of a certain type are usually treated as identical and interchangeable – much like individual U.S. dollar notes will have a serial number but can be mutually exchanged for another of the same face value.  The innovative feature of crypto tokens is they don’t need a privately managed bank ledger to keep track of how much you have in your account. Instead, that information is immutably logged on a transparent blockchain ledger and verified by all users in the network to ensure only valid transactions and balances are committed to it. This is why cryptocurrencies are referred to as ""decentralized"" payment systems.  Read more: How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work?  Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a special type of crypto token that differs in a number of ways from all other traded crypto-assets in the market. The main difference is NFTs cannot be mutually exchanged as U.S. dollar bills or bitcoin (BTC) can. That’s because each NFT points to a completely unique item (whether it be tangible or intangible) and so it has its own perceived value. An easy way to think of NFTs is trying to imagine trading the Mona Lisa for a rare Pokemon card. The two items are completely different, with their own unique traits and features, meaning you couldn’t simply swap them like-for-like.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/no-stupid-questions-whats-a-crypto-token-anyway,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b1a33e37e9c83088e1265637e67e98fb07ee7894-2019x1484.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BlockFi CEO Zac Prince, venture firm Blockchain Capital (via founders Bart and Brad Stephens) and crypto investor Brian Kelly, a frequent CNBC contributor, donated $400,000 to GMI PAC in February. Kelly himself donated $250,000.  They’re the latest bigwigs to back what is fast becoming a hub for the crypto industry’s political donations. Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge hedge fund, trading firm FTX, venture fund Multicoin and data hub Messari have also backed GMI (a nod to the crypto slang “gonna make it”), which was formally organized in September.  Disclosed in a Friday regulatory filing, the latest contributions shed some light into crypto’s battle for Capitol Hill.  Super PACs can plow millions into ad campaigns to boost candidates. They offer the wealthy a gilded pathway to political influence that federal campaign contribution limits would otherwise restrict.  Crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, for example, gave $2 million to GMI PAC in mid-January, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) data. That’s orders of magnitude more than he could have contributed directly. The FTX founder was one of President Joe Biden’s single largest backers (via PACs) during the last election cycle.

Lagarde said the amount of Russian rubles going into crypto and stablecoins have been on the rise, speaking at the Bank for International Settlements’ Innovation Summit on Tuesday.  Trading volumes between the Russian ruble and bitcoin soared to a nine-month high even as the country's fiat currency plunged to record lows against the dollar due to its invasion of Ukraine in late February. Regulators in Europe and the U.S. implemented heavy sanctions on Russia in an attempt to isolate its economy.  “We have taken steps to clearly signal to all those who are exchanging transacting offering services in relation to crypto assets,” Lagarde said, adding that they are “accomplices” to those trying to circumvent sanctions.  While lawmakers have expressed concerns that crypto might be used to evade sanctions, there has been little evidence to support this. Multiple U.S. officials have stated they do not see sanctions evasion via crypto as a realistic possibility.  But Lagarde’s comments on Tuesday seemed to suggest crypto assets are generally associated with financial crime.  ""So is it a threat? Yes. Has it … been a threat in the past? Yes, because when you look at a lot of the dubious transactions that are taking place, a lot of the criminal activities payments that are taking place, very often you find some crypto assets,” Lagarde said.  In February, Lagarde said that it’s “critically important” to quickly finalize and enforce the European Union’s proposed regulatory package for crypto assets, particularly over concerns that sanctioned entities in Russia will turn to crypto to evade sanctions. The proposed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework is currently moving through the EU’s complex legislative process.  Progress on a digital euro  Lagarde also talked about the ECB’s much-anticipated plans for a digital euro at a moderator’s urging during Tuesday’s session. Although regulators in the U.S. and beyond have previously indicated central bank digital currencies (CBDC) should not be rushed, Lagarde said that sentiment might have changed due to a number of reasons, including pressure from customers.  She recently said she would support speeding up work on a potential digital euro.  “Yes, there is urgency, and we need to do real solid work to respond to the needs that are out there,"" Lagarde said on Tuesday.  The digital euro needs to be “operational, faster, easier, cheaper, more secure across the whole of Europe,” Lagarde said, adding that a digital currency should improve inclusion and support financial stability. However, the goal of a digital currency is not a monetary policy instrument or a means to eliminate cash, she noted.  Lagarde added that the ECB wants to prevent other players from taking sole advantage of the digital world and that the ECB is on track to complete its digital euro project in two years.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Camomile Shumba, Sandali Handagama",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/22/crypto-remains-a-threat-ecb-chief-christine-lagarde,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af54728f5fc58eeaf59ed3919327b9a4f5a670ad-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410899,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3ao,1647964566,Bitmain Redux: Bitdeer and BitFuFu Are About to Test US Stock Market's Mining Appetite,"BitFuFu and Bitdeer will be the first cloud mining platforms to list on U.S. stock exchanges this year, and if their current valuations are anything to go by, investors are willing to pay up for their “phenomenal” growth prospects, even as the crypto market has pulled away from its peaks.  The miners have a similar origin story: Both were born out of the world’s largest crypto mining rig manufacturer, China-based Bitmain, and both are going public in the U.S. via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), with somewhat similar business models. On top of that, both have very credible management teams. One even has the “Elon Musk of crypto” as the company’s founder and chairman.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week series  Moreover, the two companies promise exceptional growth rates, both in profitability and in operations, for the shareholders who are willing to pay a premium for a piece of these soon-to-be public miners. Bitdeer expects to increase its revenue 54% in 2022 from the previous year and boost its total hashrate by 133%. Meanwhile, BitFuFu forecasts growing both its revenue and hashrate by about 230% each in 2022 from 2021.  But the way these two companies came into existence was anything but smooth, and their valuations, higher relative to some of their publicly traded peers, have drawn the attention of some analysts.  Read More: What Is Cloud Mining?  The origin story of two bitcoin miners  Throughout 2020, Bitmain’s two co-founders, Ketuan “Micree” Zhan and Jihan Wu, were fighting for control of one of the world’s largest crypto firms. The struggle, which once resulted in physical violence, ended with an amicable separation in January 2021: Zhan kept Bitmain’s design and manufacturing business, buying Wu's share, whereas Wu kept Bitdeer.  Fast forward to April of that year, and Zhan’s Bitmain invested an undisclosed amount in BitFuFu, a mining platform founded in December 2020.

Ahead of BitFuFu’s third quarter Nasdaq listing, the miner boasts a close partnership with Bitmain which includes benefits in sourcing equipment and close cooperation in the operation and maintenance of machines. The two have signed a 10-year hosting agreement and are planning to build 300 megawatts of mining capacity.  BitFuFu claims that it is the only cloud-mining strategic partner of Bitmain, as of January of this year, and it had $70 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing led by Bitmain and mining pool Antpool, according to a presentation.  Meanwhile, Bitdeer plans to list on the Nasdaq at the end of the first quarter. Both firms boast a diversified business model; they mine bitcoin of their own, provide cloud hashrate to customers, and host third-party miners, according to their respective presentations. BitFuFu also sells outdated mining rigs in the second-hand market, it said in its presentation.  “Bitdeer and BitFuFu are good crypto-mining proxies with unique value propositions, giving investors exposure to the outlook for a more globalized mining industry,” Esme Pau, head of emerging technologies at brokerage China Tonghai Securities, told CoinDesk.  A bitcoin mining tech comparison  Today, BitFuFu counts 3 exahash/second (EH/S) in hashrate, a measure of computing power on the Bitcoin network, compared with Bitdeer’s 8.6 EH/s. Together, they account for about 5.6% of the total network’s hashrate. Bitcoin’s global hashrate was about 207 EH/s as of March 21, according to data analytics firm Glassnode.  BitFuFu plans to increase its managed hashrate to 10 EH/s by the end of 2022, with 4.5 EH/s coming from self-owned operations and 5.5 EH/s from third parties, according to a press release. This represents a 230% hashrate increase in 2022 compared to 2021.  In the same time period, Bitdeer is looking at 20 EH/s, 13.1 EH/s of which will be proprietary, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That’s a 133% gain in total hashrate in 2022 from 8.6 EH/s in 2021. Bitdeer’s facilities are spread across five sites located in the U.S. and Norway. Half of the energy it uses comes from carbon-neutral sources, according to the filing.  BitFuFu, whose corporate name is Finfront Holding Company, has facilities in the U.S. and Canada. It set up operations in Kazakhstan in 2021, which it later abandoned following energy shortages, moving the hashrate to the U.S.  Read more: Bitmain-Backed BitFuFu Abandons Mining Rigs In Kazakhstan Due to Power Rationing  Cloud mining demand vs. regulation  Cloud mining has proven a popular model with retail and institutional investors, so much so that Bitdeer said that its hosting plans were sold out for several weeks starting Jan. 31. “We may not have any hosting plans any time soon,” and “plans are just on high demand,” said a customer service representative on Bitdeer’s official English channel on Jan. 31. Bitdeer added new plans recently, and on average, 39% of the available options have been sold as of March 22.  Cloud mining allows investors to participate in the bitcoin network without owning and operating the equipment themselves. Firms run their own data centers or partner with other miners, leasing the equipment through an online platform, giving the users a choice as to what machines they won’t lease and what mining pools they want to mine with.  One of the ways the platforms can make money, is from the difference between the higher retail prices that they charge their clients and the lower bulk prices at which they buy electricity and equipment.  One caveat with overseas companies that offer cloud mining services and hashrate tokens is that they need to be careful when coming to the West, where securities laws are more well defined and regulators have a track record of firm actions, said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer and co-founder of Luxor Technology.  “As we saw with the recent BlockFi settlement, the regulators are becoming quite aware of the ecosystem,” Vera said. “These types of mining contracts may pass as securities, and if they are will need to be properly regulated, or else will pose significant regulatory risk for their investors,” he added.  However, given the nature of the business of cloud mining, it's possible the miners could be spared some regulatory scrutiny. “As hash rate hosting marketplaces with a distributed portfolio of mining data centers, they can democratize access via cloud mining and, to a certain extent, be less directly subject to regulatory risks of specific jurisdictions,” China Tonghai Securities’ Pau said.  The financials  Regulatory risks aside, with high demand for cloud mining and the two companies’ abilities to continue to fuel growth, it's no surprise that stock market investors are willing to pay a premium for miners coming into an already saturated industry, even when the crypto market has pulled away from its November 2021 peaks.  Both firms will be going public through SPACs. Also known as blank check companies, these firms have no commercial operations and are formed solely for going public. SPACs usually go public via initial public offerings (IPOs) first and then acquire other firms, effectively bringing them to public markets. The deal often involves some people from the acquired company taking seats on the SPAC’s board of directors.  Bitdeer will merge with Blue Safari Corporation (BSGA) at an implied market cap of $4.08 billion, according to a company presentation. The new company will be renamed to Bitdeer and Wu will continue to serve as chairman of Bitdeer’s board, according to SEC filings.  Meanwhile, BitFuFu is going public via Arisz Acquisition Corp. (ARIZ) and the equity was valued at about $1.66 billion, according to a company presentation.  A quick look at how both of the miners’ expected growth in hashrate for 2022 is valued compared to some of the top publicly traded miners reveals that both Bitdeer and BitFuFu are valued slightly higher.  Based on just the self-mining hashrate, the market capitalization to 2022 expected hashrate multiple is around 0.3x for both Bitdeer and BitFuFu, while the top three publicly traded miners range from 0.12x to 0.18x.  Paying a premium  Both Bitdeer and BitFuFu could be seen as “fully valued” compared to current publicly listed miners because of their “incredible” growth rate, superior profit margins and tight relationships with mining rig suppliers, Peter Stoneberg, managing director of crypto mergers and acquisitions at Architect Partners, told CoinDesk in an interview. It’s the future prospects of companies that drive investment, so if investors see a company is able to fund its future growth, they will “absolutely pay a premium for that growth rate,” Stoneberg added.  In fact, Bitdeer recorded $380 million in revenue in 2021 and forecasts a rise of 54% to $586 million in 2022. Meanwhile, BitFuFu expects its revenue for the full year to more than double in 2022 to $330 million.  The two companies’ shared roots also add to their appeal: Investors will be willing to pay up for companies that originate from a pioneer in the mining sector, Bitmain. The rig manufacturer “is still the centerpiece of the mining industry, and any company related to it, such as BitFuFu and Bitdeer, is strategically positioned to capitalize on favorable procurement opportunities and networks,” said Luxor’s Vera.  Betting on cloud mining leadership  Another reason investors are usually willing to pay a premium is if they have faith in the management to build a profitable company. With someone as successful as Jihan Wu, investors are betting on him, Stoneberg said. “Having co-founded Bitmain and starting Matrixport and Bitdeer, it's a bet on a highly successful and exceptionally well connected entrepreneur,” Stoneberg said.  Stoneberg likened Wu to Tesla’s Elon Musk. Investors are betting on Musk, a successful entrepreneur, when they are investing in Tesla. Wu is a similar case, with investors betting on his stellar track record. “Like Wu, Musk has started three companies that have become unicorns, so he's a little bit like the Elon Musk of crypto,” Stoneberg added.  Wu and his team will keep a big chunk of the listed firm. After the Bitdeer and Blue Safari merger closes, about 72% of the surviving company’s shares will be held by the founding members of Bitdeer. Around 24% will go to investors, including legendary tech venture capital firm Sequoia, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek, IDG Capital and China-focused private equity fund New Horizon, according to the company presentation.  After BitFuFu completes its SPAC merger, 90% of the company will be held by BitFuFu’s shareholders, 4.4% by SPAC public shareholders and 4.2% by PIPE investors. One of the largest mining pools, AntPool, is part of the PIPE financing.  The SPAC conundrum  Both miners are going public at a time when crypto and broader markets have pulled back from their peaks while investors have shunned most of the risky assets amid potential interest rate hikes and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. One miner, Rhodium Enterprises, had to postpone its IPO that was valued at almost $2 billion, due to pullback in the overall market.  Additionally, the downside of going public via SPAC is that historically when a SPAC deal is announced the shares of the public entity surge, then when the deal is completed, they drift lower, according to research by Nasdaq.  “After a merger is announced, stronger valuation differences are priced in, and the distribution of performance widens, with around 25% of SPACs gaining more than 100%, while about 50% of SPACs drift down to record losses versus their common share first trade price, mostly after they complete their business combinations,” the report said.  In fact, Core Scientific, the largest North American public miner by hashrate, also recently went public through a SPAC deal and started trading on Jan. 20. The stock saw extreme volatility in the first month of trading where it swung from more than a 30% decline to 30% gains from its first day’s closing price. The share prices are currently slightly higher than the Jan. 20 closing price.  Such a scenario could play out for both Bitdeer and BitFuFu, at least in the short term, after the miners “de-SPAC” or complete their merges. However, regardless of the short-term volatility and a premium valuation, longer-term investors should keep their eye on the prize, which is their “phenomenal growth rate,” said Stoneberg.

The Republic of Ireland's central bank issued this alert as part of a general warning about the risks of investing in crypto assets.  In an announcement Tuesday, the Central Bank of Ireland ""emphasized that crypto assets are highly risky and speculative, and may not be suitable for retail customers.  ""In particular, people need to be alert to the risks of misleading advertisements, particularly on social media, where influencers are being paid to advertise crypto assets.""  The central bank's warning comes as part of a Europe-wide campaign by financial regulators surrounding the risks in crypto investment. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) last week issued a statement saying consumers ""face the very real possibility of losing all their invested money if they buy these assets.""  Warnings of this nature by central banks and regulators are nothing new. It is possible that European authorities are responding to the ever increasing interest in crypto, which has been given a boost in recent weeks by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the connotations for crypto assets that have followed.

42390175,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bX2l5F,1647958715,Why Some Bitcoin Devs Say Lasers Can Cut Mining’s Energy Costs,"Bitcoin’s energy use has long been a hot-button issue. Now some developers say the solution could lie in a more energy-efficient form of computer processing that, perhaps appropriately, uses lasers.  When we consider Bitcoin’s energy use, really, the discussion should focus on emissions. Industry participants have worked toward improving transparency in that category the past couple of years. If we look even further back, Hal Finney – who received the first bitcoin transaction ever from the system’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto – said he was “thinking about how to reduce CO2 emissions from a widespread Bitcoin implementation” in 2009.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Mining Week series.  Most arguments about remediating Bitcoin’s emissions problem center around:  Outright banning it.  Cleaning up its energy mix.  Switching from proof-of-work (PoW) to a consensus mechanism that doesn’t require heavy use of electricity to work, typically proof-of-stake (PoS) – a transition Ethereum has been planning to carry out since 2015.  Rarely discussed is the possibility of changing to a different type of PoW.  Bitcoin Optech, a working group of developers that produces free educational materials, pointed out in its Jan. 5, 2022, newsletter that Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 52 was officially brought into the discussion for a proposed hard fork, or major change to Bitcoin. BIP 52 aspires to shift expenses from electricity costs or operating expenses to hardware costs or capital expenditures. This shift would be achieved through what is known as “optical proof-of-work,” or oPoW, a proposal created by Michael Dubrovsky, Bogdan Penkovsky - both contributors to the non-profit PoWx - and an assistant professor at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Marshall Ball (among others).  Read More: CoinDesk Research: Does Bitcoin Have an Energy Problem?  What is optical proof-of-work?  In short, oPoW would change the proof-of-work algorithm used by Bitcoin now to one dubbed “HeavyHash” that is most efficiently computed using a new class of photonic processors. The motivation behind oPoW is to “decouple Bitcoin mining from energy and make it feasible outside of regions with low electricity costs.” This shift, proponents argue, would improve geographic distribution of computing power, or hashrate; decrease barriers to entry for new miners; and quell any fears of climate-related pushback as Bitcoin proliferates and grows in popularity, since the switch would reduce Bitcoin’s energy demand.  It is worth mentioning before we go further that optical proof-of-work is still not fully developed and has not been used in practice in a Bitcoin testnet, or an experimental environment for software changes. There is a live implementation of oPoW called oBTC, which is based on an oPoW-modified Bitcoin codebase published by PoWx in March 2021. It is not actively marketed or managed by oPoW’s creators, but there is a community of supporters who mine and trade oBTC. Additionally, PoWx is collaborating with optical computing companies, including Lightelligence, to explore commercialization of an oPoW miner and is testing HeavyHash on a demo platform.  Why optical proof-of-work might work  There are many benefits of Bitcoin’s energy-intensive construction, namely robustness and anti-fragility, for example. That said, just because proof-of-work has worked well throughout Bitcoin’s history doesn’t mean that other ideas should be dismissed on sight. Bitcoin is a technology and technology changes.  First and foremost, lasers have shown promise in making computation more efficient. Photons enable a higher bandwidth than electrons when used in computers, which is why fiber internet (powered by flashing lights through glass cables) is faster than “regular internet.” While there is some disagreement about the feasibility of laser-based computers replacing semiconductor-based ones outright, optical computation could theoretically improve performance. Not to mention it fits the “laser eyes” meme popular among bitcoiners.  From a business perspective, oPoW makes a lot of sense. Instead of having capital expenditure and operating expenses taking an equal share in running a bitcoin mine, the cost shifts toward upfront investment. As a result, oPoW Bitcoin hardware would be markedly more expensive than current machines. That investment could be more easily financed, as lenders would have expensive equipment to collateralize against, and the cost of operations would be predictable because miners would be less sensitive to changes in energy availability and pricing. As such, cash flow pressures would be further eased as pricier equipment allows companies to run additional depreciation expense through their financial statements – an accounting trick, in practice, that nonetheless has real financial consequences.  Additionally, if the technology worked it would make energy a less important piece of Bitcoin’s composition. Notwithstanding the genuine benefits of an energy-intensive blockchain, a shift away from energy consumption would unquestionably ease political pressures, especially in the United States and the European Union, where a regulator has called for a ban on proof-of-work crypto mining and the parliament seriously considered such draconian measures (though ultimately rejected them). In this scenario, politicians and regulators might conceivably warm to Bitcoin if one of their major points of contention were to fall away.  Proponents of oPoW also argue that the shift away from energy dependency would improve the geographic distribution of bitcoin mining since it would no longer be concentrated in places with cheap, abundant energy. Instead, it would be mined wherever capital is available to be put to work to mine bitcoin. This would make Bitcoin less susceptible to aggressive swings in hashrate if, say, a coal mine explodes in China or the Kazakh government shuts down the internet.  Another argument oPoW proponents make is that the main source of Bitcoin’s network security comes from game theory as opposed to its energy use. The idea here is that bitcoin miners are compelled to be good actors; otherwise, their mining equipment and bitcoin would become worthless if a successful attack on the network were carried out. Right now, it is practically impossible to rent enough machines to control 51% of Bitcoin hashrate in order to attack the network, so an attacker would have to be a large owner of mining assets. With that in mind, shifting even more of the cost of mining to capital expenditure would increase the overall security of the system.  Lastly, a hard fork, or backward-incompatible code change, is not necessarily required for the Bitcoin network to test and eventually implement oPoW. It’s theoretically possible to add oPoW to Bitcoin as a soft fork, one that would allow users to run the old version without causing a split in the network. This is a potentially important point, as hard fork proposals have historically been highly contentious among bitcoiners. The most famous example is the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that stemmed from the virulent debate over block size and the block capacity enhancement of Segregated Witness in 2017.  In a soft-fork test phase, miners could ensure that most mining revenue would be earned using the current mining algorithm and a small percentage using oPoW. This could create sufficient incentive for oPoW to be stress-tested and to incentivize the manufacture of dedicated oPoW miners. If this test phase were successful, the breakdown could be adjusted over time such that oPoW accounts for up to 100% of Bitcoin’s mining activity. If unsuccessful, it could be phased out.  Why optical proof-of-work might not work  There are several arguments for why oPoW wouldn’t work for Bitcoin, however.  In the early days of bitcoin mining, we saw China dominate, owing to its glut of cheap energy. That cheap, abundant energy was a result of China looking to aggressively expand its economy and become energy independent. In doing so, China overbuilt its power generation capacity. Bitcoin mining ended up coalescing within China because China fulfilled bitcoin miners' needs for cheap input costs (i.e., electricity) to keep operating expenses down.  Simply shifting the cost curve to up-front cost might lead to the exact opposite centralization problem. Instead of most bitcoin mining ending up near cheap, abundant energy sources that popped up in developing, labor-abundant countries, like China, they might coalesce in developed, capital-abundant countries, like the United States. Specialized mining chips, or ASICs, already have a high-ticket price (over $10,000 for some models) – imagine if they were even more expensive. Requiring immense amounts of startup capital would have a meaningful impact on the feasibility of solo mining, which would itself be a blow to decentralization.  Next, oPoW may not work in practice. It’s still a theory, and although it has been put through the wringer that is the developer brain trust, no one knows how oPoW will behave and work when real people start using it and their money is at stake. Just like the lack of commercially successful implementations of proof-of-stake, oPoW is untested, particularly in Bitcoin. There is no guarantee that it will be secure enough for Bitcoin, and some of the comments on the BIP GitHub repository say as much. Developer Jeremy Rubin pointed out a potential design flaw that could give some miners an unfair advantage over the rest if it was exploited. As mentioned above, PoWx has launched oBTC, a Bitcoin look-alike that implements oPoW. But even if oBTC is successful within its own ecosystem, that doesn’t necessarily mean it would be successful in the context of Bitcoin itself.  Lastly and most importantly, oPoW would fundamentally change the way Bitcoin interacts with the rest of the world. Energy is an important part of Bitcoin now, and as Bitcoin grows it will become an important part of the energy system. On top of that, while capital is put to work in PoS systems and more of it would be invested upfront in an oPoW system, that capital could be put to work elsewhere. And that capital is far more easily moved than energy – given the technological cap on our ability to transport energy. (A bank wire transfer may seem slow, but have you tried building an oil pipeline?) It's potentially more wasteful to tie up capital in a PoS or similar system. Capital can be used almost anywhere on countless ideas or projects. The energy used by a PoW system, on the other hand, can’t be used as freely as capital.  Removing the energy-intensive component from Bitcoin could fundamentally change what it has become and what it may become.  What’s next for Bitcoin and oPoW?  oPoW remains one of more than 150 bitcoin improvement proposals being discussed by developers.  To receive a BIP number and be added to the repository, a proposal simply must follow the correct format and be technically possible to do. It doesn’t need broad support or even be a generally “good idea.”  Although oPoW may have to be implemented as a hard fork, that’s not to say that the update would be dead on arrival. We don’t know what improvements can be made to the proposal and we don’t know where Bitcoin will be tomorrow. So keep your laser eyes on this fascinating, if debatable, idea.

There's a ""significant risk"" that overseas stashes of digital assets could undermine existing requirements to share details of foreign bank accounts, intended to stop tax evasion and illicit finance, the OECD said in a consultation open until the end of April.  The proposals say crypto providers would have to share their users' names, addresses, Social Security numbers and details of transactions both between crypto and fiat and between different kinds of digital assets. Exchanges would also have to check the tax residences of new users and would be given 12 months to figure that out for existing clients.  The rules would also apply to both offline ""cold"" wallets and hot ones, as well as to services like crypto ATMs. But the OECD said it wants to exclude people simply validating blockchain transactions, as well as ""closed loop"" assets like vouchers used in a particular store. Potential new central bank digital currencies and other kinds of electronic money would be included under existing data-swapping rules, under the plans  The OECD says it will complete the rules based on peoples' comments and will update the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations in October.

42417127,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSJwOz,1647955861,Bitcoin Mining and ESG: A Match Made in Heaven,"Bitcoin mining hasn’t been able to shake its dirty reputation.  Producing the original cryptocurrency and keeping its proof-of-work network secure is an energy-intensive process – we all know that – and bitcoin’s carbon footprint is big. Very big. The stats are easy to find and used frequently in news stories: The biggest digital asset’s network consumes as much or more electricity in a year than many countries.  Most recently, evidence has shown that since China’s crackdown last year, mining bitcoin has become a less green business. This is because when most bitcoin mining took place in China, miners could take advantage of excess hydropower in the country’s Sichuan and Yunnan provinces during the rainy season – despite coal's abundance.  So, what can be done, then? Is bitcoin doomed to have a bad reputation in environmental, social and governance (ESG) circles forever?  Well, no, not exactly.  Zach Bradford is the CEO of CleanSpark, a Nasdaq-listed U.S. company that uses renewable sources to mine bitcoin. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Mining Week series.  For a start, bitcoin is in vogue, but so is ESG. Big investors are more interested in BTC than ever before. They also want to put their money in sustainable investments.  Not only are miners taking note – many want to be greener regardless to attract the right type of investors.  Shift to renewable energy  In order for new bitcoins to be minted, energy needs to come from somewhere. Lots of operations use energy from “dirty” sources, like coal, gas and petroleum. The latest data from the Bitcoin Mining Council shows that the majority of the bitcoin mining industry uses a sustainable electricity mix – a trend that has already increased.  Read More: What Does a Crypto Mining Farm Look Like? Striking Photos From Siberia to Spain  An increasing number of mining companies now use renewable sources, such as geothermal energy or solar power, to power their operations. Sustainable bitcoin mining is growing: Every operation in North America is at least offsetting some carbon emissions or actively trying to use more clean energy. Operations, such as my company’s, that use mainly carbon-free sources are becoming more common.  This trend is going to continue, we think, because it simply makes sense from a business perspective: Bitcoin miners will want the cheapest sources of energy available. And as clean energy gradually gets cheaper, mining operations will help subsidize green projects.  Non-renewable power is also becoming less attractive. In Kazakhstan, for example, the government welcomed bitcoin miners with open arms – and subsidized fossil fuels. The government then quickly changed course when the energy grid became overloaded, forcing miners out of the country. The situation is similar in Iran, where a combination of U.S. sanctions and illegal, unregulated mining has led the government to do a U-turn on welcoming the industry.  But renewables can solve a lot of these problems: Bitcoin mining will allow for a faster payback on solar or wind energy projects, and they will spring up in regions where before they were not economically feasible.  The bitcoin mining industry is not only on its way to a low-carbon future, but it also already produces less carbon than equally energy-intensive industries – such as aluminum production, which spews out up to 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.  Strengthening the power grid  Bitcoin’s other ESG selling point is that it gives back, too, with energy solutions – a little known fact is that bitcoin mining can actually strengthen a power grid. Not to mention the job creation and investments in regions with limited opportunities for economic development.  Read More: After Short-Lived Ban, City in Upstate NY Is Still Reckoning With Crypto Miners  For a start, operations in North America have already found solutions to the kind of problems that troubled Kazakhstan and Iran. On a chilly weekend back in January, New York-based miner Greenidge curtailed its mining operations to supply all of its electrical generation capacity to the New York Independent System Operator to help heat homes. It was able to do this in minutes. Prior to the commencement of its mining operations, the facility’s time from start-up to maximum generation capacity was approximately 14 hours.  And last month Texas-based bitcoin miners helped the state by powering down operations so the grid could function more efficiently ahead of icy weather.  Then there is the economic growth mining brings with it. Our company, for example, in September announced a five-year $145 million investment in Norcross, Georgia, the city where we have our latest data center. We will create over 20 skilled and highly skilled jobs with a yearly wage of approximately $50,000, and our investment in a $2 million power expansion along with local utility Georgia Power is expected to benefit power customers and community members living near the data center.  Other examples include a miner helping out its local fire department with a cash injection, a landfill closure and investing in once forgotten towns. If miners continue this trend across the U.S., the social change will be phenomenal.  We got our start as an energy technology company; we were focused on sustainability before we started mining bitcoin. We see how other operations can therefore make the most of how they mine to provide energy solutions. Mining companies, we believe, will only continue to incorporate sustainability into their everyday operations.  Bitcoin has already started to disrupt the landscapes of tech and finance as it becomes more mainstream. And just as ESG investing becomes the norm, bitcoin’s move to help people around the world achieve financial freedom will be a green and socially responsible one.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Cryptocurrencies ignore a hawkish tone from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as Goldman Sachs' first over-the-counter bitcoin option trade revives hopes of stronger mainstream participation in digital-asset markets.  Featured stories: Liquid staking giant Lido's LDO token doubles in less than a month. DASH's technical chart shows a bullish breakout.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Joe Vezzani, co-founder and CEO, LunarCRUSH  Marc Chandler, managing director and chief market strategist, Bannockburn Global Forex  Emin Gun Sirer, founder and CEO, Ava Labs  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Cryptocurrencies gained ground early Tuesday as recession fears and expectations of a Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut in 2023, coupled with renewed hopes of stronger institutional participation, overshadowed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish comments.  Bitcoin topped $43,000, hitting its highest level since March 3, while ether, the native token powering Ethereum's blockchain, rose over 4% to $3,050. The total crypto market capitalization increased by 3.7% to $1.9 trillion, according to data provided by the charting platform TradingView.  On Monday, New York-based digital-asset financial company Galaxy Digital announced a successful execution of its first over-the-counter (OTC) crypto transaction with Goldman Sachs in the form of a bitcoin non-deliverable option or NDO.  ""This marks the first OTC crypto transaction by a major bank in the U.S. as Goldman Sachs continues expanding its cryptocurrency offerings, demonstrating the continued maturation and adoption of digital assets by banking institutions,"" Galaxy said.  Galaxy's announcement is pivotal as products like non-deliverable options and non-deliverable forwards provide a window to traditional investors looking to gain exposure to crypto markets without holding the actual cryptocurrency. Thus, their availability could bring more mainstream investors to crypto markets.  ""NDFs and other OTC derivatives could be an important step to unlock demand from traditional investors looking to gain exposure in the space but have operationally challenged,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.  A non-deliverable option is a derivative contract cash-settled for the difference at its maturity rather than on the date of the actual delivery of the underlying asset. Similarly, a non-deliverable forward is a setup where parties agree to take opposite sides of a transaction settled for cash on the expiration date.  These instruments are quite popular in the foreign exchange markets, especially for clients operating in countries with a non-convertible or partially convertible currency like the Indian rupee. In such cases, foreign investors struggle to make a physical cash settlement.  Last year, B2C2, a crypto liquidity provider and over-the-counter trader, conducted its first transaction of a crypto non-deliverable forward with trading firm QCP Capital.  Latest Headlines  Ether Tops $3K For First Time in 2 Weeks  UK Advertising Regulator Issues 'Red Alert' Guidance on Crypto Ads  First Mover Asia: Why Bitcoin Started the Week Slowly; Ether Rises  Crypto Exchange Blockchain.com Acquires Altonomy’s OTC Desk  Lido Token Leads Crypto Market Higher  By Omkar Godbole  LDO, the native token of liquid staking giant Lido, was leading the broader market higher with a 16% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to data source Messari.  The token picked up a bid near $1.47 in the second half of February, even though the broader crypto market suffered losses on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and recently rose hit highs near $4. That's a 172% gain in less than four weeks.  According to observers, the token has benefitted from the rising popularity of liquid staking and the staking derivative token's adoption by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  ""It is likely due to increasing awareness of imminent Ethereum merge and the inclusion of Lido staked ETH in DeFi giant Aave as collateral,"" CK Cheung, an investment analyst at DeFiance Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  ""Lido is the dominant player in ether liquid staking, which is set to benefit from the Ethereum merge with higher staking yields. Having staked ETH included in Aave helps with capital efficiency,"" Cheung added.  Lido is one of the largest entities staking ether, with over 2.5 million ether deposited into the liquid staking protocol.  Liquid staking protocols allow holders of tokens to stake their assets without losing liquidity. Stakers receive a derivative token or liquid representation of the staked asset that can be used to earn extra yield elsewhere.

42375061,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5OKr,1647954092,"Cryptos Reclaim $2T Capitalization, Cardano’s ADA Leads Gains in Majors","A run in cryptocurrencies pushed the overall market capitalization back above the $2 trillion mark, a level last seen earlier this month before global markets slumped amid the war in Ukraine and tighter monetary policy in the West.  Cardano’s ADA led gains among major cryptocurrencies with a nearly 7% jump in the past 24 hours. Polkadot’s DOT surged 6.5%, while Ripple's XRP and Solana’s SOL each increased 5%. Bitcoin climbed above $43,000 at one point overnight, but has pulled back to $42,900 at press time, still ahead 4% for the day.  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to see major resistance at about the $44,500 level, having fallen back from there four times this year.  “Altcoins have a very strong correlation with BTC,” explained Egor Volotkovich, director at yield farming platform EVODeFi, in a Telegram message. “The growth surge in the cryptocurrency accounts for why these altcoins are also trading positively today.”  The move in bitcoin came even as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned on Monday about rising inflation and suggested the U.S. central bank is willing to raise rates more aggressively.  “A more aggressive increase in rates raises the chance of a recession, as it will slow growth more,” said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at crypto broker GlobalBlock, in an email to CoinDesk. “In my opinion, they will not raise rates by more than 25 basis points until September at the earliest, as the Federal Reserve will try their best to avoid a recession.”  Ether moves closer to staking  Ether (ETH) rose to and held above $3,000 on Tuesday as ""Kiln"" – expected to be the final testnet before Ethereum is “merged” to a staking network – was deployed last week.  Staking involves users locking up their tokens to validate transactions on the network, and stakers have locked up over 10 million ether on the Eth 2.0 deposit contract, as previously reported. Locked ether effectively takes freely traded ether from the open market while reducing circulating supply, possibly a bullish catalyst for the price.  ""Enthusiasm has started to mount again as Ethereum prepares for its long-awaited merge with Beacon chain, completing the protocol's transition to an energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism,” said Will Hamilton, head of trading at Trovio Capital Management, in an email to CoinDesk.  ""The reduction in emissions will be combined with a continuation of the Ethereum burn mechanism introduced with EIP-1559, the mechanism which destroys Ethereum correlated with the base fee of each transaction on the network,” he said.  ""(This) will radically change the supply dynamics of Ethereum such that total emissions may become deflationary, likely acting as a catalyst for upside price momentum during the second half of 2022,” Hamilton added.",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC | ETH,ADA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/22/cryptos-reclaim-2t-capitalization-cardanos-ada-leads-gains-in-majors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a69425a24dd58e7107ce6bb16a5e2df0d2fbef12-612x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Under the partnership, Ribbon Finance and Paradigm will work to build new risk products native to decentralized finance (DeFi) and continue to scale the protocol, including doubling down on the project’s multi-chain approach.  “[Ribbon] is a simple way for users to earn high yield on bitcoin, ether and USDC,” co-founder and CEO Julian Koh told CoinDesk in an interview. “We help users create exposure to expert, complicated financial strategies under the hood, but we make that experience really easy for users.”  In short, Ribbon Finance makes it easier for retail investors to benefit from the complicated world of crypto derivatives, Koh said.

Ribbon writes the calls on a weekly basis and collects the premium. Ribbon says investors can expect double-digit annual percentage yield (APY) from Theta Vault, according to its website.  Ribbon has $257.6 million in total value locked on the protocol, according to data from DeFi Llama.  “Structured products are one of the most important categories of DeFi,” Paradigm research partner and Chief Technology Officer Georgios Konstantopoulos said in a statement. “We were impressed by the execution of the Ribbon team and are excited to back Julian and (co-founder) Ken (Chan) to make Ribbon the market leader in their category  Looking forward  Koh said the focus over the next six months is expanding to additional blockchains. Ribbon Finance recently deployed on Avalanche and Solana and is focused on building its presence on those chains.  “We are just getting started,” said Koh. “The whole structured products industry in DeFi is less than a year old.

42375058,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5OH5,1647954000,Micro-Investing App Acorns Adds Bitcoin Exposure Option,"Savings and investing app Acorns has announced the option for customers to add bitcoin (BTC) exposure for long-term investing.  Acorns offers accounts that can be funded through automatic investments of spare change or deposits of as little as $5 at any time or on a recurring basis. The app recommends an investment plan for users based on goals, employment and income. Acorns offers five diversified portfolios of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.  With 4.6 million subscribers, it becomes the latest big name in fintech to inch its way into crypto.  “We’ve always been open-minded and flexible to the idea that as other asset classes mature and become something that we can deliver to customers, we would love to include that in the appropriate way,” Acorns Chief Investment Officer Seth Wunder told CoinDesk in an interview. “Cryptocurrency, specifically bitcoin, in our opinion has gotten to that place where it’s an acceptable piece of people’s portfolios.”  Acorns customers can invest up to 5% of their Acorns Invest portfolio in bitcoin through the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), a bitcoin futures fund that went public on the New York Stock Exchange last October.  Asked the reasoning behind the 5% exposure cap, Wunder said the math behind the decision was in line with how Acorns thinks about portfolio construction in general when it comes to balancing risk.  “When we look at the portfolios on a risk-adjusted basis, the [bitcoin exposure] range is really between 1% and 5%, depending on the portfolio that people are in. Most of our customers will fall into the 3% to 4% allocation,” he explained.  Wunder said Acorns would eventually add exposure to other cryptocurrencies in the future.  “As people choose to customize their portfolios with us in the future, we will give them the option in time to add other cryptocurrencies to the degree that they want,” said Wunder. “It will be a two-pronged approach: what they have in their portfolios and then what they choose to customize.”  The new program from Acorns follows a $300 million investment announced earlier this month including crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital.

42375054,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5OEZ,1647954000,Pipe Introduces Alternative Financing Product for Bitcoin Miners,"Pipe, a trading platform and technology company that was valued at $2 billion last year, is launching an alternative financing product for bitcoin mining hardware and hosting companies with recurring revenue.  The program, called “mine now, pay later,” will work as an alternative to traditional means of financing such as equity or debt, which are expensive for the companies and their shareholders.  “We’ve created a trading platform that allows companies to sell recurring revenue stream generating products and services to institutional investors,” Harry Hurst, co-founder and co-CEO of Pipe, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  The buyers of these contracts are institutional investors, including banks, hedge funds, pension funds and family offices, that have a fixed-income mandate and are looking for recurring payout generating assets, Hurst said.  A company signs contracts with its customers for a recurring payment schedule, and then puts those contracts into Pipe’s platform for trading, where investors will buy the contracts. In turn, the transaction becomes an instant source of funding for the company, which it can use to fund its growth without diluting the shareholders by offering equity or locking in an expensive debt facility.  “The financing solution is a little bit like hardware financing, but much more efficient because it's on a trading platform and diversified,” Hurst explained.  Pipe earns a fee on trades that get executed through its platform. The trade fee is up to 1% and varies depending on the trading volume, Hurst said.  Pipe has been working for several months with bitcoin mining service provider Compass Mining, which is the first company to broadly offer this new form of financing.  The funding alternative comes as cryptocurrency and broader markets have retreated from their peaks last year, damping euphoria among investors and making access to capital via traditional means harder and more expensive for bitcoin mining companies.  “Together with Pipe, we are accelerating the growth of bitcoin mining by democratizing access to the critical financing options that traditional banking institutions have ignored,” Compass Mining CEO Whit Gibbs said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/22/trading-platform-pipe-launches-alternative-financing-solution-for-bitcoin-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d32b292cf09a2aa4dced84c307c06967ea7a8ad1-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Founded in May 2019, FTX US currently offers more than 27 crypto-crypto trading pairs, while providing some of the most cost-effective deposit and withdrawal options in the industry. If you have ever invested or traded in the cryptocurrency markets before, you will understand how difficult it is to make a profit. The high levels of volatility and uncertainty can put even the most experienced traders to the test. As a result, it&apos;s easy to see why many people resent paying an extra fee to withdraw their assets since it eats away at their hard-earned profits. For example, Binance, one of the industry leaders, charges a fixed fee of 0.0005 BTC (roughly $21 at the time of writing) for each crypto withdrawal. This fee is charged regardless of the size of the withdrawal. In addition to regular network fees, Coinbase, another crypto exchange behemoth, charges its users a 1% fee to convert and withdraw their crypto to cash.

What critical points should you pay attention to in order not to fall into the trap and not to freeze capital for a long time? the main problem for buyers and the new growth trend is the $90 mark. Sellers took control of the range of this mark in January 2022. Since then, there has been a consolidation on small volumes in which buyers are behaving helplessly. https://www.tradingview.com/x/fb2omvqo/ Starting from 14 March, the situation on the AVAX market has changed. Buyers were able to absorb several weekly candles from sellers thanks to one weekly candle. However, globally, the price is still within the consolidation range of $55-$90. Therefore, local victories of market participants in this range in any case can not be perceived as signals for action. If during the trading week on 21 March, buyers will be able to break and fix above $90 - this will be a specific signal to investors to aggressively buy AVAX. The main target of this scenario is $236. Given how Bitcoin is held and the prospect of USDT dominance declining is high, this scenario is highly likely.

42375041,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5O0j,1647951327,Morgan Stanley Sees DeFi Remaining ‘Fairly Small’ as Growth to Slow,"The exponential growth seen in decentralized finance (DeFi) in recent years may be set to slow down because of hurdles such as regulation and overcollateralization, Morgan Stanley said in a research report.  Central bank easing programs forced investors to look for returns in new places, helping boost the total assets locked in DeFi to about $200 billion from around $600 million in 2020, the bank said. DeFi projects offer high returns to attract users, which in turn increase the value of the platform, it added.  DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without needing to use traditional intermediaries.  While the promise of no middlemen may seem appealing, and proponents pitch DeFi as a way of improving the existing financial system, Morgan Stanley says it hasn't seen much evidence that DeFi protocols are more efficient than the current system.  “Rather DeFi protocols often seem to us as a way to attract cash flow to enrich the protocol operators,” the report from last week said. “DeFi is hack-prone and at risk of financial crime given anonymity is a key feature.”  Lack of know-your-client (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) information will limit institutional adoption, the bank said. Introducing KYC/AML requirements will “force DeFi to be more centralized.”  KYC is the process of identifying and verifying a client’s identity, and is used to combat fraud as well as money laundering.  “Overcollateralization in lending/borrowing means DeFI lending doesn’t expand the money supply (for the same cryptocurrency), which means, without centralization, it will be harder for DeFi to be seen as an alternative to the current fractional reserve banking approach,” the note said. Therefore, the bank expects DeFi to remain fairly small in the coming years.  Regulators have been slow in catching up with the boom in DeFi, as protocols aren't controlled by a central entity and don’t have to be registered, but scrutiny will increase, the note added.

42390178,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bX2lKd,1647951300,What Is Cryptojacking? How to Protect Yourself Against Crypto Mining Malware,"Crypto hacks and scams come in many shapes. Some hackers directly break into wallets and steal money, others promise love to cheat you out of your coins, and some are so sneaky you rarely even notice your device has been compromised.  Cryptojacking falls into the latter category.  Cryptojacking is a type of cyberattack in which hackers exploit a device’s computing power without the owner’s authorization and use it to mine cryptocurrency. It became a widespread problem during the 2017 crypto boom as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' prices skyrocketed, making crypto mining a highly profitable business.  This explainer is part of CoinDesk's Mining Week series.  At one point, cryptojacking was the sixth most common malware globally, according to a report by Check Point Software, a Tel Aviv, Israel-based cybersecurity firm.  Lately, cryptojacking is having a renaissance. Google’s cybersecurity action team wrote in a report that 86% of all the compromised Google Cloud accounts were harnessed to mine cryptocurrencies.  It’s not just individuals that are targeted: Companies and public utilities are falling victim to cryptojacking, too. For example, Tesla was hit by cryptojacking malware that infected the automaker’s cloud and used the processing power to mine crypto in the background.  In early 2018, U.K. government websites and more than 4,000 others worldwide were exploited by cryptojacking viruses.  Read more: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  What is cryptojacking?  Think about cryptojacking like a parasite that sucks a computer's energy in secret. It’s delivered in the form of malicious software (malware) that infects your devices in order to use it for cryptocurrency mining. The target can be any device: computer, smartphone, even cloud servers – the latter is called cloud jacking.  The motive, unsurprisingly, is to make money. When a device is infected with cryptojacking malware, it takes control over the device’s computing power and channels a part of it to mine certain cryptocurrencies. Then, it sends any mined coins to the hacker’s wallet  There was a time when websites experimented with mining crypto using their visitors’ computers for extra revenue. This is called browser mining and it uses a simple web browser plugin that mines coins while you are on the website.  It is important to point out that unlike cryptojacking, browser mining is not a cybercrime. The big difference is whether the user is aware and gives consent to let the website use the device for cryptocurrency mining purposes. If it happens without authorization, then it is considered cryptojacking and a criminal act.  Some heralded browser mining as a new business model to monetize web traffic. Reputable digital news sites such as Salon and less reputable but much more popular site The Pirate Bay experimented with authorized “cryptojacking” as a complementary income stream. Even the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) used it in 2018 to harness supporters' computers to raise donations via cryptocurrency mining.  For a while, there was an entire service built on this. CoinHive provided lines of code that let webpages use their visitors’ devices to mine Monero, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.  Unsurprisingly, it did not take much time before it was used improperly. Webpages started to abuse the service to make extra revenue from visitors without their consent.  In fact, cryptojacking became so widespread that CoinHive came under significant scrutiny and was eventually forced to shut down in 2019.  Read more: Can You Still Mine Bitcoin and Other Crypto From Home?  How does cryptojacking work?  The reason cryptojacking is so prevalent is that the entry barrier is low and very profitable for hackers. Hackers only need a few lines of JavaScript code to sneak into a device that later will run the mining malware surreptitiously in the background.  Hackers may bait the user into clicking on a phishing email link to upload the malicious code onto their device.  Another possibility is to infect a website with a cryptojacking command line embedded in the HTML code that runs the program automatically once the user opens a specific webpage.  Some versions of cryptojacking malware are even capable of passing the virus on to other devices and infecting entire servers. In some instances, this can allow hackers to benefit from the huge computing resources of large server farms practically for free.  Most of the time, cryptojacking does not involve the theft or corruption of any personal data. Its main purpose is to gain access to your device’s computing power. Additionally, they are incentivized to stay under the radar. The longer the malware runs undetected on a computer the more revenue hackers receive from mining coins.  Read more: Crypto Romance Scams: Don't Fall for These Dating App Swindlers  Cryptojacking only exists with cryptocurrencies that use the proof-of-work consensus protocol. This subset of coins uses computational power to verify transactions and secure the network, and by doing that, they are rewarded with coins.  According to Interpol, the most notorious cryptocurrency that hackers mine is monero (XMR) because of the high level of anonymity it offers, making transactions difficult to trace. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest proof-of-work cryptocurrency, was once popular among cryptojackers, but the mining industry has grown so competitive with specialized machines and large warehouses that it makes little sense trying to mine it using other people's laptops.  How can you detect cryptojacking?  The goal of cryptojacking is to hide in the background for as long as possible to mine more cryptocurrency. Malware is designed to use just as much power as it needs, and it goes largely unnoticed.  However, there are certain signs that your computer has been infected by cryptojacking malware. Some examples are:  High CPU (central processing unit) usage  Device is slower and noisier  Overheating  Battery dies faster  Unexpected increases in electricity bills (for server farms)  It does not necessarily mean that your device mines crypto if you experience any of the signs above. Open Task Manager on PC or Activity Monitor on Mac to check out what programs are using your device’s computing power.  The best is to run a system check using antivirus software. Most cybersecurity programs are able to recognize, detect and quarantine cryptojacking malware, including:  Avira Antivirus  Avast  Bitdefender  Eset  Malwarebytes  For people who operate websites, you can hunt for suspicious lines in the HTML code or turn to programs that scan websites for malicious codes. Some examples for the latter include:  Malcure  Sucuri  How can you protect yourself against cryptojacking?  In the end, cryptojacking malware is not that much different from any other type of malware. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a long list of tips to protect your devices with technical details, but here are the basics to avoid getting infected by a cryptojacking cyberattack.  Install antivirus and malware protection software and keep them up to date.  Use ad blockers in your browser.  Avoid websites that are notorious for running cryptojacking scripts.  Disable Javascript in your browser.  Protect server parks with cybersecurity systems.

The four-week VeChain Fellowship certificate program includes entrepreneurship and blockchain fundamentals to help attendees launch their own Web 3 startup powered by the VeChain Thor public blockchain. Draper University will then select about a dozen members of the fellowship program to continue on through the VeChain Web 3 Accelerator, where each participant will receive $100,000 in funding in exchange for a 5% equity stake in their startup.  Draper University previously held similar programs in partnership with blockchain innovation lab Tezos Israel and finance-focused blockchain Algorand. The broader Draper Network of investment funds was an early backer of VeChain, which is a blockchain platform for supply chain and business process management.  Draper University CEO Asra Nadeem told CoinDesk in an interview that the center’s support doesn’t end on graduation day. A demo day held at the end of the program allows graduates to raise additional funding from outside investors. The graduates are also put in front of the roughly 18 global funds in the Draper Network for potential investment.  On the operational side, Draper University introduces graduates to potential customers through the Draper Network. The organization can also provide hiring assistance to connect graduate companies with technical, sales and marketing talent, said Nadeem.  The application period for the programs is now open. VeChain Fellowship program will run from April 18 through May 13, while the Accelerator will operate from July 11 to Sept. 7.

The money will go toward encouraging developers to build on the platform, according to an emailed statement on Tuesday.  “As a project, we are now ready for Fetch.ai’s technology to be scaled and to make it available for developers to deploy on any chain out there and provide cross-chain interaction and tools to build much more sophisticated logic using Fetch.ai’s technology,” Humayun Sheikh, the company’s CEO and founder, told CoinDesk.  Cambridge, U.K.-based Fetch.ai is a layer 1 blockchain that can act as a layer 2 network as well as an interchain bridge.  Layer 1 blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, run independently of other blockchains, while layer 2 chains aim to speed up transactions on existing blockchains.  The company uses autonomous economic agents, which it calls digital twins, to mimic real-world objects on the blockchain. The agents help users generate economic value and can be considered as a collaborative intelligence that helps users and businesses to make better decisions, Sheikh said.  The technology has been used to create a decentralized manufacturing marketplace for Festo, a German electromechanical systems manufacturer.  In March 2021, Fetch.ai raised $5 million from GDA Group, a Toronto-based digital asset firm.  The company also has a native token, FET.

42375046,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5O71,1647947085,Indian Crypto Industry Mulls Supreme Court Move as Tax Break Expectations Disappear,"India’s crypto industry has little or no hope the government will change its crypto-taxation stance, and is discussing a Supreme Court challenge to stave off the impending tax legislation.  CoinDesk spoke to several industry executives who believe the government is likely to stick to the tax proposals announced on Feb. 1.  “It seems so. This is what’s most realistic and probable. We could see changes in the fine print but not expecting any changes to the major policies,” said an executive of a major crypto exchange speaking on condition of anonymity. India’s proposed crypto tax rules are all set to become law before the end of the month.  Earlier this year, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a 30% capital gains tax on crypto, a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS), no offsetting of losses and taxes on gifts, too. There were some expectations the government could look at easing some of the burden on crypto gains, but those expectations are all but gone. However, there is still a glimmer of hope the 1% TDS could be reduced.  The industry as a whole had pushed for tax breaks during the informal discussions with the government held since the proposals were announced on Feb. 1. Executives of multiple exchanges confirmed that a number of meetings have taken place with the decision-makers.  “We had four meetings, three of which were to only submit information and discussion was not allowed. In one meeting there was a discussion and when we mentioned the issue of the 1% TDS we were told [we] should worry about GST (Goods & Services Tax) as that may be a bigger concern,” the founder of a leading Indian crypto exchange said.  The government is working to bring cryptocurrencies under the ambit of GST, an unnamed government official told the Press Trust Of India, the largest news agency in the nation. India levies an 18% tax on the services provided by exchanges, which could be increased to 28% as officials view crypto as something akin to gambling or horse racing.  Legal recourse on the table  In the event the government does not reduce the 1% TDS, the industry could challenge the taxes as a whole in the Supreme Court of India, several industry leaders told CoinDesk. At least three leading executives of different crypto exchanges confirmed that “the Supreme Court option has been discussed by exchanges but no decision has yet been taken.”  This legal last-resort would be in the form of a public interest litigation, or PIL.  “That is the legal way to go. But it won’t be a single exchange. It would have to be a collaborative effort, including crypto exchanges, [non-fungible token] platforms and blockchain companies since everyone will be affected,” said one of the three executives of different major crypto exchanges.  According to two executives from different exchanges, some entities may choose to sit out the legal challenge because they have adopted a “collaborative and symbiotic approach” to regulation as opposed to “an adversarial approach.” Another executive said that some exchanges, closely working with authorities, may continue to seek favorable regulation through “education and discussion.”  Several others believed the 30% tax is certainly unlikely to be reduced for the coming financial year but the government will have to tweak it soon. “Such a high tax rate will not work forever,” said a founder of an exchange.

42375045,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5O4V,1647946062,3 Reasons Bitcoin Is Staying Resilient to Powell's Hawkish Remarks,"Bitcoin (BTC) is trading higher a day after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled he's prepared to raise interest rates more aggressively.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value changed hands near $42,700 at press time, a gain of about 4% on the day. A drop to $41,000 after Powell's comments was short-lived, and the prices rose to $43,350 early today. Futures tied to the S&P 500 are pointing to a 0.32% gain. The index was little changed on Monday.  ""We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability,"" Powell said in a speech to the National Association of Business Economics on Monday. ""In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than a quarter-point at a meeting, or meetings, we will do so.""  Powell put a 50 basis point increase on the table for the coming months, having raised by 25 basis points last week, and signaled 175 basis points of increases for the entire year.  Risk assets' resilience may stem from investors' tendency to be forward-looking and the fact that Federal Reserve money tightening is already baked in. Let's take a look at each factor in detail.  1) Fed tightening is priced in  Concerns over Fed tightening first gripped markets in early November. Since then, rates traders have gone from pricing in three hikes for this year to seven, 25 basis-point increases.  Before Russia invaded Ukraine, markets foresaw the Fed raising rates by 50 basis points in March. Now, traders are factoring in a 50 basis point hike in May. Bitcoin has dropped 38% since mid-November.  In other words, Powell's hint of aggressive rate hikes is hardly surprising. If anything, last week's hawkish Fed meeting and Powell's comments on Monday confirmed investor expectations and appear to have removed a significant amount of uncertainty from the market.  ""Investors hate uncertainty more than they hate bad outcomes. And that's exactly where markets stand today,"" Jeff Dorman, CIO at digital asset management firm Arca, said in a blog post published Monday.  ""The 'storm before the calm' had been brewing, and it looks like the storm has finally passed. Since markets are forward-looking and have long memories, investors had already priced in a 3-year tightening cycle before it even started. Looking beyond that is a world with much less unknown. That’s a good thing."" Dorman wrote.  2) Recession concerns: a blessing in disguise  Forward-looking markets could be focusing on a recession and the prospect of the Fed returning to expansionary monetary policy to support the economy. According to the Fed Funds futures, interest-rate derivatives traders are pricing a rate cut as early as 2023.  The U.S. Treasury yield curve, represented by the spread between 10- and two-year bond yields, is just 17 basis points short of inversion, a recession indicator. Inversion occurs when the two-year yield rises above the 10-year yield.  ""The inversion of the curve signals to investors that the Fed may compromise in the future, so it's a good sign in part,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin, said in a Telegram chat.  ""Once the economy is in trouble, the Fed can only turn back to the road of quantitative easing. Based on current macro data, the current economic situation can support the Fed's hawkish policy, but the maximum period will not exceed two years,"" Ardern said.  The best time to buy the dip in risk assets is when the Treasury curve inverts to the maximum, according to Ardern.  3) Pre-options expiry bump  Bitcoin's tendency to gravitate toward the so-called ""max pain point"" – the strike price at which the most open options contracts expire worthlessly – ahead of the quarterly options expiry could be helping the cryptocurrency hold ground in the wake of Powell's comments.  ""When the quarterly delivery of derivatives is approaching, in the case of large transaction size, the actual price will tend to come to the max pain point and be firmly anchored,"" Ardern noted. ""A similar situation happened once on Dec. 31 last year.""  Option contracts worth $3.56 billion are set to expire this Friday, data tracked by Skew show, and the max pain is $41,000, according to data sourced from Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by trading volumes and open positions.  According to theory, the max pain point acts as a magnet for spot prices as expiration approaches. That's because option sellers, mostly institutions, sometimes try to push prices closer to the max pain point to inflict maximum loss on options buyers.  Since early 2021, bitcoin has seen increased volatility ahead of quarterly option expiries, with prices pulling back or bouncing toward the max pain point in the lead up to the settlement, only to resume the prior trend after expiry.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/22/3-reasons-bitcoin-is-staying-resilient-to-powells-hawkish-remarks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c94e8d8d4779b7be78423a5f92ab85664a4a2b82-1660x878.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will the breakout rally reach the $0.15 mark? Key technical points: XEM coin price outperforms the 50-day EMA. In addition, the altcoin price surpasses the $0.10 mark. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of NEM is $71 Million, marking a 273% rise. Past Performance of XEM The XEM coin price displays an impulsive boost in buying pressure near the support level of $0.090. The recovery cracks above the $0.10 mark, the 50-day EMA, and the long-coming resistance trendline with an 18% jump last week. The trendline breakout comes with the bullish engulfing candlestick of 7.80% and shows a retest candle in action. Source-Tradingview XEM Technical Analysis XEM coin price shows a high possibility of a post-retest uptrend continuation which may reach the $0.12 or $0.15 mark. Moreover, the increased buying pressure evident by the 270% jump in trading volume increases the chances of a bull run. The crucial EMAs (50, 100, and 200) sustain the bearish alignment as buyers transcend the 50-day EMA and prepare to head higher after retest. However, the 50-day EMA breakout teases a bull run to the 200-day EMA, accounting for an almost 30% price jump.

At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) is now up nearly 6.4% over the last 24 hours at the current price of $3,031 per CoinGecko. The second-largest cryptocurrency moved back above $3,000, which it last touched on February 17. In fact, on March 15, more than 180,000 ETH were withdrawn from centralized exchanges, indicating a decline in the number of coins available for sale in the market. The cryptocurrency also rose 17% last week, the biggest gain in seven weeks, data indicates. That matches the wider cryptocurrency market cap increase seen over the last 24 hours, as it currently sits above $2 trillion in total. Anticipating Ethereum 2.0 Upgrade The price rally comes on the heels of Ethereum enthusiasts eagerly waiting for the Ethereum 2.0 update that is expected later this year, which brings the proof-of-stake (POS) system to the platform. The upgrade will shift Ethereum away from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more environmentally-friendly proof-of-stake (PoS). Last week, Ethereum developers successfully tested the long-awaited merge of the network&apos;s proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chains, dubbed Eth 2.0, which will allow users to hold coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support network operations in return for newly minted coins.The post Ethereum (ETH) Rallies Back Above $3,00...",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/ethereum-eth-rallies-back-above-3000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Decentralizing these investment vehicles introduces modularity that would otherwise remain inaccessible. Struct Finance has secured $3.9 million in seed funding to usher in the era of decentralized structured products. Takes A Different Approach It is no secret that decentralized finance remains one of the most appealing concepts of blockchain and cryptocurrency today. The industry has grown from small beginnings and now represents over $220 billion in Total Value Locked. Users are drawn to these protocols, products, and services in search of high yields, composability, and the removal of intermediaries. However, there is a need for ongoing innovation in the space, especially for institutional-grade products. Decentralized structured products may be the next catalyst to fuel broader mainstream DeFi participation. Unlike their traditional counterparts, the products under the Struct Finance banner give users customization options. For example, a user can customize interest rate instruments and compose various options in the ecosystem to create more complex products. In addition, there are numerous investment options, which users can custom-tailor to their risk appetite.

Over time, more use cases for crypto come up to sustain their growth and lead the world to the next finance phase.

Since the IRS did not provide this guidance, many taxpayers opted to report income when they received rewards. Crypto Staking on Blockchain PoS networks are decentralized, so they do not have a central authority to oversee transactions. To ensure that transactions are conducted properly, they rely on a consensus mechanism that enables participants to verify transactions. Notably, validators provide the consensus of the PoS system.

42422852,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qTph,1647907260,UK Advertising Regulator Issues 'Red Alert' Guidance on Crypto Ads,"The U.K.'s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has issued an enforcement notice to over 50 companies that have advertised cryptocurrency services, advising them to review their ads to make sure they comply with new guidance.  The advertising regulator told CoinDesk the list of 50 includes all firms that have previously been subject to ASA rulings. Among these companies are Coinbase (COIN), eToro, Luno and Crypto.com.  ""This is a ‘red alert’ priority issue for us and we’ve recently banned several crypto ads for misleading consumers and for being socially irresponsible,"" the ASA said.  The new guidance requires advertisers to clearly state that crypto is unregulated in the U.K. and that the ""value of investments are variable and can go down."" Additionally, ads must not ""state or imply that investment decisions are trivial, simple, easy or suitable for anyone"" or""imply a sense of urgency to buy or create a fear of missing out, or that investments are ‘low risk’.""  Companies advertising crypto services have until May 2 to ensure their ads meet this guidance, after which non-compliant advertisers will be reported to the financial watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  In January, the FCA announced its plans to tighten oversight of crypto advertising after it was granted additional powers by the government to regulate the industry.  CoinDesk has contacted Coinbase, eToro, Luno and Crypto.com for comment on the new guidance, but had not received a response by press time. Luno, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.
