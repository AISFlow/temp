42424351,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2niVh,1636069870,Day 4 of Kleiman v. Wright: Craig Wright’s Testimony Delayed,"MIAMI — Craig Wright – the Australian computer scientist best known for his widely disputed claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin – is now expected to testify in a Miami court on Monday.  Wright was initially slated to testify Thursday, according to an earlier schedule drawn up for the jury by Judge Beth Bloom of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  However, Wright’s defense team’s questioning of Ira Kleiman, the plaintiff in the case, went all day Thursday and is expected to spill over into late Friday morning.  After Kleiman’s testimony wraps, the plaintiffs are expected to introduce pre-taped video testimony from two witnesses, including Wright’s ex-wife, Lynn Wright.  Kleiman is suing Wright for what he alleges to be his brother Dave’s share of proceeds derived from business arrangements between the two men, including intellectual property and bitcoin that Ira says they mined together.  Ira based these claims on information he received from Wright and others following Dave’s death in April 2013, as well as emails and other documents.  However, it is unclear whether Wright has access to any of the alleged 1.1 million bitcoin (which would be worth over $67 billion).  Much of it is in wallets associated with Nakamoto and other sources, but Wright has never been willing or able to demonstrate he controls the wallets of Bitcoin’s creator.  Andres Rivero, lead counsel for Wright’s defense, focused his cross-examination of Ira on his strained relationship with his brother Dave before the latter’s death, in an attempt to depict Ira as purely motivated by financial gain.  The defense also sought to downplay Dave’s purported role in the conception of Bitcoin by establishing a timeline of his poor physical health in 2008, the year the Bitcoin white paper was published.  Under cross-examination by Rivero, Kleiman said he erased and overwrote data on all but one of the 14 devices that were recovered among David’s belongings, and threw another away. The defense argues that if Dave had any bitcoin or other information and Ira couldn’t find it, that’s his fault.

Their entrance into the space has been highly lauded as this will provide some much-needed diversification in the space. Activities are already underway on the Solana blockchain. However, Cardano has not had much in the way of activities on its blockchain since the launch of smart contracts capability. This has mainly been due to the fact that smart contracts capabilities debuted on the network less than two months ago and it will take some time for developers to test and deploy their applications on the blockchain. Cardano is behind its competitors due to this delay but is no doubt a contender in the space. The blockchain has maintained its position as the second leading smart contracts platform.

Bitcoin revenue and gross profit decreased in the third quarter versus the second quarter, however, Square said, citing the “relative stability in the price of bitcoin, which affected trading activity compared to prior quarters.”  Square also noted bitcoin revenue and gross profit may fluctuate in future quarters given changes in customer demand and bitcoin’s market price. It said that may be particularly the case “as we lap strong growth rates on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2020.”  Square’s total net revenue was $3.84 billion in the third quarter, up 27% year over year, while gross profit was $1.13 billion, up 43% year over year.  On its third quarter conference call, the company said it will release a white paper on Nov. 19 regarding TBD, its new division focused on creating an open developer platform to build a decentralized bitcoin exchange.  Square also said on the call that the company doesn’t plan on offering users other cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin. The company said it is focused on building its hardware wallet and continuing plans to allow individuals and businesses to mine bitcoin. CEO Jack Dorsey initially alluded to the latter plan in a tweet several weeks ago.  Shares of Square were down about 4.9% in post-market trading following the release of its Q3 results.

42424368,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2niph,1636057576,Market Wrap: Analysts See Further Upside in Ether as Bitcoin Stalls,"Bitcoin has traded mostly sideways over the past two weeks, prompting some traders to consider alternative cryptocurrencies such as ether for greater profit potential.  “Our models are still full risk-on ETH (whereas our bitcoin model started reducing exposure last week) but we are starting to see some slowing in conviction buying,” Ben McMillan, chief investment officer at quantitative research firm IDX Insights, wrote in a research report.  BTC’s price has been roughly flat over the past week, compared with a 4% rise in ETH and a 23% rise in Solana’s SOL token over the same period.  “Investors are likely looking for the next catalyst for another leg higher, but the absence of such is likely to leave bitcoin vulnerable to a break below $60,000,” Daniela Hathorn, an analyst at DailyFX, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “Typically, we tend to see BTC sell off a bit after breaking to a new all-time high as traders front-run the hype,” crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote in a blogpost on Thursday, referring to traders dealing on advance information .  But some analysts expect further upside despite signs of slowing price momentum.  “With MVRV [bitcoin’s market value relative to its realized value] currently trading at 2.72, far off from its recent peak of 3.96″ in February, crypto investment firm StackFunds said in a report it is “expecting further room for growth as [MVRV] retests the 4.0 handle,” along with blockchain metrics showing strong bitcoin accumulation.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $61,162, -2.95%  Ether (ETH): $4,486, -3.17%  S&P 500: $4,675, +0.32%  Gold: $1,793, +0.95%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.52%  Why this bull run is different  Bitcoin’s two bull runs of 2021 have differed from those in past years. One key distinction has been decreased volatility expectation, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported.  This metric, which shows the cryptocurrency’s expected price swings, did not spike when bitcoin’s price hit record highs in April and then in October, indicating that bitcoin may be evolving into a more mature investment asset.  Prior to 2021, bitcoin’s three-month implied volatility (IV) – investors’ expectation of how turbulent prices will be over the ensuing three months – spiked during both bull and bear runs, according to data from crypto data firm Skew. But this year, a similar spike only occurred when the market crashed in May.  Ether to extend outperformance  Some analysts remain bullish on ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The price reached an all-time high around $4,600 on Wednesday.  FundStrat, a global advisory firm, expects ether to rally as high as $4,951 “with little to no resistance” after outperforming bitcoin recently and breaking through September highs.  “While weekly and monthly momentum do show overbought conditions, this won’t be a big deal until near-term technicals begin to show evidence of upside exhaustion,” Mark Newton, FundStrat’s global head of technical strategy, wrote in a research note on Wednesday.  Newton also sees further upside in ETH relative to BTC (ETH/BTC price ratio) if price resistance near 0.08 is broken. “At present, the most likely outcome is a bit more outperformance, followed by a stall out,” Newton wrote.  Altcoin roundup  SHIB slumps amid speculation about large investor’s holdings: An increased SHIB sell-off on centralized exchanges occurred as the hype around the meme token has been tapering off, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported. The canine-themed token has logged losses for three consecutive days after a SHIB whale (or large holder of the token) made a move on their holdings of 40 trillion SHIB, which was worth roughly $2.8 billion at the time.  Ethereum alternatives and gaming tokens outperform: Tokens associated with Solana and Polkadot – both alternatives to the Ethereum blockchain – are outperforming along with gaming tokens like Axie Infinity’s AXS, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported. “Currently, it is a very mixed market, with coins moving pretty uncorrelated from each other,” said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG. This presents more trading opportunities, Heusser said.  Enjin forms $100M fund to support Metaverse projects: The Efinity Metaverse Fund will aim to support work on metaverse projects on Enjin and Polkadot, CoinDesk’s Jamie Crawley reported.

Open Interest, Funding Rates, And LTH-SOPR May Signal Whether A Peak Vs A Shakeout As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a combination of different on-chain indicators may be able to identify whether a high means the price is forming a peak or if it&apos;s just a shakeout. The relevant Bitcoin indicators here are the open interest, the funding rates, and the LTH-SOPR. Before considering the trend of each, here are some quick explanations of what these metrics are. The open interest is an indicator that shows the total amount of open positions currently on derivative exchanges. It includes both long and short positions. Funding rates are the periodic payments that futures traders make between each other. Positive values of the metric mean long traders are currently paying a premium to keep their position while negative ones mean short traders are the ones paying. Finally, the LTH-SOPR, or the Long-Term Holder SOPR, highlights the degree of profit taking from long-term holders. SOPR here stands for Spent Output Profit Ratio.

42421681,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9Kf,1636052276,Will Bitcoin Win When the Fed Stops Buying Bonds?,"There are things out of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s control. The central bank has a dual congressional mandate to maintain the U.S. dollar’s long-term value and achieve maximum employment, but it’s dealing with a mix of uncertainties as it pursues those goals.  Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced the monetary body will begin scaling back its historic asset purchasing program, one of the key levers it pulled to support and stimulate the economy during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Beginning in November, the Fed will purchase $10 billion fewer Treasury bonds and $5 billion fewer mortgage-backed securities (MBS) each month until the $120 billion program is depleted sometime in mid-2022.  The Fed left itself some wiggle room to pause or accelerate this “taper” depending on extenuating circumstances. It also won’t consider raising interest rates while still buying bonds – more flexibility.  It cannot be overstated how experimental this monetary outlay is, especially as it begins to wind down. Known as “quantitative easing,” or QE, the bond buying program has more than doubled the Fed’s balance sheet (now valued above $8.6 trillion). It has had broad effects on the labor market, asset prices and the dollars in your pocket.  Inflation is running hotter than at any point over the past 30 years, and consumer prices have climbed 4.4% in aggregate, double the 2% target the Fed has long targeted. Conflicting signals point to both a super-tight and super-loose labor market simultaneously. The quits rate, number of job openings, and salary and benefits paddings are all atypically high (pointing to a tight labor market). Yet, there are 5 million fewer people working than in February 2020.  “We have high inflation and we have to balance that with what’s going on in the employment market,” Powell said. “It’s a complicated situation.”  Considering the extent to which market watchers hang onto Fed-speak, Powell deserves credit for his consistent messaging. His magic voice is essentially the one thing completely under his control. Although the taper signals an end to easy money, markets weren’t spooked yesterday: the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 all closed trading at all-time highs.  Powell has been consistent on letting the economy “run hot,” and has made good on giving markets advance warning of policy changes. His colleagues at the Fed were unanimous in parking the benchmark interest rate between zero to 0.25% (though that, too, is subject to change, “depending”). Where Powell has changed perspective is only in a matter of degree – instead of saying elevated inflation is “transitory,” or a matter of specific coronavirus-related bottlenecks, he said mitigating factors were – shipping constraints aren’t forever.  Read more: Federal Reserve to Taper Money Printing That Fueled Bitcoin Bets  Indeed, supply-chain logjams, superconductor shortages and strong buying demand from American consumers are all things Powell watches without having much say in the matter. Same with COVID-19 caseloads, lockdowns and market psychology.  So when it comes to tapering, or when or by how much to lift interest rates, it’s important to remember we’re watching a human being. You can disagree with his policies – and, boy, many do – but that’s an issue whenever we invest any one person with such authority.  Two sides of the coin  Bitcoin, as an alternative monetary base layer, stands apart from this human drama. A grand experiment born from the 2008 recession that was supercharged by the pandemic, most policy decisions for Bitcoin have already been made and hardcoded. It is hard where the dollar is soft. Subject to reason, where the dollar is man.  But it’s also fully integrated into the global economy and the bitcoin currency’s price is also subject to Fed decisions. Bitcoin has benefited over the past several months of QE from the belief that it is an inflation hedge. Smart money – the Ray Dalios of the world – bought into it and profited.  However, it’s unclear how the Fed will manage inflation going forward. For now, Powell has signaled that he’s choosing full employment over risks of elevated prices.  “We don’t think it is a good time to raise interest rates because we want to see the labor market heal further,” Powell said. “The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability.”  When the Fed starts to raise interest rates to cool the economy it could have a negative impact on bitcoin’s price. “To the extent BTC is a hedge like gold, I think it could suffer,” the economist Claudia Sahm told me in a private message.  Then again, there’s also a belief that the Fed has already let inflation run too far and has limited means to cap it. In the short term, if Powell is to remain true to his word and finish buying bonds before raising rates, the agency doesn’t have a tool to pull in inflation until at least Q2 2022. A hyperinflationary environment, or even just fears of that happening, could drive money into bitcoin.  “On the other hand, the effects of the largest QE in history may lead to the largest inflation in history, regardless of the Fed attempting to scale back. If this happens, we expect demand, and prices, for bitcoin to rise to new all-time highs,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk yesterday.  It remains to be seen how transitory inflation is and will be.  Transitory  It’s worth noting as well that Powell’s term as Fed chairman is ending in February 2022 (though his term as a Fed governor ends in 2028), and the Biden administration hasn’t given a clear signal as to whether he’ll stay on at the job. While Fed officials were in lock-step to begin phasing out asset purchases, many have contradictory views about how to manage (and even measure) inflation.  So will Powell’s mandate continue? Will bitcoin succeed in a world where the U.S. isn’t buying bonds? It’s just another human uncertainty.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/04/will-bitcoin-win-when-the-fed-stops-buying-bonds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7ba6eb4be773147172889e24ce693790e7d0a18-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The analyst also noted that if blockchain technology disrupts the conventional finance sector by eliminating the need for intermediaries, it can also potentially trigger the end of the “dollar paper standard.”  Wood said he will be adding another 5% to his bitcoin exposure, bringing it to 10%, while cutting 5% exposure to gold in his global, long-only asset allocation portfolio recommendation for his U.S.-dollar-based pension funds.  His portfolio recommendation currently has 40% gold, 30% Asia (excludingJapan) equities, 20% unhedged gold mining stocks and 10% bitcoin exposure.  Wood is not putting ethereum in the fund portfolio, however, because he doesn’t think it is a “store of value” asset.

On the daily chart, SHIB’s price has fallen by more than 15% on Thursday, according to data from Coinbase and TradingView. The token ended Wednesday down 22% – the biggest single-day drop since Sept. 10 when it declined a whopping 87.6%.  The canine-themed token has logged losses for three consecutive days, after a SHIB whale (large holder of the token) made a move on their holdings of 40 trillion SHIB, which was worth roughly $2.8 billion at the time. The move triggered speculation on where the SHIB trillions would end up.  At the time of publication, the whale had relocated the SHIB to four addresses, where the tokens remain, according to Etherscan There was no other indication that the SHIB whale was moving the tokens to the open market.  While the SHIB whale’s motivation for moving the tokens is unclear, the market reacted strongly: SHIB’s price has been dropping since then, as SHIB flows to centralized exchanges spiked, according to data from Santiment, a crypto research firm.  “There ... seems to be an increase in SHIB sell-offs,” Dino Ibisbegovic, a market analyst at Santiment, told CoinDesk.  Roughly 1.36 trillion more SHIB flowed to centralized exchanges than from them in the past 24 hours, while the amount of deposit addresses of SHIB reached 1,641 on Wednesday, a 142% increase since Nov. 1, according to Ibisbegovic.  According to Santiment, a spike in a token’s deposit addresses to centralized exchanges may indicate a rise in short-term selling pressure, as more tokens become available on the exchanges.  Meanwhile, the number of unique addresses interacting with SHIB token have fallen by 66.1% since peaking at around 107,000 on Oct. 28, according to Santiment. On Oct. 28, there were 53,546 addresses interacting with SHIB for the first time, but the new addresses holding SHIB today have dropped by more than 64%.  “The hype has certainly died down in the past week,” Ibisbegovic said.  Santiment’s data also shows that more than one SHIB whale has moved their SHIB holdings: SHIB transactions worth at least $100,000 also started increasing on Wednesday.

The firm will use the funds to expand its team, scale operations and bring new game developers to its non-fungible token (NFT) platform.  Mythical has now raised over $270 million, with $225 million of that total raised in 2021. The startup closed its $75 million Series B round in early June.  Other participants in the Series C round included Binance, FTX, D1 Capital, RedBird Capital and The Raine Group. Galaxy Interactive was among the returning investors.  A number of entertainment brands and personalities also joined the funding, including the investment vehicles of the National Football League, the band The Chainsmokers and OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder.  Mythical Games opened early access for its Blankos Block Party game earlier this year. Blankos Block Party is an open-world multiplayer game focused on custom art and design, building and exploration, and curating a collection of Blankos, which are digital vinyl toys. Each Blanko is a NFT that players can sell to each other for real money on the Mythical Marketplace.  Mythical also plans to license its Mythical Marketplace and Mythical Economic Engine to other developers. Earlier this week, Mythical announced its first developer partners. The company will help fund three new play-to-earn projects for its platform: an action strategy game from publisher Abstraction Games; a racing game from Creative Mobile, the studio behind the popular Nitro Nation franchise; and a digital trading card game developed by CCG Lab.  “Players spend billions of dollars on digital assets each year, but the value of their collections has been locked away from them. Utilizing NFTs in gaming creates a whole new set of game design principles built around scarcity vs. inflationary free-to-play economies,” said John Linden, co-founder and CEO of Mythical Games, in the company’s press release.  “Mythical Games played a formative role in the development of play-to-earn concepts, and has clearly established itself as a top player among gaming technology studios, attracting mainstream players with its distinctive design and quality gameplay,” said a16z general partner Arianna Simpson in the release.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | BNB,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/04/a16z-leads-150m-round-for-nft-game-platform-mythical-games-at-125b-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1577e7815446e4aeab2139ca997f0e41ae370d0-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Short-term buyers have been active on pullbacks, which suggests downside could be limited into Asian trading hours.  Upside momentum is slowing after BTC made an all-time high around $66,900 last month. It appears that buyers were quick to take profits around the price high, especially given short-term overbought signals on the charts.  BTC was trading around $61,500 at press time and is down about 1% over the past 24 hours.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is not yet oversold, which suggests BTC could see further downside toward the $58,000-$60,000 support zone.  If buyers fail to hold $60,000, the next level of support is seen around $53,000-$54,000 (a near-10% decline from current levels), which is also at the 50-day moving average.  The weekly RSI is approaching overbought territory, similar to April and September, which preceded a downturn in BTC’s price.

TradeStation began offering crypto trading to its customers in May 2019, and last year partnered with exchange ErisX to integrate ErisX’s order book into its subsidiary, TradeStation Crypto.  The SPAC transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022. TradeStation will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “TRDE.”  The transaction values the combined company at an implied pro forma enterprise value of approximately $1.43 billion. After the deal closes, TradeStation parent company Monex will own approximately 80% of the combined company. TradeStation’s existing management team will remain in place.  The deal will provide $316 million of cash before paying expenses, assuming there’s no redemption of any public shares of Quantum FinTech. The total includes $201 million in cash held in Quantum FinTech’s trust account and $115 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE), or a private sale of Quantum stock. The PIPE includes $50 million from Monex and $50 million from Galaxy Digital, plus investments from XBTO Ventures, LLC and Appian Way Asset Management.  The combination structure involves a merger between a new subsidiary of TradeStation and Quantum Fintech, with Quantum becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of TradeStation. Each Quantum FinTech share held by the PIPE investors and sponsors will be exchanged for one common share of TradeStation. Quantum shareholders who don’t redeem the public shares will receive more than one TradeStation share.  “There are numerous reasons why TradeStation is, in our judgment, the most attractive company we looked at in the fintech/financial services sector, and we looked at quite a few,” said John Schaible, chairman and CEO of Quantum FinTech, in a press release. “TradeStation owns its core trading platform technology, and it executes and clears its customer trades across all of the major asset classes it offers.

42396601,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4XWr,1636036589,Ethereum Alternatives and Gaming Tokens Outperform BTC and ETH,"Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were little changed over the past 24 hours, though currencies associated with Solana and Polkadot – both alternatives to the Ethereum blockchain – were outperforming along with gaming tokens like Axie Infinity’s AXS.  Bitcoin was down 2% in the last 24 hours. The price briefly dipped Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s announcement of a plan to taper, or cut back, its $120 billion monthly in bond purchases starting this month.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value dropped as low as $60,530 at around 6:00 p.m. UTC on Wednesday, but recovered shortly and traded back above $63,000.  “The fact that bitcoin is consolidating in a range just under its all-time high is significant,” said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics. “This sets a strong support for the next move upwards. The longer it remains in place, the more confidence the market has that it will hold.”  The number of bitcoins on exchanges is at its lowest in three years, suggesting investors are not willing to sell.  “Supply on exchanges continues to fall as fast as the asset’s fundamentals continue to improve, inviting a bullish outlook,” said Deane.  Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, reached an all-time high on Wednesday, hitting $4,628. Ether is up 28% on the month, but down 1.5% on the day, trading around $4,500.  “This is a reasonable price correction,” said Du Jun, co-founder of Huobi Group, in an email to CoinDesk. “The price is still at a high level, and the trading volume is at an average level.”  “Currently, it is a very mixed market, with coins moving pretty uncorrelated from each other,” said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG. This presents more trading opportunities, Heusser said.  With gas fees rising on Ethereum by 2,300%, investors have piled into coins associated with so-called layer 2 solutions that offer faster and cheaper transactions, according to a separate CoinDesk report.  SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, hit an all-time high of $246 on Wednesday and the token is up 5% in the last 24 hours. Polkadot’s DOT is up 7% and Cardano’s ADA remains little changed in the last 24 hours.  “There’s a bunch of ETH look-alikes,” said Paul Eisma, head of trading for the crypto firm XBTO. “Solana has definitely taken the lead.”  All-time highs for SOL and ETH helped push the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies above $2.75 trillion for the first time on Wednesday, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Play-to-earn tokens also experienced an uptick in price over the last 24 hours. Axie Infinity’s AXS token is up 11%, trading just below its all-time high of $162, and The Sandbox’s SAND reached an all-time high on Tuesday.  This sector as a whole is expected to continue to benefit from the inflow of capital and the growing interest from mainstream vendors, according to Denis Vinokourov, an independent crypto analyst. He said in a LinkedIn post that “a whole host of names are trying to come up with their own versions of ‘metaverse’ and incentive programs.”  Vinokourov attributes Axie’s latest gains to the launch of Katana, a decentralized exchange that allows users to easily swap between the various assets within the Axie Infinity ecosystem. Users can now trade among Axie Infinity, Smooth Love Potion (SLP), USD coin (USDC) and wrapped ETH (WETH), according to the press release.",NEUTRAL,AXS | BTC | ETH | SOL,AXS | BTC | ETH | SOL | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/04/ethereum-alternatives-and-gaming-tokens-outperform-btc-and-eth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0225cc42d0d9fdf5558b4fd526a30de59db06dcb-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Faraway said in a press release Thursday the other participants in the funding round included a16z, Sequoia Capital, Pantera Capital, Jump Capital and Solana. Faraway raised an $8 million seed round earlier this year, which was also led by Lightspeed.  The investment will be used to integrate the Solana blockchain into Faraway’s most popular gaming title, “Mini Royale,” a battle royale-based first-person-shooter game similar to Counter-Strike.  The browser-based game will utilize an in-game economy compatible with FTXPay and Solana non-fungible tokens (NFT), becoming the first multiplayer video game to do so, according to the press release.  With Web 3 gaming still in its infancy, investors have clamored to fund up-and-coming studios that specialize in virtual reality and play-to-earn structures.  Read More: Sequoia Games Brings Augmented Reality to Board Games Using Algorand Blockchain  The multiplayer gaming sector has yet to see the same attention from investors, however, despite having a long history of in-game economies centered around digital collectibles.  Investors’ involvement to create a new era of gaming centered around blockchains and NFT marketplaces comes at a time filled with tension between multiplayer gaming communities and the centralization of the industry.  “Blockchain technology will unlock the potential for truly player-driven, open economies and will usher in the next wave of gaming and virtual worlds,” Faraway CEO Alex Paley said in the press release. “Our goal for both current and future games is to create extremely fun and social games with open economies, giving players true ownership over their in-game assets and a true voice in how the game evolves over time.”  A representative of Faraway told CoinDesk that Mini Royale is expected to be integrated with Solana’s blockchain in December.

CPR said that in the past few days there have been “multiple events” in which hundreds of crypto wallet users have had their funds stolen while trying to download and install well-known wallets like Metamask or change their currencies on crypto swap platforms such as PancakeSwap or Uniswap.  The scam campaigns used search engine advertisements to target crypto wallet users. They then employed fake URLs and websites to allow scammers to steal wallet passwords and access crypto funds held in wallets, said CPR.  The report gives an example of how an attacker uses a Google ad campaign to steal the user’s private key and access their MetaMask wallet by giving them a phrase that allows them to steal the funds upon transfer.

42394394,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcl1f,1636030200,Compounding and Saving in Bitcoin: The Power of a Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategy,"Frequently, I hear other advisors say, “I can’t buy bitcoin for clients; it’s too volatile and adds too much risk.” They’re also worried about purchasing power and inflation with savings rates at 0.50% or less. Bitcoin is an emerging asset class with a market cap of over $1 trillion. Bitcoin is often called a store of value, and its goal is to be better money. It achieves this by consensus rules and not allowing any single entity or group to change the monetary properties without the majority agreeing.  Before you question bitcoin’s store of value component, let’s look at the U.S. dollar. Consider that the dollar has lost 91% of its purchasing power since 1950, and the creation of dollars has accelerated dramatically since 2020. Now, let’s look at bitcoin as a savings tool and technology – particularly, through a strategy of dollar-cost averaging, the consistent purchasing of something over an extended period of time. You don’t go “all-in” in this strategy, but instead look to allocate an amount over a predetermined period of time. This period can have an end date or simply be until you decide to stop.  First, let’s say hypothetically that you had the worst luck with timing ever. You bought the absolute top of the first bitcoin cycle in 2011; if you held for 37 months, you did not lose money. (Rarely would I advocate for a large single lump-sum purchase hoping to find the “right” time to buy bitcoin.) If you understand scarcity and that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin, when it comes to trying to time the perfect buy, this popular Chinese proverb rings true: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the second-best time is now.”  Bitcoin as a savings tool  You will never be able to time the perfect entry in any initial purchase. The chart below shows the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of bitcoin over various periods while buying at different intervals. Again, if you had the world’s worst timing and started dollar-cost averaging monthly right into the 2017 price run-up from under $1,000 to a peak of $20,000, you would have still compounded at over 48%.  Bitcoin is a savings technology and a store of value when you save consistently. As advisors, we advocate that clients automate savings all the time when planning for goals and retirement. Now you’re using a better method to help them save. You don’t need to turn off all the savings they are doing in other assets. An option here, for example, is to carve off a portion for bitcoin and allow the adoption rate of bitcoin, which is rivaling that of the internet in 1997, and network effects of better money work in your client’s favor. Thinking about volatility? Dollar-cost averaging reduces that impact.  Future growth  Looking toward the future, you might question the likelihood of these CAGRs. Let’s remember that bitcoin is a $1 trillion asset with limited retail, institutional and nation-state adoption. Bitcoin investment firm NYDIG estimated in January of this year that 10% of Americans owned bitcoin. (There was no mention of the dollar amount owned, which would lead one to believe the percentage with serious capital allocated to bitcoin is significantly lower.)  Notably, based on data on rolling four-year CAGRs for bitcoin, the absolute worst time frame was from April 9, 2013, to April 9, 2017, with a CAGR of 52%. The best CAGR was an eye-popping 235%, for the period from June 18, 2012, to June 18, 2016. The ten-year CAGR for bitcoin is 146%, even with large 80%-90% drawdowns.  When looking at the adoption curve, it’s hard to argue we are not still in the early innings for bitcoin. Recently the first bitcoin futures ETF was just launched, and the Houston Firefighters Pension Fund became the first public pension plan in the U.S. to invest in digital assets. As adoption accelerates, I fully expect that CAGRs will start to compress and decline.  Let’s assume that the following ten-year CAGR will be the worst dollar-cost averaging CAGR we’ve seen, which is 48%. That’s a 67% reduction from the previous ten-year CAGR of 146% – which is not an unrealistic expectation. Why, you might ask? Bitcoin is a fixed-supply asset – the only way to reflect demand is through the price.  Today, there are six publicly traded bitcoin mining companies all holding bitcoin they mine –that’s the only way for new bitcoin to be created – and raising inexpensive debt to allow them not to sell to finance operations. Business-intelligence software company MicroStrategy holds over 114,000 bitcoin. El Salvador has adopted a bitcoin standard. All of these developments did not happen in the last ten years, and retail ownership and demand is continuing to increase. The CAGR of Bitcoin may reduce, but demand is increasing and supply of liquid Bitcoin for sale is decreasing. (One easy way to track liquid supply is via Glassnode.)  Bitcoin dollar-cost averaging: an example  Here’s a scenario: What would it look like for someone to take a 2.5% allocation in bitcoin with a hypothetical $500,000 portfolio, then dollar-cost average at $280 per month? What impact does this have on wealth over time, and is the risk worth the reward?  Under this scenario, you’d have the client save $33,600 over the next ten years, and that initial $12,500 investment would grow to be $2,181,625. Is that risking too much of the portfolio at 2.5%? Is $3,360 per year asking too much to save for someone with a $500,000 portfolio? You could likely fund the bitcoin dollar-cost averaging strategy with the income from that traditional portfolio. In my opinion, this is highly doable for most clients, and provides an outcome all of the clients I’ve talked with would embrace.  And what if you instead stick to what we’ve seen work – the S&P 500? If you did the same thing, you’d end up at the end of the decade with $136,654. (That’s at a CAGR of 15.30%, one of the highest over the last 100 years.) This begs the question of whether that’s sustainable – and that should be questioned, as the S&P 500 is arguably overvalued. (One could look at the price to earnings, price to sales, U.S. market value divided by GDP, or CAPE Ratio, for instance.) It’s hard outside of an interest rate model to find a valuation metric on which the U.S. stock market is not flashing red. The opportunity cost to not allocate to bitcoin looks massive when compared to the U.S. stock market.  Saving in bitcoin moving forward  Your clients are looking to you for answers, including how they can maintain purchasing power with market uncertainty. You understand the merits of diversification and its impacts on portfolio construction; think of how your clients are saving as well. Consider starting a dollar-cost averaging strategy for your clients.  As the data shows, you don’t need to be perfect in selecting when to start, or whether you choose daily, weekly or monthly. The act of saving in bitcoin changes the impact those funds can have over time. The result might be that clients have the option to retire sooner – based on your saving recommendations.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/04/compounding-and-saving-in-bitcoin-the-power-of-a-dollar-cost-averaging-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4adc0b786f85c3765fa7c656154486390628109-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421699,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXp9a9,1636030200,Why the Advisor Crypto Technology Gap Is Closing,"When I first became aware of cryptocurrencies a little more than a decade ago, no one I knew was investing in them.  That changed quickly as people around me began to buy, hold and trade crypto, using trading and custody tools that quickly became more sophisticated and kept changing on pace with technology in general.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  But when I first started writing for financial advisors in 2015, I witnessed a completely different picture – there were no mainstream tools for advisors to work with cryptocurrencies, and much of the technology that did exist looked like Flintstones appliances compared with the tools that traders and do-it-yourselfers were using.  A gap opens  When bitcoin was launched in 2009 and cryptocurrencies burst into the global financial consciousness, the individual, the do-it-yourself investor, gained a technological advantage over the average advisor, mostly from being a first mover.  Today, that gap between individual investor and advisor has almost closed as new tools and platforms are rolled out for financial planners, enabling them to advise clients on and work directly with cryptocurrencies. The traditional financial industry is finally catching up.  “Cryptocurrencies as an industry and asset class began with people going individually into tokens, but now there’s an asset management and advisor infrastructure being built,” said Henry Yoshida, co-founder and CEO of Rocket Dollar, which provides self-directed retirement accounts to individuals who want to use their retirement savings to invest in any alternative asset, including crypto. Yoshida is a former Merrill Lynch advisor who went on to found MY Group LLC, a retirement advisory firm with $2.6 billion in assets under management and then robo-advisor Honest Dollar, which was acquired by Goldman Sachs.  “Traditionally, regular people could only purchase mutual funds, and only advisors and an exclusive group of investors could buy stocks and bonds and other assets,” he said “It’s the exact opposite in crypto; it started with the people first, and only now are we getting the technology, regulations and infrastructures for advisors.”  Closing the gap  Dan Eyre, CEO of Blockchange, an asset management program and separately managed account (SMA) platform for digital assets, said that the technology to open advisor access to cryptocurrencies already existed in 2009, but few of the larger players in advisor technology and custody services took the asset class seriously.  “These tools should have been there all along, but until last year, a lot of the bigger players didn’t see a lot of legitimacy in the asset class and were kind of waiting, hoping for it to die out,” said Eyre. “By the time it really caught on, they were behind the curve, while the innovators were further ahead. It’s because this asset class is fundamentally new. It’s not repackaging something that already existed, it’s rebuilding it from the ground up.”  For one thing, Eyre said that traditional custody and access tools and infrastructure don’t work well for digital assets because digital assets are traded frequently and on a round-the-clock basis.  Blockchange is built on top of crypto exchange Gemini’s custody and infrastructure offerings. Through a recently announced partnership with Equity Trust, the company now offers access to Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS)-eligible individual retirement accounts, which reduces the waiting period to transfer assets into an IRA – an important consideration when investing in markets that move as fast as cryptocurrencies do. Gemini’s offering makes it possible for advisors to access and work within their clients’ cryptocurrency accounts.  Onramp Invest, another service offering similar side-by-side access for advisors and the end investor, launched in July.  Giving crypto a familiar face  Blockchange, for example, also gives advisors the ability to customize its client interface and offers or is pursuing integrations with major portfolio accounting platforms like Black Diamond Capital Management, Envestnet | Tamarac, Morningstar Office and Orion.  It’s the integrations, not new technology, that will open the world of cryptocurrencies to financial advisors, said Cory Klippsten, co-founder of Swan Bitcoin, which allows do-it-yourself investors to buy bitcoin through automatic deductions or in one step and which is planning to roll out a service for financial advisors this fall.  “It’s been hard for advisors to set themselves up to work with cryptocurrencies, but the ability has been there,” Klippsten said. “What they need is technology that integrates with the Black Diamonds, Addepars and Envestnets of the world, the different tools and reporting systems that the advisor industry already trusts and relies on. That will make bitcoin and other crypto look very similar to the other products they are already used to dealing with. It’s the key to opening up that market.”  It’s important for both advisors and clients to have technology platforms that look and behave like the technology they are already accustomed to, Klippsten said, and that allows advisors and financial firms to charge fees for providing advice on cryptocurrency.  What about ETFs?  Much has been said about the prospect for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S., with many advisors holding out hope that one will provide easy access to the cryptocurrency asset class without the need for new technology or custodial relationships.  Klippsten urged advisors not to confuse a spot bitcoin ETF with the recently launched bitcoin futures products.  “Futures ETFs don’t solve advisors’ problems; that’s for institutions to trade,” he said. “Every time the futures contract rolls over, you’re going to lose 5%-10%. You’ll end up with half as much in bitcoin as someone who buys the same amount of a spot ETF.”  Eyre pointed out that spot ETFs, like many of the already launched private products and trusts, are blunt instruments that give exposure to only one kind of token, or a fixed index of tokens, but cryptocurrency markets move very fast. SMA services like Blockchange offer a digital platform on which advisors and asset managers can build, manage and allocate to their own strategies or third-party models.  “It has taken too much time to get here, but I think we are now arriving at a point where the tools are finally there, they’re operational, they’re being used, and they’re creating value for clients,” Eyre said. “The days are numbered where advisors or managers can say we don’t have a plan or a strategy for digital assets.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/04/why-the-advisor-crypto-technology-gap-is-closing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e8bf00fe3e9c86867d1b038a30f0f2da331adb7-5061x3369.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Efinity Metaverse Fund will aim to support work on metaverse projects on Efinity – a blockchain developed by Enjin with Polkadot – as well as those involved in non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralized applications (dapp) and gaming, according to an announcement Thursday.  Enjin’s fund will focus on cross-chain NFT assets, digital collectible applications, gaming that harnesses mixed reality, virtual events and building multichain infrastructure.  The metaverse is a conceptualized world where the internet eventually becomes an immersive virtual space that can be used for work, play, socializing, experiences and events. The term was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel “Snow Crash.”  “These days, the metaverse is everywhere,” according to Enjin. “It is now time for us to turn this into an official, public and conscious piece of our growth strategy, and support a free, open and decentralized metaverse.”  Efinity was originally developed for Ethereum, and Enjin raised $18.9 million in a private token sale in March to fund its migration to Polkadot in order to escape Ethereum’s high gas prices and increase the ability to expand NFTs on the Efinity platform.

Brooks is replacing Valery Vavilov, who will stay on as Bitfury’s “chief vision officer,” according to an announcement Thursday.  “Mr. Brooks will lead the 10-year-old crypto unicorn as it launches a new funding round, increases the growth of its mining business with a revolutionary new microchip design and new global data center locations,” Bitfury announced.  The appointment comes weeks after news that Bitfury was planning to go public in the next 12 months in what would be Europe’s biggest cryptocurrency valuation.  The Amsterdam-based firm is thought to be valued at $1 billion.  After just four months with Binance US, Brooks resigned in August citing “differences over strategic direction” between him and his colleagues.  His appointment had been seen as a sign that the infamously opaque Binance was seeking an image of greater transparency through hiring well-regarded regulators to senior roles.  Brooks had previously served as the acting controller of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the regulator for U.S. national banks, between May 2020 and January 2021.

In September, Spain’s La Liga became the first of Europe’s top soccer leagues to offer NFTs of all its players through French digital soccer collectibles platform Sorare. European rivals including Atletico Madrid, Porto, AS Roma and England’s Liverpool have already announced NFT deals.

The Mike Novogratz-led asset manager reported the preliminary AUM figure on Wednesday.  Compared to the equivalent figure in 2020, the firm’s AUM has grown over 600% from $446.3 million at the end of October 2020.  October’s performance can largely be attributed to Galaxy’s roster of Canadian ETFs, particularly its Toronto Stock Exchange-listed CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF (ETHX), the company’s global asset management head Steve Kurz said in an interview with Bloomberg.  ETHX, which invests directly in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, saw its price grow by over 28% in October, tracking a surge in the underlying asset’s value of over 40%.  “From a market infrastructure and development of the asset class perspective, ether is picking up steam, probably the way bitcoin did a year and a half ago,” Kurz said.

The Streamr Network, which is not a blockchain, had in total 130,000 nodes joining throughout its testnet phase that ran over the course of the past two months. At its peak, the third Testnet had 90,000 node runners simultaneously participating from 85 different countries. This made the Streamr Testnet one of the biggest P2P networks in computing history. So what is the Streamr Network? Streamr is a decentralized network for real-time data transport. Real-time data services are needed when you receive a notification on your phone, or when someone sends a tweet. If we look at the existing web 3 stack, we have blockchains for security, financial transactions and identity management, then there are data storage solutions like IPFS or Skynet, but these components alone do not make the decentralized web as instantaneous as the centralized web. An NFT stored on IPFS will take several seconds to load, but web 2 operates at the speed of milliseconds. That&apos;s where the Streamr Network becomes an important component of the web 3 stack. During the Streamr Testnets, node runners were able to broadcast messages to every other node in the network in about 350 milliseconds on average. What do we need these fast broadcasting services for?
