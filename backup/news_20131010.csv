42376616,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTb9,1381439561,Dwolla shuts doors to bitcoin companies and virtual currency exchanges,"Dwolla has announced it can no longer work with virtual currency exchanges and other bitcoin-related services.  The online payment system provider emailed its customers who operate companies related to bitcoin and other virtual currencies to inform them it is withdrawing its services as of 28th October at 16:00 CT.  Dwolla's reasons for doing so aren't exactly clear, with the email stating:    ""Recent interest involving virtual currency and its exchanges has created uncertainty and confusion around virtual currency, and Dwolla's relationship with a small number of its exchanges. This has forced Dwolla to reassign resources, funds, and services.      As Dwolla gears up for a new stage of growth, we recognize that we can no longer sustain this merchant base (0.1 percent of Dwolla merchants) and its unique needs, and that attempting to do so jeopardizes both of our communities' starkly different, but similarly ambitious, vision for improving payments.""    The company is to gradually wind down the services available to its virtual currency customers over the two-and-a-half weeks before cutting them off completely. From today, for example, only existing Dwolla users will be able to send funds to the businesses in question, while on 15th October, those bitcoin businesses will no longer be able to receive money through Dwolla and will only be able to send it - until 28th October, when these business accounts will be fully suspended.  As ever, Reddit forum members have differing views on the development, with user 'trifith' stating that it was ""going to happen sooner or later"".  ""The point of exchange between Fiat and BTC is the single weakest point in the bitcoin ecosystem. We shall see what comes of this,"" (s)he added.  While 'ths1977' said:  ""The U.S. government is really cracking down hard on bitcoin lately, I won't be surprised to see coinbase go next. I have a sneaky feeling though that this is all just a ramp up to cleaning bitcoin up so that 'they' can get their stinky hands all over it.""  The full email from Dwolla to its virtual currency customers can be found here.  This move comes shortly after Capital One closed the bank account of a company after it started selling purely commemorative silver and copper bitcoin coins. According to Mulligan Mint's CEO Rob Gray, the bank hadn't bothered to do their research properly, as merchant services said the account was cancelled because the company was selling bitcoin.  What do you make of the news? Are banks and payment system providers running scared due to government interference?",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | RESEARCH,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/10/dwolla-shuts-doors-to-bitcoin-companies-and-virtual-currency-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7738323a0c72f36a94e06089d971968866dcc7a9-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376635,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTsl,1381415110,In-person bitcoin exchanges spread across the globe,"“I’ll do Coinbase price.”.      “It’s $10 under Gox.”      “Last time I was here everyone was trading in Gox price.”      “That was a long time ago.”      So went the banter on the trading floor -- or rather, the trading winding pathway in San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Gardens, where five men stood in a loose circle and prepared to trade bitcoins for dollars.      What qualifies as “a long time ago” in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency could only have been a few weeks earlier, at most. On this late-summer evening, the weekly cryptocurrency trading session known as Buttonwood had been convening for about two months.      It was named for the agreement that led to the birth of the New York Stock Exchange. But the resemblance ends there. The pace at Buttonwood was just a tad slower than on the NYSE trading floor, and there was no opening bell rung by a celebrity -- only the jingling collar of the occasional dog being walked by.      As the summer twilight fell on the grassy park and couples on dates strolled toward the movie theater in the nearby Metreon shopping center, one of the traders asked: “Buying or selling?”      Some traders responded that they didn’t care which. As the evening went on and more traders arrived, a little bit of both happened.      But for most of the traders, the main point was just to be there, participating in bitcoin.      San Francisco bitcoin consultant John Light started the Buttonwood exchange on 4th July, after seeing Josh Rossi start a similar event in May in New York City’s Union Square Park. Rossi first wrote about the idea of in-person exchanges, calling it Project Buttonwood, but ended up calling the actual meet-up Satoshi Square.      Now there are at least 11 exchanges meeting all over the world, in Berlin, Los Angeles, Tel Aviv, Sydney and more cities. Like traditional stock exchanges, the events work on the open outcry system -- traders verbally agree on exchange prices and execute the transactions using their smartphones or laptop computers, and cash.      Last week, Rossi held an exchange in Panama City, where he recently moved to work for a new bitcoin venture. He said he has helped a number of the other exchanges get going as well.      In NYC, Satoshi Square has drawn as many as 60 people, and on several occasions more than $10,000 in bitcoins have been bought or sold, Rossi said.      Sometimes the New York traders use a smartphone app that Rossi developed to keep track of buying and selling prices. In San Francisco, on the other hand, no more than $250 to $300 generally changes hands, and the volume hasn’t been high enough to bother with the app yet, Light said.      In Berlin, the exchange is called Bitcoin Exchange Berlin, has a sponsor (LocalBitcoins.com) and a logo, and even cute bowler hats for traders to wear and chalkboards where they can write their buying and selling bids. The BXB, as it’s called for short, also incorporates a marketplace where people can sell goods for bitcoins.      Before the exchanges popped up, if you wanted to trade bitcoins in person you pretty much had to use LocalBitcoins, a Helskinki-based website that helps individuals connect for one-on-one trades, much like a Craigslist for bitcoins.      Alan Lin, of Oakland, said he preferred meeting at San Francisco’s Buttonwood to LocalBitcoins match-ups.      “Half of the guys would come and half would postpone,” Lin said. If the price of bitcoins changed between the agreement and the meeting time, the trader might just decide not to show up, he said.      Light said one of the reasons he started Buttonwood was that he, too, had trouble trading on LocalBitcoins.      “I would try to get a time out of [the potential trader] or some contact info, and would either just not get responses or just delay after delay,” Light said.      Once you have half a dozen or more bitcoin enthusiasts gathered in one place, the friction is removed and trading can ensue seamlessly. So seamlessly, in fact, that all the trading was wrapped up within half an hour or so, leaving plenty of time for socializing and for teaching newbies about the currency. That’s part of the point, Light said.      “Some people specifically show up to learn and it’s a kind of environment where they can see how bitcoin works in person,” Light said.      Since the same traders tend to show up repeatedly and there are plenty of witnesses around, it’s also a safer way to trade. With a one-on-one meetup, traders say, they might show their dollars, but only hand them over once the bitcoin transfer goes through. In Yerba Buena Gardens, people hand over $20 bills first, then transfer the bitcoins.      The traders gathered at Yerba Buena looked like a pretty clean-cut group, and many said they dislike publicity portraying bitcoins as the currency of crime.      Buying bitcoins in person is indeed more anonymous than going through an online trading service like Coinbase or Tradehill, an anonymity that would be useful if you’re planning to use it for something illegal. But Light said no one has shown up at Buttonwood broadcasting that they’re looking for drug money.      “I think people understand that they would probably get turned away, or that would cause a bit of awkwardness. Anybody who’s done that has probably kept it to themselves,” Light said.      The traders at Buttonwood said that the appeal of trading in person is more about privacy than trying to get away with something.      “I prefer to give companies as little of my personal information as possible,” Light said.      Then there’s the sense that trading person to person is in keeping with the idea of bitcoin as a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency.      “To me it makes sense to have a distributed model, that is not dependent on companies in far-away lands, their regulatory environment, and their technological skill,” Rossi said. “Bitcoin has proven to be an incredibly resilient network, I think the methods by which we convert it to and from traditional fiat should be as resilient.”      With Tradehill’s bitcoin trading on hold due to regulatory issues, and US customers having trouble getting their money out of Mt. Gox, it makes sense for bitcoin users to build up these in-person events as a way to keep bitcoins trading if the newly launched corporate intermediaries are not longer around.      Speaking of regulators, are these casual exchanges legal? FinCEN, the US financial crimes enforcement network, did not respond to comment requests, and a recording on the office’s press line said the office is temporarily unavailable, probably due to the US government shutdown.      The virtual currency guidance that FinCEN issued in March says that people engaged in the exchange of virtual currency as a business are considered money services businesses, and as such are subject to registration, reporting and record-keeping regulations. However, people who simply acquire a virtual currency for their own use are not subject to these regulations.      In the end, passing a beautiful evening in the park, trading dollars for bitcoins doesn’t seem like such a fringe activity. In fact, to at least one participant, this group leans toward the mainstream.      “I still have some Ripples and PrimeCoins if anyone’s interested,” said Cole Albon, a San Francisco data warehouse engineer. He explained that PrimeCoin is a newer cryptocurrency that discovers prime numbers as its proof of work. But even Albon is unsure if PrimeCoin will pan out, and he was not too surprised that no one was buying.      “They’re way too exotic for this crew,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/10/in-person-bitcoin-exchanges-spread-across-the-globe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aedf2568c4880fc4a8853325f597237f930d7723-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376628,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTlD,1381408522,Capital One closes company's bank account over mere mention of bitcoin,"Capital One has closed a bank account belonging to a company that produces metal medallions after it started selling commemorative silver and copper bitcoin coins.  Rob Gray, CEO of Mulligan Mint, Inc said Capital One gave him no warning before it closed his company's bank account. He has since contacted the bank, but isn't satisfied with its response.  ""Nobody seems to know who makes decisions there, the local branch gave us nothing, merchant services told us our account was cancelled for selling bitcoin and they were not interested in discussing the issue further,"" Gray said.  Mulligan Mint does not accept bitcoin as payment for any of its products, the only connection with the digital currency is that it sells two types of bitcoin medallion. Both feature the bitcoin currency symbol on one side, set on a background of a computer circuit board.  The silver version features the message “Commodity banks and crypto currencies will render central banks desolate - Free the currency, free the people” plus an operational QR code. When the code is scanned by a smartphone, it directs the user to Mulligan Mint's online store.  The copper medallion displays words that describe the currency’s key features: digital, decentralized and peer-to-peer.  Regulatory assault  Gray said US banks all seem to have a policy of not allowing their customers to facilitate transactions that include the buying and selling of bitcoin, and labelled it a ""massive US regulatory assault on cryptocurrency"".  He went on to say the person ""watchdogging"" for Capital One must not have read the product pages about the Mulligan Mint Bitcoin Coins as, if they had, they would realise they are merely a type of bitcoin merchandise and the company doesn't actually deal in digital currency. Gray added:  ""We don’t know if it's incompetence or has been orchestrated to scare US companies away from anything associated with bitcoin.""  CoinDesk contacted Capital One, but they had not replied by the time of publication.  Mulligan Mint is currently searching for another merchant processor and, in the meantime, is using PayPal. Gray believes banks in the US will do everything they can to prevent bitcoin from growing, but he thinks digital currency will triumph, and then the banks will look for ways to control and profit from it.  With other countries talking a more relaxed approach to bitcoin, for example Germany, Gray said: ""The real question is this – will the US banks join the rest of the world in time or be left out of the cryptocurrency party?""  Other banking troubles  Mulligan Mint is not alone in the banking problems it has been facing. In August, bitcoin exchange platform Tradehill suspended trading due to “operational and regulatory issues” faced by its bank – the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union (IAFCU).  Kinnard Hockenhull  , founder and CEO of BitBox, said his company's account with IAFCU was also closed.  ""I do think they truly believe in bitcoin, but everyone's afraid of the regulators,"" he said, adding:  ""Being a money transmitter at the federal level does not necessarily make you a money transmitter at the state level, but many financial institutions are simply turning away companies without licenses.""  He went on to say BitBox is currently working with another banking partner, but would not name it as he said it was IAFCU's place in the spotlight as a bitcoin supporter that seemed to cause it problems.  On the brighter side, just this week, Kraken announced it had partnered with Fidor Bank to offer bitcoin trading services to its customers in the EU. This shows that there are some financial institutions and even regulators out there that are willing to take a chance on bitcoin.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/10/capital-one-closes-companys-bank-account-over-mere-mention-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c94729a558b1235c15875c9af89a95b508e763db-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376615,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6bTXN,1381397592,Bitcoin seller btcQuick hits nearly $2 Million in sales,"Bitcoin sales service btcQuick says that it has achieved nearly $2m in sales.  Colorado-based CEO Jerrod Bunce started the company in November 2012, after trying to buy bitcoins and getting frustrated with bitcoin sales site BitInstant, a service that enabled customers to buy and sell bitcoin but which was criticized for its slow service.  “I thought to myself ‘I can build this to be better’,” he said. He then coded the site in PHP, using the Twitter Bootstrap front end.  When users request to purchase bitcoins using US dollars, btcQuick buys the equivalent amount in bitcoins from an exchange, which it then sends to the customer's bitcoin address, or to their email address using Inputs.io.  The firm started slowly, growing with the help of $120,000 in funding from private investors and crowdfunding, says Bunce. It has grown substantially over the last few months, according to Bunce, who showed CoinDesk proof of his monthly sales figures. The firm is currently doing a little over $500,000 in business, he said.  BtcQuick’s model is to be among the fastest to provide bitcoins, if not necessarily the cheapest. It charges a 7.5% fee on transactions, but this can slide to as little as 3% given enough volume. Transactions made by credit card are settled in a couple of hours.  Most of its sales (70.5%) are from the US, said Bunce, who added that the company is also selling to users in countries including Canada, Australia, Argentina, China, Germany and the UK. On average, a single transaction is $175. Bunce said:  “We have mainly been spread around by word of mouth, but have recently started advertising on reddit, dailybitcoins and via Google CPC ads.”  Customers are expected to go through verification procedures by proving their identity, says the firm, which then allows them to purchase bitcoins using a credit or debit card. “I expect this to change as we work towards FinCen compliance,” he concluded.  The company doesn’t yet have compliance, but is working with US lawyer Marco Santori (the Bitcoin Foundation's regulatory affairs committee chair) on this issue.  In the meantime, Bunce is contemplating pulling out of three US states – New York, California, and Texas – until the issue is resolved.  “California and New York don’t hold a large percentage of our business,” he says. Those two states have both hit bitcoin-related organisations with subpoenas or warning notices in the past few months.  In the meantime, btcQuick is doing its best to follow KYC rules and stop fraud on its network. It has a deal with miiCard, under which it uses the site’s identification hardware to verify customer identities. It gives customers who use Miicard a 1% discount from the original fee as part of a silver membership  The company also uses a fraud detection system from Signifyd, which Bunce says offers the firm greater assurance that malicious actors are not trying to game its network.  The site that inspired Bunce, BitInstant, which was operated by New York-based Charlie Shrem, shut down on 13th July to work on a service upgrade. The site, which would have been a competitor to btcQuick, has still not reopened. It was subsequently hit with a class-action lawsuit by angry customers.  Have you used btcQuick?
