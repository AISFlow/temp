42381752,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p1oJ,1554321613,SEC's First Crypto 'No-Action' Letter Took 11 Months to Secure,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cleared TurnKey Jet, Inc to raise money via the sale of a custom cryptocurrency on Wednesday in the form of a ""no-action"" letter, it's first to address blockchain-based fundraising.  The letter  means the Florida-based startup can sell TKJ tokens to customers with the sole purpose of helping them book travel on private jets. James Prescott Curry is the lawyer who worked with TurnKey Jet to get the SEC's assurance that it won't take regulatory action against the startup.  In announcing its decision April 3, the SEC references a letter from Curry dated April 2. However, as Curry explained to CoinDesk today, yesterday's letter was probably the 10th version he'd written.  He told CoinDesk:  ""I submitted the first draft of the letter on May 23, 2018, so it was a long, but rewarding, process.""  In addition to multiple versions of the letter, Curry estimated he probably took as many as 50 phone calls with SEC agency staff, largely beginning in the fall of last year. Four or five of those calls lasted from an hour to 90 minutes, Curry said, as SEC staff offered detailed questions regarding TurnKey's proposal.  The longer calls are referred to by staff as ""comment calls."" The first one began the iterative process between TurnKey and the SEC in October, Curry said.  Over the course of the discussions, the letter shrank from more than 20 pages to its current 13-page iteration. Despite all the contact, Curry said, the company was not sure it would attain relief until the SEC's letter came out this morning.  ""They're good poker players,"" he said.  We spoke to Curry, who serves on two technology committees of the Florida Bar Association, in detail about how he was able to shepherd TurnKey through to this phase of its business model.  First step: Call Washington  The SEC would like entrepreneurs to begin by contacting its staff, and that's what TurnKey did.  ""TurnKey Jet is highly regulated,"" Curry began. It interacts with multiple transportation and public safety agencies, which made the company very hesitant about entering the controversial realm of initial coin offerings (ICOs).  ""We decided rather than put any money into doing anything, we start with the SEC,"" he continued. ""We honestly thought it was a total long shot.""  While a positive step forward, it's worth noting that a letter like this is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.  A source familiar with the process inside the SEC told CoinDesk:  ""The no-action letter sets forth the conditions that the issuer would abide by in order to secure that no-action relief. It doesn’t bind the Commission, but it’s a pretty strong letter to have.""  Why a token, anyway?  Banking hours create a problem for the charter jet industry.  ""Rich guys have wire money ready to go, but they are subject to banking hours,"" Curry explained. ""It's a spur-of-the-moment thing.""  If there's no money paid, they don't go, Curry explained. And traditional financial rails can take too long.  A token allows TurnKey to pre-pay or to buy tokens from other members on the eventual network, potentially even exchanging value with cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, if that works better at the last minute. The limitations presented by traditional banking moved the company to look for another option via the SEC.  Curry said that very little changed from the first letter to now, in terms of the facts. But he did mention one noteworthy adjustment: When TurnKey first submitted a request for relief, it mentioned ethereum as a potential blockchain for running its token. The final letter is agnostic in terms of which blockchain technology it will use.  TurnKey will begin investigating options ""post-haste,"" Curry said, noting that building its own solution is completely off the table.  ""We're not going to invent our own from scratch,"" he said. He mentioned solutions form Microsoft, IBM and others, while not ruling out public blockchains.  ""The tokens will be standards compliant,"" Curry said. ""It's not going to be any unique kind of token.""  SEC's wheelhouse  TurnKey presented the kind of fact set that the SEC was looking for to render a no-action letter, Curry said, adding:  ""We have good facts. That's exactly what they said on one of the calls. It's very easy to pass the Howey Test and be a security. Our model fails the Howey Test and is not a security.""  Curry discussed the benefits of a blockchain to the business in detail on the second page of his latest letter, but he also drew attention to Pages 10 and 11 of the SEC's new distributed ledger guidance document, which describes an online retailer offering crypto-based store credit.  ""That's what we are,"" he said. ""We're really the first example of that paragraph.""

42381762,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p1zd,1554311131,This New Lightning App Aims to Make Getting Paid in Bitcoin Easier,"A new app today has launched that aims to tackle the problem of ""inbound capacity"" on bitcoin's lightning network.  One of the challenges facing the still-in-development payment network centers around the need to have sufficient funds on the opposite end of their lightning channel, known as inbound capacity. Put more simply, users need to undertake several steps before they can actually receive money – a complicating factor for users such as merchants that want to accept funds via the network. It's also a quandary that some participants in the global ""lightning torch"" experiment have run up against.  The new Lightning Power Users app, released by developer Pierre Rochard, will join other services that are seeking to make it easier for users to get inbound capacity. That includes Bitrefill's Thor and the recently-launched Lightning Loop from Lightning Labs.  Lightning Power Users takes a slightly different approach than Thor, with a shorter limit to how long the service will keep a channel open if it isn't used. This is for users who might just want to accept a payment ""imminently"" and want a short-lived channel for a smaller fee, according to Rochard.  Rochard, known for developing a “node launcher” to make the lightning setup process easier, also launched the service because he worries about any one of these services growing too large and effectively making bitcoin more centralized than it needs to be.  As he put it in conversation with CoinDesk:  ""I think what I want to see is a large variety of ways to do this. If we rely on just LNBIG or other services, then bitcoin's not as decentralized. So, that's my goal. To provide a reliable service.  At first, he said, people were submitting via Google Form that he would use to manually set up a channel. But the new service automates the process.  As such, some users have tried Lightning Power Users already in a sort of undercover trial run leading up to the launch, with some saying they're happy with the service it provides and that the fee for use is ""reasonable.""  Rochard added:  ""It's one of the more legitimate criticisms of lightning. We'll see where it goes. there's healthy debate among developerss about how to solve this issue.""  Still, he thinks that in the long-run, developers might figure out a way to completely hide the inbound capacity step in some way. One approach would perhaps involve iterations on lightning's autopilot feature, or using newer computer science techniques such as machine learning.  Rochard argues that a new incoming lightning feature called dual-funded channels could also help, which were recently added to the specifications that all lightning implementations plan to enforce.  Until then, Rochard plans to use funds from Lightning Power Users to continue supporting his lightning node launcher.

42381760,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9p1yN,1554307161,Over 40 Central Banks Are Considering Blockchain Applications: Davos Report,"More than 40 central banks worldwide are experimenting with blockchain technology, says a new report by the World Economic Forum.  Published Wednesday  , the report analyzes how different central banks are either examining what blockchain can be used for or are outright experimenting with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).  ""It's very much the case that several central banks are looking at this,"" said Ashley Lannquist, a project lead in blockchain and distributed ledger technology at the World Economic Forum and the primary author of the report.  She counted at least 44 different central banks that are exploring, researching or actively experimenting with blockchain technology, with an eye to potentially issue a digital currency in the eventual future.  ""Pilot and experimentation work thus far on this subject has yielded some mixed results, some optimistic results, and the summary of where we are right now is that central banks are proceeding with caution, yet highly involved in research,"" Lannquist told CoinDesk.  At present, these banks have to navigate a host of technical and policy issues, she said. On the technical side, the institutions need to ensure that their new systems work as intended and whether they are preserving data privacy accurately.  Other questions pertain to the policy aspects, including a central bank's monetary policy. These issues need to be studied to avoid any unintended consequences, Lannquist said.  Those caveats aside, present trends bode well for CBDCs, she said:  ""I'd say in the next couple years, speculating towards the future and being a bit conservative, I would expect a couple central banks to issue a central bank digital currency and that's because we know that at least a few are.""  The National Bank of Cambodia, for example, plans to incorporate blockchain technology for its national payments system by the end of this year.  As Lannquist's report notes, the bank is looking to tackle two issues: many of the nation's residents are underbanked or unbanked entirely, and the banking system itself is not very efficient.  ""They currently have a very fragmented domestic payment system and many [residents] are unbanked,"" she said. ""Instead of using the bank they use private payment apps that don't even use the bank so they sometimes can't pay each other.""  The new blockchain-based payments system may serve to unite some of these disparate payment apps, providing more efficient payment and settlement services to Cambodia's residents, Lannquist said.  What's perhaps most surprising about Cambodia's plans is the fact that the bank is not going to start with a pilot program, but rather a large-scale deployment with over 10 banks.  ""They're jumping right into it,"" Lannquist said.  Communication  Not a lot of central banks were aware of Cambodia's work, Lannquist said. The purpose of the white paper was to share this information – as well as what efforts other central banks are working on.  Another example came from France.  ""The Bank of France has actually been using ethereum with smart contracts [and] a private ethereum implementation,"" Lannquist said. ""It's one of the first production deployments of ethereum in the world and it was by a central bank.""  The bank has replaced its process for provisioning and sharing Single Euro Payments Area Credit Identifiers (SCIs) with the blockchain-based system, which has been operational since the end of 2017.  Much of the WEF's efforts in the crypto space have centered around facilitating communications among central banks, Lannquist added. Many of these institutions have been quietly researching the space for three or four years, with ""a surge in 2016.""  ""We've been trying to help those that are new catch up,"" she said, by connecting central banks new to the field to those that have already been researching blockchain use cases.  Best known for its annual conference in Davos, Switzerland, WEF also introduces many of these banks to experts in the crypto space, as another aid to the spirit of collaboration, she said.  ""We're connecting the blockchain technical community to the central banks to help them. I host webinars and in-person meetings periodically so we connect these experts to the banks,"" Lannquist said. ""We bring in academics as well. It's shown to be quite valuable to central banks thus far and will hopefully [continue to be helpful].""  Wednesday's paper was produced in part thanks to this collaborative effort.  Next steps  Still, at least for now central banks are quietly looking into blockchain tools. Lannquist said she expects to see continued progress in the coming months, but more importantly, she hopes that ""some conclusions [are] being drawn.""  Specifically, she hopes each of the central banks looking into distributed ledger technology will conclude whether it finds the technology useful or not, and why these banks reach whichever conclusion they do.  ""The faster we can get to those conclusions, the better in terms of getting that research,"" she said.  Asked whether she expects to see banks implement CBDCs, Lannquist said, ""I don't know, I don't expect it to be widespread and that's because most central banks don't have a strong need and that's because they already have an efficient system.""  One area that will probably benefit from DLT-based systems, including central bank digital currencies specifically, are emerging markets – like Cambodia. At present, domestic interbank payments and settlements in many developing economies are inefficient, Lannquist explained.  ""This is where the commercial banks are sending transactions to each other but they have to go through a central bank, another place where they can be more efficient,"" she said, adding:  ""[DLT payment systems] would support the economy and support them, and then finally related to retail central bank digital currencies, many countries have quite segmented payment systems and having a unified, even if domestic or even better cross-border [remittance system] could decrease the cost of digital payments.""  CBDCs that are a digitized form of a fiat may also be easier for residents to use, which would aid the central banks issuing currencies, Lannquist said.  ""They could be able to send payments [cross-border] in their fiat currency than the dollar more easily,"" she said.

42381733,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oxqz,1554303430,SEC Issues First 'No-Action' Letter Clearing ICO to Sell Tokens in US,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a ""no-action"" letter to TurnKey Jet, Inc., agreeing that tokens used by the business-travel startup are not securities. The regulatory stamp of approval is contingent upon the company using its tokens under certain conditions.  Those conditions include:  Token-generated funds cannot be used to develop the company's platform technology (such as its app).  The tokens will be immediately useful.  The TKJ tokens will remain at a fixed price of one U.S. dollar.  The tokens can only be used for air charter services.  Repurchases will only be made at a discount to the token.  TurnKey Jet will not represent the tokens as having profit potential.  TurnKey Jet is an air charter and air taxi service based in the United States, operating from West Palm Beach, Florida, since 2012.  The letter, dated April 3, comes in reply to a letter from James P. Curry, counsel for TurnKey Jet, dated April 2. 2019. The letter was signed by Jonathan A. Ingram of the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance.  Perhaps the most interesting provision requires that the tokens not be transferable. The SEC's letter says, ""TKJ will restrict transfers of Tokens to TKJ Wallets only, and not to wallets external to the Platform.""  A person familiar with the news told CoinDesk, ""Many in the industry have asked how the commission might give some relief in a case where folks are trying to bring this technology into a real-life use case, and the no-action letter simply says the division will not recommend an enforcement action.""  Experts weigh in  ""It is a huge step forward for the industry to have a no-action letter published,"" cryptocurrency and finance attorney Joshua Ashley Klayman of Klayman LLC told CoinDesk. ""It is the sort of guidance that the market needs and has been looking for.""  That the SEC's letter relies upon the opinion of TurnKey's counsel is also notable, Klayman pointed out.  Other legal experts in the space saw it to be less noteworthy, however, considering many of the outlined restrictions.  ""The issue most coin offerings undertaken to date will face is that they possess many elements common to products that, in the past, courts have found to be security-like,"" Preston Byrne, a lawyer at Byrne & Storm, P.C., told CoinDesk. ""Although the no-action letter is a new development, I don't see it creating a viable issuance pathway within the United States for the crypto-token products most enterprises are hoping to build.""  As CoinDesk has previously reported, attorneys have been waiting on requested no-action letters for some time. In December, the SEC's ""crypto czar,"" Valerie Szczepanik, discussed the agency's ongoing negotiations with crypto startups around token sales.  Sczczepanik has been urging companies to interact directly with the agency, suggesting better outcomes will occur if they do.  “We’d much rather have people come and ask us before they do something rather than coming and asking for forgiveness,” she said last month at SXSW.  With one project's plan greenlit, this letter may be held out as a case in point.  Private jets  TurnKey Jet is a Florida company, domiciled in Delaware, that has been in operation since 2012, according to Curry's letter. The company describes a number of inefficiencies in its industry that it believes smart contracts can help solve.  TurnKey's letter goes into some detail about the token's use:  ""Redeemable for air charter services, the proposed Tokens in operation will be like the business jet card programs that are common in the aviation industry today.""  TurnKey further asserts that these tokens will not obligate the company to provide service at any cost; rather, one TKJ will represent one USD worth of fees.  All outstanding tokens will be fully backed by an equal amount of fiat in an FDIC-insured institution, the company writes.  The TurnKey letter notes that only the company will be able to generate tokens and that the sale will be on an ongoing basis. Tokens will be nonrefundable and destroyed as users spend them – and escrowed USD will be remitted to the company or its business partners.  While the SEC's letter forbid the tokens from leaving wallets controlled by TurnKey Jet, it did not object to this statement within its letter to the agency: ""When a Token enters circulation, TKJ Consumers may freely trade or exchange the Tokens in their possession between any other Consumer, Broker or Carrier within the Network.""  Separately on Wednesday, the SEC released long-awaited regulatory guidance for token sellers (read more here).  This is a developing story and CoinDesk will update as needed.

42381735,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oxxH,1554302472,The SEC Just Released Its Long-Awaited Crypto Token Guidance,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has published fresh regulatory guidance for token issuers, nearly half a year in the making.  The guidance focuses on tokens and outlines how and when these cryptocurrencies may fall under a securities classification, according to the document.  SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman first revealed that the regulator was developing new guidance for crypto tokens last November, and other members of the agency, including FinHub head Valerie Szczepanik and Commissioner Hester Peirce, have repeatedly said that SEC staff was working on the document.  In November, Hinman said the ""plain English"" guidance would help token issuers easily determine whether or not their cryptocurrency would qualify as a security offering.  The guidance includes examples of both networks and tokens that fall under securities laws, as well as a project which does not.  DLT framework  The framework itself outlines a number of factors that token issuers must consider before evaluating whether or not their offerings qualify as securities. These factors include an expectation of profit, whether a single or at least central group of entities are responsible for specific tasks within the network, and whether a group is creating or supporting a market for a digital asset.  Referencing the oft-cited Howey test, the guidance highlights ""reliance on the efforts of others,"" reasonable expectation of profits, how developed the network is, what the tokens' use cases might be, whether there is a correlation between a token's purchase price and its market price and a host of other factors.  The guidance also details how issuers should look at tokens previously sold, both in evaluating whether they should have been registered as securities, as well as whether ""a digital asset previously sold as a security should be reevaluated.""  The criteria for this reevaluation include whether:  The ""distributed ledger network and digital asset are fully developed and operational"" (meaning individuals can immediately use the token for some function);  The token is focused on a specific use case rather then speculation;  ""Prospects for appreciation"" in the token's value are limited; and  If billed as a currency, the token actually operates as a store of value.  While this guidance has been a long time coming, and provides some legal clarity for token issuers, it is not a legally binding document, and should be seen more as a guideline.  Peirce has said in the past that staff-issued guidance does not carry the weight that guidance issued by the Commissioners would.  Speaking at New York University in March, Peirce explained  :  ""Now staff guidance is staff guidance. The Commission can go ahead and bring enforcement actions anyway but staff guidance does carry a bit of weight, but I would like to do something more formal at the Commission level so people have a little bit more certainty.""  Remaining questions  While the guidance discusses securities classifications, other questions remain unanswered. In particular, the SEC has yet to provide clarity around the idea of custody for broker-dealers holding cryptocurrencies.  The key issue around custody comes from the fact that while broker-dealers can easily verify that cryptocurrencies in any given wallet belong to them, it is harder to prove that no one else has access to the holdings.  Szczepanik said during a panel at the D.C. Blockchain Summit in March that these firms ""need to show that they have possession and control and that could be hard to demonstrate with a digital asset.""  ""A digital asset ... is controlled by whoever possesses the private key, and it's hard to prove a negative,"" she explained.  Also Wednesday, the SEC issued its first-ever no-action letter authorizing a startup's token sale to go forward (full story here).

42381745,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oy4p,1554300919,Atomic Capital Makes Crypto's Most Aggressive Lending Offer Yet,"Atomic Capital, an asset tokenization startup founded last year, is entering the crypto-backed lending field, with a seemingly aggressive loan offer.  Announced Wednesday, the New York-based company will provide U.S. dollar loans for up to 85 percent of the value of the bitcoin or ether pledged as collateral, which appears to be the most generous loan-to-value (LTV) rate available on the market.  To put that figure in perspective, BlockFi offers crypto-backed loans with a maximum LTV of 50 percent, which means you can only borrow half of what your crypto is worth.  Another crypto lender, Celsius Network, gives customers options of 25, 33 or 50 percent LTV, with the interest rates rising accordingly. SALT Lending, meanwhile, offers loans with LTVs from 30 to 70 percent.  A higher LTV ratio means the lender has less protection against a sudden fall in the value of the collateral. But to compensate for the additional risk, Atomic will charge interest rates of 11 percent to 13 percent, considerably higher than the 4.5 percent to 8.95 percent rates charged by competitors.  The firm says it will arrange these loans in amounts ranging from $100,000 all the way up to $100 million, starting on April 9. While the high end of that range may sound farfetched, Atomic CEO Alexander Blum claims the firm already has requests for $80 million worth of loans.  Blum said that his startup's experienced team, which includes former employees of Deloitte, PwC and other well-known companies, believes an 85 percent LTV product is viable and will be competitive in the current environment. “We’re very confident we can succeed,” he told CoinDesk.  Brokering loans  Atomic Capital raised $3.4 million in a security token offering (STO) in October, and $250,000 from Baroda Capital as a seed investment. However, these funds won't be used to make the loans.  Indeed, Atomic won't be funding the loans itself, but rather brokering them for Lockwood Group, a Luxembourg-based investment firm that will assume the risk and take custody of the borrowers' crypto collateral.  ""We will be a trusted third party that is regulated in the U.S.,"" Blum told CoinDesk, explaining that Atomic Capital will provide the technological side of the product.  As for the nature of that regulation, Blum said Atomic Capital's ""team of FINRA-licensed representatives operate under a broker-dealer,"" LoHi Securities in Denver.  Reached by CoinDesk, Bobbi J. Babitz, a partner at LoHi, confirmed the relationship. ""We’re an independent broker-dealer that is well-versed in the regulatory requirements associated with digital asset placements,” she said.  In the U.S., nonbank lending is typically regulated at the state level. But Blum told CoinDesk that since Lockwood and not Atomic is issuing the loans, Atomic Capital doesn’t need state lending licenses. A spokesperson for Atomic said the loans will be available in any U.S. state as long as the customer passes know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering (AML/KYC) checks.  Mark Klein, a managing director at Lockwood Group, said in a press release that his firm ""partnered with Atomic because of their strong network of global investors and leading digital investments position across technology, finance, and regulation.”  Borrower beware  It is not clear whether Lockwood will keep clients' crypto in cold (offline) storage or a hot (online) wallet, or at cryptocurrency exchanges, or some combination. Nor did the companies say whether Lockwood would trade or lend out clients' crypto while in its custody, or provide a copy of the terms and conditions for the loans.  Blum referred most of CoinDesk's questions on these matters to Klein, who did not respond to them by press time.  But in the event clients' crypto is lost, Lockwood will be responsible, Blum said:  “The loss of the cryptocurrency while in the custody of Lockwood either by poor trading or some type of cybersecurity failure would not absolve the legal obligations Lockwood has to a borrower in returning the collateral as scheduled. Atomic is comfortable with this because of both Lockwood’s highly experienced, global team of financial professionals and significant capital reserves.""  In case bitcoin or ether falls in price and the collateral loses value, Lockwood will be able to make margin calls, though the firms would not say the precise conditions allowing this.  ""In line with standard collateral-backed lending processes, borrowers are giving custody over to the lender for the term of the loan and under-collateralized loans must be restored to acceptable LTV ratios to maintain good standing as per the terms of the contract,"" Klein told CoinDesk in a message relayed by Atomic's spokesperson.  Speaking generally of the risks of lending against a notoriously volatile asset, Blum said: “Volatility, for people who know how to trade, is the best environment: the market can go in any direction and you still will be able to succeed if you can trade competently.""  The custody options will be also at Lockwood’s discretion, he said:  “That’s the nature of the agreement, you’re giving custody over and in exchange, you get a cash loan.”  Loan image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/03/atomic-capital-makes-cryptos-most-aggressive-lending-offer-yet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d58c74b14016d0b482d32f6ecdaaeb1b868507e-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422906,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qyzh,1554296432,Former Obama Tech Officer Raises $3.7 Million for Blockchain SaaS Startup,"Offchain Labs, a startup co-founded by a former Obama administration official, has raised a $3.7 million in seed funding.  The round was led by Pantera Capital and included participants such as Compound VC. Offchain Labs co-founder Ed Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton University and former deputy U.S. chief technology officer in the Obama White House, told CoinDesk his software-as-a-service (SaaS) startup will focus on “scaling smart contracts” for enterprise use cases.  “We’re focusing on private chain, enterprise solutions and the gaming space right now,” Felten said. “The current product runs as a Layer 2 on top of ethereum, but it’s also compatible with ethereum [itself].”  Stepping back, in 2017 ethereum quickly became overburdened when transactions tied to the digital collectibles app CryptoKitties flooded the network. Felten said ethereum’s scaling situation hasn’t improved dramatically since then, which creates an opportunity for companies like Offchain Labs that can apply layered scaling solutions to this evolving infrastructure.  “The on-chain costs, in ethereum gas costs, increase as the storage in your decentralized application gets bigger and the amount of code that needs to be executed gets bigger,” Felten said. “This limits the complexity and sophistication of the games you can have.”  So Offchain is taking an experimental approach to solve this issue.  Its founding team is comprised of academic researchers including Steven Goldfeder, a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell Tech who co-authored Princeton’s textbook on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  “We think we can really cut down the price you have to pay for smart contracts, with the same level of trust and confidence,” Felten said.  Reduced costs  With at least a half-dozen well-funded startups offering blockchain-related SaaS options, Felten said Offchain’s system will differentiate itself by offering the cheapest model.  Similar to BlockApps – a ConsenSys spinout that’s currently raising a Series A and graduating clients from proof-of-concept to production – Offchain Labs plans to establish industry-specific blockchain networks where clients choose who operates validators for each network.  Felten said the startup’s alpha release is scheduled for this summer, before July 1, after which it can start courting prospective clients.  “A lot of other people obviously are also shooting at that goal,” he said, acknowledging the fierce competition among SaaS startups for a small pool of blockchain-curious companies.  For another competing example, Swedish SaaS startup Chromaway raised $11 million in a private token sale late last year with Arrington XRP Capital and Neo Global Capital, according to Chromaway co-founder Or Perelman. The startup also has heavyweight business advisors like litecoin creator Charlie Lee.  With this competitive landscape in mind, Pantera Capital co-founder Joey Krug told CoinDesk that Offchain Labs will offer a clear advantage for decentralized exchanges compared to models like Chromaway's, which require that some participants or validators stake tokens to help fuel the network.  “Traders will balk at that,” Krug said. “They’ll say, 'Why do I need to put in more capital than I actually need to do my trade?' And so, the main differentiator for Offchain, I think, even though they have a great team and all the usual stuff, is going to be the lower capital requirements.”  Krug expects Offchain's alpha release in 2019 to focus on ethereum-oriented gaming apps, with subsequent adjustments based on user feedback.  “I’m excited to see some early mainnet stuff exist this year, then hopefully a wider range of applications that are actually using it in production by 2020,” Krug said.

For the first phase, the JSE and Blockstation trialed live cryptocurrency trading in January for a 60-day run that saw participation from regulated broker-dealers, market makers and the Jamaica Central Securities Depository.  The objective of the first stage was to “demonstrate the complete lifecycle of the digital asset ecosystem,” the firms said at the time.

No precise date was provided for the start of the trial.  While the two firms previously had a relationship set out in a memorandum of understanding signed last August, they have now become official partners, Blockstation added.

42381750,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oyCN,1554290117,3 Reasons Bitcoin's Price Suddenly Surged Back to $5K,"The crypto market sprang back to life with bitcoin's surge to nearly 5-month highs yesterday. But why?  To those who have been paying attention to the charts, it shouldn't come as a surprise. The leading cryptocurrency by market value jumped nearly $1,000 to $5,080 in a 60-minute window early on Tuesday, confirming a transition from bear market to bull market that it had been signaling for some time.  In fact, after a year-long bear market, savvy traders were waiting on a trend change that would gain credence if and when prices established the most basic of all bullish technical patterns – a higher low and a higher high on its weekly charts. (A higher high would have been confirmed above $4,236.)  Looking back, a big move was overdue, as bitcoin's average daily trading range had slipped to two-year lows in March. An extended period of low volatility often ends up with a violent move on either side.  That low volatility period ended with a strong bullish breakout, possibly due to the following three reasons:  1. Technicals were foreshadowing a bullish move  As mentioned, bitcoin's charts have been signaling for some time that a bottom may be in the market.  This first began in late February, when we reported that bitcoin’s 50-week moving average dropped below the 100-week moving average, confirming a bearish crossover – the first since April 2015.  https://www.coindesk.com/long-term-price-indicator-tuns-bearish-suggesting-bitcoin-may-have-finally-bottomed-out  At the time, we wrote that the lagging indicator had turned bearish for the first time in four years, suggesting bitcoin’s price may have bottomed out after a year of declining prices.  We wrote:  Put simply, it takes a great effort on the part of the bears to push the 50-week MA below the 100-week MA. As a result, the bear market is usually exhausted by the time the crossover is confirmed, which seems to be the case with BTC.  That, however, was just the beginning. Several longer duration indicators, like the weekly money flow index (MFI) and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), would add evidence to the trend.  On March 4, the MFI bottomed, contradicting the lower low in bitcoin’s price.  That bullish divergence is widely considered an early warning of a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal, a fact we noted at the time. A rising MFI indicates an increase in buying pressure, while a falling MFI is considered a sign of increasing selling pressures  https://www.coindesk.com/another-bitcoin-indicator-signals-price-bottom-may-be-forming  The same day, the MACD, a momentum oscillator calculated by subtracting the longer-term moving average from the shorter-term moving average, also turned bullish, a fact no doubt noticed by traders.  2. Mining reward halving  Yet, these technical developments likely reinforced expectations of a stronger rally ahead of the incoming halving, a scheduled, programmatic reduction in the amount of new bitcoin paid to miners.  Bitcoin is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020 and historical data indicates the process tends to put a bid under the cryptocurrency at least a year in advance. (The protocol automatically reduces new issuance after a certain number of blocks are processed, an event that occurred most recently in 2016).  https://www.coindesk.com/making-sense-bitcoins-halving  Markets first took note of this possibility in December 2018 after the sell-off ran out of steam near $3,100.  The particular price pattern was reminiscent of how the previous bear market had ended at lows near $150 in early January 2015 – 17 months before a reward halving in August 2016.  Indeed, historical data shows that bitcoin traders generally respond to the halving, and that the event serves as a signal and potential catalyst.  The narrative that BTC is set to repeat history by breaking into a bull market at least a year ahead of the next mining reward halving (due August 2020) has only strengthened over the last three months, possibly leading to the bull breakout yesterday.  Indeed, analysts had been arguing for months that with the next bitcoin halving expected to happen in May 2020, the time had come for investors to start paying attention to this pattern.  https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-next-halving-rally-coming-soon-in-2019  3. Market activity  One can't rule out market irregularities, though, and there appear to have been some yesterday.  Reuters reported Tuesday that a single algorithmically managed order worth $100 million spread across several major exchanges – Coinbase and Kraken and Bitstamp – triggered the sudden rally to multi-month highs.  Meanwhile, Bitfinex data indicates that the unwinding of bearish bets created upward pressure on prices.  BTC/USD short positions plunged from 20,654 BTC to 17,103 BTC between 04:00 and 06:00 UTC yesterday; later declining further to 16,978 BTC – the lowest level since March 2018.  What's ahead  Looking forward, BTC could witness a minor pullback to levels below $4,700 in the short-term. The overall outlook, however, will remain bullish as long as BTC remains above $4,236.        BTC revisited yesterday's high of $5,080 earlier today. The bullish move, however, was accompanied by a lower high on the relative strength index (RSI).  That bearish divergence indicates scope for a pullback to the ascending (bullish) 50-hour MA, currently at $4,572.  But both the triangle breakout and the bullish higher high above $4,236 indicate the tide has turned in favor of the bulls. Validating that argument are the ascending 5- and 10-week moving averages.  That said, with the short duration charts reporting overbought conditions, a break above the crucial 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,200, may not happen in the next few days.

Celo announced Tuesday that the two investors have purchased $15 million and $10 million in the project's Celo Gold tokens, respectively.  The token-based funding effort also saw participation from “several other leading institutions” from across the world, Celo said, with the amounts not being disclosed.  Celo's protocol is designed to be mobile-friendly and ""ultralight,"" allowing funds to be sent to cellphone numbers. The Celo Gold token it describes as a ""deflationary"" cryptocurrency that cuts down on price volatility. The startup also offers another token, the Celo Dollar, which is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.  On the business level, it aims to enable easier remittances, cash-transfer programs and micropayments through its open-source platform, taking an initial focus on helping unbanked or underbanked people.  The firm said:  “We strongly believe that anyone, regardless of their location or socio-economic status, should have access to basic financial tools for storing and transmitting currency.”  Celo has recently run pilots of the “easy-to-use wallet app” in Argentina and Tanzania enabling ""verified"" users and merchants to send and receive small payments. It is planning to release a public testnet of its platform this summer, according to the announcement.  It's also been attracting some notable talent recently. Chuck Kimble, former head of financial institution partnerships at Circle, joined Celo in February as head of strategic partnership. And, in September, former Ripple general counsel Brynly Llyr took on the same role at Celo.  In Tuesday's announcement, the firm added that it now has over 40 contributors to the project internationally, drawing expertise from the World Bank Group and the UN; tech firms like Google, Microsoft and Apple; and financial companies such as PayPal and Morgan Stanley. Academia is involved too, and individuals at MIT, Stanford, Harvard and Berkeley are also assisting.

42381742,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oy2J,1554265833,5-Star Swiss Hotel Set to Accept Bitcoin Payments,"The Dolder Grand, a five-star hotel based in Switzerland, will begin accepting bitcoin payments starting next month.  The news was announced Tuesday by the hotel’s tech partner, Inacta AG, which said that the payment option would be made available on May 1.  Once the new payment method goes live, guests can pay for accommodation, food and beverages or spa treatments using bitcoin. Inacta AG’s mobile app Inapay will then convert bitcoin payments into Swiss franc or euro “as soon as the payment has been completed,” according to the statement, meaning that the hotel itself won't handle cryptocurrency.  The Dolder Grand’s director of finance André Meier said in a statement:  “Many of the improvements in our service in recent years were made possible by advances in technology. As we believe Bitcoin is here to stay, it only seems natural to offer more choices in the payment process.”  The bitcoin payment option was featured earlier as part of a pilot project with Inacta AG.  Hotels across the world have been accepting cryptocurrency payments since as early as 2014. U.S.-based travel agency CheapAir started service to allow bitcoin users to book hotel stays with the cryptocurrency back in February 2014.  In July of that year, Canada-based Sandman Hotel Group started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for room reservations. More recently, Spain-based Casual Hoteles started accepting bitcoin payments on a pilot basis in February 2019.
