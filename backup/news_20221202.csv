The flagship front end application of the blockchain is Socios - a professional sports fan token issuer. Fan tokens are a far more active market than NFTs and figure to have far more staying power than the avatar mania of 2021. US regulators are the major hurdle but the development team behind Socios has been very cautious because of jurisdiction risk. As the broad crypto market tries to find a direction to close out the year, there have been a variety of coins in the space that have held up considerably well since the FTX (FTT-USD) meltdown. Some are even up over 100% since the June lows. One such coin is Chiliz ( CHZ-USD ). Chiliz is considered a ""creator economy"" or ""community token"" that was founded in 2017 by Alexandre Dreyfus. In this article we'll look at the token supply metrics, the current focus of the core development team, the market performance of the core product, and key risks to consider before buying the token. Token Specs The Chiliz blockchain is essentially a side chain that was built on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). There are currently a little over 6 billion CHZ tokens in the circulating supply with 8.88 billion as a supply cap: Max Token Supply: 8.88 billion Circulating Supply: 6.14 billion (69%) Token Price: $0.17 Market capitalization: $1 billion Fully diluted cap: $1.5 billion Market Cap Rank: 41 The original token distribution had over 3 billion CHZ going to early investors from a token pre-mine sale. CHZ Distribution (Chiliz) Those investors include Jump Capital and Binance Labs ( BNB-USD ) among others. The current token distribution shows over 65% of the CHZ is held by the top 10 wallet addresses. Top 10 CHZ Addresses (Etherscan) Two of those wallet addresses are Binance addresses and the largest holder is a multisig wallet that is under the control of Chiliz. This is a fairly large centralization of control compared to other creator economy tokens like Basic Attention Token ( BAT-USD ) for example . But the centralization of the Chiliz chain has been somewhat by design. Socios The first application built on top of the Chiliz blockchain is Socios. Socios is the main consumer front end of the Chiliz blockchain at the moment and the same team behind Chiliz is behind Socios. Socios is a sports entertainment platform that allows fans of certain professional sports clubs to purchase ""fan tokens"" of those clubs. These fan tokens could be viewed somewhat similarly to NFTs though they have a strong voting power associated with each token. Holders of the tokens are able to vote on real decisions by the clubs for which the tokens are associated. For instance, holders of the Manchester City token can vote on what kind of uniform they want the team to wear on a given day or which songs they would like to hear played in the stadium following goals. These tokens don't give holders influence over organizational decisions like roster building or employee staffing. The tokens can largely be viewed as supercharged fan club memberships with special powers. The important aspect of the Socios platform and all of the fan tokens built on the Chiliz chain is the need for CHZ tokens for the transactions. For fans to buy tokens of their favorite teams, they have to have the CHZ tokens as the in-app currency. While all of the CHZ isn't currently in circulation, the remaining dilution risk is much less of a concern than it is in some of the other popular community or creator tokens. Initially the Chiliz blockchain was a closed chain that was used to focus entirely on building Socios as a proof of concept. The team behind the chain is now calling it a PoSA chain, which stands for ""Proof of Stake Authority."" Chiliz says this will allow the network to become more open to approved projects and protocols running on the Chiliz network and it will make Chiliz less dependent on Socios going forward. Market Response The fan token experiment has been a fairly large success so far in my opinion. There are just under 1.8 million wallet addresses on the chain and 28.8 million total transactions. The project has had important endorsements from world class athletes like Lionel Messi . Additionally, numerous professional sports organizations in the NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLS have signed on as partners. NFL Partners (Socios) Despite the interest from US-based organizations, to this point only international clubs have released fan tokens to further engage with their communities. But even as the crypto market has struggled and the NFT market has collapsed, CHZ has seen a very positive trend in weekly active users since August: CHZ Weekly Actives (Dune Analytics/lcai) Given the enormous footprint of international club partnerships on the Socios platform, a large part of this surge in weekly active users is no doubt the anticipation for the FIFA World Cup. Additionally, the market for fan tokens seems to have more staying power than the explosion of pointless avatar NFT projects. This is evidenced by the nearly 3 to 1 advantage fan tokens have historically over NFTs in gross sales volume: All time Sales Volume Non Fungible Tokens $41.3 billion Fan Tokens $113.5 billion Source: CryptoSlam To be clear, a large portion of this volume is certainly just speculative swapping of tokens back and forth by a small number of actors. Regardless, I think there is quite a bit of potential for real utility of the Chiliz blockchain if Socios is opened up for the American market. And that gets us to the key risk. Risks There is no guarantee that the Socios consumer front end of Chiliz will ever be viewed positively by regulators in the United States. But the organization behind Socios has taken a very cautious approach with jurisdiction risk as the platform is not available to US consumers and no US sports organizations have issued tokens through the Chiliz blockchain. In my view, that caution has likely been very wise. If fan tokens for professional teams in the US are ultimately allowed, I believe the ceiling for CHZ is very high. If the fan tokens are not allowed domestically, CHZ could still move up considerably as long as there is still international interest in Socios and fan tokens without US clubs. So far, the interest in international club tokens has been real but it is definitely concerning that the tokens have been used for speculation to the degree that they have. Despite the lack of access to Socios, US consumers are still able to purchase CHZ through various exchanges and DeFi swapping protocols. Summary I've explored Chiliz in my BlockChain Reaction service previously and I've gone into quite a bit more detail about what I like about the CHZ token. You can read the deeper analysis here . I've given CHZ the ""top token idea"" designation in the service and it has been one of the best performing assets in both the BlockChain Reaction portfolio and the overall crypto market since that designation. We're still very much in crypto winter. Nobody knows how long this will last or how low some of these coins will go. But if you're looking for solid long-term speculative bets in this market that have a high potential return, I think CHZ is definitely one to put on your radar while the market continues to weed out poor coins.",POSITIVE,BAT | CHZ,BAT | BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | MARKET | CHZ,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4562100-chiliz-add-this-one-to-your-stocking-crypto-winter?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5070857.jpeg
5070513,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4562097-million-dollar-bitcoin-here-is-how-it-can-happen?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1670023966,'Million Dollar Bitcoin': Here's How It Can Happen,"Summary Bitcoin has a unique characteristic as a financial asset: it is nobody else’s liability. This makes it particularly attractive to central banks the world over. Central banks hold a total of between $40 trillion and $50 trillion in reserve assets. Should they wish to diversify their dollar holdings over time toward crypto assets, this would be a powerful source of Bitcoin demand, potentially to a BTC price of $1 million. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood’s call on Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting ""$1 million by 2030"" in late November 2022 was widely received as outlandish, but Bitcoin's features are such that this scenario cannot be ruled out. BTC shares with gold and silver a unique characteristic for a financial asset: it is nobody else’s liability. This is often touted by Bitcoin promoters as a way to shield citizens’ assets from the legacy banking system perceived as predatory when it comes to fund transfers, and lacking as regards privacy. Holding Bitcoin in cold storage is a guarantee of complete control of one’s holding, while a bank account can only be accessed with the bank assent. It is important to stress that only cold storage entails this unique characteristic: holding Bitcoin with an institution, be it an intermediary or an exchange, deprives Bitcoin of this most precious quality, as FTX customers just found out. While this clearly is important to certain individuals -libertarians in particular- this is even more important for countries: central banks hold reserve assets in order to ensure they can fund imports from abroad as needed or to prop up the value of their national currency when it becomes under pressure if investors exit the country. Currently, the bulk of these reserve assets are in US$ and, for some countries, in gold. The relationships between the world central banks is what comprises the International Monetary System, namely the links that allow trade between countries (imports and exports) and cross border financing and investments. The international monetary system is built on the US$ as the reserve currency. What is a reserve currency? It is the currency unanimously accepted as settlement for cross border transactions. It is also the currency in which commodities and oil are denominated. The US$, as all fiat currencies, is the liability of the central bank issuing it, the Fed in this case. As all fiat currencies, the dollar is in fact debt. It is debt issued by the dominant country, the US. As cross border trade and investment expand, there is a need for a steady supply of reserve currency, so the issuing country can add to its debt, which we in the US happily do. Adding to debt for a country means consuming more than producing, so importing more than exporting, running a trade deficit, and Congress spending more than tax receipts, running a budget deficit. Economists call the resulting shortfall “running a current account deficit”, namely having foreigners finance your excess spending. So essentially issuing a reserve currency is akin to an individual signing off on the grocery store invoice and never paying for it, as the shop owner can use the signed invoice to pay its vendors or creditors who are accepting the claim on that privileged individual as settlement. We in the US are that privileged individual. This alleviates the US budget constraint: we can spend more than we produce. It also gives the US a fearsome power over other countries. We can impose biting sanctions on hostile foreigners: North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and now Russia can attest to that. What happens if the acceptance of US IOUs as mean of settlement - and the power this entails for the US - becomes questioned? There would be a need for a substitute asset. This actually happened in the past as in the ‘60s France’s General de Gaulle and the French economist Jacques Rueff deemed the US$ role as an “exorbitant privilege” and moved France’s gold from the New York Fed vaults back to Paris. De Gaulle’s political legacy essentially wilted and nothing came out of it. But the current situation is different. In particular, the China/US fault line is widening. Sanctions on Russia have sent a clear US message to would be dissenters: “You can run but you can’t hide since your assets are our liability, so they’re as good as we want them to be”. Should that message encourage US$ holders to try and diversify away from the Greenback, the question becomes what substitute could, if not replace, at least complement the dollar? Gold is the existing candidate: Gold indeed is nobody else’s liability: it is already a traditional central bank reserve asset. Its role is hampered by its unequal repartition. It is mostly held by the traditional advanced economies, the US and Continental Europe. It also suffers from cumbersome transfer procedures for settlement purposes. It is equally poorly divisible. There is definitely room for an alternative asset sharing gold’s characteristics but devoid of those drawbacks. Crypto assets held in cold storage solve all above issues. Others have advocated this idea. Let’s stress that Central banks have already developed a keen interest in digital currencies, but for the wrong reasons: Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) would be the national central bank’s liability - much different from Bitcoin - and would in fact potentially allow greater government control over citizens. The Fed published an extensive study on CBDCs, highlighting privacy concerns as well as impacts on the legacy banking system. Elsewhere, the digital yuan is already widely used in China, at an experimental stage, potentially eliminating any privacy for local citizens. Bitcoin’s finite nature is a key part of its attraction. True, there’s no shortage of competition from other cryptos. Nevertheless, Bitcoin's decentralization and security are peerless among crypto assets and therefore make it appropriate as a global unimpeded reserve asset. It is scarce, fungible, immutable, un-seizable, pseudonymous, peer to peer, not requiring trust or permission. As such, Bitcoin checks all the boxes of the ideal reserve asset: held in cold storage, it is the ultimate holding providing ironclad benefits as a last resort store of value. Should the move toward using the BTC as a reserve asset materialize, price implications would obviously be dramatic. Currently, the total of central banks' reserve assets amounts to anywhere between $40 trillion and $50 trillion. Should half of those reserves be over time converted into BTC, $25 trillion would be chasing the total amount of 21 million BTC. The math is easy to do, we would indeed be looking at a BTC price of roughly $1.2 million. In contrast to Cathie Wood, I do not expect this to happen between now and 2030. Still, I do not rule out a phasing in of BTC holdings by central banks for all the reasons above. This would provide a strong official sector demand propping up the value of Bitcoin, potentially to that mystic million dollar number over time. Risks to this scenario So far, only a small country, El Salvador, has decided to add Bitcoin to the foreign reserves, triggering strong criticism from the International Monetary Fund, not keen in allowing countries to break free of IMF dependency. Russia’s fate as being kicked out of access to its reserves may nevertheless inspire others in diversifying their assets away from other countries' liabilities. Bitcoin offers such an option, as gold is already concentrated among few countries. Bitcoin volatility can also be viewed as a major deterrent, since a reserve asset needs to have a predictable value. A move toward its inclusion among reserve assets would to a large extent provide Bitcoin with a legitimacy likely to propel its value higher, way higher, and trigger a virtuous cycle where the current untethered value (pun intended) would be replaced by an orderly appreciation followed by a stabilization at a high level.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4562097-million-dollar-bitcoin-here-is-how-it-can-happen?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5070513.jpeg

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Celsius had put a few of its assets up for sale after filing for bankruptcyin July following a downturn in the crypto market.  Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but Galaxy spokesman Michael Wursthorn said the price was materially less than what Celsius had paid a year ago. Celsius had acquired GK8 in November 2021 for $115 million, as reported.  Galaxy's aim with the acquisition is to expand its prime brokerage offering. Around 40 people would be joining Galaxy's team, including blockchain engineers and cryptographers.  Expand Galaxy's global footprint with a new office in Tel Aviv, Israel, is a major outcome of the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval. “Adding GK8 to our prime offering at this pivotal moment for our industry also highlights our continued willingness to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow Galaxy in a sustainable manner,” Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy, said in the release.  Previously, in August, Galaxy abandoned its planto buy crypto custody specialist BitGo for $1.2 billion. At the time Galaxy said BitGo had failed to provide financial statements by a deadline of July 31. The cancellation of the deal prompted BitGo to sue Galaxy for damages in September.  Other News  Liquidators for Three Arrows Capital have seized $35.6 million from the collapsed crypto hedge fund’s bank accounts in Singapore, according to a presentation used in a court hearing on Friday. The money seized by Teneo – the New York-based liquidation firm appointed by a British Virgin Islands court – is the largest chunk of money obtained since Three Arrows imploded in July, leaving a $3.5 billion debt in its wake.  An unknown group of attackers were able to drain some $15 million in liquidity from BNB Chain-based staking platform Helio on Friday morning after exploiting an oracle issue on the protocol, on-chain data shows. The Helio exploit came hours after the decentralized finance protocol Ankr was attacked for $5 million. The Ankr attacker was able to mint 6 quadrillion aBNBc tokens, which they eventually turned into roughly 5 million USDC, as CoinDesk reported.  U.S. economy added an unexpected robust 263,000 jobs in November. Bitcoin was recently hovering near $17,000, recovering from an earlier slide on the news, whereas equities were mixed following the strong job report. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.12% and 0.18%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1%. Data from crypto analysis firm IntoTheBlock shows bitcoin's 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 dropped to -0.8, hitting its lowest point since May 2019. “The contrast between crypto's internal troubles and macro's positive tailwinds have led the two to become negatively correlated,” Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, wrote in a Friday note.

Bitcoin Miners’ Position Index Has Spiked Up During Past Day As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, this instance is the fifth time that the metric has sent a warning signal. The “Miners’ Position Index” (or the MPI in short) is an indicator that measures the ratio between the miner outflows in USD, and the 365-day moving average of the same. Generally, miners transfer coins out of their wallets (that is, make outflow transactions) for selling purposes. Thus, the MPI can tell us whether miners are selling more or less right now compared to their past year average. When the value of this metric is high, it means miners are dumping more than usual currently. On the other hand, low values suggest these chain validators aren’t doing any heavy selling at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Usher In December Near $18,000 If It Moves Past This Resistance Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MPI over the past year and a half: The value of the metric seems to have been pretty high recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, whenever the Bitcoin Miners’ Position Index has crossed above a value of 2 during the past year, the price of the crypto has seen a decline shortly after. There have been five such spikes in 2022 so far, the latest of which has only just been recorded in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $17,000, But Is It Too Early To Call The All Clear On The Bear Market? This current surge has now taken the indicator’s value to the highest level since the spike back in April of this year. When this previous spike was seen, Bitcoin was above $45k, but only a week later the crypto had crashed below $40k. If the latest rise in miner selling also follows the same trend as back in April, then BTC may observe some downtrend in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16.9k, up 3% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has lost 17% in value.

42411702,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfEfI,1670011380,Let’s Get 'Phygital': Combining the Physical and Digital in Web3,"The rapid rise of non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the metaverse in the past year has given rise to new types of projects and new use cases. One emerging use case in this space is the utility NFT, a type of NFT designed to provide holders with additional value beyond the actual digital asset.  Utility NFTs provide access and items for individuals looking to engage with brands and participate in the project’s culture. For crypto-native and Web2 brands in both fashion and entertainment, Web3 presents an opportunity to bring both digital and real-world items and experiences to its audience. This new popular pairing of the physical and digital world has led to it getting its own word: phygital.  The concept, simply, is that the project is not just in the digital space or the physical world but bridges both worlds, connecting them together in some way.  The concept of creating phygital products and experiences has led to some of the top consumer brands in the world to contribute to Web3 with their take on phygital ideas. Nike, Dolce & Gabbana, Tiffany & Co. and many others have created unique phygital offerings and experiences.  See Also: Who What Wearables: A Guide to Digital Fashion and the Metaverse  Depending on the company's particular offering, unique phygital pairings brought about new products that felt less like objects and more like experiences.  Take Nike’s early phygital experience as an example. In late 2019, Nike revealed that it had obtained a patent for blockchain-based sneakers. As it continued to move toward phygital experiences, Nike went on to acquire NFT sneaker studio RTFKT Studios. This acquisition led to the launch of Nike’s metaverse sneaker line RTFKT x Nike Dunk Genesis CryptoKicks. By purchasing one of these NFTs, you are able to wear your sneakers in the metaverse and claim the right to owning your own pair in the real world to match.  Fashion has certainly taken center stage in the rise of phygital activations, pairing the traditional in-person runway show with new, digitally created looks or staging Web3 fashion week shows in the metaverse. The pairing of real-world items with in-game or in-metaverse items for your avatars makes for a straightforward example of how these events work. Yet, the phygital world is not limited to just fashion and sneakers.  Read More: Dolce & Gabbana’s First NFT Collection Sells for $5.7M  Collectible projects have also begun to develop in the phygital space. In September 2022, for example, Funko Teams and Warner Brothers announced a partnership for DC comic-based NFTs on WAX. Through the partnership, DC fans were given the opportunity to participate in an NFT drop for the digital version of DC’s “The Brave and the Bold” comic.  To better bridge the digital experience with the physical, the brands also announced the release of a physical version of the comic book available through Walmart. By either purchasing the digital or physical copy, you would gain access to the other with your purchase.  The recent trend toward providing real-world utility in the phygital world has captured the imagination of creators and brands alike. By marrying the physical and digital worlds, phygital drops are moving beyond just purchasing an item for display to creating something more, by bringing pieces of the real and the virtual world together to create unique experiences.

The BTC price has yet to reclaim that level at around $17,500. Bitcoin Continues The Struggle, A New Status Quo Is In The Making Over the previous week, the market rushed to the upside on the back of a potential U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy pivot. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a change in their strategy during a speech at the Brookings Institution. Powell spoke about moderation for the first time in months since hiking interest rates to slow down inflation. During this speech, the Fed Chair said: Thus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down. The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting. Bitcoin, crypto, and legacy financial markets were trending to the downside due to this monetary policy. Powell speaking of moderation gave them room to rally, but today the U.S. posted data on its job sectors that killed the bullish sentiment in the market. The nonfarm payrolls and private payrolls came in hotter than expected. The market was expecting much lower results. The metrics recorded 263,000 and 221,000, respectively. This data hints at a strong jobs market, which contributes to inflation, and allows the Fed to keep hiking rates. OOPS! No Goldi-lockish US jobs data. A bit too hot! pic.twitter.com/djivTXhgy0 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) December 2, 2022 Immediately after this data became public, the market began pricing in a higher probability of a 75-basis point (bps) hike in interest for December.

42414809,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBLS3V,1670009219,Crypto Derivatives DEXs Reposition for Life After FTX,"The collapse of crypto derivatives exchange FTX is driving more attention to its on-chain competitors and prompting these decentralized exchanges (DEX) to double down as an alternative.  Whether they can win the trust of the trading public is yet to be seen. But on a DEX it is virtually impossible to inconspicuously commingle funds (as the FTX centralized exchange appears to have done) when everything’s traceable on the blockchain.  That’s driven lots of new interest to some of the earliest decentralized players. Dan Gunsberg, creator of Solana-based derivatives exchange Hxro, said that in recent weeks he’s seen a boom in interest for his trading platform, which he claims cannot fall prey to the same pain points that felled FTX and its sister company, Alameda.  “This was not a [decentralized finance] problem,” Gunsberg said of the latest market collapse. “FTX and Alameda, as far as we know, were incredibly centralized, controlled by a single person. These things metastasize because of human error.”  DeFi is hardly a magic salve for crypto’s multi-billion-dollar woes. Protocols can get hacked, duped, drained and worse, costing their users massive aggregate losses. In contrast with the “black boxes” of centralized exchanges, though, DEXs operate according to their open-source code. Gunsberg noted DEXs have on-chain assets that are open for all to see – so long as one knows where to look.  That’s easier said than done, however, and lay traders can’t always navigate the block explorers and datasets that – though public – speak to the state of an on-chain exchange’s status. Some DEXs are now working to make this data more accessible.  Drift Protocol, GMX and Perpetual Protocol have commissioned asset dashboards on data site Nansen that showcase the health of their respective exchanges. Among the information included in the dashboards are token allocations and debts owed by the protocols.  Their efforts are the on-chain equivalent of the “proof of reserves” movement sweeping across centralized exchanges now jostling to prove their words are good with hard data. Even that has its limits, however. Whatever one wants to call it – proof of reserve, proof of liability, proof of deposit or something else – that report only speaks to a moment in time.  At the same time, many decentralized protocols are readying their defenses against an expected regulatory onslaught. Their fear is that financial regulators, already spooked by FTX's apparent misdeeds, will want to regulate DeFi, too.  “A lot of us raised concerns about how DeFi derivatives platforms do not have a strong voice,” said David Lu, co-founder of Drift Protocol. He said GMX, Drift, Perpetual Protocol as well as dYdX are pooling their efforts to have a larger collective clout.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/02/crypto-derivatives-dexes-reposition-for-life-after-ftx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f416525cabd1e1a19711c7febfef05b5f1a8aac-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414805,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBLRiH,1670006267,Three Arrows Capital Liquidators Seize $35.6M From Singaporean Banks,"Liquidators for Three Arrows Capital have seized $35.6 million from the collapsed crypto hedge fund’s bank accounts in Singapore, three months after getting the nod from that country’s High Court to begin probing the firm's assets in the country.  The money seized by Teneo – the New York-based liquidation firm appointed by a British Virgin Islands court – is the largest chunk of money obtained since Three Arrows imploded in July, leaving a $3.5 billion debt in its wake.  According to a presentation used in a court hearing on Friday, liquidators have also recovered $2.8 million from forced redemptions of investments, as well as an unspecified number of crypto tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Liquidators’ task of hunting down and preserving Three Arrows' remaining assets so that they can be returned to investors isn't an easy one, and the hedge fund's founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu haven't made it any easier, according to Teneo, which said both men have been uncooperative since the summer.  Now that Su and Davies have resumed posting on Twitter and talking to the media, liquidators appear to be even more frustrated with their lack of cooperation. According to the hearing presentation, liquidators have had only very limited communication with Su, Davies and their lawyers.  Lack of cooperation  On July 6, five days after Three Arrows, which is also known as 3AC, filed for bankruptcy, Su and Davies appeared at an introductory Zoom call with lawyers for the hedge fund, but kept their cameras and microphones off and didn't respond to direct questions. Since then, Teneo said it has had only one call with each of the founders, both occurring in August, and lawyers for Su and Davies have failed to provide a complete set of financial records.  Su and Davies claim to be in Dubai and Bali, respectively – and liquidators point out that both places are “jurisdictions known for difficulties in enforcing foreign court orders.”  Liquidators also say that, beginning in mid-June, Su and Davies “engaged security experts … to, among other things, establish secure communications between designated individuals that could be deleted.” They also said that 3AC’s investment manager has also been uncooperative.  When liquidators gained access to the fund’s Singapore office, “most physical documents, servers and hard drives had been removed,” according to the documents published Friday. Liquidators claimed as false a 3AC lawyer statement that all the requested information (including historical asset information and logins to 3AC’s brokerage and trading accounts) had been shared.  Not-So-Superyacht  Liquidators also addressed the status of the $50 million, 500-ton superyacht – christened the Much Wow – Su and Davies purchased before their company collapsed. New York Magazine reported in August that Su and Davies bragged to acquaintances that it would be “bigger than all of the richest billionaires’ yachts in Singapore.”  According to the presentation, liquidators confirmed that Su and Davies made payments for the yacht directly from the company’s coffers. When that money dried up, the contract to purchase Much Wow was terminated by the ship’s builder Sanlorenzo, and the yacht was put back on the market.  Liquidators say Sanlorenzo holds the proceeds from the sale of the Much Wow and will distribute the money to a holding company called Much Wow Ltd., which liquidators have filed a $30 million claim against in the Cayman Islands.  Calls for truth  Part of Su's and Davies’ timing for their return to the public eye has seemingly been based on the even-bigger collapse of Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX and the fall from grace of its founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.  Liquidators pointed out that Su has tweeted (in regards to FTX’s collapse) that “the time for truth to surface is now” and Davies has called on Bankman-Fried to “chat, with transparency, in a forum where those [he has] inflicted pain upon can tune in” – something he added Bankman-Fried clearly has time for, since “[he’s] had the time to write multiple letters, and even sign up to a CNBC interview.”  Liquidators said Friday that Su’s and Davies’ “calls for truth should be heard” – no doubt a reference to the 3AC case as much as to FTX.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/02/three-arrows-capital-liquidators-seize-356m-from-singaporean-banks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ba5e7e655a936794c78e6a666232481f65a6123-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411307,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMmTN,1670005558,Sam Bankman-Fried's Self-Incrimination Tour,"FTX and Alameda Research founder Sam Bankman-Fried has spent the week on what may be a genuinely unprecedented media tour, sitting for a series of extended interviews, even in the face of his likely imminent arrest for criminal financial fraud.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  One of those interviews, with the New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin, was already scheduled before the unmasking of FTX and Alameda in November. But Bankman-Fried also sat for a surprise interview with George Stephanopoulos at ABC’s ""Good Morning America.""  On Thursday night, he subjected himself to a sometimes hapless but undeniably intense grilling in a Twitter Space. We also got a new interview with Jen Wieczner over at New York magazine. A novice crypto enthusiast named Tiffany Wong released a prior conversation. There’s probably more to come.  There’s some strategy to this. Bankman-Fried wants to tell the world his version of events, according to which FTX was brought down by the larger crypto market slump and, at worst, his inattention to detail. As I’ve detailed both in excruciating detail and in more convenient tweet form, this is disconnected from reality. Sorkin and Stephanopoulos, to their credit, didn’t appear to buy it.  Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried has admitted that his legal advisers really, really wished he wasn’t doing this media tour. It’s seemingly why his prior legal team fired him as a client. It was very good advice, because he has wound up directly implicating himself in a variety of ways.  See also: What a Securities Lawyer Would Ask FTX's Bankman-Fried | Opinion  SBF has repeatedly seemed to admit to, or come close to admitting to, specific corrupt practices at FTX and Alameda. Some of these were previously either contained only in dry legal documents or just merely suspected. These statements – in his own words, and on the public record ­– could prove extremely harmful to him in a courtroom.  A few highlights in brief:  Though couched in obfuscated language full of strategic omissions, Bankman-Fried has effectively admitted to commingling funds between Alameda and FTX, under admirably sustained questioning from both Sorkin and Stephanopoulos.  In the interview with Wieczner, Bankman-Fried effectively admitted to Alameda’s special exemption from margin rules. Bloomberg’s Matt Levine unpacks this in depth here.  In the Twitter Spaces event on Thursday, Bankman-Fried seemed to admit that when some customers bought bitcoin on FTX, the exchange never actually purchased and held the BTC. That is, FTX was selling so-called “paper bitcoin” that appeared as BTC balances on the exchange but that was unbacked by any real tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain.  And these are just examples: There’s almost certainly a lot more in there to be unpacked.  Bankman-Fried may think he’s insulating himself by couching these admissions with caveats like “I believe” and “that’s my impression.” But given he was the CEO, with ultimate oversight responsibility, these hedges may not accomplish much in court.  So why?  There are a few ways to explain the incredible overexposure that Sam Bankman-Fried has thirstily pursued in recent days.  The most obvious is that, while Bankman-Fried is defying whatever legal and PR advisers he can still afford to pay, he is nonetheless pursuing a “strategy” of his own devising. Despite the admissions above, he is advancing an obfuscated version of events according to which he was hapless, distracted and not really in charge of anything going on at FTX. In effect, he is building the foundation for a criminal defense in which he would be portrayed as incompetent, but not criminal, with Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison perhaps thrown under the bus in his stead.  Bankman-Fried’s self-presentation in these interviews seem almost tailored to buttress the impression of ineptitude and distraction. In his conversation with Sorkin, Bankman-Fried jittered nervously. With Stephanopoulos, SBF avoided eye contact and hunched into himself meekly, like a naughty child begging forgiveness of an indulgent parent. Such body language could certainly be coached. But this approach – what you might call the “smol bean defense” – recently failed Theranos fraudster Elizabeth Holmes, who is on her way to federal prison.  But the more interesting and likely theory is that there is no strategy here at all – just a cornered man following his worst instincts into some very bad decisions. Dan Primack at Axios floated the idea that Bankman-Fried is simply feeling lonely and isolated, is psychologically incapable of handling that and is turning to journalists as surrogate friends.  CoinDesk podcast host Nathaniel Whittemore did some similar psychologizing, positing that Bankman-Fried was suffering from “congenital main character syndrome.” Bankman-Fried has spent the past two to three years at the center of public attention and praise, and, the theory goes, that’s very hard to give up.

Read more: CFTC Chairman Suggests 'Pause' to Overhaul Senate Bill Following FTX Debacle  For investors and consumers relying on centralized crypto exchanges like FTX, Evans said there’s a need for federal guardrails, protections and greater transparency.

42411300,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMm6E,1669999228,Brands Will Save Crypto? Be Careful What You Wish For,"On Nov. 14, as the rapidly widening contagion from the FTX exchange’s collapse was thrusting crypto into an existential crisis, shoemaking giant Nike launched its bold new Web3 platform, SWOOSH.  The initiative, which will allow Nike sneaker fans to buy and sell the brand’s digital wearables and to create their own collectibles powered by non-fungible tokens, is one of many such projects from household brands that are powering along as if nothing has happened in the wider world of crypto. These include Starbucks, the National Football League and its players, Instagram, Budweiser, Adidas, Dolce & Gabbana and Time. The list goes on.  It’s why a common refrain I heard, during conversations with the NFT crowd during Art Basel in Miami this week, was that crypto will be saved by brands.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  That may be the case, and it’s all well and good that spending on such projects will help offset the big pullback in expenditure by native crypto companies. But it also evokes concern among many who were drawn to this industry’s rebellious, disruptive appeal and by its promise to level the playing field by giving creators and users greater control over their money, content and data.  The question we must ask is: As crypto gets corporatized, will it lose its edge?  Mixed signals  To an extent, the answer is unavoidably yes. The crypto industry will have to bend to the legal and marketing concerns of image-conscious, bureaucratic public companies. Already it’s clear that trigger words like “crypto,” “blockchain” and even “NFTs” are being excluded from materials in favor of the generic idea of “digital collectibles.”  All is not lost, though. So far, brands’ activities in this space seem born of the right, inclusive spirit. There is a real effort, for example, to give artists, musicians and writers greater control over their work, to dramatically boost the royalties they receive and to seek out diverse creative backgrounds and styles. At a Miami event honoring the artists behind Time Magazine’s Timepieces NFT series, many said they felt appreciated and empowered by what Time, under the leadership of outgoing President Keith Grossman, has built.  Read more: NFTs and Intellectual Property: What Do You Actually Own?  There’s even a similar vibe at Instagram, which as a subsidiary of Meta Platforms is often viewed as an extension of the social media giant’s massive control over people’s data, content and lives. The platform’s latest trial with a group of NFT-savvy influencers not only allows them to make, buy and sell collectible content, they can also use the technology to build new exclusive-access business models, working directly with their most loyal audience members. At least in spirit, it hews to the Web3 principles of pushing control and ownership to creators and users.  But before we start celebrating the liberation of struggling artists everywhere, let’s recall that Meta itself started out its metaverse project with plans to charge fees of up to 47.5% for the privilege of using it. That monopoly-like pricing model prompted both anger and laughter from the crypto community.  Already the Web3 economy emerging from these brands’ ad hoc projects is rife with contradictions. We must disentangle them if we are to properly assert the principles of competition and ease of access that are needed to assume an open, disintermediated Web3 future.  Consider the pricing and fee structure that artists working with the new Instagram NFT project face.  On the one hand, it bars influencers from pricing their works higher than $1,000. Although this in itself is a form of market restriction, the price limit is being welcomed as a way to allow more inclusivity than, say, marketplace OpenSea, where NFTs sold at multi-million-dollar prices to crypto-rich collectors at the height of last year’s boom. It could encourage broader participation and allow the NFT business model to evolve into one that’s more inclusive of the mainstream.  On the other hand, artists involved in the project are having to hand over a fee of 30% for each sale.  Is this, yet again, the curse of control by an overly powerful, intermediating internet platform? Well, yes, but it turns out the monopoly is not Instagram’s, which isn’t charging anything to its artists, but Apple’s. The iPhone producer is hitting Instagram with its routine fee for all products sold over apps purchased via its app store.  But before you get into a lather of outrage at CEO Tim Cook, let’s look at that egalitarian pricing structure. Where did it come from? Turns out it’s also based on Apple’s rules.  Read more: Apple Refuses to Exempt NFTs From App Store’s 30% Fee  First principles  All of this offers a reminder that in Web2, centralized platforms like Meta and Apple have enormous power to shape the information, art and entertainment markets on which society, indeed our democracy and culture, depend.  This is why open metaverse projects such as Punk 6529’s Om and Lamina1, founded by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Vessenes and sci-fi author Neal Stephenson, are important. In different ways, they are both built on first-principle frameworks that aim to prevent anyone from controlling any core applications or infrastructure and from setting up rent-seeking gateways through which creators or users would have to enter their worlds.  Read more: NFT Investor Animoca Brands to Start $2B Metaverse Fund: Report  It’s not enough to depend on the goodwill of legacy platforms and of the mega-companies that use them to reach audiences and customers. We must deliberately build systems over which those corporate machines can’t exert control.  That is the core spirit of crypto and it provides a message to the rebellious coders and censorship-resisting creators who’ve been drawn to it: It’s okay to accept these companies’ money but look hard at what strings are attached, and then make sure enough of that funding finds its way to those who can build the decentralized protocols, applications and APIs needed to keep the system open.

42414798,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBLRN3,1669998962,Bitcoin Miners’ FTX Contagion Exposure May Amplify Industry Pain,"Bitcoin miners, which already have up to $2.5 billion in loans outstanding, could find themselves in even hotter water as many have exposure to failed crypto exchange FTX and lenders such as BlockFi.  Miners’ balance sheets have been steadily deteriorating over the past few months as the price of bitcoin has slumped, killing their revenue. Meanwhile, energy prices have soared, increasing their costs. This has resulted in one of the biggest mining data center operators in the U.S., Compute North, to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, while big players such as Core Scientific (CORZ), Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Greenidge Generation (GREE) have said they are in a liquidity crunch. The stock prices of all three publicly traded miners have plunged more than 90% this year.  Now, some of the lenders working with these already struggling bitcoin miners are in deeper trouble after getting caught up in the FTX blowup – potentially causing another major hit for the mining industry.  “ASIC financiers going through distress and bankruptcy will contribute to the cost of capital rising significantly in the space, and access to capital drying up,” said mining service firm Luxor’s chief operating officer, Ethan Vera, who also estimated the total debt of up to $2.5 billion outstanding for the miners.  If lenders go bankrupt, creditors are likely to try to liquidate some of the equipment loans, he said. In some cases, “it might be too difficult for a bankrupt company to continue to operate a loan book, in which case liquidating these existing loans will result in a significant haircut,” according to Vera.  Not many miners have direct exposure to FTX’s assets. However, the crypto exchange contributed to a $431 million funding round for miner Genesis Digital Assets (GDA) in September of last year.  The company’s spokesperson didn’t comment on FTX's investment but said GDA has no assets or accounts with FTX. Genesis Digital Assets is not related to CoinDesk’s sister company, Genesis Global.  Other key forms of exposures came from mining companies taking out large sums of loans from lenders such as BlockFi, Silvergate and Galaxy Digital, all of which have some exposure to Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF) exchange.  Still, considering that many miners are private and don’t share their debt obligations or exposure, the impact of the FTX implosion is uncertain. “We don’t know where all of the exposed counterparties are. And so for the industry, it’s really going to depend where new holes show up,” Jaime Leverton, CEO of Hut 8 (HUT), said during the firm’s third-quarter earnings call.  BlockFi  BlockFi became one of the many victims of FTX contagion and filed for bankruptcy protection in a federal court in New Jersey. The lender holds at least three mining machines-backed loans to publicly listed companies, crucially the $54 million that Core Scientific owes the lender. The miner, the U.S.’s biggest by computing power, is currently in talks to restructure its debt obligations that totaled about $244 million in loans and $597 in convertible and promissory notes at the end of the third quarter.  A Core Scientific spokesperson did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on this story.  Canadian miner Bitfarms (BITF) also borrowed $32 million from BlockFi, but only about $22 million of that is outstanding as of the end of September. Meanwhile, peer Cipher Mining (CIFR) secured a $46.9 credit facility for a joint venture with energy firm WindHQ, of which it owns 49%.  A Bitfarms spokesperson declined to comment on the story. The miner has been actively trying to reduce its leverage and said it paid down $27 million of bitcoin- and equipment-backed debt on Nov. 14.  Cipher CEO Tyler Page said the company had drawn about $26 million of the BlockFi facility and “never anticipated any further draws” after a second one made in August, so it isn’t concerned about BlockFi’s issue. Less than $10 million of that is outstanding, and the joint venture “continues to service the debt as expected,” Page said.  BlockFi and other lenders also hold undisclosed debt to privately held miners, which is hard to estimate due to non-disclosure agreements. BlockFi spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment on this story.  Silvergate Capital  Silvergate Capital, a digital assets bank and infrastructure provider, said that of its $11.9 billion in customer deposits, only 10% belongs to FTX and the bank has no outstanding loans related to FTX. The crypto bank also said that its BlockFi digital-asset deposit exposure totals less than $20 million.  One of the biggest publicly traded miners, Marathon Digital (MARA), has drawn $100 million in total, equally from two bitcoin-backed debt instruments that have a cap at $100 million each, said Marathon’s vice president of corporate communications, Charlie Schumacher. One is a term loan and the other is a revolving credit facility, both with Silvergate Capital.  As the news of FTX’s collapse started spreading and the price of bitcoin started to decline, Marathon had to post more collateral to back its dollar-denominated outstanding debt, Schumacher explained.  As of Nov. 9, only 1,950 BTC (about $30.6 million) of Marathon’s 11,440 BTC was unrestricted, meaning it can be used for business purposes, the firm said in its third-quarter earnings report. If bitcoin’s price declined further, Marathon would have to post more collateral, hence restricting more of its bitcoin holdings.  The mining firm has decided to reduce some of its obligations given the market uncertainty and volatility. “Given what's going on in the broader markets, we want to make sure that we have even more breathing room,” Schumacher said.  Galaxy Digital  Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital (GLXY) has $76.8 million of cash and digital assets tied to the exchange, the firm said in its third-quarter earnings report. Galaxy has been reported to be looking to cut nearly 62% of its exposure to FTX. Galaxy has also been active in lending to miners.  Bitfarms is one of the miners that secured a $100 million bitcoin-backed credit facility from Galaxy. However, after paying down parts of the loan and amending some of the terms, the outstanding balance is $23 million, at the end of the third quarter.  Galaxy’s exposure to FTX hasn’t impacted its services and offerings for clients and the company continues to take a “a prudent, risk-managed approach toward financing arrangements in the mining space,” said the firm’s head of communications, Mike Wursthorn.  Galaxy is not in distress but other players that took significantly larger exposures will likely have issues, according to Wursthorn. “We are focused on secondary activity of ASICs, both from direct miners as well as lenders, and are in a good position to provide liquidity at good values for that equipment,” he noted.  During the third quarter, the Galaxy mining arm closed three existing machine leases totaling about $8 million “at expected terms without defaults, delinquencies, or losses,” Wursthorn added.  The shares of Galaxy fell about 81% on the Toronto exchange this year.  Foundry  Crypto mining and staking firm, Foundry, has no direct exposure to FTX, but is indirectly tied to it through its sister company, Genesis Global, which is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group. Genesis said its derivatives business unit has about $175 million of funds locked into its FTX account. DCG granted a $140 million equity infusion to the trading firm.  A Greenidge spokesperson said it has an outstanding loan to Foundry, which is a “fraction” of the original amount, but said that its “risk management strategy of liquidating” bitcoin mining revenue and “and removing all funds from exchanges daily was specifically designed to prevent” exposure to exchanges.  Bitfarms owes just above $1.5 million to Foundry, as of Sept. 30.  Foundry declined to comment on this story.  Canadian miner Hut 8 (HUT) said it paid off its debt to Foundry earlier this year and never drew from a $50 million credit facility from Galaxy, according to Erin Dermer, Hut 8’s senior vice president of communications and culture.  Meanwhile, another crypto lender, NYDIG, said it has consistently passed on opportunities to invest in the likes of FTX. Similarly, financial firm BlockFills said that it has zero exposure to Genesis Global, BlockFi, FTX or Alameda Research.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/02/bitcoin-miners-ftx-contagion-exposure-may-amplify-industry-pain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2624c7c86adc9d2df7507e1e582d1d020733e156-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414803,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBLRXf,1669995764,Alameda Research Shouldered FTX Loss of Up to $1B Following Client's Leveraged Trade in 2021: FT,"Alameda Research bore the brunt of a $1 billion loss incurred by its affiliated firm FTX after a leveraged trade on the now-bankrupt crypto exchange backfired early last year, the Financial Times reported Friday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  In early 2021, a client's leveraged bet on a little-known token called mobilecoin – used for payments in the messaging app Signal – suddenly caused it to spike from to almost $70 from $6, exposing some weaknesses in FTX's financial buffers.  The trader used the position to borrow against it on FTX, which could have allowed him or her to extract dollars from the exchange, according to the FT's report.  Alameda, which was also owned by then-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, then stepped in to assume the trader's position to protect FTX's liquidity. Its loss was in the hundreds of millions of dollars and could have been as high as $1 billion.  The revelation reinforces the unusual ties between the two companies, as it was later discovered that FTX in turn bailed out Alameda with as much as $10 billion in user funds this year.  That FTX was having to navigate such losses in the pre-bear market days of 2021 may also go some way to explain its frail position that would ultimately bring about its collapse. Bankruptcy filings reveal that FTX and Alameda lost $3.7 billion in 2021.  FTX didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meta hopes for an eventual “interconnectability” between the different global jurisdictions that will be wrestling with rules for the metaverse economy, said Edward Bowles, the company’s head of fintech policy, so that someone in Meta's Horizon Worlds virtual-reality offering can pick up their assets and “move to another world seamlessly and back again.”  “We’re some way off from that being a reality, so these are very early days,” Bowles told reporters this week in Washington, calling this paper “just the beginning of a series of conversations”  The document outlines three priorities for the metaverse – an evolution of the internet that foresees users interacting in virtual-reality worlds. Eventual metaverse rules should take a technology-neutral stance, recognize the potential economic benefits in Web3 and insist that the governments and industry build it together, according to the paper. That cooperation would include the potential role of central bank digital currencies in the metaverse economy.  Three years ago, Meta’s Facebook sought to launch a global stablecoin, first known as libra, then diem. Regulators bristled at the bold initial approach by the company and its partners, and the initiative became seen as a threat of Big Tech’s potential dominance of the financial system.  Even Diem’s later, more careful approach met resistance, with government officials saying such an effort could explode in scale until it put the stability of the broader financial system at risk. The project was finally abandoned last year, and U.S. regulators have since clarified that they don’t want major corporations giving birth to their own stablecoins.  “Libra was a particular proposition in a particular time,” Bowles said. “We’ve moved on from that. This is a very different world that we’re in now.”  Meta’s all-in commitment to Horizon Worlds has been expensive. Facebook Reality Labs division has reported shrinking revenue and mounting losses in the billions of dollars every quarter.  “Skepticism doesn’t bother me too much,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at an event this week in New York.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/02/meta-dips-toe-back-into-policy-circles-to-boost-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35a5aef56e77b27a1fecec726afb10cfd4c1773e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but Galaxy spokesman Michael Wursthornsaid the price was materially less than what Celsius paid a year ago. Celsius acquired GK8 in November 2021 for $115 million, as reported.  Bloomberg reported earlier on the Galaxy-GK8 deal.  Galaxy's aim with the acquisition is to expand its prime brokerage offering. Around 40 people would be joining Galaxy's team, including blockchain engineers and cryptographers.  The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would expand Galaxy's global footprint with a new office in Tel Aviv, Israel, the firm said.  ""Adding GK8 to our prime offering at this pivotal moment for our industry also highlights our continued willingness to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow Galaxy in a sustainable manner,"" Novogratz, who is the founder and CEO of Galaxy, said in the release.

The successor, Luna Classic (LUNC), currently once again surged in price. LUNC briefly rose to $0.00019439, registering a 20% price increase. At press time, the LUNC price showed a correction. However, LUNC was still at $0.00018 and showed a price increase of 11% over the last 24 hours. The background for the sudden pump was the fact that Binance destroyed more than 6 billion LUNC in the sixth batch of the Terra Classic token burn on Thursday. Binance sent $1 million worth of LUNC tokens to a dead address, wiping out 12.77 million LUNC. With the current token burn, Binance has now destroyed nearly 20 billion LUNC tokens. 🔥 Burn alert! 6,389,199,628 #LUNC ($1,038,309) burned to Luna Burn Wallet! https://t.co/Z6PZLanME4 #LunaBurn #BurnLuna — LunaBurnTracker (@LunaBurnTracker) December 1, 2022 The leading crypto exchange introduced the Terra Classic (LUNC) burn mechanism for trading fees in September this year. It was a response to a LUNC community proposal. All trading fees for LUNC spot and margin trading pairs are burned by Binance by sending them to the LUNC burn address. The specific amount of LUNC burned and the on-chain transaction ID are published each month. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin (BTC) See A Christmas Rally? Here’s What To Watch With the token burn, the LUNC community aims to make the token deflationary by destroying tokens and thus reducing the overall supply. According to the supply/demand theory, an increase in value occurs when the supply decreases and the tokens become rarer. For the moment, this seems to work quite well as LUNC has seen green daily candles on most occasions when the burn took place. Terra Co-Founder Facing Arrest In South Korea? In other Terra ecosystem news, Terraform Labs Pte. Ltd. co-founder Shin Hyun-Seung, also known as Daniel Shin, and seven other Terra employees are facing a court hearing in South Korea today. The hearing from South Korean prosecutors is for the issuance of an arrest warrant for the eight individuals. To that end, hearings began today for Shin and the other Terra employees. According to the Korea Times, Shin is accused of making illicit profits of over 140 billion Korean won, the equivalent of about $107 million, from the cryptocurrency LUNA. He is accused of promoting the Terra stablecoin as a payment method despite multiple warnings from regulators and misusing the private data of Chai Corporation users to promote Terra Luna. South Korean prosecutors accuse Shin and his partners of violating the Capital Markets Act and the Electronic Financial Transactions Act, as well as dereliction of duty. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Starts Technical Correction, Here’s Key Support To Watch Shin denies the charges, claiming that he sold over 70% of his LUNA holdings before the price spike.

""Initial analysis is developer private key was hacked, and the hacker updated the smart contract to a more malicious one,"" Changpeng Zhao explained, adding that Binance froze about $3M that hackers moved to its centralized exchange (CEX). Ankr said it told decentralized exchanges (DEXes) to block trading and noted it will re-issue tokens after the exploit has been assessed. ANKR tokens slipped 3.4% to two cents in Friday morning trading, down from its April peak of around $0.18.

42414811,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBLRst,1669988046,Bitcoin Slips as US Economy Added a Strong 263K Jobs in November,"Employers added 263,000 jobs in November, down from an upwardly revised 284,000 in October but topping expectations of 200,000 as the U.S. economy continues to show signs of strength. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7%, in line with expectations.  Bitcoin (BTC) has slipped by about $200 on the news to $16,830. The monthly employment report has become key for traders as it influences the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, with higher interest rates this year among the factors behind the crypto bear market.  Checking traditional markets, Nasdaq futures have tumbled nearly 2% following the strong data and the 10-year Treasury yield has jumped 9 basis points to 3.6%.  In 2022 the Fed lifted its benchmark fed funds rate from near zero to a range of 3.75% to 4%. The central bank is expected to approve another rate hike at the next meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Dec. 13-14, taking the range up to 4.25%-4.5%. Index swaps are now pricing in a terminal fed funds rate of 4.95%, up from 4.6% a day ago.  “The labor market, which is especially important for inflation … shows only tentative signs of rebalancing and wage growth remains well above levels that were consistent with 2% inflation over time,” Fed Chair Jay Powell said during an event at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. “So despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.”  Powell both previously and again on Wednesday strongly hinted there would be slowing of the pace of rate hikes from 75 basis points to 50 basis points this month. Futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) had priced in an 81% chance of a 50 basis point move. In the minutes following Friday’s jobs report, that percentage was 77%.  “Given our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level,” Powell said in his Wednesday remarks. “It seems to me likely that the ultimate level of rates will need to be somewhat higher than thought at the time of the September meeting.”  UPDATE (Dec. 2, 13:56): Adds additional reporting.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/02/bitcoin-as-us-economy-added-jobs-in-november,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66170777f8da81e3c2b55dcd2228bee0cd15a65f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414815,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBLSJQ,1669987545,How Attackers Made $15M From Staking Platform Helio After Ankr Exploit,"An unknown group of attackers were able to drain some $15 million in liquidity from BNB Chain-based staking platform Helio on Friday morning after exploiting an oracle issue on the protocol, on-chain data shows.  Oracles are third-party services that fetch data from outside sources to within a certain blockchain. Oracles are extensively used by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to ensure their lending, borrowing and other services are accurate. Delays, however, could mean the loss of funds as malicious traders take advantage of price differences.  The Helio exploit came hours after the DeFi Ankr was attacked for $5 million. The Ankr attacker was able to mint 6 quadrillion aBNBc tokens, which they eventually turned into roughly 5 million USDC, as CoinDesk reported.  The Ankr exploit caused the prices of aBNBc tokens to plunge 99% in the minutes following the attack, setting the base for the second exploit on Helio. It is unclear at writing time if both the attacks were conducted by the same attacker or group of attackers.  Blockchain data shows that the Helio attacker acquired some 183,000 aBNBc tokens with 10 BNB during Asian morning hours on Friday. Delayed oracle data on Helio then allowed the attacker to borrow $16 million worth of HAY stablecoin.  The illicitly gained HAY was then swapped for 15 million Binance USD (BUSD), blockchain data cited by security firms BlockSec and PeckShield shows.  The HAY staking pool continues to hold some $19 million in locked funds, with developers stating in European afternoon hours that staked funds remained safe. Helio said in a separate tweet that it was working to mitigate the ongoing situation and asked users to avoid transacting in HAY.  Meanwhile, Binance froze some $3 million linked to the attack that were allegedly moved by the attackers to the exchange, founder Changpeng Zhao said in a Friday tweet.

The U.S. employment report for November is expected to show a sizable slowdown in hiring, but the labor market remains too tight, according to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Ether was climbing ahead of the report, up slightly on the day.  Derivatives marketplace Chicago Mercantile Exchange and cryptocurrency index provider CF Benchmarks this month will introduce reference ratesand real-time indexes for aave (AAVE), curve (CRV) and aynthetix (SNX). The new rates will be calculated and published starting on Dec. 19. They aren’t tradable futures products now.  Binance’s chief strategy officer said the company's centralized exchange may not exist in 10 years because the crypto market is moving toward decentralized finance. For now, the exchange is trying to keep customers' trust after the collapse of rival exchange FTX by implementing ""proof of reserves,"" which is a way to show customers that their assets are fully backed by liquid assets.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows a renewed uptick in the U.S. consumer inflation expectations tracked by the Conference Board and University of Michigan.  The data suggests the consumer price index may moderate slower than markets anticipate, delaying the potential Federal Reserve pivot away from liquidity tightening.  Risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, have taken a beating this year predominantly because of the Fed's liquidity tightening.

The DOJ, which was already looking into the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried's global crypto enterprise, now wants a bankruptcy court to appoint an independent examiner to probe potential wrongdoing that may have led to the collapse, which ended in a bankruptcy filing on Nov. 11.  ""An examiner could – and should – investigate the substantial and serious allegations of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct and mismanagement by the Debtors,"" DOJ Trustee Andrew R. Vara said in the filing, which sought a court order approving a neutral examination.  In the same filing, the FTX collapse was described as the ""fastest big corporate failure in American history.""  There is a substantial basis to believe that CEO Bankman-Fried – who has since been replaced by John Jay Ray III – along with other managers ""mismanaged"" the company ""or engaged in fraudulent conduct,"" and the court should approve the appointment of an independent examiner, Vara said.  Following the rapid collapse of FTX, which closely followed a CoinDesk article that scrutinized its financials, lawyers began to question if the exchange had engaged in fraudulent activity by misusing customer funds. Shortly after he took over, new FTX CEO Ray said in court filings that the company had concealed the misuse of corporate funds, which included the purchase of property in the Bahamas for staff.  ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,"" Ray said in the filing.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and attorneys from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement division have sent requests for information to crypto investors and trading firms that worked with FTX, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.  An examination would be preferred to an investigation because the former can be made public, which ""is especially important because of the wider implications that FTX’s collapse may have for the crypto industry,"" Vara said in the filing.

5048952,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510868,1669978915,Will Bitcoin (BTC) See A Christmas Rally? Here’s What To Watch,"After the recent speech by US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, there was a price firework on the stock market, from which Bitcoin also benefited. As a result, the BTC price has climbed to over $17,000. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $16,982. However, the joy could not last long. The price is currently just bobbing along at the level reached. In the meantime, there are even signs of a slight downward trend again. In the 1-hour chart, investors should keep an eye on four levels. A fall below $16,727 could mean an erosion of the recent Powell gains. On the other side, a rise above the $17,250 level would clear the path towards the $17,800-$18,000 area. Did The Market Misinterpret Powell? The reaction of the Bitcoin market is actually also logical. Since the last meeting, Fed officials have repeatedly defended the restrictive monetary policy and demanded its continuation. That Powell now said that “the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting” was a surprise. Still, the market overheard the hawkish comments. Thus, Powell also said that the fight against inflation is far from over. Therefore, he said, the Fed must keep its policy at restrictive levels “for some time.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Starts Technical Correction, Here’s Key Support To Watch Powell also was tired of emphasizing that the Fed still has a long way to go to bring inflation down and that they probably need “somewhat higher” interest rates than expected in the September projections. Gold bug Peter Schiff commented: Investors are no longer buying what Powell is selling. Today he was as hawkish as ever, but the dollar tanked, and gold & stocks rallied. Powell’s resolve to fight #inflation is contingent on a soft landing. Not only will the economy crash, it’ll be another financial crisis. Bitcoin Faces Headwinds In December Whether there will be a Christmas rally in December is likely to depend on various factors that will confront Bitcoin with serious headwinds. First and foremost, the Fed meeting on December 14 and the release of the new CPI data a day earlier are likely to be key in determining whether there will be a green or red Christmas. Related Reading: US Institutional Investors Flocking Back To Bitcoin – Is The Bottom In? In addition, Bitcoin investors should keep an eye on further FTX contagion effects, especially Genesis Trading and DCG. If DCG indeed only has a liquidity issue and can solve it, it would be a major relief for the crypto market. Also, recession fears are growing, but could take a back seat for the time being if inflation continues to fall and the Fed announces a 50 bps rate hike. Potentially, this would be solid fuel for a strong year-end rally. With miner capitulation currently looming, Bitcoin could be entering the closing stages of its bear market. The historical average duration is 14 months. Currently, we are in the 13th month. A Glimpse Beyond December – Bitcoin’s First Recession? Not only Peter Schiff, but also other analysts are still warning of an looming recession, even though Powell still called a soft landing “very plausible” during his last speech. The fact that the full impact of the Fed’s policy will not become apparent until 2023 is also supported by the fact that Q4 earnings results, which are due at the end of January, are always the strongest of the year. Thus, a recession might not become apparent until April 2023, when Q1 2023 earnings are announced. A CryptoQuant verified analyst noted that the 2YR-10YR yield curve has the steepest inversion since the 2000s (dot com bubble).

5048843,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510877,1669978673,Chainlink May Rise 25% This Week As Bulls Work To Reclaim Its Pre-Crash Value,"The use of the native token of Chainlink is seeing a decent rise. Today alone, the price of LINK has increased by 2.0% in the last 24 hours, as measured by statistics from CoinGecko. Though not a big deal in terms of massive increases, it pumps up the bulls. In the weekly and bi-weekly timescale, the token shot up to 11.6% and 22.4% respectively. Meanwhile, let’s take a quick look at how the token has been performing: The Proof-of-Reserve mechanism used by Chainlink is open and trustworthy, which encourages investment CoinGecko has observed a surge in price, an indication of rising investor interest Negative confirmation delays any decline, while positive indicators and investor optimism ease the breach at $7.808 barrier Related Reading: Tron Adds 1.75 Million New Addresses In Last 7 Days As TRX Regains Previous Losses This price movement made by LINK is just after BTC’s pullback. Not to mention that Chainlink’s official Twitter released its own version of a Proof-of-Reserve system. According to the Tweet, this transparent system will satisfy the demands of consumers, especially after FTX’s mismanagement of user funds that resulted in the downfall of the crypto exchange. Investor Confidence Needs Boost? With investor confidence low, the price increase can be explained by the recent rise in BTC and the introduction of Chainlink’s POR system. As of this writing, the correlation between Bitcoin and LINK is 0.82. However, the token’s price may experience a period of correction if the trust boost that prompted the recent price surge is reversed. Chart: TradingView As the time of writing, the current market pullback experienced rejection at the $7.80 level, but investor confidence must be high as CryptoQuant noted a decrease in exchange reserves. Messari demonstrates that LINK’s indicators reflect an upward price trend. Sharpe’s ratio is 0.68, suggesting that the asset is lucrative despite its inherent risk. LINK is currently trading at $7.60, up 11.4 percent in the last seven days, data from Coingecko show. But can LINK maintain its current momentum? It appears that it can. Daily RSI values are increasing, indicating a protracted and sustained bullish trend in the intermediate and long-term. The middle Bollinger band confirms this momentum, as it supports the price movement. Connecting The Dots However, CMF is currently -0.13, indicating that the market mood is still pessimistic. Previous price fluctuations also signal a demand block that might support a more robust bull run. In the next days or weeks, the price of the Chainlink token is expected to rise. Chainlink is seen making a 25% rally this week, as Bulls work to recover the token’s recent losses. If the ascending triangle reinforces the rejection at $7.808, bulls can attempt to retarget this level from the current rally’s support level of $6.709. Once a breakthrough occurs on the rejection, it will be easier to target LINK’s price prior to the FTX crash.

This is the first time Trader Joe will be deployed on a separate network.  Trader Joe will initially be deployed on the Arbitrum testnet in the coming days with the mainnet launch expected in early 2023. The DEX captured $2.5 billion in locked value at its lifetime peak and continues to attract the highest transactional volumes among all Avalanche-based products.  Trader Joe’s Liquidity Book AMM – a product that claims to make DEX trading more efficient – will be rolled out in the initial launch. The DEX’s native JOE token or the full suite of DeFi products, such as lending and staking services, will not be available on Arbitrum.  Why Arbitrum?  As previously reported, crypto traders and investors are increasingly seeing the Arbitrum ecosystem as a likely spot for capturing returns along the lines of the 100-times-plus multiples sometimes witnessed in prior bull-market cycles.  The Ethereum-based scaling product, which allows traders to transact on the blockchain network for under a few cents in fees and transacting times of a few seconds, is among a flurry of blockchain networks that launched in the past year – each promising to be faster and cheaper than the previous one.  On-chain data shows Arbitrum is not all hype. Since August, weekly transactions on Arbitrum have skyrocketed over 550%, with the Arbitrum network now commanding more than 62% of the weekly transactions on Ethereum.  The total value locked (TVL) on Arbitrum has increased by over $300 million in the past few months, data from DeFiLlama shows, with the ecosystem now holding just under $1 billion.

Meme cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) has rallied 40% in the past 10 days, outpacing the 18% gain in ether (ETH) and bitcoin's 8% rise. Total market capitalization has increased by 10% to $808 billion, CoinDesk data shows.  The discrepancy is significant because, historically, outsized gains in DOGE and other meme coins like shiba inu (SHIB) have portended a market-wide sell-off.  ""Every time that [the] price of DOGE starts rising rapidly, there's a market-wide crash following just moments later,"" blockchain analytics firm Santiment said in a market insights note. ""Right now, we are observing such a rise. Now the question is, is this time different?""  The chart shows rallies in DOGE, which started as a joke in 2013, have evolved into contrarian indicators in the past 12 months, prompting investors to trim bullish positioning in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The most notable example would be DOGE's late October surge that foreshadowed bitcoin's FTX-induced slide to 24-month lows in mid-November.

According to data provided by Coingecko, from its $0.064 price on November 6, TRX went on a steady decline until it plummeted to $0.046 on November 14. After that, the cryptocurrency managed to stage a rebound and continues to do a relatively good job at recovering its losses. In fact, at the time of this writing, TRON has managed to tally a 19% jump from its November low, trading at $0.054. Over the last two weeks, the digital asset seems to have found its groove as it continues to shake off the negative effects of both the crypto winter and the FTX collapse. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Usher In December Near $18,000 If It Moves Past This Resistance Tron Report Reveals Project Capable of Attracting More Users As another week came to a close, Tron blockchain, via Twitter, shared some important data pertaining to its performance for its community. According to TRON DAO’s post, the project managed to add 1.75 million new addresses within the last seven days, pushing its total tally to 123.3 million accounts. 📢#TRON Weekly Report 11.21 – 11.27 ✅#TRON blockchain height exceeded 46.23 million. ✅The total number of accounts on #TRON reached 123,377,790. ✅The total number of transactions on #TRON reached 4.28 billion. ✅The #TVL on #TRON reached $9.4 billion.https://t.co/29s3o8NKuH — TRON DAO (@trondao) November 30, 2022 Also, during the same period, the total number of transactions facilitated on the blockchain network reached 4.28 billion. In terms of total value locked (TVL), from November 21 to 27, the project was able to hit the $9.4 billion mark after registering an increase of roughly $400 million. Meanwhile, the Tron blockchain height surpassed 46.23 million during the same timeframe. The data, according to Tron, seems to prove that given the right conditions, the project is capable of enticing millions of new users to join its ecosystem. It also indicates there are still many individuals that believe in the blockchain’s potential. 3 Main Problems TRX Is Facing Although it is hovering around the $0.054 at the moment, TRON is not yet out of the woods as there are still challenges that could cause it to plummet once again. According to some experts, the cryptocurrency is left to deal with the fact that many people lost their faith in the digital asset class following the collapse of the FTX exchange platform which filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on November 11. TRX is also facing fierce competition from projects such as BitGert (BRISE) and Centrex (CENX) which are, according to experts, having better adoption numbers when compared to the Tron token. Finally, within the last few weeks, there has been an apparent instability within Tron network as investors panicked when USDD (the project’s algorithmic stablecoin) lost its peg to the US dollar. These could trigger another price dump for the crypto asset, therefore investors and prospective buyers are advised to keep an eye on these to help them with their decision making.

According to data from Coingecko, on November 29, the asset went up by 13% and peaked at $7.22 before entering a correction phase that made it return to the $6 territory. At the time of this writing, tracking from the online crypto information provider indicates the token is changing hands at $6.63, declining by 2.9% during the previous 24 hours. Still, the altcoin is sitting on a 20% gain over the last seven days and has tallied an impressive 44.3% jump for the past two weeks. This momentary surge of the Huobi Token might have been triggered by news of plans to launch a new crypto project. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Continues To Impress With 25% Rally In Last Seven Days Sun Teases Debut Of Dominica Currency (DMC) Using his Twitter account, Sun – who was recently appointed by Huobi to be a member of a new global advisory board – announced the launch of the Dominica coin. The exchange platform confirmed this development with an official statement, saying that the soon-to-be-released digital asset, which will be called Dominica Currency (DMC), will be introduced to the public via the Huobi Prime – the company’s only platform for token offerings. There was no definite timeline mentioned as to when the new crypto will be available but the Bitcoin exchange said it will be airdropped to their users. Along this line, Huobi also said that their users can use their Dominica digital identification documents (DID) to confirm their identities in preparation for the airdrop. This is not the first time that the Commonwealth of Dominica, an island country in the Caribbean, advanced its crypto adoption programs as it has already made TRON and its associated native tokens legal tender within its jurisdictions. As Island Nation Anticipates, Interest For Upcoming Project Grows Although there is no clear timetable for the expected airdrop of Dominica Currency, the excitement for it is undeniable as it comes with a utility feature that is sorely lacking for many cryptocurrencies out there right now. For its part, the Huobi Token is expected to play a vital role for the good performance and overall success of the DMC that is pivotal in giving holders greater chances for higher return on their investments. With this development, HT managed to surge in value. Moreover, its technical indicators are pointing at a further climb, although the volatility of the market can once again obliterate all its recent gains.

42413532,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9ddy,1669961291,DeFi Protocol Ankr to Reimburse Users Affected by $5M Exploit,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ankr said it will reimburse the users impacted by the $5 million exploit that occurred on its platform earlier Friday.  ""We will take a snapshot and reissue ankrBNB to all valid aBNBc holders before the exploit. The ankrBNB token will continue to be redeemable, while aBNBc and aBNBb will no longer be redeemable,"" Ankr said in a tweet after the exploit.  Ankr, which called itself the first ""node-as-a-service"" platform, had suffered the multimillion-dollar exploit due to a bug in its code that allowed for unlimited minting of its token.  After minting the quadrillions of aBNBc token, the attacker was able to swap 20 trillion of them for BNB, then move those to crypto mixer Tornado Cash. The attacker then swapped the BNB tokens for 5 million USDC.  Because the hacker almost completely drained the aBNBc liquidity pools on PancakeSwap and ApeSwap, the token lost nearly 99% of its value, according to CoinGecko data.  According to security research firm PeckShield, the code behind the Ankr contract allows any user to mint an unlimited amount of the protocol’s reward-bearing staking tokens without any sort of verification. This allowed the attacker to mint six quadrillion of the aBNBc token.  Ankr tweeted that all staked assets within the protocol are currently safe. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that his exchange had frozen $3 million that had been sent to his exchange by the hackers.  Secondary exploit  On-chain analyst firm Lookonchain reported that one opportunistic trader was able to cash in on the exploit and turn 10 BNB ($2,885) into 15.5 million BUSD. The trader did this by taking advantage of DeFi lending protocol Helio, which did not have up-to-date pricing on aBNBc post-crash.  The trader was also able to use the pre-crash pricing for aBNBc to borrow $16 million of the little-traded HAY stablecoin and convert that into BUSD. Since then, the HAY stablecoin has been tossed off its peg, hitting a low of 20 cents, and is now recovering, according to CoinMarketCap, with a price of 77 cents.

Besides, there was a break below a major bullish trend line with support near $1,280 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair is still trading above $1,250 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,290 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,300 level. A close above the $1,300 resistance might send the price further higher. The next major resistance is near the $1,350 level, above which ether price might test $1,400. If the bulls remain in action above $1,400, the price could rise towards the $1,450 resistance zone. Any more gains might send the price towards the $1,500 resistance zone. Dips Supported in ETH? If ethereum fails to start another increase above the $1,300 resistance, it could start a downside correction. An initial support on the downside is near the $1,250 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The next major support is near the $1,230 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,150 swing low to $1,309 high. If there is a break below $1,230, the price could test the $1,180 support. Any more losses could lead the price towards the $1,150 support.

42413514,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9dP0,1669942367,First Mover Asia: Cryptos' Short Win Streak Ends as Investors Remain Cautious,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether traded down slightly to break a three-day streak of gains, although the largest crypto by market value continued to change hands near $17,000.  Insights: An IEO at crypto exchange Binance shows that many investors remain high on cryptocurrencies, despite the ongoing bear market.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 865.08 −10.4 ▼ 1.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,984 −185.3 ▼ 1.1% Ethereum (ETH) $1,279 −10.1 ▼ 0.8% S&P 500 daily close  4,076.57 −3.5 ▼ 0.1% Gold  $1,815 +68.5 ▲ 3.9% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.53% ▼ 0.2 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin's Short Winning Streak Ends  By James Rubin  Crypto prices, which had been rolling this week, retreated on Thursday, underscoring investors' caution about the industry's fate, and the wider economy.  Bitcoin was recently trading just below $17,000, off 0.8% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had risen three consecutive days amid encouraging jobs and productivity data and hopes that the U.S. central bank was ready to scale back its hawkish monetary policy. On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had suggested in a speech at the Brookings Institute that the Fed might raise interest rates 50 basis points, down from its recent 75 basis points regimen.  But in the 36 hours since Powell's remarks, cryptos have been largely unimpressed by the prospect of increased liquidity and more concerned about contagion linked to crypto exchange giant FTX's collapse, not to mention other 2022 debacles still winding their way through courts.  ""Cryptos are struggling,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, in an email. ""Concerns brew that Tether loans could be the next big risk for the cryptoverse. Stablecoins are an important part of the crypto world and if one of the major ones break, that will send bitcoin and [ether] to new lows.""  Ether was holding steady at slightly under $1,300, down 1.2%. Other major cryptos were largely in the red, albeit lightly shaded, although popular meme coin DOGE recently dropped more than 4%. DOGE had climbed about 50% over an eight-day stretch starting Nov. 22. MATIC, the token of the layer 2 Polygon blockchain platform, was down more than 2% after rising the past couple of days at least partly on news that its application programming interface (APIs) would soon deploy on web3 indexing service, The Graph.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, slipped 1.26%.  Cryptos' day largely dovetailed with stocks' sluggish day as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 declined a few fractions of a percentage point. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose slightly.  Moya noted that investors – crypto and otherwise – would be awaiting the release of nonfarm payroll data for the latest read on the U.S. job market, which has shown signs of cooling over the last few months. In November, private companies added only 127,000 jobs, according to payroll processor ADP, less than half the number in October.  Meanwhile, Pranav Kanade, portfolio manager for mutual fund and exchange-traded fund company VanEck, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program on Wednesday that predicting where crypto prices bottom out would be difficult, although he struck an upbeat note about recent industry crises and market bearishness.  ""When we look at one of the positives coming out of what just happened, you have seen a lot of investors withdraw assets into self-custody,"" he said, adding: ""My guess is that anyone who's remaining in the ecosystem are likely true believers in the underlying technology and even the future upside of the asset class.""

Depending where you look, the crypto dream is thriving.  A recently concluded initial exchange offering (IEO) at crypto exchange Binance saw participants lock up over 9 million BNB, valued at over $2.7 billion, as they competed for the allocation of Hooked Protocol’s HOOK tokens.  The IEO, a fundraising event administered by an exchange, comes as crypto markets weather a year-long bear market that has been exacerbated by the implosion of multiple major projects, most recently crypto exchange giant FTX. Some tokens have lost as much as 95% of their value amid the contagion, and bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has plunged more than 60%.  IEOs usually see users lock up a certain amount of that exchange’s native tokens for allocation in another token that would soon be traded on that exchange.  A total of 114,772 participants committed 9,010,765.2954 BNB during the subscription period, representing an oversubscription of 1,066x. Users would receive 139.44 HOOK to 13,944 HOOK based on the BNB they lock up. The BNB would be returned to users after HOOK is distributed – minus a predetermined fixed amount ranging from 0.4 BNB to 4 BNB.  Hooked Protocol builds the on-ramp layer for Web3 applications and bespoke ""learn and earn"" products. HOOK is the governance token of the ecosystem, and is used to access community events and exclusive NFTs, and for in-app purchases, including game tools, for dapps built on Hooked.  Hooked Protocol has raised over $6 million from two rounds of private token sales earlier this year and has a current valuation of $60 million. The total supply of HOOK is 500 million and the circulating supply upon listing will be 50 million.

On multiple occasions, SBF stated that he made financial decisions with little or no aversion to risk. We're all entitled to our own risk preferences, but our risk preferences have consequences if we act consistently with them. In the case of SBF, his risk preferences made it almost certain that he'd go bust, and quickly. There's much that's being written about Sam Bankman-Fried [SBF] and the choices he made at FTX (FTT-USD). We think there's one particular aspect of his thinking and actions that has received less attention than it deserves, and perhaps explains better than anything else the arc of his narrative. 1 In a range of interviews and Twitter threads (see links and excerpts below), SBF explained that he approached financial decisions with little or no aversion to risk. That's a valid personal choice, but it's highly unusual. In our own experience, we've never met anyone who made important financial decisions consistent with being anywhere in the ballpark of zero risk aversion. To see why, it's helpful to take a look at where risk-aversion comes from. It arises from the fact that most people derive less and less incremental satisfaction from progressive increases in wealth – or, as economists like to say: most people exhibit diminishing marginal utility of wealth. This naturally leads to risk aversion because a loss hurts more than the equivalent gain feels good. The classic Theory of Choice Under Uncertainty recommends making decisions that maximize Expected Utility, which is the probability-weighted average of all possible utility outcomes. SBF explained on multiple occasions that his level of risk-aversion was so low that he didn't need to think about maximizing Expected Utility, but could instead just make his decisions based on maximizing the Expected Value of his wealth directly. So what does this mean in practice? Let's say you find an investment which has a 1% chance of a 10,000x payoff, but a 99% chance of winding up worth zero. It has a very high expected return, but it's also very risky. 2 How much of your total wealth would you want to invest in it? 3 There's no right or wrong answer; it's down to your own personal preferences. However, we think most affluent people would invest somewhere between 0.1% and 1% of their wealth in this investment, based on observing other risky choices such people make and surveys we've conducted. We suspect that range sounds reasonable to you. 4 SBF on the other hand, making his decision strictly according to his stated preferences, would choose to invest 100% of his wealth in this investment, because it maximizes the Expected Value of his wealth. In one of his interviews, he did suggest that perhaps he wouldn't go all the way to 100%, but that he'd still invest way, way more than the typical choice of 0.1% to 1%. However, in other interviews, he didn't back off of the implications of maximizing Expected Value – as in, for example, his conversation with the economist Tyler Cowen (March 9, 2022). Tyler Cowen ((TC)): Should a Benthamite 5 be risk-neutral with regard to social welfare? SBF: Yes, that I feel very strongly about. TC: Ok, but let's say there's a game: 51% [chance] you double the Earth out somewhere else, 49% it all disappears. And would you keep on playing that game, double or nothing? SBF: Yeah…take the pure hypothetical… yeah. TC: So then you keep on playing the game. What's the chance we're left with anything? Don't I just St. Petersburg Paradox 6 you into non-existence? SBF: No, not necessarily – maybe [we're] St. Petersburg paradox-ed [sic] into an enormously valuable existence. That's the other option. We're all entitled to our own preferences, but our preferences have consequences – and there's a lot of evidence, both philosophical and practical, that when SBF's stated preferences encounter the real world, it results in almost surely going bust at some point, and pretty quickly for someone who knows their way around financial markets. Such a person won't have to search for special investment opportunities, like doing leveraged crypto arbitrage or founding a crypto exchange, to find risks that have positive expected value with low probabilities of big payoffs. For example, most would agree that the stock market has a positive expected return in excess of the risk-free rate. If out-of-the-money call options are fairly priced, repeatedly buying them would give the Expected Value maximizer ample opportunity to lose all their wealth in short order, offset by a vanishingly small chance of becoming the richest person in the world. Below are a few examples of SBF laying out his decision-making framework. Interview with Jacob Goldstein on What's Your Problem (YouTube channel), May 24, 2022: Jacob Goldstein: I'm Jacob Goldstein and this is What's Your Problem… My guest today is Sam Bankman-Fried and his problem is this: how do you save the world? Before we get to the interview, I just want to take a minute here and set up this one big idea, this really useful intellectual framework that drives almost everything Sam does. It's called Expected Value. SBF: I try to use it a lot because I think it sort of is the default correct way in some senses to calculate something. Like, if you're just trying to do a generic calculation I think it's usually the right thing to use… One of the sort of takeaways that often ends up coming from really thinking hard and critically about Expected Values is that you should go for it way more than is generally understood. JG: Go big. You should really go really big, even if you probably will fail and wind up with zero. SBF: That's absolutely right… if you really do care linearly about money, if you really do think that getting that marginal you know dollars worth a lot – um, you know, even once you already have a lot of money, um then, it – it should lead you to think that… And so, anytime that, like, there is some non-zero and non-negligible chance of a really really good outcome are times when you're gonna be incentivized more than seems natural probably to choose extreme outcomes. Conversation with Rob Wiblin on the 80,000 Hours podcast, April 14, 2022: SBF: Yeah. I think the way I saw it was like, let's maximize EV: whatever is the highest net expected value thing is what we should do. As opposed to some super sublinear utility function, which is like, make sure that you continue on a moderately good path above all else, and then anything beyond that is gravy. If you really are trying to maximize your impact, then at what point do you start hitting decreasing marginal returns? Well, in terms of doing good, there's no such thing: more good is more good. It's not like you did some good, so good doesn't matter anymore… That means that you should be pretty aggressive with what you're doing, and really trying to hit home runs rather than just have some impact – because the upside is just absolutely enormous. Better is Bigger, SBF Twitter Thread. 11:19 PM · Dec 10, 2020, @SBF_FTX SBF: …What about a wackier bet? How about you only win 10% of the time, but if you do you get paid out 10,000x your bet size? [So, if you have $100k,] Kelly suggests you only bet $10k: you'll almost certainly lose. And if you kept doing this much more than $10k at a time, you'd probably blow out. …this bet is great Expected Value; you win [more precisely, your Expected Value is] 1,000x your bet size. …In many cases I think $10k is a reasonable bet. But I, personally, would do more. I'd probably do more like $50k. Why? Because ultimately my utility function isn't really logarithmic. It's closer to linear. …Kelly tells you that when the backdrop is trillions of dollars, there's essentially no risk aversion on the scale of thousands or millions. Put another way: if you're maximizing EV(log(W+$1,000,000,000,000)) and W is much less than a trillion, this is very similar to just maximizing EV((W)). Does this mean you should be willing to accept a significant chance of failing to do much good sometimes? Yes, it does. And that's ok. If it was the right play in EV, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. It seems like SBF was essentially telling anyone who was listening that he'd either wind up with all the money in the world, which he'd then redistribute according to his Effective Altruist principles – or, much more likely, he'd die trying. Thank you to Rich Dewey, Antti Ilmanen, John Karubian and Jeff Rosenbluth for their help with this article. For a deeper dive, read this excellent article by Byrne Hobart at The Diff. This article is all about SBF applying his personal risk preferences with respect to his own money. We don't know yet the facts of what actually happened, but nothing we discuss herein justifies any improper use of client or investor money. Its standard deviation, a conventional measure of risk used for more symmetric payoff outcomes, is about ten times bigger than the expected return of the investment. Hence, its Sharpe Ratio is just 0.1 – not particularly high – although we emphasize that these conventional metrics of risk, return and quality of investment are not designed for evaluating investments such as these. For the purpose of this thought experiment, assume that all of your wealth is financial wealth and that you are considering this as a one-time investment in isolation of other opportunities. But if it doesn't, just consider what it would mean to bet, say, 20% of your wealth on such an opportunity multiple times. After twenty such investments, you'd have an 82% chance of having lost 99% of your wealth, and just an 18% chance of having won at least once. We think most people wouldn't find that distribution of outcomes very attractive. A Benthamite Utilitarian. Sadly, there is much confusion between “utility” in the Benthamite Utilitarianism SBF has discussed a fair amount with respect to social-welfare choices, and “utility” as a tool for financial decision-making in classical economics and the Decision-Making Under Uncertainty context. These are really disparate ideas, but various issues with Benthamite Utility have (unfairly) tainted von Neumann-Morgenstern Expected Utility.
