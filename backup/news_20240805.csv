32036517,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633257,1722897007,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: What Lies On The Horizon After Crashing Below $50,000","The cryptocurrency market has been rocked by a massive sell-off, with the Bitcoin price plunging 26% from its July highs above $70,000. This dramatic decline comes amid a broader crash in global financial markets, reflecting growing economic uncertainty and investor risk aversion. Crypto Winter Returns? The crypto sphere was not spared from this turbulence, as risk aversion sentiments reverberated across the industry on Monday. Bitcoin witnessed a staggering 16% decline, reaching as low as $48,860 on Binance, while Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced its most substantial fall since 2021, reaching $2,116. Related Reading: Chainlink: Market Panic Shaves 23% Off LINK Price – Details Notably, the fallout extended to crypto-related stocks, with crypto companies such as Coinbase Global, MicroStrategy, miners Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms also seeing significant drops in their share values. As concerns about the economic outlook intensified amid a global equity sell-off, concerns about the efficacy of heavy investment in artificial intelligence (AI) added to market unease. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East further added an additional layer of uncertainty and contributed to investor anxiety. Bitcoin Price Predicted To Hit $15,000 The past 24 hours witnessed a total liquidation of approximately $1.2 billion in crypto bets, marking one of the most significant liquidations since early March. Factors such as the unwinding yen carry trade and adjustments to higher interest rates in Japan played a role in this market upheaval. Despite the current crash, some experts remain bearish on the crypto market’s long-term prospects. Justin Bennett, a crypto analyst, suggests that $15,000 Bitcoin and $700 Ethereum are “very much on the table.” What’s more, the image above shows that historical data further paints a bleak picture of Bitcoin’s performance in August and September, historically the worst months with average losses of -7.82% and -5.58%, respectively. Light At The End Of The Tunnel? Despite these bearish factors, crypto analyst Ali Martinez points to the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio on the 30-day time frame, which has not been this low since November 2022, right after the FTX collapse. “That period marked a bottom and an excellent buying opportunity,” he said. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Goes Bearish For The First Time Since August 2023, Will It Crash Below $40,000? Martinez also shared a key support that the bulls must hold to avoid further declines, stating that at around $47,140, nearly 900,000 addresses previously bought 489,000 BTC. Although the Bitcoin price has not tested this level, it will be a crucial level to watch and hold for BTC’s price prospects. Additionally, crypto analyst Rekt Capital points to a dramatic increase in sell-side volume, suggesting a potential near-term bottom and a possible bounce to higher levels, as has happened in the past. Economist and analyst Timothy Peterson’s data shows that in previous instances when the Bitcoin price dropped 25% in 10 days, it has rebounded 62% of the time, with an average gain of 17%. In 20 days, Bitcoin has fully recovered 15% of the time. Also key will be the performance of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, which has previously supported the Bitcoin price leading to the all-time highs reached in March. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has managed to mitigate losses and rebounded to $53,260.

The broader market’s slip and crash are to be blamed for the token’s poor performance. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Drops 23%, But Recent Devs Might Slow The Trend The past 24 hours remain bloody, with the total market cap facing an over 13% decrease. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two top cryptocurrencies, saw their prices decrease by 24% and 31% respectively since last week, showing the market’s vulnerability to the spreading macroeconomic fears in private equity. Cardano Remains Great… Back In July On-chain, Cardano solidified its position as a major player in the crypto space. In a recent X post, the platform revealed several metrics that increased in July. Cardano’s July 2024 On-Chain Stats 📊 We witnessed steady growth in @Cardano‘s on-chain activity last month – this momentum highlights Cardano’s dynamic, growing ecosystem and the ongoing engagement of the community. Let’s continue building a decentralized future together. 🧱 pic.twitter.com/fvhwiG0qrq — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) August 5, 2024 Metrics-wise, the platform remains solid with an increase in every aspect. This should translate to bigger gains or bullish investor behavior on ADA. However, the current environment dashed any possibility to keep investor confidence high. Benjamin Cowen, a crypto analyst, released a post that details a worst-case scenario for the token. However, analysts online are split in opinion on ADA. Although ADA shows almost no change in price since it peaked in May, analysts like Ellert show the possibility that the token might rocket upwards again just like what it did in the past. My friends, It is time. pic.twitter.com/sWR7yXDtgS — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) August 2, 2024 Bullish or not, Cardano is a tested system that shows market downturn won’t stop its operations. As August steps forward, the platform enters its 501st epoch, meaning Cardano didn’t have downtime for over 2,505 days. This remains the most notable achievement of the platform itself as downtimes are the bane of any blockchain network. Despite this, investors are still on board the bullish thesis some analysts are pushing. Staked ADA stooped low as the market flipped from bullish to bearish, prompting a 15-30% decrease in total value locked on Cardano-related chains. The selling pressure remains at a high level due to the market’s continuous bearishness. It Doesn’t Look Good For ADA If the market continues to push downward, there is no reason for the bears to stop their dominance within the market. The token’s position is undefendable. As of writing, the bears are currently trying to break through the October 2023 price level of $0.302. If the bears succeed in taking this level, the token will fall more, possibly returning to pre-2024 prices. Related Reading: Binance Coin In Turmoil: Nearly 10% Value Erased In Market Shake-Up This unprecedented market oversell could also be an opportunity for the bulls. With ADA at a steep discount after this week’s bearish breakthrough, bulls can accumulate ADA at a lower price, thus easing the pressure in the short term giving enough time to stabilize the price. If this happens, $0.302 will be a strong support level for a shot upward, retaking the June-July price range of $0.407-$0.342.

42417506,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYd9J,1722886318,Bitcoin Bounces to $53K After Brutal Sell-Off Reminiscent of Covid Crash,"Crypto prices rebounded only a bit with bitcoin {{BTC}} hitting $55,000 during the U.S. trading session Monday after earlier in the day plunging to just above $49,000.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at $53,000, down 10% over the past 24 hours. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index also posted a similar rebound, but was still 13% lower than 24 hours ago.  Latest News: Bitcoin Jumps Above $56K, Solana Leads Recovery From Monday's Rout  Ether {{ETH}}, which saw an even steeper decline exacerbated by large crypto trading firm selling the asset, saw a similar bounce, but remains down 13% for the session.  The rebound happened as U.S. equity markets also cut some of their early-morning plunge, with the Nasdaq lower by 3.6% shortly before the close versus an earlier tumble of more than 6%.  Brutal but typical drawdown for BTC  It was only a week ago when BTC traded near $70,000 with traders ecstatic about a likely Trump presidency and hopes of making the largest crypto a strategic asset. Since then, prices tumbled 30% from peak to trough, making it the steepest decline during this market cycle.  While the action felt brutal, the magnitude of the drawdown was typical during previous bull markets, Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, noted Monday.  The rapid pace of the drawdown was reminiscent of the Covid-19 triggered crash of 2020, said Daniel Cheung, co-founder of digital asset venture firm Syncracy Capital, even though this was less severe. BTC plummeted 57% in six days in mid-March.  Read More: Bitcoin's Death Cross Is Looming Again  ""Expect crypto to recover relatively quickly given most of the selling at this point is forced and complete panic,"" Cheung said. ""Ironically, the floodgates to a much greater bull market has been opened.""  Matt Hougan, CEO of asset manager Bitwise, also compared this weekend's crash to March 2020 in a market update.  ""It felt as if we might never recover. The media claimed bitcoin had failed its test as a hedge asset,"" Hougan said. ""Emotions aside, history suggests that this weekend’s sell-off is a buying opportunity.""  While the current situation might offer a good long-term entry, short-term risks are present still.

32029111,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633148,1722886213,Bitcoin Crash: Analyst Says A Break Above This Level Will Trigger FOMO,"A popular Bitcoin analyst has suggested a key breakout point for Bitcoin amidst a bearish market price action. While Bitcoin’s price has been experiencing a downward trend, dynamics and movements over the past few months have established several significant price levels. These levels might offer traders valuable insights into Bitcoin’s potential future actions. The $65,000 price mark is one such level, and according to a crypto analyst, a break above it should eventually trigger serious FOMO among market participants. Break Above $65,000 The Bitcoin analysis in question was brought to the attention of the cryptocurrency community on the social media platform X by the pseudonymous analyst known as The Crypto Dog, who boasts a substantial following of more than 804,000 followers. This influential figure in the crypto space has highlighted one of the most critical levels for Bitcoin’s price action, pointing specifically to the $65,000 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Crash A Buying Opportunity? This Whale Thinks So Amidst the prevailing market downturn, the $65,000 level has emerged as a significant point of interest due to the recent consolidation of Bitcoin’s price between the $60,000 and $70,000 range. This consolidation suggests that traders are closely watching these levels for signs of a potential breakout or further decline. The Crypto Dog has noted that if Bitcoin can successfully break above the $65,000 threshold, it could potentially trigger a wave of Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) among market participants. This phenomenon, where traders rush to buy an asset for fear of missing out on potential gains, could create substantial buying pressure. Such a surge in buying activity might provide Bitcoin with the much-needed momentum to significantly break past the $70,000 mark. Being patient but I think that might have been all of the dip.

Bitcoin broke below $50,000 on Monday, August 5, around 6:30 UTC +0 for the first time since early February. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $52,544 and is down by 13.20% in the past 24 hours having rebounded at $49,500. The crypto is also down by 24.30% in a larger seven-day timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crashes Below $3,000 As Revenues Drop To New Lows With this recent action, Bitcoin has now broken below the significant price range of $60,000 to put $50,000 in the spotlight. A rebound just above $49,500 means that $50,000 is now the major support level to monitor. As such, a notable break to the upside from this level could kickstart a little FOMO among market participants. However, $65,000 is still a significant level that could make or break any upward rally.

42417505,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYd8H,1722884261,Is Bitcoin Still a Store of Value?,"On days like this, it's easy to scoff at bitcoin {{BTC}} – specifically, the claim that the original cryptocurrency is a store of value, the digital equivalent of gold.  BTC tumbled along with the broader financial markets Monday and briefly dipped below $50,000, its lowest level since February, before retracing some of its losses. Early afternoon New York time, the asset was off 9% on a 24-hour basis, at $53,387.67.  For skeptics, bitcoin's volatility was an invitation to echo an old Billy Crystal comedy routine: ""Where's your messiah now?""  ""The Bitcoin 'store of value' thesis is getting blown up right now,"" Bloomberg columnist Joe Weisenthal crowed on X (formerly Twitter). ""Bitcoin doesn't look like The New Gold. It looks like 3 tech stocks in a trenchcoat.""  But there's a more nuanced view on this question that requires zooming out the figurative lens.  ""We shouldn't confuse store-of-value assets with flight-to-quality assets,"" said my colleague Andy Baehr, head of product at CoinDesk Indices. ""The former is a long-term expectations property and the latter is a flows and fast market property.""  The ""long term"" part is key.  On a day like Monday, with the Nikkei falling 12% and the vibe inviting comparisons to 1987's ""Black Monday,"" U.S. Treasury bonds ""tend to become this flight-to-quality asset that everybody zooms into,"" Baehr said. Treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction as prices, are at their lowest levels since January.  Bitcoin clearly doesn't enjoy flight-to-quality status.  ""It's still undoubtedly a volatile, in many cases speculative, in many cases levered, in many cases traded asset,"" Baehr said. ""But its properties hold promise that, over time, its scarcity, its portability, and its lack of attachment to any government or corporation's policies make it a really interesting asset to consider as a store of value.""  Investors who look at bitcoin this way are thinking of it not as a safe haven from day-to-day market volatility, but rather as an insurance policy against the steady erosion of the greenback's purchasing power. The supply of bitcoin is predictable and fixed at 21 million, immune from the whims of policy makers.  ""Those who hold it for long periods of time, especially those who have concerns about … the national debt, central bank policy, all of these things … feel as if it's not so much bitcoin going up [that matters] but its denominator declining in value,"" Baehr said.  Counterintuitive though it may seem, it is possible for something to be both a risk asset and a store of value at the same time, he added. ""People who use bitcoin as a store of value are not unaware of its volatility.""  Arthur Breitman, a co-founder of the Tezos blockchain protocol and a crypto O.G., noted that bitcoin's resistance to confiscation makes it a ""store of value"" in another sense.  ""Bitcoin is a good store of value if … bank accounts are being seized,"" he wrote in a reply to Weisenthal on X. ""It's contextual.""  In a separate reply to Weisenthal, Dan McArdle, co-founder of crypto data service Messari, quote-tweeted an old post in which he described how he expected bitcoin to perform during different types of calamities.  It should ""selloff under liquidity-crisis scenarios, ramp on sovereign-debt/fiat-confidence crises,"" McArdle wrote in 2018. Monday was an example of the former.    As for a more time-tested store of value, the price of gold was down about 1% Monday afternoon.  ""It's unfair to judge bitcoin against something that's thousands of years old as a store of value when it's still in its infancy,"" said Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at crypto investment bank Galaxy Digital, referring to comparisons to gold.  Buying bitcoin is a ""venture-like bet on its future as a store of value,"" he said. ""Bitcoin isstill becoming adopted.

32026719,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633279,1722882623,Bitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Investors Dump BTC & ETH For New Cryptocurrency To Regain Market Profits,"In a striking shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, traditional investors in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are increasingly reallocating their assets into newer, high-potential tokens. This article explores why investors are pivoting away from established giants like BTC and ETH and why Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a compelling alternative. The Shift from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Traditional Titans Under Pressure Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have long been the cornerstones of the cryptocurrency world. Bitcoin (BTC), often referred to as “digital gold,” has established itself as a foundational asset, while Ethereum (ETH)’s smart contract capabilities have revolutionized decentralized applications. However, both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are currently facing unique challenges that are prompting investors to seek new opportunities. Bitcoin (BTC)’s market saturation is one of the primary factors driving this shift. As Bitcoin (BTC)’s market capitalization has grown, its growth rate has slowed, making it less attractive for high-risk, high-reward strategies. Investors are now looking for assets with greater potential for rapid appreciation. Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, has struggled with scaling issues. High transaction fees and network congestion have frustrated users and investors alike. Despite ongoing upgrades and the anticipated transition to Ethereum (ETH) 2.0, the pace of improvement has not met some investors’ expectations, leading them to explore alternative assets. Regain Profits With Mpeppe (MPEPE): Among the new entrants capturing investor interest is Mpeppe (MPEPE). Priced currently at $0.00107, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has gained attention due to its innovative features and community-driven approach. This cryptocurrency combines the viral appeal of meme culture with practical decentralized finance (De-Fi) functionalities. Meme Culture Appeal The token leverages the power of meme culture, resonating with a broad audience and capturing the enthusiasm of both casual and serious investors. This viral appeal has been a key factor in its growing popularity, drawing attention from those interested in the next big thing in the crypto world. Global Sports Community Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s focus on building a global community around sports and cryptocurrency adds to its attractiveness. By fostering a community that celebrates sports and embraces crypto innovations, Mpeppe (MPEPE) not only engages a wide audience but also creates a strong foundation for future growth. Implications for the Crypto Market Increased Volatility As investors shift their focus from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to emerging cryptocurrencies like Mpeppe (MPEPE), the market is likely to experience increased volatility. This shift can lead to significant price swings. Market Diversification The move towards new cryptocurrencies reflects a broader trend of market diversification. Investors are looking beyond traditional assets to explore a wider range of opportunities. This trend is likely to drive innovation and competition within the crypto space, benefiting the industry as a whole. Opportunities for New Projects For emerging cryptocurrencies, this trend represents a significant opportunity. With established investors seeking fresh avenues for growth, new projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) have the chance to capture market share and establish themselves as key players in the industry. Conclusion The trend of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investors reallocating their assets into new cryptocurrencies underscores a dynamic shift in the market. While BTC and ETH remain fundamental to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the allure of emerging tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights a growing desire for innovative technologies and high-risk, high-reward opportunities. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, investors and industry participants will need to stay informed and agile to navigate these changes and seize new opportunities.

This dramatic change in BTC’s performance has caused many investors to reevaluate their portfolios, particularly those holding Pepecoin (PEPE). The uncertainty and volatility have prompted PEPE holders to seek new opportunities for substantial gains. The Ripple Effect: How Bitcoin’s Decline Impacts Pepecoin (PEPE) Investors The fall in Bitcoin’s value has had a ripple effect across the cryptocurrency market, impacting investor confidence and prompting a reassessment of holdings. Pepecoin (PEPE) investors, known for their affinity with meme-driven assets, are particularly affected by this shift. As they face potential losses or diminished returns from Pepecoin (PEPE), many are turning to emerging alternatives that promise similar or greater potential for profit. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Emergence: Why It’s Catching the Eye of PEPE Holders In the wake of Bitcoin’s turbulence, Pepecoin (PEPE) holders are increasingly looking at Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a viable alternative. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a strong contender in the meme coin space, offering features and benefits that align with the interests of those who have been successful with Pepecoin (PEPE). The transition to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is driven by its potential for massive gains and its innovative approach to integrating decentralized finance (De-Fi) protocols. Integrating De-Fi: How Mpeppe (MPEPE) Stands Out from PEPE One of the key reasons Pepecoin (PEPE) investors are flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its incorporation of advanced De-Fi features. Unlike PEPE, which primarily focuses on meme culture and community engagement, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a broader range of financial services. By integrating De-Fi protocols, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides access to lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming—all without traditional intermediaries. This additional functionality not only enhances the utility of Mpeppe (MPEPE) but also positions it as a more versatile and promising investment. Why PEPE Holders Are Switching to Mpeppe (MPEPE) The Quest for Greater Returns: Seeking New Opportunities With Bitcoin’s recent price drop creating uncertainty and Pepecoin (PEPE)’s growth potential facing challenges, many investors are turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE). The prospect of substantial returns, coupled with Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative features, offers a new avenue for profit that aligns with the high-risk, high-reward mindset of meme coin enthusiasts. Strategic Diversification: Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a Hedge Against BTC Volatility For Pepecoin (PEPE) holders, diversifying into Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a strategic move to hedge against Bitcoin’s volatility. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to develop and gain traction, its potential for significant growth makes it an attractive option for those looking to offset the impact of Bitcoin’s downturn. The blend of meme culture and De-Fi capabilities provides a unique investment opportunity that could potentially lead to major gains. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a Strategic Investment For Pepecoin (PEPE) investors facing uncertainty due to Bitcoin’s price drop, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an exciting new opportunity. With its innovative De-Fi integrations and strong connection to meme culture, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the potential for substantial profits and strategic diversification. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out as a promising contender in the quest for new and rewarding investment opportunities.

32025617,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633190,1722880837,Why The 4-Year Crypto Cycle Is A Thing Of The Past: Top-Analyst,"The long-held belief in the crypto market’s predictable four-year cycle, characterized by distinct phases of accumulation, uptrend, distribution, and downtrend, is being questioned by top-analyst Jordan Fish, better known as Cobie. He articulated an argument that challenges this traditional view, suggesting that the concept of a cyclic market may no longer hold true. Cobie ignited a debate on X (formerly Twitter) with his assertion, “Unironically [the bull run] has not even started yet.” This statement was met with incredulity by some, such as Maher Abdelsala, who remarked, “Brother people think you are serious lol.” Cobie clarified his stance, stating, “I am serious! Increasingly I like the argument that this is not even a ‘cycle’, really, but it’s more like 2019 with leverage and ETFs.” The End Of The Traditional Crypto Cycle? Cobie’s perspective hinges on the notion that the structural dynamics of the crypto market have fundamentally changed. He draws parallels to the market conditions of 2019, but with significant differences influenced by the proliferation of leverage and the introduction of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). “Was 2019 a new ‘cycle’ or was it part of the bear market?” Cobie pondered. “Floated this idea to a few people in March but everyone told me I was an idiot, which I am, but still it was quite rude to say that to my face.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Liquidations Top $197 Million As Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $60,000 The introduction of ETFs and the increased use of leverage have brought new complexities to the market. These instruments have changed how capital flows into and out of the crypto ecosystem, creating a less predictable and more fragmented market landscape. Cobie emphasized, “Of course if we’re in 2019-looking-2024, it doesn’t mean 2020 plays out the same way, because structurally so much is different now with ETFs and high FDVs and shit, probably too difficult to pattern match too much stuff about the future.” Cobie’s analysis suggests that the current market exhibits a high degree of dispersion, where various assets behave differently rather than moving in unison as seen in previous cycles. This dispersion makes it challenging to identify a single driving force or pattern that governs the entire market. “I think this cycle is so unlike any other cycle it’s probably better to just stop thinking of cycles altogether,” Cobie stated. “It’s clear there is no one single thread pulling everything forward like it did before.” Related Reading: ‘Not All Hope Is Lost’: Crypto Analyst Weighs In On The Market’s Performance This view is reinforced by the performance of certain cryptocurrencies. For instance, Chainlink (LINK) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are cited by Cobie as examples where the traditional hype and subsequent price appreciation may no longer apply. He explained, “I think there’s a very strong likelihood stuff like that could potentially never make new highs again and LINK could just keep existing as a wildly successful oracle without the price appreciation.” The Echo Bubble Phenomenon In the context of market maturity, Cobie referenced the concept of the “echo bubble,” popularized by the renowned trader GCR (Global Coin Research). The echo bubble theory posits that a smaller bubble follows the burst of a larger one, as observed in 2019 following the massive rally in 2017. Cobie expressed surprise at GCR’s recent market behavior, noting, “I actually found it pretty weird GCR kept talking about the echo bubble when he was bullish at the picobottom but then when shit started getting silly he just bought the dogwithhat NFT and broke his hiatus to come and tell people not to sell.” Overall, Cobie believes that the market is currently in a “multi-month/quarter cool-off reaccumulation period” for Bitcoin. He expects Bitcoin to trade within a range of $45,000 to $70,000, with a possibility of a brief breakout to new highs. However, he is pessimistic about the future of many altcoins, particularly those that have survived multiple market cycles. “I def think all the sudden memecoin theses marked an intermediary top for overall risk appetite, and everyone has been conditioned to max long as soon as they think we’re ready to go for it again.” He anticipates that many of these older altcoins will “slowly bleed away and become irrelevant” as speculative investments. This outlook suggests that the market’s risk-on paradigm, characterized by rapid and extensive price increases, may not resume anytime soon. He concludes, “So long story short I think we need a lot more time before the (real) risk on paradigm starts again and I expect more downside to come before it happens.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $51,104.

42417510,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYdDR,1722877743,DePIN and Machine Data Can Change Web3,"Over the past decades, machine data has emerged as one of the world’s most valuable assets. From manufacturing and agriculture to transportation and healthcare, the data generated by machines is driving innovation and efficiency. Yet, despite its immense value, 99% of this data remains trapped in silos, inaccessible and underutilized.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  That creates an opportunity for the integration of machine data into Web3 with decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) offering a transformative solution.  The full potential of DePIN  Using blockchain technology, DePIN enables the tokenization of machines, effectively turning real world assets (RWA) into digital tokens that can be traded, owned and utilized on-chain. This process creates a bridge between the traditional asset markets and blockchain tech, breaking down barriers to RWA investments. It also enables individuals to directly fund and receive returns from services they like and use, providing a stream of passive income.  That is not just a theoretical concept but already a tangible reality. Take, for example, the tokenization of a shared mobility fleet in Vienna. By bringing vehicle data on-chain, the shared mobility provider offered tokenized participation, allowing users to invest in and earn rewards from a vehicle's performance. This democratizes access to valuable assets and improves operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.  Tokenizing machine data and bringing it on-chain is the next logical step in the evolution of DePIN. Imagine a data pool with machine data from public EV charging stations, each collecting data on charging power, the battery level of the EVs in the surrounding area or the current energy grid utilization. Builders in the energy sector have now all the information they need to build dApps that help to balance the electric grid, for instance by offering charging incentives to EV drivers with low battery if there is a surplus of power available. By tokenizing the generated data, it can be securely stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. This data can then be monetized, opening up new revenue streams for charging station owners.  And the best thing about this? Everyone can be part of this. Not just big corporates. Literally everyone. To stay with this example, anyone with a wallbox at home can connect their “machine” and start earning rewards or purchase a fraction of tokenized charging stations via tokens. With Teneo Protocol, we transform data into a valuable asset that can be bought, sold, or traded.  Beyond tokenization & monetization  The benefits of bringing machine data on-chain go far beyond tokenization or monetization. One of the most promising applications is in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Today's AI models require vast amounts of data to train effectively, yet real-time machine data remains relatively untapped. By making the high-quality data accessible on-chain, DePIN enables the development of more accurate and efficient AI models, driving advancements in predictive maintenance, performance optimization, and other critical areas.  Moreover, integrating machine data into Web3 enhances data integrity and security. Blockchain technology ensures that data is stored in a transparent and tamper-proof manner, addressing the issues of data manipulation and unauthorized access. This is particularly important for Web2 industries where data accuracy and security are essential, such as Health care and finance.  However, the transition to a fully integrated Web3 ecosystem is not without challenges. One of the primary hurdles is the need for robust infrastructure to support the secure and efficient transfer of data. This requires advancements in both blockchain technology and the underlying hardware.  Despite these challenges, the benefits of integrating machine data into web3 far outweigh the obstacles. As more industries recognize the value of tokenizing their assets and leveraging blockchain technology, we can expect to see a significant shift towards more decentralized and efficient systems.  So can machine data change Web3? Absolutely! This new era of Web3, powered by DePIN, will unlock unprecedented opportunities for innovation, growth and collaboration. And it’s getting real.

32013636,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633210,1722875681,"Ethereum ETFs Struggles To Have a Positive Impact On Price, Whilst Investors Purchase Now Crypto at $0.00107","The recent performance of Ethereum (ETH) and the emergence of new tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are capturing the attention of investors. While Ethereum (ETH) ETFs have yet to produce the anticipated boost in price, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining traction as an intriguing investment opportunity. Here’s why investors are shifting their focus to Mpeppe (MPEPE) at its current price of $0.00107, despite the challenges faced by Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Ethereum ETFs: A Disappointing Performance The Promise of Ethereum ETFs Ethereum (ETH) ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) were initially hailed as a breakthrough for cryptocurrency investments. They promised to provide traditional investors with easier access to Ethereum (ETH), leveraging the security and regulatory framework of traditional financial products. The expectation was that these ETFs would drive up Ethereum (ETH)’s price by bringing in institutional and retail investors who previously hesitated to enter the crypto market. The Reality of Market Impact Despite the initial excitement, Ethereum ETFs have struggled to make a significant impact on the price of Ethereum (ETH). Several factors contribute to this underwhelming performance: – Market Saturation: Ethereum (ETH) has been available on numerous exchanges and trading platforms for years. The introduction of ETFs may not have brought the fresh demand anticipated due to the already established market presence of Ethereum (ETH). – Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing regulatory concerns and uncertainties surrounding the broader cryptocurrency market can dampen investor enthusiasm, making it challenging for ETFs to perform as expected. – Market Sentiment: Broader market conditions and sentiment often play a crucial role in price movements. With the volatility and uncertainties in the crypto space, the influence of ETFs on Ethereum (ETH)’s price has been limited. Investors Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) Amidst the struggles of Ethereum ETFs, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a promising investment alternative. Currently priced at $0.00107, Mpeppe is gaining attention for several reasons: – Innovative Approach: Mpeppe (MPEPE) blends the excitement of meme culture with the robust capabilities of decentralized finance (De-Fi). This unique combination sets it apart from more traditional crypto assets and attracts investors looking for fresh opportunities. – Community and Purpose: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another token. It aims to foster a global community that celebrates soccer and leverages blockchain technology for real-world impact. This focus on community building and strategic planning resonates with investors who value both financial growth and social impact. The Strategic Shift: Why Now is the Time for Mpeppe Market Dynamics and Investor Sentiment In light of Ethereum ETFs’ struggles and the evolving dynamics of the crypto market, investors are increasingly looking for assets with potential for substantial growth and innovative features. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling case due to its novel approach and strong community focus. Value Proposition at $0.00107 Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s current price of $0.00107 presents a unique entry point for investors. The token’s low price, combined with its De-Fi capabilities and community-driven approach, makes it an attractive option for those seeking high-growth potential in the crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Landscape Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a promising alternative to Ethereum ETFs due to its innovative De-Fi protocol integration, strong community focus, and attractive pricing. Diversifying investment strategies and exploring new opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE) can provide significant returns in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

32022072,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633219,1722875454,Why Is The Shiba Inu Price Crashing Today?,"With the Bitcoin price crash over the weekend, the prices of other cryptocurrencies such as Shiba Inu have followed sharply. The result of this has been a double-digit price crash for Shiba Inu, alongside other altcoins. Naturally, the rapid decline has raised questions, with industry stakeholders wondering what is driving this massive crash. Shiba Inu Price Crash Is Following Bitcoin The Shiba Inu price crash being experienced today is not a result of a single event occurring for the meme coin. Rather, it is linked to a further market-wide crash that began with the Bitcoin price first falling below $60,000 and eventually breaking $50,000 on Monday. Therefore, to get the real reason behind the Shiba Inu price crash, we must look at the reason driving the Bitcoin crash. Related Reading: MATIC: Market Nosedive Leads To 30% Wipe In Value So far, Bitcoin, and the broader crypto market, has been responding to major events happening around the world. These are outline by pro trader Adam Khoo in an X (formerly Twitter) post, revealing a much deeper reason for the decline. One of these major events is the decline in the Japanese stock market, which is seeing its largest single-day decline since 1987. As Khoo outlined, traders on the Japanese stock exchange had borrowed the Japanese Yen at low interest rates to convert to United States Dollar, which is, in turn, used to buy US stocks for a larger gain. This strategy has worked for the trader as Yen’s interest rates remained low. However, the Japanese government raised interest rates, meaning that these traders were now dealing with massive losses as the Yen strengthened against the US dollar. The result of this is a large sell-off as traders scramble to pay back their loans while taking huge losses in the process. Naturally, this led to a decline in US stocks and the likes of Bitcoin and Shiba Inu have been reacting to this market decline. The sharp rise in the JPY/USD is causing a massive unwind of Yen carry trade positions and contributing to the sharp decline in US stocks. For those who do not understand how this works, a brief explanation 1) Many traders were borrowing Jap Yen (JPY) at low interest rates,… pic.twitter.com/sfi0Hva56M — Adam Khoo (@adamkhootrader) August 5, 2024 Not only this, other major events such as war escalation in the Middle East, as well as the US presidential elections having no clear winner yet, has driven prices down further. With fear and panic spreading, more investors are selling, causing an already deep decline to depend further.

According to him, this is a great time to “take advantage of temporary mis-pricing caused by short term crisis.” Presently, the Shiba Inu price is sitting at $0.00001111 – its lowest level in six months. Going by the trader’s sentiment, this could be a good time to get into coins such as Shiba Inu, as a rebound from here could lead to new all-time highs.

32021908,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=23950,1722873653,How has the Market Responded to the Ethereum ETF Launch?,"The launch of Ethereum ETFs represents an important step forward in the integration of digital assets into traditional finance, allowing investors to directly access exposure to ether through familiar investment vehicles. This event has drawn substantial interest from prominent financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, enhancing Ethereum’s legitimacy and accessibility. While initial trading volumes were notable, they were lower compared to Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting varying expectations about their impact on ether’s price and market dynamics. The approval of these ETFs signals a potential shift in regulatory attitudes towards cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for further innovation and broader acceptance in the financial industry. Ethereum ETF Launch Falls Just Short of Bitcoin’s ETF Debut The launch of Ethereum ETFs on July 23, 2024, marks an important milestone for the digital assets industry, offering new avenues for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to ether, the native utility token of the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike previous Ethereum-related products that tracked futures contracts, these ETFs directly invest in spot ether, providing a more accurate reflection of the cryptocurrency’s market value. The introduction of these ETFs is seen as a major step towards integrating digital assets into traditional financial systems, making it easier for investors to access Ethereum through familiar investment vehicles like ETFs, which are listed on major exchanges such as the CBOE, Nasdaq, and NYSE. The Ethereum ETFs come from a variety of prominent financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and others, each offering unique features and fee structures to attract investors. While most funds have waived fees for a limited period, some like Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust offer exceptionally low fees even beyond the promotional period. This competition among issuers reflects an increasing trend of making digital asset investments more accessible and cost-effective for a wider audience. The entry of such reputable players into the Ethereum ETF market not only enhances the legitimacy of ether as an asset but also demonstrates a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency investments in traditional finance. The impact of these ETFs on Ethereum’s price and the broader market remains a subject of speculation. While the initial trading volumes were substantial, they were notably lower than the launch volumes of Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. Analysts are divided on the potential for Ethereum ETFs to attract the same level of inflows as Bitcoin ETFs, with some projecting significant capital inflows that could drive ether’s price higher, while others remain cautious due to Ethereum’s relatively smaller market cap and the absence of a clear, defining narrative like Bitcoin’s “digital gold.” Nevertheless, the introduction of these ETFs is expected to increase liquidity and potentially reduce volatility in the Ethereum market, providing a more stable environment for both short-term traders and long-term investors. The implications of Ethereum ETF approval extend beyond market dynamics. This development could pave the way for further innovation in financial products related to other cryptocurrencies like the current discussions around potential Solana ETFs , or in Ethereum’s case, including the potential future integration of staking features. The SEC’s approval of these ETFs also suggests a gradual shift in regulatory attitudes towards cryptocurrencies, potentially opening the door for other digital assets to gain similar recognition and legitimacy. As more investors gain exposure to ether through regulated channels, the Ethereum blockchain’s role as the core technology for decentralised finance (DeFi) and other applications may become more widely acknowledged, further solidifying its position in the digital asset ecosystem. An Overview of the Initial Performance of the Ethereum ETFs The initial response to the launch of Ethereum ETFs has been optimistic but not overwhelmingly exuberant. The trading volumes and inflows were respectable but fell short of the record-setting figures seen during the launch of Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. While the first day of trading saw inflows of $2.2 billion across the newly introduced funds, it was notably less than the $4.6 billion seen with Bitcoin ETFs on their debut trading day. The most significant activity was observed in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust and BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, indicating solid interest but not a groundbreaking rush. The cumulative amount trading volume for all Ethereum spot ETFs was $4.05 billion in the first week, compared to $11.82 billion of cumulative volume for the Bitcoin ETFs. On July 30th, Ethereum ETF inflows flipped positive for the first time, due to a temporary slowdown in outflows from Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust. Since the launch, inflows into Ethereum ETFs have continued steadily, with data indicating that they have attracted several billion dollars within the first week. However, the pace has not matched the early predictions that some analysts had made, with estimates suggesting that the initial enthusiasm might not sustain at high levels. The absence of staking capabilities within these ETFs has been a notable concern, as staking offers a way to earn block rewards by participating in the network’s consensus process to earn newly minted ETH in return for securing the network. This absence of staking benefits in the ETH ETFs may lead some investors to purchase ether directly to take advantage of staking, rather than through ETFs, giving them not only staking rewards, but also more direct control over their assets. The lack of staking in the ETFs presents a potential drawback, particularly for investors looking for ways to maximise their returns. Staking can provide additional yield, making it an attractive option for ether holders, especially considering liquid staking which allows ETH holders to stake coins and earn yield while still accessing the underlying locked liquidity value. Without this feature, the ETFs may seem less appealing to those seeking to benefit from Ethereum’s staking ecosystem, although this limitation may change in the future. As a result, while the ETFs offer a convenient way for traditional investors to gain exposure to ether, they might not fully satisfy the appetite of more yield-seeking investors, potentially driving them to hold ether directly in a crypto wallet. Investors who currently hold ether directly, have been staking more than ever in the run up to the launch of the Ethereum ETFs, recently reaching a milestone of 28% of the total supply or over 33 million ETH, currently being staked. Institutional interest in Ethereum ETFs has been notably strong , surpassing that of retail investors. According to market analysts, institutional investors have been more aggressive in increasing their exposure to ether, reflecting a bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency’s potential. This enthusiasm among institutions is significant, as their larger capital allocations can have a more substantial impact on price movements. In contrast, retail investors have shown cautious optimism, gradually increasing their holdings but not at quite the same pace as institutional players. Overall, the response from both retail and institutional investors demonstrates a growing interest in Ethereum ETFs. While they may not have stolen the spotlight from Bitcoin ETFs, their launch marks a significant step in mainstream acceptance of the greater digital assets market, potentially paving the way for further innovation, integrations and increased institutional involvement in the future. As regulatory clarity improves and the market evolves, Ethereum’s unique attributes and applications could make it an increasingly attractive investment. Do Ethereum ETFs Have the Potential to Create a Bigger Impact Than Bitcoin ETFs? Ethereum’s position as the second-largest and most valuable digital asset is bolstered by its extremely active and innovative developer community, which has been instrumental in advancing blockchain technology. The Ethereum community has not only proliferated the Solidity smart contract language throughout the industry, but has also created a suite of developer tools that make Ethereum the most accessible platform for building Decentralised Applications (DApps). The widespread use of these tools has enabled a flourishing ecosystem of Web3 projects, positioning Ethereum as the technological foundation of this new decentralised multi-chain digital ecosystem. The launch of Ethereum ETFs could thus act as the way to kick the door wide open, sparking a wave of institutional interest and potentially accelerating the integration of digital assets into traditional financial markets. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) serves as the foundational layer for many blockchains in the Web3 space, including various DeFi platforms and other DApp ecosystems. It was recently reported that 90% of blockchain developers work on EVM compatible blockchains. EVM’s compatibility with multiple Web3 blockchains makes it a critical infrastructure component, facilitating interoperability and innovation across the industry. The ubiquitous nature of the EVM in Web3 makes it stunningly simple to port smart contracts and DApps over to other EVM-compatible chains. The introduction of Ethereum ETFs could enhance the credibility of Ethereum-based tech stacks in other projects, encouraging institutions to explore investment opportunities not just in ETH but in other EVM-compatible assets. This increased institutional participation could lead to greater liquidity and stability in the overall digital asset market, making it more attractive for developers and entrepreneurs to build on Ethereum or interoperable and compatible Web3 platforms. Ethereum’s role in the development and expansion of DeFi can’t be taken for granted. The platform’s smart contract capabilities have enabled the creation of complex financial instruments and services that operate without intermediaries. As institutions become more comfortable with Ethereum through ETF investments, they may also begin to explore the broader DeFi ecosystem, more seriously. This could result in the creation of new financial products and services that integrate traditional finance with DeFi, potentially revolutionising the way financial markets operate. The seamless flow of capital between these two realms could lead to innovative hybrid products that offer unique benefits to both retail and institutional investors. The more limited smart contracting capabilities of Bitcoin, may not be sufficient to generate the same kind of interest. The implications of Ethereum’s influence extend beyond its own blockchain. Ethereum’s success has inspired 196 other blockchain projects that either directly integrate with Ethereum or utilise similar technological frameworks. The launch of Ethereum ETFs could set a precedent for other digital assets, encouraging the development of ETFs based on alternative blockchains. This could pave the way for a diverse range of Web3 financial products, leveraging the unique capabilities of different blockchains within the ecosystem. As a result, we could witness a more interconnected and sophisticated digital asset market, with Ethereum at the centre of this transformative wave. For these reasons, Ethereum ETFs have the potential to exert a much larger long-term impact than Bitcoin ETFs, despite a comparatively weaker initial performance at launch. Ethereum’s extensive developer community, pioneering technology like the EVM and Solidity, and its central role in the Web3 and DeFi ecosystems position it as a key infrastructural foundation for the future of digital finance. As institutions gain exposure to Ethereum through these ETFs, they may increasingly recognise its broader applications and potential for innovation, driving more substantial integration and adoption across both digital and traditional financial markets. This could lead to a more profound and lasting influence on the overall financial landscape, far surpassing the initial scope of Bitcoin ETFs.

This marks the lowest price since February 14th. The downward momentum accelerated on August 2nd with a 6.01 percent daily decline, the largest since April 2nd, leading to a total 14.52 percent peak-to-trough drop. Altcoins, particularly SOL, saw even larger declines . BTC failed to hold key support at $65,580, suggesting the potential for further declines. Liquidations totalled $1.16 billion in the last 24 hours, primarily affecting long positions. The price is expected to have a small move upwards towards the $55,000 region despite bearish market sentiment and significant declines in Japanese and US stock markets. However, the general market trajectory will depend on macroeconomic factors The broader market instability, influenced by economic and political developments, is impacting cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets. The recent turmoil in the Japanese stock market and losses on Wall Street highlight the interconnectedness of global markets. BTC’s correlation with traditional financial markets is increasing, suggesting continued downward pressure if stock market declines persist. Meanwhile, the US labour market showed clear signs of slowing down , as the unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent, up from a record low of 3.4 percent in April 2023. This increase marks the highest unemployment rate since October 2021. Job growth decelerated notably, with only 114,000 new positions added during the month. Despite these signs of a cooling market, the June job openings report indicated a modest decline, with the previous month’s data revisions suggesting a steady yet not alarming slowdown. Amid these labour market concerns, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) opted to keep the federal funds rate steady within the range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent on July 31st, hinting at a potential shift towards easing its restrictive monetary stance. Adding a positive note to the economic narrative, the second quarter saw a surge in labour productivity, underscoring continued economic strength and resilience despite the challenges in the labour market. In the latest news from the crypto-sphere, Genesis Global has completed its restructuring and begun repaying around $4 billion in digital assets and US dollars to creditors following its January 2023 bankruptcy. Bitcoin creditors will recover 51.28 percent, Ethereum creditors 65.87 percent, and Solana creditors 29.58 percent, while those owed stablecoins or US dollars will receive full repayment. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy expanded its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring 12,222 bitcoins for $805.2 million in Q2 and introduced a new KPI called BTC yield to assess its Bitcoin strategy’s performance. Despite positive growth in software subscriptions and global Bitcoin adoption, MicroStrategy reported a significant quarterly loss, missing revenue and earnings expectations. In contrast, Tether reported a record net profit of $5.2 billion for the first half of 2024, with a net operating profit of $1.3 billion in Q2, driven by yield-bearing investments and reserves. As of June 30, 2024, Tether’s reserves for tokens in circulation totalled $118.4 billion, with liabilities at $113.1 billion, resulting in a $5.3 billion surplus.

42417513,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYdET,1722872023,Crypto Candidate in Arizona Is Winning (So Far) Despite Sen. Warren's Headwinds,"A deluge of crypto-industry money may have helped achieve a very narrow Arizona congressional primary win this week for Yassamin Ansari, a crypto-cheering Phoenix City Council member who faced a candidate backed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)  But the race between Democrats Ansari and Raquel Terán, who'd been endorsed by leading crypto critic Warren, has come down to a 67-vote gap almost a week after that state's elections, and Ansari's lead has narrowed each time a new batch was tallied. Wider Maricopa County, which includes the 3rd district, still has an estimated 2,089 ballots to count, according to the secretary of state's office, and the current margin of less than 0.2% in Arizona's 3rd Congressional District is well below the half-percent threshold required for an automatic recount.  Even if Ansari wins the first tally, she'd likely have to await a formal recount to make it official.  Ansari's campaign saw about $1.4 million in crypto political action committee (PAC) spending that either supported her or opposed Terán, according to a PAC spokesman. Ansari, who had signed a recent letter to the Democratic National Committee in which lawmakers and candidates requested the party platform include a pro-crypto stance, has so far claimed about 44.6% of the vote against Terán's 44.5% in a district that would tend to favor a Democrat in November's general elections.  The Fairshake super PAC and its affiliates generally purchase ads that support industry-favoring candidates without being directly approved by those candidates, and Fairshake has quickly become one of the country's largest PACs. This approach to ""independent expenditures"" allows the crypto sector and other industries to devote unlimited money to political contests under U.S. campaign-finance laws. In Ansari's case, the spending amounted to about $74 for each of the votes in her column.  Read More: Crypto Giants Notch Wins in Expensive Quest to Sway U.S. Politics – Without Mentioning Crypto  Fairshake spokesman Josh Vlasto declined to comment on the Arizona race, because the result isn't yet official.  Ansari's own campaign netted a comparative $1.9 million in direct donations, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures, suggesting that Fairshake's similar spending level may have had a significant impact on the race. Whether it did or not, the candidate's opponent lashed out at Ansari for taking outside money from crypto interests. That support included ads from a PAC affiliated with Fairshake and also direct donations from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Though some polling conducted as recently as April showed Terán with an advantage, the close race favors Ansari at this point.  This is not the first time crypto support has been raised as a contentious campaign issue. Such accusations came up, too, in Shomari Figures' similar win in Alabama and in the Senate primary defeat for Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.). But voters haven't apparently been moved by worries about crypto-sector influence.  The industry took two losses in Arizona, too, for candidates Fairshake's affiliate PACs supported. The PAC had backed Andrei Cherny in the Arizona 1st District Democratic primary, but he placed second in a crowded field. And it spent almost $600,000 on Republican Blake Masters in the 8th Congressional District contest, where the former Arizona Senate candidate similarly came in second among several candidates.  Digital assets interests have already seen more than 20 favored candidates win primary elections this year, potentially including Ansari. While crypto legislation hasn't yet cleared the current Congress, next year's session will include a larger number of potentially supportive members in the House of Representatives and Senate.  U.S. congressional primaries are in their final days, with a few states finishing this week, meaning the towering crypto industry PAC will soon shift to the general election.

Given that the pioneer cryptocurrency has been around the longest, the abundance of data makes it possible to use this indicator in an attempt to pinpoint where the price might be headed next. This time around, the indicator is turning bearish, which means that the Bitcoin price could be headed toward further decline from here. Analyst Says RSI Is Turning Bearish For Bitcoin Crypto analyst Alan Santana took to the TradingView website to share a bearish development for the Bitcoin price. The analysis, which focused on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), shows a continuation of the bearish trend as Bitcoin is poised to fall further. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crashes Below $3,000 As Revenues Drop To New Lows The crypto analyst, using the Bitcoin weekly chart, shows that the RSI is actually flashing a 3-year long bearish divergence. This is backed up by the RSI chart which showed a continuous decline over the the year 2024 after reaching a local peak at the start of the year. Bitcoin’s RSI has declined around 42% since the year began, going from as high as 88 to 50.6 at the time of the analysis. However, Alan Santana uses a longer timeframe from 2021 to 2024, showing a bearish divergence in this indicator. This bearish divergence has emerged as the RSI indicator presented a lower high in 2024 compared to the 95 peak of 2021. According to the analyst, this means that the RSI indicator is now turning bearish for the first time since August 2023. This makes it the most bearish that the Bitcoin indicator has become in one year. How Low Will The BTC Price Drop? At the time of the analysis, the Bitcoin price had already seen a brutal drop from $70,000 to below $60,000 before a small recovery at the time of the writing. However, the crypto analyst does not believe this is the end and warns investors to expect further decline. Related Reading: Can XRP Rally 1,000X Despite The Drop Below $0.6? Going by the chart, Alan Santana expects that the Bitcoin price will fall over 20% from here once more. This would mean a price decline below $50,000. The crypto analyst puts the bottom of this decline at around $44,000. If this forecast were to materialize, it would mean the price would revisit the $40,000 level for the first time since January 2024. However, it is not all bad news as the crypto analyst explains that “This, and other signals, is telling us that there is room for lower prices; much lower, before we experience new highs and boom growth.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-rsi-bearish-40000/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/32018397.jpeg

42417514,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYdGX,1722866464,"Harris Likely to Pick Pennsylvania Gov. Shapiro for Veep, Prediction Markets Say","This week in prediction markets:  Kamala Harris will likely pick Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate.  Harris has gained on Donald Trump on Polymarket but hasn't closed the gap, unlike in polls.  Traders are betting on the Olympic women's boxing controversy.  The Fed will cut rates fast and hard in September, say bettors  U.S. Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday, and prediction markets show a clear consensus on whom she'll pick.  Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, has the highest probability of getting the nod, according to traders on Polymarket, the crypto-based betting platform.  ""Yes"" shares for Shapiro were trading at 68 cents Monday during morning hours in New York, indicating the market sees a 68% chance he will be the Democratic nominee for vice president. Each share pays out $1 (in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency whose value is tied to the dollar) if the prediction comes true, and zero if not. The bets are programmed into a smart contract on the Polygon blockchain.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz trails behind Shapiro with 23% odds. All other listed candidates are showing single-digit probabilities. A total of $104 million has been bet on the Democratic vice presidential contract, making it Polymarket's third-largest by volume.  Shapiro is popular among his constituents in a battleground state, with a 61% approval rating, according to a poll released by Fox News last month. Many on the left wing of the Democratic party dislike him for his support for Israel and school vouchers.  PredictIt, a more traditional betting site where trades are settled in old-fashioned dollars, shows a similar pattern, with 66% odds for Shapiro and 26% for Walz.  Polymarket, founded in 2020, has been enjoying a breakout year amid enthusiasm for election betting. Monthly volume more than tripled from June to $387 million in July, according to Dune Analytics.  Prediction markets allow traders to bet on the outcomes of real-world events, from elections to sporting matches to the weather. Proponents say they are a more reliable measure of sentiment and source of forecasts than polls because bettors have money on the line and are strongly incentivized to do thorough research and express their true beliefs.  Harris gains on Trump  The last few weeks of prediction market sentiment and polling data show that the U.S. presidential race was less of a test of Donald Trump's popularity, and more of an expression of incumbent Joe Biden's unpopularity.  Polls indicate Harris has effectively closed the gap with Trump, and is now tied in polling aggregator 538's averages.  Harris has the same momentum in prediction markets, but hasn't yet closed the gap.  Bettors on Polymarket are putting the race at 53-44 for Trump, with Harris up six percentage points in the past week.  Traders are also putting their money on Harris flipping Trump on RealClear Polling's average, which currently has Trump at 47.7% versus Harris at 46.9%.  Markets that measure a second-order effect of Harris' surge are also feeling an effect.  While a balance-of-power contract still has a Republican sweep as the highest-probability outcome at 30%, markets that call for Democrats to take the presidency and at least one house of Congress have all seen gains.  Likewise, another contract that asks if Trump will win every swing state is down four percentage points in the last week, and 35 percentage points in the last month since Biden's gaffe-ridden performance debating Trump.  The market is waiting for the first Trump-Harris debate to be confirmed, an event that could certainly move markets. Trump's camp has said that a debate with Harris scheduled for Sept. 10 on ABC has been ""terminated"" with Biden's departure, and instead proposed a debate a few days earlier on Republican-friendly Fox News – complete with a full arena audience.  So far the Harris campaign has said no, and the market agrees that she won't show up, pricing in a 37% chance of it happening before Oct. 15.  Culture-war bets  The International Olympic Committee says boxers Yu-Ting Lin, from Taiwan, and Imane Khelif, from Algeria, are biological females.  On Crypto Twitter, which remained skeptical of IOC claims, a meme quickly emerged about the easy money to be made betting on contestants accused of being men competing in women's sports.  But did this meme translate into a higher betting volume compared to other sports markets?  Sort of.  A contract on Polymarket asking bettors to pick the outcome of the Olympic Women's Welterweight boxing competition, where Khelif is competing, has just over $60,000 in volume, which puts it squarely in the middle of sports contracts on the site.  Contracts asking bettors which country will win the most medals, and the outcome of basketball, soccer contests, men's tennis, or 100 meter dash all have significantly more market interest, with basketball leading the pack at $1.5 million.  This makes sense because basketball and soccer are more popular than women's boxing, tennis has household names such as Novak Djokovic competing, and the photo-finish nature of the 100-meter dash brings out bettors' animal instincts.  But the women's boxing contract still has much more volume than other well-known sports or personalities, like one asking about gymnast Simone Biles' – star of a recent Netflix documentary – medal count.  If anything, controversy can be good for sports. Just look at the viewership ratings for the Olympics, which became a culture war flashpoint during the opening ceremony: they are way up.  Rate cuts soon?  The unwinding of the Japanese Yen carry trade made the Monday trading day a bloodbath for crypto, with over $1 billion in liquidations during Asia trading hours, pushing ether down 20% and bitcoin 15%, erasing gains made year-to-date. When markets opened in the U.S. the global selloff intensified.  All this has accelerated the conversation about rate cuts in the U.S. Earlier this year, a sizable minority of traders said cuts weren't going to be on the agenda, with the market giving close to a 60% chance of there being at most one.  Now, bettors on Kalshi, the U.S.-regulated prediction market platform where trades are settled in dollars, are punting on a 100 basis point cut happening this year, and a 90% chance of the first cut happening after the September meeting.  On Polymarket, bettors have upped the ante, giving the possibility of an emergency Fed meeting – defined as a meeting called outside the usual planned schedule – a 60% chance of happening.  Interestingly, traders in traditional markets via interest rate futures have priced in a 100% chance of 50 basis points or more of Fed rate cuts by the bank's September meeting versus Polymarket, where bettors are seeing just a 66% chance of the same thing.  If there's an encouraging signal from all of this for crypto, it's that bitcoin won't fall much more. Bitcoin traded below $50,000 during Asia business hours Monday before recovering. Kalshi bettors say it will go to $44,000 at its lowest before year's end, while Polymarket bettors are giving it a 56% chance that it won't go below $45,000 by the end of August.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Sam Reynolds, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/08/05/harris-likely-to-pick-pennsylvania-gov-shapiro-for-veep-prediction-markets-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47f0b23078486fb34d2b3ef00c1f58b007c08620-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

How is it capturing value? — TT 🥭 & FUD Farmer (@TTLinkie3299) August 2, 2024 Despite the skepticism of the follower base in Chainlink, the organization continues to receive positive news at the start of the month. Last week, Concero, a blockchain infrastructure platform, announced its selection of Chainlink’s CCIP for “secure cross-chain interoperability.” Concero also joined Chainlink Build, a partnership program that grants them enhanced access to Chainlink services which guarantees the quality of the data stream they’ll receive. Another addition to the Chainlink Build family is Rivalz AI, the “first AI intel layer”, which will help the latter in the security of its AI-driven data network. Since the Build program is a two-way street, Rivalz made 3% of its token supply available to Chainlink stakers and providers which is an enticing offer to would-be stakers on Chainlink. However, sell pressure continues to plague LINK completely negating the attractiveness of the new additions to Chainlink’s growing Build program. The platform also suffered a massive outflow of staked crypto. According to DeFiLlama, Chainlink suffered a 20% decrease in total value locked (TVL).

However, the current environment of anxiety and fear will hinder efforts to retake lost ground.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Latest News: Bitcoin Jumps Above $56K, Solana Leads Recovery From Monday's Rout  Cryptos crashed as risk-off sentiment permeated global markets. Bitcoin {{BTC}} tumbled below $60,000 during the weekend, then nosedived to $49,300 during Monday's Asian morning as investors fled risk assets. Bitcoin is down nearly 15% in the past 24 hours, recovering to near $52,000. Ether {{ETH}} fell 22% to $2,100, recording its biggest one-day fall since 2021. The altcoin-heavy broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) slid nearly 20%, with crypto majors solana {{SOL}} and Near Protocol {{NEAR}} plummeting 20%-25%. ""Feels like we have been hit by a perfect storm,"" QCP analysts said in a market update. What started the sentiment shift was Friday's U.S. economic and jobs data igniting recession fears, coupled with rising tensions in the Middle East. The Japanese yen spiked against the U.S. dollar, leading to an unwind of trades across asset classes, with Asian equity indexes suffering record routs on Monday: The Taiwanese index, for example, had its worst day in 57 years. QCP also pointed to crypto trading giant Jump selling off assets, exacerbating the decline.  Crypto-related company stocks slid with digital asset prices. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) dropped more than 9% in U.S. pre-market trading, while MicroStrategy (MSTR), which has a policy of buying bitcoin and holds more than 1% of the total supply that will ever be issued, lost 13%. CoinShares, a crypto asset manager, fell 7.5% in Sweden. U.S.-listed miners Marathon Digital (MARA) and Iren (IREN) both lost almost 14%, Hut 8 (HUT) fell 12% and Riot Platforms (RIOT) lost 11%.

Ether futures recorded over $340 million in liquidated bets and bitcoin futures losses led at $420 million. Futures tracking Solana’s SOL, dogecoin {{DOGE}}, XRP {{XRP}} and pepe {{PEPE}} took on $75 million in cumulative liquidations.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's six-month skew, measuring the spread between prices on calls and puts.

32011264,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633174,1722859230,Solana Plummets 17% As SOL Hits $118: Is a Break Below Inevitable?,"Solana (SOL) is currently experiencing a significant decline, dropping over 17% and reaching the critical $118 support level. This sharp downturn has put considerable pressure on this key level, raising concerns among traders and investors about the possibility of a further breakdown. The $118 level has historically been a stronghold for the cryptocurrency, but with the current bearish sentiment in the market, its ability to hold is still being determined. With the help of key technical indicators, this article will provide an in-depth analysis of Solana’s current price actions, assess the likelihood of breaking the $118 support, and explore potential scenarios for SOL. As of the time of writing, Solana has dropped by 17%, trading at approximately $119.78 in the past 24 hours. Solana boasts a market capitalization exceeding $54 billion, which demonstrates a decrease of 18.45% and a trading volume surpassing $9.4 billion, indicating an increase of 182.21% in the past 24 hours. Technical Analysis: Indicators Pointing To A Potential Break For Solana On the 4-hour chart, Solana has demonstrated significant bearish momentum, with the price dropping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and currently attempting a break below the $118 support level. A successful breach below this key level could lead to a further bearish move for the cryptocurrency. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart has dropped to 24.74%, which is considered to be an oversold zone. This position of the RSI indicator signals that SOL could extend its bearish move beyond $118. On the 1-day chart, Solana has experienced increased selling pressure as the price consistently forms bearish candlesticks. Specifically, this pattern shows sellers are gaining control over the market, pushing the price lower with each successive trading session. Also, the formation of these bearish candlesticks, characterized by closing prices lower than their opening prices, reflects a pattern of sustained selling, which is often a sign of underlying weakness in the asset. Finally, the 1-day RSI has also dropped below 50%, which further supports the possibility of further price drop. This drop suggests that bearish pressure is rising, as sellers are still active and influential in the market. The fact that sellers are still active implies that Solana will probably continue to decline. Potential Scenarios: What Happens if $118 Fails? If Solana can maintain its current bearish momentum and close below the $118 support level, it may continue to move downward to challenge the $99.44 support level. When this level is breached, the digital asset may experience further price loss toward the $79.24 support range and possibly other ranges below. Conversely, should SOL’s price close above the $118 support level, it will start to ascend once more toward the $160 resistance point. Following a break above this level, the crypto asset may see further price gain to challenge the $170 resistance level and perhaps other levels above.

MSTR's use of convertibles to finance BTC purchases at low interest rates is a clever strategy to maximize BTC Yield and leverage their capital structure. Despite a mediocre software business, MSTR's focus on BTC Yield make it a compelling buy, although short-term BTC price volatility remains a risk. I would have liked to hear some info about their Bitcoin-based product launches like MicroStrategy Orange. This could be a compelling value driver in the future. This article is about my takeaways from the MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) Q2 earnings call on 1 August 2024. I was pretty impressed with everything, although there is one thing I wished we’d heard more about. Overall, I am even more bullish on the stock after this call because it seems that management is clearly setting the foundation for greater clarity amongst investors on what exactly is MicroStrategy’s strategy with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). BTC Yield The main thing was MSTR’s new KPI which they call “BTC Yield.” In the words of Phong Le, CEO of MicroStrategy: We define BTC Yield as the period-to-period percentage change in the ratio of our total bitcoin holdings to our assumed diluted shares outstanding. Here is how the KPI specifically deals with dilution from convertibles and stock options because a lot of people will undoubtedly have questions in that area: When we refer to assumed diluted shares outstanding, we're assuming all outstanding convertible notes or fully converted at the respective conversion prices. All outstanding options are fully exercised. And all restricted stock units and performance stock units fully vest, in each case without regard to exercise or conversion price or investing or other contractual conditions. When I saw this, I immediately understood what he was getting at. You see, perhaps the biggest controversy regarding MSTR is why it trades at a persistent premium to the BTC it holds on its balance sheet. A lot of investors cannot figure it out. Kerrisdale recently published a bear thesis against MSTR , citing this premium as the core reason for a long BTC, short MSTR pairs trade. (I have also discussed why such trades are probably more common than you think, and that they are actually a signal of the Bitcoin spot ETFs being not as popular as the numbers have been showing, since much of the inflows are likely for these pairs trades.) I have repeatedly argued that MSTR’s premium is justified because the shares are accretive. The BTC per share metric rises over time, even though the shares outstanding has increased. In fact, issuing shares to buy BTC will always be accretive on a BTC per share basis, if the shares trade at a premium to the underlying BTC. However, MSTR has done more than simply issue common stock. It has opportunistically used debt and convertible debt too. It also uses excess cash from business operations, although this is responsible for a fairly small amount of the BTC purchased. MSTR’s introduction of the BTC Yield KPI blatantly confirmed that this was their intention all along. Just see what Phong Le says: Management uses Bitcoin Yield to evaluate capital allocation decisions, and to measure the achievement of our bitcoin strategy. Our strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner we believe to be accretive to shareholders, thereby achieving bitcoin yield, sets us apart from institutional bitcoin investment options that charge a management fee. Here he differentiates MSTR shares and Bitcoin spot ETF shares (which he later says generates a negative BTC yield thanks to the expense ratios). While a share of an ETF always represents the same amount of BTC, a share of MSTR has experienced an increase in the amount of BTC it represents. This is accretive. It is, by their definition, a positive BTC Yield. Slides 7 and 8 showed MSTR’s historical BTC Yield. It is really quite marvelous because it means that shareholders are increasing their BTC holdings (owned via MSTR stock) by sizable numbers in each of the last few years. BTC Yield (MicroStrategy Earnings Q2 2024) Meanwhile, Slide 8 is even more noteworthy, as they are guiding for 4-8% BTC Yields for the next three years. This means management expects that every 1 BTC held via your MSTR shares can grow to 1.125 - 1.26 BTC within three years. This is pretty groundbreaking guidance. BTC Yield (MicroStrategy Earnings Q2 2024) All of this means MSTR is fully committed to pushing through the idea of accretion when measured in BTC terms. This is what getting on the Bitcoin standard partly entails: to start thinking about things in terms of BTC. Their core belief is that as long as shares represent ownership in more BTC over time, then management must be doing right by the shareholders. The introduction of the BTC Yield KPI is so important because it is like a direct response to all the accusations of the premium being unjustifiable. This is, as classily and inasmuch layman’s terms as possible, a rebuttal to the tiresome critique launched by people who are just ignorant to the economic realities or intentions of the matter. I think that as the market begins to internalize the gravity of BTC Yield, they will start to reprice MSTR in an important way. Currently, MSTR has a lot of short interest, some of which is presumably from traders who do not understand the nuances of BTC Yield and what MSTR is trying to do. What happens when some of these shorts are no longer part of the equation because they realize that there was a good reason for the premium after all? The stock would clearly reprice upwards, all else equal. Currently MSTR trades at around 2x its BTC holdings. Perhaps we could see this number go to 2.5x or even higher. MSTR has proved very effective in putting up impressive BTC Yields in the past. What multiple to NAV per share makes sense if NAV per share is expected to increase 4-8% per year over three years? That is a question the market must figure out, but so far with a lot of market participants still not getting it (because they evidently expect no premium at all), the market has settled on a 2x multiple to NAV per share. Clever Use Of Convertibles I was pretty happy to see this slide showing $3.5 billion borrowed at an weighted average rate of 1.6%, thanks largely to convertibles. Principal debt maturities. (MicroStrategy Earnings Q2 2024) I detailed the power of using convertibles to finance BTC purchases in my last Bitcoin article . Here’s the rundown: Convertible debt is debt with an equity call option attached and given to the lender. Option values are determined by implied volatility. When a company has BTC and debt on the balance sheet, its equity starts to resemble a leveraged version of BTC. Since BTC is very volatile, this means the stock has a very, very high implied volatility. That increases the value of the options embedded within the convertible debt, which justifies a lower interest rate on the convertible. This is precisely how MSTR is borrowing at under 1% interest rates to buy BTC, while the risk-free rate is 5%. In short, convertible debt plus a leveraged BTC capital structure is perfect for raising capital to buy BTC for the purpose of generating a positive BTC Yield. More BTC and more leverage makes the stock even more volatile, which lowers the interest rate of future convertibles even more. This is a vicious loop which MSTR is fully exploiting in a bid to maximize BTC Yield. Operating Business Growth MSTR runs a pretty mediocre software business. If they receive subscription revenue from their business intelligence software. Subscription revenues have grown 21% YoY, which is definitely nice, even though it did miss the revenue forecast by about 10% . Growth means that possibly more cash flows from the operating business may also be employed towards BTC Yield. Operating Business Growth (MicroStrategy Earnings Q2 2024) What I Thought Was Missing In what was very well aligned with their rebranding to the first Bitcoin Development Company 6 months ago, MSTR had launched a decentralized digital ID product over Bitcoin called MicroStrategy Orange back in April . I get that the product probably isn’t ready yet, but I would have liked to hear some info about it or some other Bitcoin-related product line they are thinking about. I think that given MSTR’s nearly cult-like following in the Bitcoin community, they are uniquely able to create products which will gain immediate brand recognition and baseline trust. This is something that few talk about in a MSTR investment thesis. A great reputation matters a lot in business, and if they are now doing development on the Bitcoin ecosystem, where plenty of work certainly needs to be done, then I would not be surprised if they push through a product which ends up being very profitable simply because the Bitcoin community wants to support them. There are, of course, marketing and public relation considerations. Bitcoin fans lean on the side of distrust and skepticism, so such a product launch still needs to be well-planned. Another thing I was looking for, though this is more of a long shot, is if they’d ever deploy the BTC treasury for economic activity besides capital preservation. Even if they lended out some BTC for an interest rate, it could generate additional income for the company. Now that there are ways to stake BTC for yield in other crypto ecosystems, I do believe that MSTR is in a unique position to massively benefit from such activities. Ultimately, any extra income from strategically deploying the BTC reserve only contributes to a higher BTC Yield KPI. Risks I think MSTR is in a very good spot. The BTC Yield KPI is, in my opinion, a landmark announcement which more companies will likely adopt as they start Bitcoin treasuries of their own. As it pertains to this thesis, the market recognition of the value of positive BTC Yield might take a long time. People may still disagree with BTC Yield as something that merits a substantial premium to the BTC holdings. Another risk is the short-term variance of BTC. It seems BTC is having trouble breaking resistance over $70,000. This lull could exist for a while, and it could cause people to reprice downwards the current 2x multiple to BTC holdings as sentiment worsens. If BTC falls, MSTR generally falls about 1.1x as much, thanks to its leveraged capital structure. All of this means that BTC’s price is ultimately a persistent risk for MSTR stock. Conclusion My opinion of MSTR has only improved after this earnings call. I view the stock as a Buy. I think the stock split will be a huge catalyst for improved liquidity, but this earnings call demonstrated that management is committed to improving the information asymmetry which seems to be making major investors hesitate on MSTR. Overall, MSTR is running a pretty incredible strategy by procuring fiat financing at very low costs of capital to purchase an extremely scarce asset which has outperformed basically everything else. Leveraging BTC allows the business to achieve superior outperformance. The goal of acquiring more BTC is very well explained in their new KPI. I look forward to seeing how this number develops over future earnings calls.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710454-all-about-that-yield-microstrategy-biggest-earnings-call-yet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32008794.jpeg

The latest market data shows MATIC took a beating with a 33% wipe in value since last week. Hostile market environment and macroeconomic fears continue to plague the broader financial world. Related Reading: Binance Coin In Turmoil: Nearly 10% Value Erased In Market Shake-Up The crypto market was not spared. The whole market depreciated by almost 17% in the past 24 hours, marking a period of strong bearish pressure. Despite the overwhelming downward trajectory the market has taken, on-chain developments continue that might slow the bearish wave, but it will take time before the price mediates back to realistic levels. More Developments Polygon’s position continues to solidify as it marks several developments that improve user experience on the platform. Messari, an independent crypto research platform, recently released its report, providing an overview of the Polygon ecosystem. In summary, the report notes several developments in the platform that occurred within the 2nd quarter of the year. Primarily, the community has reached a consensus on upgrades that will positively affect the network’s usability and performance. One of these will be the switch from MATIC to POL, which is scheduled to occur on September 4th. To attract devs to Polygon, the platform created a $1 billion Community Grants Program (CGP), supporting devs and builders of Polygon financially. According to a June blogpost, Season 1 of the CGP will feature a 35 million MATIC pool which is roughly equivalent to $12.9 million using today’s prices. Uniswap has also launched its Uniswap v3 campaign on Polygon with other $250k in rewards on Oku, a crypto trading platform. This will boost investor confidence in the platform as it shows that despite hostile market conditions, Polygon remains a major player in the DeFi space. This is seen in the current metrics the platform is running on. Nansen’s data shows an increase in active addresses and transactions in the past 24 hours, a great indicator of growth activity if it wasn’t for the air of bearishness surrounding the market. DefiLlama, on the other hand, shows the other side of the coin with major outflows on all chains under the Polygon ecosystem. MATIC: More Pain On The Way For Investors? As the market continues its painful descent, investors are poised to let go of their MATIC holdings. Recent market data shows that investors are rushing to exchanges to sell rather than hold and ride the bearish wave. This can be seen in MATIC’s price which continues to test the $0.339 support level. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Poised For Major Upswing, Analyst Forecasts $328 The market overreaction caused by cascading fears within the broader financial spectrum remains to threaten any future bullish action. As of the moment, MATIC is down to March 2021 levels, a new low after 2024’s early bull runs led by major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investors and traders should evaluate their positions to remain in the green. If possible, they can try to take advantage of the situation by shorting the token.

32003048,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633098,1722847208,"Bitcoin Price Crashes To $49,000: Key Reasons Explained","Over the past 24 hours, the crypto market has witnessed a severe downturn, with Bitcoin’s price tumbling down 15% to a low of $49,000 on Binance (BTC/USDT), marking a significant departure from its $70,000 high last week—a 26% crash. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) plunged 39% from $3,400 to $2,100. This downward trend was not isolated but echoed across the altcoin spectrum, which experienced even steeper declines. #1 Recession Fears Cause Bitcoin Crash The initial spark for the current market volatility appears to stem from intensifying fears of a US recession, triggered by unexpectedly weak US job market data on Friday. The July report showed a gain of only 114,000 jobs—significantly below the Wall Street prediction of 175,000. This was the weakest job growth since December of the previous year and nearly the lowest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments remarked via X, “Every single time the unemployment rate turns up as it has today, we have a recession. Just as the Fed was too slow to tighten in 2021, it looks like they were too slow to ease in 2024.” Further compounding the market’s nervousness was the revelation that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold about 50% of its Apple holdings. This sell-off by one of the world’s most watched investors was interpreted as a move to hedge against potential market downturns, considering Berkshire Hathaway disclosed holding a record $277 billion in cash in its Q2 report. Related Reading: Bitcoin Triple Threat: Analyst Identifies Three Signals For BTC Price Rebound Additionally, the Bank of Japan’s decision to raise its key interest rate to about 0.25% from a range of zero to about 0.1% has had significant implications. This rate hike, the second since 2007, sent shockwaves through the financial sectors globally. Historically, rate hikes by the Japanese central bank have been precursors to global recessions. Following the announcement, the Nikkei experienced its largest 2-day drop in history, surpassing even the declines seen on Black Monday in 1987. Nick Timiraos, often referred to as the “Fed’s mouthpiece” and a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, revealed, “Goldman Sachs says there are good reasons to think the rising unemployment rate in the weak-across-the-board July payroll report is less fearsome than normal…But raises its recession-probability-tracking odds to 25% from 15%.” Goldman Sachs also adjusted its expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy response, anticipating rate cuts at each upcoming meeting, with a possibility of a more aggressive 50 basis point cut if the August employment report mirrors July’s weakness. #2 Yen Carry Trade Unwind Further exacerbating the market’s fall was a significant movement in the forex markets, particularly with the Japanese yen. After the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate, the yen strengthened considerably against the US dollar. This move pressured traders who had engaged in the “yen carry trade”, borrowing yen at low rates to purchase higher-yielding US assets. Related Reading: Trump Floats Bitcoin Payments As Solution To $35 Trillion US Debt Crisis Adam Khoo noted, “The sharp rise in the JPY/USD is causing a massive unwind of yen carry trade positions and contributing to the sharp decline in US stocks.” The reversal of these trades has probably not only impacted the forex and stock markets but also had a cascading effect on Bitcoin and crypto as assets are liquidated to cover losses and repay yen-denominated liabilities. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes commented via X, “My TradFi birdies are telling me somebody big got smoked, and is dumping all #crypto. No idea if this is true, I won’t name names, but let the fam know if you are hearing the same?????” #3 Jump Trading And Large Sellers There were unusual sell orders recorded across major exchanges such as Kraken, Gemini, and Coinbase, predominantly on a Sunday, which is typically a quieter trading day. This suggests orchestrated actions by large players, potentially involving the unwinding of positions by firms like Jump Trading. Jump Trading has reportedly been involved in substantial unloading of Ethereum, amounting to about $500 million worth over the past two weeks. Market rumors suggest that the company’s sell-off could be a strategic exit from its crypto market-making ventures or an urgent need for liquidity. Ran Neuner commented via X: “I’m watching this selling by Jump Trading They are the smartest traders in world, why are they selling so fast on a Sunday with low liquidity? I would imagine they are being liquidated or have an urgent obligation.” Dr. Julian Hosp, CEO of the Cake Group, suggested on X: “The reason for the crazy crypto sell off seems to be Jump Trading, who are either getting margin called in the traditional markets and need liquidity over the weekend, or they are exiting the crypto business due to regulatory reasons (Terra Luna related). The sell-off is relentless atm.” Furthermore, Mike Alfred highlighted the possibility of distress within the market, suggesting that a large Japanese fund might have collapsed, holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum. “A big Japanese fund blew up. Unfortunately, it was holding some Bitcoin and Ethereum. Jump and other market makers sensed the distress and exacerbated the move. That’s it. Game over. On to the next one,” Alfred stated. #4 Liquidation Cascade Exacerbates Bitcoin Price Crash The market witnessed a dramatic increase in liquidations, with CoinGlass reporting that 277,937 traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours, leading to total crypto liquidations of approximately $1.06 billion. The largest single liquidation order, valued at $27 million, occurred on Huobi for a BTC-USD position. In total, $302.07 in Bitcoin longs were liquidated in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. These forced liquidations, driven by margin calls and stop-loss orders, have amplified the downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, pushing them further into the red. #5 Trump Momentum Fades Another less significant factor may involve the shifting political landscape, as Kamala Harris gains according to Polymarkets against Donald Trump (Harris 43% vs. Trump 55%). This shift is perceived negatively by the Bitcoin and crypto market. The entire market is favoring a Trump win. He wants to build a “strategic Bitcoin stockpile” and over the weekend said BTC could be used to pay off the US debt of $35 trillion. #6 Mt. Gox Distributions Still Affecting Market Liquidity Finally, the ongoing distribution of Bitcoins from the defunct Mt. Gox exchange continues to influence the market. As former users of the exchange receive and potentially sell their returned Bitcoins, this has added to the selling pressure on the market, further depressing prices. At press time, BTC bounced off the support and recovered to $52,909.

42417541,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYegH,1722846061,"Bitcoin Drops 15% Against Japanese Yen, Outpacing Declines Versus USD, as Yen Carry Trades Unwind","Bitcoin's yen-denominated price on the Tokyo-based bitFlyer exchange dropped nearly 15%, significantly more than its dollar-denominated price on Western exchanges.  This was influenced by the yen's sharp appreciation following Japan's 0.25% interest rate hike.  The yen's strong performance, rising almost 10% against the USD in three weeks, led to the unwinding of carry trades, contributing to the sell-off in risk assets, including bitcoin.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} yen-denominated price tanked nearly 15% on the Tokyo-based bitFlyer exchange, registering bigger losses than its dollar-denominated price, which fell 11%, on Western exchanges.  Trading volume on bitFlyer has surged 241% in 24 hours, topping the $220 million mark, according to Coingecko.  The steeper drop in yen terms stemmed from the Japanese currency's sharp appreciation in the foreign exchange markets. Japan raised interest rates by 0.25% last week, leading to a strong yen and a corresponding drop across risky assets including bitcoin.  The rout deepened after Tokyo opened on Monday, with markets across Asia ending the day at a loss. Japan’s Topix 100 index recorded its worst session since 2011, and Nikkei 225 was down 12.4%. Meanwhile, crypto futures traders saw their worst day since March as liquidations on crypto-tracked futures crossed the $1 billion mark in the past 24 hours.  The Japanese currency has soared nearly 10% against the USD in three weeks, a staggering increase for the world's third-biggest reserve currency and the one preferred by traders worldwide to fund purchases of risk assets.  The Bank of Japan raised rates last week, boosting the yen's appeal and triggering the unwinding of carry trades. Some say this contributed to the start of a sell-off in risk assets. Carry is a trading strategy that involves borrowing an asset or currency at a low interest rate, such as the yen, and investing in an asset that provides a higher rate of return.  “The unwind of the carry trade is more a symptom of popular macro trades being taken off, as we have seen multi-sigma moves across asset classes, and hedge funds are forced to unwind positions for PNL protection,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA.org, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “Japan has been a source of PNL income from USDJPY longs and Nikkei longs, so the unwinding of these main sources is likely to suggest very muted risk sentiment and risk appetite going forward,” Fan added.  Some remain optimistic, however, and suggest that the market could be making a local bottom in the coming days.  “The recent pullback resulted from the broader market tightening in Japan's economic policies, where the central bank’s hawkish stance shifted to surprisingly raise interest rates,” Lucy Hu, senior analyst at Metalpha, explained in a Telegram message. “The bearish macro data in the U.S. sent investors worrying about a possible recession.”  “However, despite no formal confirmation of a rate cut by the Fed in Sep, the market has priced in the event and we should expect a rebound in BTC price when the macro environment improves,” Hu added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Shaurya Malwa, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/05/bitcoin-drops-15-against-japanese-yen-outpacing-declines-versus-usd-as-yen-carry-trades-unwind,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23048332251b1c1e1cd0242070cf6c5bceae92d0-1500x1002.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Think again. There's some serious carnage out there, and the fallout is quickly spreading across the globe. Investors can really use some soothing words from central bankers right now, especially from a Fed that's being seen as falling behind the curve (remember how things went for markets in 2022?). A disappointing jobs report on Friday indicated that Powell and Co. should have likely cut rates at their July gathering last week, and sentiment has quickly shifted from a soft to a hard landing- or even an emergency landing. Flashing red: Monday's bloodbath started in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 Index ( NKY:IND ) plunged 13.2% for its worst session since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown. Adding to the concerns were the BOJ's steps toward policy normalization, and it has translated into Japan's world-beating rally this year being wiped out over the last several sessions. Circuit breakers were also activated for South Korea's Kospi ( KOSPI ) after the index rapidly dropped 8% , while Australia's ASX 200 ( AS51 ) slid nearly 4% for its worst session since June 2022. Major market indices like the FTSE 100 ( UKX ), CAC 40 ( CAC:IND ) and DAX ( DAX:IND ) also tumbled in Europe, and over in the U.S., traders are also set to open the week by pressing the panic button. S&P 500 ( SP500 ) futures are off by 3% at the time of writing, while contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) are down by a whopping 5.7% . The index already fell into correction territory last week following an overheated AI rally, and news that Berkshire's Warren Buffett sold off half of his massive stake in Apple has not helped the situation for tech stocks. Safe havens like gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) and bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) are also failing to catch a bid as the sell-everything mentality takes hold and no one appears willing to catch a falling knife just yet. That's not all. Rising geopolitical tensions aren't making the investing landscape any better, with President Biden meeting with his national security team in the situation room ahead of an anticipated Iranian attack against Israel. It could also include a coordinated front with Hezbollah in Lebanon and/or the Houthis in Yemen, in a serious escalation that could begin as early as Monday. Fears of a regional conflict have prompted the U.S. to deploy additional military might in the Middle East, including a carrier strike group, as well as a new squadron of fighter aircraft. SA commentary: With the next Fed gathering over six weeks away, a recent call from Investing Group Leader David Lerner may not be looking all that contrarian. "" Cutting rates in August is less disruptive and adds to the Fed's credibility,"" he explained, saying that an inter-meeting reduction of 25 basis points would counteract faltering employment and can prevent an immediate 50 bps cut or even 75. ""This will of course roil stocks, which the Fed officially doesn't care about (but really does).""

In fact, the altcoin has appeared on this analyst’s radar, and for good reasons. An optimistic analysis by trader WHALES_CRYPTOx brings Solana back in the spotlight. According to the trader’s observations, SOL is about to see a huge price increase, which has investors and experts talking. However, what does this signify for Solana’s future? Related Reading: Binance Coin In Turmoil: Nearly 10% Value Erased In Market Shake-Up Overcoming Obstacles The price movement of Solana in the last several days has been quite erratic. Despite this, the cryptocurrency, according to WHALES_CRYPTOx, has emerged from a bullish pennant formation on the weekly chart, a technical pattern sometimes linked to significant higher rises. This breakthrough is especially significant since it comes after Solana successfully broke through the resistance level of $120, which had previously prevented its climb. 💰 #SOL/USDT released the breakout off the bullish pennant on weekly🔥 Send it✈️ 👇Crypto Traders-join Telegram👇 https://t.co/caOlZBzS3k . pic.twitter.com/o3ZhmTYc5a — Whales_Crypto_Trading 🐋 (@WHALES_CRYPTOx) August 4, 2024 The trader highlights that this breakout points to further buying pressure, which might create a new support level near $120. This change is significant since it indicates that the market’s perception of Solana is improving. The prognosis also identifies significant Fibonacci retracement levels, and the fact that the price is now above the 0.618 level suggests that there may be further increases ahead. Solana: Strength Indicators The 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has been a reliable source of support for Solana throughout its current consolidation period, which strengthens the bullish thesis. SOL’s sustained presence above this crucial metric supports the idea that the rising trend will continue. With his crystal ball seeing the $328.60 level, WHALES_CRYPTOx has his eyes glued on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. This objective signifies a potential bounce-back from the altcoin’s present trading price of approximately $143.40. The analyst, however, warns that short-term volatility may present some challenges, particularly in light of recent trading numbers that show a 5% retreat in price and a 26.32% reduction in trading volume over the previous day. A Mixed Bag Of Opinion On The Market The recent decline in trade metrics adds a degree of concern even if the technical indicators show a positive picture. This narrative makes us wonder: Is Solana ready for a real breakthrough, or are we just seeing a passing fad of interest? Bullish indications are strong, but they need to be considered in the context of the actual state of the market since the cryptocurrency market is infamously volatile. Meanwhile, with an expected price increase of 2.72% over the next three months, Solana could be be affordable for the time being. Still, looking further out, traders should anticipate a solid 81.31% growth rate over the next six months, so things are looking good. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Drops 23%, But Recent Devs Might Slow The Trend The Road Ahead For Solana Solana’s potential is growing, but the cryptocurrency industry is divided.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value has crashed over 18% to $50,000 in 24 hours, reaching its lowest level since February 2024. The sell-off, which is part of broad-based risk aversion in global markets, is likely caused by the sharp rise in the anti-risk Japanese yen and the U.S. bond market shenanigans.  According to Velo Data, the annualized three-month futures premium on leading crypto exchange Binance has dropped to 3.32%, the lowest since April 2023. Crypto exchanges OKX and Deribit are seeing a similar slide in futures premiums.

The crypto fear and greed index flashed ""fear"" and fell to its lowest level in a month.  The CoinDesk 20 Index dropped nearly 20%.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} extended its slump during Asian trading hours on Monday, plunging below $50,000 before recovering to around $51,000, still the lowest level since mid-February, as rising tensions in the Middle East and concerns about the strength of the global economy ate into investor confidence.  The world's largest cryptocurrency fell for a fourth straight day, dropping to as low as $49,112, data from TradingView show. Ether {{ETH}}, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, sank to as little as $2,060, the least since Jan. 3. The CoinDesk 20 index, which tracks some of the most liquid non-stablecoin tokens, dropped nearly 20%.  Ether's near 25% slide is the worst single-day hit for the token since May 2021. The sell-off in ether was catalyzed by rumors of crypto market maker Jump Trading's liquidating assets. On-chain sleuth spotonchain identified a wallet supposedly belonging to Jump Trading that transferred 17,576 ETH, worth over $46 million, to centralized exchanges, a sign of possible liquidation.  The bloodbath led to over $1 billion in liquidations in the crypto futures market, with ether registering over $350 million in liquidated bets, a rare oddity.  The panic selling in bitcoin and the overall crypto market has been triggered by a wider fall in financial markets as fears of a global recession and rising tensions in the Middle East had investors hitting the panic button. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped 12.4%, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell more than 3% and micro futures on the S&P 500 Index lost 3.3%.  This has led to the crypto fear and greed sentiment index flashing “fear,” and reaching its lowest level since early July. The index tracks volatility, prices, and social media data to indicate whether participants are fearful – usually a sign of local bottoms – or greedy, which marks market tops.  As if in anticipation, investors pulled $237.5 million from U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Friday, the most since May 1, according to data from SoSoValue. Ether ETFs were hit with $54.3 million of net outflows. Across the broader crypto market, digital asset investments ended four weeks of net inflows with outflows of $528 million last week, CoinShares said in its weekly report. Bitcoin assets lost $400 million and ether $146 million. CoinShares attributed the withdrawals to concerns of a U.S. recession and the geopolitical environment.

Over 200,000 traders were liquidated, with the largest single liquidation order worth $27 million on Huobi.  Bitcoin and ether prices fell, with ether experiencing its steepest single-day drop since May 2021, and the crypto fear and greed index indicating ""fear.""  Crypto-tracked futures recorded over $1 billion in liquidations in the past 24 hours as the market sell-off worsened on Sunday. The bloodbath was catalyzed by a stronger Japanese yen and rumors of market maker Jump Trading liquidating its crypto business.  Ether {{ETH}} tracked futures recorded over $340 million in liquidated bets, data shows, with bitcoin futures losses leading at $420 million. Futures tracking Solana’s SOL, dogecoin {{DOGE}}, xrp {{XRP}} and pepe (PEPE) took on $75 million in cumulative liquidations.  Over 275,000 individual traders were liquidated, and the largest single liquidation order was on crypto exchange Huobi – a BTC/USD trade worth $27 million. The data shows that some 87% of all traders affected were long traders, or those that bet on higher prices.  The liquidations came as bitcoin {{BTC}} slid more than 11% over 24 hours, while ether plunged as much as 25% before slightly recovering. TradingView data shows this was the worst single-day price fall for ETH since May 2021, when prices dumped from over $3,500 to $1,700. TradingView's daily candle shows performance for UTC 00:00 to 23:59.  The drop caused the popular crypto fear and greed sentiment index to flash “fear,” reaching its lowest level since early July. The index tracks volatility, prices, and social media data to indicate whether participants are fearful—usually a sign of local bottoms—or greedy, which marks market tops.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is, they don't have enough funds to keep the trade open.  Crypto markets started to sell off last week amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and poor earnings reports by technology firms. These factors dampened the artificial intelligence (AI) hype among investors and created a flight away from risky assets.  The rout worsened early Monday as the yen surged to seven-month highs due to heightened expectations of further rate hikes by the Bank of Japan and the unwinding of carry trades.

The price is trading below the $0.100 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1000 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to move down unless it reclaims the $0.100 resistance zone. Dogecoin Price Drops Over 15% In the past few sessions, Dogecoin price saw a major decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The bears took control and pushed the price below the $0.1120 and $0.1050 support levels. The price even declined below the $0.1000 support. A low was formed at $0.0881 and DOGE price is now consolidating losses. The price is showing many bearish signs below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1194 swing high to the $0.0881 low. Dogecoin is now trading below the $0.100 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.0950 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1000 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1000 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. A close above the $0.100 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1040 resistance or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1194 swing high to the $0.0881 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1080 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1120. More Downsides In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to recover above the $0.1000 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.0880 level. The next major support is near the $0.0850 level. The main support sits at $0.0780. If there is a downside break below the $0.0780 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.0720 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

The price is now trading below $0.4880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.550 resistance or even $0.5650 in the near term. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $0.520 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.4650 level. The next major support is at $0.460.

31992952,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633078,1722832189,Bitcoin Price Plunge Deepens: What Could Prevent a Recovery?,"Bitcoin price declined further below the $55,000 support zone. BTC is down over 15% and might even slide toward the $50,000 zone. Bitcoin gained bearish momentum below the $56,500 and $55,000 support levels. The price is trading below $55,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $56,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might start a decent recovery wave if it clears the $58,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Nosedives Bitcoin price extended losses below the $56,500 support zone. BTC even traded below the $55,000 and $54,500 levels. A low is formed near $52,430 and the price is now consolidating losses. It recovered above the $53,500 level and tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $61,040 swing high to the $52,430 low. However, the price is now struggling to clear the $55,000 resistance zone. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $56,700 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is trading below $55,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $55,500 level. The first key resistance is near the $56,800 level. A clear move above the $56,800 resistance might send the price further higher in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $58,000 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $61,040 swing high to the $52,430 low. The next major hurdle sits at $58,800. A close above the $58,800 resistance might spark bullish moves. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $60,000 resistance. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to recover above the $56,800 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $53,000 level. The first major support is $52,500. The next support is now near $52,000. Any more losses might send the price toward the $50,000 support zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 30 level. Major Support Levels – $53,000, followed by $52,500. Major Resistance Levels – $56,800, and $58,000.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-plunge-53k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The action in Japan spread to the U.S., where the Nasdaq slid more than 5% in last week's final two sessions. Nasdaq futures are lower by 2.5% in Sunday evening action.  In addition to the Bank of Japan's somewhat unexpected hawkishness last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve also surprised a few – not by holding rates steady, but instead by appearing somewhat ambivalent about cutting rates in September, which nearly all market participants assumed was a sure thing.  Whether the Fed made a policy error remains to be seen, but markets are setting their own agenda at the moment. Traders have priced in a 100% chance of lower U.S. base rates in September, with a 71% chance of 50 basis points in rate cuts and just a 29% chance of a 25 basis point move.  Looking further out on the maturity curve, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has tumbled to 3.75% on Sunday evening versus 4.25% just one week ago and a full 150-175 basis points less than the current fed funds target of 5.25%-5.50%.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,ASIA | BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/05/bitcoin-tumbles-to-53k-ether-turns-negative-for-2024-as-panic-grips-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/385e67af4cf91ca8661ff8e6cc3c60373ea5bc18-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
