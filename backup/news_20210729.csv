42407047,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf96rg,1627600463,Colombia's First Commercial Bank Will Let Users Transfer Money to Crypto Exchange,"Banco de Bogot√°, the first commercial bank to be established in Colombia, plans to test allowing deposits and withdrawals with a crypto exchange.      As part of a government-sponsored pilot program to test banking services for crypto platforms, Banco de Bogot√° will allow bank customers to send and withdraw money from Chilean crypto exchange Buda.com in August, said Alejandro Beltr√°n, Colombia country manager for Buda.com.      Although the service is scheduled to start early in the month, both parties are still defining the terms and conditions of the contract, Beltr√°n told CoinDesk.      ""Banco de Bogot√° has been very detailed and careful in this process, which is understandable since it is entering a new world and they want to understand it in all its dimensions,"" the executive said.      In January, Colombia‚Äôs financial watchdog, the Financial Superintendency of Colombia (SFC), announced that nine crypto firms (out of 14 applicants) were chosen to test banking services for crypto platforms as part of a yearlong project.      The agreement between Buda.com and Banco de Bogot√° would be the second to be launched. Crypto exchange Bitpoint started operating with Colombian fintech Movii this month, along with crypto exchange Panda.      Banco de Bogot√° will also operate with Mexican crypto exchange Bitso, although that partnership has not yet started either, Beltr√°n said.      Among the nine exchanges chosen by the SFC is Binance, which will operate with Colombian bank Davivienda and fintech Powwi, while Gemini plans to operate with Bancolombia.      Until the adoption of the pilot program, banks had restricted money transfers to crypto exchanges because of financial regulations, although people have been making them without specifying that they were crypto operations, Beltr√°n said.      While the pilot program isn‚Äôt intended to lead to new regulations, it will allow exchanges to work with large banks that have broad coverage and more experience, said Beltr√°n, who added that it also allows the SFC to understand how the crypto industry works.      The Colombian government launched a ""regulatory sandbox"" last September to expand its fintech regulatory testing environment, while regulators have issued crypto tax guidelines as well as anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.      Banco de Bogot√° also began a pilot program to examine crypto asset-related business models earlier this year.      Beltr√°n said the pilot program is not part of the regulatory sandbox and does not look to regulate the industry.

13223218,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=468372,1627599615,Why Another Wave Up For Altcoins Is Probable According To BTC Dominance,"BTC dominance has always had an inverse effect on the price movements for altcoins. Historically, BTC dominance determines the direction the value of altcoins swings in. Bitcoin has so far maintained majority dominance on the market. But as more time passes, that dominance goes down as altcoins see more demand. BTC dominance simply shows how much demand there is for bitcoin compared to altcoins. The more BTC dominance rises, the lower the demand for altcoins. This means that for altcoins to rally up further, bitcoin demand has to go down. Related Reading | Ethereum Breaks 200,000 Validators Milestone, Over $14 Billion Now Staked In ETH 2.0 Over the years, this dominance has decreased as more and more investors put money in altcoins. One reason for this being a lot of investors feel they have missed the boat with bitcoin and thus are trying to get in early enough on altcoins. Others revolve around the new technological advancements being made by altcoin projects. Hence, investors are putting money into projects that they believe in. How Current BTC Dominance Affects Altcoins BTC dominance has continually declined over the past couple of months. Currently sitting at 48.97% dominance, bitcoin now has less than half of the entire market dominance. This trend shows that demand for altcoins is on the rise.

42407036,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf96hq,1627594720,A Play-to-Earn Account Beats a Bank Account,"It may be lauded as the hallmark of financial inclusion, but a bank account represents very little for those that don‚Äôt have one yet. Even for the privileged ones who have access, an account alone does not necessarily qualify its holder to access a competitive interest-bearing savings account, a loan or insurance coverage ‚Äì that is, all the types of products and services that could actually help someone improve his or her financial position and economic status in this world.    Beryl Li is co-founder of Yield Guild Games.    I am from the Philippines, born and raised, and over here just 23% of adults have a bank account. According to a 2017 study on financial inclusion by our central bank, the main reason cited by respondents was they just didn‚Äôt have enough money to need one. For the vast majority of people here, who earn little more than US$300 a month, a bank account is just seen as a thing with expensive fees that eats away at your balance for no good reason.      I have always believed there should be opportunities for people to invest and create wealth by contributing other valuable economic resources such as time and skill, even where they have zero money to begin with. Thinking in purely monetary terms is such an archaic way to look at the value that people can bring to an economy, especially as digital infrastructure is lowering accessibility barriers and making inclusion goals more attainable than ever before.      During my time as Entrepreneur in Residence in the very earliest days at Coins.ph, a Philippine crypto exchange and mobile wallet founded in 2014 that serves over 10 million customers today, we did a lot to establish the necessary payment rails that would allow Filipinos to get in and out of crypto. For example, an unbanked person could deposit pesos into their e-wallet at their local 7-Eleven, and from there the user could buy mobile data or pay bills electronically. The person also enjoyed improved efficiency for local and international remittances, with crypto-asset backed transfers costing far less in time and money than the traditional options. At the time this was revolutionary, and the metric of impact measurement that we displayed at our website was the number of hours we‚Äôd saved people from waiting in line to make in-person payments.    Read more: How Axie Infinity Creates Work in the Metaverse | Leah Callon-Butler    Of course, users could also buy and sell crypto via our mobile app, and still today there are many who say their first-ever experience with investing was thanks to Coins.ph. While this has allowed Filipinos to take significant steps toward their financial freedom, there is still more to do. Because for all these aforementioned opportunities presented by crypto-based economies, users must have upfront capital in order to participate. And in a place where roughly a fifth of the population lives below the poverty line, that‚Äôs going to be an insurmountable hurdle for many.      This is why the play-to-earn phenomenon in non-fungible token (NFT) gaming is so powerful, because users don‚Äôt need to put money in ‚Äì they can earn it through active participation in a video game. This is providing unprecedented access to wealth creation opportunities in crypto, especially in developing countries where we‚Äôve seen a huge influx of people wanting to get in on the craze. But rising demand has dramatically increased the cost of the NFTs needed to play the game. Which places us right back where we started, with expensive admission fees putting play-to-earn games out of reach for those who could benefit from them the most.      This exact problem is what inspired my co-founders and me to establish Yield Guild Games (YGG). With the vision to onboard millions of players to the metaverse, we began investing in yield-bearing NFTs in the most promising play-to-earn games, for the purpose of lending those assets to our guild members as an uncollateralized loan. The players are entitled to 70% of what they earn in-game, while 20% goes to the Community Manager who is responsible for recruiting and onboarding players to be competitive. The remaining 10% goes back to YGG to cover the costs associated with acquiring the assets, including gas fees, and ensuring their safe custody.    Ultimately, play-to-earn games represent a chance for people to become more than the financial situation they were born into.    The model is not only popular, it is successful. To date, our guild has onboarded 3,300 new players and collectively earned over 27 million SLP (that‚Äôs the reward token earned by players of Axie Infinity). At today‚Äôs prices, those tokens are worth around US$7.29 million. And at this point, it‚Äôs important to note that these are not your average startup growth metrics. These numbers represent thousands of lives that have significantly improved because of the guild‚Äôs efforts in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Venezuela and Brazil.      This is redefining what it means to ‚Äúspend time‚Äù in-game. In the past, a game account was something that gobbled up hours of time for little return. But now with NFT games, a player‚Äôs time and skill has real-world ROI, generating income and contributing to wealth creation, breaking the curse of poverty and the cycle of debt. It then becomes a vehicle to provide other relevant financial services as well as financial education. Ultimately, play-to-earn games represent a chance for people to become more than the financial situation they were born into.    Read more: Ripple On-Demand Liquidity Corridor Opens Between Japan and Philippines    Yield Guild is already making yield-generating NFTs accessible for its members. Next could be more accessible crypto borrowing, particularly to individuals and businesses in developing countries with fewer tangible assets to address typical collateral requirements and provide access to capital that is not being served in these markets. Data from their wallet activity, such as hours spent playing and in-game rewards earned, could be used to inform alternative credit scoring models, making players eligible to apply for other forms of non-collateralized loans.      This new intersection between gaming and finance is completely subverting the way we think about financial participation and wealth creation. More than banking the unbanked, play-to-earn is a system that rewards and propels time and skill as opposed to privilege. Through the gamified experience, communities can generate an income, reinvest their earnings and elevate their economic status. What‚Äôs more, these NFT games can be a gateway to accessing alternative financial services and a module for improving financial literacy. Also, they make learning, earning and investing fun.

The cryptocurrency is up about 23% over the past week, a gain driven by improving sentiment and short covering.      Some analysts expect bitcoin to remain range-bound as the current rally takes a breather.      ‚ÄúOur sense is that the market will keep looking to trade within this $30K-$40K range in the near term,‚Äù wrote QCP Capital in a Telegram chat. ‚ÄúInto Friday‚Äôs month-end expiry, we expect $40K-$42K to hold as the open interest peaks here.‚Äù    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin¬†(BTC) $39711.8, -1.45%  Ether¬†(ETH) $2312.1, +0.2%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500:¬†4419.1, +0.42%  Gold: $1828.2, +1.21%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.273%, compared with 1.233% on Wednesday    ‚ÄúPrice levels to consider are the $40,000 psychological price level, and $44,000, which is the next resistance level BTC saw when Tesla announced they would accept BTC as payment back in February,‚Äù Jeffrey Wang, head of Americas at Amber Group, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      In the bitcoin options market, ‚Äúthere is not much open interest between the $45,000 and $50,000 strikes for the August expiry,‚Äù Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""We can see sharp moves here.""      Bitcoin is up about 35% year to date, double the S&P 500‚Äôs 17% gain over the same period. Both bitcoin and stocks are beating gold‚Äôs 5% loss year to date.    Bitcoin open interest    ‚ÄúBitcoin open interest has also been picking up, breaking above its June highs and retesting support,‚Äù Stack Funds, a Singapore-based crypto asset management firm, wrote in a newsletter Thursday. (See chart below.)      ‚ÄúOur expectations for a retest towards the mid/low $20K region is less likely,‚Äù Stack Funds wrote. The firm mentioned that a clear breakout in open interest is required in order to signal further upside in bitcoin.    Risk management    Although bitcoin remains in a secular bull market, the cryptocurrency has fallen by a minimum of 25% once in every calendar year since 2013, according to Panxora, a crypto investment firm.      ‚ÄúOften that fall averages more than 40% and this kind of drawdown makes cryptocurrency a challenging investment for those that have no way to manage this kind of volatility risk,‚Äù Panxora wrote on its website.      When managing risk, crypto investors can consider macro conditions such as economic growth and inflation, which tend to influence the prices of assets in both traditional and crypto markets.      ‚ÄúI think inflation fears will reemerge,‚Äù Gavin Smith, CEO of Panxora, said in an interview with CoinDesk. ‚ÄúAnd I think that will be the catalyst for a true move in the cryptocurrency, certainly bitcoin‚Äôs over the next six to nine months.      ‚ÄúFrom a longer-term perspective, I'm quite bullish on the environment, because what we've seen in the downturn is really people pulling away from the inflation narrative that we saw,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúPersonally, I think it's too early to pull away from that.‚Äù      Smith said that Panxora and other institutions he spoke to are ‚Äúentering the buy zone.‚Äù      ‚ÄúEven if they're long-term bullish on bitcoin, what they do is they wait for these frequent sell-offs,"" Smith said. ""And then they use that to start accumulating their holdings, rather than chasing the market higher.‚Äù    Altcoin roundup  Paxos discloses more investors: Paxos ‚Äì a provider of blockchain infrastructure ‚Äì said Bank of America, crypto exchange FTX, Founders Fund and Coinbase Ventures were among a heavyweight list of investors in its $300 million Series D funding round, the firm disclosed on Thursday. Oak HC/FT led the funding round, which the nine-year-old company announced in late April at a valuation of $2.4 billion. The round also included PayPal Ventures and Mithril Capital, among others. The firm has raised more than $540 million over multiple funding rounds.  Traders bearish on AXS: Even though AXS, the governance token of Axie Infinity, has logged a year-to-date price return of over 7,000%, compared with bitcoin‚Äôs roughly 33% return and ether‚Äôs 212% return, some crypto traders are bearish toward the token. ‚ÄúThe euphoric-herd mentality pushed the valuation to extremes, and as with any overcrowded trade, once the unwind takes place, the price swings will be extremely volatile,‚Äù Denis Vinokourov, head of research at London-based quantitative finance management firm Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk‚Äôs Muyao Shen. ‚ÄúThe problem is market timing ‚Äì timing the top of the market ‚Äì is notoriously difficult.‚Äù  FET Volatility: The price of Fetch.ai‚Äôs native token (FET) has endured a roller-coaster run over the last 24 hours following its listing on the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase on Wednesday. It is not unusual for a coin being listed on one of the world‚Äôs best-known exchanges. Often dubbed the ‚ÄúCoinbase Effect,‚Äù the phenomenon is when a cryptocurrency experiences a sharp uptick in price preceding and following its listing. After the listing, though, a crypto‚Äôs price tends to cool as speculative traders look to cash in on the hype surrounding the crypto‚Äôs new home.  Ethereum‚Äôs ‚ÄòEnterprise‚Äô Play: As Ethereum celebrates its sixth anniversary, Joe Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum and the CEO of ConsenSys, says the convergence between the public mainnet and corporate versions of the technology are now closer than ever. Lubin, who spoke today at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) anniversary event alongside Ethereum chief scientist Vitalik Buterin and Web 3.0 leader and angel investor Balaji Srinivasan, pointed to cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) now entering pop culture.

42407051,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf96vc,1627586889,Blockchain Data Shows Bitcoin's Current Price Floor at $37.3K,"Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has a price floor now of around $37,300, Chainalysis wrote Thursday in its latest market report. The blockchain data firm wrote that the market is holding the price floor well as demand from existing whale investors (large bitcoin holders) has returned.      ‚ÄúSo demand is returning to the market,‚Äù the report concluded. ‚ÄúSupply, which has become more liquid since prices fell in May, is only as liquid as it was in December 2020. This all suggests the market is at least in a sideways state and is unlikely to enter an extreme price fall phase.‚Äù      Chainalysis estimates a temporary bitcoin price floor by calculating the average cost of bitcoin held by investors who entered the market in the past 12 months. Getting the data is possible because of blockchain's transparency.      At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at 39,667.50, down 2.13% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Unlike the case in traditional markets, bitcoin‚Äôs price gains and losses have been concentrated in a short period of time, Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, wrote in the report. Data shows that since last year, 75% of bitcoin‚Äôs absolute price gains occurred in just 25% of the days when its price closed in green. A similar trend also occurs for bitcoin‚Äôs absolute losses.      That differs from traditional markets such as the S&P 500, where gains or losses are more equally distributed. For example, a little more than 75% of the S&P 500‚Äôs gains took place in more than 50% of the days.      Therefore, according to Gradwell, the so-called on-chain price floor is an essential metric for crypto traders and analysts to understand bitcoin‚Äôs market, which can be become extremely volatile in a short period of time.      ‚ÄúIf an investor buys bitcoin at $40,000 and continues to hold, then we know that they value bitcoin at least at $40,000,‚Äù Gradwell wrote. ‚ÄúIf the price were to go below $40,000, then it would be below their valuation and they may buy more.‚Äù      The chart below also shows that the on-chain price floor is a better indicator than the 200- and 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the price to hint when a bull run may end.      Crypto traders and analysts have long been watching the ‚Äúdeath cross‚Äù ‚Äì the intersection of the 50-day moving average below the 200-day moving average ‚Äì as a key technical indicator of a shift from a bull market to a bearish one.      But during the bull runs in late 2017 and this April, for example, the on-chain price floor flattened both times ahead of the appearance of a ‚Äúdeath cross,‚Äù making it a ‚Äúleading‚Äù indicator of a change in market trends.      ‚ÄúThe on-chain price floor stops increasing the moment that investors stop buying in a price rally,‚Äù the report said, showing that a decline in bitcoin demand would soon lead to a bearish market trend.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/29/blockchain-data-shows-bitcoins-current-price-floor-at-373k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74dcbd5bd8203f7be381d8f9f13ca00964d61d63-1200x570.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407037,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf96ip,1627585268,Parsing 3 Types of Risk in Digital Assets,"To earn a return, one must take risks. Even the theoretical ‚Äúrisk-free rate‚Äù ‚Äì calculated by subtracting the current inflation rate from the yield of the Treasury bond matching the investment duration ‚Äì carries risk. Those risks include counterparty risk (in the event of a U.S. government default), currency risk (in the case of foreign investments) or a miscalculation of inflation.  In traditional markets, the yield one can potentially earn is typically commensurate with the risk taken ‚Äì the greater the risk, the greater the potential return and potential loss. In digital assets, high yields are ubiquitous, but it‚Äôs not always clear what risks are actually taken to generate these yields.    Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca, where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management.    So why do high yields exist in digital assets, and how are they generated? To answer that, we need to explore the three different types of risk that currently exist in the market.    Counterparty risk ‚Äì the risk that the principal will not be returned due to the health and solvency of the party that holds the assets.  Duration/reinvestment risk ‚Äì the risk that yields will be lower at the expiration of an investment  Directional risk ‚Äì the risk that the price of the underlying asset declines  Counterparty risk    Two of the most well-known and heavily discussed yield opportunities come from the basis trade (‚Äúcash and carry‚Äù) and stablecoin lending (e.g., staking USDT with a decentralized finance [DeFi] platform). These yields, which can range from 5% to 40% annually, largely exist because of an industry-wide working capital deficiency.¬†Unlike traditional markets where there is too much cash in the market and a single prime broker can help one execute across any and all venues, in digital assets there is often not enough cash to navigate a fragmented and dislocated market.      For example, to buy just $1 million of assets, one might need $3 million-$5 million of cash to ensure there is enough buying power spread out across different venues, as the best offer might only appear in one place. Similarly, market makers require cash to facilitate trading at each of these venues. This cash shortage creates demand for dollars, which in turn leads to high lending yields and often higher prices for derivatives that require lower cash collateral. But these yields are not risk-free. Both lending and spot/futures arbitrage introduce counterparty risk.    Read more: Fundamental Investing Is Alive and Well in Crypto | Jeff Dorman    The counterparty can be an exchange, an over-the-counter (OTC) dealer, a technology provider, a DeFi protocol or one of the interest-bearing quasi-banks. The recent bankruptcy case of Cred Capital is a stark reminder of how great these risks can be. Back in 2008-2009, after the demise of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, investing became less about what you owned and more about who you owned it with. This same dynamic occurred again in 2011-2012, when brokerages like Knight Capital, MF Global and Jefferies teetered on the brink of insolvency (with MF Global filing).      All risks can be managed, including counterparty risk, when one properly identifies the risks and conducts proper due diligence. But not understanding the risk taken can be costly.    Reinvestment risk    Would you prefer a 10% fixed return locked in for one year or a 20% fixed return locked in for one month? To properly assess, one must have a view on what rates will be one month from now. While the 20% yield sounds much better, if rates plummet to 1% by the time that instrument matures you are now faced with 11 months of lower returns that could have been avoided had you locked in the lower rate.¬†When hunting for the best rates, understanding this duration and reinvestment risk matters a great deal.      Every yield instrument has a maturity. Whether you are buying a bond, lending an asset, taking out a home mortgage, doing an arbitrage trade with a lockup or trading an options or futures curve, these investments have a shelf life. As such, investors need to have an opinion on forward-looking rate opportunities regardless of how attractive is the current environment. With digital assets these rates are highly volatile and are dependent on outside factors such as how much leverage is in the market, new participants entering and existing, and new tokens with inflationary incentive mechanisms built in as marketing costs to attract customers. All of these factors determine the forward-looking rate environment, and managing that duration risk is imperative to generating stable returns.    Directional risk    While lending stablecoins and basis trading carry both counterparty and duration risk, these two strategies often carry little, if any, price risk.¬†These are truly market-neutral strategies.¬†But there are plenty of other ways to earn yield that do require a directional market view. MicroStrategy, the first publicly traded company to invest heavily in bitcoin, recently raised $500 million in a secured bond deal at a 6.125% coupon. While that coupon is fixed, the yield an investor earns is variable because the price of the bond may go up or down over the lifespan of the bond, thereby increasing or decreasing the total return of the investment beyond the 6.125% coupon.      Similarly, yield farming, selling options, staking and acting as a liquidity provider all come with some degree of price risk.¬†While the yield itself from these strategies may be fixed or variable, ultimately the underlying assets one must hold to participate in these strategies can move up or down.    Read more: How Activist Investors Can Help the Digital Assets Industry Mature | Jeff Dorman    Like all risks, there is nothing wrong with taking directional risk, as long as the risk is understood. For example, yield farming still offers tremendously high yields because these protocols and applications are essentially giving out quasi-equity in the form of inflationary token rewards to help bootstrap customer growth and network participation. The yield itself is a nice kicker, but ultimately the decision to farm or not is a bet on the growth of the platform itself.¬†Should the platform succeed, the native token with which you‚Äôre earning rewards will perform well.      For example, imagine if early adopters of Amazon Prime received more Prime membership rewards, and delivery persons, frequent shoppers or merchants who provided discounts could earn even more rewards. If Amazon works, Prime membership becomes more valuable and now you can sell your excess Prime memberships that were gifted to you (see my previous CoinDesk article about this). That‚Äôs yield farming, and that‚Äôs also directional risk.    Conclusion    All three of these types of risk can be mitigated, and managed, if properly understood. But it should also come as no surprise that the yields available via various digital strategies are much higher than yields that can be earned in traditional finance.    The counterparties are all brand new, and therefore much riskier. More risk = potentially higher yields.  The volatility of the asset class means reinvestment risk is greater. More risk = potentially higher yields.  The future path of most digital asset projects is more uncertain, and thus directional risk is greater. More risk = potentially higher yields.    While yields may have compressed in the short run as speculative fervor has temporarily paused, until this market matures further higher risk/higher reward opportunities are not going to go away.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Dorman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/29/parsing-3-types-of-risk-in-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/266d33dcea89e84298e940025b8674b27b48da3f-1400x912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407049,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf96ud,1627583834,The Metaverse's Emerging Economics,"While Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are trying to get off the Earth, Mark Zuckerberg has his sights set on a different escape.      In an interview with the Verge, he tells us of Facebook‚Äôs plans to contribute to the ""metaverse"" ‚Äì a development rooted in the company's Oculus virtual reality division, but also connected to the DNA of social networks and identity. (For prior reading, see our essay here, interview with Outlier Ventures here or their full thesis, and Matthew Ball‚Äôs essays here.) The full discussion is worth reading, but here are some of the juiciest bits for us:    It‚Äôs not enough to just build something that people like to use. It has to create opportunity and broadly be a positive thing for society in terms of economic opportunity, in terms of being something that, socially, everyone can participate in, that it can be inclusive‚Ä¶ This isn‚Äôt just a product that we‚Äôre building. It needs to be an ecosystem. So the creators who we work with, the developers, they all need to be able to not only sustain themselves, but hire a lot of folks.And this is something that I hope eventually millions of people will be working in and creating content for ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs experiences, or spaces, or virtual goods, or virtual clothing, or doing work helping to curate and introduce people to spaces and keep it safe.    According to Zuck, the metaverse is a more integrated media internet. Instead of living inside your small phone or staring at a flat Zoom screen, you embody and inhabit social spaces that are rendered in your mind by technology. These spaces are places you are, augmented with interfaces, or places you go, teleporting your avatar into work and play environments.      To any sci-fi reader, all this is familiar stuff. And we are getting there very slowly through gaming, with about three million headsets connected to Steam in mid-2021.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his¬†Fintech Blueprint¬†newsletter.    There is no discussion of the internet of value, of blockchain-based money and software. Given that Libra/Diem ended up as a collateralized USD bank money, perhaps deeper fintech and DeFi (decentralized finance) metaverse platforms are still under wraps. Or perhaps that is something for those other, non-Facebook metaverse participants to bring to the table. Zuck says this global community must be open-source and interoperable, connected to thousands of third-party actors, and it can and will not be built by a single player alone. It is multiplayer by default:    I think a good vision for the metaverse is not one that a specific company builds, but it has to have the sense of interoperability and portability. You have your avatar and your digital goods, and you want to be able to teleport anywhere. You don‚Äôt want to just be stuck within one company‚Äôs stuff.    For the cryptonauts out there, the interesting bits are the infrastructure plumbing. Something has to compute all that's in the digital world. Something else has to deliver permissionless identity, financial services and exchange. Something else has to store all the data and serve it up to a billion people and a trillion robots. If you understand Ethereum, you understand where all this is going from an economic perspective.      For Facebook, however, it is about the mushy human psyche at scale ‚Äì connected into tribes through social networking and pictures of sunsets and evening dinners. In that slice of the world, the company mediates identity through logins, battles the monsters of misinformation with more than 30,000 staff and who knows how many advanced machine learning algorithms, and sells the Oculus hardware bundled with modern entertainment experiences. If Facebook lives on a digital, decentralized blockchain in the future ‚Äì likely not of its own making ‚Äì then the least it can do is continue to own distribution and the human dopamine receptors.    Read more: How Axie Infinity Creates Work in the Metaverse | Leah Callon-Butler    To advocates of universal basic income (UBI) like Andrew Yang, robots will automate both blue collar and white collar work, such that only the worst, most menial, frustrating and low-value emotional work remains. People will simply go nuts. Social inequality will continue to rise as capital accrues to robot owners (this part is pretty true), and the government will have no other path but to print out UBI checks. BRRRR! This is certainly the direction we are heading in.      What‚Äôs a bit more novel is to notice how the alternative to work is beginning to form. The venture capital bingo euphemism for making money in virtual worlds is called ‚Äúthe creator economy.‚Äù The brightest example of virtual worlds crashing through the legacy physical one is Axie Infinity, a crypto based Pokemon-like video game. Since the end of last year, if you lived in the Philippines, or likely anywhere else in the world, your local minimum wage paid you less than playing Axie.    Getting your credentials    We‚Äôve established the economic metaverse ‚Äì a place where people will express themselves through social, relational and creative labor. What comes next is establishing the social hierarchy. In the traditional economy, the best signal you could get was a college education. Since the 1970s, college attendance doubled to about 6% of the population of the United States, or 20 million students. However, going to college is a low-quality signal. It is not sufficiently hard to achieve to differentiate into the top-paying careers.      Therefore, you‚Äôve got the Ivy League ‚Äì a gold star of prestige. Demand for Ivy League diplomas continues to increase, with the most recent admission rate of 7%, down by over a third from an 11% admission rate 10 years ago. If you subscribe to the theory that much of undergraduate education in the U.S. is signaling rather than learning, as we do, then it makes sense that the 20,000 top school spots in the U.S. are badges of selection filtering and that they are getting more scarce relative to the availability and commodification of the education ‚Äúgood‚Äù itself.    Read more: What DeFi Has in Common With Cubism | Lex Sokolin    What about credentials in the metaverse?      Let‚Äôs say your community ethos is to reject traditionalism and invent your own online nation. You are allergic to people in suits. Your millions have been minted in internet forums, hacker jobs and DeFi speculation. You care about being early and right, and this has been rewarded through access and capital gains. Your team can move markets, shallow as those markets are, and your gang collectives are called DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations). Together, you combine assets from all over the world to build a web free from Silicon Valley monopoly, nodes networked to compute software, twitchy Twitter tweets at the ready.      You select a banner of 10,000 CryptoPunks ‚Äì there aren‚Äôt that many of you yet anyway. Each one is an avatar, a certificate of authenticity from a community in which your economic self is instantiated. It starts as a game, because all of life is a game.      Like Harvard degrees, Punks are limited in supply. For early adopters, they were affordable and democratic, but we are not early anymore. Prices for the cheapest Punks are $50,000. The most expensive has sold for over $10 million, but the price has no limit. Unlike Harvard degrees, which are at least inflated every year to accommodate new students, Punks have no inflation. There is no room but for the OGs (original gangsters). Supply is fixed and demand increases ‚Äì everyone in the metaverse needs a flag.    Read more: The 5 NFT Trends to Watch | Lex Sokolin    But wait! Like colleges, we can make more flags. There are only 20,000 Ivy League spots, but 20 million students. The premier spots have already been given away. So we have to create more signals for the latecomers. The next metaverse avatar is Masks. And then Apes, and Bored Ape Kennel Club, and MoonCats, and Cool Cats, and Wicked Craniums, and DeadHeads, and so on. This will happen until we have enough avatars for everyone, with different levels of wealth, cultural and prestige signaling.      The formula is pretty clear ‚Äì a 10,000 generative print of digital avatars that look good on a Twitter profile, cost ETH 0.1 to mint, and very quickly appreciates in value, leading to a speculative run-up. Everyone is buying the signal of participation in the non-fungible token game. In fact, it is the price of admission. A collective game to build social capital and credibility in the metaverse is well underway. Of course, Facebook wants in.

42407050,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf96te,1627582338,"Bitcoin, on Cusp of Longest Winning Streak Since 2015, Struggles at $40K","Bitcoin has notched an eight-day winning streak that has taken the price to above $40,000. The cryptocurrency was trading at $30,000 as recently as July 21 and has been climbing since.      If it ends the day in the green, bitcoin would have its longest winning streak since October 2015.      But as of press time, the largest cryptocurrency was down slightly since 0:00 coordinated universal time on Thursday, slipping back to below $40,000.      ‚ÄúAfter this eight-day rally, bitcoin may well need to reset as there is a bearish divergence appearing on the short-term frame,‚Äù said Laurent Kssis, managing director of exchange-traded products at 21Shares AG.      On bitcoin's daily chart, price action is playing out as the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders top formation in a $28,000 to $42,000 range, said Imran Yusof, a technical analyst at Quantum Economics.      Yusof noted that head-and-shoulders top formations are typically bearish.      ‚ÄúThis range matches the same range in the left shoulder period from Christmas 2020 to early February, also on the daily chart,‚Äù he added.      In order for the bitcoin rally to continue, ‚Äúmore interest is needed from corporate America,‚Äù said Edward Moya, a senior analyst at Oanda, an online broker. He believes that acceptance of bitcoin as a means of payment and more firm commitments from institutional investors will further the rally.      The steady rise in bitcoin is a ‚Äúclear sign that institutional investors are gradually scaling into their longer-term positions,‚Äù Moya said.      Moya said planned cuts in the maximum allowed leverage on bitcoin derivatives trades on the Binance and FTX cryptocurrency exchanges might help to damp price volatility, which could help to draw in new investors who were leery of the elevated risk.      The cuts in the leverage limits ""should be very supportive for bitcoin‚Äòs longer-term outlook,‚Äù Moya said.      ‚ÄúThe significance of eight straight days of gains is outweighed by the significance of the aforementioned range, i.e. the will of bitcoin bears pressuring above the $42K resistance versus the will of bitcoin bulls supporting below $28K,‚Äù Yusof said.      ‚ÄúIf bitcoin can come down and hold above $35K, there's a better chance that renewed bullish sentiment alone can drive it through $42K later,‚Äù he added.

This is the company&apos;s first On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), a payment solution leveraging token XRP, in Japan. The corridor has been launched in collaboration with SBI Remit, one of the country&apos;s most prominent money transfer provided, according to Ripple, and the leading mobile wallet for the Philippines, Coins.ph.

42407032,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf93vf,1627581309,"Cats Clog Ethereum, the Sequel","Ethereum had another hairball, this time called ‚ÄúStoner Cats.‚Äù Sales of the much-anticipated, star-studded animated series with a non-fungible token (NFT) tie-in resulted in losses of 344.6 ETH ($790,000) because of failed transactions at the show's launch on Tuesday, according to Dune Analytics.      Demand was high for the rare crossover event between crypto and Hollywood that was developed by actress Mila Kunis and that featured Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin alongside a host of comedic legends. Some 10,420 Stoner Cats NFTs sold out at 0.35 ETH (about $785) within 40 minutes.    This article is excerpted from¬†The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full¬†newsletter here.    But many ran into cat-astrophe while minting their Stoner Cat NFTs. The influx of users throttled the Ethereum network and caused the pricing mechanism on the minting contract to present incorrect gas fee estimates.      The high-profile event once again raises age-old questions about the limitations of the Ethereum protocol, as well as newer considerations about the responsibility creators have to their audience.    What went wrong    According to industry publication The Defiant, the majority of users who lost out were likely those who attempted to mint 20 NFTs (the maximum allowed) without manually adjusting the gas limit in Metamask, which is a software cryptocurrency wallet that's used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. An influx of buyers temporarily drove Ethereum gas fees to $33.67 (from $9.50), according to analytics firm Defi Prime, meaning those whose bids placed earlier likely didn‚Äôt have enough gwei to pay for the entire transaction. Although those transactions failed, the gas was still paid.      ‚ÄúIn this case, the gas limit wasn‚Äôt set high enough to cover all steps in the transaction, so the transaction failed. However it‚Äôs not failing until it runs out, so ~100% of allocated gas is actually being used even without the transaction succeeding,‚Äù decentralized finance developer 0xWave theorized.      In crypto, the prevailing ideology is that people take responsibility for their actions. If you ‚Äúape into‚Äù an unaudited project and lose your shirt, that‚Äôs on you. In this instance, that mindset is complicated. As many have noted, it‚Äôs possible that Stoner Cat developers failed to anticipate the demand for the project and set the minimum gas price too low.      The developers have reportedly blamed MetaMask, a key component of the Ethereum stack. It should be noted the show delayed its NFT launch after technical challenges on Monday.      Another piece of the puzzle is the inbuilt limitations of Ethereum itself. Although it has ambitions to become a global computing platform for anyone to deploy unstoppable code, spiking gas fees and limited throughput (the rate of processing transactions) have long plagued the second-largest blockchain by market cap.      ‚ÄúAs usual, cats clogged Ethereum,‚Äù DeFi Prime tweeted, in a nod to the first successful NFT project, CryptoKitties, which infamously caused Ethereum to crawl to a halt in 2017. Back then, the cat-themed dapp reportedly prevented 30,000 transactions from being processed.      Transactions were delayed, people complained, and Ethereum‚Äôs core developers began work on a complete network overhaul, called Ethereum 2.0, which is still in progress. It can‚Äôt come soon enough.      ‚ÄúStoner Cats‚Äù is reportedly the first TV show entirely funded by NFTs, or at least the first that mainstream media cares about. It‚Äôs unlikely to be the last. The show raised over $8 million on Wednesday by selling NFTs. The production team plans to release a further 3,000 each episode. It‚Äôs a model that lets fans share in the wealth created while also giving its creators near-complete creative control.      But there are still bugs to work out.

42407015,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf93is,1627573107,ProFunds Mutual Fund Gives Retails Investors Access to Bitcoin Futures,"ProFunds, an asset manager that manages $60 billion worldwide, has registered a mutual fund based on bitcoin futures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      The SEC is reviewing more than a dozen bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications and has delayed decisions on several of them. The launch of a bitcoin futures-focused mutual fund slightly increases retail access to the crypto market for retail investors, though it won't be as efficient or attractive for investors as an ETF might be.      Mutual funds give retail investors access to professionally managed portfolios, but they can only be bought or sold once daily and cannot be traded throughout the day as stocks and ETFs can.      To the crypto industry, however, a bitcoin futures mutual fund is like a music artist releasing an album on CD instead of a music streaming service, said Bloomberg Intelligence ETFs analyst Eric Balchunas.      ‚ÄúAdmittedly, we were paying a little less attention to the mutual fund side because the ETF side is where the real prize is,‚Äù Balchunas said. ‚ÄúThis thing is holding futures in a mutual fund wrapper, and it's likely not going to be tax efficient. What people really desire is a physically backed bitcoin ETF, in an ETF wrapper that is tax efficient.‚Äù      The move is positive for funds that hold bitcoin futures, but may not mean anything for applications that aim to create funds that hold physical bitcoin, Balchunas said.      This mutual fund was filed under The Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) whereas the bitcoin ETF applications are being filed under Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) which has less investor protections, Balchunas added. 1940 Act funds are required to invest in securities, and bitcoin isn‚Äôt a security, Balchunas said. Because the mutual fund holds Treasurys for margin, those can count as securities for a 1940 Act requirement.      Bitcoin Strategy ProFund (BTCFX) aims to ‚Äúinvest all or substantially all‚Äù of its assets into CME bitcoin futures contracts. During ‚Äúunusual market conditions,‚Äù however, the mutual fund may invest assets into Canadian bitcoin ETFs, such as Purpose Bitcoin CAD ETF or CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF.      The filing noted that the fund won't invest any more than 10% of its assets into these ETFs.      ‚ÄúThe Fund does not take temporary defensive positions,‚Äù the filing said. ‚ÄúThe Fund will generally hold its bitcoin-related investments during periods in which the value of bitcoin is flat or declining as well as during periods in which the value of bitcoin is rising. For example, if the Fund‚Äôs bitcoin-related investments are declining in value, the Fund generally will not exit its positions except as needed to meet redemption requests.‚Äù",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/29/profunds-mutual-fund-gives-retails-investors-access-to-bitcoin-futures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1381597c6f3288d3ac250e0d727e105fdafd687-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The opposite happens in inefficient markets such as decentralized finance (DeFi) where the availability of alpha is more prevalent, although not easy to discover and capture.    Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform for crypto assets. He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds. He is an active investor, speaker, author and guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York.    DeFi has challenged many aspects of traditional capital markets including the creation and discovery of alpha. The sources and mechanisms for producing alpha in DeFi are diverse, unorthodox and challenging from a technological standpoint but they also lead to great opportunities.      What are the sources of alpha in DeFi and how can we take advantage of them? Let‚Äôs start with a simple question.    What is alpha?    Alpha is an overloaded term in capital markets that typically refers to the ability of an investment strategy to outperform the market. By market, we often refer to benchmark indices such as the S&P 500, Nikkei 225 or Russell 2000 which capture the performance of a specific financial sector. In semi-efficient markets, it is inconceivable that strategies that invest in passive index benchmarks or portfolios can systematically outperform the markets.¬†One of the most emblematic and simple to understand papers about alpha discovery in traditional capital markets was published in 2019 by BlueMountain Capital. In that research, BlueMountain attributes most alpha produced in financial markets with four fundamental sources:    Behavioral:¬†A behavioral-type alpha exists when an investor, or more likely a group of investors, behave in a way that causes price and value to diverge.  Informational:¬†An information-based alpha arises when some market participants have different information than others and can trade profitably on that asymmetry.  Analytical:¬†An analytical-type alpha takes place when all participants have the same, or very similar, information and one investor can analyze it better than the others can.  Technical:¬†Alpha can also be based on technical market inefficiencies. This is common when some market participants have to buy or sell securities for reasons that are unrelated to fundamental value such as laws, regulations or internal policies that can produce a divergence between price and value.    These four categories capture the source of most alpha produced in traditional capital markets. While many of these categories certainly apply to the world of DeFi, the new market certainly adds its unique touch to it.    Is DeFi alpha different?    In one word, yes! Comparing alpha in traditional capital markets versus DeFi is the analogous of comparing Newtonian and Einstein physics. Some of the principles of Newton‚Äôs laws apply in the universe of relativity but most laws are completely different.    Read more: When DeFi Becomes Intelligent | Jesus Rodriguez    The programmability and decentralization of DeFi protocols together with the native inefficiencies of this nascent market, makes alpha in DeFi different from other asset classes and even crypto in centralized markets. In general, the unique characteristics of alpha in DeFi markets can be attributed to two fundamental elements:    The ability of benchmarking the DeFi market  The native sources of alpha in DeFi  The DeFi index benchmark dilemma    Indexes are the default mechanisms to evaluate the performance of a specific asset class and they are essential to quantify the degrees of alpha in a given market. However, the idea of benchmarking the DeFi market through an index mechanism is not that trivial as the behavior of the market is dictated not only by asset prices but also by the behavior of protocols.      In traditional capital markets, the units that compose a given index are a direct representation of the performance of a given segment of the market. The Russell 2000 is based on a representation of the small cap equities while the Nasdaq Composite is based on a selection of technology equities. Outperforming those market indexes is a direct measure of alpha but that methodology does not quite apply in the case of DeFi.      The equivalent of a traditional market index in Defi would be to model an index of the governance tokes of different DeFi protocols. We have examples of this already in the market such as the DeFi Pulse Index or the Bitwise Index. Could we say that a strategy that outperforms those indexes is effectively producing alpha?    Read more: 10 Reasons Quant Strategies for Crypto Fail | Jesus Rodriguez    The answer is not quite simple because the governance tokens are not a direct representation of the performance of the DeFi market. Other metrics such as total value locked (TVL) in specific protocols or liquidity mining fees are a clearer reflection of DeFi alpha and are not directly related to the price of governance tokens.      DeFi poses a challenge to traditional index methodologies because quantifying the performance of the market can‚Äôt simply be reduced to modeling a weighted average with the prices of the governance tokens. The behavior and activity of the underlying protocols is equally if not a more important vector to benchmark the performance of the DeFi space. The lack of a clear index methodology makes quantifying alpha in DeFi drastically more challenging than in other asset classes.    The sources of alpha in DeFi    The lack of a clear quantification method are not the only characteristics that make alpha unique in the DeFi space. Arguably, the strongest differentiator of DeFi alpha is related to its singular provenance and formation. Alpha takes many shapes and forms in DeFi but, most of the time, can be associated with one of the following sources:    Infrastructure Alpha    DeFi‚Äôs market infrastructure layer can be, by itself, a source of alpha. Validator or staking nodes in DeFi runtimes are able to produce returns that can be considered alpha by standard market definitions. By hosting validators or staking nodes, DeFi infrastructure providers can earn alpha returns in the form of rewards without having to execute a specific market trading strategy. This type of dynamic has no analogies in traditional markets but is part of what makes DeFi alpha unique.    Protocol alpha    Financial primitives in the form of protocols are the cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem and, without a doubt, its most important source of alpha. Part of the beauty of DeFi is that the infrastructure itself is growing. The launch of new protocols such as Uniswap v3 or Curve v2 creates new forms of alpha that are not present in a previous iteration of the market. This source of alpha is likely to remain relevant while the DeFi space continues to evolve.    Governance alpha    Changing the rules of establishing DeFi protocol is another vector that leads to the systematic creation of alpha. In protocols like Curve, Compound or Aave, governance proposals regularly alter aspects such as liquidity incentives which can immediately translate into alpha type returns. Monitoring and taking advantage of governance proposals is one of the most lucrative trading strategies in the current state of the DeFi space.    Information alpha    In an unregulated, inefficient, early stage market such as DeFi, the asymmetry of information can lead to incredible returns. Parties close to new protocols have access to information, such as a token‚Äôs distribution model, launch of integration schedules, governance proposals that can translate into major sources of alpha. As the DeFi market becomes more efficient, this asymmetry is likely to be corrected, allowing a more level playing field between investors in-the-know from the beginning and everyone else.    Analytic alpha    An analytic edge is a source of alpha in any market and DeFi is no different. DeFi is an incredibly data-rich market in which the behavior of the core financial primitives is available on public blockchains. Analyzing those blockchain datasets often leads to understanding protocol and trading patterns that can capture alpha in the DeFi space.    A different but exciting type of alpha    DeFi is reimagining many of the core concepts related to the creation of alpha traditional capital markets. The unique characteristics of DeFi translate into sources of alpha that we haven‚Äôt seen before. While the traditional methods to quantify alpha don‚Äôt directly apply in the DeFi space, the new market offers completely asymmetric forms of alpha across all layers of the stack.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/29/finding-alpha-in-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dfb35723714ba5c6e4dd89b01341212475ee7a7-1400x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The gauge is designed to indicate the level of implied volatility in the crypto market through a decentralized index from crypto options prices. It is similar to the VIX volatility index, often called the fear index, on the S&P 500.  ""A challenge is the creation of a platform and ecosystem to trade the index,"" a COTI spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""The problem here is what works for the VIX cannot work for crypto markets, since the market would always be off balance and illiquid. We solved this by creating an AMM [automated market maker] and [self-adjusting] volatility tokens.""  Staking is fundamental to how the index works because users must be incentivized to make it work, the spokesperson told CoinDesk.  With the enhancement, users can open USDC positions and stake CVI USDC through the index, an emailed announcement Thursday said.  Introduced in October 2020, the index initially supported trades and deposits in either ether or tether.  Volatility tokens have also been introduced as part of CVI 2.0 to be used as a hedging tool by investors.  The first such token is USDC-ETH, which can be be traded on all Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges.  CVI 2.0 also includes margin trading on the Polygon network, allowing users to access greater sums of capital.

Despite the recent euphoria, however, Fabric Ventures co-founder and managing partner Richard Muirhead said his team has been in talks with the EIF since as far back as December 2019.      ‚ÄúRaising venture capital in Europe has lagged behind the U.S.,‚Äù Muirhead said in an interview. ‚ÄúEurope has come on leaps and bounds, but needs to do even better with backing new managers and new strategies.‚Äù      EIF Chief Executive Alain Godard said in a statement that the Fabric partnership was ‚Äúof particular strategic importance for the EU and our competitiveness on the global stage,‚Äù adding:    ‚ÄúDespite their rich engineering talent, entrepreneurs in the blockchain sector in Europe often struggle to find financial support and investors that have a deep understanding of their space. This partnership seeks to address that need and unlock financing opportunities for entrepreneurs active in the field of blockchain technologies.‚Äù  Read more: VCs Pumped $4B Into Crypto Firms in Q2: CB Insights    Fabric Ventures, previously called Firestartr, began taking an interest in blockchain and crypto back in 2013, Muirhead said. As well as investing directly into bitcoin and ether, the firm made early bets on Polkadot, MakerDAO, Tagomi, Bitstamp, Decentraland and 1inch, to name a few.      ‚ÄúFabric supported an early Ethereum meetup I led in January 2014 and followed my team as we spun out Parity in 2016,‚Äù Wood, the Ethereum co-founder, said via email. ‚ÄúSo we were very happy to have them as a backer in 2017 when we launched Polkadot.

More important than price, however, is that the listing itself is a ""groundbreaking moment"" for the blockchain machine-learning platform, Fetch CEO Humayun Sheikh told CoinDesk via a spokesperson on Wednesday.      FET is an token that is based on the Ethereum blockchain and that powers applications on Fetch's platform, which provides users access to artificial intelligence and autonomous agents in manufacturing and supply chains, among other areas.      Prior to the listing, most of Fetch's retail investors came from Europe.      The listing ""has a very powerful branding effect on the project,"" Sheikh said. ""With millions of retail investors based in the U.S. looking to invest in cryptos beyond bitcoin and ether, the FET token will gain additional awareness and trading volume due to the listing.""      Prices for FET shot up in the days prior to the announcement, rising 75% from July 17 lows of around $0.19 to a top of $0.42 on Monday, two days prior to Fetch's big moment, Binance data show.      That is not unusual for a coin being listed on one of the world's best-known exchanges. Often dubbed the ""Coinbase Effect,"" the phenomenon is when a cryptocurrency experiences a sharp uptick in price preceding and following its listing.      After the listing, though, a crypto's price tends to cool as speculative traders look to cash in on the hype surrounding the crypto's new home. On Coinbase, prices for FET are down considerably from a local high of $0.65 on Tuesday. That's $0.23 more than Binance's local top.      Asked if the project would liquidate some of the value of its tokens to fund further development of the platform, the CEO said Fetch ""keeps all options open"" but generally focuses on investors and partnerships.      Sheikh also said that while he isn't at liberty to discuss the process for a Coinbase listing, it did involve a ""lot of due diligence"" on security, legal, technical and compliance matters.      The ""process can take months and years as they review every aspect of the project before they decide to go ahead,"" Sheikh said.      FET was last seen changing hands for around $0.34 on Coinbase with lower- than-average hourly trading volume following price action that had cooled down by Wednesday evening.

The Charlotte, N.C.-based bank, the second largest in the U.S. by total assets, said that CBDCs could ‚Äúreplace cash completely in the (distant) future.‚Äù      The report comes amid surging interest among central banks. A May report by the blockchain infrastructure platform Bison Trails found that about 80% of central banks are exploring use cases involving CBDCs, with 40% already testing proof-of-concept programs.      Bank of America said that CBDC adoption was ‚Äúinevitable,‚Äù citing a declining role for cash, the private sector‚Äôs increasing use of blockchain technology, loss of control over currency and CBDCs' potential to boost the economy. It also noted that central banks that did not launch their own digital currencies could see decreasing demand for their currencies, ""substantially in some cases,"" and a smaller ""global role.""      Addressing concerns that a CBDC could compete with bank deposits, spur bank runs and compromise individual security, the paper highlighted central banks‚Äô ‚Äúvery cautious approach.‚Äù      The paper said that CBDCs qualified as money ‚Äúby allowing store of value and being a unit of account and means of exchange,‚Äù differentiating them from cryptocurrencies that ‚Äúdo not meet these criteria. ‚ÄúSince they are traded, they could be seen as an asset class,‚Äù the paper said.

42387392,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmjRD,1627527199,Think Tank Rand Says Crypto Should Be Included in US-Japan Digital Trade Deal,"Cryptocurrencies should be written into the Japan-U.S. trade agreement that was signed in 2019, two experts from a prominent think tank said.      In a blog post on Wednesday, Rand Corporation senior policy analyst Sale Lilly and senior political scientist Scott Harold said the deal was a missed opportunity for the crypto industry.      ""Given that some of the earliest cryptocurrency markets began in Japan, and that many of the largest companies originate in the U.S., this decision was somewhat surprising,"" the pair wrote.      The 2019 agreement was a ""landmark"" document touching on a number of topics that hadn't been included in previous international trade discussions.      Digital representations of a photo, movie or song as well as trading an algorithm are now components of bilateral trade covered by the agreement, which prevents new tariffs between the two countries.      With the beginnings of new political regimes in Washington and Tokyo, it may be time to reconsider the exclusion of crypto in the deal, Lilly and Harold wrote.    The art of the deal    The deal, which was inked during Donald Trump's presidency and ahead of other major international digital trade agreements, is ""especially prescient"" given it came right before the outbreak of COVID-19, the pair said.      Still, there is no mention of crypto and only some aspects of blockchain may land under the purview of the tariff-free structure.      ""The reality ... is that blockchain systems are often deployed alongside better-established networks, like Ethereum or Cardano, that do employ tokens and digital currency,"" they said.      Concerns arise from the potential to retroactively tack tariffs onto budding blockchain and crypto businesses as long as cryptos remain excluded from the agreement.      To rectify that, Lilly and Harold said the U.S. and Japan could formulate a new agreement covering crypto and digital assets or else reinterpret the terms of the 2019 agreement.      Rand's approach and analysis of cryptos have changed significantly in recent years given the development of the digital currencies and regulations. In 2015, the think tank released a 100-page report that focused on scenarios in which entities in conflict zones could seek to use a digital currency for nefarious means.      ""A clear, jointly negotiated U.S.-Japan agreement toward regulating the use of cryptocurrencies in international trade may be an idea whose time has come,"" Lilly and Harold wrote.
