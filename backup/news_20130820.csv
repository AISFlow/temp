42394596,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDTUN,1377032341,Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?,"While we may not know who Satoshi Nakamoto was, we know what he (or she) did. Nakamoto was the inventor of the Bitcoin protocol, publishing a paper via the Cryptography Mailing List in November 2008.  Nakamoto then released the first version of the Bitcoin software client in 2009, participating with others on the project via mailing lists,until he finally began to fade from the community toward the end of 2010.  Nakamoto worked with people on the open-source team but took care never to reveal anything personal about himself, and the last anyone heard from him was in the spring of 2011, when he said that he had ""moved on to other things.""  Was Satoshi Nakamoto Japanese?  Best not to judge a book by its cover. Or in fact, maybe we should.  ""Satoshi"" means ""clear thinking, quick witted; wise."" ""Naka"" can mean ""medium, inside, or relationship."" ""Moto"" can mean ""origin"" or ""foundation.""  Those things would all apply to the person who founded a movement by designing a clever algorithm. The problem, of course, is that each word has multiple possible meanings.  We can’t know for sure whether Nakamoto was Japanese or not. In fact, it's presumptuous to assume that he was actually a ""he."" Allowing for the fact that ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" could have been a pseudonym, ""he"" could have been a ""she,"" or even a ""they.""  Does anyone know who Satoshi Nakamoto was?  No, but the detective techniques that people use when guessing are sometimes even more intriguing than the answer. The New Yorker’s Joshua Davis believed that Satoshi Nakamoto was Michael Clear, a graduate cryptography student at Dublin's Trinity College.  He arrived at this conclusion by analyzing 80,000 words of Nakamoto’s online writings and searching for linguistic clues. He also suspected Finnish economic sociologist and former games developer Vili Lehdonvirta.  Both have denied being bitcoin’s inventor. Michael Clear publicly denied being Satoshi at the 2013 Web Summit.  Adam Penenberg at Fast Company disputed that claim, arguing instead that Nakamoto may actually have been three people: Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry. He figured this out by typing unique phrases from Nakamoto’s bitcoin paper into Google, to see if they were used anywhere else.  One of them, ""computationally impractical to reverse,"" turned up in a patent application made by these three for updating and distributing encryption keys. The bitcoin.org domain name originally used by Satoshi to publish the paper had been registered three days after the patent application was filed.  It was registered in Finland, and one of the patent authors had traveled there six months before the domain was registered. All of them deny it.  In any case, when bitcoin.org was registered on Aug. 18, 2008, the registrant actually used a Japanese anonymous registration service, and hosted it using a Japanese ISP. The registration for the site was only transferred to Finland on May 18, 2011, which weakens the Finland theory somewhat.  Others think Nakamoto was Martii Malmi, a developer living in Finland who has been involved with bitcoin since the beginning and developed its user interface.  Another possibility is Jed McCaleb, a lover of Japanese culture and resident of Japan, who created troubled bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and cofounded decentralized payment systems Ripple and later Stellar.  Another theory suggests that computer scientists Donal O'Mahony and Michael Peirce are Satoshi, based on a paper that they authored concerning digital payments, along with Hitesh Tewari, based on a book that they published together. O’Mahony and Tewari also studied at Trinity College, where Michael Clear was a student.  Israeli scholars Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute retracted allegations made in a paper suggesting a link between Satoshi and Silk Road, the black market web site that was taken down by the FBI in October 2013. They had suggested a link between an address allegedly owned by Satoshi, and the site. Security researcher Dustin D. Trammell owned the address, and disputed claims that he was Satoshi.  In May 2013, internet pioneer Ted Nelson threw another hat into the ring: Japanese mathematician Professor Shinichi Mochizuki, although he admits that the evidence is circumstantial at best.  In February 2014, Newsweek’s Leah McGrath Goodman claimed to have tracked down the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Dorian S. Nakamoto has since denied he knows anything about bitcoin, eventually hiring a lawyer and releasing an official statement to that effect.  Hal Finney, Michael Weber, Wei Dai and several other developers were among those who are periodically named in media reports and online discussions as potential Satoshis. A group of forensic linguistics experts from Aston University believe the real creator of bitcoin is Nick Szabo, based upon analysis of the Bitcoin White Paper.  Dominic Frisby, a comedian and a writer, also suggests that BitGold creator Szabo was the most likely candidate to be Satoshi in his book, “Bitcoin: The Future of Money.” His detailed analysis involved the linguistics of Satoshi's writing, judging the level of technical skill in C++ and even Satoshi's likely birthday.  In Nathaniel Popper's book, ""Digitial Gold,"" released in May 2015, Popper reveals that in a rare encounter at an event Szabo again denied that he was Satoshi.  Then in early December 2015, reports by Wired and Gizmodo tentatively claimed to have identified Nakamoto as Australian entrepreneur Craig S Wright. WIRED cited ""an anonymous source close to Wright"" who provided a cache of emails, transcripts and other documents that point to Wright's role in the creation of bitcoin. Gizmodo cited a cache of documents sourced from someone claiming to have hacked Wright’s business email account, as well as efforts to interview individuals close to him. While most other individuals speculated to be Nakamoto have insisted they are not the inventor of Bitcoin, Wright is the exception, claiming to be Nakamoto. However, many believe the evidence so far presented to be insufficient to confirm this claim, and some even think the reports that made the initial connection were misled by Wright himself in an elaborate hoax.  So what do we know about Satoshi Nakamoto?  One thing we know, based on interviews with people that were involved with him at an early stage in the development of bitcoin, is that he thought the system out very thoroughly.  His coding wasn’t conventional, according to core developer Jeff Garzik, in that he didn’t apply the same rigorous testing that you would expect from a classic software engineer.  How rich is Satoshi Nakamoto?  An analysis by Sergio Lerner, an authority on bitcoin and cryptography, suggests Nakamoto mined many of the early blocks in the bitcoin network, and that he had built up a fortune of around 1 million unspent bitcoins. That hoard would be worth $18.4 billion U.S. dollars as of Nov. 23, 2020.  What is Satoshi Nakamoto doing now?  No one knows what Nakamoto is up to, but one of the last emails he sent to a software developer, dated Apr. 23, 2011, said, ""I’ve moved on to other things. It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone.""  Did Satoshi Nakamoto work for the government?  There are rumors, of course. People have interpreted his name as meaning ""central intelligence,"" but people will see whatever they want to see. Such is the nature of conspiracy theories.  The obvious question would be why one of the three-letter agencies would be interested in creating a cryptocurrency that would subsequently be used as an anonymous trading mechanism, causing senators and the FBI alike to wring their hands about potential terrorism and other criminal endeavors. No doubt conspiracy theorists will have their views on that, too.  Perhaps it doesn’t matter. Core developer Jeff Garzik puts it succinctly, ""Satoshi published an open-source system for the purpose that you didn’t have to know who he was, and trust who he was, or care about his knowledge,"" he points out. Open-source code makes it impossible to hide secrets. ""The source code spoke for itself.""  Moreover, it was smart to use a pseudonym, he argues, because it forced people to focus on the technology itself rather than on the personality behind it. At the end of the day, bitcoin is now far bigger than Satoshi Nakamoto.

42394591,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDT9r,1377032341,How to Store Your Bitcoin,"Just like with your bank account or physical wallet, you need a place to store your bitcoin after purchasing it.  Bitcoin is stored in digital wallets – a type of computer software that connects to the Bitcoin network. Just like bank cards have account numbers, digital wallets feature a unique address that can be shared with others when you make transactions.  This unique address is a shorter, more usable version of your public key. It consists of between 26 and 35 random alphanumeric characters and typically appears in this form: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.  It is worth stating that every letter and number in this address is important. Always double-check a Bitcoin address before sending or receiving funds.  Keep your bitcoin private keys private  In addition to the public key, a Bitcoin address also has a private key. And as the name suggests, this key should not be shared with anyone. Anyone with access to your private key can easily access your wallet and steal your funds. Similarly, if you fail to securely store your private key and you lose it, chances are that you may never be able to recover your bitcoin.  An easy way to understand public and private keys is to think of your public key like your home address. Anyone can see it and use it to send deliveries to your house, or in this case, transactions. Your private key is like the key to your front door. It is something that only you want to be in possession of, and it is what keeps other people from being able to access the contents of your digital wallet.  A private key is used to verify that you own the public key. It allows you to access your wallet and to sign off on transactions. Some wallets automatically generate a secure seed phrase; a set of words that allow you to unlock your wallet if you lose your keys. Print out this phrase or write it on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe place. Never take a photo of or take a screenshot of your seed words.  Read more: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  Types of bitcoin wallets  Also, as with bank accounts, there are different types of wallets for storing your bitcoin, each offering its own set of pros and cons. In a broad sense, there are two main categories of bitcoin wallets:  Hot wallets: These types of bitcoin wallets are connected to the internet and are typically available online or on your smartphone.  Cold wallets: These types of bitcoin wallets cannot be accessed through the internet. They often involve physical devices (like a USB stick), where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be stored securely offline.  Hot wallets  Although relatively less secure, hot wallets are the most popular in the crypto world because of their convenience. Because hot wallets are already connected to the internet, it means people can access and exchange funds quickly – something that’s important if you want to make quick trades when the crypto market is moving. Some popular examples in this category include mobile wallets (for example, BitPay), web or online wallets (for example, Coinbase) and desktop wallets (for example, Bitcoin Core).  When you register on a cryptocurrency trading platform, a web wallet will be automatically created for you to store your bitcoin. One of the downsides of using web wallets on exchange platforms is your private keys are being held by a third party. Remember the front door key analogy? Now, imagine someone else owning the key to your house. If they wanted to, the owner of the key could decide to lock you out or someone could break in without your knowledge if the owner lets the key slip into the wrong hands.  To put things in perspective, in 2019, the New Zealand-based exchange Cryptopia was hacked, and more than $17 million in ether and other cryptocurrencies was stolen, forcing the exchange to shut down. A former employee of the exchange was also convicted for stealing $170,000 in crypto by creating copies of Cryptopia's private keys and saving them to a USB. This gave him access to over $100 million in crypto.  On the flip side, an online exchange wallet is arguably the easiest to set up and use, and some leading exchanges now have insurance funds to compensate users in the event of a hack. It is worth noting, though, that this should not be exclusively relied upon.  As earlier mentioned, there are also mobile and desktop wallets (otherwise known as software wallets) that give you a greater level of control and security. Unlike the wallets created by crypto exchanges, most mobile and desktop wallets do give you access to your private keys. But that also means if your mobile phone is hacked or stolen, the thief might be able to get a copy of your wallet and your bitcoin. Software wallets, therefore, require greater security precautions. Electrum and Exodus are examples of software wallets.  Before downloading any software wallet, ensure you conduct your own due diligence and read the reviews of other customers. Also, confirm you are downloading a legitimate copy of a real wallet. Some shady programmers create clones of various crypto websites and offer downloads for free, leading to the possibility of a hack.  Cold wallets  Cold wallets such as hardware wallets or paper wallets are the safest options when it comes to storing your bitcoin. These are completely offline products and cannot be accessed by the internet; meaning someone would have to be in the same physical location as the wallet to steal it. When you use an online paper wallet generator, however, it’s important to note some can pose a security risk because you are trusting the website with key generation. If you do use one, be sure to verify the code has no backdoors (ways for the website developers to see your keys).  These are recommended if you plan to hold your bitcoin for a long time and don't plan to trade it frequently. But, once again, if you lose the hardware wallet, your bitcoin may be lost unless you have kept reliable backups of the keys. Some large investors keep their hardware wallets in secure locations such as bank vaults. Trezor and Ledger are notable examples of leading hardware wallet providers.  If you can’t decide which wallet to go with, don’t worry. Many serious bitcoin investors use a hybrid approach and hold a majority of their crypto wealth offline in cold wallets while keeping a smaller spending balance on a web or online wallet. This is a best-of-both-worlds situation and one that ensures your bitcoin is stored securely.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,"Noelle Acheson, Hoa Nguyen, John Biggs",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-store-your-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc73c0a1c849d4326f26b05eaf79c21365a6e27f-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394590,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDSuT,1377032341,How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work?,"Now that you’ve set up your bitcoin wallet and are ready to make your first transaction, let’s take a look at how bitcoin transactions actually work.  There are three key variables in any bitcoin transaction: an amount, an input and an output. An input is the address from which the money is sent, and an output is the address that receives the funds. Since a wallet can contain several input addresses, you can send money from one or more inputs to one or more outputs. There is also a data storage portion on each transaction, a sort of note, that allows you to record data to the blockchain immutably.  But the unique thing about bitcoin transactions is that, if you initiate a transaction that’s worth less than the total amount in your input, you get your change back not to your original output, but through a new third address in your control. This means your wallet typically ends up containing multiple addresses, and you can pull funds from these addresses to make future transactions.  You’ve learned how to buy and store your bitcoins, so you already know what public and private keys are for, and you’ll need these to issue a transaction. To do that, you put your private key, the amount of bitcoins you want to send and the output address into the bitcoin software on your computer or smartphone.  Then the program generates a signature made from your private key to announce this transaction to the network for validation. The network needs to confirm that you own the bitcoin being transferred and that you haven’t spent it by checking all previous transactions which are public on the ledger. Once the bitcoin program verifies that indeed your private key corresponds to the provided public key (without knowing what your private key is), your transaction is confirmed.  This transaction is now included in a “block” which gets attached to the previous block to be added to the blockchain. Every transaction in the blockchain is tied to a unique identifier called a transaction hash (txid), which looks like a 64-character string of random letters and numbers. You can track a particular transaction by typing this txid in the search bar on the blockchain explorer.  Transactions can’t be undone or tampered with, because it would mean re-doing all the blocks that came after. This process is not instantaneous. Because the bitcoin blockchain is fairly large, it takes a lot of time to process a single transaction among the many on the blockchain.  The amount of time it takes to confirm a transaction varies, ranging anywhere from a few minutes to a couple days, based on traffic on the blockchain and the size of your transaction. Larger transactions with higher fees tend to get validated by miners quicker than smaller ones. That said, once it is confirmed, it is immutably recorded forever.  If you want to indulge in some mindless fascination, you can sit at your desk and watch bitcoin transactions float by. Blockchain.info is good for this, but try BitBonkers if you want a hypnotically fun version.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,"Noelle Acheson, John Biggs, Hoa Nguyen",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-do-bitcoin-transactions-work-2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1daf412c408340687c8598ba3d99639bf1dace38-1012x759.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416876,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhAa,1377005309,Government seized $2.9 Million from bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox,"Article updated on August 20 at 18:46 BST.  The US government seized over $2.9m from Mutum Sigillum LLC, a subsidiary of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, a court document has revealed.  Published yesterday by GigaOM, the seizure warrant issued by the district court in Maryland details that the contents of a Dwolla account registered in the name of Mutum Sigillum LLC were to be seized.  The warrant was issued on 14th May, however, it was only filed on 19th August by US magistrate judge Susan K. Gauvey.  The inventory of property taken reads:  ""Contents of Dwolla account #812-649-1010 registered in the name of Mutum Sillum LLC, held in custody of Veridian Credit Union in the amount of $2,915,507.40.""  Ars Technica obtained a copy of the seizure warrant, minus the inventory, back in May. This detailed why the US Department of Homeland Security issued the warrant.  Mutum Sigillum allegedly did not register with FinCEN as a money services business, in violation of US law, and concealed its existence as a money transmitter on its bank account application. Since then, Mt. Gox has registered as a money transmitter.  At the time of publication, Mt. Gox had not provided comment to CoinDesk.  Richard Howlett, solicitor at Selachii LLP in London, explained that, as Dwolla and Mutum Sigillum LLC are both incorporated in America, the US government has jurisdiction over the transactions and holdings of these companies.  ""When a new and exciting digital currency such as bitcoin comes along, the law is a grey area, but the government will want to take full control over what they see as a threat to the US dollar,"" he said.  ""To this end, bitcoin companies should be concerned because the internet is changing from what was a free enterprise with little or no rules to something much more sinister. It is clear that the internet and digital currency is still the Wild West and there are opportunities for entrepreneurs and business to capitalise in this emerging new market.""  Howlett concluded that if a bitcoin company deals in any way with central bank-issued currency it shouldn't be surprised if they are contacted by the government.  Constance Choi, general counsel at Payward Inc, said the seizure warrant seriously underscores the need to educate the public, including regulators, to distinguish bad actors engaged in illicit acts from legitimate businesses that ""integrate cutting-edge emerging payments technologies that offer enormous social and economic benefits in low-cost payments"".  ""It's a shame that all the public attention centers on these few bad actors rather than the strong governance processes implemented by the best in our industry,"" she added.  Choi said regulators are rightly concerned with the legitimate, emergent public policy concerns that center around AML and consumer protection. ""Many participants in the industry, including Payward, have been willing to discuss these important issues without sensationalized enforcement actions, which create a chilling effect on innovations for consumers.  ""These recent events just emphasize the need for greater dialogue between regulators and the industry, to holistically clarify the scope of regulations and the meaning of these laws as it applies to our new technologies, to share information about our business practices, and work together to strike a balance so that public policy concerns are addressed while allowing the tremendous benefits of this technology to reach consumers.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/20/government-seized-29-million-from-bitcoin-exchange-mt-gox,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a5c7edb2c12b9e1de7ce3ba45f97d783b216080-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416888,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxhWw,1376999622,Bitcoin could be a boon for porn and other high-risk merchants,"Could bitcoin be a boon for the adult entertainment business? At least one payment processor is trying to get bitcoin exchanges and payment firms on board.  Maria Sparagis  , CEO of payment processing firm DirectPayNet, makes a living helping high-risk merchants make a living. She handles payment processing for businesses that the banks are often loath to touch. The adult entertainment industry figures highly in her portfolio, as do online gambling companies, some travel sites and merchants who just have problems getting credit.  She is hoping to bring bitcoin and high-risk merchants together, and make a little money on the side. “Let me help you make more money or B⃦,” says her Twitter slogan.  “I deal with clients in these kinds of spaces on a daily basis, because we focus mainly on medium- to high-risk markets and we listen to their challenges, and bitcoin seems to resolve a lot of them,” she said. “They can get automatic approval, they can process payments from anywhere around the world.”  The big problem  Banks don't necessarily have any moral issue around porn companies (they just tend to follow the money and there is a lot of money in porn). Many banks will happily process credit card payments for large adult entertainment firms, especially those with a good fraud scoring. The problem is that fraud is a constant problem in the adult space. There are two kinds, explains Sparagis: friendly and unfriendly fraud.  Friendly fraud is straightforward buyer’s remorse. Someone might take out a subscription to an adult site and then feel guilty or worry about being found out, leading them to charge back the transaction. Unfriendly fraud is methodical and ruthless: boiler room operations use adult sites to test out stolen credit cards to see if they are valid.  ""Porn sites have one dollar trials, so it’s an easy price point to see if the credit card is good for a further transaction. I learned that the hard way,"" she said. The burden of proof falls to the merchant in these cases.  Every time a chargeback occurs, the merchant pays $25-35. If the ratio goes above a set threshold, the merchant must pay additional fines and can even be blacklisted. Even with sophisticated fraud scrubbing in place, times are tough for porn peddlers.  Early adopters  Some sites have already jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon. Alternative culture erotica site BlueBlood began taking bitcoin in April, as did high-end porn site MetArt. Indeed, there are now directories of bitcoin-enabled adult sites and some of them seem to be acting as arbitrators, taking bitcoin payments on and then reselling accounts on large sites purchased in fiat currency.  One of the advantages of bitcoin is that payments sent are irrecoverable: there are no chargebacks with the crypto currency. The relative anonymity of bitcoin (as long as people know what they're doing) also helps, she said, because consumers often don't want compromising company names showing up on their credit card bills. Even when sites or payment processors try to report an innocuous business name on a credit card statement, a diligent Googler can easily figure out what a spouse, for example, has been buying online.  The adult industry is known for its technological innovation. It was among the first to stream video commercially, for example. “I’m convinced that once the big players go in the underground world, the mainstream guys will follow,” said Spargaris, who used to work for adult entertainment giant Manwin, which owns several huge porn brands. “They’ll see that people are making money off this.”  But it hasn’t happened in significant numbers yet and one of the biggest reasons, other than the concern about regulatory issues and the general lack of awareness, has been bitcoin’s lack of support for recurring payments.  Many sites have taken credit card information for a subscription and have told a buyer that they will keep charging until told otherwise. There is no support for recurring payments in bitcoin’s rudimentary system, and even when the new Bitcoin Payment Message feature emerges in version 0.9, recurring payments won't be a feature.  This may prove less of a problem in the future, however, said Tony Gallippi, CEO of BitPay, a payment processor specializing in bitcoin payments. “That's where the chargebacks came from,” added Gallippi, who spoke about bitcoin earlier this year at the XBiz Summit adult entertainment conference.  “The problem is that whenever they do bill someone and the customer doesn’t like it, they have a whole customer support department that have to handle the phone calls. They then have to go and undo these transactions, which is a lot of work for them. So the industries want to get away from it.”  The Feds' involvement  The US Federal Trade Commission is also tightening its grip on any companies that appear to be operating in a deceptive manner, said Sparagis. This is forcing people away from a recurring billing model that may rely on customers forgetting to cancel a subscription, or being unaware of the recurring fee.  The adult industry isn't the only high-risk business. Gallippi argues that credit card firms hate dealing with companies selling gold and silver – especially those doing it over the Internet. Even some companies providing file backup and storage can have problems, he warns, because credit card companies can be spooked by the spectre of copyright infringement (this doesn't seem to have stopped the likes of Dropbox from taking credit cards, however).  Sparagis also singled out the travel business as a high-risk merchant community. “That’s because of the future fulfillment,” she said. Many travel bookings are placed months in advance.  “Let’s say that I start a travel company today, I could go under six months from now, but I still have all these tickets that I need to honor,” she said, adding that she’s talking about smaller travel firms operating in markets such as timeshares and accommodation.  “If I sold tickets a year from now and I go bankrupt, all these clients will be looking for refunds, but the bank is responsible to refund all these transactions. That’s why anything with future fulfilment, anything past your 60-90 day span is considered relatively high risk.”  With so many high-risk businesses having problems dealing with the banks, bitcoin could present a viable alternative – if only merchants would adopt it, and persuade customers to do the same. Once again, bitcoin is in a catch-22 situation. It needs both sides to adopt the currency to achieve critical mass, and it is likely to be a slow, laborious process.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/20/bitcoin-could-be-a-boon-for-porn-and-other-high-risk-merchants,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1830cd11ae4aaf4769c62d55eb7ee8c174e3a90-2057x1467.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
