42412931,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl70d0,1675813414,Blockchain-Based Render Network Token Rising After Community Vote for New Burn-and-Mint Model,"The utility token of the blockchain-based distributed rendering service Render Network has surged over 80% in value over the past week, following the network’s vote passing a new tokenomics model.  RNDR’s price has climbed 16% during the past 24 hours and 425% this year, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token has risen from just 40 cents on Jan. 1 to its current $2.16.  The most recent uptick has followed a Render Network Jan. 31 vote to pass a new burnt-and-mint equilibrium (BME) model, capping net emissions. According to the proposal posted on GitHub, the new model would allow artists to burn the required amount of RNDR in exchange for non-fungible work credits, which are distributed to node operators.  With the BME model, Render aims to make RNDR a commodity and deflationary asset. Founded by cloud rendering company OTOY's Jules Urbach in 2016, Render Network provides distributed graphics processing unit (GPU)-based rendering service for the culture and entertainment sector.  Crypto data provider Coinglass showed that funding rates for the token currently remained positive in most exchanges, indicating a mostly bullish sentiment among traders.  Elsewhere in markets  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, edged up 2% to recently trade at $23,250. The increase followed remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who in a discussion at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., repeated his comments of last week that “a deflationary process” had started.  In a Tuesday note, Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya wrote that as long as the labor market is cooling and next week’s inflation report doesn’t show a significant increase that ”bitcoin could see further bullish momentum.”  Ether (ETH) emulated BTC’s pattern to recently trade at $1,670, up 3.5% from Monday, same time. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures the overall crypto market performance, was recently up 2.2%.  Traditional markets also rose after Powell’s comments, with the S&P 500 index closing up 1.2%.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has long viewed most cryptocurrencies as being securities that need registration, said these priorities for the examination division aim to protect investors “in a time of growing markets, evolving technologies, and new forms of risk.”  The annual priorities differ from last year’s, which included a brief section on crypto that also focused on the “custody arrangements” for digital assets.

42393850,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQxnR,1675807312,Crypto Markets Analysis: Decline in Bitcoin Transfers Underlines Investor Optimism,"Bitcoin transfers to and from crypto exchanges have fallen, signaling that markets remain cautiously optimistic about the market.  A breakdown of net transfer volume by size shows that both deposits and withdrawals to and from exchanges have decreased recently, despite bitcoin's price uptick this year. The data suggests that investors are still weighing the latest, sometimes conflicting economic indicators but are also upbeat enough to hold onto their BTC instead of placing it on exchanges to trade.  Net transfer volume, which was recently updated by analytics firm Glassnode, presents a visual snapshot of coins sent to or removed from centralized exchanges, categorized by size. By looking at past trends it can help market observers determine what investors are likely to do in the future.  In May 2022, net transfer volumes spiked above 40,000, which ultimately preceded a 37% decline in BTC price from $30,380 to $19,000. Conversely, the decline to $19,000 accompanied a withdrawal of close to 60,000 bitcoin.  The movement of coins on and off of exchanges is not a cause of price movement as much as it reflects investor sentiment. As investors begin to fear price declines, they tend to send more BTC to exchanges. The opposite occurs when investors are bullish.  The recent drop implies that investors may be reluctant to make a call in either direction at the moment.  Bitcoin’s has risen about 38% year to date and 44% over the last 90 days. As a result, many traders could take profits. The absence of a sharp increase in BTC deposits to exchanges should be an encouraging sign for bullish investors.  In short, prices have spiked, investors seem content for the moment, and action has stalled accordingly. Volatility has also narrowed, with the Average True Range (ATR) for BTC falling 13% over the last five trading days.  Trading volume for BTC has also declined, falling below its 20-day moving average for five consecutive trading days, and in eight of the last 10.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/07/crypto-markets-analysis-decline-in-bitcoin-transfers-underlines-investor-optimism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cf12181ab86e16733300dbb8cb5e8b340bf57c4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 3,100-piece collection draws inspiration from vintage pieces in Wotherspoon's personal archive and will ""blend inspiration from future and past worlds.""  The project will be released to holders of the Day One non-fungible token (NFT) mint passes, which launched in December 2022. The collection has done 773 ETH (roughly $1.1 million) in sales to date and currently has a floor price of 0.45 ETH (about $735).  Day One holders can mint digital trunks that contain two unique NFTs: one digital 3D version of a garment and a second 3D ""ink bottle."" There are four digital vintage wearable designs in total and three ink bottles designed by Wotherspoon, which will allow holders to customize their wearables. There are also rarity tiers embedded into the project and a future possibility to choose whether to keep the NFTs as is or combining them to create a new, rarer NFT.  MNTGE plans to open a physical MNTGE Market within the next year featuring vintage clothing curated by Wotherspoon, who founded vintage clothing chain Round Two and has collaborated with major sneaker brands including Nike, Asics and Adidas. MNTGE pass holders will be the first to gain access to the shop.  Wotherspoon follows other Web2 designers and brands that are slowly bringing their designs into Web3.

42412924,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl70WS,1675801729,Trial Lawyer Breaks Down Legal Considerations for NFTs and Trademark Law,"Creating digital art via a non-fungible token (NFT) that closely reflects something created by a brand may not be enough to keep some creators from facing legal ramifications, said David Leichtman, a managing partner at law firm Leichtman Law PLLC.  Leichtman, a trial lawyer with over 20 years of experience, said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday that under trademark law what a brand is protecting “is the value of the brand,” including its name or logo.  On Monday, Yuga Labs, the parent company of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT project, reached a settlement with developer and smart contract builder Thomas Lehman after the company filed a complaint focusing on Lehman’s role in coding Ryder Ripp's project ""RR/BAYC.”  Ripps' project, considered to be a copycat, is a series of 10,000 NFTs that replicate the same names, features and traits as the Bored Ape Yacht Club’s NFTs.  A separate and ongoing court case filed in June by Yuga Labs alleging trademark infringement looks to getting “the cooperation of the defendant,” according to Leichtman. He said the lawsuit was filed to gather more evidence against Ripps. The pending case focuses on whether Ripps and Lehman purposely used Yuga Labs’ logos and Board Apes names to sell Ripps' products.  “The judge in that case determined that the works at issue were not artistic works, which might merit some different kinds of tests and trademark law than if it was just pure commerce,” Leichtman said.  In Yuga Labs’ case, he said, the company carefully crafted its trademark complaint so as to focus on the company’s name and the use of its logo, not the underlying ape art.  According to Leichtman, under copyright law someone is not entitled to copyright the underlying images if they’re created by artificial intelligence (AI).  The situation would be different if Ripps’ images “were just painted,” Leichtman said. He pointed out that NFTs can be “tradable like a stock or security,” but they operate under a different trading system than the stock market.  “So really what we have here [is] it’s sort of a digital right, but it’s not an intellectual property right,” he said. “I can trade the ownership right … but trading the ownership right … does not entitle me to sell a physical good, or to sell the copyright in the piece of art.”  That comparison could be made for the recent trademark battle between NFT artist Mason Rothschild and Hermès, which is close to ending after a years-long battle over Rothschild's “MetaBirkins” NFT project.  However, that case is different, Leichtman said, because Rothschild “didn't sell a physical good, nor did [he] sell a bag, but [he] did sell the image of the bag as an NFT.  “The question then becomes, since they're not exact copies of the Birkin bags and they're artistically derivative of the Birkin bags, what rights does Hermès have?”  Deliberations are still taking place, Leichtman said, and it may come down to “whether or not that relevant consuming audience for Hermès products would’ve been confused by the defendants’ work,” and whether Rothschild intended to mislead the public.

42412935,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl70gk,1675799526,"Bitcoin Favored Over Ether by CME Traders So Far This Year, Arcane Research Report Shows","Institutional traders are prioritizing bitcoin over ether exposure so far in 2023, according to a report from digital asset analysis firm Arcane Research.  Open interest in bitcoin (BTC) futures listed on the derivatives giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has climbed 6% this year while CME’s ether (ETH) futures have declined by 29% in open interest, Arcane Research said.  Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled for an asset.  “This open interest trend deviates from the normal trend in CME futures, and it illustrates that BTC has led the early 2023 market strength,” Arcane Research's Bendik Schei and Vetle Lunde wrote in the report.  Smaller altcoins have also rallied in January, driven by short squeezes, poor liquidity and increased risk appetite among retail investors emboldened by BTC’s surge, the report noted. In contrast, ether hasn't jumped similarly to BTC, which could explain ETH’s relatively weak start in January compared to other altcoins, according to the report.  The report also highlighted that the ETH futures annualized rolling three-month basis has grown in the last few weeks and now sits at similar levels to that of BTC. Both BTC and ETH's futures basis on CME has been positive since the week of Jan. 6, signaling a positive sentiment among traders.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk that institutional investors’ preference for BTC represented “the safest choice in a bear market.” He noted that Ethereum’s upcoming protocol updates might be raising concerns about an increased “risk of things going wrong,” and added that the Shanghai hard fork, which will allow validators who help operate the network to withdraw 16 million staked ETH, “is expected to add selling pressure.”  DiPasquale also said that BTC's role could also serve as the base currency in all altcoin pairs, meaning when the market drops other cryptocurrencies would lose value in both U.S. dollar and BTC terms.

42410847,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs1uu,1675798275,NFT Market Share Battle Ramps Up Between OpenSea and Blur,"2023 has been marked with increasing competition in the non-fungible token (NFT) space as different marketplaces fight for creators and collectors.  OpenSea has been the frontrunner of the NFT marketplaces since its launch in December 2017. It continues to dominate the NFT scene: Last week it had over 34,000 ETH in trading volume worth some $56 million, according to blockchain data analytics platform Nansen. But competing marketplace Blur has gained considerable momentum among JPEG slingers since its debut in October.  Known for its zero trading fees and marketplace “floor sweeping,” Blur has climbed to become the second-largest NFT marketplace in just a couple of months by volume. For the week ending Feb. 6, Blur’s NFT volumes stood over 9,200 ETH worth some $15.2 million, representing more than 25% of OpenSea’s volume, per Nansen.  Market overview  OpenSea’s top five NFT projects by volume in the past 30 days include Sewer Pass, Memes by 6529, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) and Checks – VV Edition.  In comparison, Blur’s top five NFT projects by volume in the past 30 days includes MAYC, Azuki, BoredApeKennelClub, BAYC and Otherdeed for Otherside, all high-volume collections.  While OpenSea and Blur have two overlapping NFT projects, namely BAYC and MAYC, the medium market cap for Blur’s top five is 270,109 ETH, while OpenSea’s medium market cap for its top five is 94,400 at time of press Tuesday. Blur having a higher medium market cap for its top five NFT collections suggests professional NFT traders are using Blur more often than OpenSea.  Nansen’s “Simian Psychometric Enhancement Technician” Andrew Thurman said to CoinDesk over Telegram, “Blur wins certain high-volume collections, like Apes and derivatives, and dominates with Azukis. OpenSea has broader reach with new collections and things like the Sewer Passes.”  Sales and wallets  Blur has attained more than 25% of OpenSea’s volume, and yet the number of NFT sales and wallets on Blur’s marketplace dwindles in comparison to OpenSea, indicating that NFT traders with large holdings prefer Blur’s no-fee marketplace more.  The number of sales on Blur for the week ending on Feb. 6 stood at 20,603, roughly 9% of OpenSea’s total number of sales, which sits around 228,000, according to Nansen data. And when looking at the number of wallets interacting with the two NFT marketplaces, a similar trend emerges: The number of wallets interacting with OpenSea is 11 times greater than those plugged into Blur, demonstrating how OpenSea dominates Blur.  “In aggregate, this tells me [OpenSea] is dominating with retail traders and volume still, but big-budget whales looking to flip more expensive pieces are taking their business to Blur,” Thurman told CoinDesk via Telegram.  Blur, after months of consistently airdropping its BLUR tokens to users for various levels of engagement, has said it would launch its BLUR governance token on Feb. 14.

While shares of Hut 8 ( HUT ) initially rose before the bell, the stock later fell as much as 11.3% . Crypto miners have been battling liquidity issues owing to last year's market downturn. The sector has seen some consolidation in recent months, with companies selling crypto holdings, mining rigs and other assets to free up capital. Others are working on restructuring debt. ""The crypto miner space will see more consolidations as the short-term crypto outlook remains filled with regulatory and contagion risks,"" said OANDA analyst Edward Moya. However, bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) rally this year (up ~40% YTD) has renewed optimism in the industry. The top crypto is currently down 0.2% at $22.92K. Interestingly, Hut 8 ( HUT ) CEO Jaime Leverton said the firm will cover operating costs by selling BTC mined and HODLed, and/or by exploring debt options. Once the merger closes, Hut 8 ( HUT ) will review its go-forward treasury strategy.

The Central Asian country has been struggling to meet electricity demand as bitcoin miners, including illegal operators, flocked to its territory in the past couple of years, putting a strain on the grid infrastructure. Though still hoping to develop its broader ecosystem, the country is tightening regulations for miners.  The new law allows miners to consume electricity from the national grid only when there is a surplus, effectively capping the industry's energy usage. The surplus will be distributed among licensed operators, who will be able to bid for the power. Those miners using renewable energy, imported electricity, or their own energy generation capacity not connected to the grid, will be exempt from this cap.  The legislation mandates that miners be licensed by authorities and makes some minor adjustments to the taxation regime for the industry.  The government will also be approving a list of mining pools that firms can use, and will oblige miners to sell their mined crypto to crypto exchanges registered with the country's special economic zone, the Astana International Finance Center. Miners will have to sell half of their crypto to such exchanges by 2024, and 75% by 2025.  Kazakhstan is also looking to regulate digital assets exchanges in the wake of the FTX fiasco.

42411229,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKGG,1675792994,‘It’s Time for Crypto to Put on Big Boy Pants’: 5 Ways TradFi Investors Are Rethinking Crypto in the Wake of FTX,"Crypto's future depends upon traditional finance (TradFi) investors. I'm not talking about banks and asset managers but the pension funds, endowments, foundations and large family offices that control large pools of discretionary, patient capital. If crypto is to realize its transformative potential, it needs these institutional investors to start writing checks.  To understand how these investors view crypto, I asked 15 asset owners, none of whom could even be remotely described as a crypto zealot and each responsible for managing or advising multibillion-dollar portfolios, ""Given the events of 2022, what would give you the confidence to invest in crypto-related opportunities, and what type of opportunity would you consider?"" I added the caveat that their answer could not be ""better regulation.""  Angelo Calvello, Ph.D., is co-founder of Rosetta Analytics, an investment manager that uses deep reinforcement learning to build and manage investment strategies for institutional investors.  Their responses revealed five key insights for the future of crypto:  'Crypto and blockchain are here to stay.'  This group's confidence was not shaken by the crypto-related events of the 2022 ""pullback"" of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other coins, the crypto credit crisis or the ensuing contagion. Their reactions to these events ranged from sanguine (""the events of 2022 … do not mean much to me or crypto"") to fatalistic (""it [crypto] will bomb a few more times before it becomes institutional before we can trust actors know what they are doing"") to gleeful (""I'm all for the crash""), with several others viewed the events as a ""necessary capitulation"" that would result in a better, healthier ecosystem. More generally, none thought 2022 spelled the death of crypto. On the contrary, they generally agreed with an endowment chief investment officer (CIO) that ""crypto and blockchain are here to stay."" However, they all agree that for them to commit meaningful capital to crypto, the future of crypto must look much different from the past.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Why Crypto Is Not an 'Industry'  'Cryptocurrencies are a solution in search of a problem.'  The future of crypto will not include investments in cryptocurrency trading strategies, according to the allocators. The managing director at a large family office forcefully pointed out that ""we have no interest in crypto as a currency."" The head of alternatives at a corporate pension plan added that he viewed crypto trading as ""degenerate gambling.""  The group also uniformly rejected the usual economic arguments for a core allocation to cryptocurrencies (it's an uncorrelated asset, a store of value, or an inflation hedge). One large endowment characterized these arguments as ""hypothetical.""  'It's time for crypto to put on big boy pants.'  The future of crypto will be good crypto businesses, not good crypto products.  For these investors, 2022 was a watershed year for crypto. While this group views crypto writ large as a transformative technology that could lead to genuine and much-needed innovation, to date, these investors view the crypto ecosystem as ""a giant crypto circle jerk that incentivizes people who contribute very little value creation."" An investment consultant described the ecosystem prosaically as a ""hobbyist industry consisting of a limited group of technically sophisticated users. … What's hot in crypto is not what institutional investors care about.""  There has been a total lack of consideration of the difference between a product and a business.  To attract institutional capital, this must change. As one family office investor told me, ""It's time for crypto to put on big boy pants. Crypto people must stop building products for other crypto people."" Another allocator added that “We're at a stage of dreaming and optimism.” A person responsible for venture capital investments at a family office said that moving from illusion to reality requires the ecosystem to start building ""Web3 solutions (infrastructure plus applications) that are better than current solutions at solving real world problems outside of the Web3 ecosystem/echo chamber (faster, cheaper, better user experience, better ability to capture value, etc.).""  Allocators agreed that to qualify for an allocation, these solutions must be supported by definable, sustainable business models. (And just for clarity, these business models are not decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO): ""DAOs are not a way to run a business and what the hell is a governance token?"")  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Crypto Technology’s Impact Goes Beyond Crypto Technology  These institutional allocators have grown weary of the pitches from crypto evangelists and consultants that ""show a total lack of consideration of the difference between a product and a business."" One allocator was unequivocal: ""This year, when I hear a crypto pitch I will stop the speaker and ask them if there's a business model. In the past few years, there has been a total lack of consideration of the difference between a product and a business.""  Critically, all agree that the business model must be scalable. For one allocator, this means ""decentralized projects and investment opportunities aimed at the general public that more effectively distribute the economics of behavior better than centralized alternatives."" Another asset owner was more specific: These must be ""projects and investments with a total addressable market of 10 million or 100 million people,"" adding for emphasis that ""crypto needs its browser moment.""  'We need a generational change for crypto and the underlying technology to be adopted.'  The future is far away. Allocators identified several structural barriers that will impede their deployment of capital, including the difficulty and time it will take to build sustainable, scalable crypto businesses and the opposition of legacy institutions that benefit from centralized structures.  Read more: Glenn Williams - Crypto Long & Short: Bitcoin's Hedge Potential  Several also identified a less obvious but more formidable barrier: institutional investors' current worldview. These allocators assert that broad-based crypto investing will require a two-part ""generational shift."" For decades, TradFi allocators' investment worldview has been circumscribed by the canon codified in CFA and MBA curricula, which, as the CIO of a public pension plan said, ""do not support crypto-related investments … If we get rid of these ideas, in five years, we'd have innovation, the innovation we desperately need.""  Second, investors need to move beyond their ethnocentrism and realize that developing markets, especially ""the great unbanked"" in the global south, will likely be the source and beneficiaries of many scalable investment opportunities. An investment consultant pointed out, ""an investment committee in Boston is not thinking about crypto in the same way as young people in the Global South.""  'It is absurd what passes for due diligence.'  The future must include better due diligence. Confidence that crypto investment opportunities are grounded in sound, scalable business models requires rigorous due diligence. This group generally gains private market exposure through funds, so they expect their fund managers to use proprietary, time-tested diligence processes to vet crypto investments thoroughly.  Crypto people must stop building products for other crypto people.  Yet, the failure of many well-regarded funds and asset owners to identify (or to just ignore) the numerous red flags associated with crypto lender Celsius Network and the FTX exchange has caused these allocators to lose some confidence in their funds’ general partner's diligence processes. For example, an endowment CIO said, ""It is absurd what passes for due diligence.""  The managing director of investments at a Canadian pension plan agreed: ""A lot of people got really lazy, and they didn't go deep enough.""  These allocators acknowledge that crypto investment opportunities present unique challenges that require specific knowledge that even the most sophisticated investors might lack. Referencing Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec's investment in Celsius and Ontario Teachers' Pension Fund's investment in FTX, the CIO of a U.S. public pension fund pithily noted, ""Not even the Canadians are capable of doing the due diligence on something they don't understand.""  More generally, many share the view of a corporate pension fund CIO that funds are putting undue pressure on limited partners to make an allocation decision: ""A lot of the deals are going so fast that you get a call, and you have to make a decision almost immediately and, as a fiduciary, FOMO is not a reason to invest."" Another pointed out, ""FOMO only works when you have a tailwind.""  This informal survey reveals that while institutional investors are bearish on cryptocurrency investment strategies, they are long-term bullish on crypto as a transformative technology, provided the technology is demonstrably scalable and supported by a viable business model. Sourcing these technology-based opportunities will require a shift in their worldview; vetting them will require an improvement in their due diligence.  The crypto ecosystem historically has chafed under the yoke of TradFi conventions, but this yoke is one it must shoulder to earn the trust necessary to attract the institutional capital necessary to transform itself from a guild into an industry.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Angelo Calvello,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/07/its-time-for-crypto-to-put-on-big-boy-pants-5-ways-tradfi-investors-are-rethinking-crypto-in-the-wake-of-ftx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d76363a7ccdff2799f48d85ed41a012b872aea8d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412917,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl70Pu,1675792544,Bitcoin Rises to $23.3K as Jerome Powell Repeats 'Disinflationary Process' Comment,"While the ""disinflationary process"" has started, it will take a good deal of time before the U.S. Federal Reserve is ready to declare victory in its fight against rising price levels, said Chairman Jerome Powell, discussing the economy with Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein.  Rubenstein wasted no time in the interview, leading off by asking if Friday's blowout jobs report (517,000 jobs added) might have changed the Fed's decision two days earlier to hike its benchmark federal funds rate by just 25 basis points. Powell said the news wouldn't have been likely to have made a difference.  Powell's post-meeting press conference last week was notable for sending both traditional markets and bitcoin (BTC) sharply higher when he said the ""disinflationary process has started."" He stuck with that phrase on Tuesday afternoon, but emphasized that the process is only starting and more rate hikes will be necessary.

The bitcoin supply ""in profit,"" which is the percentage of existing coins whose price at the time they last moved was lower than the current price, has increased since the start of the year, according to data from Glassnode. The indicator has increased by over 20% since early January.  “This implies that larger and longer-term investors currently hold profitable on-paper spot positions,” Bitfinex analysts wrote in a report. “This trend is healthy for the latter half of a bear market as a sustained 30-day uptrend after an extensive downtrend on this indicator has historically provided a good buy signal for the following two years,” the report added.  Although bitcoin and the wider crypto market have been trading well below the all-time highs reached in November 2021, the crypto market has witnessed a positive upward trend over the past three months with bitcoin rising 50% over the last three months.  On-chain data also suggests ""HODLer"" (HODLers are considered long-term holders of the cryptocurrency) conviction is high, with the Reserve Risk for bitcoin recently falling to its lowest level ever.  Reserve Risk is a cyclical oscillator that models the ratio between the current price and the conviction of long-term investors, according to the Bitfinex report. The indicator trades at low levels when there is heavy investor accumulation and HODLing is the preferred market strategy.  “The current price is the incentive to sell and the conviction in the ratio is a series of sub-metrics that factor in the opportunity cost of not selling.

While the central bank has made no decision on using distributed ledger technology (DLT) which is currently used for cryptos, Cunliffe said experimentation with decentralized record-keeping is ""important to ensure it is appropriately considered.""  The Bank of England, along with the U.K.'s finance ministry, opened a consultation on Tuesday, inviting public opinions on plans for a central bank digital currency. While U.K. banks responded to the news with concerns about bank runs, the consultation document laid out plans to cap individual holdings of the digital currency at between 10,000 (US $11,900) and 20,000 British pounds.  Cunliffe reiterated the need for caps for ""keeping outflows from the banking system broadly within the assumptions set out in the Bank’s earlier modeling work"" during his Tuesday speech. In response to a question, he said U.K. citizens should be able to receive their salary and pension in digital pounds to make sure it's useful.  The bank also envisions fiat-backed private crypto like stablecoins – which the U.K. is planning to regulate under its upcoming Financial Services and Markets Bill – operating alongside the digital pound for payments.  ""The proposals set out today are designed to ensure that the U.K. is well placed to take advantage of the benefits that these changes can offer, while ensuring that we preserve the safety and uniformity of money in the U.K.,"" Cunliffe said.

The EPA has the authority to collect emissions data from all firms above that threshold, and at least two miners, Greenidge Generation (GREE) and Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG), generated around 10 times more than the minimum in 2021.  However, the two firms have their own fossil fuel power-generation assets, meaning their emissions are not necessarily representative of the industry's.  The lawmakers also asked when the agencies plan to collect and analyze information on the industry's environmental and social impact, as recommended by the White House's Office for Science and Technology Policy in September.  The letter was signed by Senators Warren, Richard J. Durbin (D-Illinois), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Jeffrey A. Merkley (D-Ore.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), as well as House of Representatives members Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Katie Porter (D-Calif.).  The lawmakers revealed in their letter that the EPA and Energy Dept. had told them of a plan to reach out to miners via lobbying group Digital Chamber of Commerce to train them on how to use Energy Star program’s Portfolio Manager tool, which is often used to benchmark the energy consumption of commercial buildings.

Turkish singer Haluk Levent’s charity Ahbap is leading the response with roughly $2 million in crypto donations raised on the Avalanche, BSC and Ethereum blockchains in less than a day. Local exchange Paribu is also fundraising for two nonprofits assisting in the response.  On Twitter, Levent claimed the addresses had been approved by Turkey’s Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK) in spite of the ban of crypto payments by the nation's central bank in April 2021. MASAK did not immediately comment.  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, also pledged to airdrop $100 per Turkish user in BNB, Binance’s native token, a sum worth roughly $5 million.  The effort is the latest example of crypto being used to crowdfund cross-border responses. Ukraine’s government raised millions of dollars for its war effort after Russia invaded in February last year.  At press time, AVAX, Avalanche’s native token, makes up 55.56% of total donations sent to the Ahbap’s cryptocurrency addresses, worth some $1.1 million, per Nansen. The Avalanche foundation had pledged $1 million.  Moreover, 42.65% of total donations come from a variety of stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an asset such as the U.S. dollar.

42412936,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl72i6,1675784591,Crypto Lender SALT Raises $64.4M to Resume Operations,"SALT Lending has closed a $64.4 million Series A funding round from a share sale to accredited investors less than three months after a planned sale fell through due to the implosion of centralized crypto exchange FTX. SALT will use the capital toward new products and its growth strategy, according to a draft press release provided to CoinDesk.  A Feb. 3 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows SALT sold Series A preferred shares to existing borrowers and lenders to the company in exchange for the conversion and cancelation of SALT's outstanding debt.  In November, online investing platform Bnk To The Future terminated its planned acquisition of SALT Lending after the latter informed customers it would pause withdrawals and deposits on its platform due to an unspecified exposure to FTX. This new funding was to recapitalize SALT’s balance sheet and capital reserves. Subject to regulatory approval, SALT is working to return to full operations during the first quarter of this year.  Founded in 2016, Denver-based SALT offers blockchain-backed loans where borrowers put up cryptocurrency as collateral. The past year has seen the collapse of crypto lenders BlockFi, Celsius Network and CoinDesk sister company Genesis Global Trading as the bear market and wave of collapses revealed insolvency and some illegal activities such as re-loaning customer funds. The collapses tinged all crypto lenders with a degree of suspicion.  “Crypto faced a perfect winter storm in 2022, taking with it significant industry participants like Terraform Labs, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital, FTX, and BlockFi. SALT was not immune to these market forces, but we are determined to emerge stronger than ever,” said SALT founder and interim CEO Shawn Owen in a statement. “Despite facing an unprecedented situation and, frankly, an existential threat, we have embarked on a growth plan that we believe positions us for even greater success in the future.”  Emerging from the FTX contagion  In an interview with CoinDesk last week, Owen said SALT initially saw a huge opportunity as the bull market of 2021 gave way to a bear market early last year. While the implosions of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and Celsius “put the words ‘crypto lending’ front and center – in a bad way,” Owen said SALT entered into its merger agreement in part because Bnk To The Future agreed with its plan to bid on Celsius assets to try and find a solution to the once high-yield lender’s downfall.  However, the FTX collapse that began in early November caught the market – and SALT – off-guard. SALT said it agreed to calling off the merger to focus on the problem at hand. As the FTX contagion spread, SALT decided to “just get out of the market, shut everything down, protect our customers and reassess,” said Owen. The platform wasn’t designed to shut down in that way, and the user base was left spooked. SALT spent the aftermath talking to its base to try and restore confidence.  Asked how crypto lenders can win back nervous customers, Owen said the answer is transparency and providing proof of reserves, noting that his company is raising more money than it otherwise might have in order to build a surplus.  “We've completely opened up and just been more transparent than ever,” said Owen. “The tone out in the market seems to be extremely cautious, people feeling like they were taken advantage of or that they didn't know what's going on or they're told one thing and something else happened.”  Read more: Why Do Crypto Lenders Keep Blowing Up?

42393908,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3V5,1675784262,‘Crypto Mom’ Hester Peirce: SEC ‘Disappoints’ When It Comes to Crypto,"Speak to Hester Peirce for too long and you’ll leave with the distinct impression that she’s fed up with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The U.S.’ securities, and sometimes crypto, regulator “has not done a good job,” the commissioner told CoinDesk. “We just haven't made progress in the five years I've been here.”  Peirce, sometimes referred to as Crypto Mom by those in the sector, is quick to rattle off the agency’s failures: The SEC has not provided enough clarity on how it regulates cryptocurrency companies, established the kind of regulatory framework that attracts crypto business in the U.S. and not protected Americans from dodgy companies that operate outside of its clutch.  Robert Stevens is a freelance journalist whose work has appeared in Fortune, The Guardian, the Associated Press and Decrypt.  “If we had a better framework in the U.S. [for crypto], I think you would see more activity happening [here]. But now people have so many questions that a lot of stuff ends up happening outside of the United States. And that means that when U.S. persons participate, they won't have the protection of the U.S. regulatory framework,” she said.  The SEC’s mandate is to protect U.S. retail investors and regulate fair and orderly markets. But last year a string of collapses led to the bankruptcy filings of FTX, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, BlockFi and CoinDesk sister company Genesis – leaving their millions of customers in the lurch.  Peirce declined to discuss the collapse of the Bahamas-based FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried because they are the subjects of ongoing lawsuits launched by the SEC.  The commissioner has complained about the way the agency regulates in the crypto sphere since her term began during the presidency of Donald Trump. In 2020 she told Decrypt, just after being sworn in for a second term, that patchy SEC guidance made things even more complicated for crypto companies.  The 2019 FinHub Framework, for instance, laid out how to determine whether a cryptocurrency network is decentralized – and therefore whether a network can avoid the SEC's wrath. But the measure left “too many ambiguities” to be practically applicable,” she said. “I don't know that it's really even being applied.”  Regulation hasn’t moved along a whole lot since then. When Peirce’s new boss, Gary Gensler, became the SEC chair in April 2021 under President Joe Biden, he continued the agency’s longstanding policy of “regulation through litigation,” where companies learn of their infractions when the SEC sues them for breaking the law.  See also: SEC's Gensler Holds Firm That Existing Laws Make Sense for Crypto / Opinion  Last year, the regulator sued BlockFi for $100 million over its interest-bearing crypto account, and just last month lodged complaints against Genesis and Gemini for selling unregistered securities. Gensler told Yahoo Finance in December that the SEC has brought over 100 crypto enforcement cases against crypto-related companies.  But while Peirce, who declined to comment on Gensler’s tenure, said enforcement actions are “important work,” she said the agency has not created “an environment within which good activity can flourish.”  Some of the complications of trying to write a regulatory policy through enforcement actions are apparent with the BlockFi settlement, she said. “If we had simply been more proactive in a regulatory way on crypto lending, we could have had a framework in place that would have applied to everyone,” she said.  Such a framework could have “taken into account a wide range of views about what the right approach was there.”  Peirce pointed a finger at her colleagues who “don’t think that any clarity is needed.” Her peers “think there’s plenty of clarity” – and do not see much point in regulating crypto, a technology they do not consider useful.  “It's disappointing,” she said. “I've been here for five years now and I've seen very few proactive steps toward trying to [in advance] set up a regulatory regime that makes sense.” Her hope is for crypto builders to spend time thinking about things other than regulation. ”You can't have this system where everyone is unable to move forward because everything is so ambiguous.”  Pierce’s own efforts include a proposal to give three years to development teams to decentralize their projects before the SEC can sue them. The bill, sometimes called the token safe harbor, was introduced in February 2020, revised in 2021 and never gained traction within her own agency.  However, its spirit was contained within the Clarity for Digital Tokens Act of 2021 introduced in Congress by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R–N.C.), a longstanding advocate of crypto regulation who in December was became chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. But that bill died last month after little fanfare.  Congress is still deciding other matters – such as if crypto companies should be subject to restrictions on how they handle customer assets, whether the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should play a greater role in regulating crypto and whether the Federal Reserve should be able to license stablecoin issuers.  While Peirce hopes that Congress resolves these issues, she said the SEC is often the “natural regulator” of crypto, plus the exchanges on which these currencies are traded – so long as you believe that most cryptocurrencies are securities, as the SEC does.  See also: What If Regulators Wrote Rules for Crypto? / Opinion  Still, she thinks there is space to do some of the groundwork together with the CFTC. “They have some valuable experience that would be useful in helping Congress through the right approach,” Peirce said.  Yet “the agency itself has never handled innovation very well,” she said of the SEC. “It's just not our strong point.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/07/crypto-mom-hester-peirce-sec-disappoints-when-it-comes-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/925018fd1c811ea84b40137b690e1bc518b4ec21-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412949,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl72uG,1675782888,Ethereum Testnet Processes First   ETH Staking Withdrawals,"An Ethererum test network (testnet) successfully simulated withdrawals of staked ether (ETH) for the first time, bringing the second-biggest blockchain yet another step closer to its historic transition to a fully featured proof-of-stake network. The upgrade was triggered at epoch 1350 at 15:00 UTC and finalized at 15:13 UTC. (10:13 a.m. ET).  The testnet, known as Zhejiang, facilitated the withdrawal simulations early Tuesday after going live last week, according to an explorer website set up to track transactions on the system. The test network is designed to provide developers with a dress rehearsal of the withdrawals similar to those that will happen on the main Ethereum blockchain following its long-awaited Shanghai upgrade, expected next month.  Read more: What Is the Ethereum Blockchain’s Shanghai Hard Fork, and Why Does It Matter?  ""On the Zhejiang testnet, partial and full withdrawals as well as BLS changes are included in the execution payload,"" Barnabas Busa, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk. ""We have a successful fork."" BLS changes allow people to change their withdrawal credentials to properly process staked ether withdrawals.  Zhejiang is the first of three testnets to run through a simulation of Shanghai. Testnets duplicate the main blockchain, and allow developers and users to test any code changes to their applications in a low-stakes environment.  The next testnet upgrade will happen sometime in the next few weeks to Sepolia, followed by Goerli.  Shanghai will be the first hard fork for Ethereum since it went through the Merge in September, which officially marked the blockchain’s transition to a proof-of-stake network. The transition made Ethereum more energy-efficient than when it used the proof-of-work system used by the Bitcoin blockchain. Under a proof-of-stake network, cryptocurrency is deposited or “staked” on the blockchain as a mechanism for helping to secure transactions.  But until the Shanghai upgrade happens, the staking mechanism is one-way – users can put ether in but can’t take it out.  The upgrade has become a highly anticipated event for the ecosystem. Crypto traders are paying attention to how Shanghai might move the market. Some traders believe that Shanghai will encourage more staking, while other traders believe that ETH will experience a price drop due to sell pressures caused when stakers rush to withdraw their long-held funds.

The spat between Binance and Zanmai Labs, the Singapore-based parent of WazirX, is about which company truly controls the Indian exchange. The internal dispute became public in August 2022 when Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted Binance didn't control WazirX, resulting in WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty hitting back later.  In the months since then, both parties were in private discussions to work out the ownership issue, said Shetty, in order to ensure customer funds wouldn't become collateral damage.  On Jan. 26, Binance gave WazirX an ultimatum to retract what it called a ""false and misleading narrative"" or stop using Binance's wallets by Feb. 3, CoinDesk reported at the time.  In a blog post on Feb. 3, however, Binance said it was making an exception and inviting WazirX to ""work out arrangements to withdraw any remaining assets in the relevant accounts."" The solution ostensibly ended worries about what would happen to customer funds if Binance and WazirX end their collaboration, given that WazirX disclosed that 90% of its user assets are held in Binance wallets.  Later, on Feb. 3, WazirX said it had begun the process of transferring assets to multisignature wallets, and that it expects the process to be completed ""within the next few hours.""  In Tuesday's blog, and with the process of transferring funds apparently over, WazirX said its ""users do not have to be concerned about Binance’s announcement.""

Users can continue to trade, deposit, and withdraw their funds as usual.""  Binance didn't immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

42412943,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl72oe,1675778881,"Crypto Protocol Lido Proposes ‘Turbo,’ ‘Bunker’ Modes for Post-Shanghai Ether Withdrawals","Lido, the leading Ethereum liquid staking platform, disclosed a proposal on Tuesday for an upgrade designed to help decentralize the project while establishing procedures for users to redeem staked ether following next month’s Shanghai upgrade.  The two proposals included in the upgrade will be put up for a vote to the Lido decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) community sometime this month, according to a draft blog post shared with CoinDesk.  The launch of Lido’s version (v)2 upgrade hews closely to the timeline for Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which will enable staking withdrawals in the Ethereum ecosystem.  In the weeks leading up to Shanghai, the Lido community will participate in the snapshot vote, followed by testing on Ethereum’s Goerli testnet in March. The actual v2 upgrade will go live at the end of March or early April, according to the draft blog post.  What does Lido’s v2 upgrade include?  The staking router proposal aims to help diversify Lido’s validators.  According to the draft blog post, the staking router “is a controller contract that would allow Lido to evolve into an extensible protocol via a modular infrastructure.”  Eugene Pshenichnyy, a core contributor at Lido, told CoinDesk: “It's actually a piece of technology that would allow Lido to decentralize” its validators.  The withdrawal proposal will enable Lido users to unstake their stETH and, in return, receive ETH at a 1:1 ratio, according to the post.  The proposal sets up two “modes” for processing withdrawals on Lido once staked ETH withdrawals are enabled on Ethereum.  The default mode, known as “Turbo mode,” will process withdrawal requests quickly and uses all the available ETH collected from deposits and rewards.  In the event that there is high network activity or an unforeseen “catastrophic” event, the protocol will turn towards “Bunker mode.”  “Its purpose is to prevent sophisticated actors from gaining an unfair advantage against other stakers by delaying withdrawals in the whole protocol and socializing the negative impact,” according to the post.  Once the Lido community votes on these two proposals, developers will start a trial, and follow the timeline closely of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade so it occurs simultaneously.

Under a cash squeeze as the bitcoin bear market combines with spiking energy prices, Stronghold has struck deals since last summer with its lenders to reduce immediate debt obligations as it seeks to avoid the Chapter 11 bankruptcy fate of peers Compute North and Core Scientific (CORZ).  This latest agreement, with WhiteHawk Finance on $55 million of debt, releases the miner of all amortization payments until July 2024, which otherwise would have required the payment of $1.6 million per month (totaling $29 million through June 2024), according to a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, the company won't have to make any payments at all until June. Beginning then, Stronghold will make payments based on a monthly cash sweep calculated as 50% of the company's average daily cash balance for each month in excess of $7.5 million, the filing said.  The new credit agreement also reduces Stronghold's minimum liquidity covenants until the end of 2024 and allows the miner to pay for its interest in kind for up to six months, as long as its average daily cash balance for the respective month is less than $5 million.  Stronghold also signed a two-year deal with miner hosting company Foundry for 4,500 miners, totaling approximately 420 petahash/second in computing power with an average efficiency of 35 joules/terahash.

Webacy is a technology layer rather than a competitor for crypto wallets like MetaMask. The technology allows users to access their existing self-custodial wallets without the need for keys, seed phrases or passwords and provides security features to reduce the risk of assets being lost or stolen, a common problem in crypto. Last month, Kevin Rose, CEO and co-founder of non-fungible token (NFT) collective Proof, revealed the hack of his personal wallet with 40 high-value collectibles.  “To welcome the next billion users to Web3, we’ll need a safe environment that allows everyone to transact and own assets with the power to protect themselves.

42412953,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl72y0,1675777025,"Digital Pound Holdings Could Be Limited to 10K, Central Bank Says","U.K. citizens could be limited to holding 10,000 British pounds (US$11,900) each in a new digital pound, as the Bank of England seeks to avoid a new central bank digital currency undermining the banking system.  The central bank appeared to favor centralized databases over the blockchain as it seeks a technological basis for the digital currency, which officials said on Monday would be likely to be needed.  ""The Bank would place some limits on holdings of digital pounds, at least during its introductory period,"" to avoid citizens hoarding their assets in safe central bank money and skirting around the commercial banking system, a consultation published today by the central bank and U.K. Treasury said. ""We judge that a limit of between 10,000 and 20,000 [pounds] per individual is likely to strike an appropriate balance between managing risks and supporting wide usability of the digital pound.""  The range of holdings would allow 75%-95% of U.K. earners to take their salary without breaching holding limits, the document said, but could vary by individual, it added, citing differences based on region, age and gender.  U.K. banks on Tuesday expressed concern that the central bank digital currency (CBDC) could effectively encourage a bank run as customers move to hold central bank money directly, perceived as the safest form of asset.  A separate technical paper published by the central bank said distributed ledger technologies that underlie crypto and blockchain-based solutions ""might have advantages in guaranteeing consistency and resilience,"" while presenting ""privacy, scalability and security challenges.""  ""Centrally governed, distributed database technologies might achieve the ledger requirements without such limitations. Therefore, these technologies might be appropriate for the core ledger design,"" the technical paper said.  The central bank appears to take a cautious view on the ability to pre-program how funds can be used. While it could allow money held in trust to be released when smart contract conditions are met, or ensuring taxes get paid automatically, that functionality also changes the nature of money as a freely exchangeable good.  “The Bank will not implement central bank-initiated programmable functions,” the technical document said. “Instead, the Bank would provide the necessary infrastructure for the private sector to implement programmability features for users. Those features would require user consent.”  The central bank said it would allow private sector companies – such as those providing anti-money laundering checks on wallets or offering analytics services – to offer programmability on top of central bank infrastructure, but said any functions shouldn’t reduce simplicity or performance.  Regulated private intermediaries would have privileged access to the central bank’s core infrastructure, the consultation said – but personal holdings will appear on the central bank’s ledger, not on the balance sheet of the wallet provider.  ""The digital pound would have at least the same level of privacy as a bank account and would also allow users to make choices about data use,” the consultation said.  It won’t be anonymous, but neither the government nor the central bank will have access to personal data, and the police will have access only on a “fair and lawful basis.” The central bank said it is still considering how to set limits if corporations, and even financial firms, should get access to the digital currency, too.  The consultation is open for comment until June 7.

The spike reflects the platform’s significant ecosystem growth in 2022, particularly during the fourth quarter. The token began to climb at the beginning of 2023 after plummeting in the second half of 2022, and is now trading at around $0.17, up 94% over the last seven days. GRT in 2021 had risen above $5 billion in market value before spiraling lower as the wider crypto market started tumbling late that year.  Binance is temporarily suspending U.S. dollar bank transfers starting on Wednesday, the company confirmed to CoinDesk on Monday. ""We are temporarily suspending USD bank transfers as of February 8th,"" a Binance spokesperson said, noting just 0.01% of monthly active users use USD bank transfers. ""Affected customers are being notified directly."" ""In the interim, all other methods of buying and selling crypto remain unaffected, including bank transfer using one of the other fiat currencies supported by Binance (including euros), buying and selling crypto via credit card, debit card, Google Pay and Apple Pay and via our Binance P2P marketplace,"" the spokesperson added. Binance.US is not affected by the suspension, the exchange later said.  Crypto friendly lender Signature Bank faces a putative class-action suit for its involvement in the operations of now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Statistica Capital, an algorithmic trading firm, claims the bank ""had actual knowledge of and substantially facilitated the now-infamous FTX fraud,"" according to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. ""In particular, Signature knew of and permitted the commingling of FTX customer funds within its proprietary, blockchain-based payments network, Signet.""

42412954,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl72yw,1675774800,Central Banks Are Working on a Monitoring System for Stablecoin Balance Sheets,"The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the association of the world’s central banks, is spearheading the development of a monitoring system for stablecoins to ensure issuers maintain adequate reserves.  Named Project Pyxtrial, the program will also investigate tech tools to help regulators form data-based policy frameworks, BIS said on Tuesday as it unveiled its work program for 2023. A stablecoin is a crypto token whose value is linked to the value of other assets such as sovereign currencies, and its ability to keep its peg is linked to strength of its balance sheet.  While central banks worldwide have been heads-down on projects that experiment with digital versions of sovereign currencies (CBDC), the stablecoin project is a first, and illustrates a growing concern among regulators. While CBDCs are viewed by some central bankers as a more secure alternative to volatile private cryptocurrencies, stablecoins promise the stability of the U.S. dollar or euro, and make up the bedrock of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications – something regulators haven’t yet figured out how to supervise.  “Most central banks lack tools to systemically monitor stablecoins and avoid asset-liability mismatches,"" the BIS said in the statement. ""The project will investigate various technological tools that may help supervisors and regulators to build policy frameworks based on integrated data.”  The program will kick off this year at the BIS’ Innovation Hub in London, BIS said. Revelations from 2021 on the makeup of stablecoin reserves like Tether's USDT and last year's collapse of algorithmic stablecoin UST have also put regulators on high alert. The BIS, which is made up of 63 central banks, has innovation centers scattered across the globe working on 15 different experiments involving CBDCs, the program showed.  The 2023 program focuses heavily on how central bank digital currencies could improve payments systems. The BIS is also working on monitoring systems for crypto and DeFi with Project Atlas, the announcement said.  Other standard setters such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures are also looking into crypto and stablecoin supervision.

The chain's governance token has been one of the best performers in crypto - up 200% YTD. Tokenomics are less than ideal and the network activity has fallen dramatically since a recent growth campaign wrapped up. Optimism ( OP-USD ) is one of the most popular layer two scaling chains built on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Optimism has integration with dozens of DeFi protocols and is home to some of the more popular applications in crypto; Synthetix ( SNX-USD ), for instance. OP has been one of the best performing crypto assets in 2023, now up roughly 200% year to date: YTD (Seeking Alpha) As we'll explore in this article, OP's performance seems to be more of a news-related move than a fundamental one. It appears the biggest catalyst that is likely creating the current price surge in OP is the impending vote for Optimism's 'Bedrock' upgrade that is expected take place on the Optimism Mainnet in the coming weeks. Bedrock has successfully been implemented on the Goerli Testnet and when finished on Mainnet will bring significant techincal improvements in the L2 chain according to the team working on the upgrade: The Bedrock release enables performance improvements across the board, including transaction costs, throughput characteristics, and sync speeds. According to the chain's developers, the successful implementation of Bedrock on the Optimism's Mainnet will position the ecosystem as a leader in Ethereum scaling. OP Tokenomics In the past, Optimism has operated without a native coin. However, last year OP was launched as a pure governance token rather than as a traditional utility token. This means Optimism users don't pay gas fees with OP. From a token supply standpoint, there is a lot of potential dilution coming - this data is according to CoinMarketCap: Total Token Supply: 4.3 billion Circulating Supply: 235 million (5.4%) Token Price: $3.01 Market capitalization: $707 million Fully diluted cap: $12.8 billion Market Cap Rank: 69 The first thing that probably jumps out from those metrics is the circulating supply. At 5.4%, that circulating supply is preposterously low. This has two fairly large impacts on the coin. First, with less supply in circulation there is a greater chance for volatility. This is what explains the 200% surge in a little over a month. Second, if tokens that come out of lockup end up entering the market too quickly, it could drastically deflate the price of OP tokens. Though just 5% of supply is in circulation from the airdrop at launch, over 30% is actually out of lockup since we're currently in Year 0. Unlock Schedule (Optimism) Later in 2023, we'll see the release schedule add some of the tokens from early investors and core contributors. This is where OP investors today could possibly see price deflation if the early money looks to get out of the investment after such a marvelous increase in price. In total, 17% of the tokens went to early investors (or ""Sugar Xaddies"") and 19% went to core contributors. Token Allocation (Optimism) 19% is for airdrops and the rest is for building the ecosystem and public goods funding. Which are tokens that are apparently being held for distribution to developers and startup builders who help grow the ecosystem after they have created something meaningful for the public good of the chain rather than before. Which in my view is actually a smarter way to release funds that are similar to grants. Network Adoption? OP was already moving very nicely in January but it was actually the February 1st announcement that the community will be voting on the Bedrock upgrade that really sent the token skyward from $2 up over $3 in a matter of just a few days. But from where I sit, it really looks like speculation is what is driving this price increase in OP rather than actual chain usage. In fact, daily transactions on Optimism have actually declined by about 75% since mid-January's 800k high: Dune Analytics/Blockworks We can see Arbitrum taking the L2 lead back from Optimism in daily transactions again in the middle of January. The drop off in transactions on Optimism is particularly notable because it appears to coincide with the conclusion of a ""quest"" program that the Optimism team had been running since September of last year to facilitate adoption of the chain. The program awarded users with NFTs for exploring the ecosystem. One could certainly argue then that the activity on-chain had been inorganic and may not ultimately return without another similar program. Optimism TVL (DeFi Llama) Despite that, Optimism does still command a top 10 TVL with just under $790 million in total value locked. Furthermore, the DeFi trend on Optimism is actually pretty good having increased from $500 million on January 1st to $715 on February 1st. That 43% TVL growth was the strongest of any top 10 smart contract chain by percentage over that time. What is also a positive sign is the low protocol dominance from Velodrome at just under 21%. This insinuates a DeFi ecosystem that is more diverse than peers. However, it does stand to reason that many of Optimism's DeFi users could be simply engaging with the chain to position themselves for future token airdrops from the OP airdrop fund. Summary The growth of Optimism's network over the last several months has been terrific. This is particularly impressive because we've been in crypto winter and the ecosystem has grown in spite of. I like that a lot. But it is definitely concerning how fast daily transactions on Optimism fell back to pre-Quest levels. That doesn't mean a similar activity level can't ultimately come back and growth initiatives like Optimism's Quest campaign aren't uncommon. Fundamentally, Bedrock is an interesting potential catalyst as it would enable a modular approach to the chain that will allow for transaction batching - they say this would lower fees and improve chain speed dramatically. That would be great for users of the network as speed and reduced fees are the entire point of layer 2s. All this said, from a straight investment perspective, pure play governance coins aren't generally my favorite crypto investments, though I have made exceptions in the past. For OP specifically, I think there is still so much dilution remaining in the coin that it just makes more sense to buy ETH instead if you want to enjoy the fruits of Optimism's future success.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | TRADING | OP | AIRDROP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4575885-the-optimism-is-strong-in-this-one?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8991362.jpeg

42412946,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl72qW,1675771929,Shares of Bitcoin Miner Hut 8 Slump on Merger With US Bitcoin Corp.,"Shares of Hut 8 Mining (HUT) slid 9% on Nasdaq Tuesday, closing at $2.17, after the bitcoin mining firm said it agreed to merge with U.S. Bitcoin Corp.  The two firms will become wholly owned subsidiaries of the newly formed Hut 8 Corp. Shareholders of the two will each own about 50% of the merged company, they said in a Tuesday press release. The deal will have existing shares of Toronto-based Hut 8 consolidated five-to-one in the new company, which will have access to about 825 megawatts (MW) of energy capacity.  The industry has been consolidating as last year's bear market battered miners, leading to acquisition opportunities. While some miners have been able to buy new mining rigs and sites on sale, others such as Core Scientific (CORZ) have been forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  Hut 8 will gain access to hundreds of megawatts of cheap energy through the merger, while U.S. Bitcoin Corp., known as USBTC, gains a partner with a strong balance sheet. The merger will give the new U.S.-based company access to capital and the possibility of being including in indexes in the U.S., while also diversifying the geographic distribution of mining sites across North America, the press release said.  ""This transaction has given us the opportunity to leverage the significant, unencumbered bitcoin stack we have HODLed to date,"" said Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton, adding that the firm will be selling a portion of its mined bitcoin to fund operations in the interim period. The firm has been one of a few miners to continue holding on to its mined digital assets through the market downturn, amassing 9,086 BTC ($209 million) as of the end of 2022.  Hut 8 will provide secured bridge financing of as much as $6.5 million to USBTC, subject to the completion of definitive loan documentation.  USBTC operates a facility in Niagara Falls, New York, that has attracted controversy on the municipal level due to noise complaints. The firm is touting a new business model of profiting from managing mining sites. USBTC acquired a site with 220 MW of hosting capacity from bankrupt firm Compute North in King Mountain, Texas, through a joint venture with a ""leading energy partner.""  USBTC also manages two large Compute North Facilities in Kearny, Nebraska, and Granbury, Texas, totaling 400 MW of energy capacity, which were acquired by investment firm Generate Capital. Compute North has changed its name to Mining Project Wind Down Holdings as part of the bankruptcy process.  Hut 8 had 109 MW of mining capacity in Alberta, Canada, as of the end of 2022, said Erin Dermer, the firm's senior vice president of culture and communications.  Leverton will lead the new entity and her colleague Shenif Visram will be chief financial officer. From USBTC, Asher Genoot will be president and Michael Ho chief strategy officer. Hut 8's Bill Tai will be chairman.  While the boards of the two firms have both unanimously approved the deal, equity holders and court approval are still pending. The companies hope to close the deal by the end of the second quarter, Leverton said in a Tuesday call with investors.

Aave relies on smart contracts to offer users with financial services such as lending and borrowing. Its recently released version 3 (v3) product has been deployed on Ethereum and layer 2 networks Optimism and Arbitium – two separate blockchains that allow users to transact on Ethereum-based applications faster and more cheaply.  Last year, Lido said it will reward staked ether (stETH) liquidity providers on Arbitrum and Optimism with a cumulative 150,000 LDO tokens, Lido’s governance token, to attract users to the service.  These rewards will now be distributed across Aave following the vote that ended Monday. Over 99% of all governance participants voted in favor of the proposal.  Lido is a staking system for Ethereum, Solana and other networks. It is currently the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) application with a locked value of over $8.48 billion as of Tuesday.  It allows users to stake their tokens in return for daily rewards and receive a derivative token that represents the actual staked token, which users can use on other DeFi products.  A key benefit of using Lido is that users can stake any amount of ether and get rewarded, as opposed to becoming a validator on the Ethereum which requires a minimum of 32 ether – worth over $52,000 at press time – before they get any rewards.  Ethereum staking is a way for ether investors to earn a reward by locking up their coins following the Merge event last year.

The extensive rules published Tuesday detail requirements for companies from cybersecurity norms to compliance and risk-management standards. A separate set of rulebooks address specific activities like issuance, advisory, custody and exchange services.  All activities and firms fall under the supervision of the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), set up last year to oversee the sector as Dubai aims to attract crypto and blockchain companies. Since then VARA published some guidelines for crypto advertising, with plans to publish a comprehensive rulebook by the end of 2022.  ""With bespoke rules and guidelines designed to provide clarity, assure certainty, and mitigate market risks, VARA seeks to develop a model framework for global economic sustainability within an innovation-centric environment that is truly borderless, technology agnostic, and future-focused,"" the regulator said on Tuesday.  Dubai is the most populous emirate of the seven that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and nurtures big ambitions to become a regional fintech hub. Although a number of crypto companies – including the European unit of now-collapsed FTX – have claimed to have obtained VARA approval, a UAE lawmaker told a panel at the 2023 World Economic Forum in January that no companies have licenses from the watchdog.  Regulators around the world are racing to set up crypto supervision after last year's market crash saw the collapse of high profile digital asset exchange and lending platforms. The European Union is ready to approve its own licensing regime, while the U.K., South Korea and other jurisdictions are quickly forming their own frameworks.

42412941,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl72mm,1675770903,The Ordinals Protocol Has Caused a Resurgence in Bitcoin Development,"The Ordinals protocol has triggered a revival of interest in bitcoin (BTC) development and has led to an increase in average block size as more users join the network, research firm FSInsight said in a report Friday.  Ordinals is a new protocol that allows non-fungible-tokens (NFT) to be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.  NFTs could be a good source of demand for block space while the digital asset “travels up the adoption curve as money,” and the probability of these tokens fueling bitcoin’s next bull run cannot be ignored, the report said.  “Despite the loud critics from the more dogmatic side of the bitcoin ecosystem (some of which have gone as far as advocating for the censorship of transactions by miners), the benefits to the network have become immediately apparent,” wrote Sean Farrell, head of crypto strategy at FSInsight.  One reasonable criticism of bitcoin’s security model is the lack of miner revenue attributable to fees, the note said. Currently, most of the security budget paid to miners to secure the network comes from the block subsidy. The blockchain needs to figure out a way to “create a sustainable demand for block space or hope that non-economic miners commit to securing the network,” the note added.  “The excitement surrounding NFTs on Bitcoin has brought new experimentation to the network, increasing average blocks sizes overnight, which translates to higher fees per block,” the report said.  FSInsight notes that there are concerns that the inscription of non-fungible data on the blockchain could cause bloat, but says that these concerns seem generally unfounded.

Statistica Capital, an algorithmic trading firm, and Statistica Ltd. claim the bank ""had actual knowledge of and substantially facilitated the now-infamous FTX fraud,"" according to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dated Feb. 6. ""In particular, Signature knew of and permitted the commingling of FTX customer funds within its proprietary, blockchain-based payments network, Signet.""  Statistica says it advised Signature the funds were meant for FTX, but the bank allowed it to be transferred to accounts controlled by Alameda Research, the trading firm owned by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.  It was the revelation of the blurry lines between FTX and its supposedly separate sister firm Alameda that brought about FTX's swift downfall, having first been exposed by CoinDesk in early November.  FTX was one of the bank’s clients, although the crypto exchange’s deposits with Signature amounted to less than 0.1% of the bank’s overall deposits. Previously regarded as one of the Wall Street's most crypto-friendly banks, it remains to be seen whether its appetite for cryptocurrency will be soured as a result of FTX's collapse.  Signature's Nasdaq-listed shares were down less than 1% in pre-market trading.  The firm did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Statistica Capital is a British Virgin Islands-licensed company offering algorithmic trading focusing on automated strategies across different trading platforms, according to its website.

Social media and technology platforms were cited as a significant source of fraud, but executives told the Treasury Select Committee that new regulations could boost confidence.  “We have taken a pretty hard line as a bank on crypto,” Alison Rose, chief executive officer of NatWest Group, told the House of Commons committee. “We're blocking retail and wealth customers from transferring into crypto assets because of the volatility and the stability of the platform.”  “We look at it through a fraud perspective,” Rose added. “We know that can cause frustration for customers because they may want to invest – it's their money – but if we're evidencing significant fraud we block them.”  “We do need to stop it at root cause,” Rose said, citing statistics showing that, for 60% of customers who were victims, the fraud originated on social media or technology platforms.  Other executives questioned by the committee were also skeptical about crypto, but saw potential in new rules proposed for the sector by the U.K. Treasury last week.  “We're very supportive of the regulation and the regulators looking at regulation of crypto, our focus will always be about customer outcomes in that context,” said Charlie Nunn, CEO of Lloyds Bank. “I don't think Lloyds Banking Group will want to be promoting cryptocurrencies, but we do want to make sure that, if our customers choose to put money into cryptocurrencies, it's as safe as can be.”  Bank bosses appeared more skeptical about the potential benefits of a central bank digital currency – the day after the Treasury and Bank of England said a digital pound was likely to be needed, and with more details set to be published imminently.  “The most significant potential benefit is actually some reformation in the way in which the plumbing infrastructure works around payments to simplify and modernize,” said Matt Hammerstein, CEO of Barclays, but said there was a risk of a “two-tier payment system” with those who kept using cash, and of creating a bank run if people hoard digital money.  Last week the Nationwide Building Society said it was restricting card payments made by users to cryptocurrency exchange Binance, citing concerns over scams.

42412972,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl75W6,1675763084,DebtDAO to Burn 18M FTX User Debt Tokens Following Demand Frenzy,"Irrational exuberance from crypto traders for the newly issued FTX User Debt (FUD) tokens has resulted in volatile price swings, controversies, millions in trading volumes, and a decision to destroy a majority of the token’s supply permanently.  FUD traded as high as $113 earlier this week, exchanging hands for $65 on Tuesday morning at the crypto exchange Huobi. Data shows it started trading at just 50 cents on Feb. 4.  There is no relationship between the Tron-based FUD token and the bankrupt FTX exchange. DebtDAO has stated it would create more tokens when FTX confirms the actual debt and distribute the additional tokens through airdrops to FUD holders, who will have the first right to assert their right on the debt.  Huobi Global adviser Justin Sun explained the token offering in a tweet last week. ""FUD token provides creditors with a new level of liquidity, allowing them to trade their FTX debt on the open market,"" Sun said, adding it ""has been confirmed"" through a contract provided by DebtDAO that the debt is in the tens of millions of dollars.  ""After FTX restores the database or FTX officially confirms the actual debt of the creditor, DebtDAO will issue a secondary public offering based on the actual amount of the debt and issue airdrops to all FUD holders,"" Sun explained.  The bond token was issued last week by DebtDAO, which it claims was on behalf of FTX creditors. The tokens had an initial supply and circulation of 20 million FUD tokens, representing 2% of FTX's debt, giving each FUD token a value of $1 and representing approximately $100 million owed to FTX creditors.  “As the most cost-effective and prioritized FTX debt on the network, FUD creditors have the first right to assert their claims on FTX debt,” DebtDAO said in a tweet last week. “Creditors with FTX debt exceeding $10 million are also encouraged to contact DebtDAO for a debt audit and issuance, enabling the debt to circulate in the secondary market.”  DebtDAO previously considered the fair value for FUD was under $1. But the price surge on Monday meant the debt was valued at over $220 million at FUD’s $113 price level. As a result, 18 million FUD tokens will be burnt on Feb. 7, to bring the debt’s valuation in line with what DebtDAO considers fair value.  “After the destruction, the total issue will become 2 million FUDs and change from the initial 1 FUD=1 USD equivalent claim to 1 FUD=10 USD equivalent claim,” Huobi said in a statement Tuesday, citing a DebtDAO proposal.

42412963,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl75RQ,1675756800,Crypto Custody Tech Firm Metaco Taps IBM Execs to Revamp Institutional Push,"Metaco, a provider of crypto custody technology, has hired former-IBM digital asset specialist Peter DeMeo and made several other key appointments as the company shrugs off tough market conditions and prepares to drive the next phase of big-business crypto adoption.  Reliable safekeeping of crypto assets is where the rubber has met the road for banks and institutions over the past couple of years. Custody has shot to prominence again in the wake of the FTX crypto exchange collapse and the failures of crypto lending platforms Celsius Network and CoinDesk sister company Genesis, among others.  DeMeo’s appointment as chief product officer matters because IBM, where he was head of digital assets infrastructure, has been quietly building out bank-grade digital assets custody and key management. (Big Blue was previously best known in the industry for its forays into supply chain applications of permissioned blockchains and the like.)  However, Metaco’s gain isn’t necessarily IBM’s loss, as DeMeo explains, because the move cements an existing working relationship between the two companies.  “It's really a win-win because IBM’s strongest partner in digital assets over the last several years has been Metaco, and now we have a real opportunity to collaborate and take things to the next level,” DeMeo said in an interview. “Metaco is agnostic and of course will be working with other cloud and hardware providers as well. So, it’s a mutually beneficial relationship, but not necessarily an exclusive relationship.”  Metaco also took on former IBM lead architect, Angel Nunez Mencias, who joins as chief customer officer. Other hires include former Accenture executive Katrin Koller as head of advisory; former PayPal and Unbound Security exec Rebecca Aspler as head of product; and Citi alum Mei Li Powell as head of marketing.  “Last year was very much about scaling the team and bringing on as much talent and seniority as we could,” CEO Adrien Treccani said in an interview. “We have tripled the size of the team and are still planning to double the size of the company this year. The hires are mainly between Europe, Southeast Asia and North America, but we do have more regions appearing with our growing user base of clients.”  Treccani and DeMeo also pointed to the newly formed research and development division, Metaco Labs. That will work on cutting edge developments to bring key sharding technology called multiparty computation (MPC) inside a hardware security module (HSM), a kind of physical computing and storage lockbox that big banks are familiar with.  “We’re going to be running MPC in the safest place on earth: a hardware security module,” said DeMeo. “Typically, you would have keys being signed off in HSMs and stored in HSMs. Now, instead of single keys, HSM’s would create and store key shards, which means those shards would never come together to create a key outside the HSM.”  This development is relevant to Metaco clients, who generally want to know whether they should opt for an MPC or an HSM solution, noted Treccani. In addition, the complexity of MPC leads many users toward the “absolute disaster” scenario, where all the key shards are stored in the same data center, he added.  “Our clients are large banks and custodians and want to have full control over the key material. This makes MPC very complex for them to use, because it means they have to deploy different key shards in completely separate data centers,” Treccani said. “In practice, we know the market is going to converge on the best of both worlds; it’s about having the decentralization of MPC, and having the minimal attack surface of HSMs.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/07/crypto-custody-tech-firm-metaco-taps-ibm-to-revamp-institutional-push,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc70e816e10b2cb45600f040fae50a5d99c2f4e3-1920x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Grayscale operates the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has $10 billion-plus in assets under management and was late last year trading at a record discount to net asset value, although that discount has fluctuated recently. Grayscale, Genesis and CoinDesk share the same parent company in DCG.  On Jan. 20 this year, Genesis Global Holdco LLC, the holding company of cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York after being hit by the crypto contagion of 2022, which was exacerbated by the implosions of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto exchange FTX.  On Monday, CoinDesk reported that DCG and Genesis reached an agreement with a key group of creditors intending to sell its subsidiary Genesis' crypto trading business as well as its lending arm, which is restructuring through bankruptcy.  According to the FT report citing filings, DCG's recent share sales have focused on the Ethereum fund, where the group has moved to sell about a quarter of its stock to raise as much as $22 million in several trades since Jan. 24. The company is selling at about $8 per share, despite each share's claim to $16 of ether.  ""This is simply part of our ongoing portfolio rebalancing,"" DCG told CoinDesk.  Grayscale did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  A Bernstein report had earlier said saving Grayscale would come at a cost for DCG.

""The Boba Foundation is granted an additional use grant to use the Uniswap v3 Core software code,"" the proposal stated. ""As part of this additional use grant, the Boba Foundation receives license to use the Uniswap Code to fully deploy the Uniswap Protocol v3 onto the Boba Network [layer 2] on the Ethereum blockchain.""

The service resumption comes three weeks after Juno began working with its new crypto custodian Zero Hash. Juno was forced to pause its services in early January as its former crypto custodian Wyre buckled under the weight of the market downturn.  Juno CEO and co-founder Varun Deshpande said in a press release the new partnership will offer users a more secure experience on the platform.  ""Given the events of 2022, we are committed to building a secure and compliant on and off-ramp product for the long term growth of the industry,” Deshpande said.  In addition to resuming its crypto services, the bank has also debuted several new features. Those include support for more than 35 additional cryptocurrencies such as SOL, ADA, SHIB snd DOGE, and the reduction of spreads on new and existing token offerings. The platform now also offers a zero-trading-fee incentive and a rewards program for every dollar traded in nonstablecoin tokens.  Although Juno has resumed most services, the platform's team is still working to restore crypto paycheck services and layer 2 withdrawals and deposits.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: What's next for crypto prices? Traders are waiting for a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before they make their next moves. In Japan, one digital assets company wants to build the market for NFT trading in yen.  Insights: Digital asset financial services firm SBI is building a MetaMask competitor for yen-denominated NFT trading. Could the initiative aid Japan's Web 3 efforts?

Singapore-based crypto trading fund QCP Capital said in a recent note that the performance of equities today and U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell’s speech will be its guide to the next leg in crypto.  “Without a recession and >4% unemployment this year, it is extremely unlikely the Fed will cut rates, which means our view that the market’s pricing of cuts this year is too dovish still holds,” the fund wrote.  QCP said its is looking to hear Powell's comments on whether he thinks the current market rally has “gotten out of hand.”  Despite talk of a recession, and frequent headlines mentioning layoffs, the last two job markets reports show that the U.S. labor market is still hot. December’s numbers show the U.S. added 223,000 jobs to payrolls, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.5%, while recently released numbers from January show 517,000 jobs being added. Both numbers defied expectations.  “I think it's still going to be very hard to get to 2%,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst with Oanda, recently said on CoinDesk TV. “The Fed acknowledged, for the first time in this cycle, they said that the disinflation process has begun.”  Moya highlighted the strong labor market in the U.S. and worldwide as an obstacle to driving down inflation with increased wages supported by a fundamentally strong market.  “If we see further signs that some inflation abroad is becoming stickier than we thought, then there’s a risk of a decent sell-off across Wall Street that could drag down bitcoin,” he said.  Moya says he’s looking at Treasury yields. There’s still a correlation between that and the price of bitcoin that remains intact – for now.

Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Cardano ADA −4.3% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA −4.2% Entertainment Solana SOL −4.0% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  SBI's Metamask Competitor for Yen-Denominated NFT Trading  Japan’s SBI, a digital assets financial services firm, recently announced it's launching a MetaMask-like wallet platform for non-fungible tokens (NFT) that’s only using the Japanese yen for trades on the SBINFT Market, CoinDesk Japan reports.  Japan, with its world-renowned IP and universally recognized styles of art, is an emerging hub for NFTs. But the majority of transactions are done in U.S. dollars, not yen, which is something that SBI is looking to change.  In international trade dominated by fiat, the U.S. dollar, the world’s most liquid currency and the measure for most commodities’ pricing, ranks as the highest-traded global currency, with nearly 88% of global trade denominated in greenbacks. This is predictable, as the U.S. is the world’s largest economy and most of the globe’s trade has some sort of nexus to the country.  Crypto, however, is tied to no nation. There’s no centralized economy behind it. Yet, at the same time the majority of the world’s digital asset transactions are denominated in USD.  “Despite the shrinking U.S. portion of the world’s GDP, the dollar increasingly dominates, notably in the digital ecosystem,” Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone wrote in an April 2021 note. “There appears to be little to stop the most consistent trends in crypto assets: rising trading volume and the proliferation of stablecoins tracking the dollar.”  Case in point: Data from CoinGecko shows that there’s only around $87 million in 24-hour volume for yen-denominated bitcoin trading pairs, and roughly $21.5 million for ether trading in yen. There have been a few attempts at developing a yen stablecoin, but they don’t seem to have gotten much traction.  But this comes as Japan fully embraces Web 3. As CoinDesk’s Emily Parker reported during a recent trip to the country, crypto there seems to exist in a near parallel universe. Post-Mt. Gox rules have meant that FTX Japan assets are held in third-party custody; lawmakers are working to propose a framework for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and NFTs to the Diet, the nation’s legislature.  The next step of this embrace will be more crypto trading in yen. SBI’s Web 3 wallet might be what instigates things.

The spike reflects the platform’s significant ecosystem growth in 2022, particularly during the fourth quarter.  The token began to climb at the beginning of 2023 after plummeting in the second half of 2022, and is now trading at around 13 cents, up 55% over the last seven days. GRT had risen above $5 billion in market value before spiraling as the wider crypto market started tumbling in late 2021.  The Graph removes the need for data consumers like app developers to expand complex infrastructure for gathering on-chain data. It currently supports indexing data from 26 different blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Near, Arbitrium, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Celo, Fantom, Moonbeam and IPFS.  The two main sources of revenue for the project are inflationary indexing rewards and query fees paid by data consumers, according to a Messari February report on the protocol.  Data from the report showed that in the fourth quarter of 2022, The Graph witnessed a 66% quarter-over-quarter increase in GRT revenue from query fees (In USD terms this amounts to a 5% QoQ increase and a 265% year-over-year rise.) The report also noted that query fees “should continue to increase as more subgraphs are migrated to mainnet in the coming quarters.”  Some analysts also attributed GRT’s rally to its link to Artificial Intelligence (AI) related tokens, which have been surging recently due to the ChatGPT effect. CoinMarketCap’s rankings of the “most valuable AI and big data crypto projects and tokens” currently has The Graph as the leading platform in market capitalization. According to Pablo Jodar, a crypto analyst at GenTwo, “I think it is linked to the rally on AI stocks, due to the ChatGPT effect.”  The platform raised $50 million in a funding round that was led by Tiger Global Management in January 2022.",POSITIVE,GRT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | GRT,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/07/indexing-protocol-the-graphs-grt-token-soars-back-past-1b-market-cap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e976efde4cfb952c3d537970a68d8325aceda488-3160x2370.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
