42398977,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpfe,1460148931,Crypto Exchange Service ShapeShift Offline After Hack,"Digital currency exchange service ShapeShift is offline after a security incident earlier this week.  A statement posted to Reddit by ShapeShift CEO Eric Voorhees offered more details as to why the site was taken offline, indicating an unknown quantity of funds had been taken from the service’s connected wallets. Customers with pending orders would receive their money within 24 hours, the company said.  Voorhees wrote:  ""Yesterday afternoon, we noticed several pieces of evidence indicating our server infrastructure was compromised and threatened. We made the decision to scrap that infrastructure, and rebuild in a wholly new and safe environment. This is what we are currently engaged in. While we hate having the service offline, it was the safer path.""  Voorhees did not give a timeline for when the service, which offers instant cryptocurrency exchange for a variety of cryptocurrencies, would be back online. A notice posted to the main ShapeShift website indicates that the service will be offline for at least several days.  Prior to announcing the hack, ShapeShift had taken to Twitter to state that it had taken its website offline, citing maintenance.

42398988,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhprS,1460146411,Bitcoin Bores Traders as Volume Declines on Price Stability,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.  Bitcoin spent most of the seven days ending 8th April fluctuating between $415 and $425 amid modest trading volume.  These developments largely mirrored the previous week, with the exception of the fact bitcoin experienced weaker trading volume compared to the last several weeks.  Some market experts sought to explain bitcoin’s relative price stability by asserting that low volatility has sapped the interest of many traders. George Samman, a blockchain advisor and consultant, told CoinDesk that bitcoin's volatility has fallen to its lowest since 2012, and that as a result, ""volume has dried up"" and lies far below both its 52-day and 52-week moving average.  ""I still believe it’s the calm before the storm,"" he stated, adding that this is ""pretty much a no trade zone.""  Zane Tackett, director of community and product development at Bitfinex, struck a similar tone by telling CoinDesk that ""there's a lot of watching and waiting"", and that as a result, ""things are pretty calm.""  He spoke to the major challenges facing bitcoin, stating that people are mostly ""wondering how scaling will pan out"" and ""whether or not the SegWit soft-fork is deployed smoothly and on time"".  Others pointed to seasonal factors. For example, many traders have been on holiday because of Easter in the West and the Qing Ming holiday in China, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, told CoinDesk.  Price movements  During the seven-day period through 8th April at 12:00 UTC, the price bitcoin climbed from $415.42 to $421.07, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.  This represents a modest increase of 1.4%. The digital currency did experience some notable fluctuations during the week, surging from $415.73 at 21:00 UTC on 1st April to $420.25 at 01:00 UTC on 8th April.  But, bitcoin then traded largely between $417.50 and $420 until 02:00 UTC on 5th April, before fluctuating between $420 and $422.50 for the rest of the week.  The digital currency stayed within this tight range as market participants traded more than 8m BTC during the seven days through 8th April at 17:00 UTC. This figure was a pretty far shot from the robust transaction volume of 32m BTC that exchanges logged during the prior week.  Ether still volatile  While bitcoin had a mild week in terms of price movements and trading volume, ether, the native cryptocurrency on the public, Ethereum blockchain experienced sharp fluctuations, falling 14.3% from 0.028 BTC to 0.024 BTC during the seven days through 8th April at 12:00 UTC.  This sharp decline took place when many are trading alternatives to bitcoin due to their volatility, said Hayes. Amid this renewed interest, ether generated 24-hour trading volume of 19,856 BTC during the start of the week and 19,898 BTC at the end.  Christopher Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, shed some light on ether's future price movements by reviewing the technicals.  ""Ether broke through triple bottom support that it had developed since March 20th, around .0235 bitcoin/ether,"" he stated, citing Poloniex data. ""If it doesn’t reverse the downward trend it may retrace all the way back to .020, where it experienced high volume on March 18th, which led to a strong price bounce at the time.""  Bitcoin's rising legitimacy  While bitcoin's relative price stability has been helping generate visibility for ether, several market experts asserted that this lack of volatility could help bitcoin garner greater legitimacy.  ""Up to a year ago, the volatility of bitcoin was a huge topic,"" Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, told CoinDesk. He added that, ""If you take a step back and look at bitcoin from a lifecycle standpoint, the currency is experiencing record-setting stability.""  Enneking said:  ""If you look back at certain of the criticisms which some have levied against bitcoin as a currency, one was that it was too unstable.""  If that argument carries water, “bitcoin is coming closer to being considered a legitimate currency,"" he said.  While Enneking spoke to how greater stability may be making bitcoin more valid, another expert asserted that its lack of volatility is helping show the digital currency’s fair price.  ""Continued price stability shows that bitcoin is priced at fair value despite lower levels of speculative trading,"" Joe Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""A reduction in price volatility will allow for growth in Bitcoin’s utilitarian use cases to shine.

42398986,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpqT,1460141417,Libertarian Party of Texas to Store Election Results On Three Blockchains,"The Libertarian Party of Texas will today log the results of a wide range of ballot initiatives on three separate blockchains, the most recent in a line of projects integrating the technology into the voting process.  Results of everything from ballot initiatives proposed on the spot to the selection of the state’s US presidential electors will be logged on the blockchains in what a party leader says is a step toward politicians being held accountable to voters in a new way.  John Wilford, treasurer of the Libertarian Party of Texas, told CoinDesk:  ""The idea is that after the balloting is collected, the records will be uploaded to the blockchain for future generations and accountability.""  At the two-day event, which kicks off today in San Antonio, Texas, votes by 250 delegates and 100 alternatives on all of the state’s nominations will be logged on a private blockchain created by Libertarian Party partner Blockchain Technologies Corporation (BTC), as well as the Florincoin blockchain. The final tally will also be logged in the bitcoin blockchain.  ""Every ballot is going to be logged in Florincoin,"" said Nick Spanos, founder of BTC. ""We also hash all that out and put it on the bitcoin blockchain. But on the Florincoin, you can read every single ballot.""  Spanos said he was attracted to Florincoin for the project because of its metadata limit of 528 bytes, compared to bitcoin’s 80 bytes. The extra space makes it perfect for storing ballot information, he said.  Joseph Fiscella, who joined Florincoin after its June 2013 debut, told CoinDesk:  ""Florincoin was purposely created for data storage so developers will always support the data, while other blockchains were made for value exchanges.""  On the convention floor  To make the idea of using a blockchain less daunting to the convention attendees, paper ballots will be used to actually mark the votes. Each ballot will then be digitally uploaded using two scanners with a third back-up using BTC’s patent-pending technology.  Published in January of this year, the patent application for the voting machine describes how the device uses private keys to digitally sign voting data and broadcast the results along with a public key to the distributed network. The signed voting data is then stored with its public key on a blockchain database managed by the voting machines.  Decided at the three-day conference will be Texas’s Libertarian officers including chairman, vice-chairman, secretary, and treasurer. Delegates to the national convention, and presidential electors who will help determine the national party’s presidential nominee, will also be voted on.  The national candidate will be formally selected at the Libertarian party national convention in Orlando, Florida, which runs from 27th May to 30th May.  Concern over voter fraud  While the Libertarian party’s ballots are still on paper, BTC’s Spanos, who is also the co-founder of the Bitcoin Center in New York City, said an indelible method for logging the votes on a blockchain has the potential to change voter perceptions about the frequency of voter fraud.  ""In an election everybody has to feel confident. Especially the losing candidates,"" said Spanos. ""This is a way to make sure that happens.""  While the actual frequency of voter fraud is still a hotly contested issue, the perception of voter fraud is very real. In 2012, Loyola law professor Justin Levitt, who is currently on leave to work at the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, estimated that over the previous twelve years, the fraud rate was 0.000002%.  That percentage came from nine instances of specific allegations of voter fraud during a time when approximately 400 million people voted. But according to a 2014 study by Marquette University, 39 percent of voters from a Wisconsin state-wide poll believed that voter fraud affected “a few thousand votes"" each election.  Putting on the pressure  To help battle that perception, a batch of blockchain applications to voter technology have cropped up around the world. California-based BitCongress uses blockchain tech for voting, legislating and budgeting. In Virginia, Follow My Vote takes BTC’s process a step further by integrating what it describes as cryptographically secure ID verification to a online voting process.  Overseas, Danish political party, Liberal Alliance, and Australia’s newly formed Flux Party have both already expressed interest in using blockchain-based voting systems.  Back in Texas, the first day of the three-day convention is scheduled to end this evening with a sold-out Presidential Debate between five invited candidates: New Mexico Governor, Gary Johnson, anesthesiologist, Marc Feldman, McAfee Security founder John McAfee, Libertarian academic Austin Petersen, and pastor Shawna Sterling.  In true free-market fashion the party invited its US Presidential candidate speakers based on a straw-poll that literally let people vote with their dollars. Johnson won the straw-poll with $2,276.07 worth of votes cast compared to Sterling, who won the final position with $703.49 worth of votes.  While Spanos and his team will be studying the process of logging votes on the three blockchains to keep an eye out for ways to increase user trust in the technology, the treasurer of the Libertarian Party of Texas said he is watching for something else.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Wilford said he hopes the demonstration inspires attendees to put pressure on party leaders at the national level to take similar steps.  Wilford said:  ""We’re supportive of any free market technology of which bitcoin definitely counts. It’s the next step of a long process.""

42398981,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpkZ,1460136451,Japan's Financial Regulator to Discuss Blockchain Market Applications,"Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is set to hold a meeting early next month at which representatives of the regulatory body will take part in a policy discussion on blockchain applications in the country’s financial markets.  In an 8th April notice, the government entity overseeing banking, insurance and securities and exchange, said that it plans to weigh the effects of automated, high-frequency trading operations on market stability and transparency, as well as examine new developments in the asset management industry.  A date for which has not yet been disclosed by the FSA.  The agency stated:  ""The development of FinTech such as block-chain technology is now a rapidly emerging, important topic for market participants to address intentionally. Discussion also needs to be held on what kind of solutions we should prepare in order to enhance the competitiveness of our markets.”  The remarks come weeks after an official from the FSA voiced support for Asia to become a global leader in blockchain applications. At the time, vice minister for international affairs Masamichi Kono advocated for a risk-oriented approach to encouraging adoption of disruptive technologies like blockchain.  The FSA is no stranger to digital currency issues, having drawn up a proposal for regulating exchange services in the wake of the collapse of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  The agency is also playing a role in defining the legal status of digital currencies in Japan.

In a blog post today, Storj revealed the news while providing an overview of how it creates a decentralized market for unused disk space, enabling it to be bought and sold for its native cryptocurrency SJCX.  The announcement follows the March news that Microsoft had added Augur, BitShares, Lisk and Syscoin to its development testbed.  Microsoft has previously indicated that it does not intend to limit the number of blockchain providers accepted into the testing version of its BaaS service.  A more formal certified offering would likely be released this spring, at which time technology providers involved are expected to pass a more stringent review, the company has said.  Founded in 2014, Storj raised some $500,000 worth of bitcoin in a public crowdsale that year.

42398974,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpdg,1460123983,BNP Sees 3 Reasons Why Crowdfunding Could Benefit from Blockchain,"BNP Paribas is choosing to begin its public experiments with blockchain tech by pursuing one of its less discussed use cases – crowdfunding.  The French financial services giant intends to launch a private securities program built using blockchain tech. The effort, a partnership with SmartAngels, a firm that allows entrepreneurs to raise money from private and professional investors, even has ambitious attempts to go live by the second half of 2016.  In interview, BNP Paribas product manager Johann Palychata said that crowdfunding was selected as one of the company’s first use cases due to its ability to impact the market more immediately than other alternatives.  Palychata told CoinDesk:  ""With small volumes, yet quite complex processes, we saw an opportunity to work on blockchain technology for crowdfunding.""  Palychata said that BNP believes blockchain tech could address three big challenges in crowdfunding by creating standardization; making it easier to manage and register crowdfunded shares; and increasing transparency and reliability in the market.  ""I would say the first thing [blockchain helps] is standardization of the securities registration, that is very important for crowdfunding,"" he said.  Palychata further noted that the blockchain would add transparency and accountability to the market, features that wouldn’t be reduced as the number of participants using the platform increased with demand.  The formal announcement follows internal hackathons and explorations by BNP. Palychata described the firm’s approach to blockchain as being in ""project mode"", a phase that finds the firm putting an emphasis on prototyping various blockchain applications.  ""We’ve engaged with many different counterparties and what you see here with this announcement is we’re clearly going into crowdfunding,"" he said.  Still in testing  While Palychata did not say which specific technologies BNP and SmartAngels are using to build the platform, he said that tokens on the blockchain will be used to represent ownership.  ""The main function is registering securities on the blockchain,"" he said, adding that startup operators would then be able to distribute them to their investors.  Palychata said that BNP conducted a test of its technology on an internal blockchain, and that it would perhaps soon announce steps to introduce other partners to this ecosystem.  He noted that the project will need a functioning order book, investors and startups using the platform for it to be truly tested.  Still, Palychata did not indicate what the timeline for such work would be.  ""It’s too early for me to announce other things,"" he added.  Secondary market  When asked about the ramifications the project could have at scale, Palychata was quick to focus on the steps ahead for the pilot, preferring not to speculate on its impact.  To start, he said, the project could be considered a success by simply becoming a platform for securities that aren’t currently listed by major exchanges.  ""We see a huge benefit for the market to have such a platform in place,"" he said. ""Obviously, when you have a platform on which you have many issuers and investors, you have the development of a secondary market. But that’s not the first goal we’ll reach.""  As for whether startups and small businesses will continue to leverage crowdfunding, and whether they’ll look for the efficiencies of a blockchain platform, Palychata was similarly focused on the work ahead.  He concluded:  ""Blockchain might enable a secondary market. We’ll see.""

42398992,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpvO,1460076314,Bitcoin Exchange itBit to End Services in Texas,"Texas, long considered one of the friendliest states in the US to bitcoin, now has one less industry startup operating within its borders.  In a phone conversation with CoinDesk, a representative of bitcoin exchange itBit said it would no longer be doing business in the state.  Spokesman Kyle Arteaga told CoinDesk:  ""I can confirm that itBit is no longer supporting Texas residents at this time.""  Affected customers have until 14th April to withdraw their funds.  That leaves itBit open for business in the other 49 states. In May 2015, itBit announced it had been granted status as a limited purpose trust company by the state of New York, letting it operate much like a bank in all fifty states. While it was allowed to hold funds for its customers, it was not allowed to make loans or take deposits.  In an email to CoinDesk, Texas-based itBit customer Andre Fontenot forwarded an email from the company with instructions for how to withdrawal his funds. Another customer later took to social media with information about an email detailing the Texas pull-back.  The email read:  ""We regret to inform you that starting today, itBit will no longer be supporting Texas residents. Your existing account may not be used to trade on our exchange or OTC trading desk.""  In interview, Fontenot sounded surprised by the news that itBit was ending its services in the Lone Star State.  “I just got through reading something about how Texas was going to be the next bitcoin capital,” he said.  Indeed, since April 2014 when the Texas Department of Banking released a memo outlining its regulatory position on digital currencies, the state has been widely viewed as one of the friendliest in the US to bitcoin businesses.  In the email to customers, itBit suggested that it may reopen to Texas customers at some point in the future.  ""Thank you for being an itBit customer. We will contact you if our status in Texas changes in the future,"" it read.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in itBit.
