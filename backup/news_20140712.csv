42425881,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglVh,1405167317,Under the Microscope: The True Costs of Banking,"It is very hard to quantify the global impact of the banking and finance system, however, there are some key figures that we can draw on for an order-of-magnitude estimate.  The World Bank publishes several world development indicators, of which one is financial access. The table below shows their data and associated estimate calculations (World Bank, 2014), based on a world adult population of 5.325 billion people (Indexmundi, 2013).  A model developed by the CoolClimate Network at one of the world’s leading and most respected universities, the University of California, Berkeley (CoolClimate Network, 2014), assesses the carbon footprint of businesses based on business sector, the number of locations, employees, annual revenue, and square feet of facilities.  This allows us to estimate the carbon footprint of the world banking and finance industry within an order of magnitude. Inputs into the model are calculated below.  Bank branches  Model inputs  Number of employees  While it is difficult to quantify the number of people employed by the world’s banking and finance industry, using the Pareto principle (80-20 rule), the world’s largest 20% of banks most likely employ 80% of all banking employees. Employee statistics for the world’s largest 30 banks are shown in the table below.

Annual revenue  An analysis undertaken by McKinsey & Company in 2012 shows global banking revenue of $3.4tn (McKinsey & Company, 2012).  Square foot area of facilities  From personal experience designing offices in Australia, a good rule of thumb is about 100 square feet per employee (10 square metres) to satisfy access and egress requirements in commercial building codes.  An area of 50-150 ft2 is recommended by the online US resource Engineering Toolbox (Engineering Toolbox, 2013). Using a value of 100 ft2 leads to a total area of about 60 million ft2 for the world’s 600,000 bank branches.  Model output and sensitivity analysis  Plugging the above inputs into the UCB model yields a result of 383.1 million tonnes of CO2 per year. A sensitivity analysis using four other scenarios shows little difference in overall footprint. Because the data on revenue is accurate, that variable remains fixed in all scenarios.  As can be seen from Table 17, the governing factor of the model appears to be the amount of yearly revenue generated, as significant changes to number of employees and branches have little effect on the model output.  Sense check  The World Resource Institute categorises world greenhouse gas emissions by end-use and activity (World Resources Institute, 2009).  In its 2009 report, it was identified that commercial buildings account for 6.3% of world emissions, and the mining of non-ferrous metals (including gold) and aluminium account for 1.3% – an impact ratio of commercial buildings to mining of 4.86.  Considering that only a relatively small amount of gold is mined every year (a few thousand tonnes), it is assumed that banks account for larger proportion of all commercial buildings, as gold mining does for non-ferrous metal mining.  This would mean that banks should have an impact of between six to eight times greater than that of gold. Having calculated a value of 54 million tonnes of CO2 produced by the gold mining industry, this would put the impact of the banking industry between 324 and 432 million tonnes of CO2, which is well within the same ballpark as the value of 380 million tonnes calculated by the UCB model.  ATMs  While ATMs reduce the need for bank branches, these machines have their own carbon footprint which isn’t insignificant.  It is estimated that each of the world’s 2,394,700 ATMs has an energy usage of 0.25 kWh (Roth, et al., 2002). This translates to a yearly energy use of 18.9 million GJ, or 3.2 million tonnes of CO2.  Summary  The environmental impact of the world’s financial access points are summarised in the table below  Using the rate of $100/MWh, the above energy use would equate to an annual energy bill of $63.8bn, or, roughly 2% of total revenue.  At 0.75 million tonnes of CO2 produced per year, Bitcoin has 99.8% fewer emissions than the banking system.

42425871,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglBh,1405163448,"MaidSafe CEO David Irvine Talks Nature, Ants and Decentralization","Eight years ago, David Irvine launched a company with modest ambitions: to decentralize the Internet.  MaidSafe  aims to offer an alternative to the widespread use of servers: a decentralized data network on which decentralized applications can be built.  The Scotland-based platform held a successful crowdsale to raise funding earlier this year, netting $6m in under six hours. Five hundred developers, MaidSafe says, have since joined its ranks.  Decentralization is a persistent theme that has surfaced again and again in the cryptocurrency community, but Irvine has his own unique take on the phenomenon. He often describes how ants, neurons and other natural marvels guide the structure of the decentralized data platform.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Irvine dissected the features of MaidSafe's security-minded network at greater length. Working to shield the privacy, security, and safety of its users, Irvine's network behaves somewhat like an ant colony – as we shall see.  The structures behind nature  Irvine kicked off the conversation by noting that nature itself has no overarching authority: “If you look at the globe from a distance, from a logical perspective, we've actually got a planet full of decentralized systems. They all co-exist at any point in time.”  By Irvine's definition, the world as we know it is composed of relatively unintelligent pieces that squash together to produce a complicated order. He suggested that we need only to look inwards to observe this: “When you take these cells and you put several trillion of them together, all these things with minimal intelligence, they make up a human. The human is a very complex beast.”  Neurons are one example. One neuron is useless on its own, but when it collaborates with a host of others in the brain, they compose “something of remarkable intelligence”.  Thus, Irvine argued, decentralized technologies are more effective because they resemble nature. That is why, in his opinion, the copious lines of code that drive IBM Watson, the cognitive device that famously won Jeopardy, are not the future of artificial intelligence.  However, many sectors, including telecommunications, are currently centralized. Internet service providers store our personal information and data in centralized servers, out of necessity. Companies like Facebook and Google snatch up data and use it for advertising. Centralization also makes it easy for an entity, such as the NSA or GHCQ, to tap into it.  Irvine said he worries that this structure stems privacy, and consequently creativity. However, he thinks nature provides the model for the necessary fixes.  Inside the colony  Irvine pointed to ant colonies as a vivid example of decentralized orders.  These critters divide into a labor camps: soldiers, foragers, cleaners, and food carriers. Ants are constantly assessing the “personas” of the other ants with sensors in their antennae. And they can alter their persona to meet changing conditions.  One morning, an ant might amble out of the hive as a soldier ant, but after meeting a few soldier ants it might determine that that labor camp is too crowded and swap personas, taking on another role.  Organized as such, ants are capable of solving fairly complex problems, he said. For example, Deborah M. Gordon, a Stanford ecologist whom Irvine draws inspiration from, experimented by tossing droplets of dirt in the paths of the ants. A cohort of ants switched to the “cleaner” persona to deal with the debris.  Gordon even suggested in a recent TED talk that Internet network experts learn from these connected organisms.  The MaidSafe network is orchestrated like a giant ant colony. Irvine described in detail how each node, connected over a peer-to-peer network, can infer rules and actions based on the message it receives.  For example, a node may decide to store or communicate the data, assuming a persona similar to a soldier or cleaner ant, in response to the message. However, clearly, the analogy only goes so far: “MaidSafe nodes are like an ant colony, but the nodes are allowed to change their persona a million times per second.”  It is as if MaidSafe is composed of nimble, digital organisms.  'Intellectual laziness'  When asked why experts have not followed a similar model, Irvine recounted how MaidSafe flies in the face of the way computer scientists are trained. Communicating the ideas behind the decentralized project has been difficult:  “Sometimes when someone says they're an expert, I think 'Oh, good god, you must not be'.”  Ant colonies have been a more effective tool for communicating MaidSafe's decentralized structure to both the skeptical and the uninitiated.  Building the project has been “inordinately difficult”, but nature shows these systems are possible, Irvine said. Dismissing the task as too hard is “rubbish”:  ""That, to me, is where we suffer these days from 'There's an app for that' mentality or 'I read all of these newspapers, but only read headlines'. The ability to go into detail seems to be getting lost.""  Success is a matter of taking “the Edison route” and crossing off the 10,000 ways that don't work, before reaching the one that does, he added.  What would aliens think?  Irvine suggested that people thinking about the Internet should adopt the point of view of an intelligent being from another planet – who is disconnected from earth and could deliver a fairer judgment.  The alien might perceive the prevailing benefits: the borderless flow of the Internet and the network's ability to “seek some of the intelligence out of their brains,” Irvine said. But, uninhibited and unbiased, an external intelligent being would pick up on the malicious aspects. It might ponder:  “What are these third parties in the middle? What's this Google thing or this Yahoo thing? Some of these people are actually being prevented from looking at some of this information. Then it doesn't look like a move forward. This is not evolution because these people are losing the ability to be creative.”  After discovering these flaws, “this intelligent being from outer space would probably just be very depressed”, he added.  When considering the world from afar, with nature, neurons and ants all considered, for Irvine, decentralization forms a point of view and also a catalyst for change.

42425873,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglJh,1405159535,Swedish Parliamentary Candidate to Raise Bitcoin-Only Campaign Funds,"Sweden’s general election is set to take place on 14th September, and one of the country’s parliamentary candidates announced this week what could be a world first in campaign financing.  Mathias Sundin is a former Member of Parliament and the deputy mayor of the Swedish city Norrköping. He’s running again this year for a seat in Parliament to represent the county of Östergötland. And as of 10th July his campaign accepts donations exclusively in bitcoin.  Speaking with CoinDesk, he said:  “Bitcoin – and other digital currencies – is a fantastic innovation. By accepting only bitcoin in my campaign … I want to spread the knowledge and also hope some new people will try it.”  Sundin didn’t disclose any numbers, but said that he immediately received about 30 donations on the day of the announcement.  Politics is becoming more global, he said, implying that elected officials everywhere need to make sure regulation to keeps up with innovation:  “In a couple of years three or four billion people will have a smart phone and all be connected with each other. From this there will be a lot of disruptive innovation that will be good for humanity. Strong forces will be challenged and they will come out fighting, so then we have to have politicians that see what is going on embrace the change in the world.”  He added: “I really don't want any regulators coming and destroying or slowing down this development [of bitcoin innovation].”  Campaign financing  Sundin said he is confident that the weight of his party, the Liberal People’s Party (Folkpartiet), along with his existing financing will carry him through the election no matter how successful his fundraising efforts turn out.  He said:  “Even if I don't get that many donations I will stick with bitcoin through this campaign, and I hope and I think that the bitcoin community will help me out. Even if the donations don't stack up that high I will be able to run my campaign.”  That being so, for him it’s as much a bitcoin advocacy effort as it is campaign financing. Due to a lack of education and awareness of bitcoin, he said, too many readily accept the negative headlines they read. To that point, ill-informed theories and speculation about the digital currency tend to overshadow its real potential.  “The platform could be even more important than the currency,” he said.  While Sundin follows other political candidates in accepting bitcoin for campaign contributions, he won’t accept dollars, euros or even Swedish kronas. He could be the first to refuse donations in legal, fiat currency. Yesterday a United States Congressional candidate announced his campaign would also be raising bitcoin-only funds.  But the world population is looking increasingly like a small, global community, he suggested:  “It's a campaign in my county but the funding is worldwide. That says something about the world that we’re living in and even more about the future.”  Bitcoin is acceptable in Swedish political campaign fundraising to the point of 4.7 BTC, Sundin said.  Who is Mathias Sundin?  When asked what matters to him as a candidate, Sundin told CoinDesk his top priorities are continuing education reforms in Sweden, developing the country’s tax system, working to protect the people’s right to privacy and improving bitcoin education and awareness.  He called bitcoin his biggest priority.  And with the global community chatter about how attractive it could be for drug dealers, money launderers and agents of other illicit activity, Sundin is poised to neutralize such fears.  On privacy laws, he said: “It’s very important to protect everyone’s right to privacy and to balance our right to privacy with fighting crimes from terrorists.”  He added:  “But my privacy concern with bitcoin is that all transactions are public. That is of course an important part of bitcoin, but governments might be able to use this as part of their surveillance. Therefore I don't think bitcoin will be very popular for criminal activity and terrorism.”  Scandinavian leadership  One argument has been made repeatedly that bitcoin as a digital currency has a greater use case in developing and emerging economies than in countries with effectively stable financial systems; places that would more readily accept the change that comes with financial and technological innovation, with weak and fluctuating currencies, largely unbanked populations and rooted with political corruption.  By contrast, consumers in stable economies in North America and Europe can sooner enjoy new bitcoin innovation, products and services thanks to their stronger currencies, better access to financial services and electricity infrastructure. He said:  “Sweden has a pretty strong economy – a pretty good way compared to other Western countries. Our welfare and our human rights are not a given.”  In the Scandinavian region alone, the first bitcoin ATM in Europe came out of Finland; auroracoin emerged out of Iceland as a national cryptocurrency distributed to the entire population; Safello, who by now have established themselves as the leading European bitcoin exchange, are based in Sweden.  But for the same reasons that innovation advances more quickly in Western markets, financial regulators in these regions are reluctant to accept bitcoin as a currency in what may already be well-functioning environments, a concern Sundin reiterated.  He said he wants to help bring Sweden to the forefront of the bitcoin industry. The bitcoin debate isn’t a mainstream discussion in Sweden, he explained; few lawmakers have even thought about bitcoin. Swedes are often quick at adapting new technologies and have a “pretty strong startup community, especially around Stockholm”.  Sunden also hinted at bitcoin’s role in Sweden’s economy, mentioning the prospects for creating many and high-paying jobs.  Emerging economies don’t enjoy the same wealth, he added:  “Bitcoin is a real chance for the emerging economies to catch up, but at the same time we see that the investment in bitcoin companies is in the US. We [Sweden] have a well-built startup infrastructure, but we also have strong interest that will put pressure on lawmakers to slow down bitcoin. That might not be the case in all the emerging economies.”  Swedish Parliament photo via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/12/swedish-parliamentary-candidate-to-raise-bitcoin-only-campaign-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b260f9c93e00cfdc50e21340ea943b532862029-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425875,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglHh,1405124417,Congressional Candidate to Fund Campaign Entirely With Bitcoin,"Dan Elder, a US House candidate in the 1st Congressional District of Missouri, has announced that he will fund his election campaign solely on bitcoin donations.  Starting on 11th July, Elder’s campaign website will only accept bitcoin donations. The candidate hopes to draw attention to digital currency during both his campaign and, if elected, his time in office.  A decision by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) allows in-kind donations in bitcoin, with a limit of $100. The May decision, prompted by questions from political action committees, opened the doors for campaigns to accept bitcoin from constituents and supporters.  Elder told CoinDesk that digital currency offers a unique way to bring soundness back to the idea of money. The Air National Guard veteran and IT specialist sees bitcoin as a competitive force against fiat currencies, traditional central banking and a risky financial sector.  He explained:  “I'm accepting BTC donations to solely fund my campaign to take a stance against the Federal Reserve and its policies which have weakened the US dollar.”  First bitcoin-only candidate in United States  Elder’s campaign effort is significant as he is the first candidate in the United States to accept only digital currency.  He first learned about bitcoin several years ago. Elder cited a career-long involvement with technology and participation in the right-leaning Liberty Movement, the latter of which being a source of broad support for digital currency.  “I want to stand before Congress, sponsor and support competing currency legislation, and remove any legal confusion for US citizens wishing to use bitcoin. The IRS still sees bitcoin as property, not currency, and the FEC hasn't decided how to treat bitcoin in regards to political campaigns. I want to deal with issues like these to make bitcoin a true competitor of the US dollar.”  Other politicians, including US Congressman Jared Polis, have already tapped bitcoin for its fundraising potential. Representative Steve Stockman of Texas began accepting bitcoin earlier this year, and later filed a digital currency bill in Congress.  Candidate aims for greater awareness  Despite a lack of concrete information about bitcoin among the broader voting population, Elder foresees success in his efforts. He remarked that the response has been enthusiastic since he first embarked on the bitcoin-only concept, saying:  “I've gotten only positive reactions and received great input from people, so I'm confident to fund the campaign at least as well as if I had relied solely on US dollar donations.”  Ultimately, Elder’s intention is to “bring more public attention to this new, open, less-regulated currency” that he says should function on an international scale like the US dollar and other fiat currencies.  Elder added that even if he isn’t successful in his bid for seat in the 1st District, he will see the campaign as a successful chance to further educate the populace about bitcoin.
