42415425,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVhMC,1654212913,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Climbs Past $30K, but Bearish Sentiment Remains","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Cryptos climbed late in the day, but not enough to dispel the prolonged bearish sentiment.  Insights: Indian crypto investors receive some upbeat news.  Technician's take: BTC continues to trade at about $30,000 as indicators remain neutral.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $30,600 +2.4%  Ether (ETH): $1,842 +0.3%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Internet Computer ICP +25.7% Computing Cardano ADA +6.2% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM +4.7% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin Climbs Late, but the Mood Remains Bearish  A late afternoon surge on Thursday carried bitcoin past $30,000, but the mood among cryptocurrency investors remained pessimistic.  The largest crypto by market capitalization was recently trading at about $30,600, a more than 2% gain over the previous 24 hours. Ether was changing hands at just above $1,800, up slightly for the same period. Most other major cryptos rose late with ADA recently rising nearly 6%, and APE up over 4%. Trading was choppy as investors continued to shy away from riskier assets – their behavior a product of inflationary and recessionary fears that have mushroomed steadily this year.  ""Bitcoin will get its groove back once bearish sentiment on Wall Street improves, but that will likely take several more weeks,"" Oanda senior markets analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email.  Stocks rose as the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.6%, the S&P 500 climbed 1.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%. Gold, a traditional safe haven in down markets, increased by more than a percentage point, underscoring the current uncertainty among investors.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied countries said that they would boost the supply of oil by an unexpectedly large amount. The U.S. and other countries had been pressing the organization to loosen its current limits to help lower energy prices. The price of Brent crude oil, which is a widely watched measure of energy markets, rose to $118 per barrel, a more than 53% spike since the start of the year.  The looming prospect of recession continued to ripple through the technology sector on Thursday with Microsoft (MSFT) ratcheting back its earnings and sales projections for the current quarter. Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), among others, reported weak first-quarter financial results last month, noting the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and unsettling macroeconomic conditions.  The crypto industry has also felt the impact of the current, dour economic mood with crypto exchange Coinbase announcing in a blog post by Chief People Officer L.J. Brock, that it would ""extend our hiring pause for both new and backfill roles for the foreseeable future and rescind a number of accepted offers."" The move came a just hours after crypto exchange and custodian Gemini, the brainchild of billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, said it would lay off 10% of its workforce, about 100 employees.  The crypto industry is in a “contraction phase that is settling into a period of stasis,” also known as a “crypto winter,” the twins wrote in a blog post.  Oanda's Moya noted that investors' ""risk appetite"" will depend on ""expectations"" of what the U.S. central bank ""will do beyond the summer.""  ""Bitcoin is forming a base but most traders are still licking their wounds,"" he wrote. ""If bitcoin can recapture the $33,500 level, that is what is needed for technical buying to get triggered.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,176 +1.8%  DJIA: 33,248 +1.3%  Nasdaq: 12,316 +2.6%  Gold: $1,868 +1.2%  Insights  Upbeat News for Indian Crypto Investors  India's crypto investors had some upbeat news for a change with trading platform CoinSwitch Kuber's announcement on Thursday that it had launched a rupee-denominated index to provide real-time information on the performance of the eight largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  The Crypto Rupee Index (CRE8) is a first in the Indian market, which has previously had to ""rely on the international indices based on the US Dollar,"" CoinSwitch Kuber CEO and co-founder Ashish Singhal tweeted. ""But these indices do not give the true picture of the Indian market and miss the supply-demand dynamics of India’s growing investor base,"" he added.  CoinSwitch Kuber is among the country's largest crypto exchanges with a self-reported 18 million users of its app. Its investors include venture capital heavyweights Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Coinbase Ventures, Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital.  The announcement follows a difficult few months for the digital assets industry in India, despite the country's growing appetite for cryptocurrencies. In April, Indians began paying a 30% capital gains tax on crypto transactions after Parliament passed a controversial tax law. The legislation, which the industry vehemently opposed, will also require crypto investors in the country to pay a 1% tax deducted at source, as well as taxes on crypto gifts, with no ability to take deductions for losses, starting on July 1.  Trading volumes plunged on major Indian exchanges in the days after the capital gains tax went into effect with at least one analyst predicting that they would not return to pre-tax law levels. The industry was subsequently rocked by the rough launch of Coinbase's crypto trading services in the country.  CoinSwitch Kuber said that CRE8 will be refreshed over 1,400 times a day to ensure it reflects real-time market movement, and that it will track eight crypto assets that represent over 85% of the total market capitalization of the crypto market traded in Indian rupees.  Singhal noted Indian investors' demand for better crypto services and information. ""#CRE8 is a demonstration of our commitment to bring more transparency to the Indian crypto market and equip users with a simple, easy-to-understand measure of the Indian market. Indian investors and market observers no longer have to second-guess how the Indian Crypto market is behaving,"" Singhal tweeted.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Stabilizes in Tight Trading Range, Resistance at $33K  Bitcoin held initial support near $29,300, which was where an upswing in price originated over the past weekend. As of Thursday afternoon, the cryptocurrency remained in a tight intraday range, with a midpoint at $30,100. That's where the most trading volume occurred over the past two weeks. For now, BTC's price could continue to revert to that midpoint level until a decisive breakout or breakdown is confirmed.  Upside appears to be limited at between the $33,000-$35,000 resistance zone, especially as momentum signals remain negative on long-term charts.  Still, momentum remains positive on the daily chart, which could keep short-term buyers active. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) will need to return above the 50 neutral mark to sustain a recovery bounce in price.

That is when the profitability of mining the cryptocurrency was still high. Due to a high cash flow, these miners could afford to hold on to a good portion of their rewards while being able to still carry out their operations. However, recent market trends have tanked the profitability of bitcoin mining, leading miners to start dipping into their BTC stash and selling to keep operations alive. Bitcoin Miners Are Selling A good number of bitcoin miners had held on to the considerable bags mostly through the bear market. With the turn of the market and bitcoin now trading below $29,000, it has become harder for miners to hold on to these coins without compromising their ability to fund their operations. The result of this has been a number of prominent bitcoin mining companies coming out to say that they have sold or will be selling some of the BTC they hold.

Can we expect the increasing bullish influence to break above $1.40? Key technical points: The GLMR market value increased by 4.64% today at press time. The price action shows a support trendline in action. The 24-hour trading volume of the Moonbeam is $27.56 Million, indicating a drop of 20%. Past Performance of GLMR GLMR prices find bullish support at the psychological support of $1 after sellers kept a high-momentum downtrend and cracked multiple support levels. The bullish support helped cushion the downfall and started a sideways trend with overhead resistance at $1.40.

42415412,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVguJ,1654206964,"Riot Blockchain Sells More Bitcoin, Trims Hashrate Guidance","Riot Blockchain (RIOT) continued to raise cash via the sale of bitcoin (BTC), unloading more than half of the bitcoin it mined in May.  One of the largest of the publicly traded bitcoin miners, Riot in May mined 466 bitcoins, about 8% fewer than April but more than double the year-ago level. The company sold 250 bitcoins in May, raising about $7.5 million, or an implied price of roughly $30,000 each.  It’s the third consecutive month of bitcoin sales for the previously confirmed hodler because the company also sold 250 bitcoins in April and 200 in March. Reflecting the near continuous decline in the price of bitcoin of late, those sales raised $10 million and $9.4 million, respectively, versus the $7.5 million raised in May.  As of the end of May, Riot still held about 6,536 bitcoin on its balance sheet.  With the bear market still in force in both traditional finance and crypto, capital markets are turning unfriendly, and Riot is hardly the only miner raising cash from the sale of its mined bitcoin.  Turning to production details, Riot said it currently has about 43,458 miners online, with a hashrate capacity of 4.6 exahash per second (EH/s), and expects to soon reach 5.4 EH/s after deploying about another 7,000 rigs..  The company trimmed its 2023 hashrate guidance to 12.6 EH/s, which assumes deployment of 116,150 mining rigs. That’s down from the previous outlook of 12.8 EH/s, and 120,150 rigs.  Riot shares are down 70% this year, in-line with peers such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Core Scientific (CORZ).

42421552,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoceL,1654204414,Trustless Evidence: Web 3 Is Helping Document War Crimes in Ukraine,"Each day millions of smartphone cameras have given us a view into the terror of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Within minutes, ordinary citizens are uploading via social media and messaging apps grim images and videos that galvanize calls for accountability of the perpetrators of apparent war crimes.  However compelling and unequivocal they appear to be, these records are not guaranteed to be admissible in court.  Jonathan Dotan will appear on the ""Big Ideas"" stage at the Consensus festival on June 10, 2022.  The journey these digital bits take from the camera lens to presentation before a judge is complex, lengthy and often fraught with risks. The tools to manipulate digital media are easy to use and as ubiquitous as the devices used to capture them.  With the erosion of trust in digital media in our era of ""fake news,"" the judicial process is not immune to the existential problems facing the internet. Our rightful mistrust of digital platforms has placed digital evidence on shaky ground. Often, we no longer believe what we see. Bad actors have weaponized our skepticism. It is a pernicious end-game of a decade-long cyberwar.  The need to reset digital trust is clear. The good news is that a viable solution is also coming into focus with the arrival of mature Web 3 technologies.  Far from the hype and controversies that pervade the crypto world, we look at the maturation of tools like blockchains and distributed ledgers as an opportunity to establish a new technical, normative and legal understanding of digital integrity.  Documentation of war crimes in Ukraine makes plain how these kind of Web 3 technologies can help establish an unalterable chain of custody by preserving provenance and privacy.  Using these open-source tools and best practices, our team at the Starling Lab has developed a framework to securely capture, store and verify digital content to meet the technical and ethical challenges of establishing trust in digital records coming out of Ukraine.  Read more: Matt Prewitt: Let’s Use New Forms of Money to Commit to Our Communities  Our new workflows seamlessly integrate L1 and L2 protocols, NFTs and secure hardware wallets to create an end-to-end and immutable Web 3 solution that can preserve digital evidence. These elements are, in essence, the new building blocks of digital authenticity. Combined, they are a powerful example of how Web 3 empowers end-users to compose solutions across new secure digital protocols.  While the underlying technology supporting it is complex, the framework is simple in its objectives:  Capture – Register and seal digital content and its metadata at the point of capture.  Store – Govern content via cryptography and preserve it on decentralized networks.  Verify – Record the attestations of experts who evaluate and audit content  Our solution has already started cryptographically authenticating and preserving thousands of records of open-source intelligence from messenger apps, social media and websites that document war crimes as well as create immutable records of fact-checkers’ analyses.  By providing an interface to this next generation of technology we hope to help the courts address challenges to admitting evidence amidst fierce cyberwar and also get ahead of emerging digital threats.  To be sure, there is much work still to be done. The courts acknowledge that they need help. The project of accountability in Ukraine requires a mix of rapid action and also patience as justice will likely wind across many venues and last decades.  Making this kind of long-term commitment to accountability requires us to face up to many challenges, but also forecast those least understood on the technical frontier. We believe that all stakeholders will rise to meet the challenge here, moving their own roadmaps faster, and helping push the courts to modernize out-of-date protocols.  This is a rare moment in which cutting-edge technologies and methods can be newly understood and safely adopted as enduring solutions for accountability in our digital age in Ukraine – and beyond.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jonathan Dotan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/02/trustless-evidence-web-3-is-helping-document-war-crimes-in-ukraine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bde04294fa03f3efdcb91f87872c07cbf026481-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411788,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzay,1654204278,Crypto Bear Market Opportunities: Make the Most of a Crypto Downturn,"The crypto markets are in a bear market. There’s no way to sugarcoat the fact that crypto markets are having a difficult year. There is, however, a silver lining unique to crypto that tax-savvy investors can use to their advantage.  The term “bear market” is defined as a market that has lost more than 20% in a given year. Bitcoin is down -35% in 2022, ether is down -43% in 2022 and many other coins are down by much more.  Read More: 4 Things to Do in a Crypto Bear Market  Assuming an investor has lost money on a crypto position, there’s a unique opportunity to take advantage of these unrealized losses. Let’s walk through a scenario.  The wash-sale loophole and tax loss harvesting  Let’s assume an investor purchased $50,000 of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in their crypto account and that the price of bitcoin was $55,000 per coin and ether was $3,500 per coin at the time of purchase. Assuming the investor split the funds evenly between bitcoin and ether at the time of purchase, he currently owns 0.45 BTC and 7.14 ETH. The investor held the coins through the bear market and still currently owns 0.45 BTC and 7.14 ETH. However, the current value of the position if bitcoin is trading at $29,000 and ether is trading at $1,900, is $26,616, an unrealized loss of $23,384.  In order to realize this loss, the investor can simply sell the crypto positions and the loss is realized. The -$23,384 loss can now be used to offset any taxable gains in other parts of the investor’s portfolio where he has profited. This is known as tax-loss harvesting.  In traditional financial markets an investor is forced to wait 30 days from the date of selling an asset in order to repurchase the same asset. If the investor does not wait 30 days, the transaction is considered a “wash sale” and the loss is not able to be used to offset a gain. So if you bought Tesla (TSLA) stock at $1,200 and sold it for $775 this year, you couldn’t rebuy Tesla stock for 30 days if you wanted to claim that loss of $425.  But this hasn’t (yet) been put into the tax code for cryptocurrency. So in the case above, if the investor still wishes to hold bitcoin and ether, he simply purchases the same amount of each immediately after selling the position. This does not create a wash sale, as it does in traditional financial securities.  Read More: 4 Things You Find in Crypto That Aren’t in Traditional Finance  The lack of a wash-sale rule in crypto is a very unique advantage to the savvy investor because crypto is incredibly volatile and its value may move significantly in 30 days. Being able to preserve a position while realizing the loss is a great way to boost long-term returns and increase tax efficiency of a financial plan.  While the market will certainly move some between a sell transaction and an immediate buy transaction, the investor in our example will be able to preserve most of his 0.45 BTC and 7.14 ETH position (minus market movement and transaction costs).  Crypto tax losses can offset more than crypto gains  Another thing to note: Losses realized in a crypto position can be used to offset tax liability on any gain realized, it does not have to be used against a crypto gain only.  It’s vital to note that taxation and crypto are a new frontier for many accountants and tax preparers. While the rules are clear, it’s incredibly important to track these transactions. If your crypto custodian does not generate a 1099 or if you self-custody your crypto, tracking your trades by hand or with the aid of crypto tax software is essential.  While we all wish crypto would simply rise in value forever, unfortunately that is not the case. Understanding the tax rules governing crypto positions can provide a unique opportunity during a bear market and can help ease taxable burdens of investors willing to do the work. While it is not guaranteed that this rule won’t change in the future, as of now this is a unique feature of crypto and should be used in financial planning.

Activity stagnates in bear market  The chart below shows a dip in the number of active entities and addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain, similar to what occurred during the 2018 crypto bear market.  There was a brief upswing in blockchain activity as investors scrambled to post margin and cover positions during the LUNA-inspired sell-off, which some analysts viewed as an early sign of capitulation. That spike in activity, however, was short-lived.  ""The recent sell-off and lower prices has not yet inspired an influx of new users to the space,"" Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  Meanwhile, existing entities on the network (possibly long-term holders) have been accumulating additional BTC on price dips, especially over the past two weeks. Still, the level of accumulation has been minor relative to previous phases.  Slower spending by bitcoin miners  Bitcoin miners have been distributing their holdings of BTC during the recent sell-off, albeit at a slower pace compared with earlier this year. Still, it is unclear if the miners' position changes will lead or react to BTC price swings.  The chart below shows the 30-day change of BTC supply held in miner addresses, according to data compiled by Glassnode.  Altcoin roundup  Solana outage: The Solana network suffered its latest outage Wednesday, felled for over four hours by a bug in how the blockchain processes a niche type of transaction that’s designed for offline use cases.

SYS crypto prices are above the middle BB with relatively high trading volumes. This is bullish and could anchor optimistic traders angling a retest of March 2022 lows of $0.44. Past Performance of Syscoin As per the development in the daily chart, Syscoin crypto is in a bull breakout formation. Syscoin prices are up 10 percent in the past 24 hours, outperforming the USDT. With high participation and a bullish breakout formation, SYS token bulls would likely add to their longs in the days ahead. Syscoin Technical Analysis The SYS token is breaking out following a squeeze, as the BB shows. After a period of sideways movement inside a tight $0.06 channel, the SYS coin is racing higher. Prices are trading above $0.23, retracing from $0.26 highs registered earlier on. The $0.26 level marks May 11 highs. Syscoin bulls may find an opportunity to load the dips at spot rates, targeting $0.26. This preview is only valid as long as prices are above the $0.17 support line. On a more cautious approach, risk-averse traders may wait for a complete reversal of May 11 losses. A close above $0.23 may propel the SYS coin towards $0.44, confirming the bulls of May 13. What to Expect from SYS? Buyers stand a chance.

CEO Akbar Shamji said Bitzero plans to build 200 megawatts of data centers in the state over the next two to three years at a cost of $400 million to $500 million. The company is also part of a joint venture focused on graphene battery technology that plans to invest $200 million to $500 million to bring an assembly and distribution hub to North Dakota over the same time frame.  “North Dakota emerged as the logical choice for Bitzero due to alignment on the state’s goal of being carbon neutral by 2030, its robust energy industry, favorable tax and regulatory environment, and access to top-tier engineering and software talent for the commercialization of new intellectual property in the data center space,” said the company in a statement.  Bitzero describes itself as a miner that “harnesses renewable energy within an ESG-driven Zero Carbon Displacement ecosystem to harmonize relationships between data processing, crypto-mining, commerce, communities, and the environment.”  Television personality and green mining advocate O’Leary is a strategic investor in Bitzero, along with Dubai-based Phoenix Group, a bitcoin mining rig supplier and venture capital firm. In the statement, O’Leary teased another announcement regarding a project in Montana that’s due to be announced this week.  To date, Bitzero has raised about $100 million in investment capital and plans to go public on the Canadian stock exchange within the next 60 days, and then subsequently aim for listing on the Nasdaq.

The &apos;exchange inflow&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin moving into wallets of all exchanges. When the value of this metric surges up, it means exchanges are receiving a high amount of coins at the moment. Such a trend can be bearish for the value of the coin as investors usually deposit their crypto to exchanges for selling purposes.

42421166,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXasN3,1654194873,"As Polygon Courts Terra Developers, It Takes Shots at Solana","Layer 2 platform Polygon is reiterating its attempts to lure Terra developers in the wake of Terra’s collapse. What’s more, the India-based company is also coming out swinging against Solana, the layer 1 blockchain that suffered yet another outage Wednesday.  Developers who are looking to continue to build within the Web 3 ecosystem following the implosion of Terra’s UST algorithmic stablecoin last month need confidence that they are going to be moving to a platform that will be around for a while, said Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt. Polygon recently made a public push to attract Terra developers with a fund, although it didn’t disclose the size of the fund.  “We felt there was an opportunity for those that wanted to build on Polygon to make sure that they knew that we were here to welcome them with open arms, [and] that we were going to help them financially get back on their feet and support their movement,” Wyatt said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program.  Wyatt – a former head of gaming partnerships at Google and head of gaming at YouTube who was hired by Polygon to lead the platform’s NFT (non-fungible token), gaming and metaverse initiatives – adds that there are a number of incremental costs that developers will need to worry about as they consider migrating from one platform to another.  Read more: Terra Devs Need a Home. Other Blockchains Are Courting Them  Polygon put together a multimillion-dollar fund via a partnership with NFT marketplace One Planet, promising to help some developers cope with the financial woes they faced after Terra’s near demise. The initiative, however, has been met with some criticism.  Wyatt took a few verbal shots at Terra’s attempted relaunch.  “We would benefit from this space no longer participating and having a platform around that has had some of those catastrophic mistakes,” Wyatt said. “I’m not a huge supporter of relaunching something just a couple of weeks later, after all the people that were hurt in this fiasco.”  Although Wyatt said he’s indifferent about what Terra 2.0 does next, he said he doesn’t necessarily see bailouts, like those issued during the banking and housing crisis of 2008-2009, as the right answer, especially if the risks were “well known and well stated.”  Taking digs at Solana  Meanwhile, as the layer 2 platform looks to continue scaling Ethereum, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal chimed in during ""First Mover"" on the recent network outages that have plagued the layer 1 Solana network. On Wednesday, Solana was down for four hours.  Read more: Solana Halted by Bug Linked to Certain Cold Storage Transactions  Nailwal, who said that he has been speaking to developers, claimed that “on a weekly basis, two or three times, they find downtime or the network is clogged,” which means that “for end users, the network is unusable.”  Nailwal added that scalability problems were bound to happen with most layer 1 platforms, saying that “Ethereum is the only proven, battle-tested layer 1 solution out there.” Polygon is a layer 2 system built atop Ethereum.  Wyatt said, “It will be very difficult for them [Solana] to capture anything outside of PFP [profile picture] NFTs if they’re going to continue to have these levels of outages and be centralized.”  Nonetheless, some players aren’t deterred. As CoinDesk reported earlier Thursday, Web 3 developer platform Alchemy is expanding its services to the Solana ecosystem.

Now prodigious crypto backer Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is offering a set of proposed solutions, publishing a report Thursday that says such groups may be better off settling in and paying U.S. taxes.  Thursday’s document builds on a push in October to lay groundwork with lawmakers on how to deal with DAOs. The previous research was about the legal challenges facing these investment groups, while the latest document is meant as a potential roadmap for the decisions each DAO should be making.  DAOs lock up funds on a blockchain that a group of participants can transparently direct toward some shared aim. In its latest public effort to establish a U.S. legal foundation for DAOs, a16z is arguing they need structures that “do not require ongoing real-world human activity” to meet legal requirements – possibly favoring unincorporated nonprofit associations (UNAs) and limited liability companies (LLCs).  The challenge is keeping a DAO decentralized while allowing it to meet the tax requirements and other practical demands of a business or nonprofit. Using well-trodden, offshore strategies to avoid taxes “could substantially increase the risk of global backlash,” according to the paper written by Miles Jennings, a16z’s general counsel and head of decentralization, and David Kerr, a lawyer from Cowrie who is involved with the DAO Research Collective  “The practical benefits of U.S. domestic structures for projects with significant U.S. membership and contacts is clear,” the paper concluded, questioning whether settling into tax-free jurisdictions while the industry waits for regulations “is really the best course of action.”  A16z certainly has a lot at stake in the matter. The firm has been involved in DAO ventures, including leading a funding round last year for Syndicate – a startup seeking to simplify the creation of DAOs – which also drew investments from actor Ashton Kutcher and rapper Snoop Dogg.  Perhaps more importantly, many of the protocols in which a16z is invested are governed by DAOs. As a large token holder, a16z could single-handedly sway many governance proposals, and it set up a team last year – the first-ever third-party professional protocol politicians – to handle its voting and delegation  UNAs, LLCs or so-called limited cooperative associations “arguably provide the greatest foundation upon which decentralized operations can be built,” according to the paper, which offered a framework for guiding investors into picking the best type of entity to set up. “This is primarily due to the significant operational and governance flexibility these structures provide.”  UPDATE (June 2, 2022, 19:27 UTC): Adds tweet from a16z's Jennings.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/02/a16z-says-us-daos-better-off-adopting-legal-structures-paying-taxes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/664970f9e4e0d9480d550ef68e77e0f10c22a5cc-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the company&apos;s massive BTC position is negative, representing approximately $70 million in unrealized losses as of this time of writing.

Customers can pay for their burritos and other Tex-Mex favorites using Flexa at any Chipotle restaurant across the U.S. The Flexa platform supports 98 digital currencies, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Solana's SOL. Customers must download the Gemini or SPEDN app, which store digital assets, to use Flexa for in-store purchases.  To celebrate its new payment options, Chipotle is giving 10% off to customers who make their next purchase with any digital currency in a Flexa-enabled app.  This isn’t Chipotle’s first move into digital currency. Last year, Chipotle announced it would give away $100,000 in free burritos and $100,000 in bitcoin to celebrate National Burrito Day. This year, Chipotle launched its own in-experience currency, Burrito Bucks, on Roblox (RBLX) to accompany the launch of its Burrito Builder game on the same platform. Players could exchange Burrito Bucks for a free entrée code at participating Chipotle restaurants.  Chipotle joins a growing list of fast-food restaurants experimenting with cryptocurrency payments and promotions. In March, Shake Shack (SHAK) announced customers would receive 15% of their purchases back in the form of bitcoin on any Shake Shack purchase made with Block’s (SQ) Cash App debit card, Cash Card. Nearly a year earlier, sandwich shop Quiznos partnered with Bakkt App to launch a pilot program to accept payments in bitcoin at select Quiznos outlets in Denver.  Flexa co-founder Trevor Filter says expanding digital currency payment options benefits both customers and companies.  “Chipotle benefits from reaching customers where they are through the new payment methods they want to use,” Filter told CoinDesk. “And, at the same time, Chipotle’s customers benefit from greater payment flexibility, faster checkout and a more seamless experience at the fast casual restaurants they already love.”  Read more: Gucci to Accept Crypto in Some US Retail Stores: Report",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/02/chipotle-now-accepting-cryptocurrency-payments-at-us-locations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/729dba41b70af1f4178d1994b1b3eaa96151fef0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395374,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvyrE,1654192301,US Labor Department Sued After Warning 401(k) Providers About Allowing Crypto Investments,"The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) in March issued a controversial warning to 401(k) plan fiduciaries to “exercise extreme care” before considering adding cryptocurrencies to a retirement plan’s investment menu. Today, the agency is being sued for it.  California-based 401(k) provider ForUsAll filed suit against the DOL in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, alleging the agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by issuing guidance without following the correct procedures. Those procedures, argued ForUsAll, would have required the guidance to go through a time-consuming notice and comment period.  The DOL skipped that step because it feared the impact of Super Bowl commercials that encouraged investors to put their retirement savings into crypto, and hurried the guidance out ahead of that event, alleged the plaintiff.  Aside from deviating from the proper procedure, ForUsAll claims the DOL’s “arbitrary and capricious” warning against crypto and threat of an “investigative program” against plans that offer such investments could set a “concerning precedent for future announcements by any Administration about what investments are permissible.”  “The DOL plays several important roles that serve American workers — but ‘armchair financial adviser’ shouldn’t be one of them,” said ForUsAll CEO Jeff Schulte in a statement provided to CoinDesk. “Congress never gave government officials the power to pick winners and losers, let alone the legal authority to arbitrarily restrict entire asset classes. And it certainly never authorized agencies to take such sweeping and abrupt action with no public process.”  The suit also pointed to President Joe Biden’s executive order (EO) on crypto, released one day before the DOL’s guidance. The White House directive urged various federal agencies – the DOL and Treasury Department among them – to collaborate on a whole-of-government approach to cryptocurrency regulation.  “No other federal department or agency has responded to the Executive Order in this fashion,” said ForUsAll, which also noted the EO's call to “promote” the development and use of cryptocurrency.  ForUsAll claims to have suffered damages as a result of the DOL’s guidance, and the suit asks the court to vacate and set aside the DOL’s crypto guidance, to prevent the DOL from acting to implement it, and from pursuing investigations outside its allowed scope.  ForUsAll Chief Investment Officer David Ramirez, told CoinDesk the company had received inquiries from more than 150 businesses after the announcement of its crypto 401(k) offering last June.  “However, since the Department of Labor announced that they are launching an enforcement initiative targeting businesses that add a crypto option to their plan menu, we have spoken with a number of clients — and of those we spoke with, roughly one-third have decided to delay making crypto investments available to their employees, as a direct result of the DOL’s threats,” Ramirez said.

42395368,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvylK,1654191904,The ‘Google of Blockchains’ Is Sunsetting Its Centralized Service,"The Graph – a service that helps applications collect and interpret blockchain-based data – announced Thursday that it will be sunsetting its centralized Hosted Service early next year.  Representatives for Edge & Node, the original team behind The Graph, did not provide an exact date for when the free Hosted Service will be phased out. They say app developers using the platform will be encouraged to migrate over to the pay-per-query Graph network, which relies on a distributed community of Ethereum-based “indexers” to handle data rather than the Hosted Network’s single operator. GRT is The Graph’s native token.  “This big vision that we’ve been trying to fulfill for years is now possible, and the big piece of that is you can make data decentralized,” Eva Beylin, director of the Graph Foundation, told CoinDesk. “This vision of open data – owning your own data – is now possible because now you’re relying on a network and not one company or one operator.”  The announcement, which came at The Graph’s “Graph Day” conference in San Francisco, marks a major step towards decentralization for the self-described “Google of Blockchains.” It will accompany new features and updates to The Graph’s core technology that will, according to the protocol’s leaders, soon render the free Hosted Service unnecessary.  The news also accompanied a proposal to expand The Graph’s decentralized network to Arbitrum, an Ethereum scaling solution with greater speeds and reduced fees.  As The Graph works to sunset its centralized hosted service, leading voices in tech and crypto are raising concerns that centralized infrastructure providers – services like The Graph’s Hosted Service that power most major Web 3 products behind the scenes – threaten crypto’s promise of “decentralization.”  What is The Graph?  Proponents of blockchain technology often pitch it as a way to make data open and transparent.  The reality is not so simple. Just as it was difficult to surf the web before the advent of search engines, blockchains of today are an amalgam of bits and bytes that can be difficult to interpret without the help of specialized tools. Blocks on a blockchain are just lists of transactions – in a sea of non-fungible token (NFT) sales and token swaps, individual transaction data doesn’t really mean much on its own.  This, Beylin says, is where The Graph comes in.  “The point of The Graph altogether is to organize blockchain data and make it easily accessible,” she told CoinDesk. “That can be for an application, a data dashboard or just regular analysis.”  App developers can configure their smart contracts so their data can be interpreted by The Graph and turned into so-called subgraphs. It’s sort of like how websites create an index file so they can be crawled by search engines.  “A subgraph can be anything from financial metrics … to things like art statistics, to things like voting metrics or proposals,” Beylin explained.  The Graph has been adopted by a long list of major projects – from the ArtBlocks NFT platform to Sushi’s decentralized exchange service – which benefit from the ability to gather and process vast quantities of blockchain data.  Decentralizing blockchain data  Bitcoin emerged in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a way to pull power away from a rigged financial system. Smart contract platforms like Ethereum extended this vision. By distributing power across a vast network of operators, these networks would theoretically enable builders to create products outside the reach of greedy institutions and corrupt bureaucrats.  Blockchain critics will say that this promise of “decentralization” is all marketing, and they have a point. In recent years, centralized services – from exchanges like Coinbase to infrastructure providers like Alchemy – have sacrificed some of blockchain technology’s core promises for the sake of convenience. Running a node is hard.  Beylin says The Graph launched its centralized Hosted Service in 2019 as a way to bootstrap the platform.  As for why the team planned to sunset the service “from the get go,” Beylin explained that “the Hosted Service is a single operator, meaning there’s a single server or a single database processing queries, which results in potential single points of failure.”  According to Beylin, The Graph’s Hosted Service was theoretically prone to the same vulnerabilities (data censorship, services outages, etc.) as the Metas and Amazons of the world – the same companies The Graph wants to disrupt.  On the other hand, The Graph’s decentralized network, which launched in 2020 and has grown to include over 160 individual “indexers,” is being framed as a more decentralized alternative.  “With the decentralized network, what people get is the security and that reliability that at any point their queries will be served,” said Beylin.  UPDATE (June 2, 18:12 UTC): The Graph Hosted Service launched in January 2019, not 2018.

42420963,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6l25,1654190249,Kimbal Musk and His Big Green DAO,"In the mid-1990s, when Kimbal Musk was 22 years old, he started working on a new and unproven technology called the “internet.” Along with his brother Elon, he helped create Zip2, a city guide that was one of the first online versions of the Yellow Pages.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  Not everyone got it. A guy who was maybe 50 years old and deeply skeptical picked up a copy of the actual Yellow Pages and threw it at Musk, saying, “Do you think you’ll ever replace this?!”  Musk was dumbfounded. He couldn’t speak; he just had to leave the room. In his mind, he knew the industry of paper directories was already dead. “It was a $10 billion business, and it was just gone,” he says now.  Flash forward 28 years. Now Musk is around the same age as the guy clinging to the paper directory business, and he sees parallels with Web 3. It’s true that “Blockchain is now where the internet was in the early 1990s” and has become an almost embarrassing cliche in the crypto space. But it’s also true that Kimbal Musk is one of the few people with the chops to back the claim. “I get to participate in this revolution as an older person,” says Musk. “And I just want to be a better older person.”  His “better older person” credentials are close to impeccable. He doesn’t speak about this often – almost never publicly – but in 2010, Musk was in a serious tubing accident that almost killed him. He landed on his head going 35 miles per hour. Blood seeped into his spine and left him paralyzed for days. As he told my colleague Christine Lee at ETHDenver, “I’m not a spiritual person, but I did get a message from God.” And the message was highly specific. The voice told him to work with kids and connect them with real food.  Musk listened to that voice.  He launched Big Green, a non-profit that built “Learning Garden” classrooms in 650 schools across the nation, teaching 350,000 kids each day. “I believe that growing food changes lives,” Musk said at ETHDenver. “It improves your nutrition security. It improves your mental health. It gets you out into nature. It opens your eyes to the weather volatility created by climate change.” (Musk’s ties to food run deep -- he owns a restaurant group in Colorado, he’s the co-founder of an urban farming group in Brooklyn, N.Y., and he’s a chef. Oh, and in his spare time he sits on the boards of his brother’s Tesla and SpaceX. The Musks are not lazy.)  Read More: Consensus 2022 Visitor Guide: Inside the DAOs  Then came COVID-19. Thanks to safety guidelines, suddenly the Learning Gardens were put on pause. Musk pivoted. He was intrigued by the idea of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and their potential to help nonprofits allocate funds more efficiently and equitably. The idea was simple: Frontline non-profit workers tend to know other frontline non-profit workers. They know the space. Maybe they should be making the decisions.  So, in the fall of 2021, Musk launched Big Green DAO. Here’s how it works: First, he kicked in $1 million of his own money as “skin in the game.” The DAO donors then selected six worthy non-profits, and each of the nonprofits received $50,000. Those six nonprofits then voted on which batch of recipients should receive the next round of funds – and each quarter they dole out more. Rinse and repeat.  The Big Green DAO is up and running; dollars are flowing to those who need it. The DAO has raised a total of $6.5 million. Over 1,700 people have donated. There are now 16 nonprofits – generally with a food justice bent – that, along with the donors, are voting on how to distribute the funds.  The ethos of crypto is “power to the people.” That’s usually just theoretical. Abstract. Here, in this one (big green) corner of the world it’s actually happening. There’s now less overhead. Less red tape. Easier applications. More community building. Most importantly, nonprofits are truly controlling where the money goes, something that, as Musk puts it, has “never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been done.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  So give us an update! How has the Big Green DAO worked in reality, compared to your expectations?  Kimbal Musk: It’s very different to how we envisioned it. We imagined there would be a small number of big donors and they would vote alongside the nonprofits.  I put in $1 million to kick off the experiment. In the first week we got a few hundred-thousand-dollar donors, and I was thinking, “Okay, this is about right. This is what I expected.”  But then we started getting many smaller donations … There's no minimum donation to participate. You have to donate a minimum of one ETH to be a voter, but if you donate even 1 cent you can join the Discord. We’re now at over 1,700 donors. And the average donation is $900.  Wow.  It really is extraordinary. We’ve also learned that the nonprofits really, really care about voting, because they get to have power for the first time in their lives. They're not voting on their own money, by the way. They cannot vote for themselves, they can only vote for others.  Can you explain the mechanics of the DAO a bit? How did this start, exactly?  Yeah. To kick it off, we found six rockstar nonprofits from around the country that we knew already.  What’s an example?  One African American woman in Atlanta, named Wande, fought the city of Atlanta to allow farm stands in South Atlanta. It's a Black neighborhood. You're allowed to do it in the white neighborhoods, but you're not allowed to do it in the Black neighborhoods. It's really messed up. And she fought for years to win that and she did win.  Read More: Kimbal Musk’s Big Green DAO Is a Big Step for Web 3  We have an African American woman from Minnesota who did garden parties after George Floyd was killed [in Minneapolis], to bring the community together. Or a Native American woman who works with reservations around the country to bring in philanthropy.  Just these beautiful amazing people who really understood – not just the power of having grant-making power – but also the responsibility that's now on their shoulders to do a good job, because it's never been done before.  What has never been done before, exactly?  To allow nonprofits to control where the funding goes. It has never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been done. And when I say control, they have total control. So, the donors do get a vote but the way it's working out is really interesting.  We gave six nonprofits the votes. I personally chose not to have a vote because I really wanted it to be run by the nonprofits.  They are required to give a minimum of 20% and a maximum of 30% of the treasury per quarter to other nonprofits. [So with a $1 million treasury, they’d be required to give away $200,000.] And if they don’t like the way the DAO is working, there is no requirement to stay in the DAO. They can leave at any time.  So has any money actually been dispersed?  They gave away $300,000 in Q1 this year and they spread it across 10 amazing nonprofits, and then they grew the DAO to 16 members.  And then they wanted to release some donor funds in this quarter. [The available donations] worked out to be about $2.9 million, which is amazing. So now they have $900,000 [30% of $2.9 million] to give away this quarter, and they have 16 nonprofits that will vote.  Right. The six original non-profits plus the 10 new ones. Can the donors vote, too?  This was something that I didn't expect. Most of the donors don't really want to vote. They believe the nonprofits really do know more than them.  What else has played out differently with the DAO than how you expected? Any surprising challenges?  Well, I would say that the onboarding process is much harder than we expected. So, I'm a techie. I thought it was pretty hard for me, but doable. When you're talking to non-techies, these are people who work in the real world, they build gardens in their communities, they do food justice. They don't even have a Twitter account. I mean, they live in the real world, and getting them to understand how a wallet works, getting them to understand why you even use this technology is so hard. It's hard to describe.  What I love about it is that we’re bringing these folks into the Web 3 world to show and give them this amazing power, and they’re appreciative of the power. But the onboarding is just so much harder than it needs to be.  One of the reasons you launched the Big Green DAO is to put grant-making authority in the hands of the front-line food workers, and hopefully that has a bigger impact. Has that happened? What does it look like?  Well, so the brass tacks of grant-making is important to understand. When you're a nonprofit, 25% of your time, resources,and people goes towards fundraising – 25%. Brutal.  And when you’re a foundation and you're giving money away, up to 15% of your resources goes towards personnel who will provide the grants.  I can see how that adds up.  Let's say you’re giving away $100 million. And this is per year. You're taking $15 million and providing it towards the staff who will figure out who’s going to get the grants, and then there’s the reporting and all that stuff.  Now you have $85 million. And you’re giving it to nonprofits that use 25% of their time towards fundraising. So the actual money that goes towards the work on the ground is 65%, maximum. You’re starting with 65% that goes to the real work.  And how does the DAO compare?  With our DAO, we have a 5% overhead allowance. So you’re starting with 95% of the money versus 65% of the money. Already, out of the gate, you have less headache for the nonprofits. You have no work needed for a foundation, so that's amazing.  I'm a philanthropist. I have a group of people that help me give money away, and it's very frustrating that it costs so much money and time to figure out how to give money away. So, you’re already starting with almost 50% more money than you would with traditional grant-making.  What other benefits have you found?  The other thing that’s amazing is that for nonprofits there's an emotional toll that comes with grant-making. That’s exhausting.  What they really want to do is good work on the ground. And they’re working super hard. And the ones we work with are just so good at what they do, but there's that emotional drag, ""Urgh, I've gotta do fundraising still."" It's really not what they wanna do. But they have to do it.  Right, no one likes asking for money!  And all of a sudden, with the Big Green DAO, here is a place where your grant application is a couple of sentences on Snapshot, and a link to your website or a link to your Instagram. The way you are brought into the DAO is just by knowing another member of the DAO. By the way, you don't have to know a member of the DAO to put yourself up on Snapshot, you can do that anyway – but [most people] just don't know about it.  Now you have a situation where you're able to raise funds, there are no strings attached and nothing is restricted. The better you build a relationship with the DAO, the more likely you’ll get funded [in the future]. But that's relationship building. That's fun, especially because you're working with other nonprofits, right?  It’s a very different psychological relationship to fundraising. It’s joyful and community-oriented, and you're getting to spend time with other amazing rock stars.  What are the mechanics of the DAO meetings? Is it all over Zoom?  We are not a virtual DAO. Every quarter, we bring the DAO together and they meet in person, and they talk about what they want to do next quarter. This past quarter, we added 10 nonprofits as well as some donors. They all met in Atlanta for two days and they got to know each other in person.  And this quarter they’re going to give funds to, let’s say, maybe 50 nonprofits. They’ll meet sometime in July. So the idea here is real-life community building and getting nonprofits to collaborate with each other, to share what they know. That community building is just magical.  For those out there who might be “DAO-curious,” what are some lessons you’ve learned about how DAOs actually work that you didn’t know before you launched?  That's a great question. And now that we’re in a bear market with Web 3, some people are saying, “Oh, DAOs are not really about decentralization."" I'm like, ""It's in the name, guys. Come on."" They're kind of backing off on it, and I think it's wrong.  I think that the power is in decentralized voting. The power is in enabling the community to vote together. The challenge is that there is an enormous amount of time and effort required for governance, and I put my 10,000 hours into governance.  How so?  We studied the American Constitution, how it was formed. We're obviously not the same thing, but what was really amazing about the American constitution and the Congress and the Senate, and so forth, is that it’s designed to prevent any one person from accumulating too much power. And that lesson is really important. Many of the DAOs out there are not really DAOs. There's one person with seven million votes and then 5,000 votes for the rest of the DAO. That's not really a DAO.  In our case, we are actually true to the spirit of a DAO. And we are not 100% on whether it will work or not – it’s an experiment – but it's going quite well. It’s an experiment in human nature; most humans are designed to accumulate power. And we can't really do that in our governance structure.  So for people who are DAO-curious, the most important lesson that I've learned is to understand governance.  What’s the most important governance principle in the Big Green DAO? And how do you prevent one big donor from making all the decisions? You’re a generous donor who put in $1 million. Could you just decide to impose your will?  Absolutely a great question. No matter how much you donate, you get one vote. So if you want to support decentralized grant-making and you want to give us a gazillion dollars, you get one vote. You’re with the non-profits on a peer level. [Musk recently tweeted to share the DAO’s newly ratified Constitution.]  It sounds like you’re really encouraged so far by the Big Green DAO. You’re obviously a man with a ton of other interests, from restaurants to large corporations. Where do you see DAOs being a good fit elsewhere in the world?  I really like to think about, very practically, when is decentralized decision-making valuable? And the world we have today is hierarchical. It’s top-down, it's using capitalism. The other system that has been tried a lot is communism, also basically a top-down system.  Read More: How Crypto Is Changing Philanthropy  But DAO is truly decentralized. It's really different. So I’ve worked with another group that's working on a DAO in reducing deforestation around the world. And that works really well for a DAO because you want to decentralize decisions, but you also want to decentralize accountability. You need decentralized accountability as well as decentralized decision-making to be effective.  Why does that matter, exactly?  Because what happens a lot in the world of deforestation – in both profit and nonprofit – is you pay someone not to destroy a piece of the land, and you really have no idea if they're doing it. So, that's a good example where a DAO would be very useful.  Where else would a DAO work?  Police reform. Because if you are doing police reform in Atlanta, for example, North Atlanta is very different from South Atlanta. You want to have a different lens for each community. And that's another group that's working on a DAO.  One of the examples that people come to me with all the time is climate change. And I kind of struggle with that being a DAO, because it's really a worldwide problem. How does decentralizing decisions make a difference? And they have their ways of doing it. But I'm much more about the brass tacks of, “Is decentralized decision-making helping or not?"" And I think that it's very much about the problem you’re trying to solve.  You have your tools: There’s capitalism, there's communism, there's philanthropy. There's traditional hierarchical philanthropy, and then there's the DAOs. DAOs could be for-profit or nonprofit. You should look at all the tools in your belt to see which is the best tool to apply to solve that [problem].  Like, I would never run Tesla as a DAO. That’s just not appropriate because you're managing a supply chain. You can't decentralize that. You cannot run that as a DAO.  Have you had any conversations with your brother about it? He’s obviously been very crypto-curious in the past, and he’s clearly an innovative thinker. Have you discussed DAOs with him, and seen any interest at all in his part?  You know, honestly, I haven't. I'm just very careful to stay out of my brother's... Because he is such a high-profile guy, I think it's better for him to figure that out himself. And whenever I cough in that direction, people would take it seriously. So honestly, I really haven’t.  Wise man.

42374450,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZVxN,1654189699,Staked Ether Discount After Terra Collapse a Sign of Liquidity Crunch in Crypto,"Staked ether (stETH), a token from the Lido protocol that's supposed to trade at a price close to ether (ETH), has been changing hands at a sustained discount since the collapse of the Terra network – possibly a signal that liquidity has dried up in crypto markets.  Data shows that staked ether and ether traded at parity up until May 7, when Terra’s stablecoin, UST, started to wobble from its $1 peg. Since then, stETH has been unable to recover to the full ETH price. On May 12, when UST dropped to 7 cents, stETH-ETH exchange ratio fell to as low as 0.955, and ever since then, staked ether has traded at a discount of 2-3%.  The discount is a result of an “illiquidity frenzy” that UST’s implosion set off in an already tightening macro environment, as Terra enthusiasts realized they were overexposed and began selling other coins out of panic, Fundstrat analyst Walter Teng told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  “At this point, there’s no new money coming into crypto,” Teng said.  After UST’s crash, “everyone is testing, everyone wants to catch another emperor without clothes. In stETH’s case, shorters are betting against the ETH Merge succeeding, a liquidity event for stETH,"" he said.  Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, also called “the Merge,” is scheduled for August after many delays. If it is delayed again or doesn't succeed, stETH holders would be stuck with their investment, and so it makes sense that they might demand compensation now for bearing that risk.  Liquidity crunch  A good indication for liquidity becoming scarce on the crypto market is the overall market capitalization of stablecoins – the main source of liquidity for crypto traders and considered to be a safe haven from volatility – sinking as people panicked and pulled out money from cryptocurrencies in May.  On top of that, the Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates and reducing its balance sheet, tightening conditions in money markets and lending while investors sell risky assets such as equities and crypto in a bid for safety.  Ethereum is making a transition to a consensus mechanism where stakers validate transactions and propose new blocks from proof-of-work where so-called miners run machines using electricity.  Lido is a decentralized finance application that allows ETH holders to put up tokens to validate transactions to earn a yield. Investors receive the staked ether token at a one-to-one ratio and can use it as lending collateral or across supported trading pools.  The caveat is that holders cannot “unstake” – redeem and sell – their staked ether until the Merge happens.  As a result, the staked ether’s lower prices is a result of an “illiquidity discount” during a time of turmoil when traders prize investments that can be easily sold.  Dustin Teander, an analyst at the blockchain data platform Messari, said that “there aren't a ton of natural incentives at the moment for getting back to price parity.” He added that Lido voted to issue new rewards to the Curve pool to support the price parity, and it appears to be working as the discount inched toward 2%.  Lido is crucial for ether because it holds 91% of all liquid staked ether in its staking pools and manages about $7.8 billion in ether altogether, according to data platform DefiLlama.  Danny Ryan, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, wrote Wednesday that liquid staking derivative platforms such as Lido pose unique risks to Ethereum if they grow too large and may lead to the “cartelization” of the ether staking market.  A Goldman Sachs report said earlier in May that the staked ether price discount in the wake of the Terra collapse might indicate that the interconnections in decentralized finance increase systemic risk.  Ether (ETH) exchanged hands at $1,815 at press time, while Lido staked ether (stETH) was trading at $1,785, according to crypto price tracker CoinGecko.

The digital asset had been the victim of multiple outflows that had tanked its total AuM (Assets under management) and this trend has continued this week. Instead of moving to a larger competitor, Bitcoin, institutional investors are now moving to networks that are in direct competition with Ethereum. Big Money Leaves Ethereum To Algorand Algorand is one of the leading competitors of Ethereum which has been making waves in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Due to this, more institutional investors have been choosing to pitch their tent with the smart contract platform. What this has led to is the movement of institutional investors out of Ethereum and into competitors like Algorand. Related Reading | Cardano TVL Jumps 30% In 24 Hours As It Recovers To $155 Million Data from last week shows that while Ethereum continues to fall out of favor with big money, Algorand has been right behind it to soak up all of the inflows. This saw inflows into the DeFi protocol reach $20 million. It is a new high for the digital asset and is evidence of growing interest in other DeFi protocols besides Ethereum. As for the leading smart contract platform, outflows continue to rock the asset. It saw a total of $11.6 million leaving last week.

42421546,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocbF,1654189132,Responding to the 26 Anti-Crypto Technologists,"One potential way of measuring the actual size of the cryptocurrency industry might be in square footage. It sounds bizarre but this mostly synthetic, digital asset class actually has a growing footprint.  The New York Times published an article on how “The Crypto Bros Are Snapping Up Manhattan Real Estate” on Sunday. It had a stronger headline than the article supports, but did provide a look into one aspect of this rapidly professionalizing industry.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Crypto and related companies are believed to occupy less than a million square feet of an estimated 4.4 billion square feet of office space in the United States,” the article reads. What’s more, many realtors are looking at potential tenants not as gambles that could go up in flames, but like a “mom and pop” business.  This seems like a healthy attitude. Crypto is risky, but it’s a genuine economic opportunity for some.  See also: The Real Benefits of Blockchain Are Here  Compare that to another supposed dose of reality: This week a group of 26 concerned technology experts, writers and academics wrote an open letter to the U.S. Congress urging “a critical, skeptical approach toward [the] industry.”  In particular, the signatories took aim at the braggadocious claims that some in crypto have made as well as the predatory schemes that run rampant. It was meant to counter the increased crypto industry lobbying in Washington, D.C., and, speaking honestly, was mostly fair.  “As software engineers and technologists with deep expertise in our fields, we dispute the claims made in recent years about the novelty and potential of blockchain technology,” they wrote.  Crypto’s response, never of a single voice, was also measured. Some noted that 26 people – even experts – could not speak for a global industry. Others challenged specific language that sets crypto up like a strawman, such as the line that “not all innovation is unqualifiedly good” – a claim no one in crypto has made.  And though the letter writers correctly say many crypto boosters have financial exposure to the asset class and are therefore biased, a similar claim could be levied against them. Stephen Diehl, for instance, a London-based software engineer and long-standing critic of “public blockchains,” has for years drawn a paycheck from an “enterprise blockchain” firm.  Other signatories have worked, or still work, for Big Tech firms including Microsoft and Apple that theoretically stand to lose if crypto’s open-source ethos challenges their market share and business lines around private software.  Further, the claim that applications for crypto are “at best still ambiguous and at worst non-existent” is a pretty strong opinion that’s not entirely born out by fact. Tools are being built and used, Bitcoin has been running for 13 years straight. It’s just that crypto thrives at the edges.  In many cases, crypto works exactly as advertised: a means for “censorship-resistant” transactions. The whole financial and cultural apparatus that grows around that should take that simple premise to heart. The problem is when crypto doesn’t.  Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, wrote a considered thread on Twitter in response to the letter. He was particularly dismayed that people he once considered “fellow travelers” have soured on his network and the industry at large. He mentions sci-fi author and journalist Cory Doctorow by name, but other open-source advocates might be implicated.  Although once a soft supporter of crypto, Doctorow has grown increasingly concerned with the financialization of the industry and the potential for crypto to financialize all aspects of human existence – turning friendships into benefit games and our public data into a monetizable product.  See also: 'Probably Nothing': Why People Still Hate Crypto | The Node  This is a real concern, I think, if crypto stakes out the aim of “mass adoption.” Blockchains were not built for such use, and in fact literally cannot scale to such a level with the current technology. But blockchain – with its transaction finality, irreversibility and costs of using – is extraordinarily good at ensuring those that need it most can have access.  The writers do not call for increased regulation. However, that is the logical endgame if crypto grows too large for itself especially at an unnatural pace catalyzed by venture capital and retail speculation.  Agree or disagree with these claims or with the 26 letter writers, but know it doesn’t matter. In addressing Congress, or in being concerned with governmental retaliation, they’re already missing the point. The true kernel of crypto hasn’t left, even if it’s surrounded by a speculative bubble.  The government was never supposed to support unstoppable, totally sovereign transactions. Not everyone will want to use these systems, but crypto grows by voluntary adoption. Or as Paul Dylan-Ennis said, it’s about “carving out” space from the existing, problematic world.  “[W]e can't fix everything but we can 'live as if we are already free,'” he wrote.  Last winter, SubStack writer Casey Newton wrote about a “vibe shift” happening across tech and tech journalism. Where public or state concern over tech was once centered around effective regulation of Big Tech behemoths, that now seems unlikely.  The vibe shift is instead to think about how solutions could be built from the ground up, in Web 3 and beyond. Writers, the public and the government all have a responsibility to look at this skeptically, Newton wrote. But he also suggests people “assume U.S.-led efforts to regulate tech will come to nothing, and allocate coverage resources accordingly.”  That’s practical advice for an industry with a pretty tiny footprint.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/06/02/responding-to-the-26-anti-crypto-technologists,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5c208c1e23ece4747c092322fd7086925482881-2048x1367.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The layoffs were made as cryptocurrency prices have suffered an extended downturn and international markets have also suffered, according to Bloomberg.  “We have had to make tough decisions to be able to navigate through this period of uncertainty and we can confirm we have downsized our Rain workforce,” Rain CEO Joseph Dallago said in a statement provided to Bloomberg. A Rain spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk that the statement was made by Dallago, but provided no additional details.  Rain has between 251 and 500 employees, according to Crunchbase, while LinkedIn puts the number at 501-1,000.  The move follows news on Thursday from crypto exchange and custodian Gemini that it is laying off about about 10% of its workers amid “turbulent market conditions.” And last week, Argentinian exchange Buenbit announced it was cutting 45% of its staff because of the tech downturn, while top Latin American exchange Bitso said it was laying off 80 employees.  Rain Financial raised $6 million in January in a round of financing led by Middle Eastern venture capital firm MEVP Capital with Coinbase as one of the participants.

42411784,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzR3,1654187875,What Is Proof-of-Authority?,"One major evolving element of blockchain technology is consensus mechanisms. After the original proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW) methods were developed, other consensus mechanisms came into fruition.  Read More: Proof-of-Stake vs. Proof-of-Work  One such consensus mechanisms is proof-of-authority (PoA), which has been introduced as a more energy-efficient alternative to PoS as less computational resources are needed.  This guide will explain the PoA network's principles.  Proof-of-authority explained  Proof-of-authority is a consensus algorithm that delivers an efficient solution for blockchains, specifically private ones. The term was coined in 2017 by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain.  In proof-of-authority, machines earn the right to generate new blocks by passing a strict vetting process, which is discussed in detail in the next section. As a result, trustworthy validation machines protect PoA blockchains. These system moderators are preapproved participants who check blocks and transactions.  The proof-of-authority model is scalable because it is based on a small number of block validators. VeChain (VET) is an example of a popular platform that uses a PoA algorithm.  How does proof-of-authority work?  Preapproved validators use software to organize transactions into blocks. The process is automated, and so the validators don't need to monitor their computers constantly. That, however, means that validators must keep their computers (admin sites) in good working order.  Terms for proof-of-authority consensus  Although conditions differ from one system to the other, to be chosen as a validator, a user must meet these three basic requirements:  A validator should be trustworthy, of good moral standards and without any criminal record.  A validator's identity must be formally validated on the network, with the ability to cross-check the information in the public domain. Therefore, the real identities of validators are confirmed.  A validator candidate should be willing to invest money and stake their own reputation. A rigorous process reduces the possibility of selecting questionable validators and encourages a long-term commitment.  The essence of the reputation mechanism is trust in the validator's identity. It is a complex process to ensure weak candidates are weeded out. This guarantees that all validators follow the same procedure, ensuring the system's integrity and reliability.  Let’s take an example of a reputational rating mechanism within eBay (EBAY). In the beginning, all sellers are subjugated to rules of the platform and feedback from buyers.  A seller with a 100% positive feedback score earns buyers’ trust, which affects the trust and reputation of eBay. Sellers with low feedback ratings, however, receive warnings and fewer seller privileges. Sellers receiving consistently low positive feedback scores are filtered from eBay, leaving the reputable sellers with high positive feedback to continue selling on the platform.  Just as reputation is critical on eBay, reputation for verifying is also critical in PoA.  Users who receive the right to become validators due to the PoA algorithm have an incentive to keep their rating high. Validators are motivated to maintain a stable transaction process to avoid tarnishing their reputation, which is tied to their real-life identity. As a result, most users value their hard-won role as a validator.  Terms for proof-of-authority consensus  Although conditions differ from one system to the other, a coherent PoA algorithm is dependent on the following:  Individuals who are active and trustworthy (validators who must identify themselves).  Validators who are willing to invest money and risk their reputation. A rigorous process reduces the possibility of selecting questionable validators and encourages long-term commitment.  A validator approval standard: Every validator follows the same procedure, ensuring the system's integrity and reliability.  Read more: A (Short) Guide to Blockchain Consensus Protocols  Proof-of-authority advantages  PoA differentiates itself from other consensus mechanisms such as PoW and PoS in two main ways:  There are more transactions per second that can be executed.  Less computational resources are needed.  Proof-of-authority disadvantages  The PoA mechanism is considered to be centralized as validators are preapproved. This consensus algorithm model is primarily an attempt to improve the efficiency of centralized systems. Although PoA systems have high bandwidth, immutability aspects are called into question as censorship and blacklisting are easily implemented.  Another common critical issue is that everyone has access to the identity of PoA validators. The counterargument is that only recognized players can hold this position, and they will always strive to become validators (as publicly known participants). However, knowing the validator's identity may allow third parties to manipulate the system.

42395361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvyeR,1654187607,CFTC Sues Gemini Over Bitcoin Futures Case From 2017,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Gemini Trust Company LLC Thursday on allegations the crypto exchange’s staff misled the federal regulator during Gemini’s 2017 effort to launch trading of what would have been a landmark bitcoin (BTC) futures contract.  In a 28-page civil suit, a copy of which was obtained by CoinDesk, the swaps regulator accused Gemini, which is owned by the Winklevoss twins, of providing misleading answers about how easily a bitcoin futures contract’s price could be manipulated during summertime meetings in 2017. CFTC said Gemini’s “false or misleading statements and omissions” happened in in-person meetings.  ""The false or misleading statements and information conveyed or omitted to Commission staff by Gemini directly and through others were material to evaluation of the Bitcoin Futures Contract, including compliance with core principles of the Commodity Exchange Act,” the suit said. “Such statements and information were relevant to, among other things, assessing the size of, liquidity on, and number of market participants using the Gemini Exchange and the Gemini Bitcoin Auction.”  Later, the suit said the CFTC evaluated how “readily susceptible to manipulation” the bitcoin futures contract would be.  “In oral and written communications to Commission staff during the Relevant Period, Gemini represented that it was a ‘full reserve’ exchange and that it required all transactions to be fully ‘pre-funded,’” the suit said. “Gemini represented that the ‘prefunding’ aspect of the Gemini Exchange made the Gemini Exchange and the Gemini Bitcoin Auction, and thus the Bitcoin Futures Contract, less susceptible to manipulation because it increased traders’ cost of capital and made improper trading conduct more expensive to malicious actors.”  However, these statements were either false, misleading or “omitted material information,” the CFTC alleged.  Gemini was trying to reduce the capital cost for market participants to boost trading volumes, the CFTC alleged, including by loaning thousands of bitcoin to market participants.  Gemini also allegedly sent some customers advances, allowing them to immediately trade before the participants had fully funded their accounts.  Gemini also claimed to prevent market participants from trading with themselves, which was not accurate, the agency alleged.  The suit does not specify if the effort was tied to Gemini’s partnership with Cboe to launch the first bitcoin futures contracts at the time.  In a statement, a Gemini spokesperson said, “Gemini has been a pioneer and proponent of thoughtful regulation since day one. We have an eight-year track record of asking for permission, not forgiveness, and always doing the right thing. We look forward to definitively proving this in court.”  In a press release published after this article, CFTC Acting Director of Enforcement Gretchen Lowe said, “Making false or misleading statements to the CFTC in connection with a futures product certification undermines the CFTC’s work to ensure the financial integrity of all transactions subject to the CEA, protect market participants, deter and prevent price manipulation, and promote responsible innovation and fair competition. This enforcement action sends a strong message that the Commission will act to safeguard the integrity of the market oversight process.”  Danny Nelson contributed reporting.

42395377,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvytC,1654184854,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Bounces Back From 'Hurricane' Though Miners Are Selling,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off for a holiday in the U.K.)  Price point: Bitcoin managed to tick back above $30K, as lower oil prices buoy traditional markets.  Market Moves: Bitcoin traders have been speculating for years that an economic ""hurricane"" might be in the making, much like the one that JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon is now warning traditional investors about.  Feature: Highlights from Helene Braun's Q&A with FTX US President Brett Harrison.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) bounced back above $30,000 in early trading, hours after a 6.2% dump on Wednesday.  Solana's SOL tokens were also finding support after tumbling 12% on Wednesday, when the network was halted by a bug linked to certain cold-storage transactions.  In traditional markets, crude oil fell after reports that U.S. President Joe Biden might visit Saudi Arabia this month. European stocks gained and U.S. stock futures were higher on speculation that lower energy prices might help to slow inflation.  ICYMI: CoinDesk's Eliza Gkritsi and Aoyon Ashraf reported that a squeeze on bitcoin-mining profit margins – think lower crypto prices and higher energy costs – might be forcing miners to sell some down some of their bitcoin inventories to pay for the extra operating costs. The miners also might want to set aside more (fiat currency) liquidity reserves for what could be an extended crypto bear market.  Market Moves  An economic 'hurricane' on the way?  Warnings of a coming economic ""hurricane"" on Wednesday by Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank, rattled traditional investors.  But the note of caution may have resonated with many crypto traders who have been speculating for years that economic and financial conditions looked unsustainable.  One bet is that the U.S. Federal Reserve might be sufficiently unnerved by downward-sloping stock prices to ease off its campaign to tighten monetary conditions, which it has said is necessary to tame inflation. But this thread of market logic was somewhat undermined this week when President Joe Biden held a meeting with Fed Chair Jerome Powell and essentially pledged to let the Fed do what it needs to do.  That means ongoing fears of further Federal Reserve monetary tightening could put a lid on any immediate rally for bitcoin. Arthur Hayes wrote in the latest post for his ""Crypto Trader Digest"" blog on the BitMEX website that a bull market in risky assets probably wouldn't begin anew until ""the Fed and its sycophantic cadre of other central bankers reverse course.""  ""There are no easy outs when you combine the most levered domestic U.S. and global economy in history, interest rates that are already at their lowest in recorded human history, the disruption of the world’s largest energy and food exporters (Russia + Ukraine), and inflation that was already at its highest in 40 years even before the Russia/Ukraine war,"" Hayes wrote.  Feature: Q&A With FTX US President Brett Harrison  CoinDesk's Helene Braun spoke with FTX US President Brett Harrison at last week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Here are some highlights:  I want to talk a little bit about the correlation between the crypto market and the equities market. Do you see that correlation breaking anytime in the future and if so, what do you think could break it?  Right now, we're in a global environment where assets are going down. That's true across equities, bonds, broad-based futures of various kinds, crypto, and there's a lot of macroeconomic factors going into these down moves. There's also specific things to crypto, for example, in everything that happened with the Terra ecosystem. What we're finding now is, as crypto gains more mainstream adoption, that means that more institutions are allocating percentage of their portfolios of crypto, which means in a down move when they're looking for things to sell, crypto is going to be in the line of fire just like everything else. And so in a doubt, in a sort of violent downturn, all correlations go to one, everything is going down. And so right now, as prices are decreasing across the board, of course, there's going to be high correlation between these assets. As the market starts to turn around, I think we're going to see more growth, idiosyncratic moves between crypto and the traditional equity markets.  Do you see more institutional investors exiting or entering this phase right now during the current market sell-off?  That's a good question. I think it's really going to be a mix. We're going to see some institutions that think this could be a perfect time to reenter the market at favorable prices. We're going to see some that feel that even though the sort of contagion of the Terra meltdown was sort of contained, they might see that as a reason to be more skeptical of crypto as a whole asset class and might cool off on investment, whether that's public or private investments. So we are going to see a mix for that over time. But in general, so much capital has moved into the private equity space in crypto. There's a lot of teams that are building and creating new infrastructure, building out new projects that we're probably going to see a lot of that investment come back over time.

In April, an attacker bought a controlling stake of Beanstalk tokens, then used that position to exploit the governance structure, voting to send themself all of Beanstalk’s funds.  “The Barn Raise” fundraiser will begin at 12 p.m. ET on June 6 and last until all of the so-called fertilizer tokens are sold, according to a press release.  Beanstalk will sell 77 million fertilizer tokens for 1 USDC each, and will borrow that $77 million in exchange for debt at up to 500% interest. Fertilizer holders will receive a pro rata share of one-third of newly minted beans, Beanstalk’s native stablecoin. The protocol said that about $10 million in funds (or 15% of available fertilizer tokens) have already been committed.  As part of the fundraiser, Beanstalk will also launch a 10,000-item non-fungible token (NFT) series, The Barn Raise NFT Collection, which will be made available to the first participants contributing at least 1,000 USDC before the protocol’s relaunch.  Beanstalk will formally resume operations in early July after two separate security audits are completed.  The Beanstalk decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) said it is working to strengthen the governance structure, switching to a community-run multisignature wallet custodied by nine Beanstalk community members – a short-term solution until a more robust security mechanism is developed, audited and implemented.  Beanstalk was among a wave of high-profile attacks that kicked off 2022, which also included an over $326 million loss for blockchain bridge Wormhole and a $625 million exploit of Axie Infinity’s Ronin blockchain that U.S. officials linked to North Korea.",NEUTRAL,USDC,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | USDC | RON,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/02/beanstalk-stablecoin-protocol-barn-raise-aims-to-restore-77m-in-lost-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a130d2448384387a9d63e8dff46c44a0ce03d44-4973x3315.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The organization has taken additional steps in the rapidly expanding digital assets field in the past year. The organization stated that it would use CBDCs to take the next step toward seamless crypto cross-border payments. They will carry out this plan in partnership with Capgemini. The Shift From Local to Global CBDCs are digital representations of currency that central banks issue. Greater emphasis has been placed on how CBDCs can achieve domestic policy objectives. However, there is a growing interest in their use for international purposes. Nonetheless, one risk comes with their use: international transactions. The Chief Innovation Officer at SWIFT, Thomas Zschach, has made it known that for the company to maximize the use of CBDCs, they must facilitate their collaboration and connection with different companies that can help. Different central banks are developing their digital currencies based on different technologies, standards, and protocols, threatening the global CBDC ecosystem. This could lead to creating &apos;digital islands&apos; throughout the globe. Therefore, different systems and CBDCs must be able to work well together.

42393817,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBb79,1654179545,"Coinbase Doesn’t Offer Liability Protection, but That’s No Reason to Panic","Some investors and financial advisers were taken aback in recent weeks as one of the oldest and most trusted digital asset exchanges and custody providers announced that it might not be as secure as they had once assumed.  On top of announcing a major earnings miss, Coinbase warned its users last month that they don't enjoy protection from liability in the case of bankruptcy, potentially putting nearly $256 billion in investor assets at risk.  “The crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings,” the company stated in its first-quarter earnings report.  Advisers should understand that for many diehard cryptocurrency investors, the announcement was much ado about nothing. Most dedicated crypto aficionados hold their own assets and put tokens on an exchange like Coinbase only temporarily. But many newcomers to digital assets prefer the relative simplicity of keeping their tokens where they bought them, just as they would stocks and funds bought through an online broker.  Read more: Despite Recent Bumps in the Road, Stablecoins Will Stick Around  Coinbase’s announcement is a reminder that to this point digital custodians aren't the same as the brokerages and banks that serve the traditional financial industry and cannot offer investors the same assurances as the incumbents – yet.  The regulatory question  “I think this is in large part a function of the fact that we do not yet have regulatory clarity around the custody of digital assets,” said Marcel Kasumovich, head of research at One River Asset Management, an institutional digital asset manager. “Regulators haven’t taken time to revise their rules yet because this asset class went from nothing to something relevant in a very short period of time.”  A bank account is protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for up to $250,000 worth of deposits in checking, savings and money market accounts as well as certain certificates of deposit. A traditional investment account enjoys up to $500,000 worth of coverage from the Securities Investor Protection Corp., which covers stocks, Treasurys, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds and money market funds. There is, thus far, no analog insurance for digital assets.  In fact, according to Kasumovich, it is uncertain what exactly would happen to crypto assets if an exchange or custodian declares bankruptcy.  Read more: Coinbase Has ‘Structural Advantage’ Over Competitors, Cowen Analyst Says  “We don’t know with certainty what happens to custodied assets because we do not yet have definitive guidance,” he said. “Coinbase was doing their duty by disclosing that they do not have protections in place.”  Coinbase has publicly stated that it isn't at risk of declaring bankruptcy. In a scenario where a Coinbase-like company does declare bankruptcy, however, a court will have to figure out which assets go to which creditor.  In some prior bankruptcy cases, assets that were well-defined and attributed to individuals separate from the insolvent entity could at times be shielded from creditors, Kasumovich said.  “If I, as a person, held assets segregated from that business which were known to be mine, especially if they were held somewhere like a cold storage wallet with specific addresses on the blockchain identifying me as the owner of those assets, it would be really odd for that known asset to be reallocated to a creditor funding a different business line,” he said. “In such a case, I would be technically hiring Coinbase or whoever to care for my keys and all of those other things, but when I log in, I would see my account and my place on the chain. They couldn’t easily say that now, because of a bankruptcy in a shared core business, my assets belong to Goldman Sachs or some other creditor.”  While there is little prior case law to depend on, Kasumovich said a court would likely recognize that someone’s crypto holdings, identifiable on the blockchain, are segregated from those of the exchange or custody provider.  Enduring uncertainty  “Eventually we’re going to get visibility on how digital assets fit into the Commercial Code and what it means to be a custodial institution both in the context of the Advisers Act, the custody rule and the Federal Reserve,” he said. “All of this stuff is transitional. It adds to the uncertainty, but it’s just a bridge to integrating digital into the financial regulatory mainstream.”  In the meantime, advisers and investors should pay close attention to the specifics of custody, namely who safeguards their assets and where exactly those assets are being held.  Under today’s laws, self-custody may be the safest way to hold digital assets, Kasumovich said, but if investors want to hold their assets on an exchange or with some other type of digital custodian, they should look for services operating in New York state or in a place with similar regulatory standards, because those places provide the best protections in the case of bankruptcy. Investors should also look for custody providers who are independently capitalized.  “Self-custody is mostly a matter of comfort level,” he said. “I think we’ll be getting regulatory [clarity] on what self-custody actually means within the next six months. There’s a lot coming on the regulatory side, not everything will be what people want to see but just having clarity on the rules of engagement will be helpful.”  Read more: Crypto Investing Means Staying Positive Amid Volatility",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/02/coinbase-doesnt-offer-liability-protection-but-thats-no-reason-to-panic,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42395373,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvyqF,1654171200,"Canonical Crypto Launches $20M Inaugural Fund Backed by Marc Andreessen, Chris Dixon","Canonical Crypto, a newly opened venture capital firm, has raised $20 million for its inaugural fund to back infrastructure projects for blockchain development, with a preference for talent making the transition from Web 2 to Web 3.  The fund was backed by a list of crypto heavy-hitters, including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) partners Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon.  Other investors included Coinbase Ventures corporate development head Shan Aggarwal, Dragonfly Capital's Haseeb Quresh, FTX Ventures partner Amy Wu and several family offices.  “The thesis is really focused on the world I grew up in, which is developer infrastructure,” Canonical Crypto founder Anand Iyer told CoinDesk in an interview. “I feel like we’re at that phase in crypto right now where we just need better infrastructure. ... We need better airports to support all of the planes that are flying.”  Canonical origins  Iyer founded Canonical Crypto late last year after shifting from traditional tech to the crypto space. He previously spent several years at Microsoft, including a stint as the tech giant’s ambassador to the Silicon Valley developer community. Iyer then co-founded sports-centric mobile developer HItpost (acquired by Yahoo in 2013) and Trusted Child Care, which was acquired by Care.com.  Noticing a growing interest in blockchain technology among his Silicon Valley friends, Iyer said he dove in, launching his own decentralized finance (DeFi) coursework and joining Pear VC to lead crypto and blockchain investments.  Canonical Crypto was born out of a desire to support early-stage founders building blockchain infrastructure, which Iyer defines as anything that can make developers more productive from code collaboration to testing to security to storage. Amazon Web Services is the development bundle used by many in Web 2, and Iyer sees the need to unbundle similar services for Web 3.  Investment strategy  Iyer received advice from noted venture capitalists Andreessen and Dixon while he was crafting the fund and Dixon recommended “focusing on what you can do extremely well.”  Canonical Crypto expects to invest in 40 to 50 projects with the first fund, writing checks ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 for pre-seed to seed round investments. The firm will offer operational support with a focus on helping founders figure out how to tailor their tooling for the right set of users and a go-to-market strategy to get the solution to the best audience.  The fund has already made initial investments in several companies, including Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Formfunction, low-code decentralized application development platform Thirdweb, communication infrastructure provider Notifi and Solana-focused data infrastructure solution Vybe Network.  Canonical Crypto is launching its first fund during a cryptocurrency bear market that hasn’t dissuaded venture capital investments.

The beta version is now live for users to sign up and will be released to the wider public in the coming weeks, according to a press release.  Popular Web 3 products, such as OpenSea, Aave and 0x, were developed through Alchemy. Product manager Michael Garland told CoinDesk that Alchemy is excited to cater to the “existing, thriving, very passionate ecosystem of developers that have grown up natively on Solana.”  “We haven't been able to help them out with our existing tooling,” he said, noting the new platform will help developers save time and accelerate product development. “I’m super excited about making the lives of Solana developers much easier,” Garland added.  Though Alchemy introduced Ethereum scaling solutions only last June, Solana Labs Head of Communications Austin Federa said the chain’s efficiency makes it a good platform for developers looking to take their products to Web 3 from Web 2.  “The hope of Solana” is to move “from a world where transactions are scarce and expensive, and slow, to a world where transactions are fast, cheap and readily available,” Federa told CoinDesk.

42395375,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvypG,1654165495,"DeFi 'Casino' May Need New Global Regulator, German Central Banker Says","A German central banker has called for a bank-style international standard-setter for financial-technology innovations while dismissing decentralized finance (DeFi) as a “casino” for speculators.  Joachim Wuermeling called for discussions “now” on how to treat the fast growing segment of blockchain-based finance that could make banks redundant.  The move comes after international organization the Financial Stability Board (FSB) was asked to develop new rules for the crypto sector – and amid a fierce debate over the right way to regulate financial services that aren’t controlled by a single entity.  “To me, DeFi seems more like a casino for tech-savvy speculators,” Wuermeling, a member of the Deutsche Bundesbank's executive board responsible for bank supervision and IT, said in a speech on Thursday.  DeFi “is growing quickly, and so might its ties to the rest of finance and the economy … we need to be discussing regulatory options now,” he added, though said there are “still too many hurdles to be cleared” for the technology to become fully mainstream.  ""I could imagine having a global forum akin to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ... that could set global ground rules for digital innovation,"" Wuermeling said, referring to the international organization that sets capital rules for conventional lenders, such as Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase.  “Digitalization knows no borders,” he said. “That is why we have to coordinate across national borders when we design regulation.”  The move follows calls by major developed nations to the FSB to speed up regulations that would mean crypto is treated like regular finance. A spokesperson for the FSB told CoinDesk that no timeline has yet been set for that work, though a separate report on stablecoins is due in October.  Read more: G-7 Finance Ministers Call to Accelerate Global Crypto Regulations Following UST Collapse: Report  But opinions are divided on exactly how those rules, designed to regulate specific centralized entities such as banks and funds, would apply in the world of DeFi.  Activities, not entities  A recent study produced for the EU’s Blockchain Observatory called for regulators’ approach to shift from regulating specific institutions to activities, such as lending or investment. Meanwhile, a Wednesday report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which hosts the FSB and Basel Committee, favors an approach known as embedded supervision, under which regulators are given a privileged perch within DeFi code.  Others, such as Joshua Ellul, director of the Centre for Distributed Ledger Technologies at the University of Malta, have suggested a step-by-step approach, where, in the first instance, DeFi applications must appoint real-life fiduciaries to discharge regulatory obligations, such as audit.  “Over time, regulators, once they realize this is working, could even say … ‘You no longer need an accountant'... and they can remove that requirement,” Ellul told CoinDesk. “I don't see it as an immediate, complete decentralized regulation. I see this gradually removing certain centralized points.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | LUNA | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/02/defi-casino-may-need-new-global-regulator-german-central-banker-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6d763e0fcf6cf7799c29a671ba5515c9addce0b-8064x3390.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The first choice is spot trading (e.g. buying BTC). However, in this case, investors can only profit from their crypto holding when the price rises against the volatility of the crypto market. The second choice is to trade derivatives. For instance, when trading delivery contracts, investors can earn more profits from price swings via high leverage compared with their spot returns. Yet they could not hold onto their delivery contracts over the long run as such contracts will eventually expire, which is where the third option comes in — futures contracts. Although both are financial derivatives, futures contracts differ from delivery contracts because they do not have any expiration/settlement days, which means that an investor could hold onto a futures contract indefinitely. Unlike spot traders, futures traders can open a position and start trading without having to own the underlying asset. Thanks to its many advantages, futures contracts now make up half of the crypto market in terms of the trading volume. Many crypto trading platforms now offer futures contracts. In terms of their functions, these platforms can be roughly divided into two categories: entry-level platforms and pro-level platforms.

The 24-hour trading volume of the Ark is $287 Million, indicating a hike of 6200%. Past Performance of ARK The overall prevailing trend remains to be bearish in the ARK price chart, as the highly influential bearish trendline keeps the downtrend moving.

The bullish failure increases the chances of a downtrend breaking under $0.50 to retest the bottom support at $0.37. The Daily Moving Averages - 20 100, 200 maintain a bearish alignment with a bullish reversal evident in the 20 DMA.

This is known as providing a customer-centric experience. Examples of adapting technology and focusing on customer-centric experiences are shown through Walmart and Amazon. These businesses traded at $400B (Walmart) and $24B (Amazon) as of 2010. As e-commerce and digital technology grew, the revenue of Walmart grew to $576B and Amazon $477B in March and April 2022. However, as with e-commerce improving traditional business, cryptocurrency and blockchain have the potential to disrupt and revolutionize traditional business by providing unparalleled new customer-centric utility. For example, Binance had revenue of over $20 billion in 2020 and Coinbase $4 billion in 2021. These two exchanges are but two of many, and blockchain also features non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces just as lucrative with OpenSea trading around $2 billion in volume monthly. Despite this success, no traditional business has merged the success of blockchain technology with their business. Therefore here are three ways cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can disrupt traditional business. 1. Customer-centric shopping experience The most substantial success in the e-commerce industry is the ability to cater for the customer, helping them find the perfect product at the best price.

The FATF included firms that handle crypto transactions, known as virtual asset service providers (VASP), within its ambit back in mid-2019. The guidance requires exchanges, trading desks and custodians to transfer personally identifiable information along with crypto transactions over a certain threshold. It has come to be known as the “travel rule.”  Qredo, which raised $80 million in funding earlier this year, is focused on interoperability with other solutions such as TRISA, TRP, TRUST, Sygna, VerifyVASP and Notabene, the custody firm said, while there is also an atomic swap option where both counterparties use Qredo’s multi-party-computation (MPC) custody infrastructure.  Read more: DeFi Infrastructure Provider Qredo Raises $80M at $460M Valuation  The Qredo approach is also useful in the way that it plugs into a range of blockchain analytics tools that many firms will already be familiar with, said Ben Whitby, the firm’s head of compliance. This includes the likes of Chainalysis, Elliptic, TRM Labs, ComplyAdvantage, Coinfirm, VASPNet and Crystal Blockchain.  Whitby said most of the crypto firms Qredo spoke with had spent a good deal of time and money training staff to use blockchain analytics tools of one sort or another. So it made sense to combine trade and compliance work flows with APIs, something that’s particularly useful should the regulator want to probe a given transaction.  “In the event of an investigation from an enforcement agency, you can demonstrate completely that a transaction had the right checks undertaken; a sanctions check, the sending of metadata, and feedback from the beneficiary and so on,” Whitby said in an interview. “It’s all there, instead of having to pull logs and a lot of painful cross-referencing and reconciliation.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/02/crypto-custody-firm-qredo-adds-blockchain-analytics-to-fatf-travel-rule-offering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccf1c7dd4f8104193da371487877b746218d6068-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the end of the day, a casino is simply a business, and like any other business, it is designed to ensure profitability. The reality is, traditional casinos have a slew of built-in advantages to ensure that it always comes out on top, not their customers. This is known as the &apos;house edge&apos; and represents the average gross profit the casino expects to make from each game. The more users play, the greater the odds are that the result of their play will match up with the house edge—and that they will lose money. This house edge vastly varies among the different casino games, with blackjack being the lowest and keno the highest. In 2013, The Wall Street Journal gained access to a private casino database, discovering that only 13.5% of bettors end up winning. Bettors getting taken advantage of by casinos is a culture that unfortunately continues to be the reality for traditional betting. However, the emergence of blockchain technology aims to change this by giving the power back to the user. Players who bet on the blockchain can bet against one another in eSports, regular sports, and other games without going against the house. While emerging metaverse casinos hold a lot of similarities to traditional casinos, there are also some notable differences.

The 24-hour trading volume of Polygon is $450 Million, indicating a drop of 21.84%. Past Performance of MATIC Since the buyers could not hold the value at $1.30, MATIC prices have been under a downward trend. The decline breaks below the $0.78 support level to reach $0.59 and has destroyed over 65% of the total market price within two months. The bullish support of $0.59 helps cushion the downward trend, leading to a lateral shift in the trend and reversing that bearish trendline.

The design of Opensea&apos;s Seaport protocol is to make trading NFTs easier and more accurate. Users will be able to trade ERC20, ERC721, and ETH-based NFTs on OpenSea, rather than just ERC721-based NFTs. With this protocol, users will be able to list offers to trade specific NFTs for a certain amount of ETH instead of NFTs for a certain amount of ETH. Someone could, for example, use Seaport to propose exchanging a Bored Ape for a package containing a CryptoPunk or Cryptoadz token and a small amount of Uniswap&apos;s UNI token. Here&apos;s Why? The Seaport protocol is the future of the NFT marketplace because of the following reasons: Bartering According to OpenSea&apos;s blog post about Seaport, specific trades can be made by assigning each NFT its properties.

42395362,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvyfQ,1654130864,Solana Halted by Bug Linked to Certain Cold Storage Transactions,"The Solana network suffered its latest outage Wednesday, felled for over four hours by a bug in how the blockchain processes a niche type of transaction that’s designed for offline use cases.  Validators began restarting the network only after disabling these “durable nonce transactions,” Solana Labs communications chief Austin Federa told CoinDesk. Those transactions will remain nixed until developers identify and patch the exact culprit that threw Solana’s consensus mechanism off-kilter.  That may have ramifications for offline custodians whose transactions fall under this category, perhaps even freezing their ability to move funds until the patch is in, validators said. CoinDesk has begun reaching out to exchanges to ask about their Solana transaction setup.  Even so, at press time Wednesday a number of exchanges were reporting problems with Solana deposits and withdrawals. Among them: Binance, Coinbase and Crypto.com.  The chain’s native SOL token was already trading lower Wednesday when the outage began around noon Eastern time; it continued its 24-hour slide and was down nearly 13% around 8:30 p.m. ET, trading at $39.98, according to CoinMarketCap.  Durable nonces  Federa said durable nonces represented “an incredibly small percentage” of transactions on Solana until recently. The technology has been growing in popularity among exchanges. In cryptography, a nonce is a random number used for a specific purpose.  “This was probably a bug that existed for a while but never really became an issue because it isn't something that most people use,” Federa said.  Durable nonces on Solana are designed for token holders with complex offline signing setups that can’t always prep their transactions fast enough for the speedy network.  For example, a custodian that signs Solana transactions with two air-gapped computers might not be able to finish the job within a single block. Normal transactions on Solana would fail in this scenario. Durable nonces give the token holder time to work.  What happened on Wednesday was a failure in Solana’s ability to handle durable nonces. Instead of treating these niche inbounds as a single transaction, the network’s validators double-counted them as a single transaction at two different block heights, Federa said. This impossible situation effectively broke Solana’s consensus mechanism.  In a tweet, Laine from Stakewiz, a Solana validator operator, said the bug was “known” and was being fixed prior to Wednesday’s events. It “hadn’t been triggered in this form previously,” Laine said.  The network was slowly coming back to life on Wednesday evening as key infrastructure pieces such as RPC nodes resumed work.",NEGATIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/02/solana-halted-by-bug-linked-to-certain-cold-storage-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a77266875bd5ba03807c057c4d6412491668d63-3622x2717.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Apple&apos;s Augmented Reality (Apple&apos;s AR) will be the first new feature that users have anticipated in seven years. The new headset will combine virtual reality and augmented reality to provide users with an authentic landscape and environment to enjoy. Given the anticipation for the Apple headset, it&apos;s not surprising that people can&apos;t wait for it to be released. Even though Apple AR is another VR headset on the market, the tech titan may have plans for the product in the future. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes Apple will attempt to persuade iPhone owners to purchase VR headsets within the next ten years. Although VR headsets are unlikely to replace smartphones, technological advancements in...",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | AR,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/apples-upcoming-ar-vr-headset-why-the-hype/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=apples-upcoming-ar-vr-headset-why-the-hype,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42395378,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASvyuB,1654128069,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Sinks Below $30K Amid Renewed Risk Fears,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other major cryptos decline.  Insights: South Korea's government is taking a harder look at cryptocurrencies.  Technician's take: Long-term momentum remains negative, capping upside moves in price.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $29,784 -6.2%  Ether (ETH): $1,818 -6.2%  Bitcoin and Other Cryptos Sink  Investors on Wednesday decided that bitcoin wasn't such a good deal after all – or nearly any other major cryptocurrency, for that matter.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just below $30,000, a more than 6% drop over the past 24 hours that relinquished much of the gains posted during a U.S. holiday weekend surge. Bitcoin was changing hands at over $32,000 as recently as Tuesday morning as markets responded to the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in China and the faint possibility that the U.S. central bank might relax its monetary hawkishness much later this year.  All that good faith had faded into the mists by early Wednesday, with investors returning whole hog to the risk-aversiveness that has colored their moves for much of the past eight months. Ether was also down over 7% over the same period, trading at about $1,800. Other major cryptocurrencies sank even deeper with luna classic (LUNC), the new name for the original LUNA on the Terra protocol, falling 61% at one point. SOL and ADA both declined about 12%, while DOT was down roughly 9%.  ""Bitcoin's price action today is not entirely surprising,"" Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull, wrote to CoinDesk. ""Not only is it facing pressure from traditional markets, it has also been struggling to breach the resistance zone between $31K-$32K, resulting in a breakdown from the range it set over the weekend.""  Major stock indexes dropped with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 each closing off 0.7% as investors renewed their concerns about high inflation and the prospect of recession. Gold and the 10-year Treasury yield both rose.  At a business conference Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO, and crypto skeptic, Jamie Dimon told investors and analysts the bank would be conservative with its balance sheet, and to prepare for rough economic times. Dimon said he was worried about central bank quantitative tightening and the continued fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. “Right now, it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the [U.S. Federal Reserve] can handle this,” Dimon said. “That hurricane is right out there, down the road, coming our way.  Bitcoin closed May, a historically strong month, well in the red, although it outpaced altcoins. That reflected investors' preference for the digital asset considered the least risky. Still, BitBull's DiPasquale was skeptical that bitcoin could turn upward quickly. ”Moving forward, bitcoin will need to see significant buying activity and a major sentiment shift for any hopes of a quick reversal,"" he wrote.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,101 -0.7%  DJIA: 32,813 -0.5%  Nasdaq: 11,994 -0.7%  Gold: $1,846 +0.5%  Insights  South Korea has been a hotbed of interest in cryptocurrencies.  That was clear less than three months ago when South Korea's two main presidential candidates were jockeying to see who could appeal to younger voters as the most crypto friendly.  But the country's lawmakers have been taking a harder look at digital assets in recent weeks, particularly after the collapse of the terraUSD stablecoin (UST) and the luna token that supported it. The UST implosion swept up an estimated 280,000 Korean investors.  According to a report on Tuesday by the Korean news outlet NewsPim, the South Korean government will form a Digital Assets Committee, perhaps as early as this month, specifically to oversee the digital assets market in light of the Terra debacle. The committee will provide criteria for the listing of coins by exchanges, introduce investor protections measures and monitor unfair trading.  The initiative followed widespread calls for the establishment of an entity that could function similar to regulatory agencies that protect stock market investors. That responsibility for crypto currently falls to a range of government departments and watchdogs, such as the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Financial Services Commission and the Ministry of Science and ICT (information and communications technology).  Calls for increased oversight of the crypto industry were raised at a National Assembly emergency seminar last week. ""We need to make exchanges play their proper role, and toward that end it is crucial for watchdogs to supervise them thoroughly,"" Rep. Sung Il-jong of the ruling People Power Party said.  How the creation of a crypto-focused committee dovetails with the proposal by Yoon Suk-yeol, the conservative candidate who won the March presidential election, ""to confiscate crypto profits gained through illegitimate means and return them to the victims"" is not clear.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Slips as Relief Bounce Loses Steam, Support at $27K  Bitcoin (BTC) pared earlier gains after buyers took some profits below the $33,000 resistance level. The cryptocurrency could find support, initially at $27,500 and then at $25,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart reached oversold levels on Monday, which preceded the current pullback in price. And on the daily chart, the RSI returned below the 50 neutral mark, indicating a temporary loss in upside momentum.  On the weekly chart, bitcoin appears to be oversold, albeit with negative momentum signals. That suggests upside could be limited beyond $35,000.  For now, BTC is roughly one week away from registering a downside exhaustion signal, which previously occurred on June 7 of last year and on Jan. 10 this year. Still, a weekly close above $30,000 is needed to confirm a bullish short-term signal.  If further breakdowns occur, secondary support is seen at $17,673.

The latest iteration of “hopium” for bitcoiners and crypto natives. When it finally inevitably happens, it’ll be up only for Big Crypto and down only for Big Fiat. But what it actually means is a bit funny. The Decoupling is the moment when bitcoin’s price diverges from equities and starts going up when equities go down (and vice versa). The Decoupling is the moment when bitcoin (BTC) and equities become negatively correlated to each other. Bitcoin will go to $1 million a coin and equities will spiral to zero.""
