42379891,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxZ9,1504652361,Calling the Crypto-Wealthy: Celebrity Baroness Unveils Luxury Bitcoin Condos,"Two high-profile UK entrepreneurs are launching a new luxury apartment complex in Dubai, aiming to cater to those with considerable cryptocurrency holdings.  The ""Aston Crypto Plaza"" is being spearheaded by Baroness Michelle Mone, lingerie designer and member of the UK Parliament, and her partner Doug Barrowmen, a business mogul and founder of private equity firm Aston Ventures.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Mone said that the complex will feature 1,133 luxury apartments spread over 2.4 million square feet, while also sporting a gym and a swimming pool all aimed at ""the amazing blockchain community,"" she added.  As might be expected, the flats aren't cheap, costing between $133,000 and $379,000. The venture is accepting payments in bitcoin, with BitPay serving as payment processor.  ""These property purchases can now happen in minutes from anywhere in the world with the speed of sending an email,"" Stephen Pair, BitPay's CEO, said in an email.  Barrowmen told CoinDesk that he felt the venture was the perfect opportunity for bitcoin investors to convert their holdings into ""real brick-and-mortar"" assets.  Mone – who was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 2010 – further joked that, given her background as the founder of lingerie company Ultimo, she had ""plenty of experience in construction."" The 40-story apartments block was ""nothing compared to the G-cup,"" she laughed.  The apartments will be made available for pre-purchase from their website as of today, and early purchasers will be entered into a raffle to win a free apartment, ""subject to a minimum 50 apartments being sold,"" a press release stated.

42379880,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxNp,1504641615,"BTC-e Is Back Online, But Refund Efforts Are Anything But Smooth","BTC-e announced late last week that it would begin allowing cryptocurrency withdrawals – though it's not clear at this time how many users have gotten their money out since the weekend.  Signs on social media suggest that some users have been able to withdraw their funds. As CoinDesk reported on Friday, BTC-e announced that, if they were willing to accept a plan to accept just over half of their existing holdings in return for so-called debt tokens following a pending relaunch, users could begin taking their money off of the exchange.  Postings on Twitter, as well as the BTC-e chatbox, indicate that a number of customers opted to keep their funds on the exchange itself, under the premise that would presumably recoup all of their money at a later date.  Yet more immediately, social media signs show, many users seem to be having persistent issues in accessing either their accounts or a refund page launched by BTC-e. Some seem to be encountering issues with their accounts being blacklisted from the BTC-e website, while others are reporting problems related to their two-factor authentication (2FA) settings.  Complicating factors are reports that scammers are targeting BTC-e users with phishing attempts. According to one post on Twitter, an email is circulating that directs readers to a fake refund form through which their access credentials can be stolen.  BTC-e was the target of a US crackdown in late July, an event which saw one of its alleged operators arrested and the exchange itself slapped with a $110 million fine from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In the aftermath of that crackdown, representatives for the exchange vowed to relaunch BTC-e after claiming to possess just over half of the funds it originally held.  Notably, BTC-e is reportedly distributing holdings of Bitcoin Cash to users, according to a new tweet, referring to the breakaway cryptocurrency that ""forked"" away from bitcoin at the start of August.  The exchange had received a number of requests related to Bitcoin Cash, a notable development given that the network took shape in the days after BTC-e's original Web domain was seized by law enforcement.

42379893,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxaP,1504634711,Report: Canadian Finance Watchdog Has Concerns Over Blockchain Anonymity,"Canada's financial intelligence agency, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), has concerns over the role of cryptocurrency in crime and policing problems caused by the tech's anonymity, according to a new report.  The Globe and Mail reports that, citing FINTRAC documents and presentations (obtained through a public records request), officials have been saying for some time that the agency needs to develop new technologies to better analyze the financial data produced by the growing adoption of blockchain technologies, which operate under a cryptographic ""veil of anonymity.""  Money laundering is seen as a particular area of concern, and the article points out that Canada's anti-money laundering regime has been criticised by a Canadian Senate committee and the international Financial Action Task Force.  However, FINTRAC indicates that, by analysing cryptocurrency address and other traces, individuals making transactions can to some extent to be profiled.  One of the agency's reports is quoted as saying:  ""Under these systems, users operate pseudo-anonymously, leaving behind various data (e.g. cryptocurrency addresses) that can be used to link a transaction to an individual, particularly where users are not careful to obscure their identity.""  FinTRAC spokesperson Darren Gibb is reported as saying that his agency will respond to the need to address new threats posed by cryptocurrencies.  ""Research may identify the need to cover new entities or administer new reporting requirements to address any emerging money laundering or terrorism financing threats to the Canadian financial system from transactions and entities that are currently not covered,"" he said in an email.

In a recent blog post, the organisation spelled out that it includes the cryptocurrency on its balance sheets – alongside other means of donation, including zcash – ""to be a living example of an organization that is trying this innovative internet technology.""  The post continued:  ""The Internet Archive explores how bitcoin and other internet innovations can be useful in the non-profit sphere – this is part of it. We want to see how donated bitcoin can be used, not just sold off. We are doing this publicly so others can learn from us. And it is fun. And it is interesting.""  As a nonprofit, the archive has been accepting bitcoin donations since 2012, and has offered the digital asset as a salary option to employees since 2013. Local businesses around the Internet Archive office have also been encouraged to accept the currency – sometimes with success.  Rather than immediately exchange its bitcoin donations for fiat currency, however, the Internet Archive attempts to find ways to use them.

42379854,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxGH,1504625731,Russia's Central Bank Issues Warning on Cryptocurrencies and ICOs,"Russia's central bank has issued a new statement on the risks of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs).  The Bank of Russia, according to a notice published yesterday, appears to be responding to the rising media profile of both ICOs – through which blockchain-based cryptographic tokens are sold in a crowdsale – as well as cryptocurrencies themselves within Russia. Indeed, even an aide to Russian president Vladimir Putin has said he is moving to hold an ICO of his own.  The statement notes the ""high risks"" of exchanging cryptocurrencies, as well as participation in ICOs (described as ""a form of attracting citizens' investments"").  The central bank went on to say that, at this stage, it won't greenlight any cryptocurrency trading on any official exchanges, nor would it approve the use of the tech for infrastructure purposes. At the same time, the Bank of Russia doesn't serve as a financial regulator in Russia; that role falls to the State Duma and the Ministry of Finance.  The Bank of Russia said (in a translated statement):  ""Given the high risks of circulation and use of crypto-currency, the Bank of Russia considers it premature to admit crypto-currencies, as well as any financial instruments nominated or associated with crypto-currencies, to circulation and use at organized trades and in clearing and settlement infrastructure on the territory of the Russian Federation for servicing transactions with crypto-currencies and derivative financial instruments on them.""  The statements come on the heels of China's move to ban ICOs and more tightly control the ecosystem of exchanges offering access to those token sales. As CoinDesk previously reported, China-based ICOINFO froze its platform last week ahead of the news, and is scheduled to begin returning money to users this weekend.  This morning, Hong Kong's chief securities regulators issued a warning of their own on ICOs, remarking that some tokens may constitute securities – echoing statements issued by officials in Singapore, Canada and the US in recent weeks.

42379897,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxeB,1504620304,Heading Up? Ether Prices Consolidate After China's ICO Crackdown,"The ether-US dollar exchange rate (ETH/USD) nosedived on Monday after reports hit the wires that China has officially banned ICOs. Other digital currencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and others were dragged lower as well.  It's a notable development for the industry – the world’s number two cryptocurrency is up more than 3,000 percent on the year, and the dramatic rally has triggered not only mainstream attention, but fears that ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain, has grown too fast.  Yet, having clocked a fresh three-week low of $270 levels earlier today, ether is now trading at roughly $305.  This means ether is down 12.85% week-over-week, although, on a month-on-month basis the digital currency is holding 16.76% gains. So, on a larger scheme of things, the trend remains bullish.  China's ICO crackdown – Just the beginning?  Still, the China news has been particularly impactful on price as ICO issuers often request payment in ether. (Most ICO tokens are ethereum smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain, which further explains the big drop in the cryptocurrency.)  And there could be more headwinds ahead.  A report from Chinese financial news outlet Yicai indicates that the ban on ICOs could be followed by further action, as it hinted that regulatory authorities intend to tighten the noose further around the cryptocurrency space.  However, the ETH/USD pair has recovered from the three-week low of $270, which suggests investors are not very concerned about the threat of further regulations.  So is the sell-off over for now? Let us see what the price chart has to say…  Bearish exhaustion seen below around trend line support  Sellers appear to have run out of steam (bearish exhaustion) near the key rising trend line support seen on the chart below.  As perCoinMarketCap, the price of ether is up 5% in the last 24 hours. The market capitalization has dropped to $27.90 billion from the previous day’s figure of $32.77 billion. That amounts to a 14.86% drop in a single day.  ETH/USD daily chart  ETH/USD 1-hour chart  The bullish price RSI divergence seen on the chart above shows the sell-off may have ended at the three-week low of $270. (A bullish price RSI divergence is formed when prices form higher highs while the oscillator – in this case an RSI – forms significantly lower highs.)  The falling trend line on the chart above is likely to act as a resistance around $330 levels.  Bias  A corrective rally to $320-330 levels could be seen.  Only a positive close today and a bullish follow-through tomorrow would signal the sell-off has ended.  Selling is seen gathering pace if the prices dip below the three-week low set below $270 levels.  Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

42379879,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KxMZ,1504616406,China's ICO Ban: A Full Translation of Regulator Remarks,"The following is a full translation of statements by China's financial regulators outlining a recent ban on initial coin offerings.      Recently, a number of token fundraising activities in the country, including initial coin offerings, have emerged for the purposes of financing and speculation. Such [sales] are considered illegal and disruptive to economic and financial stability.  In order to be compliant with the messages conveyed during the National Financial Work Conference, to protect the legal rights of investors and to prevent financial risks, we have the following announcement.  The statement is based on the law of the People's Republic of China, as well as the laws of the People's Bank of China, commercial banking and securities law, cybersecurity and telecommunications law, and financing and financial activities law.  1. An accurate acknowledgement of the nature of ICOs  ""Token fundraising"" refers to a process where fundraisers distribute digital tokens to investors who make financial contributions in the form of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether.  By nature, it is an unauthorized and illegal public financing activity, which involves financial crimes such as the illegal distribution of financial tokens, the illegal issuance of securities and illegal fundraising, financial fraud and pyramid scheme.  Relevant authorities will closely monitor the latest market status and collaborate with the justice department and local governments.  Altogether, they will strictly enforce the current legal framework to solve the market chaos. Any criminal suspicion will be handed over to the justice department.  The tokens or ""cryptocurrencies"" that are distributed during the token fundraising are not issued by the monetary authority, which has no legal property as fiat currency does and cannot circulate in the monetary market.  Any organization or individual is prohibited from starting illegal token fundraising activity  Starting from the date of this announcement, all kinds of fundraising activities through token issuance should stop immediately.  Organizations and individuals who have completed token fundraising previously shall make arrangements such as refunding crypto assets to investors to protect investor rights, and to deal with the risks properly.  Relevant law enforcements will investigate and severely punish those who refuse to halt fundraising activities through token issuance and those whose completed token fundraising activates are found to have violated the law or regulation.  Reinforce the supervision on platforms that provide exchange services for tokens issued during the fund raising  Starting from the date of this announcement, any so-called token exchange platform shall not:  Be involved in offering exchange services between fiat currency and tokens  Buy or sell tokens for cryptocurrencies, or act as a central party facilitating the trading of tokens for cryptocurrencies  Provide price bidding or middleman service for the exchange of tokens for cryptocurrency.  For any token exchange platform that violates the law or regulation, financial authorities will request:  The telecommunication department to shut down its website and mobile application.  The Cyberspace Administration of China to delist its mobile application from app stores.  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce to discard its business license.  No financial institutions or non-banking payment institutions shall operate businesses that deal with token fundraising  All financial institutions and non-banking payment institutions shall not directly or indirectly provide account opening, registration, trading, clearing and settlement services for token fundraising activities; shall not underwrite any insurance policy that relates to tokens and cryptocurrency, or include any token and cryptocurrency under the insurance policy coverage.  Should any financial institution and non-banking payment institution be found in violation of the law or regulation, they should be reported to relevant authorities immediately. The public should be highly vigilant about potential risks that come with token fundraising and trading.  Token fund raising and trading pose multiple risks, including fraudulent assets, business operational failure, and speculation, etc. Investors are responsible for taking such risks themselves and thus are advised to remain cautious on suspicious projects.  For any illegal financing activity that operates under the name of ""coin,"" the public should become better at spotting scams and always stay vigilant against risks, and should report to the authority any lead of law and regulation violation.  Industry Organizations Should be Self-disciplined.  Different financial industry organizations should study the regulation well and have member companies to voluntarily fight against any illegal financial activity that relates to token and cryptocurrency fund raising; should stay away from this market chaos; should improve the education for investors; and jointly maintain the financial stability.

42400344,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNRi,1504609202,Legitimate? IRS Defends Coinbase Customer Investigation in Court Filing,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has filed new court documents in its long-running lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange startup Coinbase, public records show.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the IRS is seeking to identify potential tax avoiders, years after it first moved to begin taxing bitcoin as a kind of intangible property.  The tax agency had been given a September 1 deadline to issue its arguments in support of a narrowed summons for customer information between the years 2013 and 2015, and has submitted multiple filings, according to PACER. These include responses to outside advocacy groups that have moved to block the court effort with arguments of their own.  In response to Coinbase's petition to block the summons, the agency attacked the notion that it was looking to enforce it ""for research or public relations reasons,"" calling the summons part of a ""legitimate"" investigation.  Lawyers for the agency wrote:  ""The IRS sought and issued the summons to Coinbase because it suspects there is a tax compliance problem with U.S. taxpayers using virtual currency and it is duty-bound to investigate issues of tax non-compliance − not for research or any public relations purpose. Nevertheless, the summons is not made unenforceable because the IRS will benefit from the additional educational aspect of the summons and any research it may yield.""  Elsewhere in the document, the IRS reiterates a key argument made earlier this year, stating that it believes Coinbase could have information regarding potential tax avoiders.  ""The United States has offered evidence that, based upon the information available to the IRS there appears to be a reporting gap between the number of virtual currency users Coinbase claims to have had during the summons period (500,000) and U.S. bitcoin users reporting gains or losses to the IRS during the summoned years (807, 893, and 802),"" the filing states.

42400349,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNXc,1504605628,Utility Coins or Crypto Assets? Token Terminology Is One Big Gray Area,"It's been an extreme few months in the world of cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin  and other crypto assets have hit all-time highs, new cryptocurrencies have been announced and sold, and a wave of new token funds have launched.  If you're looking to put more money to work in the token space, another thing that you've probably noticed is an explosion in the names used to define the different types: app tokens, utility tokens, security tokens...  What's the difference and why does what a token is called matter so much?  The short answer – as with any investment – is that what you don't know can cause you to lose money.  A new risk  In late July, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) weighed in on a token issued by a Swiss-based foundation called The DAO. For those who weren't following the decision closely, here's what happened: the SEC found the project had run afoul of U.S. securities law.  A key point here: The DAO token collapsed before the SEC issued its guidance.  But what if it hadn't? If the DAO token had still been freely trading at the time the SEC issued its guidance, it's reasonable to wonder what the price impact might have been. Would the price of the token have tanked?  That's a difficult question to answer precisely, because there's been no precedent in the token space to date. (Though recent moves by China's regulators may give us real-world insight).  From here, things get more complicated.  Since The DAO ruling was issued, participants in the token space have increasingly sought to find ways to distinguish between tokens that would qualify as securities and those that are not securities.  The legal view  Recently, terms like ""app coin,"" ""app token,"" ""utility token"" and ""utility coin"" have seemed to proliferate. But, what they all have in common is this: people use them interchangeably to mean ""a token that is not a security.""  Joshua Ashley Klayman, who leads the Blockchain + Smart Contracts group at law firm Morrison & Foerster, said that there is no clear, bright-line guidance under the law on the distinction between the terms utility token, app token and security token.  According to Klayman, that leaves potential buyers and sellers of tokens in a tremendous gray area, since they are all effectively stuck in the position of trying to figure out how much any given token resembles a security.  ""Most responsible securities lawyers would have said that The DAO token was highly likely to be a security,"" she said. ""When people ask about app tokens, it's because they want to get out of the securities space. They don't want to be constrained by securities requirements.""  Even though The DAO token was issued by a foundation in Switzerland, U.S. securities laws still apply because U.S. investors were purchasers of the token.  One way that people attempt to determine if something is a security token, according to Klayman, is based on whether the token has utility on day one.  She elaborated:  ""If you think about it in terms of a video game arcade, at some arcades you can just put quarters in the machine. In others, you have to put tokens in the machine. So users have to buy the token to transact within the ecosystem. The idea is that people really want to use the product or service that the company is offering, and that the token is the only way to access it.""  The VC view  Greg Murphy, a Toronto-based partner at the U.K. venture capital firm Outlier Ventures, which focuses on investing in blockchain and related technologies, also assists its portfolio companies with token issuance.  When asked to comment on the utility token/security token divide, Murphy acknowledged similar challenges.  ""Everybody is struggling with the definition. And there really isn't a good one,"" he said.  Murphy went on to add that there is no direct jurisprudence on the matter and, hence, you're at the mercy of your legal counsel's view at the time you create the token – and that can alter as the regulations change.  Because of the shifting sands, Murphy said, ""You have to ask yourself: Do you really want to take on potential liability if there is the chance of it being deemed a security in the future?""  The innovator view  And even those closest to the technology agree.  While Rune Christensen, founder of MakerDao – a decentralized autonomous organization working to build stable digital currencies – might be the first person you'd expect to have firm definitions, he doesn't.  Yet, Christensen believes that ensuring solid distinctions between concepts like utility tokens and app tokens is critical for the success of the sector.  Asked to elaborate, Christensen was blunt about what he sees as the challenges now facing the space:  ""The majority of ICOs that are happening now are in fact securities and should follow the standard process for securities offerings. They are fooling naive investors into believing that they are buying a piece of decentralized infrastructure when, in fact, they are only buying the promises of the management team.""  Christensen went on to explain that, from the perspective of token makers, it's absolutely critical that the crackdown on token-based, unregulated securities offerings should not interfere with the kind of projects that are truly decentralized.  ""It could be really destructive for innovation if the wrong tokens are deemed to be securities when they are not,"" he stressed.  As for how investors will be able to tell which ones are which? If Christensen's answers are any indication, that's likely to be a question that challenges risk appetites for some time.

42400353,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNZa,1504602010,Proof of Xerox? Copier Giant Pursues Blockchain Time-Stamping Strategy,"A technology company best known for its eponymous copier machines may be looking to use blockchain to create digital proofs for documents and other forms of data.  Just last week, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published a new patent filed by Xerox in which it outlines a method by which a blockchain (either a public option or a permissioned alternative) could be used to tie types of data (naming images and video as examples) to a certain period in time.  After detailing the use of the bitcoin blockchain for time-stamping purposes – mentioning the Proof of Existence project by name, the application goes on to state:  ""According to an aspect of the embodiments of the present invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus comprising: an acquisition unit that acquires feature information of a latest block in a block chain when target data is generated; and a registration unit that registers proof information indicating that the generated target data is correlated with the feature information acquired by the acquisition unit when the target data is generated to a time proof service.""  Interestingly, the filing shares a name with another Xerox patent application submitted in 2015, though the text of that application makes no reference to blockchain.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Xerox has already submitted at least two other blockchain-related patents, both of which hinted at the use of the tech for a record-keeping system.

42400347,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNWd,1504598415,Brazil's Central Bank Considers Blockchain Settlement Prototype,"Brazil's central bank has released a new research paper that details possible use cases for blockchains and distributed ledgers while outlining how various available platforms could be used to test the technology.  The result of a study group initiated by Banco Central do Brasil and published August 28, the report looks at use cases for DLT including identity, local currency and settlement – though, just the latter was ultimately recommended for prototyping.  The objective, however, is not to design a primary settlement platform for the central bank, but to create a ""minimal"" backup system for funds transfer in the event of a ""complete main [settlement system] meltdown.""  The report states:  ""In the case of its catastrophic failure, RTGS members would be unable to send (or receive) funds to (from) each other, leading to a complete financial halt. ... In this context, the Alternative System for Transactions Settlement (SALT) is a conceptual system for a contingent solution that would be able to immediately replace core functionalities of the main Brazilian RTGS in case of its full collapse.""  The authors indicate that the design of this system includes a permissioned blockchain network in which financial institutions and the central bank itself are the validating nodes.  They study concludes that, although privacy is a potential issue, DLT ""could make possible to create a unique shared view of a large variety of information fed and replicated across institutions.""  In this way, the paper is in line with studies commissioned by other global central banks.  The Bank of England and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, for example, have examined how blockchain could be applied to settlement, though the UK central bank has perhaps gone the farthest to date, reporting its newest settlement system will be ""distributed ledger compatible.""

42400351,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNaZ,1504584603,Uncertainty Lingers In China as ICO Exchanges Begin Customer Refunds,"""The longest day.""  That's how James Gong, founder of ICOage, described Monday, the day on which seven China-based regulators took sweeping action against domestic initial coin offerings (ICOs), the nascent funding mechanism his startup was founded to enable.  In a broad series of releases unrivaled so far globally, China's regulators took aim at all aspects of the market, calling on exchanges cease the trading of ICO tokens and demanding that platforms issue refunds to select customers.  At the request of regulators, ICOage moved to suspend its operations, and it is now refunding only customers who have made purchases but who have yet to receive the tokens. Gong said refunds were now taking place in bitcoin and ether, the cryptocurrency for ethereum, the platform on which most ICOs have been based.  At press time, it seems other domestic websites are following suit.  ICOINFO, another China-based ICO gateway, announced on its website that it has refunded customers who participated in four token sales. Other refunds, it said, are set to begin later this week.  According to local traders, such sites had previously been hotbeds for regional ICO activity, with projects routinely raising between 3,000 to 5,000 BTC via token sales.  Mixed reactions  But while markets were down on the news, not everyone was apt to read the actions against ICOs as a negative.  Chen Weixing, an ICO investor and the former founder of transportation startup Kuaidi Dache, for example, sought to stress the global nature of blockchain, as well as the trials and tribulations of his own startup as reasons for downplaying the news.  ""Many times the government announced we were illegal,"" Weixing said of his one-time ride-sharing startup. (His firm later merged with competitor Didi in 2015).  Weixing went on to talk broadly about the nature of technology and how government attempts to stop innovation generally proves to be a losing strategy.  Asked about the long-term impact, one local exchange operator hinted that it remains to be seen whether China can successfully crack down on ICOs given it was unable to halt domestic bitcoin trading despite severe restrictions.  However, the executive suggested the centralized nature of ICO fundraising could be a point of failure that makes it more susceptible to regulation.  For now, though, it seems time will need to provide clarity to such questions, with even ICO platforms suggesting they were awaiting further guidance on whether they might be able to proceed with their business in any capacity.  Gong concluded:  ""We just waiting for regulators more instructions. If they want to close all ICO platforms, we don't have another choice.""

42400338,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNPk,1504578627,"Bitcoin's Price Is Now Down 20% from Its $5,000 All-Time High","Bitcoin appears to be moving into a new period of price discovery.  Following a new ruling that finds China's regulators moving to outlaw initial coin offerings (sales of new cryptographic tokens often exchanged for bitcoin), the bitcoin price fell to its lowest total since August 22 today.  At press time, bitcoin had declined to just above $4,000 – halting at $4,037.50 across global exchanges – a 20% decline from its all-time high of $5,013 observed on September 1.  Of the exchanges tracked in the BPI, just one was trading below $4,000 at the time of the report, with China-based OKCoin displaying a $3,969 price. (Paxos's itBit exchange, Coinbase's GDAX exchange and Bitstamp were all trading above $4,000).  Still, as reported by CoinDesk, the move below $4,100 on most major exchanges could be significant, potentially foretelling a bigger move down to $3,769 should the price obey Fibonacci patterns.  The drop comes at a time when the total value of all publicly issued cryptocurrencies has seen a similar decline, dropping from a high of $179 billion to $145 billion today.  In total, the market is now down nearly 19 percent from its all-time high.  Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.
