42404466,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLGV,1586905283,"Chinese DeFi Platform dForce Raises $1.5M From Multicoin, Huobi Capital","One of China’s largest decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms has raised fresh capital for expanding its product lineup.      Announced Tuesday, the dForce Foundation has completed a $1.5 million seed round led by Multicoin Capital and joined by Huobi Capital and CMB International (CMBI). The foundation plans on earmarking the funds for staffing and new DeFi product launches in 2020, according to a statement.      The foundation maintains two protocols, lending platform Lendf and synthetic fiat stablecoin USDx.      dForce founder Mindao Yang told CoinDesk the firm, which launched in 2019, will use the funds to continue stepping outside the stablecoin game and into the larger DeFi movement. Part of that vision includes Lendf, the lending platform dForce launched in September 2019.      Yang said Lendf has become the largest protocol in China for lending fiat-backed stablecoins, such as USDC or USDT, regardless of its smaller share of the DeFi market. DeFi Pulse lists dForce as the seventh-largest DeFi market by value locked.      Indeed, the lending protocol currently has more fiat-backed stablecoins out for borrow than both Compound and Aave – ranked third and fourth in terms of market share – with some $8.5 million in loans compared to $5 million and $7 million, respectively.    Big in China    Yang said most DeFi protocols have been built in Western markets for Western customers, giving the dForce protocol elbow room in China. The new capital will help the firm build on this lead in the DeFi sector, Yang said.      “It's quite a full stack that we can service in China,” Yang said. “This market is very different than the Western markets where the majority of the DeFi protocols are targeted.”      The slight edge may also have ties to what assets are being lent on Lendf, particularly USDT. Tether is by far the largest stablecoin by market cap with some $7 billion assets on-chain as of press time, according to Messari.      Compound does not offer lending for USDT while Aave only added the token last month. USDC remaining the predominant stablecoin lent on both networks. Meanwhile, USDT makes up almost 80 percent of lent assets on Lendf. There’s only a total of $2.7 million USDx assets currently in circulation, according to Etherscan.      It's the second dForce round for CMBI, the investment arm of the fifth-largest bank in China, after solely leading the startup's prior round. CMBI also recently participated in a $5.7 million token sale for the Nervos Network.      dForce’s Yang said the foundation has fostered a long-term relationship with the bank, which is known to invest in the emerging tech sector.      Yang said the investment was notable in that CMBI was “probably one of the only [Chinese] banking groups that invested publicly” in a DeFi application to date.      UPDATE (April 12, 14:45 UTC): A previous version of this article said Aave did not list USDT.

42404479,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLSJ,1586898077,Bitcoin Tests $7K as Spot Trading Volumes Subside to Normal Levels,"After weeks of elevated activity, trading volumes on spot bitcoin exchanges have subsided, boding well for some traders if not the venues themselves.      Prices for bitcoin (BTC) climbed less than a percent Tuesday, retracing gains lost the day before when it hit a one-week low, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The price of the bellwether cryptocurrency is above the 10-day moving average on hourly charts, a bullish signal as bitcoin tries to climb back to $7,000 levels.      Bitcoin has been gaining price momentum since 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. EDT), jumping from the $6,800 area, closely touching the $7,000 level, but currently changing hands around $6,900.      This rise comes a day after large, futures liquidation-based sell-offs of $29 million caused prices to slump in early hours trading around 00:00 UTC Monday.      “Yesterday’s drop seemed pretty manipulated but, as we’ve said before, these moves are more likely now as the liquidity has dried up significantly,” said Jack Tan, founding partner at Taiwan crypto trading firm Kronos Research.      Read more: Options Market Signals Doubt Bitcoin Price Will Rise After Halving      Indeed, bitcoin volumes on USD/BTC exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitstamp have subsided to February levels after enjoying elevated volume in March when a massive sell-off occurred because of coronavirus-related fears. At one point, the price for 1 BTC dipped below $4,000 briefly during heavy trading action on March 12.      Depending on trading strategies, this lower-volume environment can prove beneficial for some market participants. Lower volume means thinner liquidity and can cause prices to swing more often.       “Our options strategies have been outperforming significantly given the crazy vol[atility] environment,” said Darius Sit, managing partner at QCP Capital. The options market is sending bearish signals ahead of bitcoin’s upcoming halving, giving traders like QCP clear indication how to trade in a lower volume spot market.      Despite exchanges reporting interest in bitcoin is increasing, volumes certainly are not, said Vishal Shah, an options trader building a new crypto derivatives exchange called Alpha5.      “Outside anecdotal claims by certain on-ramps that they're seeing great inbound interest, the trade volume isn't indicating it, and I don't necessarily expect this to change on the other side of the halving, without any additional catalysts,” said Shah.      Of course, it’s possible new users are holding their bitcoin rather than actively trading it, or they are buying from exchanges and then trading on a peer-to-peer basis. And to the degree these converts are individuals rather than hedge funds or the like, their trades are less likely to move the needle on exchange volumes.    Other markets    Major digital assets are mixed on CoinDesk’s board for the day. Ether (ETH) jumped 2 percent.      Other big gainers include lisk (LSK) flashing green at 4 percent, monero (XMR), up 2 percent and ethereum classic (ETC) up 1 percent. Losers include dogecoin (DOGE) in the red 1 percent and XRP (XRP) down a percent. All price changes are from 20:45 UTC (4:45 PM EDT in New York) Tuesday.      Elsewhere, gold, the precious metal crypto traders follow closely, maintained its classic haven asset status through tumultuous times, currently trading up less than 1 percent. It’s been trading above its 10-day moving average since April 9, a long bullish trend for the yellow metal.      “Gold finally broke the $1,700 resistance point. We’re seeing sustained demand due to the continued rise of the number of COVID-19 cases globally,” said Nemo Qin, analyst at multi-asset brokerage eToro. “Consumer spending and gold production begins to resume in China, which will support gold prices in the short term.”      Gold’s consistent price gain is how cryptocurrency enthusiasts were expecting bitcoin to behave but that’s not happening, and pessimistic views abound on bitcoin’s halving in May.      “Most people want to believe the halving will create a big upward move, but still feels like bears or a few big whales are going to squeeze us lower first,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      In traditional markets, the Nikkei 225 climbed by 3 percent as analysts said a massive short squeeze pushed the Tokyo-based markets higher. The FTSE 100 European index ended the day up less than 1 percent, coming on the heels of Britain’s Office for Budget Responsibility indicating the U.K. economy could contract by 35 percent.

Announced Tuesday, the grant money will be doled out to companies and developers building out Algorand’s proof-of-stake blockchain over the next two to four years, according to Head of Operations Fangfang Chen. Projects focused on research and development, dapps, education and “community initiatives” are eligible for grants.      The program marks Algorand’s most substantial community investment to date. A previous grant program unveiled last November pledged anywhere from 5,000 to 250,000 ALGO per six-month project, but that upper bound was “the maximum award” the Foundation said it would allow. Those figures are dwarfed by this new program’s first allocation: six million ALGO split three ways.      The Foundation selected projects by Bloq, PureStake and Reach for the first round of grants. Chen declined to state the allotments breakdown, saying only that grants are “tailored to each project need.”      Bloq is developing multi-chain infrastructure while PureStake is building the “AlgoSigner” browser plug-in. Reach, a dapp development assistance platform, is retrofitting its compiler for Algorand, said founder Chis Swenor.      Swenor said Reach's eventual integration will lower the barriers to entry on Algorand. His platform caters to first-time dapp developers who lack the experience and deep pockets of ""blockchain experts.""      Reach makes dapp coding ""safe for all developers, not just teams of blockchain experts with an abundance of funds they can throw at auditing,"" he said. ""We are helping Algorand reach all developers in the world and not just the blockchain experts.""      Derek Yoo, PureStake’s chief executive, told CoinDesk that AlgoSign ""will let developers build Algorand transaction capabilities into their applications, much like the MetaMask plugin does on the Ethereum network.""      He said the funding will cover development and the first year of maintenance and upgrades.      The Algorand Foundation controls the program’s selection and evaluation processes at launch, but that may change in 2021, when Chen said it may shift decision making over to the community.",POSITIVE,ALGO,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/14/algorand-foundation-sets-aside-50m-in-tokens-to-spur-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fccb7423b456557516cfd90e85208c81ff5184e-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""For the first time since the Great Depression both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies are in recession,"" Gita Gopinath, International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief economist, said. The crypto industry is far from insulated, today major Bitcoin miner manufacturer Bitmain announced it will pay rebates to customers hit by the market downturn, while an aspiring crypto exchange has folded.      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      To combat the spread of the virus, technologists are working fervently to develop contact tracing tools to monitor how the virus moves through communities, often sacrificing cherished principles like privacy and autonomy. Here's the story:    Top Shelf    The Great Lockdown    “The Great Lockdown is the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis [of 2008],” International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief economist Gita Gopinath said on Tuesday. She projected the global economy will contract by 3 percent in 2020, due to $9 trillion in losses. The United States is expected to decline to roughly -6 percent growth, as are other nations in the advanced economy group. Gopinath said this year’s losses will “dwarf” the global financial crisis 12 years ago.  A second wave of job loss is hitting businesses that were once thought to be resilient to shelter-in-place mandates, according to the Wall Street Journal. These include workers in the intellectual economy, including corporate lawyers, government bureaucrats, and healthcare workers not engaged in fighting the pandemic. “The longer shutdowns continue, the bigger this second wave could become, risking a repeat of the deep and prolonged labor downturn that accompanied the 2007-09 recession,” according to the Journal.  The bitcoin-friendly company behind Cash App, Square, announced Monday it is participating in the U.S. government’s emergency Paycheck Protection Program. Jackie Reses, head of Square Capital, tweeted that Square will work with Salt Lake City-based Celtic Bank to roll out the lending program this week.    Contact Tracing    Google and Apple will bake their jointly produced decentralized tracing tool, meant to track COVID-19 contagion, into their operating systems. TechCrunch’s Zack Whittaker and Darrell break down what data will be collected, where it will be stored, and who will have access. An absolute must read.  “But contact tracing in the real world is not quite as many of the academic and industry proposals assume,” writes Ross Anderson for Light Blue Touchpaper, a University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory blog. While the morality of contact tracing has been getting a lot of play, the efficacy of monitoring global, mobile populations isn’t yet fully understood. Decentralized systems are difficult to update, people will naturally resist downloading an app, and the information collected may be insufficient or misleading, Anderson argues.  Still, there are paths to boosting public health without invading civil liberties, and a European consortium is forging the way. The Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, is putting together a variety of different proposals for contact tracing, including the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing that offers a model for protecting privacy while carrying out necessary disease surveillance. This includes how to keep users’ Bluetooth IDs truly anonymous, how to secure the upload of Bluetooth data to servers, and what a decentralized, open system approach might look like.    Zoom Boom?    Your Zoom account information is worth less than a penny on the dark web. Cybersecurity intelligence firm Cyble told BleepingComputer that more than 500,000 Zoom accounts are being auctioned on the dark net and hacker forums, and sometimes given away for free.

42404459,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLCZ,1586883652,MakerDAO Users Sue Stablecoin Issuer Following 'Black Thursday' Losses,"A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the Maker Foundation on behalf of investors who lost funds following a protocol failure on March 12, or Black Thursday.      The suit, which could represent up to 3,000 investors, was filed in the Northern District Court of California by lead plaintiff Peter Johnson represented by Harris Berne Christensen LLP of Portland, Ore.      The suit alleges the Maker Foundation and associated parties – including the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation, the Dai Foundation and the Maker Foundation – “intentionally misrepresented the risks associated with CDP ownership” resulting in the loss of $8.325 million in investors’ money on Black Thursday.      Johnson has filed three counts including negligence, intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation.      Last Thursday, the Maker Foundation told CoinDesk it was aware of the lawsuit and “would address all questions as directly as possible.”      In a statement Tuesday, the firm said, “The Maker Foundation has no comment with respect to any planned or pending legal actions.”      After a discovery period, Johnson expects to have 1,000 members join the suit seeking payments equivalent to each investor's lost funds of no less than $8.325 million, plus the cost of punitive damages weighed at $20 million, interest and additional costs.      As reported by CoinDesk, a sharp drop in the price of ether – the primary digital asset used as collateral in the MakerDAO protocol for collateralizing loans of the dollar-pegged dai stablecoin – created underlying congestion on the Ethereum blockchain while also liquidating thousands of collateralized debt positions (CDPs) held by investors.      Johnson claims auctioned collateral was advertised to be returned to users after a 13 percent haircut. Instead, many positions were fully or nearly fully liquidated.      That 13 percent is not a hard line but dependent on internal conditions in the ecosystem, according to the project’s white paper. Johnson claims various Maker products, including the commonly used decentralized application (dapp) Oasis, claims a 13 percent penalty is the highest strike for liquidation.      The suit also specifically cites Maker’s recent education efforts with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to attract CDP holders.      “The Maker Foundation and other third-party user interfaces informed users that, because their CDPs would be significantly overcollateralized, liquidation events would only result in a 13 [percent] liquidation penalty applied against the remaining collateral, after which the remaining collateral would be returned to the user,” the suit alleges.      Johnson claims the Maker Foundation’s actions were “intentional and fraudulent,” leading to the personal loss of $200,000 in ETH after investing in a product that falsely advertised the risks of opening a CDP position.    Maker’s response    Meanwhile, the Maker community itself is collaborating on partial compensation for users who suffered from MakerDAO’s architectural flaws.    A governance pollhttps://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwfvvguaf8rz8xwgv2cqnzzt9t5h6epzh17qmk2ue99y4 among holders of the MKR governance token passed an initial vote on April 13 to refund investors who were liquidated unfairly in mid-March.    The dynamics of the refund, such as what currency the investors will be paid back in and to what amount, are being constructed in another governance poll that has yet to go live. If successful, that poll will lead to a final executive governance vote.      One part was readily agreed on before other details, however: an indemnity clause protecting the Maker Foundation.      “To withdraw, vault holders will need to browse to a web page where they agree to indemnify Maker and affiliates against any potential legal claims for their loss,” the poll states.      How a decentralized community of investors can create a legal document on behalf of a Foundation supporting their protocol remains unclear, even to the Maker Foundation.      “What team has validated the legalities of an indemnity clause? For what jurisdictions will it be valid?” Maker Foundation community manager Rich Brown said in a governance poll forum.      Preston Byrne, attorney at Anderson Kill LLP, told CoinDesk in an email the language “is not certain enough to constitute a binding contract” and that a “CDP holder who suffered losses, did not vote on the poll, and did not accept the proposed haircut would almost certainly not be bound by that indemnity term.”      Johnson said he was aware of the compensation vote before filing, but said he was skeptical of an outcome that truly compensated victims. In a public message on Telegram, he said the Foundation is “trying to avoid a lawsuit by backpedaling” and that “there's already so much evidence that they committed gross negligence, and possibly fraud.”      Read the class-action lawsuit below:",NEGATIVE,ETH | MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MKR | REGULATION,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/14/makerdao-users-sue-stablecoin-issuer-following-black-thursday-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47303a42170fbc31727d93c0d2836cccef90e37a-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404464,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLIT,1586881685,Filipino Pawnshops Bank on Crypto Remittances During Crisis,"Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.      After reading my last op-ed for CoinDesk, my friend Miguel Cuneta used Rebit to send me enough “pity bitcoin” to buy a bottle of wine, if and when the local liquor ban is lifted.      Rebit – that is, Bitcoin-remittance or ""Rebittance"" – is a service that lets you send money from anywhere in the world to anyone in the Philippines using Bitcoin. Created in 2014 by Satoshi Citadel Industries (SCI), the company that Miguel co-founded, Rebit works so bitcoin turns up as Philippine pesos at one of Rebit’s cash pick up centers. With more than 10,000 partnering payout locations across the nation, it’s easy to grab your cash no matter where you are across the sprawling Philippine archipelago of over 7,400 islands. In my case, I went to collect from my local pawnshop, Cebuana Lhuillier.      Over here, pawnshops do a lot more than just pawn valuables. In a country where almost 90 percent of adults do not have a bank account, and international remittances make up 11 percent of GDP, pawnshops go the last mile for millions of unbanked people who still need to send and receive money. At the pawnshop, you can also pay bills, purchase microinsurance or borrow cash. In the case of the latter, despite a notoriously bad rep for dishing out predatory loans and high interest rates, an emergency loan from the pawnshop could be a lifeline for someone without access to traditional credit.      See also: Leah Callon-Butler - Letter from the Philippines: Life During Coronavirus      But dealing with pawnshops is super inefficient. To redeem my 500 PHP (about $10), I had to wait outside the shop in the sticky humidity for over an hour, and in total, I had to fill out three different paper forms. The first was handed to me while I was outside, sweating profusely. Then, as I progressed into the upper echelons of the air conditioned indoor queue, I received another form. And then a third, when I finally arrived at the teller desk and we got into the actual cash out process. Each form was requesting fairly similar info so I don’t see why I had to supply it over and over again. At least it gave me something to do.      Paper-based systems built on bricks-and-mortar are a drag at the best of times, but the COVID-19 situation is making it worse. In addition to the long wait times, and as a result of the Enhanced Community Quarantine, some pawnshops are reducing their operating hours or closing altogether – even though they are classed as essential services. Same goes for other physical outlets offering cash-in-and-out services, like 7-11 and shopping mall kiosks. On top of that, some people are physically unable to travel to the outlet, since public transport has been suspended and military-guarded checkpoints are restricting the movement of private vehicles.    For Miguel and his family, moving the economy online could literally save lives.    Even if you can get there, and particularly if you have vulnerable family members at home, abandoning your social distancing mantra to join a long queue of people is probably not high on your agenda.      Miguel, who lives in Manila, knows how that feels. His sister is immunocompromised and they are quarantining together, so he is hyper aware of any situation that could risk infection. Add to this his enduring belief in bitcoin as the “unstoppable, uncensorable, non-confiscatable, self-sovereign, free and open financial system for all” (see Twitter) and it’s obvious that Miguel is hellbent on seeing the world go digital. In addition to all the benefits like greater connectivity, reduced costs and enhanced productivity, for Miguel and his family, moving the economy online could literally save lives. And with most of the usual analogue channels out of action, people and businesses in the Philippines are scrambling to do just that.      See also: Leah Callon-Butler - Coronavirus Is a Catalyst for Work-From-Home Tech      If I had to guess the nightmare narrative that keeps the CEO of Cebuana awake at night, it’s probably some Blockbuster-versus-Netflix tale of tech disruption. Thing is, if you just look at all the people whiling away the waiting time on their smartphones, that worst-case-scenario is already playing out in broad daylight. According to a 2019 report by Hootsuite and We Are Social, at 10 hours per day, Filipinos spend more time online than any other nation in the world, and they are the world’s number one users of Facebook. Nearly two thirds of the population own mobile phones and almost 70 percent have access to the internet. So even for a giant like Cebuana, the blatant reality is the same: Disrupt or be disrupted.      As the largest non-banking financial services provider in the Philippines, Cebuana probably could have taken a stake in almost any local fintech startup. But in 2019, Cebuana acquired a stake in SCI. In clear recognition of the alignment between crypto and international remittances, as well as other blockchain-based use cases such as digital ID and peer-to-peer payments, Cebuana signaled the first steps toward a major digital overhaul of their expensive, inefficient and non-scalable paper-based, bricks-and-mortar business.      Of course, Cebuana are not the only financial institution in the race to digital transformation, and notably, on the blockchain front, UnionBank’s UBX has successfully connected the rural banks of the Philippines to the main banking system via the i2i network, cutting processing times from days to minutes. With 2,500 branches nationwide and 25 million customers, Cebuana represents a formidable user base. It has the advantage of reach into rural areas, and one of the strongest footholds into the unbanked population – which is ultimately the largest consumer segment in the Philippines, if you can crack it. Whether it can translate all this into a digital leadership position remains untold, but the wheels appear to be in motion and coronavirus might add further momentum.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/14/filipino-pawnshops-bank-on-crypto-remittances-during-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b47178fc928b7200c7b05d58a76ca916eb2d31e-1368x1084.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404477,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLTI,1586876430,Options Market Signals Doubt Bitcoin Price Will Rise After Halving,"While some expect bitcoin’s (BTC) upcoming reward halving to light a fire under the cryptocurrency, the options market seems worried about the event turning out to be a wet blanket.       The biggest cryptocurrency by market value is set to undergo its third mining reward halving next month. The code, aimed at controlling inflation, would reduce the amount of bitcoin created every 10 minutes or so from 12.5 BTC to 6.25.       Assuming demand remains constant, the cut in regular issuance should drive up the price, bulls argue.       “The 50 percent emission cut could serve as a catalyst for the digital asset’s continued appreciation,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of crypto tracker and index fund provider Stack.       Options traders, however, are buying put options, or bearish bets, and pushing bitcoin’s put-call open interest ratio higher heading into the halving.       Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      The ratio rose to 0.61 on Monday, the highest level since Feb. 27, after bottoming out at 0.42 on March 24, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.       “The put-call open interest ratio measures the number of put options open relative to calls,” said Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh. A put option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy.      Open interest is the total number of options contracts active at a given point in time and is different from trading volume, which refers to the number of contracts traded in a given period.      “The rise in the put-call open interest ratio from 0.42 to 0.61 seen over the last three weeks indicates increased focus on hedging the downside risk in bitcoin’s price,” Goh said.       One possible motivation for this hedging is the fear bitcoin may suffer a post-halving price drop, similar to the one seen in litecoin (LTC) in 2019 and more recently in bitcoin’s offshoots bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin sv (SV).     Halving is not always bullish    Litecoin, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency, underwent reward halving on Aug. 5, 2019, after which the cryptocurrency’s price fell from $100 to $40 in the four months to mid-December.       During that timeframe Its hash rate, or the computing power dedicated to mining blocks on the blockchain, also declined from 458 tera hashes per second (TH/s) to 133 TH/s, according to BitInfoCharts.       Bitcoin cash’s mining rewards were cut from 12 BCH per block to 6.25 BCH on April 8. Since then, the cryptocurrency’s price has declined by nearly 20 percent from $280 to $225.      Bitcoin SV’s price fell over 13 percent from $214 to $186 on April 10, when it experienced its first halving, and has remained sidelined ever since.      Both bitcoin cash and bitcoin SV have witnessed a slowdown in network activity following reward halvings, as indicated by the drops in their respective hash rates.       The lackluster post-halving performance of these coins indicates that halving is not necessarily a price-bullish event.     Put options draw higher prices    To be sure, there is another possible explanation for the rise in the put-call open interest ratio, one that would augur well for bitcoin bulls.       The ratio can rise if there is an increase in the number of short open positions in put options. Seasoned option traders usually write, or sell, put options when they expect the market to remain sidelined or rally.       Read more: Looking for a Halving Payday? Quick Wins in Investing Are Rare      As a result, one might argue traders are expecting bitcoin to remain bid after halving and are selling put options, leading to a rise in the put-call open interest ratio.       The problem with that interpretation is put options are currently drawing higher prices compared to calls – a strong signal investors are buying puts.             The one-month 25-delta put-call skew, which measures the price of puts relative to that of calls, is hovering at 12 percent. The metric has consistently remained above zero since the beginning of March.      The three-month and six-month skews are also hovering above zero.      “It indicates that puts are in higher demand than calls,” said Goh, adding that the skew would have probably turned negative in case of increased put selling.      It's worth noting that writing (selling) options – put or call – is a “limited profit, unlimited loss” strategy. Traders are unlikely to take such risks in current market conditions, where bitcoin’s fortunes are closely tied with the coronavirus pandemic and the action in the equity markets.    Equities are not out of the woods yet    Apart from halving, the increased demand for put options could reflect fears of another macro-driven sell-off in bitcoin.      The S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark index, rallied 12 percent last week. As of Monday, the index was up 26 percent from the multi-year low of 2,792 registered on March 24.       However, some observers are worried the rally fueled by the Federal Reserve’s liquidity injections has lost touch with the reality – the number of coronavirus cases across the globe is still rising – and could soon unravel.

China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) published a list Sunday of the 71 companies and public entities that have joined its committee, which goes by the catchy title, the ""National Blockchain and Distributed Accounting Technology Standardization Technical Committee."" The group was formed to discuss and set industry standards for distributed ledger technology.      Unsurprisingly, the committee is weighted towards the country's expanding technology sector: Huawei, Baidu, fintech companies Tencent and Ant Financial, and e-commerce giant JD.com have all sent delegates, as have some of the country's technical universities and relevant enforcement agencies.      Various arms of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) involved in technological research – and the digital yuan initiative – are also represented.      See also: Why China Is Banning Crypto but Is Bullish on Blockchain      Other sectors are also represented, including insurance and banking conglomerates Ping An and Qianhai Wezhong Bank, as well as the car components manufacturer Wan Xiang.      Inviting a wide range of industries onto the committee may be a nod to a speech Premier Xi Jinping made in October in which he said China must ""seize the opportunity"" and drive technological innovation across all sectors using blockchain technology.      It's possible the standards agreed by the blockchain committee could influence regulators and industry bodies from other countries.      The MIIT has already tried to assert China's lead when it comes to digital assets. Back in 2018, an affiliated research group began producing publicly available assessments of cryptocurrencies based on their tech capabilities and use cases.      See also: China Has Many Strategic Reasons to Invest in Blockchain      Huawei has long been bullish on China's blockchain scene.

42404476,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLQL,1586873471,'The Great Lockdown': IMF Confirms Global Recession,"The coronavirus economic crisis officially has a name: the Great Lockdown.      “The Great Lockdown is the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis [of 2008],” International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said on Tuesday.      She projected the global economy will contract by 3 percent in 2020, due to $9 trillion in losses. The United States is expected to decline to roughly -6 percent growth, as are other nations in the advanced economy group. Gopinath said this year’s losses will “dwarf” the global financial crisis 12 years ago.      ""For the first time since the Great Depression both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies are in recession,"" Gopinath said.      Furthermore, the IMF projected that vulnerable oil-exporting countries, like Iraq, will “be forced to make aggregate cuts,” according to IMF Research Director Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti. For example, the IMF predicts the Iraqi economy will contract to -4.7 percent growth this year, down roughly 8 percentage points from 2019’s growth rate of 3.9 percent, while the Iranian economy will contract to -6 percent growth this year.      Overall, the IMF is encouraging debtors to forgive lenders and for leaders to cooperate on joint efforts to prevent de-globalization. The IMF said more than 90 of its 189 member states have requested financial support.      “We’re projecting for economic activity to still be below pre-virus levels in 2021,” said Gopinath. “This is a deep recession that involves insolvency issues and unemployment rates going up dramatically.”      Gopinath said nations with access to private-sector digital payment systems should use them to distribute aid and stimulus packages. Although she didn’t specify technologies by name, the U.S. Treasury is already working with fintech giants including PayPal and Square while Kenya relies on the mobile money product M-Pesa to decrease in-person transactions.",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/14/the-great-lockdown-imf-confirms-global-recession,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c9a5ed227a6c7a6a2e43f03e35a26573ee746c7-1500x1036.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404468,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLKR,1586869200,Coinbase Custody to Support Polkadot Staking With up to 20% Returns,"Coinbase Custody is launching staking support for holders of Polkadot’s DOT tokens with the help of blockchain infrastructure firm Bison Trails.      Announced Tuesday, the integration allows DOT holders to keep their tokens in offline Coinbase Custody vaults and stake them through Bison Trails validators. DOT staking is integral to Polkadot’s proof-of-stake (PoS) network, which is said to reward those who commit their tokens with up to 20 percent returns.      “For people who custody with Coinbase Custody and want to stake with secure and highly available Bison Trails validators, this integration is a game changer,” Joe Lallouz, CEO of Bison Trails, said in a press statement. “DOT holders now have the unique ability to utilize both our leading blockchain infrastructure and the leading custodian of crypto assets to ensure tokens are secure and that they are earning participatory rewards.”      The integration follows Bison Trail’s and Coinbase Custody’s February partnerships with multi-chain interoperability protocol Polkadot. Coinbase Custody allowed account holders to claim DOTs, and Bison Trails ran one of the first validators on the experimental Kusama “Canary Net.” Polkadot's mainnet has not yet launched.      Also read: Coinbase Custody Goes International With New Entity in Ireland      Bison Trails and Coinbase’s integration will extend beyond Polkadot, however. As PoS models take on greater prominence in the cryptosphere, Coinbase Custody CEO Sam McIngvale, who called staking “increasingly important,” in the press statement, said that partners like Bison Trails will be invaluable resources to clients.      Staking “provides Coinbase Custody clients, many of whom have obligations to their investors, with a crypto-native way to participate in network rewards while also contributing to the security and governance of the ecosystem,” McIngvale said.      Bison Trails and Coinbase Custody plan to add staking service for other blockchains over time.

42404458,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLBa,1586865629,G20 Watchdog Warns Nations to Mitigate Risks Posed by Libra-Like Stablecoins,"The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has warned national regulators to review standards and address any possible disruptions caused by global stablecoins such as libra.      In a consultation report published Tuesday, the FSB – a G20 body advising on ways to improve the global financial system – said many activities associated with stablecoins were already covered by regulatory frameworks, but there are other risks for which national regulators could be left unprepared.      The organization argued that much of the technology and mechanisms used in stablecoins were untested at scale, meaning functioning digital assets may have hidden vulnerabilities that emerge only as they gear up for mainstream use.      ""If users relied upon a stablecoin to make regular payments, significant operational disruptions could quickly affect real economic activity,"" the FSB said in its report. ""Large-scale flows of funds into or out of the GSC [global stablecoin] could test the ability of the supporting infrastructure to handle high transaction volumes and the financing conditions of the wider financial system.""      See also: Cryptos Could Challenge ‘Any Financial Framework’: New FSB Chair      The watchdog also said national regulators need to monitor the fast pace of innovation in the digital asset space to try and anticipate any weaknesses or regulatory holes before they take effect. All member countries should ""clarify regulatory powers and address potential gaps in their domestic frameworks to adequately address risks posed by GSCs.""      Because stablecoins work across borders, the FSB argues countries should coordinate and consult with how other countries regulate stablecoins. A joint approach could encourage consistency and reduce ""opportunities for cross-sectoral and cross-border regulatory arbitrage,"" it said.      Countries applying regulation on a sector-by-sector basis might need to change to ensure stablecoin activity is properly covered, according to the report.      Although the FSB doesn't mention libra by name, the report talks about some of the concerns that have been raised since Facebook unveiled the digital currency project last June. For example, it warns developing economies might fall under the influence of foreign institutions should stablecoins replace their local fiat currencies.      The FSB's call for comprehensive and transparent stablecoin regulation mirrors other doubts surrounding libra. Earlier this year, Mastercard's then-CEO said one of the reasons the payment processing company exited the Libra Association was on concerns its hazy regulatory status could make it a haven for money launderers and other criminals.      See also: Libra Association Exec: World Needs Us Because Bitcoin Is ‘Not a Means of Payment’      The stablecoin report is currently in public consultation, with the FSB looking for additional feedback from 68 member institutions, which include enforcement agencies from the U.S, China and the European Union as well as entities including the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Bank for International Settlements.

42404481,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLUH,1586864397,First Mover: Bitcoin Market Goes Into 'Backwardation' Despite Fed's Trillions,"Bitcoin is searching for a direction.      After a wild couple months in crypto markets that saw a ferocious sell-off as the coronavirus spread, followed by a 30 percent price rebound as governments and central banks announced trillions of dollars of emergency financing, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency has settled into a range between $6,700 and $7,400.      For bitcoin (BTC) holders, it's a buzzkill.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Earlier this year, before the extent of coronavirus-related economic damage become clear, bulls had pegged their hopes on May's halving, a once-every-four-years reduction in the pace of new supplies of the cryptocurrency. The reduced supply and continuing demand from investors was supposed to drive up the price. The German bank BayernLB predicted in 2019 that the halving could drive bitcoin to $90,000 or higher.      But the hopes of a halving-fueled price run-up faded somewhat after last week's halvings of two bitcoin offshoots – bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin sv (BSV) – proved to be market duds.      Mati Greenspan, founder of research firm Quantum Economics, wrote Monday in a note to clients that ""in the long term, fewer new coins will likely translate into a higher price per coin.""      But in the short term?      ""I'm not convinced that the halving event will have any immediate effect on the price,"" Greenspan wrote. ""It might, but then again, it might not.""      Not so convincing.      Nor is bitcoin getting much follow-through from the recent rally, which was fueled by investor bets that the cryptocurrency can serve as a hedge against inflation and rampant monetary stimulus. The money hydrant is certainly open: The U.S. Federal Reserve's balance sheet pushed past $6 trillion last week for the first time in its 107-year history.      Kevin Kelly, co-founder of the cryptocurrency-focused research firm Delphi Digital, wrote in a report Monday the Fed's recent money injections might just be a start, given the broad-based contraction in economic activity as coronavirus-related lockdowns drag on.      ""Put simply, the U.S. economy cannot endure months on end of little to no revenue without government support,"" Kelly wrote.      The Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs wrote that stocks are unlikely to make fresh lows due to the ""do whatever it takes"" approach of policy makers.      Bitcoin is a likely beneficiary, too, according to cryptocurrency investment firm Arca.      ""Unless global equity and debt markets crater, bitcoin seems to have a higher floor now,"" Arca analysts wrote Monday in an emailed note. ""It is very hard to short risk assets into a wall of cash.""      CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey reports that bitcoin markets have gone into ""backwardation"" – where futures contracts trade at a discount to the spot price. According to Skew, a cryptocurrency-derivatives data provider, the June contract is trading around $6,750, below the spot-market price of $6,875 as of late Monday.      The discount could signal that traders are betting on price declines over the next two months, in a shift from last week when futures were trading at a premium.      “Futures and our own activity indicate that speculators expect to see lower prices in the short term,” said Maxine Boonen, CEO of over-the-counter trading firm B2C2. “One particular hedge fund sold us $20 million of bitcoin today and they have usually been right.”      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto investment brokerage Bequant, said if bitcoin breaks below $6,500, futures traders might face a wave of contract liquidations that could send prices as low as $6,100.      ""This cautious tone is supported by a shift in the futures curve,” he told CoinDesk.      According to Arca, the negative sentiment might even be a bullish indicator: If traders are already pessimistic, it's possible that the bad news is already priced in.      Arca noted the number of tether tokens – a dollar-linked stablecoin that has become the de facto form of cash in digital-asset markets – has climbed to a record level around $1.9 billion in exchange wallets.      That could signal more traders are getting in position to buy.      ""Prices can certainly go down, but it would not be surprising if they keep melting up,"" Arca wrote.      Not exactly a clear direction.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin continues to mimic action in U.S. stock futures. The top cryptocurrency by market value rose from $6,700 to $6,900 early Tuesday, tracking an uptick in futures tied to the S&P 500.      The futures had dropped on Monday, pushing bitcoin down to $6,600, but turned higher during Tuesday's Asian trading hours. The rise came after China reported a surprise 2.4 percent surge in imports in March, lessening fears of a deep economic slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.      The optimism, however, could be brief because the U.S. quarterly corporate earnings season begins Tuesday and is expected to put the focus back on the coronavirus-led economic downturn and the Federal Reserve's multiple liquidity injections. As a result, upticks in bitcoin, if any, could be short-lived.      From a technical analysis standpoint, bitcoin's immediate bias is bearish, with the daily chart reporting a rising wedge breakdown. The relative strength index, too, has dived out of an ascending trendline – an indication that the path of least resistance is to the downside. Should prices find acceptance under Monday's low of $6,600, more sellers may join the market, causing a deeper drop toward $6,000.      Alternatively, a daily close (UTC) above the descending 50-day average at $7,091 would invalidate the bearish trend. That looks unlikely at press time, though prices are up 2.5 percent over the last 24 hours.      Options market metrics are bearish on bitcoin, too. For instance, the put-call open interest ratio jumped to a 6.5-week high of 0.61 on Monday, indicating increased demand for put options. Validating that argument is the positive 25-delta skew, which indicates price or demand for put options is currently higher than for calls (bullish bets).

42404474,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLPM,1586863115,Bitcoin Stuck Below $7K Even as Gold Surges to Over 7-Year High,"Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to gather upside traction on Tuesday despite a rally to multi-year highs for gold.      The biggest cryptocurrency by market value, often touted as ""digital gold,"" is trading near $6,900 at press time, representing a marginal gain on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Prices jumped from $6,800 to $6,930 early Tuesday after better-than-expected China trade data for March pushed S&P 500 futures higher. The upward momentum, however, has stalled even though the futures are holding gains.      Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is changing hands near $1,717, up 0.5 percent on the day, having hit a 7.5-year high of $1,730 during the Asian trading hours. The yellow metal is now up 9 percent on a month-to-date basis, while bitcoin is lagging with just a 5 percent gain.      Gold seems to be benefiting from the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent monetary stimulus, which has pushed its balance sheet above $6 trillion for the first time on record.      Also read: Why the US’ $2 Trillion Stimulus, Unlimited QE Will Expose the Monetary System’s Flaws      The expansion is likely to continue as the central bank's ongoing asset purchase program is open-ended, meaning it will keep buying bonds as long as the economy needs support in battling downside pressures emanating from the coronavirus outbreak. Historically, the Fed's balance sheet expansion has boded well for gold's price.      Further, uncertainty around the short- and long-term economic impacts of the virus pandemic is forcing investors to pour money into safe havens like gold and U.S. Treasurys, according to the World Gold Council.      Most crypto market analysts are convinced the factors, which are pushing gold higher, are bullish for bitcoin. Essentially, the cryptocurrency is expected to take up the role of a safe-haven asset.      However, Frank Shostak, an associated scholar of the Mises Institute and chief economist and director of AAS Economics, thinks investors would prefer holding cash or investing in treasuries. ""I am skeptical that in the time of a severe recession, people would want to deal with an electronic type of entity,"" said Shostak.      It's worth noting that bitcoin has moved pretty much in line with the equity markets, or risk assets, right from the beginning of the coronavirus crisis.      That makes it vulnerable to another round of selling in equities, which may be seen as a raft of U.S. corporate earnings reports due this week is expected to highlight the coronavirus-led downturn in the world's largest economy.      Short-term technical charts indicate the cryptocurrency is lacking a clear directional bias.    Daily chart    Bitcoin created a long-tailed candle on Monday, indicating dip demand near $6,600 and weakening the immediate bearish view put forward by a rising wedge breakdown seen on Friday.      The cryptocurrency also encountered bearish pressures near $7,200 on weekend, as indicated by the long upper shadow attached to Sunday's candle.      The outlook, therefore, will remain neutral as long as prices are trapped in the $6,600–$7,200 range. A break above the top end could bring in stronger chart-driven buying and yield a rally toward $7,800. Alternatively, a move below the lower end of the trading range would open the doors to $7,100.

Bitmain said Tuesday that buyers of its AntMiner S17+ and T17+ devices with delivery dates between mid-February and the end of April will receive coupons worth from $17 to $272 per unit – a move that reflects the lasting impact of last month’s crash in bitcoin prices and the expected mining revenue drop due to bitcoin’s halving event in May.      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      For instance, for buyers who received their AntMiner S17+ pre-orders in late March, Bitmain will compensate them with coupons worth around $240 per unit. For those who have received or will receive their AntMiner S17+ throughout April, the partial refund will be around $270.      The coupons, which can only be used when purchasing additional goods at Bitmain, also signal tougher market conditions for the sales of mining equipment currently – a factor likely to decrease Bitmain's revenue and increase liabilities on its balance sheet.      For context, Bitmain typically sells its newest miners based on a pre-order model, with customers paying full retail price upfront for a delivery that will take place usually two or three months later.      Also read: Bitcoin Halving: How Miners Are Preparing for Lower Block Rewards      As such, those who received their AntMiner S17+ delivery in early April might have originally paid well above the current price of the device. All miner manufacturers have been marking down their prices following the March 12 crash and with the halving arriving soon.      As an example, Bitmain was advertising a price of $1,567 per unit for the AntMiner S17+ earlier this month (although some resellers at the time were already quoting a price of around $1,300). The firm has now adjusted the official price on its website to $1,320, representing a 15.7-percent markdown.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/14/bitmain-partially-refunds-bitcoin-miner-buyers-after-price-cuts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd5181b9dc7c4b4c9405606ab4dffc6631b99492-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The freshly inked deal will see the Beijing-based video platform use the peer-to-peer infrastructure from New Kind of Network (NKN) to help boost buffering speeds and reduce energy consumption and network congestion, NKN announced in a press release on Tuesday.      The joint effort marks a step forward in the development and interoperability of two emerging technological innovations, blockchain and edge computing, NKN said.      ""NKN's main focus is networking infrastructure, in order to enable sharing of bandwidth and Internet connectivity,"" said Zheng ""Bruce"" Li, co-founder at NKN, told CoinDesk in an email interview.      ""Edge computing is critical for video streaming, game streaming, high-speed autonomous driving, AR/VR and IoT, and blockchain can play a significant role in it,"" Li explained. Used to improve response times and save bandwidth, edge computing uses distributed systems to brings computation and data storage closer to site of demand.      During an April 1 trial, the teams noted a major increase in caching savings, a type of short-term computer memory in which information is stored or hidden for easy retrieval at a later date.      iQiyi was founded by internet giant Baidu in April 2010 and has since grown to well over 500 million users and nearly six billion hours of time spent on its service each month, according to Wikipedia.      See also: 3 Web Giants That Could Be Decentralized on a Blockchain      The video platform is now integrating with NKN's blockchain in order to utilize its ""micro-hosting network management"" for deploying and managing third-party content delivery network (CDN) software running on the platform.      CDN is a system of distributed servers that provide web content to a user based on their geographic location, as well as the host site of the webpage and the content delivery server.      NKN's blockchain uses a proof-of-relay (PoR) mining algorithm that randomly selects a small number of fixed data packets as ""proof"" before sending that data to other nodes for payment and reward.

42431712,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5ifh,1586836800,FBI Warns COVID-19 Scammers Are Targeting Crypto Holders,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned Monday that fraudsters are about to unleash a surge of coronavirus cryptocurrency scams.      According to the FBI, the threat is universal, unyielding, opportunistic and incredibly dangerous. The issue is compounded by the fact that an increasing number of merchants are now accepting crypto, the warning said.      “Fraudsters are leveraging increased fear and uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic to steal your money and launder it through the complex cryptocurrency ecosystem,” and they’re targeting victims regardless of their age, the FBI said.      Agents believe these scammers will tailor their pitch to the current situation, perhaps posing as newly remote workers collecting “donations” via email, safety equipment vendors working beyond established e-commerce, or even as “charities” that take cryptocurrency, which is “a significant red flag.”      Scams may also come in more traditional methods like blackmail but with a twist: The scammer threatens to “infect you and/or your family with coronavirus unless payment is sent to a bitcoin wallet.”      Agents advise internet users to employ common sense, verify the legitimacy of vendors, stay away from their bank accounts and report blackmail and extortion attempts to law enforcement.      The FBI did not immediately respond to questions on what prompted the warning.      The warning is the latest government-level warning about COVID-19 crypto scams, a scourge spanning the globe as quickly as the virus. Thieves have stolen $2 million in crypto from panicking PPE-seekers in Asia, swarmed U.K. cellphones with malicious text messages, and spooked financial regulators, including the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      Whether these pandemic-themed scams are any more or less effective than their traditional counterparts is not known.
