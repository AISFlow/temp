42382009,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRT9,1559430007,Block.One Is Launching a Social Media Platform on the EOS Blockchain,"While Facebook pursues crypto, crypto is pursuing social media.  Block.one – the multibillion-dollar startup that built the EOSIO platform – is the latest blockchain firm with social-media aspirations. Announced Saturday at a glitzy event in Washington, D.C., the new platform is called Voice.  Block.one says Voice will stand out by not turning its users into products.  In a release, CEO Brendan Blumer said:  ""Our content. Our data. Our attention. These are all incredibly valuable things. But right now, it’s the platform, not the user, that reaps the reward. By design, they run by auctioning our information to advertisers, pocketing the profit, and flooding our feeds with hidden agendas dictated by the highest bidder. Voice changes that.”  Voice will run on the EOS blockchain, which is also upgrading to a faster Version 2.0. By using the public chain, everything posted to EOS will be public. Meanwhile, the leading social network in the world, Facebook, announced earlier this year it would move in the opposite direction – with CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlining a “privacy-focused vision for social networking.”  Excitement in DC  At an event with the production values one might expect from a company that has raised $4 billion in funding, Blumer came out on stage and offered a manifesto against social media as we know it. (You can watch the full keynote herehttps://player.vimeo.com/video/339755656.)  ""Our attention has been captured,"" Blumer told the crowd. ""Social media has not been a good friend to us.""  He promised that Block.one's new social media product would not let algorithms decide what dominates. Everyone, he said, would have an equal shot to be heard.  ""Everyone – the user, the platform, the contributor – plays by the same rules,"" Blumer said.  He also promised that Voice will do a better job of keeping out bots and trolls than previous social networks, without really going into the mechanics of doing so. Previously, though, Block.one brought on stage a product lead from Yubico, the makers of YubiKey, to talk about ways in which EOS would integrate with WebAuthn, a password-less standard recently approved by the W3C, which governs the worldwide web.  All attendees at the event were given a new YubiKey.  At the end of Blumer's talk, the massive screen behind him exhorted viewers to ""Unlike shady algorithms"" and ""Unfollow being followed.""  Then it was Block.one CTO Dan Larimer's turn.  ""Social media was intended for good,"" said Larimer, who previously co-founded a blockchain-based social media site, Steemit, before leaving for Block.one in 2017.  He came on stage to announce a new token, the Voice token. ""Everyone who signs up for Voice will get an EOS account,"" he said.  The chief mechanic Larimer showed off was one in which users could stake Voice tokens to move to the top of a chain of comments. If someone else staked tokens to go above them, the first user would get their tokens back and then some.  This additional pressure on the EOS blockchain should be partially offset by another announcement Larimer made: EOSVM.  ""This is a WebAssembly engine designed specifically for blockchain,"" Larimer said, promising it would run 12-times faster than the original EOSIO software, which was released on June 1, 2018.  Signups for Voice beta access are now open at Voice.com.  ""We can't wait to see what people will do with it,"" Larimer said.  Earlier attempts  Social-media-oriented crypto projects up to this point have largely resembled Tumblr or Medium, with the occasional Twitter imitation.  While the argument for incentivizing contributions is compelling, the model has had a hard time catching on.  For example, in 2016, Tsu, a social network that promised to share its earnings with its users, shut down. It claimed to have 5.2 million users when the service ended. A frequent complaint about Tsu was that its promise of remuneration generated spammy behavior.  Steemit, meanwhile, is the Medium-like social network built on top of the Steem blockchain. According to Dapp.com, it was the only major dapp blockchain where social media was the dominant use case, with 93 percent of users touching its social dapps (of which, Steemit dominates). A recent estimate from May put the active users in that month at 75,644.  Other crypto social networks have come along since, such as Coil (which uses XRP) and Cent (which uses ETH).  Dapp.com estimated that Steem had over 386,000 active users for the year, while it gave EOS slightly over 171,000 active users in 2018, with 67 percent using its betting products.  It's worth noting that EOS only had six months in which to build up a user base. After a yearlong ICO that generated more than $4 billion for Block.one, EOS officially launched on June 15, 2018.

42382008,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRUP,1559383201,Bitcoin SV Was the Best Performing Crypto in May – And it Wasn't Close,"The cryptocurrency markets saw rapid growth in May with quite a few outshining the largest by market capitalization, bitcoin.  The leading cryptocurrency drew most of the attention, rising 67 percent from $5,265 on May 1st to $8,900 by month’s end. A considerable amount of the gains happened in the lead up to the New York Blockchain event, that took place during the second week of May.  For instance, sharp rallies in bitcoin’s price on May 11 and May 13 pushed its price tag above $7,000 and then $8,000 for the first time in over a year.  Despite logging its best monthly gain since 2017 however, BTC ranks tenth on the list of May's best-performing cryptocurrencies, according to Messari.io data.  Names like Chainlink (LINK), Dent (DENT), bitcoin SV (BSV), Holochain (HOT) and bitcoin gold (BTG) took a clear lead, each rising between 65 and 256 percent against their respective trading pairs with the U.S dollar.  The total capitalization of the broader market excluding bitcoin reflected the growth by rising to $125.6 billion on May 30th– its highest value in nearly 10 months.  Bitcoin pairings  The performance of individual altcoins when paired against BTC fared much worse, however.  Ether’s pairing with BTC, for example, found itself still unable to scale its 200-day moving average for much of the month, and at the time of writing has only increased roughly 2 percent since May 1 whereas its USD pair is currently up over 60 percent in the same time span.  Such a discrepancy between the performance of both pairs can be attributed to bitcoin's price rally inflating the USD value of most altcoins while devaluing in BTC terms.  That said, a number of cryptocurrencies were able to flash strong performances in both categories, case in point being the top five performers for the month of May seen below.  Top 5 Monthly Performers In May  BSV  | Price: $197 | MCAP: $3.5 billion | Percent Change: +231 percent  The crypto project aptly named ‘Satoshi’s Vision’ claims to be the “original bitcoin,"" by restoring BTC’s first protocol while stating that it can massively scale with increased stability.  Bitcoin SV had a remarkable run during May and was the clear leader during the second half of the month after prices broke out on May 21, bringing it back above the elusive $100 price tag.  Prices peaked at $252 according to data from Bittrex after landing itself in overbought territory and triggering a pullback, as shown by the daily relative strength index (RSI) exceeding a value of 70.  BSV/USD remains bullishly bid above a technical resistance level of $148, but a strong close below could re-expose the $90 support in the coming weeks.  LINK  | Price: $1.01 | MCAP: $364.3 million | Percent Change: +96 percent  Chainlink’s (LINK) staggering 200 percent rise in mid-May suffered a setback as the monthly close approached, but today remains 96 percent up on the month, placing it firmly in 2nd place within the top 5 performers for May.  Concerns are now building for greater drawdown, courtesy of a candle close below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement line on the daily chart, exposing the neutral pivot along the 50 percent retracement at $0.84.  Prices remain bullishly bid above the 200-daily moving average (red line) and above a key resistance that became support at $0.68, but expect a pullback if its price breaks below the neutral 50 percent retracement.  DENT  | Price: $0.001747 | MCAP: $124.1 million | Percent Change: 78 percent  DENT is a token issued on the ethereum blockchain that aims to facilitate global communications via its platform and service offerings.  Its performance on the month was bullish to say the least, concluding May with a 78 percent higher price than it started and ranking as the 3rd best performer of the month.  However, recent market developments have thrown into contention the short-term bullish trend as prices dipped below a key support by the time the monthly trading period came to a close.  Similar to that of LINK, the longer term view remains bullish while trading above the 200-day moving average (red line), which looks set to complete positive crossover with the 100-day moving average on another significant upward move.  BTG  | Price: $26.71 | MCAP: $475.8 million | Percent Change: +64 percent  Bitcoin Gold (BTG), yet another bitcoin fork, changed BTC’s proof-of-work algorithm from SHA256 to Equihash, rendering specialized mining equipment obsolete in an attempt to democratize the mining process.  Traders heavily favored BTG buy opportunities in May, leading it to place as the 5th best-performing crypto this month, outperforming other notable bitcoin forks such as bitcoin diamond (BCD) and bitcoin private (BTCP).  BTG’s rising channel spanning more than four months looks set to break down courtesy of a rising wedge (bear reversal pattern) residing within the channel's most recent price action. In addition, a long upper wick on the daily timeframe is evidence strong sell pressure still exists above $30.  Should momentum falter here, a drop in value toward the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement line at $20.34 may be in the offing, but will remain bullish so long as the channel pattern holds.  HOT  | Price: $0.002165 | MCAP: $288.4 million | Percent Change: +74 percent  Holochain (HOT) is a decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent-centric agreement and consensus mechanisms between users.  Beginning in late May, HOT managed to break a key resistance zone of $0.0016, carving out a further 57 percent rise in value before prices peaked at $0.0027 on May 29.  From there it has been a downhill battle for HOT with the forfeiture of the 38.2 percent retracement line opening up the neutral pivot point at $0.0018 (50 percent retracement).  If prices continue to falter, buying pressure is likely to support HOT near $0.0016 due to it being a previous resistance zone.

42381997,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qRAH,1559379618,"Who Has the Power, Retail or Institutional Investors?","Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in cryptoassets, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.      There’s a scene in Pixar’s ""A Bug’s Life"" (a very underrated movie) where Hopper (the evil grasshopper) clocks his whiny brother with a seed. And then another. Neither really hurt, obviously. He then opens the valve to the large seed granary, and ouch.  The point Hopper was successfully making was that size and might do not necessarily equal power. That lies with the seeds, I mean the masses. Volume trumps influence.  We hear so much about “institutional influence” in the crypto markets that it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that institutions alone will decide when the next bull run will start. The “wall of institutional money” that most of us were breathlessly expecting in early 2018 was supposed to push the price of bitcoin and other assets “to the moon,” and savvy retail investors would tag along for the joyous ride (in a lambo).  A year later, we no longer talk about the “wall,” instead we are focusing on the infrastructure building and waiting for large incumbents to loudly declare their allegiance. Now we’re repeatedly told that “when Goldman/State Street/BNY start offering crypto services,” institutions will pile in.  A year later, we’re still missing the point.  Bridging the gap  Here’s the thing: “institutions” are not stand-alone entities that operate in a separate microcosm from the rest of the economy. Most hold retail money: the vast majority of institutional assets under management are held by pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies. They are not going to make investment decisions without some assurance that their clients will be ok with this.  There are exceptions, true. Hedge funds, family offices and endowments cater to different constituencies. They can take more risk, often have a more innovative base and aren’t subject to the same rules and restrictions. But – sizeable as they may be – they are a small percentage of global wealth.  And they are, to varying degrees, already investing in cryptoassets. A survey earlier this month by Fidelity Investments and Greenwich Associates showed that over 20% of institutional investors already have some exposure. Another survey published last month by Global Custodian and BitGo revealed that 94% of endowments had already invested in the asset class. Grayscale Investment’s Q1 report released a couple of weeks ago showed a strong increasehttps://grayscale.co/digital-asset-investment-report-q1-2019/ in family office participation.  The vast bulk of institutional money, however, is still waiting, and it’s not for an announcement from Goldman Sachs or its peers (although that wouldn’t hurt sector confidence). It’s not for a more comprehensive build-out of market infrastructure (although that is helping). It’s not even for regulatory clarity (although that would also be very good news).  It’s for mainstream retail interest to kick into gear.  In position  When the clients of pension funds, investment advisors, mutual funds and the like ask about crypto assets, then a broader base of institutional investors will scramble to get informed. When the chatter about the concept in the respective investor communities grows to a volume that can’t be ignored, then even more large intermediaries will roll out new services.  Many smart institutions are getting ahead of the curve and positioning themselves with services that can satisfy the inbound interest. These early leaders are earning valuable experience and mindshare (not to mention revenue), as well as adding layers of professionalism and reassurance to the new markets.  Nevertheless, crypto is still far away from “mainstream.” To us in the sector it may seem like a flood of new infrastructure entrants over the past year has lifted awareness, interest from all sectors is growing strongly, and the regulators have not been sitting idle.  Yet crypto is, looking in from the outside, still very niche – total crypto market cap is miniscule compared to other investable assets, and for many, buying crypto is too complicated to bother with.  Crypto is also still seen as risky. Scams and hacks still weaken its reputation, it is still tough for crypto businesses to get solid banking relationships, and the tax situation in most jurisdictions is just plain confusing.  Taking notice  A glance at some recent headlines shows that is starting to change.  TD Ameritrade, one of the largest retail brokers in the world, is planning on offering crypto trading to its almost 12 million clients via institutional-grade exchange ErisX, in which it has taken a stake. On stage at Consensus earlier this month, executive vice president Steve Quirk recounted the “off the chart” interest in their crypto education series. According to reports, online retail broker eTrade is also planning to offer crypto trading to its almost 5 million clients.  Just last week, stock trading app Robinhood – which claims 6 million retail user accounts – announced the addition of New York to the list of US states in which it can offer crypto trading, with approval from the New York Financial Services Department.  The growth in the retail crypto audience goes beyond trading opportunities. Crypto assets and their virtues are being dangled in front of millions of retail investors with a series of media pushes. Last week, CBS’s news broadcast “60 Minutes” ran a segment on bitcoin. Earlier this month, asset manager Grayscale Investments revealed a stirring TV spot urging investors to “drop gold.” And since early this year, striking ads by institutional exchange Gemini, plastered on buses, taxis, billboards, bus stops and train stations in major cities across the US, announced that “crypto” is not the Wild West it once was.  Retail interest momentum seems to be building, but the “tipping point,” in which it is loud enough to get a broader swathe of the institutional sector to start investing in crypto (which in turn will encourage other institutional investors to join in), may be a way off yet. Or it may be just around the corner. The tipping point may be something as obvious as a bitcoin ETF launch, or it may simply be a cumulation of subliminal indications.  Meanwhile, rather than treat the two pools of demand as separate, those of us focusing on institutional interest need to keep an eye on retail developments.  Up we go  But just as the institutional sector needs retail interest to trigger a deeper commitment, so does the retail sector need the institutional channels. Without the support and oversight of institutional partners such as trusted advisors, familiar brokers, mutual fund managers and pension fund allocators, most retail investors will probably not feel comfortable enough to take the plunge on their own.  Retail investors may be increasingly noticing and digging into cryptocurrencies – but for this interest to hit scale, they need institutional support.  At the end of A Bug’s Life, Heimlich the plump caterpillar undergoes a cheerful metamorphosis and emerges with colourful wings that are unfortunately too small to carry his considerable heft. He can’t use these new tools effectively by himself. Not to worry – his airborne teammates have a lot of experience with the new infrastructure. They help him to soar over the landscape.
