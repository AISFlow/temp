42426716,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9jh,1458335438,Bitcoin Prices Stable As Volatile Ethereum Draws Trader Interest,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.  Bitcoin prices traded largely between $410 and $420 during the week between 11th March and 18th March, as 30m BTC was traded on exchanges globally.  The digital currency’s price movements were largely subdued, starting the week out at $416.24 on 11th March at 12:00 UTC before surpassing the $420 level at 09:10 UTC. For the remainder of the week through 12:00 UTC on 18th March, the digital currency remained range-bound between $410 and $420.  Since then, bitcoin’s price has weakened, falling at around 14:00 UTC to a press time low of $403.63 at 19:45 UTC, a decline of $11.43 over the course of the day’s trading.  However, the modest price movements may have been overshadowed by the sudden attention given to ether, the token that powers the Ethereum blockchain.  Ether, which has been generating significant visibility as a digital asset, experienced sharp fluctuations during the week. The development is notable as ether serves as a way to run applications on the Ethereum blockchain and is not positioning itself as a store of value.  Ethereum released Homestead, the first production version of its software, on 14th March. Because of Ethereum’s success in drawing attention, some members of the digital currency trading community believe that ether is starting to serve as an attractive hedge for the uncertainty surrounding bitcoin.  The bitcoin community is currently grappling with uncertainty caused by perceived issues about the size of its processing capacity, with some arguing the protocol needs to be upgraded to accommodate more users and others proposing top-level networks that would build on its stability.  Amid this situation, Ethereum is ""emerging as a strong hedge against bitcoin,"" digital currency expert Joseph Lee told CoinDesk. Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives trading platform Magnr, emphasized that earlier this month, many bitcoiners were ""buying ether to profit from its current state of renewed interest.""  Despite the attention, however, ether trading remains in early stages. A large majority of the exchange trading currently takes place on a single exchange, US-based Poloniex, though other major market players Coincheck and Bitfinex have recently added offerings.  Bitcoin stability  Yet, while Ethereum may be appealing to digital currency traders with a higher appetite for risk, there are some who view bitcoin's relative stability over the week as a position sign.  Christopher Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest, for example, noted that Ethereum peaked around the time of its launch, and that its price had since fallen as early adopters sought to cash in on the new attention.  ""Now that ether is down about 40% from its all time high, and still falling, it’s interesting to see bitcoin holding its price. I would have expected to see a bit more of a pop,"" he told CoinDesk.  Prior to today's decline, bitcoin had a steady week, rising about 1% from $416.10 12:00 UTC on 11th March to $418.32 at 12:00 UTC at 12:00 UTC today.  Market observer George Samman also noted that the bitcoin market, to some extent, benefits from a more active market for Ethereum.  “The thing that I look at though is how are people cashing out of Ethereum, really there is one major way and that's through bitcoin, so if you want to sell out of Ethereum for fiat you need to go through bitcoin and vice versa to buy,” he noted.  Ether's volatile start  By contrast, $56.9m worth of the ether digital asset was transacted during the 24-hour period ending between 12:00 and 23:59 on 14th March, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  Trading volume has risen sharply this month compared to February, having reached a 24-hour volume of $57.6m on 6th March between 00:00 and 11:59.  Amid this robust trading volume, Ethereum plunged from a weekly high of 0.036 BTC at 20:00 UTC on 13th March to a weekly low of 0.021 BTC at 12:00 UTC on 18th March, additional CoinMarketCap data shows.  This decline represented a 41.7% drop, which contrasted with the roughly flat week-over-week price movement Ethereum experienced between 12:00 UTC on 11th March and 12:00 UTC on 18th March, registering 0.026 BTC both times.

42426707,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Rh,1458324390,Why Fragmentation Threatens the Promise of Blockchain Identity,"William Mougayar is a Toronto-based entrepreneur, investor and advisor to Consensus 2016, CoinDesk's flagship conference. He is also the author of the upcoming book, The Business Blockchain.  Here, he discusses the consumer, business and ethical challenges facing blockchain entrepreneurs seeking to innovate with identity applications.  The vision of blockchain-based identity promises to empower users to be in complete control of their identity.  This promise could lead to easy, single or seamless sign-ons that zigzag Internet users straight through the maze of entry and access points to unlock personal information, access services and transact digital assets.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of innovation and creativity exhibited by the various startups and technology companies, I’m worried that a multiplicity of options might end-up fragmenting user acceptance and pushing us further away from a critical mass of user adoption.  In its simplest form, the blockchain can be used to uniquely authenticate your identification, in irrefutable and immutable ways, because your ""keys"" are your identity. But, what happens if you need several keys instead of just one, because every service you use requires a different one?  Imagine if you had five keys to your house, and depending on the day, or the entry point you'd need to use a different one. Or, if you had five different homes in different parts of the world, you would certainly come up with a way to keep your keys. It's definitely possible, but burdensome.  Online, we are already challenged by keeping track of multiple passwords in our heads, or in notes, and we’re always worried about getting hacked potentially, or forgetting them.  I would expect that blockchain-assisted identity and access solutions can help us arrive at better solutions than the current ones.  Solutions forming  In the blockchain world, I see various approaches that are addressing identity and personal security, including granting us access to data and services. Some require new hardware solutions, others are software-based, and some integrate with business-to-business solutions.  They can be broken down as follows:  Hardware. The analogy is similar to showing a passport, or other government-issued identity card, such as driver's license. That card gives us access to travel, or authorizes us to drive a car. On the blockchain, some of these solutions are also combining biometric data to add to the authentication mix. Examples include startups like ShoCard and Case.  Software. The closest analogy is the current OAuth-based identifications we routinely perform on the Web when signing to websites using our Facebook, Twitter or Google IDs. But with blockchain solutions, the roles are reversed: You self-register your identity first, and then you link to your social accounts. Netki, OneName, BitID and Identifi are some startups working in this area.  Integration-first. Whereas the first two approaches generally start with the consumer, this segment starts by figuring out the integration requirements with existing business solutions. Companies interested in this approach are Cambridge Blockchain, Trunomi, uPort, Tradle and Ripple.  Consumer questions  But, when it comes to the implementation and evolution of blockchain solutions, there are a few issues and questions that arise.  For example, it remains unclear which applications will drive these new forms of identity representations.  In the Facebook and Google world, specific applications (eg social media, or documents access) drives our usage. But on the blockchain, most identity solutions providers are rushing to deliver solutions before bolting them onto applications.  Key questions for these applications include:  Can a blockchain solution become our ""digital passport"" as it is already becoming our digital wallet?  What does portability really mean in the context of identity?  What is the role of the smartphone?  What is the role of zero-knowledge technology to protect the confidentiality of transactions and the privacy of individuals?  Will users be willing to self-manage the complexity that comes with higher levels of security rules and access levels?  Business considerations  On the business side, questions pertain to how such services should be offered while respecting the role of regulators.  Key questions for these participants are:  Can the average user be trusted to self-manage access to their data with the same ease as protecting one’s own property at home?  Could we configure information access in more granular way, so that peer-to-peer security rules can supplant firewall-based solutions?  Do we need new types of certificate authorities to provide stamps of approvals on these identity systems?  What happens if we lose our secured card or private keys?  What is the relationship with current know your customer (KYC) practices, and will these new identity solutions provide a more secure layer for facilitating anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism types of activities?  Will this drive more consumer or business applications?  Ethical questions  Changing habits is one of the biggest hurdles to technology adoption, and this area is no different. We don’t know yet if a full move to digital identities would invite some abuse, or decrease friction, and increase total user engagement.  We should ask ourselves:  Does this open-up the market to promote financial inclusion, or does it raise the adoption bar higher?  How about the impact of transaction history on our reputation? Will rating our online reputation become the new consumer credit score equivalent?  Is anonymity a good thing, or can that moniker be abused to achieve malicious goals?  Is the separation of data and identity a good thing? Does it create multiple pseudo identities and personas ad nauseam?  These issues and subjects will be discussed during an upcoming panel session at Consensus 2016, including revealing the latest practical use cases around identity and security layers that are connected to the blockchain.

42426705,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJw9Th,1458307815,Forbes Cover CEO Ola Doudin Talks Building Bitcoin Support in Dubai,"The Middle East isn’t typically considered a hotbed for bitcoin, but that hasn’t stopped entrepreneur Ola Doudin from generating local interest.  The founder of bitcoin wallet and exchange BitOasis, Doudin graced the cover of Forbes Middle East in January in an issue where the startup was ranked 19th on a list of the most promising UAE-based startups.  Doudin was lauded alongside co-founder Daniel Robenek for the firm’s dedication to spreading awareness of the emerging technology in the market. Since then, BitOasis has released a steady stream of updates to its service, offering the ability for users to withdraw bitcoin to bank accounts and launching iPhone and iPad wallets.  However, BitOasis perhaps made its biggest splash internationally last month when it revealed it had completed a proof-of-concept with commodity marketplace tech provider Dubai Multi Commodities Center (DMCC) in what might be the first test of the technology by a major regional financial institution.  The announcement came as part of the unveiling of the Global Blockchain Council (GBC), a 32-member working group of UAE government bodies, international tech firms and blockchain startups led by a government innovation effort called Museum of the Future.  Doudin, whose startup is also a member, described the group as part of a broader initiative by local government officials to better understand the emerging technology.  She told CoinDesk:  ""The whole idea of creating the GBC was to create the umbrella under which regulatory discussions occur to become a bridge or cross-link between the private and public sector that legitimizes the space as a whole. It gives us serious backing and emphasizes that UAE or Dubai regulators need to look at it, that banks need to seriously observe the space.""  Doudin said that local blockchain companies are now benefiting from an initiative called Dubai 2021, a government effort to create a vision for how government services can be better automated in the future.  ""A lot of the public services are automated or self-service, but now they’re trying to integrate all they have in digitizing payments and creating smart payment tools. They have been looking into the blockchain,"" she said.  DMCC trial  As for BitOasis’s work with the DMCC, Doudin said the project was part of a bid by the firm to improve onboarding to its trading system.  Based in the JLT Free Zone, a special economic zone offering tax and customs benefits to businesses, DMCC is described as the only international commodity center in the region. Its main commodity groups including precious metals, diamonds, pearls and tea.  Doudin said that when BitOasis looked at DMCC’s internal processes to find applications for the technology, the firms decided on a trial for how the commodities firm could issue blockchain-based identities to customers.  The trial envisioned that companies could onboard to the DMCC and be issued a digital ID for verification as part of its Flexi Desk offering. Flexi Desk, according to the DMCC, provides businesses with communications services, but Doudin said other opportunities have been discussed.  ""We've also been looking and exploring ways to potentially streamline collection of payments for DMCC and their companies by using the public blockchain,"" Doudin explained.  Doudin added that BitOasis remains focused on its consumer-facing bitcoin services, suggesting that it doesn't see the effort as part of a change in strategy.  BitOasis has five employees, but hopes to grow to as many as eight by the end of the year, she said.  Work ahead  Despite the interest from agencies within the Dubai government, Doudin said that the local startup community remains small.  There are just a few notable blockchain startups, a group which includes BitOasis, YellowPay and Umbrellab, all of whom are involved in the Global Blockchain Council. Doudin is also co-founder and former adviser to bitcoin payment service YellowPay, though she says she is now focused on BitOasis.  ""There are a few people here and there trying to set up stuff, but nothing yet is growing at the same pace,"" she said.  Still, she said user adoption is happening, both in the UAE and in Egypt, where she said local meetups in the country’s capital and largest city are growing.  Doudin herself was instrumental in the formation of the Jordan Bitcoin Group in 2014, a meetup group designed to raise awareness of digital currency in the country.  Now, she said investors are waking up to the opportunity, and that the technology is beginning to lose the stigma of its past association with cybercrime.  Doudin concluded:  ""The interest and awareness of local investors is happening faster than I thought. Investors want to help build a regional strong player, so you can see the awareness.""  Ola Doudin is speaking at Consensus 2016 in New York. Join her at the Marriott Marquis from 2nd to 4th May. A list of the event speakers can be found here.
