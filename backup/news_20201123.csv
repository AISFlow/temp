42385174,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnX3R,1606171575,Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Contract Is 75% Funded Ahead of Dec. 1 Soft Launch,"The smart contract that will trigger the first phase of Ethereum’s most ambitious upgrade yet has nearly accrued enough funds to activate.      The Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract currently holds 385,440 ($231 million) of the requisite 524,288 ETH required to activate Ethereum 2.0’s beacon chain, the central nervous system of the completely rebooted network. This represents roughly 75% of the threshold needed to activate the upgrade.      The Ethereum Foundation set a soft launch date for the new Ethereum network of Dec. 1, so if the deposit contract reaches 100% of the necessary deposits by, for instance, Nov. 24, then the Beacon chain will go live Dec. 1.      The activation event can be triggered after this timeframe as well, so if the deposit contract hits its minimum on Nov. 25, for example, then the Beacon chain will activate on Dec. 2 (or if the threshold is reached by Nov. 26, it will activate on Dec. 3, and so on).    'Not a chance that Eth 2.0 doesn’t launch'    After something of a sluggish start, interest in the deposit contract has grown over recent weeks. Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at blockchain infrastructure service provider Bison Trails, said the tepid start was the result of a “convergence of factors,” including issues with the Medalla testnet and developers pushing later-than-expected updates for Prysm and Lighthouse, Ethereum 2.0’s primary software implementations.      Addressing one of the main criticisms against the deposit contract, Bunin said that while some users may be put off by the one-way nature of staking ETH in the contract (once ETH goes into Ethereum 2.0, it can’t come out), he said that “by and large the community is extremely excited to launch Eth 2.0.”      “There’s not a chance that Eth 2.0 doesn’t launch,” Bunin told CoinDesk. “Eth 2.0 is a vision. It is a drive to improve Ethereum to scale support for the entire planet. Even if this launch is not successful for some reason, you can be sure that the community will learn from it and try, and try, again.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/23/ethereum-20-deposit-contract-is-75-funded-ahead-of-dec-1-soft-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d5ffc263f41b43d1d3db3e8d13920614edafa06-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385197,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnXNZ,1606167705,OKEx’s Withdrawal Suspension Isn’t Behind Bitcoin’s Rally: Analysts,"Bitcoin’s price has been up dramatically since the very day popular exchange OKEx announced the suspension of all crypto withdrawal service on its platform. However, while some tie the two together, many market observers do not see a reason to associate the latest price rally with OKEx’s issues.      While the price of bitcoin gained significantly since the market sell-off in March, the most recent bullish run began just as OKEx said it suspended all crypto withdrawals because one of its key holders has “been out of touch.”      However, the suspension of withdrawals on OKEx had little impact on bitcoin’s price over the past month, said Ki Young Ju, chief executive officer of CryptoQuant.      “BTC's price on OKEx is not that different from other exchanges,” he said. “...[P]eople can trade their BTC on OKEx despite the withdrawal suspension.”      The Malta-based crypto exchange still remains the No. 1 position for bitcoin futures open interest, currently worth $1.22 billion, according to data source Skew.      OKEx said Thursday it will resume withdrawal service as soon as this week, after founder Mingxing “Star” Xu was said to have been released from police custody in China. Jay Hao, chief executive officer of OKEx, told CoinDesk its high open interest is a positive indicator for his company.      “These are encouraging signs that confidence in the exchange remains high and I believe that even if some users decide to withdraw their funds [as soon as withdrawals are open], which is their total and absolute right, they will soon come back to OKEx,” Hao said through a spokesperson on Telegram.    Decreased Chinese miners’ impact on prices    Bitcoin’s volume from miners to OKEx has also dropped to almost zero since the news came out, as data from Glassnode show.      The muted bitcoin transfer volume from miners to OKEx, whose users are largely Chinese, is in line with the argument that the price surge is partly due to drying up in supply. Miners in China are struggling to turn their bitcoin into cash because of a government crackdown on Chinese exchanges.      Darius Sit, founder of Singapore-based trading firm QCP, connects the situation for miners in China with the market, telling CoinDesk that instead of going to other platforms, miners may have been holding on to their bitcoins as prices continue to climb, causing a tightened bitcoin supply.      Yet, others have largely disagreed with such contentions, saying the supply of bitcoin affected by OKEx’s withdrawal suspension is relatively small.      “As a class, miners aren’t that large a group of sellers,” Ryan Watkins, bitcoin analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “[They are] definitely not enough to drive the price up as high as it is.”      Instead, Watkins pointed out the recent bitcoin rally is mostly driven by the demand side, as institutional investors in North America have been buying bitcoin in large amounts.      The “perfect” timing of OKEx’s suspension and the price rally could be purely coincidental, Watkins added.      Data from Chainalysis also indicate that after mining pools stopped sending bitcoin to OKEx, their newly minted cryptocurrency instead flowed to Binance and Huobi, both of which are also widely used in China.      Binance, Huobi and OKEx in total received 46% of bitcoin sent to exchanges from mining pools in the past 12 months, according to a Nov. 12 report from Chainalysis.      Colin Wu, a journalist based in China who first reported the Chinese miners’ selling problem in his blog, told CoinDesk in a WeChat message that Western media outlets have largely “exaggerated” what he wrote, saying the difficulties Chinese miners have had selling bitcoin should have had a minor impact on the recent price rally.      “The misunderstanding is that Chinese miners stopped selling coins and caused bitcoin to rise, which is illogical,” Wu wrote in a tweet thread. “They did not stop selling coins. … It was just a little troublesome and the number of miners in China has been decreasing. Miners are moving to the United States and Kazakhstan.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/23/okexs-withdrawal-suspension-isnt-behind-bitcoins-rally-analysts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d34572af15f53964e4f174b2f2b65ceece5176e-1500x941.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Read More: Bitcoin Faces Volatility Rise as Futures Market Shows Signs of Overheating      It appeared that more traders were hitting the sell button given the world’s oldest cryptocurrency’s volatility Monday.      “Most likely, we will touch the $19,000 mark before the start of a correction,” noted Constantin Kogan, managing partner at Wave Financial.      Another week has begun with higher-than-normal USD/BTC spot volumes, a factor that led to bitcoin’s bullish run last week. As of press time, daily volume hit $907 million, much higher than the past month’s daily average of $489 million.      “A pullback just below the all-time high is not unexpected and it will be even healthy,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at quant trading firm ExoAlpha. ”We could see bitcoin moving sideways from here in a $18,000-$19,000 range or perhaps even pull back to $16,000 before trying a new reach at the all-time high.”      Bitcoin’s record high price is $19,783 set on Nov. 4, 2017, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Analysts are keeping an eye on China-based crypto flows to help indicate where price might be heading. China-focused exchange OKEx, for example, has had no outflows since Oct. 16 following the halting of withdrawals. Since then, bitcoin’s price has soared to over $18,000 from $11,500 while OKEx users have not been able to withdraw any crypto from the exchange.      Darius Sit, managing partner of quaint firm QCP Capital. said OXEx “possibly contributed” to the price rise, but a bigger problem has been cropping up on the mainland. “It’s not just OKEx but across the board – difficulties with getting fiat"" out of China, Sit added.      “The OKEx story is just weird,” said George Clayton, managing partner of investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital. OKEx is ""huge, but with all of the institutional flow around crypto, I don't think the status of any single exchange is enough to affect prices beyond typical daily volatility.”      Read More: PayPal CEO Schulman Say He’s Bullish on Bitcoin as a Currency      Indeed, it is possible that institutional investors, who have been piling in, may help absorb any problems China-based crypto businesses may have. The derivatives market is a sign of this, as bitcoin futures hit $7 billion in open interest Sunday, with institutional venue CME at $1 billion.      “It's important to remember there’s a large chunk of institutional money moving in and not as much retail,” noted Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “So we’re seeing a more structured move higher here, which should continue for a while yet.”    BTC, ETH correlation breaking    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Monday trading around $595 and climbing 5.3% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Since Nov. 20, the price of bitcoin has been relatively stagnate, up only 3% as of press time.      The price of ether is up over 25% during the same time period.      According to data from CoinDesk Research, returns of bitcoin and ether were highly correlated in March, April and May on a 90-day rolling basis – even before the early March sell-off that took its toll on assets across the board. However, since June, correlations have mostly been lower.      Some investors attribute the recent ether price run separate from bitcoin to the Ethereum network’s plan to shift to “2.0”. Ether holders must “stake” at least 32 ETH in the new network’s smart contract, which is currently around 65% of the over 524,000 ETH balance required to launch.      “This current run I largely attribute to the excitement around the pending launch of Ethereum 2.0, the much-anticipated Ethereum network upgrade,” said Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital. “It's been years in development, and I think a lot of the discounted price was a reflection of the market's uncertainty if Ethereum 2.0 would ever launch or if a competitor smart contract platform would steal mindshare.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Monday.

42385191,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnXIX,1606164976,Biden to Tap Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary,"Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is set to become the next head of the U.S. Treasury Department.      President-elect Joe Biden intends to nominate the longtime economist to succeed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when Biden takes office next year, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Any nominee would have to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.      Yellen was seen as one of three frontrunners to get the nod, the Washington Post said, along with Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard and former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson. Yellen ran the U.S. central bank between 2014 and 2018, during a period of relatively low inflation.      While she’s said in the past that she’s not a huge fan of bitcoin, Yellen is on record as saying she believes the U.S. financial regulators should allow blockchain and cryptocurrency projects to develop, saying in 2015 the Fed and other regulators might have “limited authority” over digital currency systems.      Two years later, she said blockchain is an important “new technology that could have implications for the way in which transactions are handled throughout the financial system.” Still, she’s been less interested in bitcoin itself, saying in 2018 that few transactions might be conducted using bitcoin and a majority of those might be illegal, in her view.      She’s also known within the crypto community for a 2017 hearing in which Christian Langalis wrote “buy bitcoin” on a legal pad and flashed it at a camera while she was testifying.      As Treasury Secretary, Yellen could shape how some of the financial regulators approach crypto. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are all bureaus within the Treasury Department’s purview.      It’s unclear how Yellen might view the crypto space at present.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/23/biden-to-tap-former-fed-chair-janet-yellen-as-treasury-secretary,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c59fee37e52f01063952221d4e7f94cab629b1fd-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As proof, they cited the growing size in Q4 of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, whose customers are mostly institutional.  In Q3, retail customers bought $1.6 billion worth of bitcoin using Square’s Cash App, some three times more than what was invested in Grayscale’s bitcoin product.  This quarter, however, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is at three times its Q3 numbers. There is no data at present for Square customers’ bitcoin buys.  Grayscale Investments is a digital asset management firm owned by venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG), which also owns CoinDesk.

42385185,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnXCF,1606154351,"Privacy, Power, Fiscal Policy, the Poor: 4 Reasons to Worry About CBDCs","It has become clear by now that central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, will be in our future and the technology will fundamentally change the use of money and the economic system as a whole.      The world’s biggest economies and their central banks have announced they are working on CBDCs: the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank are trailing behind the People’s Bank of China, which already is testing its CBDC with more than 50,000 citizens. The Bahamas issued its central bank digital currency – the “sand dollar” – in October.    Dr. Wolf von Laer is the CEO of Students For Liberty, an international educational non-profit operating in over 100 countries. He holds a Ph.D. in Political Economy from King’s College London and a Master’s in Austrian Economics from Universidad Rey Juan Carlos.    CBDCs promise faster settlements, better security, ease of use, instant implementation of monetary policy (if you consider that an improvement) and transaction costs that are lower than cash. In the future, these advantages will be stressed ad nauseam by pundits and politicians to make the technology palatable to the whole population.      While all of the advantages are true, it is also crucial to think through the implication of the technology and how it could negatively affect the economy and the citizenry. There are different types of CBDCs with varying degrees of risks, and it's important to understand the subtleties of these systems. However, all CBDCs need to be centralized and manipulatable to some extent because otherwise monetary policy would not be possible.      As a contrast, Bitcoin is booming due to its decentralized, open, public, borderless, neutral and tamper and censorship-resistant properties. Depending on the type of CBDC, CBDCs can become the exact opposite, especially if central banks offer accounts to the public at large, implementing what is known as a direct model of CBDC.      This article outlines four scenarios of how CBDCs have the potential to undermine economic stability and eradicate privacy.    Centralizing power in the economic system    Governments are fallible. In the U.S., think back to the launch of healthcare.gov or federal- and state-level breaches involving sensitive data in more than 300 million cases in the last 10 years. With CBDCs, the whole economic system could be brought to the brink by bad updates or data leaks of the centralized ledger, which won’t be protected by proof-of-work in the same way as Bitcoin. For Bitcoin, it took a decade to build a robust decentralized computing power to assure the integrity of the blockchain. Governments won’t go to such lengths, and they need to rely on different, more fragile ways of protecting the centralized ledger.    CBDCs = a dystopian nightmare    Government tends to collect as much data about its citizens as they can get away with. This happens under the guise of safety, as in the governor of the state of Michigan’s decree to document every customer’s personal information to contain the spread of COVID-19 or under the pretext of nudging people to become model citizens in the case of China. Imagine a social credit scoring system coupled with a CBDC. All your purchasing decisions could influence your score on which you depend for everything. Donate to the “wrong” non-profit like WikiLeaks? Whoops, you cannot purchase train tickets anymore. Bought some interesting adult toys for your spouse? Oh no, your credit score might drop, or your application for the government job does not get accepted.      What sounds like a far-fetched dystopian nightmare is already a reality in China. If you hang out with the wrong crowd, your citizen score, which is crucial for purchases, jobs, travel and so much more suffers. Pair this level of surveillance with the ability to track any purchasing decision you make and you have the perfect recipe for Big Brother on crypto-steroids.    End to the informal economy    More than 60% of all jobs around the world operate in the informal economy. This results from the lack of free-market institutions like the rule of law, property rights and stable money in many developing countries. But even in developed countries like the U.S., the informal economy plays a huge role. Here the International Labor Organization estimates there are at least 30 million jobs that rely on the informal market. That's a lot of livelihoods threatened by CBDCs. The informal economy includes innocuous things like paying your neighbor to fix your roof or paying a teenager to take care of your yard.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      Many activities we all engage in fall within the informal economy, and they are efficient. They make life easier, they overcome useless red tape and they save money. The government does not like this because it cannot generate tax revenue. Having a government ledger that tracks every transaction would make it virtually impossible to do anything within the informal economy, and a huge chunk of the 30 million jobs would vanish. A CBDC paves the way for a cashless society, which is very much in the government's interest. Thus, it could be the end of informal markets, which are often a safe haven for many people in light of an ever-expanding regulatory state.    Central banks and fiscal policy    Admittedly, the pandemic has made central banks' work almost in unison with fiscal policy. Governments “stimulate” the economy like never before. Of course, they run massive deficits doing that. Due to depressed interest rates, bond yields are historically low and demand for bonds is low. Normally, what happens? Governments would not issue as much debt. But governments do not have to worry if there is infinite demand produced at the push of a button by the Fed. The Fed predominantly buys all of the new debt and then some in secondary markets. This is an indirect monetization of government debt.      Now, CBDCs could completely do away with fiscal policy. Central banks could immediately generate cash and hand it out to small and medium-sized businesses. People with higher savings could get higher interest rates than the ones who do not save. Fiscal stimulus and a multi-layered interest rate approach are all possible when the government has all of your financial data. Governments will argue this is highly beneficial. Still, it bears the danger of manipulation, economic mismanagement and leads to an even faster monetization of government debt, the cost of which we all have to face by holding money with less and less purchasing power.      There are many more reasons to be wary of CBDCs, but I hope this article encourages you to think through this technology’s effects and what it means for you and your future.

The newly launched GnosisDAO will allow Gnosis users to vote on platform governance and development.      Gnosis CEO Martin Köppelmann told CoinDesk the DAO’s voting proposals ""can be really wide-reaching: product roadmap decisions, treasury management, starting new ventures, funding public goods. DAOs open up a large space for collaboration and experimentation.""      One of GnosisDAO’s key marketing points is its integration with the Gnosis prediction markets. Because any protocol change will have an associated prediction market where traders are betting on its impact, Gnosis users can judge a proposal based on the market’s attitude (whether traders overall think it’s good or bad for Gnosis).      Read more: Ethereum Gas Fees Drive Gnosis-Powered Prediction Market to xDai’s Layer 2    Futarchy: Testing governance with prediction markets    This governance model, called futarchy, was formulated by George Mason University economist Robin Hanson. Futarchy proposes the efficacy of democratically elected officials or policies should be tested by prediction markets; in other words, prediction markets create a barometer for success or failure of policies, which voters can then consult to augment their decision-making.      “People can influence [a vote] with their trading decision. As a new proposal is on the table, people can already signal whether they would buy or sell the token (GNO) if the proposal was implemented. It is basically the most direct way to ask ‘the market’ for feedback on a proposal,” Köppelmann told CoinDesk.      Gnosis will bootstrap these markets using funding from Gnosis’ treasury of 150K ETH and 8 million Gnosis tokens (GNO). At launch, the Gnosis treasury will allocate 1,000 ETH and 20,000 GNO into the GnosisDAO’s prediction markets.      The DAO will launch with three proposals: one that creates a template for Gnosis Improvement Proposals (GIPs), one that establishes a governance token for the DAO called SAFE and one that distributes a one-time reward to early DAO participants.      Köppelmann told CoinDesk the votes are indeed weighted by ""how many [GNO] tokens you have.” But voters can also ignore the prediction markets and vote however they want on a proposal.      Given that voters can go against the direction of the markets, GnosisDAO will be launching with a softer futarchy bent that may harden as the DAO grows.      “We are not going all in on futarchy on day 1,” Köppelmann said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | GMO,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/23/new-gnosisdao-bets-on-futarchy-a-prediction-market-governance-model,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dffee9edeeca7f93bb1042c61b3782e2281d252-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405459,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMYr2,1606151624,"Blockchain Bites: XRP's Rally, Chainalysis' $1B Valuation, Bitcoin's Volatility in Perspective","The U.S. government is using Circle's USDC to bypass Venezuelan blockades. Chainalaysis is looking to raise $100 million in fresh capital at a $1 billion valuation. Billions of dollars from institutional players are flowing into Coinbase. And VanEck found that bitcoin is less volatile than a quarter of S&P500 stocks, reigniting the case for a bitcoin ETF.    Top shelf    Injecting “stability” An unnamed U.S. government agency has enlisted dollar-backed stablecoin provider Circle and P2P payments startup Airtm to support Venezuelan politician Juan Guaidó’s bid for office. The plan is to distribute relief funds to medical workers and other Venezuelan locals, bypassing restrictions set up by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was re-elected in a 2018 election, by converting U.S. seized funds into Circle’s USDC product and dispersed via Airtm’s mobile phone network. “This is, in a sense, a way to bypass the state-controlled banking system and just directly distribute to people,” Circle’s Jeremy Allaire said, adding this is likely the first U.S. foreign policy objective utilizing a cryptographic stablecoin.      Private eyes Chainalysis expects to raise $100 million venture capital at a $1 billion valuation in a fast-approaching Series C. Led by VC newcomer Addition with participation expected from Accel, Benchmark and Ribbit, the round could propel the blockchain analysis startup to unicorn status (a rarity for crypto). Several governments, banks, regulators and crypto firms rely on Chainalysis technology, seen in the company’s financial status: The firm increased its customer base 65% from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020. In other blockchain sleuthing news, analytics firm Coinfirm found government agents frequently leave behind ""substantial” amounts of forked cryptos in seized wallets. Finally, CipherTrace has filed for two patents related to sniffing out privacy-preserving monero (XMR) transactions.      Open banking The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a national bank regulator led by former Coinbase counsel Brian Books, has proposed a rule that would forbid banks to blacklist legal, but unsavory businesses – potentially including crypto firms. Under the proposed rule, banks could deny financial services to customers only on the basis of “quantitative, risk-based standards established in advance,” not in response to political pressures. Crypto firms have long struggled to obtain or keep bank accounts in the U.S., with only a handful of friendly providers – namely, Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank, and Metropolitan Commercial Bank. The proposal is open for public comment through Jan. 4.      $20B BTC Coinbase now custodies $20 billion in institutional assets, an exchange executive claims. Brett Tejpaul said the institutional assets business was under $6 billion when he joined the firm in April and has grown by $14 billion under his watch. Notably, Tejpaul pointed to Coinbase’s Tagomi acquisition in May as a boost. “It radically transformed our ability to cater to institutional clients that want to use smart order routing and algorithmic execution,” he said. The veteran banker also said that adding JPMorgan Chase as its banking partner and Deloitte as its auditor has given Coinbase more compliance credibility. The firm is now measuring new capital coming in for bitcoin in the billions, Tejpaul said.      CBDCs not crypto? China Construction Bank (CCB), the world’s second-largest bank, has suspended the upcoming listing of a $3 billion bond issuance that was intended to be tradable for bitcoin and U.S. dollars. The bank was sponsoring the issuance of the Longbond debt securities, set to be traded via the Fusang digital asset exchange. Now the program is being re-evaluated. In other news out of China, the city of Suzhou will hold the second lottery of the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) next month (this time with additional features like smart touch payments.) This follows on China’s President Xi Jinping comments at the G20 that CBDCs are to be embraced by developed nations.    Quick bites  YER ORANGES: Sean Ono Lennon, musician and younger son of Beatles legend John Lennon, appeared on the Orange Pill Podcast on Sunday to say bitcoin is a tool for empowerment and among a few optimistic developments for “the future and humanity in general.”  UP & RUNNING: KuCoin, the Singapore-headquartered digital asset exchange that was hacked to the tune of $281 million in September, said it has restored the deposit and withdrawal services of all tokens as of Sunday.  DOMAIN BREACH: Cryptocurrency trading platform liquid.com and crypto mining firm NiceHash were two of at least six firms that had control of their domains briefly transferred to malicious actors last week after employees at GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar, were tricked by fraudsters.  YOU GOTTA BE GERKIN ME?! Popular decentralized finance protocol Pickle Finance was hacked on Saturday, draining $19.7 million in DAI, a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, from Pickle’s latest arbitraging smart contract.  MOVING IMAGE: A programmable painting of Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin set records this weekend when “EthBoy” sold for 260 ETH (ETH, +12.69%). The painting utilizes new cryptographic tooling to refashion itself everyday based on a bevy of market and community data.  Market intel    Leveraged buyers Some BTC traders may have become overleveraged during the recent rally above $18,000, according to one key metric. The average level of the “funding rate” across major exchanges has risen sharply from 0.023% to a five-month high of 0.087% in the past 48 hours, according to data source Glassnode. The funding rate reflects the cost of holding long positions – measured by the premium derivative plays pay over spot prices. A higher number indicates excessively bullish, and therefore overbought, conditions. In such situations, a pullback or consolidation can trigger an unwinding of longs, leading to a deeper drop and a pick up in price volatility.      XRP pumps XRP, the native asset of the XRP ledger, is riding 16-month highs. On Saturday the third-largest crypto by market cap climbed to $0.437564, the highest price since July 2019, according to the CoinDesk 20. It has continued to rise, with minor contractions, since. Now above the $0.50 level, XRP has appreciated over 120% since the start of the year.    At stake    Volatility, market data and ETFs A new analysis from VanEck, a major investment management firm, found that bitcoin is less volatile than the S&P’s benchmark stock index.      The report, published Nov. 20, compared BTC to the companies listed on the S&P 500, finding the cryptocurrency was less volatile than 22% of these stocks over the past three months.      “Historically, bitcoin has been discussed in the news and among investors as a nascent and volatile asset outside of the traditional stock and capital markets,” the report reads. VanEck attributed this volatility to bitcoin’s relatively small total market size, regulatory blockers and limited participation from traditional asset managers.      But bitcoin’s volatility is not an aberration, as over the 90-day period measured ending Nov. 13 some 112 stocks experienced as much or more price volatility. Further, over the past year, 29% of S&P stocks were more volatile than bitcoin.      As CoinDesk Director of Research Noelle Acheson noted in a September newsletter, volatility is frequently and erroneously conflated with risk.      “Volatility is a metric, a number, a measurement. Risk is an ambiguous concept,” she writes, adding that volatility can be an attractive attribute for a well-weighted portfolio.      In Acheson’s analysis, she found bitcoin volatility is often correlated with the asset’s price direction: That is, when the price comes down, so usually does the volatility.      In comparison, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the S&P 500 implied volatility, tends to move inversely to the S&P 500. “The average 60-day correlation between the two for the month of August was -0.84, an almost perfect negative association. Using bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility as a proxy for a bitcoin VIX, we get an average 60-day correlation for August of 0.45. A very different scenario,” she found.      What’s more, bitcoin’s volatility is more measurable than traditional markets, as the crypto trades 24/7 freely across the world. More data points means more data to analyze.      It’s for these reasons, bitcoin’s similar volatility and market information, that many feel comfortable for agitating for a BTC exchange-traded fund. As reported, U.S. regulators have been hesitant to accept crypto ETF products, often citing a lack of cohesive market data.      But a sober look at the real market conditions may point the other way.      VanEck ends its report saying: “While there are no U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available today, we believe such products may show similar volatility characteristics – based on the comparison above – as many stocks in well-known indices and ETFs, such as the S&P 500 and related products.”    Food for thought",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/23/blockchain-bites-xrps-rally-chainalysis-1b-valuation-bitcoins-volatility-in-perspective,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e2433f801a7e1df4eeade7de979dc984214038d-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405460,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMYs1,1606145392,"First Mover: Near Record Highs, Bitcoin May Have a Volatile Week","Bitcoin is trading above $18,500, having charted a minor pullback to $17,800 over the weekend. The cryptocurrency's one-month implied volatility metric has jumped to four-month highs, suggesting increased expectations for price turbulence over the next four weeks.      ""It's likely the week ahead is filled with volatility with the possibility of a trading range between $19,000 and $17,000 the likely outcome. However, if the bulls take charge, then we could be discussing new all-time highs for BTC,"" noted crypto exchange EQUOS in its daily bitcoin analysis email.      In traditional markets, safe havens such as the U.S. dollar and gold are trading heavily alongside stock market gains. Risk appetite has been boosted by more positive news on the coronavirus vaccine front, this time from AstraZeneca and Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed. ""Vaccinations against COVID-19 will 'hopefully' start in less than three weeks,"" Slaoui said on Sunday.    Market moves    Hindsight is 20/20.      That said, when it comes to bitcoin this year, some of the biggest names in global finance were WRONG and LOSERS, as (lame duck?) U.S. President Donald Trump might put it.      JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, Bridgewater Associates CEO Ray Dalio, Goldman Sachs. All of these Wall Street titans steered investors away from the largest cryptocurrency this year as its price soared more than 150%.      They were on the wrong side of the market while just-as-big traditional-finance names including Fidelity Investments, Paul Tudor Jones II, Stanley Druckenmiller, Bloomberg Intelligence and now the $7 trillion money manager BlackRock touted bitcoin’s potential as the future of money, a hedge against inflation, a peer-to-payment system, an alternative to the U.S. dollar or merely a speculative investment.      Even if bitcoin’s price once again plunged 39%, as it did in March when the deep economic toll of the coronavirus became clear to global investors (before the Federal Reserve bailed out financial markets), the price would still be roughly $11,370, up some 59% from the Dec. 31, 2019, price of $7,168. For comparison, the Standard & Poor’s 500 is up 11% this year and gold has gained 24%.      Few of the biggest banks and brokerage firms even had bitcoin on their radar at the start of this calamitous year. Some investors came around to the concept sooner than others.      In just 11 years, bitcoin has gone from nothing to an awe-inspiring creator of wealth. At this point, whether prices go to the moon or stagnate or correct, the cryptocurrency is becoming impossible to ignore in an increasingly dysfunctional global financial and monetary system.      – Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    There seems to be no stopping the bitcoin freight train.      The cryptocurrency jumped over 15% in the seven days leading up to Nov. 22 to register its biggest weekly gain since October 2019. That was also the seventh straight weekly rise.      What's more, prices ended last week (Sunday, UTC) above $18,400 – the second-highest weekly close on record. Bitcoin is now just 6.5% short of challenging the record high of $19,783 reached in December 2017.      A move to record highs could easily happen in a matter of a few hours, given the recent strong momentum.      That said, a metric from bitcoin's perpetual futures market now suggests the market is getting excessively skewed to the bullish side and could experience a rise in volatility.      The average level of the “funding rate” across major exchanges has risen sharply from 0.023% to a five-month high of 0.087% in the past 48 hours, according to data source Glassnode.      “Rising funding rates have in the past been associated with a larger portion of the market utilizing leverage via perpetuals,” Matthew Dibb, CEO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. ""The high funding rate can cause somewhat of a ‘shakeout’ due to increasing margin liquidations.""      So far, pullbacks have been shallow and restricted near the ascending 10-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $17,640. As such, the SMA line is a key support to watch out for in the short-term. Bitcoin has immediate resistance at $19,000, followed by the record high of $19,783.      – Omkar Godbole    What's hot  Crypto Long & Short: 4 Metrics That Show How the Current Bitcoin Rally Is Different From 2017 (CoinDesk)  John Lennon’s Son Says Bitcoin ‘Empowers’ People Like Never Before (CoinDesk)  China to Hold Second Lottery Trial of the Digital Yuan (CoinDesk)  CipherTrace Says Homeland Security Work Gave Rise to Monero-Tracking Patent Filings (CoinDesk)  Bitcoin Is the Biggest Big Short (CoinDesk)  China Construction Bank Pulls Planned Listing of Bitcoin-Tradable Bond (CoinDesk)  Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance  Vaccine developments keep dollar down; Kiwi hits two-year high (Reuters) Risk appetite in currency markets was boosted by progress towards a COVID-19 vaccine rollout even as PMI data showed a sharp contraction in euro zone business activity as a result of lockdown restrictions.

42405454,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMYm7,1606143697,Latin America's Big Blockchain Opportunity,"When I lived in Chile during the 2000s, I would bring a book to the bank because there was always a one-hour wait just to talk to a teller. Registering a mortgage for a makeshift dwelling in Rocinha (a favela in Rio de Janeiro) was a seemingly impossible task, as there were no formal ways to secure title for illegal settlements on invaded land. Returning defective products to a department store in Peru remains a Kafka-esque exercise involving documents and stamps and an excruciating process that might as well have included a body cavity search.      It is not surprising that Latin America and the Caribbean have long been left behind economically, eternally dependent on the industrialized, developed north. In 2008’s ""Falling Behind,"" Francis Fukuyama brought together scholars to unpack the reasons why the economic gap between Latin America and the United States had grown so wide when in the year 1700 they were so similarly situated. The authors determined that poor public policy choices – including state-based investment and other government interventions – were, in part, to blame.    James Cooper is Associate Dean, Experiential Learning and Professor of Law at California Western School of Law in San Diego. He has advised governments around the Americas on disruptive technologies in the judicial sector for over two decades.    Economic nationalism, undertaken through import substitution, strict capital controls and stifling regulation, made financial institutions lethargic, their balance sheets anemic and their service ethic customer-unfriendly, the group decided. Banks, insurance firms, consumer credit institutions and cooperative agencies of Latin America have long suffered with such inefficiencies, and have faced runs on accounts during economic unstable times as well as hyper-inflation and massive thefts of account holders’ deposits.      It is no wonder that several Latin American countries resisted for so long joining the World Trade Organization and entering into bilateral or multilateral trade agreements with the United States. It was protectionism, mixed with a dash of fear of foreign competition and a sprinkle of cronyism.      In 2001, the Peruvian sociologist Hernando de Soto posited that reducing bureaucracy (such as registering land titles) and regularizing businesses could unleash trillions of dollars of investment throughout the developing world. By ending decades of state intervention in the economies and opening society to market economics, he argued, states could enjoy economies of scale, growth through competition and other benefits that often come with market liberalization.      A few states – Carlos Menem’s Argentina, Augusto Pinochet’s Chile and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada’s Bolivia to name a few – did implement these market-friendly reforms and grew their economies to varying levels of success. What they all had in common was the privatization of public services, free-floating their respective currencies and reducing tariff and other trade barriers.    Regularizing businesses could unleash trillions of dollars of investment throughout the developing world    Blockchain technology is the natural next step in this process. And the forgotten continent is a perfect proving ground. By decentralizing the financial sector and putting trust in distributed ledgers, there will be less need for traditional, inefficient and corrupt intermediaries like the financial services behemoths that that have long mismanaged the economy and injured depositors’ interests.      Blockchain scholars rightfully view Latin America and the Caribbean as a complex patchwork of finance cultures and challenges. Settle Network, operating in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil – the economic powerhouses of the region – sees the potential of moving remittances, registering land titles, and facilitating payments for the massive regional communities of unbanked and underbanked. Chile’s Kibernum provides blockchain solutions for the private and public sectors and is committed to corporate social responsibility, a luxury for many companies barely scratching out a living there. Kibernum’s Marko Knezovic sees an opportunity for blockchain to forge a new constitution in Chile, a process that “should be highly transparent and immutable.”      In the Caribbean, the Bahamas has adopted blockchain technology with its new Sand Dollar, making it the first country in the world to deploy a central bank digital currency. The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States is following suit as part of its Digital Transformation Project, sponsored by the World Bank. The regional group’s Eastern Caribbean Central Bank seeks to increase access to digital finance through a blockchain-enabled digital common currency.      Even Haiti, the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country, is getting into the action. Karl Seelig of Digital Davos and ChainBLX is providing the blockchain technology and investment platform for the Andre Berto Fund and its gold mining operations “investing in building multiple dimensional economies, fighting the exploitation of labor.” This means supply chain tracking to ensure no child labor is used and a micro payment system to undergird more equitable economic growth.      Latin America and the Caribbean remain the most unequal continent in the world. But with blockchain solutions, some of the region’s historic dependency and underdevelopment can be undone. At the very least, some of the long waits in line for bank services, to pay an energy bill or to obtain a government license can be avoided.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,James Cooper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/23/latin-americas-big-blockchain-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22c6063965aed5c4ee3fc3047f0061ec5d684e60-2250x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a blog post Friday, Coinfirm said it has found ""substantial funds"" left in wallets by government agencies that may still be accessible by criminals.  The post cites as an example the recent seizure by the U.S. Justice Department of over $1 billion in bitcoin said to have been hacked from defunct dark market Silk Road.  An anonymous character, ""Individual X,"" is said to have helped the DoJ obtain access to the wallet and in return walked away with no charges.  However, Coinfirm said it tracked the funds to other wallets for cryptocurrencies that were forked from bitcoin and found that these funds have not been seized.  Forking is when a blockchain splits into two different versions, sometimes creating a new cryptocurrency in the process.  Coinfirm said it had found wallets related to the Silk Road assets for the forked coins bitcoin private, bitcoin diamond and super bitcoin, which together contain a total of $387,000 in those cryptocurrencies.  ""Whoever has access to the private keys of the main wallet, would still have access to these funds,"" Coinfirm said.  The company said it has further found ""dozens of cases"" in which authorities may have left funds accessible to suspects ""instead of properly accounting for and seizing those assets.""

The average level of the ""funding rate"" across major exchanges has risen sharply from 0.023% to a five-month high of 0.087% in the past 48 hours, according to data source Glassnode.      ""Rising funding rates have in the past been associated with a larger portion of the market utilizing leverage via perpetuals,"" Matthew Dibb, CEO of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. ""If we see continued overleveraging in the derivatives market, bitcoin will be increasingly volatile in the short term.""      Calculated every eight hours, the funding rate in effect reflects the cost of holding long positions. The metric is used by exchanges offering perpetuals (futures contracts with no expiry) as a mechanism to balance the market and guide perpetual prices toward the spot price.      The funding rate is positive (or longs pay shorts) when perpetuals trade at a premium to the spot price. As such, a very high funding rate is widely considered a sign of leverage being excessively skewed to the bullish side, or overbought conditions, as noted on Twitter by market analyst Joseph Young.      In such situations, a pullback or consolidation can trigger an unwinding of longs, leading to a deeper drop and a pick up in price volatility. ""The high funding rate can cause somewhat of a 'shakeout' due to increasing margin liquidations,"" Dibb said. Holding longs at elevated costs is attractive only if a bull run continues without pauses.      Historical data validates Dibb's analysis of the market.      Bitcoin's rally from July lows near $9,000 ran out of steam near $12,400 on Aug. 17 as the average funding rate surged from 0.008% to 0.078%. The cryptocurrency fell back to $10,000 in early September.      Similarly, the recovery rally from March lows below $4,000 ran out of steam near $10,000 in early June with a sudden rise of the funding rate to 0.123%.      While the funding rate has risen in the past 48 hours, it's still short of the peak seen in June.      Further, the uptick may have been partly fueled by liquidity providers hedging sell positions in the spot market by buying long positions in the futures/perpetuals, according to Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG. In other words, the latest rise in funding rates may not be entirely retail-driven.      Also read: Crypto Long & Short: 4 Metrics That Show How the Current Bitcoin Rally Is Different From 2017      Nevertheless, the metric's rise calls for caution on the part of the bulls, as it represents overleveraged or overbought conditions. ""It's a first indication that leveraged [traders] are starting to shoot over the target,"" Heusser told CoinDesk.      Bitcoin's implied volatility is already rising with the one-month gauge currently hovering at 77%, the highest level since July 8, according to data source Skew. That means the options market is pricing in a rise in volatility over the next four weeks and looks to be preparing for a temporary disruption to the steep rally.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading close to $18,650, having tested dip demand with a drop to levels below $18,000 over the weekend.

According to an announcement on Friday, the firm most recently filed a document titled ""Techniques and Probabilistic Methods for Tracing Monero"" as a follow up to the earlier ""Systems and Methods for Investigating Monero"" patent application – both arising from the firm's work with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that began in 2019.      The filings provide technical concepts for forensic tools allowing exploration of XMR transaction flows in financial investigations.      While monero, the 16th largest cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap, sets out to offer users more anonymous and private transactions, it is supported by 45% of darknet markets and is favored by criminals for the same properties, the company said.      See also: Inside Chainalysis’ Multimillion-Dollar Relationship With the US Government      According to the firm, the patents will lay the ""groundwork for future implementation"" of entity transaction clustering. Additionally, they provide wallet identification and exchange attribution that would give law enforcement ""even more tools"" for investigating criminal activity using XMR.      ""Built-in obfuscation techniques are what draw in privacy advocates and criminals alike,"" according to the announcement.
