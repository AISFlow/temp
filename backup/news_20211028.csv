The sovereign nation had made history as the first to officially implement bitcoin as a legal tender back in September. To mark the historical moment, President Nayik Bukele had announced that the country had bought 200 bitcoins. A promise to purchase more followed the purchased and the country had kept to that promise. The country had purchased an additional 250 bitcoins after this. The third buy-in in September brought the total of El Salvador&apos;s holdings to 700 coins. At each of these stages, President Nayib Bukele has referred to the purchases as &apos;buying the dip.&apos; These have proven to be the case as the country of El Salvador is currently in profit with its BTC holdings. El Salvador Buys 420 BTC Since the price of bitcoin hit a new peak in October, the value of the asset had been on a downtrend. A number of small dips had seen the price pushed below $60K again. El Salvador has taken this as an opportunity to increase its BTC holdings while the broader market is more conservative. In line with the previous sentiment, the president tweeted that the country had once again &apos;bought the dip.&apos; Related Reading | Bitcoin Exchange Balances Decline To Three-Year Low Amid Rising Prices A follow-up tweet from the president hours later confirmed that the country was now in profit from its recently purchased bitcoins.

42375930,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwD3C5,1635453411,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Heads to $61K Ahead of Options Expiry,"Bitcoin rose toward $61,000 on Thursday, albeit within a choppy trading range. Analysts have mixed views about the short-term direction of BTC’s price, which is up about 2% over the past 24 hours.  On Wednesday, El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele tweeted that his government had “bought the dip,” adding an additional 420 BTC to the treasury, the equivalent of around $25 million. That purchase was one reason behind today’s price bounce. Bitcoin’s price has whipsawed over the past few days after failing to sustain the all-time high around $66,900 last week.  “Some believe what is happening is a quick balancing process and preparation before the push for new highs, while others think it’s the beginning of a broader correction that will take BTC to $45K-$50K,” FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Kuptsikevich also mentioned that technical price indicators are retreating from overbought levels, which could lower the odds of a sustained correction.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $61,471, +3.82%  Ether (ETH): $4,274, +6.64%  S&P 500: $4,596, +0.98%  Gold: $1,798, +0.09%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.56%  Other analysts are cautiously optimistic and expect the current pullback to attract greater buying interest for the remainder of the year. “We think the risk-on trade is going to be accelerating in the fourth quarter ... [B]ecause crypto has the most volatility, we are extremely bullish on what crypto will do,” Eddie Ghabour, managing partner at Key Advisors Group, said during an interview with CoinDesk  “Despite this quick dip from the highs, the market feels relatively calm and perhaps even slightly optimistic that this is just a dip before a larger rally into year end,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram announcement.  Bitcoin option expiry  A full $3.1 billion of BTC options are set to mature on Friday, which could be a source of volatility. Currently, the top volume contracts have been around the $60,000 strike price, with calls outweighing puts.  Calls (bullish position) give the options buyer the right to purchase the underlying asset in the future at a predetermined price, whereas puts (bearish position) provides the right to sell.  “Long [traders] stand to benefit should BTC maintain current levels [around $60K] and put option volume remains subdued,” FundStrat wrote in a Thursday newsletter.  Ether outperforms  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, returned above $4,000 on Thursday. ETH is up about 4% over the past 24 hours, extending its outperformance versus BTC.  The chart below shows the ETH/BTC ratio, which is currently testing 0.069 resistance – a level where ether previously lagged bitcoin. However, indicators suggest the ratio is not yet overbought, which means ETH/BTC could see further upside toward 0.08 over the next few days.  Altcoin roundup  Dogecoin (DOGE) hits two-month high as shiba inu (SHIB) lags: Two of the most popular meme coins are competing for the ninth spot on the list of top digital assets by market capitalization. Some traders are profiting from the action by taking spread trades. So far, diverging price trends are helping DOGE consolidate its position as the ninth-biggest coin, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported.  SHIB attracts momentum traders: “I’m [trading SHIB] because of the momentum swings that you see in the crypto space but it’s money that I’m willing to lose and have it go down to zero,” Key Advisors Group’s Ghabour said during an interview with CoinDesk. Momentum traders enter and exit trades based on the strength or weakness of price trends.  Polkadot (DOT) solves blockchain pain points: “Polkadot presents a strong investment opportunity given the technology was developed to address the issues inherent in blockchain,” Richard Byworth, CEO of crypto research firm EQONEX wrote in an email to CoinDesk.

A law covering cryptocurrencies will most likely be discussed in the country’s next general budget, the report said, citing Indian Finance Ministry officials.  The government is likely to opt for regulating cryptocurrencies as an asset class, similar to commodities, with appropriate taxation of transactions and gains.  India’s Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officials are currently engaged in “fine-tuning the conceptual framework and the necessary regulations,” according to Business Today.

This follows El Salvador’s government buying more bitcoin for its official account.  On Wednesday, El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele tweeted that his government had “bought the dip,” adding an additional 420 BTC, which is equivalent to around $25 million. El Salvador’s treasury now holds an estimated 1,120 bitcoin, according to a Reuters report.  “Today the markets were buoyed by news of additional state-level purchases from El Salvador, indicating the country’s intentions to continue to acquire,” said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics.  Underlying sentiment remains extremely bullish for the top cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, according to Deane.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization reached an all-time high on Oct. 20 of around $66,900, a day after the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. launched on the New York Stock Exchange. A week later, bitcoin’s price fell below the $60,000 mark before retaking the level early Thursday.  “After a legendary sell-off that was predominantly in altcoins, we are seeing some relief and a bounce off initial $58,000 support,” said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer at Stack Funds.  Dibb predicted that “the next day will likely continue to be volatile, with a large options expiry happening tomorrow.”  Dibb expects bitcoin and ether (ETH) to surpass recent all-time highs within the next few weeks.  ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, reached an all-time high on Oct. 21 at $4,359. At press time, ETH was trading up 4.1% over the past 24 hours to $4,186.

The company said it purchased the bitcoin by “successfully raising capital in the quarter through our at-the-market equity offering.”  At current prices, the value of its bitcoin holdings is just over $7 billion; MicroStrategy’s entire market capitalization is roughly $7.4 billion.  The carrying value of MicroStrategy’s bitcoin was $2.406 billion, which reflects cumulative impairment losses of $754.7 million. Under accounting rules for digital assets, companies must report an impairment if the asset’s price goes below the company’s purchase price at any time during the quarter.  The company said it will “continue to evaluate opportunities to raise additional capital to execute on our bitcoin strategy.”  CEO Michael Saylor said on MicroStrategy’s earnings conference call that the company is committed to buying bitcoin and doesn’t have plans to sell. Saylor called bitcoin a “great” long-term investment for shareholders.  Saylor is open to partnerships that may allow MicroStrategy to buy more bitcoin.  Saylor said that the last three months have displayed “extremely dramatic” developments for bitcoin, including more institutional adoption and continuing regulatory discussions. Bitcoin-linked ETF’s are another “checkbox” for institutional investors, Saylor said.  Saylor added there’s a “profound game-changing dynamic here with big tech and bitcoin,” touting such examples as Square’s Cash App and Twitter’s tip option.  Overall, MicroStrategy reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.86 on revenues of $128.0 million for the quarter, beating analyst estimates for adjusted EPS of $0.64 and revenues of $127.5 million, according to FactSet.  Shares of MicroStrategy were rising 1.3% postmarket to about $727 on Thursday.  On Thursday, Saylor also retweeted a previous tweet of his from Oct. 28, 2020, revealing that he personally owned 17,732 bitcoin that he purchased for an average price of just under $10,000. He added the comment that “you do not sell your #bitcoin,” implying that he still owned all those coins. At current prices, they would be worth roughly $1.1 billion.

42375920,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwD321,1635452535,How a 14-Year-Old Used Solana NFTs to Raise $100K for Beluga Whale Conservation,"At a time when non-fungible tokens face scrutiny for environmental damage, 14-year-old Abigail is using NFTs for conservation.  Her project, “Belugies,” is a collection of 8,000 cartoon beluga whale NFTs created on the Solana blockchain. Abigail made the artwork for the project by hand, with plans to donate a portion of the profits to beluga conservation efforts and a children’s hospital program.  The high school freshman says she learned about cryptocurrency when she was nine years old during bicycle rides with her older brother Adam. Adam, now 25 years old and heavily into crypto since 2016, said he and his fianceé Briana helped with the tech.  “When we started, we didn’t really think it would work out,” Adam, who declined to provide his last name, told CoinDesk. “I told my sister, ‘Hey, if it doesn’t work at least we tried, at least we had fun. That’s all that matters.’”  Within 10 hours of the project’s Oct. 17 launch, all 8,000 NFTs had been minted, earning the siblings over $1 million in SOL tokens.  Abigail is also set to receive 5% of all future Belugie sales. The current floor price for a Belugie on the resale market is 0.32 SOL, and the project’s total trade volume has exceeded 7,159 SOL, or $1,409,700, at press time.  The inspiration for the artwork came from Abigail’s childhood adoration of beluga whales after she saw them at a Georgia aquarium near where she grew up.  With the global beluga whale population in decline – Alaska’s Cook Inlet subpopulation has crashed 75% since 2008 and now hovers around 280 – she said she wants to raise awareness as well as some cash.  She’s donated $100,000 of the Belugies NFT proceeds to beluga conservation efforts. Half went to the Beluga Whale Alliance, an Alaskan-based group that advocates for and studies the Cook Inlet pod. The other half went to the Ocean Defenders Alliance, which works to remove fishing nets and plastic that threaten underwater habitats.  After getting word of the donation, Beluga Whale Alliance flew Abigail, Adam and Briana out to Alaska to see the belugas up close and personal in their natural habitat.  The project’s emphasis on conservation contrasts with popular criticisms of the NFT industry.  Ethereum, the blockchain underlying the majority of NFT projects, currently uses an energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism. (When upgraded, Ethereum 2.0 will switch to a proof-of-stake system.) While some blockchains including Solana use the more efficient proof-of-stake, the overall impact NFTs have on the environment remains harmful.  Abigail credits much of the project’s success to the belugas themselves for being so “wholesome and adorable,” which she attempted to convey in her artwork.  In addition, she made a $100,000 donation to Sunshine Kids, an organization that supports children’s hospital programs across the country. Abigail cited a personal connection to her local children’s hospital as the reason for the donation.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/28/how-a-14-year-old-used-solana-nfts-to-raise-100k-for-beluga-conservation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/829addf980fdafc2ca0cbddd2f1f1ab76a752901-3715x2694.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A section of the Rules Committee print of the bill, dated Oct. 28, adds cryptocurrency transactions to the constructive sale rule. The rule addresses transactions that would be subject to capital gains taxes, preventing traders or institutions from using short sales or derivatives that deliver “already-held assets,” according to Investopedia.  “The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply to constructive sales (determined after the application of the amendment made by subsection (b)) after the date of the enactment of this Act,” the bill said.  The bill defines a digital asset as “any digital representation of value which is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology.”  A much longer draft text of H.R. 5376, also published by the Rules Committee, contains an identical provision.  A second provision in the first version of the bill directs some funding for the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. tax collector, for “provid[ing] cryptocurrency monitoring and compliance activities.” The longer draft does not explicitly mention cryptocurrency at all.  Read more: US Lawmakers Float New Crypto Tax Provisions in Reconciliation Bill  A draft of the bill published by the House Ways and Means Committee last month contained similar language, but unlike a crypto tax provision included in a bipartisan infrastructure bill, industry proponents are not concerned about the BBB provision.  However, the two bills have been linked by progressive lawmakers in the House, who have vowed not to vote for the bipartisan bill unless the House also votes on the BBB Act. Senate negotiations on the BBB Act between Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and the rest of the Democratic Caucus, as well as Biden, have been ongoing.  Biden announced a framework for the new version of the bill on Thursday morning, saying that “no one got everything they wanted” but the parties had created a compromise document.  The BBB Act is meant to enact a signature portion of Biden’s campaign pledge in providing funding for child care and preschool, Medicaid, child tax credits, clean energy, housing, education and other issues, according to a White House press release.

42410947,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtjcI,1635452188,Curve Finance’s CRV Quietly Becomes a Top-Performing DeFi Token Despite Meme-Token Craze,"Curve dao (CRV), the governance token for automated market maker (AMM) protocol Curve Finance, has quietly risen to become a top performer of the week, despite the craze around the Shiba Inu coin (SHIB) and other dog-themed tokens.  At the time of publication, CRV was changing hands at $4.74, according to data from Messari, up 1.87% in the past 24 hours and nearly 65% over the past week. Among tokens with at least a $1 billion market cap, including SHIB, CRV is the third-best performer this week.  CRV’s rise shows that the excitement in the crypto market has extended far beyond community- and culture-based meme tokens.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) analysts and investors attribute CRV’s latest rally to two main factors: its tokenomics and a rapid growth of a yield optimization protocol focusing on Curve Finance, one of the largest AMMs on the Ethereum blockchain.  Launched in August 2020, the CRV token is designed to incentivize liquidity providers on Curve Finance and encourage governance participation in the community. Five percent of an initial supply of 1.3 billion CRV was distributed to liquidity providers before the token’s launch, with a one-year vesting.  “The distribution to the users who provided liquidity before token launch ended,” said Arthur Cheong, founder and portfolio manager of DeFi investment fund DeFiance Capital, adding that any potential sell pressure on CRV from the event declined.  George Harrap, co-founder of DeFi protocol Step Finance, tweeted on Oct. 25 that he “was excited to see the recent events in $CRV. Now a major part of distribution is done and we will see things move in one direction.”  While the one-time event may have accelerated CRV’s price gains in recent days, analysts highlighted that CRV’s growth has largely benefited from Convex Finance, a new yield optimization platform that boosts rewards for CRV liquid providers.  In just about five months since Convex Finance launched, the total value locked in the platform has reached $13.36 billion, according to Defi Llama’s data. TVL is the U.S. dollar value of the cryptocurrency committed to a DeFi protocol. The TVL on Curve, in the same time period, has risen to $18.76 billion, more than doubling from $8.8 billion in May.  But how exactly has Convex Finance’s success fueled Curve’s recent growth? According to Convex Finance, by depositing a certain amount of CRV tokens into Convex, users receive a token called cvxCRV for the same amount. Convex will then stake CRV in Curve Finance and receive vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV). As a result, Convex will have voting power to boost CRV rewards to the liquid pools that it is providing liquidity to and therefore be able to maximize the yields in the liquid pools from Curve Finance.  Those who choose to stake their cvxCRV tokens on Convex Finance will receive Convex’s own CVX tokens as staking rewards, as well as part of CRV rewards from Curve via Convex.  Data from Dune Analytics shows that Convex now controls more than 37% of Curve’s governance, giving it a sizable influence to vote in higher rewards for the pools to which it is providing liquidity.  “The whole dynamics of Convex buying CRV consistently for yield [earning] purpose” has powered CRV’s growth, DeFiance Capital’s Cheong said.  “Convex allows Curve Finance liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves,” Convex’s document shows. “Liquidity providers can receive boosted CRV and liquidity mining rewards with minimal effort.”  But there are also risks around using Convex.  Once users deposit CRV on Convex in exchange for cvxCRV tokens, the action is irreversible, meaning that the CRV tokens will be locked forever.  “Having cvxCRV maintain a close price peg to CRV on the open market is the lynchpin that holds everything together,” crypto research boutique firm Delphi Digital wrote in a research study in August. “Remember, cvxCRV is liquid meaning there will be sell pressure.”",POSITIVE,CRV | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | MARKET | MINING | SHIB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/28/curve-finances-crv-quietly-becomes-a-top-performing-defi-token-despite-meme-token-craze,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24f8823494f2cdfda6c41b0ecd00d4adddadd040-2157x1438.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394380,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcjwz,1635448231,The CFTC vs. the Truth,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has neither confirmed nor denied a report that it’s investigating a popular Ethereum-based betting market. But you’re free to place bets on the likelihood of such a probe on the platform at the center of the kerfuffle, Polymarket.  Founded in March 2020, Polymarket allows a wide range of individuals to place bets on the likelihood of real-world events. Still in beta testing mode, the so-called “truth market” has seen some $4 billion in shares trade over its lifetime.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Bloomberg reported last week that the CFTC is looking into whether Polymarket let users improperly trade swaps or binary options, and whether the company should be registered with the commodities regulator. The more interesting question, to my mind, is whether Polymarket and other betting markets should be allowed to operate as advertised.  Read more: Largest DeFi Prediction Market Polymarket Said to Be Under Investigation by CFTC: Report  Economists have long been interested in the idea of prediction markets as a way to test the efficient market hypothesis. Users place bets on the probability of certain events occurring – from the vital, such as whether the U.S. Senate’s bipartisan infrastructure bill will pass, to the mundane, such as whether Clubhouse will announce it will be acquired.  Prediction markets operate on the idea that people with “skin in the game” are more likely to come to an accurate rendering of reality. The profit motive, in theory, cuts through bias, partisanship and information inefficiency and serves as a neutral platform for generating data about the world.  It’s a way to crowdsource the truth – or at a minimum, to find out what people are really thinking. If there’s money on the line, should they make the wrong prediction then people have a strong incentive to bet on their beliefs, not on what they think others want to hear. And if there’s money to be made if they forecast correctly, those with expertise have a strong incentive to take part.  That trading activity is useful. It stands to reason that informed readers make the best investors. Polymarket deals information at two levels. First, individual users are motivated to read deeply and widely and place their bets accordingly. Second, the data generated from these markets is a useful metric for anyone interested in knowing more and gauging sentiments – it’s sort of a public utility.  “When you decide to buy shares in a market, you are weighing in with your own knowledge, research and view of the future. Market prices reflect what traders think are the odds of future events, turning trading activity into actionable insights that help people make better decisions,” a Polymarket FAQ reads.  The thing is: If we’re going to crowdsource the truth, then we’d want as large a crowd as possible. If participation is limited to accredited investors, to geographical regions, to everyone but New York State residents, it necessarily distorts the fact-finding process. It could even limit what type of questions would even be asked. Subjecting prediction markets to the CFTC’s licensing regime would therefore make them less useful to society.  “I think betting markets are pretty sweet for eliciting truth and forecasting, but also that doesn’t matter in the slightest to the CFTC or bureaucrats in general,” Gwern, the pseudonymous, independent researcher and writer with expertise in prediction markets, said.  Limitations  Prediction markets are not perfect. Gambling can be compulsive – people can bet and lose money they don’t really have. There are still market asymmetries where insiders can profit on non-public information. Some people who have money to lose may act to effect the result they want.  But, in aggregate, data shows prediction markets offer an accurate lens on the world. That’s part of the reason why so many crypto people – often motivated by a sense of the public good (it’s free and open software, after all) and strong conviction in markets, have built, funded and used “truth markets” over the years.  Polymarket is the latest and most successful of the bunch. It has a diverse offering of markets, many of which have healthy volumes and liquidity. It’s also arguably the least deserving of government enforcement action. There’s no native token; instead, trades are conducted using the USDC stablecoin – with several restrictions.  The platform does not custody customer funds, does not participate in markets, does not bet against its users and, significantly, does not profit from trades. There are trading fees, but the 2% charge goes to liquidity providers in the market.  Founder Shayne Coplan told CoinDesk last April he’s still thinking about ways to monetize the platform. But his higher ambition is that Polymarket, which is just an interface for the open-source, smart contract-based markets underneath, is baked into the foundation of Web 3, the envisioned decentralized successor to today’s miserable version of the internet. This could have serious implications for combating or quelling misinformation.  (Coplan declined to speak on the record for this article, as did his counsel, James McDonald, of Sullivan & Cromwell, who used to oversee investigations at the CFTC.)  There are some restrictions on Polymarket use. Not everyone can create or participate in markets. People in the U.S. are unable to purchase the USDC stablecoins directly using debit or credit cards. And, as most Ethereum users can attest, there are very few unmonitored on-ramps into this ecosystem – at some point, whether you’re buying USDC on Coinbase or Uniswap, you’ll come up against identification methods.  See also: ‘Careless’ Users Are Ruining Ethereum’s Privacy: Paper  But even for people who skirt these protections, all transactions on public blockchains are … public. If people are breaking the rules or are acting in a suspicious manner, it’s trivial to set up alert notifications for whenever their funds move.  Unlimited?  The CFTC has had an inconsistent record when it comes to overseeing prediction markets. In 2012, the agency dinged Dublin-based Intrade The Prediction Market Limited (Intrade) and Trade Exchange Network Limited (TEN) for permitting U.S. residents to trade and, more significantly, lying to the agency.  This year ErisX shelved plans to offer futures contracts based on National Football League games following CFTC prodding. But nonprofit, centralized markets PredictIt and the Iowa Electronic Market are protected under separate no-action letters from the CFTC. The Sequoia and Charles Schwab-backed startup Kalshi operates as an official contract market with all the reporting requirements that entails.  When it comes to binary contracts, reportedly part of the CFTC’s investigation into Polymarket, what seems like a black-and-white issue – either yes these are regulated derivatives or not – is a little more gray. Swaps are derivative contracts to exchange money for a set period of time, while binary options let investors trade on price fluctuations.  But as crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro notes, Polymarket is just an interface for contracts that live on Ethereum. “If that makes you a securities or futures exchange then so is Bloomberg Terminal,” he tweeted.  See also: ‘Wrong’ to Regulate Crypto Through Enforcement: Ex-CFTC Official Quintenz  It’s an open question whether betting markets like Polymarket provide the type of utility they promise – whether they live up to the mantle of being “truth markets.” Robin Hanson, the associate professor of economics at George Mason University often credited with running the first corporate prediction market, has been critical of the current wave of offerings.  Binary options (vote yes or no whether an event will occur) rarely produce actionable information, he said. Instead, platforms like Polymarket should support conditional variables, which account for changing circumstances.  Well, here’s a conditional: If Polymarket can provide value by crowdsourcing the truth, then wouldn’t we want the greatest number of people to have access?

42394377,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcjmj,1635446881,4 Reasons Not to Invest in Bitcoin Futures ETFs,"Bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have arrived in the U.S. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), and a string of others is expected to follow.  Should you buy any of these?  As I’ve told subscribers to my Crypto Capitalist Letter, the short answer is no.  Mark E. Jeftovic is the CEO of easyDNS and author of The Crypto Capitalist Letter.  Here’s why:  We have better ways to gain our exposure to bitcoin, and here we’ll look at why a bitcoin futures ETF has drawbacks even as compared to a spot ETF.  The difference between a futures ETF and a spot ETF is that the latter holds the underlying asset in treasury. Think of a pile of gold in a vault somewhere, against which shares are issued and sold on the open market. Owning the shares correlates to claims on the assets in custody. In spot ETFs you can even redeem your shares for the assets they represent.  This is also possible in cryptocurrency ETFs and closed-end funds. You can redeem your shares for the underlying bitcoin, or ethereum or whatever the vehicle is invested in.  Contrast to the former, the futures ETFs. While some commodities futures contracts are for settlement in the commodity itself (urban legends abound of flat-footed traders waking up the morning of their contract’s settlement day to discover a truck pulling into their driveway and dumping a few tons of sugar or coffee beans onto their front lawn), the bitcoin futures ETFs are cash settled.  That means no matter what happens to the price or what you decide you want to do with your positions in the future, there is no option for redemption of the underlying asset, you have no claim on actual bitcoin.  You are only a party to a contract to settle in cash at some future date.  One of the main attractions to assets like gold and bitcoin is the absence of counterparty risk. You may face custodial risk, which is a separate issue. But in terms of counterparties, when you own gold or you own bitcoin, the price is the price, and you own what you own regardless of how that affects anybody else in the world.  Read more: Why a Bitcoin Futures ETF Is Bad for Investors - Michael J. Casey  Below are four reasons why we’ll be avoiding these ETFs, followed by what you should buy instead.  Reason #1: Counterparty risk  In the movie “The Big Short,” you may remember how the protagonists (who had long predicted that the mortgage-backed securities would blow up markets) experienced a peculiar kind of angst as their trades were finally vindicated, only to find their profits in jeopardy as cascading failures blew up their counterparties. FrontPoint Partners, in particular (the team led by Steve Carell’s character), found themselves in the surreal position of their own parent bank becoming insolvent from its exposure to derivatives FrontPoint had shorted heavily.  Cash-settled futures ETFs are all derivatives, and thus they all have counterparty risk.  Reason #2: Diluted exposure  Owing to SEC regulations (consumer protection, and all that), the bitcoin futures ETFs can only mimic exposure to bitcoin of up to 85% of the their net asset value (NAV). The other 15% has to be “safer” instruments like Treasury bills or bonds to provide some kind of cushion.  Reason #3: Decay  As the future contracts settlement date approaches, they have to be rolled over to the next period. That causes decay as this entails transaction costs on closing out and opening new positions.  On top of that, there are the actual fund fees, which in the case of BITO is another 0.95%. (The “contango” phenomenon refers to when prices for longer-dated contracts are more expensive than shorter-dated ones.)  If you own bitcoin directly, or even a spot ETF, you don’t have decay. You’re just long bitcoin and the only thing you really have to worry about is the actual price.  Reason #4: Divergence  Goldbugs have been complaining for decades how the paper futures markets don’t reflect the underlying value of spot gold. We see this get conspicuously out of whack during high volatility episodes like #silversqueeze, earlier this year – when physical silver was trading at premiums north of 30% on the futures price.  We can see the opposite happen, like when oil futures traded at a negative value for a day on April 20, 2020.  In that sense, trading futures ETFs is really more about betting on the price of the futures itself than on the underlying asset that the futures represent. The spot price and the futures price are two different things that mostly, sort of, correlate. But not always. Those times when they don’t are usually quite chaotic.  Read more: Contango Conmigo: Why a Bitcoin Futures ETF Could Be a Bloody Ride - David Z. Morris  What to do instead  Here in Canada, this is no problem. Bitcoin and ethereum ETFs have been around for awhile now and we have multiple options to choose from.  In the U.S., it can be trickier.  If this is the case, then here’s two options: the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) and the Grayscale Trust Bitcoin Fund (GBTC). (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Grayscale has made no secret of its intention to convert to a spot ETF, and with these futures ETFs approved, they have already refiled the paperwork to do so.  The Bitwise fund is mostly allocated to the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, with 63% in bitcoin and 26% in ethereum. The remaining 10% is split across other layer 1 cryptos like cardano, litecoin, polygon and cosmos.  Let the bitcoin futures ETFs increase the profile of the space and open up the asset class to previously inaccessible investors such as pension funds. But for our purposes, these instruments are for other people.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Mark Jeftovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/28/4-reasons-not-to-invest-in-bitcoin-futures-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/412553f26deb3048548a62131dcbb268b6baa8d4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sphere 3D, a data management company that trades on the Nasdaq, and privately held Gryphon Digital Mining, which focuses on mining bitcoin through 100% renewable energy, announced in June they were going public through a reverse merger. Under terms of the deal, Sphere said it will issue 111 million shares to Gryphon shareholders, who will control 77% of the combined company. Sphere holders will own the remaining 23%.  Shares of Sphere 3D, which will be named Gryphon Digital upon the completion of the merger, were trading around $6.35 at the time of publication, implying the potential for the stock to climb more than 50%, based on PI Financial’s price target.  PI analyst Kris Thompson noted that the company has orders for 67,200 Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro miners, equating to 6.7 EH/s of computing power by the third quarter of next year. Thompson wrote that Gryphon Digital Mining could rank among the top five miners globally.  Gryphon Digital also has an option to acquire an additional 160,000 machines by January 2022.  Thompson highlighted the significant bitcoin management experience of the combined entity. Rob Chang, Gryphon Digital Mining’s CEO, and Chris Ensey, the company’s chief technology adviser, both previously held senior executive positions at one of the largest miners, Riot Blockchain.  “Chang and team have had great success at Gryphon over the past year raising $14M in February to establish a renewable energy-driven bitcoin mining operation,” Thompson wrote.  The Sphere 3D-Gryphon Digital Mining merger is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year, although Thompson wrote that he wouldn’t be surprised if the merger takes place in the first quarter of 2022, due to its complicated nature.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/28/sphere-3d-receives-buy-rating-ahead-of-gryphon-digital-mining-merger,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67fa02af0050344c1d0cb756e0e6ba3a30225b8b-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The NFT’s title says it all: “The Tungsten Cube - 14 inch, ~1,784 lb cube held in Willowbrook, Illinois, USA by Midwest Tungsten Service.” Bidding on OpenSea begins Friday, e-commerce director Sean Murray told CoinDesk.  According to the description on OpenSea, the NFT grants its holder once-a-year visiting rights for the super-dense cube.  The NFT is the latest twist in a weeklong meme saga that turned a sleepy metals manufacturer into Crypto Twitter’s unlikely celebrity, and all because of super-dense cubes.  Traders and journalists and tweeters and moonbois have been acquiring these desk tchotchkes for hundreds of dollars or more. (Disclosure: This reporter has his own Midwest 1-incher. It’s surprisingly dense!)  Keeping the 14-inch cube at Midwest Tungsten HQ might be out of necessity.  Murray previously told CoinDesk that Midwest Tungsten was considering creating a supremely heavy cube but wasn’t sure how to get transportation squared away.  He’d also sworn to keep Midwest Tungsten focused on the metals and not NFTs. But a week of surging sales changed the calculus.  “I wanted to let you know first that we’re going to try an NFT.

Some traders are profiting from the action by taking spread trades.  DOGE has come alive after lagging SHIB by a significant margin earlier this month. The joke cryptocurrency surged to $0.335 on Coinbase on Thursday, hitting the highest level since Aug. 20. It was last trading near $0.30, representing a 22% gain on the day.  Meanwhile, SHIB crashed as much as 30% to $0.00006 earlier today, having chalked out a rally to $0.00009 in the seven days to Oct. 27.  Diverging price trends are helping DOGE consolidate its position as the ninth-biggest coin. However, with a market capitalization of $34 billion, SHIB doesn’t appear to be far behind DOGE’s $39 billion market cap. The self-proclaimed dogecoin-killer briefly topped its rival in the rankings on Wednesday.  The price action observed in the past several hours is perhaps reflective of the rotation of money out of SHIB and into the relatively undervalued DOGE.

42375909,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwD2qh,1635445135,FATF Crypto Guidance Looks to Bring Industry in Line With Banks,"Global anti-money laundering (AML) agency the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has released its updated guidance for firms that handle cryptocurrency and virtual assets.  It appears designed to corral much of the nascent industry into the existing regulatory framework for banks.  After incorporating industry feedback from April 2021, the updated rules for so-called virtual asset service providers (VASPs), published Thursday, signals that regulation is coming for crypto firms, both centralized and decentralized.  Since 2018, the FATF has issued a series of draft papers and working group documents that sought to define VASPs and virtual assets, and also recommend how countries implement the “Travel Rule” for crypto, shorthand for the requirement that VASPs share customer data for transactions over a certain threshold.  ‘Unhosted’  More recently, the FATF has tried to account for transactions to and from “unhosted wallets” (generally referred to as non-custodial wallets among crypto users), and also shoehorn into its framework new areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  “We recognize that there are a number of areas where both countries and the private sector have wanted more guidance from the FATF level about how they can implement this in practice,” said FATF policy analyst Ken Menz in an interview with CoinDesk. “I think this really shows just how fast the virtual asset ecosystem changes, and how quickly new technologies, new businesses, new models appear. I think it is a challenge for anyone to just keep on top of everything new that happens in this industry.”  Read more: FATF Needs Entirely New Approach to Regulating Crypto, Says V20 Summit  While the release of FATF’s updated guidance will increase the urgency for VASPs to become compliant, there is also a recommendation that regulators be flexible during the initial rollout, acknowledging the real-world issues VASPs and Travel Rule service providers have pointed out to them.  “The FATF is basically saying that regulators can take a staged approach to enforcement of the Travel Rule so their [local] VASPs can realistically implement it,” said Pelle Braendgaard, CEO of crypto AML firm Notabene. “They are also recommending that VASPs be able to continue to do transactions with VASPs in non-compliant jurisdictions, to avoid excluding firms in the developing world, for example.”  The message from FATF is that countries have to implement these standards now, Menz stated. However, using the Travel Rule as an example, in that implementation, they might want to consider a staged or phased approach to the implementation of that.  “We recognize there is a lot of effort that goes into building the compliance tools to do this. And there may be a certain level of time that a VASP needs to invest in the necessary technologies to enable them to comply,” Menz said.  One interesting addition on the Travel Rule, buried in paragraph 291 of the updated guidance, is the possibility that a VASP could decide not to share customer data with another VASP deemed to pose a risk to that sensitive data, as pointed out by Siân Jones, the eagle-eyed senior partner at XReg Consulting.  “One thing that leaped out for me was that the updated guidance allows for alternative procedures, including not sending required user information, if a VASP believes a counterpart VASP will not handle transmitted user data securely and the AML/CFT risks are acceptable,” Jones said in an email. “In such cases, VASPs can still execute a transfer but the implication is that such risk assessments are made on a case-by-case basis and therefore could carry significant compliance burden and cost.”  It’s an open question what effect leveling the regulatory playing field will have on a sector that’s focus has been solely on innovation for the last decade.  Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule  Regulatory clarity is much needed in crypto, and the FATF’s acknowledgment that virtual assets are too big to ignore ought to boost mainstream adoption, said David Carlisle, director of policy and regulatory affairs at Elliptic.  In the meantime, FATF’s updated guidance could – perhaps counterintuitively – present the greatest opportunity for banks and larger financial institutions entering the space, according to Carlisle.  “Complying with financial regulation takes time and money, and businesses that have historically invested in compliance resources will have a significant head start,” Carlisle said. “Banks looking to enter the virtual asset space have been eager for greater regulatory clarity, and the FATF is giving them a huge boost in that regard.”  DeFi defined  The fast-moving DeFi arena has proved to be a tricky area to set out guidance, given that the FATF standards generally apply to financial intermediaries. The guidance indicates that those who maintain “control or sufficient influence” over a DeFi arrangement should be regulated for AML purposes.  This suggests that where DeFi developers have the ability to restrict coin listings on a decentralized exchange, operate a domain that enables user access, or are otherwise able to intervene in the activities of a DeFi marketplace in a significant way - they could very well be captured by regulation, noted Elliptic’s Carlisle.  “Helpfully, the guidance clarifies that individual governance token holders shouldn’t fall within the regulatory perimeter if they don’t exercise this type of influence over activities in a particular DeFi marketplace,” he said.  Read more: Is ‘DeFi Regulation’ an Oxymoron?  The guidance sets out how the FATF standards can apply in a DeFi arrangement and encourages countries to take an expansive approach to the definition of what is a VASP, said FATF’s Menz.  “So, not to focus on the terminology, not to focus on whether something calls itself DeFi and look about what we call owner-operators of DeFi arrangements and the extent to which there’s control or sufficient influence over that protocol in determining whether it would be VASP,” said Menz, adding:  “DeFi has exploded in popularity over the last year, but I don’t think we know exactly how it’s going to evolve over the future, to what extent is it going to be incorporated into traditional finance, will protocols become decentralized or be partially decentralized?”  Devilish detail  While the updated guidance shows a good faith effort to address concerns regarding earlier drafts, there were points that still needed to be revised, according to Travel Rule compliance provider Shyft Network, issues that were outlined in the firm’s response to FATF earlier this year.  For example, FATF’s expansive definition of VASPs creates certain inconsistencies around the concept of key signers or holders of a private key who may be involved in the signing of messages on behalf of smart contracts, particularly in the rapidly-expanding realm of DAOs.  The implication, which FATF’s updated guidance provides only a slight nuance around, is that a DAO’s key signers would be classed as being a VASP, Shyft co-founder Joseph Weinberg said in an email.  Read more: State of Crypto: FATF’s New Guidance Takes Aim at DeFi  Another point of contention is FATF’s unclear distinction between development companies and open-source software developers that are individuals. “The final guidance makes minor edits around the use of the term ‘developers,’ but no further clarity is provided to distinguish between development companies and open-software developers,” Weinberg said.  Finally, the application of a bank-grade AML framework onto unhosted wallets remains a major challenge, he said. There is a recommendation from FATF that greater use of blockchain analytics must come into play, but the onus when it comes to mitigating money laundering is on VASPs.  “The final guidance does not provide any further clarity on FATF expectations when VASPs transact with unhosted wallets and in fact reinforces the idea that such virtual asset transfers should be treated as higher risk transactions that require enhanced scrutiny and limitations,” Shyft’s Weinberg said.

The funds will help advance the company’s institutional-grade intelligence platform.  The round was led by Velvet Sea Ventures with participation from Alameda Research, BlockFi, Pomp Investments, Lightspeed, Gemini Frontier Fund, Blockchain.com and Avon Ventures.  Elementus offers blockchain compliance and data analytics solutions aimed at government agencies, financial institutions, researchers and investors. The crypto forensic solution can be used for market intelligence, security vulnerability detection and the identification of bad actors.  “What we have accomplished and plan to do with the funds announced today is provide an institutional grade platform that offers the search speed and scope of Google and the data insight of the Palantir platform. Trust me. This is no easy task. But we are doing it,” Elementus CEO Max Galka wrote in an email to investors that was shown to CoinDesk.  The startup has deep ties to Palantir, the publicly traded software company that specializes in data analytics. Elementus President Greg Barbaccia worked at Palantir for a decade, most recently as head of investigations.

Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon, both general partners at longtime Rally backer Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), are among the investors in SuperLayer Labs, the new startup accelerator seeding independent consumer Web 3 projects that utilize Rally’s RLY token.  Essentially, SuperLayer aims to be for the Rally network what ConsenSys has been for Ethereum.  Rally is a blockchain network that allows internet creators such as streamers and artists to monetize their relationships with their fanbases. In August, its community members voted to split the ecosystem five-fold – into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), a venture studio, a nonprofit, an affiliate and a corporation – in a bid to increase the project’s decentralization.  Read more: RLY Holders Approve Social Token Platform’s Decentralization Plan  SuperLayer’s formal launch comes as some in the Rally community debate how decentralized the broader ecosystem really is. On Oct. 26, community member “Masongos,” who is active on the project forums, said Rally’s early investors and team members control over three-quarters of the RLY token’s circulating supply.  That’s “more than double their intended share of the final economy,” the user wrote. “The decision to sell off such a large portion of the economy left the Rally platform in a state where it operates somewhere between a decentralized ecosystem and a centralized start-up.”  Masongos said RLY’s tokenomics could have consequences for project governance, profits and incentive programs. The user called for changes to RLY’s distribution scheme.  On Thursday morning, Rally co-founder Kevin Chou said in response that he was “100% supportive” of the proposed changes and would “personally commit” to fixes.  He was unavailable for an interview prior to press time.  New investors, old leadership  Paris Hilton, Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma, investor Packy McCormick, former football great Joe Montana, entrepreneur Brit Morin, rapper (and early Coinbase investor) Nas, talent agency veteran Michael Ovitz and newsletter writer Lenny Rachitsky are new backers of SuperLayer, the press release said.  SuperLayer Chief Product Officer Saad Rizvi is also new to the ecosystem. He is the only newcomer among the venture studio’s leadership.  Chou and co-founder Mahesh Vellanki will run SuperLayer, according to the press release. Rally’s former general counsel, Ira Lam, is its top lawyer. Gary Coover, the chief operating officer, has been helping shape the formation of Rally’s DAO since August, according to project forums.  Major token holders approved the appointments in the August vote. The vote also granted SuperLayer millions of dollars in RLY tokens to invest in Web 3 projects that utilize the token.  It will soon start deploying $25 million – a combination of money authorized in the August vote and checks from the new investors – in an attempt to fund projects building on RLY.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/28/rally-venture-studio-launches-with-fresh-backing-from-paris-hilton-and-marc-andreessen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36fef894341772f2a6b5fd6017abb5bd7d8ec970-3380x2253.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The meme coin had managed to crawl out of growing obscurity to the forefront of the crypto market. While the broader market has suffered alongside top cryptocurrency bitcoin, Shiba Inu has had other plans. Carving out its own growth pattern, the value of the asset had rallied to a new all-time high on Wednesday. Its break above $0.00004 and the subsequent crash had led the market to believe that the rally would be short-lived. SHIB had promptly fallen back to range $0.00003 range after hitting its new all-time high. But going against expectations, it had resumed its rally again and this time, its price had once again doubled, peaking above $0.00008.

In an interview with Reuters reported Monday, Jelena McWilliams, chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), said banks needed to be allowed to get involved with crypto.  “If we don’t bring this activity inside the banks, it is going to develop outside of the banks,” McWilliams said. “The federal regulators won’t be able to regulate it.”  The FDIC is one of the federal banking regulators in the U.S. and one of two entities that provide deposit insurance to federally regulated institutions.

Some venture capital firms are betting they do.  Squads, an application that can be used to create DAOs on the Solana blockchain, has raised a $1.5 million seed round, the company announced Wednesday.  The round was led by Collab+Currency with participation from Reciprocal Ventures, Volt Capital, Chaotic Capital, 6thman Ventures, Republic Capital, 8186 Capital and Solana Capital.  The startup combines all the essential components of a DAO such as deployment, treasury and vault management, on-chain voting and chat into one portal, with an accessible interface that makes starting a DAO “as easy as starting a group chat,” Squads CEO Stepan Simkin said in a press release.  The company says it will use the funding for the beta release of its core product with a mainnet, or live, release to follow.  While DAOs have become a common structure for groups in crypto, Squads believes their utility can extend to companies outside of those industries including freelancers banding together for contract work, investment clubs pooling resources, gaming guilds coordinating accounts and even sports leagues managing equipment are all examples of organizations that could benefit from a DAO structure.  Stephen McKeon, partner at Collab+Currency, said Squads “sees a future where DAOs become a commonplace structure for organizing economic activity. We believe that rather than working for a corporation or nonprofit, many people will work for a protocol someday.

42396688,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4kA1,1635432076,NFT Ticketing Gets Boost With Mobile App From YellowHeart,"The startup behind the Kings of Leon’s foray into crypto is looking to disrupt the $15 billion live entertainment resale market with its own ticketing app.  YellowHeart and its app, “YellowHeart Wallet,” which was released Thursday, uses Ethereum and Polygon integrations to store tickets as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the app’s wallet, the company said in a press release.  Tickets can be purchased within the app using both crypto and fiat payment systems. The NFTs change their artwork once scanned, adding an element of collectibility for those who attend the event.  Having tickets expressed as NFTs allows for venues and artists to more easily track their movement on secondary markets, taking a portion of the resale profits by programming fees into the NFTs themselves.  The company believes that tracking tickets with blockchain could reduce the impact of scalping, where third-party sellers buy tickets in bulk to resell at marked-up rates.  Purchasers of NFT-based tickets on YellowHeart’s app essentially become token holders for the acts they see, being granted access to exclusive content and perks similar to that of a social token, without any additional cost to the original tickets.  Read more: Miami Art Festival Sells VIP Tickets as NFTs  YellowHeart mentioned “discounts at selected stores or restaurants before or after a show, access to private events, and exclusive meet & greets” and potential rewards for holders of NFTs within the app.  A representative of YellowHeart told CoinDesk that while the company is currently focused on ticketing in the music industry, it sees the utility of the technology extending into other arenas, such as sports, in the future.  “Artists, teams and venues that don’t adapt will get left behind,” said Josh Katz, CEO of YellowHeart. “Providing fans with a technology that grants exclusive access to concert tickets and event-specific content is a real win for us, combining this with our focus on artist community tokens, exclusive album-connected NFT content and the possibilities for creativity from here are endless.”  YellowHeart raised a $2.9 million seed round in 2018 backed by the investment of pop duo The Chainsmokers.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/28/nft-ticketing-gets-boost-with-mobile-app-from-yellowheart,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22be9b55a4681898b3321b6ff98b65678c922816-4944x3708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396669,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4jtI,1635431456,"Crypto Miners Are ‘Stockpiling’ Bitcoin Amid Recent Rally, Kraken Says","Crypto miners large and small are accumulating bitcoin, creating a “supply shock” to the bitcoin market that has helped drive up prices, Kraken Intelligence said in a new report.  Crypto miners who rely on mining pools appear to be stockpiling bitcoin, with only a small number of the miners taking a profit even as bitcoin recently reached an all-time high, according to the report.  “Both large-scale entities and smaller players, who secure the network via mining pools, appear to be stockpiling bitcoin,” said Pete Humiston, manager at Kraken Intelligence, in an emailed statement to CoinDesk. This “supply shock” seems to have contributed to bitcoin’s price gaining more than 50% for the month to date.  “Hodling,” the crypto term for holding assets, has been a popular strategy among the largest publicly traded miners. The September operational updates from miners including Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital and Hut 8 shows they all have been hoarding the bitcoins they mined in September.  Some of the miners are using these bitcoins to help further bolster their funding and balance sheets. “We’ve seen publicly listed mining companies, like Argo Blockchain, use bitcoin as collateral in order to secure fresh funding for further capital investment,” Humiston said.  However, smaller miners taking some profit doesn’t necessarily reflect bearishness on their part. Rather, it’s likely helping them buy more mining computers, according to Humiston. “Smaller players could be selling into the bitcoin rally to fund the purchase and upkeep of ASIC mining rigs,” he said.  Regardless of how miners are using their newly minted coins, the fact remains a large number of them are still holding bitcoins they are mining, a practice that has become very lucrative. This is evident from more companies diversifying their businesses into mining, even without any previous ties to the sector.  In turn, this is not only helping the mining sector but the Bitcoin network itself. “We can not only interpret the recent surge in bitcoin mining investment as a further signal of rebounding confidence in the crypto asset space, but also argue that a resilient mining sector reinforces the network’s overall resilience, vis à vis, the primary value proposition of Bitcoin itself,” Humiston said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/28/crypto-miners-are-stockpiling-bitcoin-amid-recent-rally-kraken-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38f2f062ac9aba04590db63ba13292916e573211-1600x1091.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394390,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvckc1,1635425400,"Why Bitcoin’s Volatility Is a Feature, Not a Bug","I’m a financial advisor, and my clients own bitcoin. A few of them remind me frequently about bitcoin’s price volatility, which they consider to be a problem.  I used to think that, too, but I was wrong. Bitcoin’s price volatility isn’t a bug – it’s a feature, and one that’s ultimately beneficial.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Bitcoin is ‘digital gold’  To understand why, consider first that bitcoin is an Internet-native hard money asset – i.e., it’s “digital gold.” Real gold scores pretty well on the major characteristics of money. But bitcoin scores even better.  So bitcoin is real competition for the value of the gold market, which is roughly $10 trillion today. This means that bitcoin (current total value of roughly $1 trillion) has up to 10 times the potential upside based on taking market share from gold.  Bitcoin is an early-stage investment  But building gold-like trust among investors takes time. Even if bitcoin is a better hard money overall (which my analysis indicates), it may take decades for other investors to reach the same conclusion and position their portfolios accordingly. Although bitcoin is more than 12 years old, it’s still early days in this competition for hard-money market share.  So treating a bitcoin investment like venture capital or growth equity makes logical sense because it’s much younger than gold and needs to prove itself to be a worthy competitor over time.  Consider the following thought experiment. What if bitcoin didn’t trade every second of every day? What if, instead, you could only exit your bitcoin investment five years after you invested, and in the meantime you marked the value of the investment at cost?  This is somewhat akin to a venture capital or private growth equity investment. You are locked up for years and, although the investment’s value gets marked periodically, those marks aren’t especially meaningful unless and until you see a real exit.  In bitcoin’s 12-year price history, anyone who has treated an investment in bitcoin this way has seen the value of that investment rise by a lot. The average gain over any five-year period in bitcoin’s history has been significant.  Fine, you admit, it’s been a great investment over multi-year periods, but there can be shorter periods in which the price is down a lot. So maybe an investment in bitcoin is worth suffering the price volatility, but that doesn’t make the volatility beneficial, does it?  Actually, it does. That’s because the price volatility makes bitcoin “not money.”  Bitcoin is ‘not money’  How many times have you heard a central banker or high-profile economist say that bitcoin is “too volatile to be money”?  They’re right, of course, but they probably won’t be forever. That’s because bitcoin’s average price volatility has reduced over time. The bigger it gets (in terms of value), the harder it is to move the price. As this monetary “ship” grows bigger, the ocean can’t toss it around as violently.  So, for now, governments, regulators and bankers can allow bitcoin and the ecosystem being built around it to grow and take market share from gold largely unfettered. For them, bitcoin’s current volatility means it’s not a threat. The recent launch of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on bitcoin futures is just the latest evidence of this dynamic.  And by the time bitcoin’s price volatility is low enough for it to be used as a transactional money, so many people will own it (including the rich and powerful) that it will be impossible for governments to attack it.  This makes bitcoin a “heads we win, tails they lose” proposition. Governments won’t treat it like money until the volatility is lower, and the volatility won’t be lower until bitcoin is so valuable and widely held that it can’t be attacked by governments. By that point, the price volatility may be low enough that people actually use it for transactions.  And if bitcoin never becomes transactional money and instead just takes half the value out of the gold market, that’s fine, too. In that scenario, my clients will only make five times their investment from here.  But if bitcoin reaches its potential and takes share from gold, offshore assets, other stores of value (like real estate and stocks) and, ultimately, dollars, euros and yen, then bitcoin’s price will rise much higher than where it is today.  This is a process that could take decades.  Until then, in my opinion, bitcoin is the best risk-adjusted investment opportunity available today. And I tell my fellow financial advisors to embrace its price volatility because it is likely to be accompanied by attractive investment returns.  Just don’t call it money – at least not yet.

When the BTC part revalues in comparison to the accounting currency (USD), we are able to withdraw some USD and leave the trust with the same total,” President Bukele said in a tweet.  In September, Bukele said that the country is taking its first steps to harness massive natural power sources to mine bitcoin.

While some invest in mining to increase their holdings, others opt for crypto staking instead. Crypto staking is the process of &apos;locking up&apos; a piece of your cryptocurrency to contribute to the blockchain network over the long term in exchange for a return on their investment. What is Crypto Staking? As the need for more efficient and cost-effective transactions processing became more prominent, a consensus mechanism Proof of Stake has emerged. Instead of relying on miners solving complex maths problems, it validates transactions by people who are invested in the blockchain. Essentially, the users put their tokens in for a chance to add a new block onto the blockchain in exchange for a reward. And their staked tokens act as a guarantee of the legitimacy of any new transactions. Interestingly, the system automatically chooses validators based on the number of tokens staked and how long the user has held them. So, the more invested a user is, the more rewarded they can be. Benefits of Crypto Staking Apart from creating a passive income stream, crypto staking has several advantages. It does not require any additional investment into hardware like Proof of Work does; It is a more environmentally friendly way of validating transactions; It contributes to the blockchain&apos;s security and efficiency; It can have a very high APY, depending o...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/crypto-staking-how-to-get-passive-income/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Prior to joining Bitpanda Pro, which targets experienced traders and institutions, Barraclough was co-head of digital innovation at JPMorgan in London, where his role was to come up with bleeding-edge innovative businesses and products and services helping to change traditional finance.  The move from a traditional bank to Bitpanda was a “no-brainer,” Barraclough said in an interview. “As cryptocurrency investments further become part of mainstream financial markets, retail and institutional investors are demanding tools which enable them to pursue traditional investing strategies while navigating trading nuances specific to digital assets,” he said.  Barraclough described the crypto arena as complex, adding that while there are many companies vying for leadership positions, few have the right tech, expertise and culture to reach them.

The round valued the company at $4.1 billion. The fresh capital is being used to double down on technology, international expansion and the growth of its team.  Bitpanda investors include the billionaire hedge fund manager Alan Howard, REDO Ventures, LeadBlock Partners and Jump Capital.  The company was founded as a bitcoin exchange in 2014 by Eric Demuth, Paul Klanschek and Christian Trummer, It has expanded beyond crypto to offer the trading of stocks, precious metals and exchange-traded funds.  Bitpanda Pro was introduced in August 2019. It is used by traders and European Union-based companies ranging from private banks to family offices and hedge funds.

The new offices will complement Ledger’s presence in New York and Singapore.  Switzerland, with its history of safekeeping assets plus its relative clarity on cryptocurrency regulation, is an important place for crypto custodians to have a base. Just last month, crypto custody firm Fireblocks opened a Swiss office.  “If you think about the technology companies that are offering custody technology, most of LedgerVault’s competitors are in Switzerland,” said Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier in an interview. “If you look at Swiss banks, they understand custody and cybersecurity better than your average financial institution, and Switzerland is very advanced compared to other places.”  Read more: Switzerland’s SEBA Bank Snags First FINMA License for Liquid Crypto Funds  Ledger Enterprise Solutions also announced Frank Harzheim would be leading new business efforts in Switzerland.  Ledger is also a partner in Komainu, the institutional crypto custody consortium, along with Japanese bank Nomura and digital asset trading firm CoinShares. Komainu and Ledger Enterprise Solutions are actually focused on two quite different use cases, Gauthier pointed out.  “If a bank comes to LedgerVault, it’s because they have decided to do custody themselves and it becomes an on-balance sheet thing for them,” said Gauthier. “So on the one side, you do the custody yourself; on the other side, you delegate custody to Komianu.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/28/crypto-custody-firm-ledger-expands-institutional-footprint-in-switzerland-and-uk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abf0dd26a71b9a03eb80c17672014235b060f7e5-3556x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The institute has drafted a standard and is in the process of approving it, said Li Ming, director of the Blockchain Research Office at the standardization body, during the Fifth China Blockchain Development Competition held in Chengdu, Sichuan.  China is looking to boost blockchain innovation and application in enterprise and government across the country even as it clamps down on crypto. Its latest Five-Year Plan, a planning document that outlines development goals, put blockchain on a par with artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing.  Li said that standards are fundamental to an industry and used the example of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Without a unified standard, he said, devices from different manufacturers wouldn’t be able to connect to the network.  Once the standard is set, the body will look into drafting evaluation criteria around it so that a “benign” ecosystem can be created, the director said.  Key government projects like the Blockchain Services Network and Xinghuo Chain follow an “open permissioned” protocol, which seeks to retain some of the benefits of decentralization while maintaining centralized control.  Exporting Chinese-made blockchain and standards is also a goal of these projects.  Last year, the International Telecommunications Union passed a set of blockchain standards for financial applications developed by the People’s Bank of China, the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, and Huawei.  The institute is responsible for drafting tech standards and is under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
