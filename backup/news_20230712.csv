After rallying more than 30% over a period of three weeks, the digital asset is now the 10th-largest cryptocurrency in the space. LTC’s Market Cap Crosses $7.1 Billion In the space of a month, the price of Litecoin’s native LTC token shot up from its June lows of $71 and moved as high as $115 before the rally burned out. Following this, the market cap of the digital asset moved up rapidly, beating out some heavy hitters in the space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Go On $2.15 Billion Buying Spree, Is It Time To Sell? Currently, the market cap of the altcoin is sitting above $7.1 billion, despite the price falling back below the $100 level. Its market cap now makes it the 10th-largest cryptocurrency in the market, coming out ahead of the likes of Polygon (MATIC), Tron (TRX), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Litecoin’s standing now makes it the seventh most valuable cryptocurrency in the market when stablecoins are removed from the top 10. This move has also solidified Litecoin’s position as an important player, despite its price correction. LTC price hits local high of $115 before correction | Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com Could Litecoin Run Further From Here? The biggest bull case for the price of LTC is the Litecoin halving event that is coming up. Only 20 days away from now, investors are already gearing up for what is expected to be a very significant event. These expectations also naturally extend to the price and this could be the reason that the digital asset’s price continues to rise. Just the anticipation from the last month alone has seen the price cross $115 at its local high. But as the event draws closer and this bullish sentiment continues, the LTC price could quickly reclaim this price and run another 50%. LTC halving event happening in 20 days | Source: Litecoin Halving In one instance, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has predicted that LTC could rally as high as $200 off the halving event alone. If this happens, then investors could be looking at gains of over 100% just from the current bounce-off point. However, one concern is that the Litecoin halving could end up being a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ event. Examples of this have been the Cardano Alonzo upgrade in 2021 and Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade in 2023. Related Reading: Analysts Puts Bitcoin At $125,000 By 2024, How Is This Possible? In both of these cases, the token prices rallied in the weeks leading up to the event but eventually fell flat and retraced once the event was completed. So if Litecoin ends up in the same trend, then it would be best to sell in the weeks leading up to the event. For now, LTC’s price is still holding steady at $97, despite nursing 8.09% losses on the 7-day chart.

However, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin and LINK experienced slight gains on their charts. Related Reading: Celsius Takes Legal Action Against StakeHound For Withholding $150 Million LINK saw a 1.5% increase, and its weekly chart indicated consolidation. The altcoin’s technical outlook seems to favor the bulls. Demand and accumulation were in the positive zone, indicating increased buying strength. While LINK painted bullish signals, it is important to note that the bullish sentiment is limited to its shorter time frame, and the higher time frame suggests a bearish sentiment. If Bitcoin retraces below $30,500, LINK is expected to fall below its local support level, invalidating bullishness. It remains crucial for LINK to surpass overhead resistance. The market capitalization of LINK has been increasing, indicating the control of buyers in the market. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LINK is currently trading at $6.26, below the rigid resistance of $6.50. The level above acts as the overhead ceiling for the altcoin. Despite breaking out of the bearish trendline (green), LINK has been unable to overcome immediate resistance as it remains largely bearish on the higher time frame. The rejection at $6.50 has resulted in selling pressure, which could resume if LINK fails to move above immediate resistance. A fall from the present price level would cause the coin to drop below $6 and approach $5.80. Technical Analysis Demand for LINK rose as the coin moved from the $6 level. However, sellers are expected to take over if the price action stalls again. The Relative Strength Index has moved away from the 50-mark, indicating an increase in buyers. Additionally, the price is currently above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, suggesting that buyers are driving the price momentum in the market. As demand for LINK increased, investor confidence also grew. The Chaikin Money Flow, which measures capital inflows vs. outflows, is currently above the half-line, indicating that capital inflows are higher than outflows. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reflects price momentum and reversals. However, the indicator has formed red histograms on the half-line, signaling the onset of bearish action and potential sell signals for the altcoin. Related Reading: Polygon Volume Registers Sharp Increase, What Does It Mean? Therefore, it is crucial for LINK to break past the $6.50 resistance level; otherwise, the bears will have full control over the asset.

42393146,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGPbf,1689194674,"Bitcoin Shrugs Off Solid Inflation Report, Holds Steady Over $30K","Bitcoin investors were unfazed by today’s crypto report.  While hourly price charts showed an uptick in volatility, the daily price frame showed the opposite.  Personal Consumption Expenditure data appears more pertinent to the FOMC than does CPI.  After a brief bout of volatility, bitcoin brushed off positive inflation data in Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index report for June. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $30,300, down less than a percentage point over the past 24 hours.  U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2% in June, beating expectations for a 0.3% increase. Core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices also surpassed forecasts, rising 4.8% versus consensus estimates of 5%. The overall inflation rate in the U.S. is now 3% compared to 9.1% in June 2022.  The upbeat inflation news should have logically sent bitcoin higher in the immediate aftermath, but instead the price declined, even as volatility spiked.  BTC’s price ranged from a high of $31,122 to a low of $30,575, although BTC’s hourly candles fluctuated between red and green like a malfunctioning traffic light. BTC and other cryptos’ sluggish performance may reflect the lessening impact of CPI compared to other inflation data on crypto markets compared to other inflation data and of traditional finance (TradFi) indicators that previously weighed on investors.  One data point, two time horizons  Investors’ view of Wednesday’s market is likely colored by their preferred time frame. While bitcoin’s hourly chart displays volatile price moves grappling with today’s CPI news, its daily price chart implies the opposite, with range-bound trading, and declining volatility.  Bitcoin’s daily price wasn’t the only thing that shrugged at today’s data point. Per the CME Fedwatch tool, expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would raise rates 25 basis points on July 26 are 94.9%, versus 93% a day prior.     Today’s report appeared to change nothing specific to the FOMC’s upcoming policy decision, and BTC prices are reacting as such. Major equity indexes traded higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 all increasing.  Still crypto markets have largely decoupled from TradFi during 2023, with only the most surprising economic reports moving markets significantly.  While we watch CPI, the Fed seems to prefer PCE  While CPI gets a lot of attention, the FOMC’s favored measure of inflation appears to be U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). In the most recent release of FOMC minutes, PCE is mentioned 10 times compared to three mentions of CPI.

42393129,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGOMj,1689192880,It's Time for a Euro Stablecoin,"The recently approved Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is expected to provide much needed regulatory clarity and serve as a standard for global crypto regulations. But besides spurring a new wave of development in the industry, perhaps one of the most promising results of the new framework is that it will finally make a European stablecoin possible – something that has been long overdue.  Fiat-backed stablecoins are mostly a one player game right now with U.S. dollar-denominated options taken as the default in most crypto transactions. But this preference for the greenback no longer reflects the realities of a multipolar global economy.  Kevin de Patoul is the CEO and co-founder of Keyrock, a digital asset market maker.  There are growing concerns around the United States economy, which was rocked by pandemic-led shutdowns and now inflation. Likewise, international efforts such as the launch of a BRICS digital currency are looking to challenge dollar dominance. (BRICS stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.)  In this context, a sound alternative in the form of euro-backed stablecoins for crypto markets is more than welcome. It would inject much needed competition in today's crypto markets.  Now is the time  But why hasn’t a viable euro stablecoin happened already? So far, the absence of a widely adopted euro-backed stablecoin has been due to two factors: negative interest rates and regulatory burdens.  Negative interest rates in the eurozone have made it difficult for a fiat-backed stablecoin to emerge given that traders often what to earn yield for taking on risk. And stablecoins, no matter how stable, do carry risks.  However, the situation have changed. The European Central Bank (ECB) ended this 11-year monetary policy experiment in 2022 as it prepared to face the economic impact of the Ukraine war.  In terms of regulatory burdens, MiCA classifies stablecoins as e-money tokens (EMT) or significant e-money tokens (SEMT) if they become large enough. This implies that organizations need to be fully registered and compliant when MiCA comes into force in 2024 in order to issue a euro-backed stablecoin and offer it to European counterparties.  Read more: Michael Casey - The Real Use Case for CBDCs: Dethroning the Dollar| Opinion  For a long time, this might have been a hurdle compared to other, more lax, regulatory environments. However, recent crypto crackdowns in the U.S. have shown that, while MiCA might be more strict on the issuance of stablecoins, it has the merit of being clear and providing stability.  An organization launching a stablecoin today might find it relatively more attractive to work under the MiCA framework. Clear rules and guidelines are preferable to the arbitrary regulation by enforcement seen in the United States.  This has important downstream implications for companies and individuals. For example, finding suitable banking partners was very difficult a few years ago. Now it would be completely feasible, especially for a player that’s fully compliant with MiCA.  Why euro stablecoins are necessary  But a euro-based stablecoin would not just be nice to have, it’s something that is essential to the future health of European crypto markets. Moreover, the euro is an equally important currency in the worldwide economy. It’s not only used in the so-called eurozone but also massively adopted in international trade.  However, European startups have been in a position where they implicitly rely on the stability of the U.S. economy. Having a digital euro provides all the same benefits of dollar-pegged stablecoins (global reach, cheap fees, transaction finality, etc.), without the foreign exchange exposure. Lessening counterparty risk would ultimately benefit the market as a whole.  See also: Nic Carter - America's Quiet Default | Opinion  A euro-backed stablecoin also provides regulatory diversification, so to speak. It would help broaden access to a stable region that is not subject to the whims of overzealous U.S. politicians and regulators.  What happens after launch?  The emergence of one or many euro-backed stablecoins is only a matter of time. What we can expect after that is that the balance between euro and dollar stablecoins in circulation will be similar to the proportion of euros and dollars in the regular fiat economy. This means that there will be far fewer euro stablecoins exchanging hands, due to the immense demand for dollars.  However, if the U.S. manages to completely rule itself out of the growth of digital assets markets (for lack of regulatory clarity), it will make the E.U. a much more attractive jurisdiction. That would create tremendous growth for euro-denominated stablecoins.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) increasingly hostile stance against crypto is offering the European Union a chance to build a significant edge in crypto. And with no consensus in sight for crypto regulation in the United States, the ongoing challenge to the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the real economy could soon extend to the world of digital assets.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Kevin de Patoul ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/12/its-time-for-a-euro-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4ebe49e67cc83c1192b0be9e714cae879276a59-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In response to Whale Alert’s tweet announcing Tether’s 1 billion USDT inventory replenishment on the Tron Network, Tether’s CTO Paulo Adoino replied in a tweet stating that the issuance was authorized but not yet issued, indicating that the tokens will serve as inventory for future issuance requests and chain swaps.

USDT Growing Dominance: Market Cap Soars Amidst Stablecoin Shifts Amidst the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, Tether’s market dominance is becoming increasingly evident. Recent data from Coinecko reveals that over the past 90 days, USDT’s market capitalization has surged by $2.6 billion, highlighting its growing importance in the cryptocurrency landscape. In stark contrast, USD Coin (USDC), another major stablecoin, has experienced a decline of $4.6 billion in its market capitalization during the same period. USDT is the largest stablecoin with over $83 billion market cap | Source: Market Cap USDT on TradingView.com These figures indicate a significant shift in market dynamics, with USDT emerging as the leading stablecoin in terms of market cap. With around 65% of the total market cap of stablecoins, Tether continues to solidify its position as a trusted and widely adopted digital currency. What This Means For The Crypto Market A large influx of stablecoins into the crypto market can often serve as a bullish indicator for digital assets in the space. This is because the more USDT is available in the market, the more buying power is present. A Tuesday report on the on-chain data analytics platform Santiment points to this where investors were advised to keep an eye out for the supply of stablecoins on exchanges. According to the report, an increase in stablecoins such as USDT and USDC could mean that something is “brewing” in the market. Related Reading: Conflux (CFX) Climbs By 11% As Bank of China Begins Sim Card Payment With Digital Yuan In the case of the newly minted USDT, if the majority of the stablecoins find their way to centralized exchanges, then it could mean that investors are looking to move into more volatile cryptocurrencies. In such a scenario, the rising demand would translate into a bullish rally for assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, triggering a bull run.

On-chain data suggest that a massive amount of funds tied to the marketplace is on the move, with more than 9,000 Bitcoin (BTC) recently transferred from two Silk Road-related addresses. The addresses in question are suspected to have been seized by the US Department of Justice. US Government BTC On The Move? The latest transfer of funds follows the seizure of over 50,000 Bitcoin from James Zhong, who recently pled guilty to wire fraud for unlawfully obtaining the Bitcoin from the Silk Road dark web marketplace in 2012. Law enforcement seized the Bitcoin from Zhong’s home in Gainesville, Georgia, in November 2021, in what was the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the history of the US Department of Justice. Related Reading: Celsius Takes Legal Action Against StakeHound For Withholding $150 Million According to court filings, Zhong created a string of Silk Road accounts to conceal his identity, triggering over 140 transactions in rapid succession to trick Silk Road’s withdrawal-processing system into releasing approximately 50,000 BTC into his accounts. He then transferred the Bitcoin into separate addresses under his control, all in a manner designed to prevent detection and obfuscate the Bitcoin’s source. Zhong’s possession of the 50,000 Bitcoin led to him receiving 50,000 Bitcoin Cash in a hard fork coin split in August 2017. He then exchanged all the BCH Crime Proceeds for additional Bitcoin, amounting to approximately 3,500 Bitcoin of additional crime proceeds. By the last quarter of 2017, Zhong possessed roughly 53,500 Bitcoin of total crime proceeds. In March 2022, Zhong began voluntarily surrendering to the government additional Bitcoin that he had access to and had not dissipated. In total, he surrendered 1,004.14621836 additional Bitcoin. The US government had previously sold 9,800 Bitcoin in March 2022, with plans to sell another 41,500 BTC. However, the recent transfer of more than 9,000 BTC from the Silk Road-related addresses has raised questions about the fate of the remaining seized Bitcoin. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy? As previously reported by NewsBTC, the US government plans to sell the remaining 41,500 BTC in connection with the Silk Road case. The US government has been selling the confiscated BTC in batches since then, and the upcoming sale of 41,500 BTC could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. If there is no demand for Bitcoin when the US government sells the remaining BTC, it could lead to a drop in Bitcoin’s price. This is because the sudden influx of BTC into the market could create an oversupply, which could overwhelm the existing demand. As a result, the market price of BTC could fall, leading to a temporary drop in the cryptocurrency’s value. Related Reading: Polygon Volume Registers Sharp Increase, What Does It Mean? However, it’s important to note that the impact of the government’s BTC sale on the market is not entirely predictable. If buyers are willing to purchase the BTC at the offered price, then the market may not experience much volatility. On the other hand, if demand for BTC is strong and buyers are willing to pay a premium for the confiscated BTC, the sale could push BTC prices higher. Despite these concerns, BTC appears to be regaining its bullish momentum, attempting to breach the $31,000 mark. If BTC can consolidate above this resistance level, it could signal a potential upward trend in the cryptocurrency’s value. Currently, BTC is trading at $30,700, which is the same price level as it was in the 24-hour timeframe from July 11th. BTC’s support floor at $30,000 has been holding up well, despite poor price action. This could serve as a threshold for Bitcoin bulls in case of another failed attempt to breach the upper resistance lines in the short term.

42393139,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGPH9,1689188368,"Even as Inflation Risk Fades, Bitcoin Remains Stuck Below $31K","Bitcoin (BTC) investors received what should have been welcome economic news Wednesday as the government reported a big slowdown in U.S. inflation.  And, indeed, bitcoin's price quickly shot up to almost $31,000 following the report. It didn't last long. As of press time, BTC had pulled back below $30,500, down more than 1% from where it was before the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released.  The report showed consumer prices increased 3% year-over-year in June, versus the 4% gain in May. Even better, the core rate – which excludes food and energy prices – slowed to a 4.8% increase after stubbornly holding above 5% earlier in 2023.  To the extent that speedy inflation has been among the headwinds sending bitcoin tumbling from its peak near $70,000 in November 2021, fading inflation risks would seemingly be supportive. That this didn't happen today brings forth a few issues.  Federal Reserve  First, perhaps it's another in what's been a number of inflation head fakes in the Covid era. Remember 2021's ""transitory"" phase in which the U.S. Federal Reserve was convinced it didn't need to act on rising inflation due to its expectation that it was a temporary blip? Commenting on this morning's CPI, The Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos was reminded of inflation reports in July and August 2021, which seemed to confirm that hypothesis before subsequent data said otherwise. Timiraos doesn't expect the Fed to be swayed from its path of additional rate hikes in 2023 by just this morning's data.  Bitcoin from Silk Road  Second, there was more news today than just the CPI print. On-chain data this morning showed two wallets labeled as belonging to the U.S. government and linked to seized bitcoin holdings from the Silk Road marketplace moved 9,825 bitcoin ($301 million) in three transactions. That sort of selling pressure may have more than balanced out any good inflation news.  Anticipating the U.S. inflation slowdown?  Finally, markets anticipate. The price of bitcoin has risen more than 20% since mid-June. While the catalyst for that is commonly thought to be the BlackRock spot ETF application (and subsequent filings by a number of other asset managers, including Fidelity), perhaps some of the bullish action was due to markets sniffing out the improved June inflation report. As Timiraos further noted, observers had been talking about sizable softening in some of the CPI components for some time.  Conventional markets  Maybe doubly frustrating the bitcoin bulls today is that traditional markets appear to have fully embraced the weaker inflation report. The dollar index is off more than 1%, which is exactly what one might expect if inflation concerns and subsequently the chances of future Fed rate hikes were receding. The 10-year Treasury yield is off a full 13 basis points (0.13%) to 3.84% and the two-year yield is down the same amount to 4.74%. And while bitcoin resides in the red on Wednesday, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are ahead by about 1% and hitting new all-time highs.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/12/even-as-inflation-risk-fades-bitcoin-remains-stuck-below-31k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eaf6faac04c2e0aae8460d23d21e63c6fcf5f5cf-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14815313,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542364,1689184823,Bitcoin Stuck In Tight Range: Will BTC Decompress With A Big Move?,"Data shows Bitcoin has been stuck in a historically tight 14-day range recently, something that has decompressed into big moves in the past. Bitcoin 14-Day Range Has Been Extremely Narrow Recently According to data from the analytics firm Glassnode, the 14-day range has only been narrower than now during less than 2% of the cryptocurrency’s entire trading life. The “14-day range” here refers to the percentage difference between the top and bottom recorded in the Bitcoin price during the past two weeks. This indicator can tell us about how volatile the asset’s price has been recently. When its value is high, it means that the coin has observed a large amount of fluctuation within the last fourteen days, and thus, the price has registered high volatility. On the other hand, low values of the metric imply the cryptocurrency hasn’t been that volatile as its price has moved by only a low percentage during the past couple of weeks. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin 14-day range over the entire history of the asset: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite low in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As highlighted in the above graph, the Bitcoin 14-day range is currently at a value of just 4.6%, which means that the local high and low within the past two weeks have differed by just 4.6%. This is an extremely low value when compared to what has generally been the norm for BTC. In the chart, Glassnode has also marked the instances where the indicator has observed even lower values than right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Braces For CPI Figures: Will BTC Rally Or Retreat Today? As can be seen from the purple bars, there have only been very few occurrences where Bitcoin has traded inside a narrower range. In terms of the numbers, only 2,176 hours in the lifetime of the asset have registered lower values of the metric, which are equivalent to about 1.9% of the entire trading life of the oldest cryptocurrency. An interesting pattern has historically followed whenever the indicator has recorded such low values of the 14-day range. From the graph, it’s visible that Bitcoin has usually succeeded in these periods of extremely low volatility with a violent move. Related Reading: Bitcoin And NASDAQ Composite Index Correlation Drops To A 2-Year Low This violent move can be towards either direction, as both crashes and rallies have followed a narrow range. Though, curiously, the majority of these moves have been towards the upside. The latest occurrence of this pattern was way back in January, right before the current rally initially started. It would appear that back then as well, the tight range exploded into a sharp upwards move. If history is anything to go by, the current low values of the 14-day range may mean that another sharp Bitcoin move may be likely to take place in the near future. And naturally, if precedence is to consider, such a move may be more probable to be towards the up direction. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,900, up 1% in the last week.

14813824,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542379,1689181203,FTT Up By 21% Despite FTX Claims Portal Troubles,"FTT, the native token of the controversial FTX ecosystem, has been pumping lately. This recent price upswing was triggered by the launch of a customer claims portal, an online platform for customers to access their account information and submit electronic proof of claims in FTX’s restructuring proceedings. Although the portal became unavailable barely an hour after launch, the price of FTT has managed to stay afloat, with a 21% increase in the last day. FTX Claims Portal Goes Offline For Unknown Reasons Last month, the debtors in FTX’s insolvency case announced that an online claims portal was in the final stages of launch. The portal reportedly went live on Tuesday, July 11, enabling customers of the bankrupt crypto exchange to access their account information. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ecosystem Token BONE Surges 88%, Too Late To Buy? The platform – before going offline – said users can access their account balance as of November 11, 2022 – the day FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States. Then, if required, customers would also be able to submit an electronic proof of claim with the FTX Debtors’ claims and noticing agent (Kroll Restructuring Administration). However, the claims portal only stayed live for about an hour before going down for unknown reasons. As of this writing, there has been no official statement from FTX addressing the crash. That said, it is worth noting that customers still have until September 29, 2023, to file a claim. This can be done via alternative means besides the website, like through US mail. FTT Rallies 21% In A Single Day – Price Overview After the FTX claims portal went live yesterday, the FTX token (FTT) received a lot of attention from crypto enthusiasts. And the token’s price showed a positive reaction, gaining more than 24% roughly an hour after the launch. However, this price surge was short-lived, as the FTT token soon shed a considerable chunk of its early gain. This is understood to be in response to the claims portal going offline. It is worth noting that FTT has been on a positive run in recent weeks. According to CoinGecko data, the token’s value has increased by nearly 117% in the past month. That said, it appears that FTT won’t be staying down for long. The cryptocurrency looks set to touch the previous 24-hour high of $1.79 again, with a 6.7% price increase in the last hour.

South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) issued draft rules requiring companies holding or issuing cryptocurrencies to disclose their holdings in financial statements from 2024. Local Crypto Firms to Disclose Holdings In a press statement, the FSC said firms would have to disclose information about their holdings' characteristics, quantities, business models and internal accounting policies. Additionally, domestic companies must disclose information regarding profits, book value, and the market value of their cryptocurrencies. The new accounting standards are expected to take effect in January 2024. In its statement, the FCA said: The government is enhancing accounting transparency in virtual asset transactions by requiring companies to disclose detailed information, following the passage of the Virtual Assets Act in the parliament on June 30. South Korean lawmakers passed legislation that protects investors and grants the FSC and The Bank of Korea the power to oversee crypto operators and asset custodians. The newly enacted Virtual Asset Users Protection Act also authorizes the power to impose penalties and liabilities for damages caused by unfair trading practices. Guidelines Seek to Provide Accounting Clarity Until now, firms and their auditors differed in their view regarding the timing and criteria for determining whether the sale of virtual assets to customers constituted profit. Under the FSC's new rules, if companies sell assets, the sale will be regarded as profit after the company fulfils obligations to its holder.

42393138,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGP6t,1689180731,"Digitex Founder Ordered to Pay $16M to Resolve CFTC Action, Banned From Trading","The founder of crypto exchange Digitex, Adam Todd, has been ordered by a federal court to pay almost $16 million to resolve accusations that he ran an illegal platform and sought to manipulate its native token, DGTX, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said in a Wednesday statement.  In concluding what had been the CFTC’s first case that accused a decentralized-finance (DeFi) platform for failing to register as an exchange, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida found Todd violated several commodities laws in running the Florida-based Digitex Futures exchange, and the judge ordered he be banned from trading in CFTC-regulated markets. Todd faces a $12 million fine and about $4 million in disgorgement, though it’s unclear whether Todd or the company would have the resources to pay back customers.  “This order resolves yet another action against an individual and digital asset exchange illegally offering futures contracts to U.S. customers,” said Ian McGinley, the CFTC’s enforcement director, in a statement. He noted the court also found that Todd had “attempted to manipulate Digitex’s native utility token, DGTX, by allegedly ‘pumping’ the token’s price through the use of a computerized bot.”  Todd has still been active as a developer of Digitex Games, which utilizes the DGTX token.  “I didn't steal customer funds or mislead investors or run a Ponzi or pretend there was a non-existent product or anything like that,” Todd said in an email to CoinDesk. “I started a cryptocurrency which reached a market cap of $160 million and which then crashed because our product couldn't compete in a saturated market. That's it. And now I have a $16 million fine for my efforts.”  He said his company tried to keep out U.S. customers, and he argued it wasn't ever possible for it to register with the CFTC.  “I've rebranded to Digitex Games, which is a fully non-custodial and decentralized betting and trading platform that will utilize the DGTX token,” he said. “All betting will be done on-chain, and the CFTC will have no perceived or actual jurisdiction over anything the platform does.”  UPDATE (July 12, 2023, 23:07 UTC): Updates with comments from Adam Todd.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/12/digitex-founder-ordered-to-pay-16m-to-resolve-cftc-action-banned-from-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba52f7bccf2ae307a3c4c7efe5945ed295f5380d-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393128,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGOHb,1689180179,Want a Spot Market Bitcoin ETF? Then Deal With the Consequences,"Two weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) thought the recent spate of applications for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) were inadequate because they weren’t clear and comprehensive.  The SEC wanted the filings to name the exchange that would carry out the surveillance-sharing agreements (SSA) mentioned in the original filings. These SSAs are supposed to show the SEC that potential bitcoin ETF issuers are able to detect fraud and manipulation in the bitcoin market.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The specific addition of an SSA to these applications is widely viewed as the key to finally getting the bitcoin ETF approved in the United States. Some analysts predict an ETF that tracks that spot market value of bitcoin (as opposed to existing futures-based ETFs) would lead to greater institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency.  Many of the applicants reacted quickly to the SEC and all named Coinbase (COIN) as the exchange that would oversee surveillance on the bitcoin market for them and refiled. On its face, a great choice. Coinbase is a publicly traded company and has a far less sketchy reputation than most other crypto exchanges.  But, is Coinbase the right choice? It might not be.  It doesn't matter if Coinbase is the right choice  The spot bitcoin ETF has been denied by the SEC multiple times from multiple potential issuers. Previously the SEC stated that those denials were in part due to a lack of something like an SSA. According to those denials, the SEC would want to see an information sharing agreement between the stock exchange the ETF is listed on and a spot bitcoin exchange that is both 1) of significant size and 2) regulated.  On the former point, Coinbase is not the largest spot bitcoin exchange. It currently sees somewhere around 2.5% of global daily trading volume, according to BTC/USD trading pair data from CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. You can quibble about the details, bitcoin trading exchange volumes could also include trading pairs between many currencies, crypto or otherwise.  And so, the roughly $400 million that represents daily BTC/USD trading on Coinbase is probably adequate to “surveil” the market.  Read more: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Application Takes Surveillance to the Next Level  In honesty though, that’s probably not where the issue will lie. In honesty though, that’s probably not where the issue of the SEC's approval will lie.  Instead, the SEC will likely approve or deny the recent ETF applications based on its understanding of Coinbase being “regulated.” I’m sure the SEC will be over the moon to find that a firm it’s bickering with in court is the proposed market surveillance provider for the likes of Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. The court squabble has nothing to do with the bitcoin market, but still, it’s a consideration.  The thing is: Coinbase’s fit for this role is all a bit unclear.  As my colleague Nik De pointed out in CoinDesk’s ""State of Crypto"" newsletter, the SEC said in a 2019 order that the bitcoin market had too much potential for manipulation and “there needed to be a ‘surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size relating to the underlying assets’ to deter any potential manipulation.”  There is, unfortunately, no exact definition of a “regulated market” and “significant size.” So yes, it’s unclear.  The bigger point amid all this ETF talk is that Coinbase is not a shoo in as an adequate data provider partner.  The unfortunate truth is that the natural progression of this conversation is going to leak into taking surveillance to the next level via an information-sharing agreement. As CoinDesk’s Ian Allison puts it:  “... what’s more likely to influence the SEC’s decision is an information-sharing deal that flips the position of power in the arrangement and gives regulators the right to demand extra background.”  Now this is different.  An information-sharing deal would allow the SEC to request specific information about an end client’s trading history of the spot bitcoin ETF superseding the surveillance provider telling the regulator that “everything’s a-OK, Captain.”  Critically, an information-sharing agreement could also include personal information such as a customer’s name and address. This may not bode well for privacy advocates in crypto. However, it is also the completely unsurprising end state of bringing a spot bitcoin ETF to market, or perhaps any financialization of crypto.

42393131,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGOWz,1689179400,"Google Play Changes Policy on Tokenized Digital Assets, Allowing NFTs in Apps and Games","Google Play announced a major shift in policy today, allowing developers to incorporate digital assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into their apps and games in the store. Companies that decide to offer the ability to buy, sell or earn tokenized assets will be required to make it clear in the Play Console that there are blockchain-based elements in the app.  In a blog post shared with CoinDesk, Joseph Mills, Google Play’s Group Product Manager, wrote that this will allow partners to reimagine “traditional games with user-owned content” and boost “user loyalty through unique NFT rewards.”  Reddit, which has seen enormous success with its Avatar NFTs, was one of the partners working with Google on the new policy. Matt Williamson, Reddit’s senior engineering manager, was quoted in the post as saying that the updated guidelines are “aimed at creating a level playing field that promotes user trust, and responsible usage of blockchain technology.”  The post by Mills stressed the importance of user trust, noting “while tokenized assets are meant to build more enriched, immersive experiences, as an added user protection, developers may not promote or glamorize any potential earning from playing or trading activities.” This maintains Google Plays’ Real-Money Gambling, Games, and Contests policy. In effect, this means apps that haven’t met gambling eligibility requirements can’t promote buying an in-game item like a “loot box” for a chance to win NFTs.  Previously, Google’s policy on blockchain-based apps had been characterized as a “black box” with games like “Bitcoin Blast” getting kicked out of the Play Store in 2021 without a clear explanation. In 2018, the store banned crypto mining apps, a rule which will not change with the new guidelines.  Overall, the company has signaled a shift in attitude towards Web3 recently, allowing ArDrive Mobile, an app for decentralized data storage, to appear in the store in 2022 as well as allowing Axie Infinity: Origins to be listed in select Google Play markets. In parallel, Google Cloud announced an initiative in April 2023 to help Web3 developers accelerate their startups.  A spokesperson from Google Play told CoinDesk that users may see the first tests of the new experiences in late summer as they work with an initial group of developers, and that the new policy will roll out in full later this year.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, CFX has gained by 11.39% in the last 24 hours, emerging as the day’s top gainer. So what’s driving this price gain? Bank of China Announces SIM Card NFC Payments, Sparks Excitement In The Conflux Community. On July 10, The Bank of China announced it would be commencing the testing of SIM card-linked payments using the digital renminbi – known as digital yuan – starting from July 11- yesterday. According to its statement, the state-owned bank claims to be conducting this program in collaboration with telecommunications giants China Telecom and China Unicom. Related Reading: Conflux (CFX) Sheds 16% Despite $18 Million Investment From DWF Labs The project aims to enable payments using a near-field communication protocol (NFC) and a technology known as “super SIM cards.” Basically, users will be able to process digital yuan payments by bringing their mobile phones in contact with designated payment terminals. That said, following the emergence of this news in mainstream social media today, there has been a wave of excitement in the CFX community, with some hinting that the latest move by the Bank of China could boost the adoption of CFX in the future. For context, the Conflux Network signed a partnership with China Telecom to develop a Blockchain-powered SIM card (BSIM) back in May 2023. Given this, it appears that some CFX fans believe the Conflux Network will play a significant role in the new SIM Card e-CNY payment system. The excitement in the CFX community translated into positive price movement, with CFX surging by 11% this morning to hit a peak price of $0.2031. Prior to this price increase, CFX had seen its market price fall from $0.197 to as low as $0.175 over the last seven days. At the time of writing, CFX is currently trading at $0.201 with a 0.20% loss in the last hour. However, the token’s trading volume has risen 135.79% and is valued at $75.4 million. With a market cap of $617.6 million, Conflux is ranked as the 67th biggest cryptocurrency on the market.

Crypto is adding new users at a pace so similar to the internet’s 1990s growth that it can fuel stunning forecasts for what’s ahead for digital assets.  The internet went from basically no users in 1990 to 5 billion now – capturing 62.5% of the global population in 33 years. If crypto follows a similar curve, it would hit 5 billion users around 2047, assuming no population growth, and, say, 6 billion given predicted population growth.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Before you get too excited, though, I’d argue that’s too optimistic.  The internet is too broad for comparison. It’s used for everything in our lives. Crypto has many use cases, and there is hope for Web3, but for the average consumer, crypto is either a speculative investment or a means of transferring value.  I recommend a bottom-up approach to analyze adoption, looking at consumer behaviors from comparable use cases.  Consider the adoption of financial services technologies:  Mobile Banking: This was introduced through banking via text message in 1997 and the first mobile banking app in 2007. In 2021, McKinsey reported that among all bank customers, only 52% of North Americans, 47% of Western Europeans and 45% of Central Europeans used mobile banking. This is consistent with a 2023 Cornerstone Advisors report stating 56% of checking account holders are active mobile banking users. It’s important to note that only 76% of the global population has a bank account.  Stock Investing: Gallup found that 61% of Americans report owning stock and Pew Research reports only 35% of Americans own stock outside of their retirement accounts. And in-person touchpoints are important, with Chase sharing that 85% of first-time investors come from banker referrals.  What do these numbers tell us?  People take decades to adopt what many of us in the finance industry consider basic financial technologies. And crypto is not basic.  Seeing that less than 50% of the world uses something as simple as mobile banking 26 years after its debut, coupled with the fact that only about a third of Americans actively invest in stocks (the New York Stock Exchange opened in 1792), should make us question crypto’s growth trajectory beyond early adopters.  Even with population growth, crypto may struggle to reach 5 billion users by 2047. More detailed analysis is needed, but with the continued digitalization of our traditional banking system, I think a more conservative back-of-the-envelope estimate is a range of 2 billion to 3 billion users, and that’s if regulation doesn’t get in the way.

Believe it or not, as the event progressed, thoughts of digital assets crossed my mind.  Admittedly, baseball and crypto don’t have the most tangible (or even tangential) of connections, but that’s how my mind works sometimes. (I'm also an avid sports fan.)  At any rate, anyone familiar with drafts knows that teams select players based on what they believe they will accomplish later. This happens in essentially every sport that graces the television screen.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Baseball differs from some of its professional league counterparts because players drafted today may not see a major league field for 3-4 years – if not longer. Between draft day and debut day, years are spent in lower leagues, for development.  While bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other established digital assets are like veteran stars, altcoins are like recently drafted players. They are, for all intents and purposes, prospects, with a long road ahead before they find success – if they ever do.  But how does one evaluate a prospect in cryptocurrencies? What’s even worth looking at, and where does one start?  For better or worse, my starting point for this is developer activity. I view that as a sign of protocol growth and a signal of where developers have chosen to allocate their intellectual capital. The general thesis being that where development occurs, value accrual and price appreciation may follow.  My source data comes via venture capital firm Electric Capital’s developer report, which aims to “quantify the developer activity” happening across crypto and Web3 ecosystems.  Here’s what I found:  New developers are leaving crypto  Before you can evaluate a prospect, it helps to see if anyone is even interested in the game. A quick look at Google search trends shows that searches for both “bitcoin” and “cryptocurrencies” are half as prevalent as they were a year ago. Also, there’s been a 22% decline in active developers across the entire space since over the past year and an 8% contraction since January, according to Electric Capital’s report. “New developers” decreased 18% since January, worse than the overall number, implying newcomers drove the retreat.  A wider lens is less dire, though, showing 26% and 92% increases over the past two and three years, respectively. While the overall trend has been higher, the challenges facing crypto over the most recent 12 months had an understandably negative impact on newer developers, while those operating in the space for more than 12 months have stayed the course.  Additionally, while my initial thought was that development growth leads price acceleration, I think the jury may actually be out on that since BTC has zoomed higher amid this year’s contraction.  I suspect that it may be bifurcated, where increases in price lead to increases in developer activity for bitcoin and ether, with the opposite being the case for smaller, lesser-known protocols.  Still, some crypto protocols have shown massive growth  Of the 20 ecosystems with the largest number of total developers, three have shown positive growth year-over-year, with two having tradable tokens:  Osmosis (OSMO)  one-year developer growth: 56%  two-year developer growth: 296%  Osmosis, an interchain decentralized exchange (DEX) built using the Cosmo software development kit, led the way with its 56% growth in total developers over the past year. Monthly activity was strong as well, with a 26% increase between May and June.  But the price of its native token OSMO has not followed suit, falling 27% so far in 2023 and 36% over the most recent 90 days. However, 30-day performance for OSMO has been stronger, with its price rising 7%.  The divergence between activity and price could present a compelling opportunity for investors looking to get on the front end of a protocol showing signs of increased developer interest.  Optimism (OP)  one-year developer growth: 27%  two-year developer growth: 327%  Optimism, a layer-2 blockchain, showed strong growth as well. It aims to be a swift scaling solution for decentralized applications built on Ethereum, at a lower cost. The performance of OP, its governance token, has actually outpaced developer growth, increasing 127% year-over-year. But it has been weak recently, falling 47% over the last 90 days.  Starknet  one-year developer growth: 4%  two-year developer growth: 590%  Closing out the list is layer-2 network Starknet, whose token is not available for sale at the moment. Still, given the influx of new developers working on the protocol, it bears mentioning.  While hardly the only method for identifying prospects, the number of developers working on a protocol and the speed at which that figure goes is a good starting point, in my view. As more innovation, efficiency and value works its way through, it may go a long way in identifying the next veteran.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  BLACKROCK TURNABOUT: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was pretty clearly a crypto skeptic at one point. But he’s now steering the world’s largest asset manager in a different direction, recently applying to list a bitcoin ETF. And, last week, Fink told Fox Business that bitcoin could “revolutionize finance.” Here’s a nice story explaining how the industry is thinking about this turnabout.  HERE WE GO: Even though bitcoin (BTC) has been soaring in 2023, it’s not like confidence has been really booming in the overall crypto space. It’s hard to be excited about the future when the U.S. government keeps going after industry leaders and just generally gets heavy-handed about digital assets. But, in a return to the rah-rah days of yesterday, analysts at Standard Chartered Bank have a very bullish view. They see BTC’s price rising to $50,000 by the end of this year (versus around $30,000 currently) and hitting $120,000 by the end of 2024. These kinds of price forecasts from big banks aren’t exactly bulletproof. It’s hard to get them right. Yet, this one in particular is noteworthy given just how dour things have been.  PRIVACY: Many crypto veterans and idealists love privacy. A trio of stories this week are, therefore, sure to rankle them. A data firm called Arkham Intelligence gets on the list twice: First, with a new product designed to unmask otherwise-anonymous crypto wallets. As word of this service spread, it emerged that Arkham had already been leaking the email addresses of their clients.

14809340,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/the-top-7-aml-tools-for-the-crypto-industry,1689177328,The Top 7 AML Tools For The Crypto Industry,"With industry-wide crackdowns from the likes of the SEC and exacting regulatory demands coming into force in Europe, it’s never been more crucial to implement proper AML procedures. The crypto industry has received bad press from various mainstream media sources citing how crypto can be used for all kinds of nefarious practices, money laundering in particular. Be that as it may, cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, and therefore transactions are inherently transparent, and the trail of a suspected wrongdoer can usually be followed. However, there are always ways and means that a bad actor, who wishes to circumvent anti-money laundering (AML) processes, can employ. One key aspect of AML compliance is the implementation of transaction monitoring systems, such as Know Your Transaction (KYT). KYT involves real-time monitoring of individual transactions to identify suspicious activities, while the verification of addresses helps assess the legitimacy of wallet addresses involved in cryptocurrency transactions, mitigating risks associated with high-risk entities. In a September 2022 article, the World Economic Forum (WEF) reported a 1,964% increase in cryptocurrencies that are laundered by way of decentralised finance (DeFi). This percentage was equivalent to around $900 million in laundered value. To combat this type of activity, blockchain analytics tools and experts have made their niche in the market and are being used by companies in their struggle to become and remain compliant. Companies that provide this kind of service normally also offer the ability for a client to be able to fully investigate blockchain transactions as part of their AML responsibilities. As the crypto sector seeks clarity in the regulatory environment in order to become a more accepted part of the financial system, complying with AML requirements will surely be a non-negotiable item on this path. How Does Funds Tracing Work On The Blockchain? Blockchain analytics is a form of data science focused on the analysis, identification, and clustering of data on the blockchain, which is a digitally distributed public ledger. In other words, blockchain analytics is a method that companies use to investigate blockchain transactions and flag potentially fraudulent or illicit activities. Blockchain analytics involves scraping data from crypto transactions, analysing wallets, and clustering wallets with similar typologies. Analytics providers can create a database and group wallets with similar typologies into clusters. This is an integral step when discovering both the source and destination of illicit funds. Law enforcement agencies and businesses utilise blockchain analytics to combat fraud, enhance compliance, and make informed decisions. According to the US-based security website CSO Online a crucial part of the puzzle is identifying various addresses that might be linked to the same wallet, and then finding out who owns it. “Knowing the exact entity behind a batch of addresses can be crucial, and blockchain intelligence companies have ways of finding that. They aggregate information from multiple sources, often using off-chain data to enrich their understanding of transactions. They look at dark web forums, social media posts, and court papers among others.” How to Choose the Right Analytical and Business Protection Tools for Effective AML When it comes to selecting analytical and business protection tools for effective anti-money laundering, 4 key parameters should guide your decision-making process. Firstly, prioritize a comprehensive and extensive database. The effectiveness of your AML or analytical solution relies on accurate risk identification and detection of suspicious activities. Secondly, accessibility is essential, ensuring that businesses of all sizes can easily integrate the solution. The onboarding process should be user-friendly and the pricing structure should be affordable. This allows businesses to leverage AML services without facing significant barriers or excessive costs. Thirdly, consider blockchain support. Your chosen provider should be compatible with a wide range of blockchains, including popular ones, enabling comprehensive monitoring and analysis across multiple networks. Lastly, visualisation and user-friendliness play a vital role in selecting an analytics tool. The system should provide clear and intuitive visualisations of checks and analysis results. This simplifies the interpretation of data and facilitates informed decision-making. Considering these 4 parameters when choosing analytical and business protection tools for effective AML will help businesses combat money laundering and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. A comparison of the top 7 AML tools For crypto projects looking to become properly compliant as regards AML it behoves them to do their research into the leading proponents of blockchain investigation. To this end, the top 7 tools in this industry niche are compared below. Both compliance and analytics tools are considered. Chainalysis (https://www.chainalysis.com) Probably the most prominent transaction monitoring and investigation tool out there is Chainalysis, used by government and private agencies to trace and understand blockchain activity. Chainalysis uses its Reactor investigation software that seeks to connect the transactions with the entity behind them. In its transaction monitoring product called “KYT”, Chainalysis puts its identifications through a rigorous process and offers an API to access this data. Accessibility for Different Businesses Expensive and inaccessible for small companies. Chainalysis is known to be costly, making it unaffordable for small businesses to access their services. The entry barrier for smaller companies is high, limiting their ability to utilize Chainalysis effectively. Database Chainalysis boasts one of the most extensive and top-tier databases among all AML providers. Their database is known for its completeness, enabling thorough analysis and investigation of transactions. Supported Blockchains Wide range, including popular blockchains. Chainalysis offers a broad set of cross-chain visibility, covering a diverse range of blockchains. They support and analyse some of the most popular and widely used blockchains, enhancing their ability to track transactions across different networks. The possible drawback of the Chainalysis offering is the lack of cross-chain visibility and an inability to view all address connections in EVM-compatible networks. Visualisation and User-Friendliness When it comes to visualisation and user-friendliness, Chainalysis falls within the average range. While their tools and interfaces are functional, they do not offer the highest level of user-friendliness compared to some other AML providers in the market. It's important to note that Chainalysis is primarily used for transactional AML/CFT checks (“KYT”) Chainalysis also offers address screening; however it only shows a direct* exposure (meaning that it analyzes only direct transactions of a wallet). *KYT transaction monitoring shows both direct and indirect exposure, while address verification is only for direct exposure. Advanced tracing techniques include automatic peel chain detection and cross-chain graphing, all of which provide a comprehensive solution for de-anonymising wallet addresses. AMLBot (https://amlbot.com) AMLBot’s one-stop solution includes the screening of all a client’s incoming and outgoing transactions, plus wallets screening for AML compliance through integration of its API, with developers on hand to make sure the setup is seamless and conduct blockchain investigations in the case of discovered theft. Add to this the easy signup and user-friendly interface, and you have an AML solution that is accessible for all businesses, including the medium and small enterprises. Accessibility for Different Businesses AMLBot offers accessibility to a wide range of businesses, including both B2B and B2C sectors. It provides an easy entry process and offers favourable conditions for businesses, making it accessible to all types of organisations. Database AMLBot boasts a broad database that integrates top databases from other AML providers, along with its own proprietary database. As a result, it has one of the most comprehensive and deep databases in the market, enabling thorough analysis and investigation. Supported Blockchains The company supports a wide range of popular blockchains and continuously adds new ones. This ensures that it stays up to date with emerging technologies and can effectively track transactions across various blockchain networks. Visualisation and User-Friendliness AMLBot prides itself on being highly user-friendly, providing clear and intuitive data visualisations. Users can easily interpret and analyse the data presented. Additionally, AMLBot has plans to release a new investigation visualisation tool, which will elevate its capabilities to the level of major companies in the industry. Overall, AMLBot offers accessible entry for businesses, a deep and comprehensive database, support for popular blockchains, and user-friendly interfaces with clear data visualisations. Crystal (https://crystalblockchain.com) Crystal offers simple but powerful visualisation tools and intuitive dashboards, helping a business to screen and monitor all transactions for AML compliance. Crystal also boasts that by using its services a crypto business can achieve compliance in only a matter of days. Accessibility for Different Businesses Not available for all types of businesses but more accessible than Chainalysis. Crystal offers limited accessibility when compared to some other AML providers. Database Crystal boasts a broad database that covers a wide range of information. Their database provides comprehensive data to support AML investigations and compliance efforts. Supported Blockchains Crystal supports the most popular blockchains in the industry. This enables users to track transactions and analyze data across multiple blockchain networks. Visualisation and User-Friendliness One of the best visualisations with average user-friendliness. Crystal stands out for its exceptional data visualisations, which are considered among the best in the industry. The platform provides visually appealing representations of data, aiding in the analysis and interpretation of information. However, in terms of user-friendliness, Crystal falls within the average range. The Crystal platform does offer EVM compatibility across multiple networks, although cross-chain visibility is not provided. In addition, real risk scores aren’t always accurately reflected. Overall, Crystal offers a wide-ranging database, supports popular blockchains, and provides exceptional data visualisations. While it may not be as accessible for all types of businesses as some other providers, it offers a valuable toolset for AML investigations and compliance efforts. OKLink (https://www.oklink.com) OKLink says on its website that it is committed to making blockchain data accessible to everyone. It provides data analysis of the major blockchains and its OKLink KYA is a data-driven risk assessment tool that classifies address, and spot transaction risks. Accessibility for Different Businesses OKLink offers accessibility to businesses of all sizes. Whether it is a large corporation, a medium-sized company, or a small business, OKLink provides entry options for a wide range of organisations. Database The company has a relatively shallow database, which affects the accuracy of risk scores. Due to the limited depth of their database, the effectiveness of AML analysis and risk assessment may be compromised. Supported Blockchains OKLink supports a limited number of blockchains. While they may cover some popular blockchains, the range of supported networks is relatively small compared to other AML providers. This could potentially limit the coverage and effectiveness of their services. Visualisation and User-Friendliness OKLink stands out for its excellent data visualisations, which are considered among the best in the industry. Their platform offers visually appealing representations of data, enhancing the user experience and facilitating the interpretation of information. The user-friendliness of OKLink's interface is rated at a high level, making it easy for users to navigate and utilise their tools effectively. In summary, OKLink provides accessibility to businesses of all sizes, but their database is shallow, which can impact the accuracy of risk scores. They support a limited number of blockchains, potentially limiting their coverage. However, OKLink excels in data visualisation, offering excellent visual representations, and maintains a high level of user-friendliness on their platform. Metasleuth (https://metasleuth.io) The Metasleuth investigative tool is still in the Beta stage and accordingly it is free to the user. In fact it does appear to be a very user-driven tool given that user feedback and requests for added features are very much encouraged. In addition Metasleuth allows analysis results to be shared with others for further analysis, thereby encouraging the creation of a collaborative community. Accessibility for Different Businesses Metasleuth provides accessibility to businesses of all sizes and types, particularly it is useful for individuals. Supported Blockchains Metasleuth supports 9 major blockchains, allowing users to track and analyse transactions across multiple networks. The disadvantage of this tool is the impossibility to view all address connections in EVM-compatible networks. Visualisation and User-Friendliness Metasleuth excels in data visualisation, offering one of the best visual representations in the industry. The user-friendliness of Metasleuth's interface is rated at a high level. In summary, Metasleuth is a great B2C investigation tool. While it supports 9 major blockchains with cross-chain analysis capabilities, it lacks cross-chain visibility and the ability to view all address connections in EVM-compatible networks. However, Metasleuth provides excellent data visualisations and a highly user-friendly platform. Misttrack (https://misttrack.io) Misttrack is a tracking and compliance platform for all users. The SlowMist intelligence database is utilised for assigning AML risk scores to addresses based on their interactions on the blockchain. Address labels help a user distinguish between exchanges, crypto whales, MEV bots, and smart contracts. Addresses are profiled so that a user can see the various entities they have interacted with, whether that be exchanges, mixers, DeFi, or NFT platforms, together with any malicious events associated with any of them. Accessibility for Different Businesses Available for all types of businesses. Database Misttrack has a relatively shallow database, which may limit the depth and coverage of their AML analysis. Supported Blockchains Misttrack supports only a small number of blockchains. While they may cover some popular blockchains, the range of supported networks is relatively small compared to other AML providers. Visualisation and User-Friendliness Misttrack's data visualisation capabilities are rated at an average level. The user-friendliness of Misttrack's platform is also considered average, providing a functional but potentially less intuitive interface for users. In general, Misttrack offers accessibility to businesses of all types. However, their database is shallow, which may impact the depth of their analysis. They support a limited number of blockchains, limiting their coverage. The visualisation capabilities and user-friendliness of Misttrack's platform are rated at an average level. Ciphertrace (https://ciphertrace.com/solutions) Among the Ciphertrace solutions is their Sentry anti-money laundering transaction monitor. This is generally an institutional service that can be integrated into existing compliance infrastructure via REST APIs that monitor transactions in real time. Accessibility for Different Businesses Available for all types of businesses. Database Ciphertrace maintains an average level of database depth.

Their proprietary clustering and algorithms rapidly aggregate and correlate various indicators, adding millions of data points weekly. Supported Blockchains Ciphertrace supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and ERC-20 tokens. While they cover several major blockchains, their support may be considered average compared to other AML providers. Visualisation and User-Friendliness Ciphertrace offers an intuitive user interface and powerful graph explorer for visualising the flow of funds over time and through blockchain entities. Their tools provide fast and easy investigation of cryptocurrency transaction IDs and addresses. However, the level of visualisation and user-friendliness is rated at an average level compared to some other AML providers. Ciphertrace Sentry profiles the risk of addresses based on their direct and indirect interactions with a wide variety of entities including exchanges, ATMs, mixers, and gambling services among others. Real time intervention is utilised to prevent withdrawals to high risk or suspicious addresses, and deposits from hacks, scams and ransomware are frozen. In summary, Ciphertrace offers an average level of accessibility for businesses, with a moderate depth of their database and support for multiple major blockchains. Their visualisation and user-friendliness are also rated at an average level. Conclusion Individuals and businesses are very much encouraged to explore and evaluate for themselves the diverse solutions offered by the top AML tools presented here in order to find the most suitable one for their particular crypto AML requirements. Of course, the list mentioned here is not an exhaustive compilation. There are numerous similar tools available in the market. In today’s world of fast-moving and highly intelligent entities in the crypto sector, not all of which are following the regulatory rules, the businesses that desire to make sure that they are fully compliant are the ones that are far more likely to succeed. It’s been a long time in coming, but comprehensive regulations are going to be widely enforced across most global jurisdictions. It is incumbent upon all crypto businesses to ensure that their particular AML solution is sufficiently robust for their needs, as penalties for transgressors are likely to be harsh.

In collaboration with Web3 art collective Iconic Moments, the “Beyond the Edge,” collection features four perspectives from Pollock’s studio floor, where he splattered and dripped paint in his iconic style. The artwork features elements from his paintings including “Number 3,” “Blue Poles” and “Convergence,” which currently reside in museums across the globe.  The collection features 100 digital artworks, which are sold with a corresponding physical print. Additionally, the collection will include a Beyond the Edge series of 100 Ordinals (Bitcoin-based NFTs), Pollock-interpretations from NFT artists and a gamified experience where players can complete a Web3 puzzle and Pollock trivia to win a digital artwork and print.  Helen A. Harrison, director of the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center said in a press release that “Beyond the Edge” helps bring new life to Pollock’s work by giving it a new home on-chain.  “Part of interpretation involves encouraging the use of our artifacts to inspire creativity. It keeps the space alive,” said Harrison. “We want people to understand that art history is not preserved and static; it is preserved and living.”  Additionally, the collection’s focus on Pollock’s studio floor highlights the dynamism of Pollock’s process and brings buyers closer to the artist.  “Typically, what is on the floor of most artist studios does not have a direct relationship to what is on the canvas,” said Harrison. “But the spillover on Pollock’s floor is analogous to the gestures in his canvases. You can relate his process directly to the product.”  As NFTs have begun to find a home in the traditional art world, traditional fine artists have begun to embrace Web3 as a way to grow the reach of their work and connect with their collectors. In July 2021, artist Damien Hirst released “The Currency,” a collection of NFT spot paintings which gave collectors one year to decide whether to burn the digital or physical artworks.

Struct Finance built the new vault on top of GMX's Liquidity Provider Token (GLP) to generate predictable yields for BTC in the form of fixed returns, and USDC in the form of variable returns, while still leveraging a secure asset and minimizing volatility and exposure to other risks. “Our BTC.B-USDC Vaults represent an innovative application of Bitcoin in DeFi. We're taking full advantage of Avalanche's Bridged Bitcoin (BTC.B) to bring about a fresh wave of opportunities in the digital asset space,” said Ersin Dalkali, the Co-founder of Struct Finance. While Bitcoin continues to dominate the market, its inherent lack of a DeFi layer has traditionally made native yield generation quite challenging. Avalanche has unlocked new possibilities for Bitcoin in DeFi with BTC.B (Bridged Bitcoin). Unlike WBTC that relied on centralized bridges, BTC.B is minted via Avalanche Core — a decentralized bridge — and can be trustlessly bridged across networks using the Layer Zero bridge. At present, Bitcoin investments in prominent lending pools yield between 0.2–0.5%. Even the stable swap pools offering wBTC-BTC.B products only manage to deliver returns of about 2%. Struct’s BTC.B-USDC product shatters these limitations, offering significantly higher yields. The purpose of BTC.B is to empower BTC holders to explore DeFi opportunities on the Avalanche blockchain, without the need to acquire secondary tokens or rely on centralized bridges. BTC.B represents BTC coins transferred to the Avalanche blockchain in the form of ERC-20 tokens. With over 6000 BTC bridged and a fully diluted value of $180 million, BTC.B is carving a niche for itself in the crypto arena. The Bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Invesco – three of the world’s leading asset managers – are not just a mere submission. It is a signal that the traditional financial realm is ready to embrace Bitcoin on a new level. Recently, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to a 2X leveraged Bitcoin ETF, sparking an enthusiastic wave of speculation and anticipation for approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Delta hedging Amid the highly volatile crypto industry, Struct Finance’s Interest Rate Products allow anyone to split and repackage the risk of any yield-bearing DeFi assets in different parts to fit their risk profile through an innovative process called “tranching.” Every Interest Rate Product is a single vault split into two portions, or tranches that have different return configurations: A Fixed-return Tranche for conservative investors looking for consistent returns A Variable-return Tranche for investors with a higher risk appetite seeking superior returns The yield from the underlying asset flows into the fixed tranche first to ensure predictable returns. The remainder is then allocated to the variable tranche, which gets enhanced exposure to the underlying yield-bearing asset. Compared to the fixed tranche, the variable tranche might accrue more yield, less yield, or no yield. As part of its BTC.B-USDC Vaults, Struct Finance has implemented a unique approach to managing investment risk: delta hedging. While the fixed tranche takes center stage with its high yield, the variable side of the product offers an additional layer of intriguing complexity and potential. Upon deployment of funds into the vault, the BTC.B in the fixed tranche gets converted into GMX’s GLP token, setting up a position that’s short Bitcoin against GLP and contributing a negative delta. In contrast, the USDC on the variable side is converted into GLP, which inherently carries a positive delta. This innovative delta-hedged product design achieves a fine balance between the positive and negative delta forces. It results in a robust strategy that allows investors to confidently navigate the crypto market’s inherent volatility. This artful interplay of the fixed and variable sides within the vaults opens the doors for investors to tap into the potential of Bitcoin investments like never before. By catering to a diverse range of risk appetites, Struct Finance ensures that both retail and institutional investors can tailor their strategies to maximize their returns, regardless of market conditions. About Struct Finance Struct Finance is at the forefront of the DeFi revolution, with a vision to transform the design and utility of financial products. It empowers users to design their own financial instruments, harnessing the power of tokenized, yield-bearing positions to unlock a world of diverse investment opportunities. Moreover, its cutting-edge financial products adopt a tranche-based system, smartly distributing yield between different investor classes. This balanced approach guarantees a steady yield for risk-averse investors while also offering the prospect of heightened returns to the more adventurous. Initially available on Avalanche, Struct Finance plans to go multichain in the near future.

42393135,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGOrV,1689176067,"What Is Ethereum’s ‘Data Availability' Problem, and Why Does It Matter?","Ethereum is suddenly becoming so crowded with new “layer 2” networks – separate blockchains that sit atop the main network and specialize in fast and cheap transactions – that experts are trying to figure out how to handle the growing number of transactional details.  The whole point of these layer 2 networks in the first place is to reduce congestion. So one way to accomplish that is to reduce the number of times that data needs to be downloaded from the main network.  Enter what’s known as the “data availability problem” – how to prove that the records of the transactional details exist, and are available if needed, without actually downloading them – using cryptography and advanced mathematics.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Top developers of Ethereum have proposed their own plans for handling the data, known as EIP-4844 or colloquially “proto-danksharding.” Such measures are expected to significantly scale the blockchain and introduce “blobs” for data, which helps the blockchain to process that data more efficiently, and on the cheap.  But there’s also a new breed of players – Celestia and Avail are seen as two of the leaders in the space – trying to develop alternate solutions for data availability, arguing that the fullest implementation of Ethereum’s own proposed solution, known as danksharding, might still be years away.  Analogy to Google photo upload  According to Alchemy, a blockchain infrastructure startup, the data availability layer “is a system that stores and provides consensus on the availability of blockchain data.” Its goal is to help reduce the data load from a mainnet blockchain, and therefore lower transaction fees for users of layer 2s, also known as rollups.  Data availability layers, like Celestia and Avail, are betting that they are going to become more integral to layer 2s, as users and developers look for space for their data (on Ethereum).  “Data availability is a solution to the problem of needing to make data available for anyone on the internet to download,” Nick White, the COO of Celestia Labs, said in a tweet.  Understanding data availability – sometimes shorthanded to DA – and how it works can get quite technical, but let's give it a shot:  An analogy that the team at Avail – originally conceived as a special project within the Ethereum scaling solution Polygon, but spun out earlier this year – likes to make is to a user who uploaded a photo to Google, and then wants to make sure the photo is actually there. The user queries Google, which responds with a fragment of the photo; the exercise is the confirmation; the user doesn't need to download the photo, just to make sure it's there.  The idea is that just having a separate blockchain to handle the task of proving that the data exists, and is available if needed, is, in and of itself, a major task that needs to be handled in the interaction between a layer 2 network and the main Ethereum blockchain.  “Celestia and DA layers will be the security and scaling backbone of the entire blockchain ecosystem,” White told CoinDesk. “They will provide the raw input for running all decentralized applications, namely secure, trust-minimized blockspace.”  Proto-danksharding, then danksharding  Ethereum developers have explored other ways in which they can address the issue of data on the blockchain. Concepts like sharding, which splits the blockchain into smaller pieces, allows for more space to process transactions and therefore lower gas fees.  Proto-danksharding, or EIP-4844, is the first prototype for this concept that will go live as early as the end of this year during the Dencun upgrade.  Still, layer 2s need to have that access to data now, and so data availability layers see themselves as a crucial element in helping rollups to succeed.  “The reality is that rollups are now acknowledged to be the best way to do execution,” said Anurag Arjun, the co-founder of Avail, which will provide data availability to layer 2s. “Avail is really a base layer that only focuses on what is important to rollups, which is data availability.”  Some developers behind layer 2s feel that while data availability layers currently play an important role, having data available from a layer 1 is unmatched.  “Your L1 data, fundamentally from just an architectural perspective, is going to be supreme. There's never going to be better data,” Karl Floersch CEO of OP Labs, the main developer of the layer-2 blockchain Optimism, told CoinDesk. “That doesn't mean, though, that all DA providers are not useful. They are useful because they can augment it and there’s a second class of data availability that you can use. They're not a replacement for L1 data, they can just help assist it.”  Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs, the company spearheading the zkSync era rollup, says proto-danksharding is the preferred way of scaling, given that it inherits the underlying security from the Ethereum blockchain.  “The preferred option for our users, if you can afford it, will probably be proto-danksharding,” Gluchowski said. “If at some point we will see the prices rising up again, then there will be a large section of users who will prefer data availability solutions.”  Gluchowski doesn’t think that data availability solutions will disappear once proto-danksharding is live.  “But it doesn't mean that the existing players will remain,” he said.  According to Floersch, “No one data availability provider should take the whole alt-DA marketplace.”  “There should be a lot of different solutions, different trade offs, different teams,” he said.

The crypto lender claims that Stakehound allegedly owes $150 million worth of tokens, including ether (ETH), Polygon’s MATIC, Polkadot’s DOT, and other cryptocurrencies, that belong to Celsius. The complaint was filed as part of Celsius Network’s ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. And according to the filing, StakeHound already initiated arbitration against Celsius. StakeHound argued that it was not obligated to exchange native ETH for “stTokens” after allegedly being confronted with breaching its duties to Celsius. Related Reading: Ethereum Price On The Verge Of Rectangle Pattern Breakout: Is $2000 Within Reach? StakeHound Argues No Obligation to Exchange stTokens, Court Filings State The crypto lender reportedly entrusted StakeHound in 2021 with 25,000 staked native ETH, 35,000 native ETH, 40 million MATIC, and 66,000 DOT, according to court documents. These tokens are valued at approximately $150 million, as indicated in the court filings. Celsius received “stTokens” in exchange for the tokens entrusted to StakeHound, which they could either use for other investments or return to StakeHound in order to retrieve their cryptocurrency. Court documents reveal that StakeHound initiated an arbitration proceeding against Celsius in Switzerland after the crypto lender filed for bankruptcy. In the arbitration filing, StakeHound claimed that it has no obligation to exchange stTokens for other tokens. However, Celsius Network also claims that StakeHound’s arbitration filing violated the automatic stay rule. This rule falls under Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The automatic stay rule under Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code acts as a legal protection and goes into effect when a debtor files for bankruptcy. This provision prohibits most creditors and debt collectors from taking any further action against the debtor or the debtor’s property without first receiving permission from the bankruptcy court. The court filing also shows that Celsius argued that “StakeHound should be obligated to return Celsius’ property immediately.” It also included compensation for damages resulting from StakeHound’s purported breach of contractual duties. Additionally, according to reports in 2022, Celsius Network lost 35,000 ETH when StakeHound lost private keys for a total of approximately 38,000 ETH. Celsius argues that it should not be obligated to repay these assets. At the time, StakeHound attributed the loss to Fireblocks and filed a lawsuit against the custody provider in 2021. However, Celsius Network argued that StakeHound’s relationship with Fireblocks does not absolve it of its obligation to return the tokens owed to the company. Celsius Network Works Towards Restructuring The crypto lender filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 and has been working to restructure its business since then. It has been making efforts to restructure since filing for bankruptcy nearly a year ago. In February 2023, the company presented a restructuring plan which involved creating a public platform owned by Earn creators and sponsored by digital asset firm NovaWulf. The plan also involved converting the crypto lender’s debt into equity and providing a path for creditors to receive payment.

14809306,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542323,1689170415,"Polygon Volume Registers Sharp Increase, What Does It Mean?","On-chain data shows the Polygon trading volume has seen a significant increase compared to the other altcoins. Here’s what this means for MATIC. Polygon Trading Volume Has Observed A Sharp Jump Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, altcoins have observed an increase in trading volume during the last few days. The “trading volume” here is an indicator that measures the daily total amount of a given cryptocurrency that’s getting involved in transactions on the blockchain. When the value of this metric is high, it means that a large number of tokens are being shifted around on the network. Such a trend can be a sign that traders of the asset are actively participating in the market right now. On the other hand, low values imply that the cryptocurrency is observing a low amount of activity currently. This kind of trend can suggest that there isn’t much interest in the coin among general investors at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the trading volume of some of the largest assets in the sector over the past week: Looks like the alts across the board have seen a rise in this metric | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the trading volume of most of the altcoins had declined to relatively low values a few days back, implying that interest in them had dropped. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Rally Is Similar To Genesis Points Of Historical Uptrends: Glassnode However, during the last couple of days or so, the indicator’s value has bounced back for these assets, suggesting that investors are once again participating in trading. From the chart, it’s visible that two altcoins in particular have enjoyed the sharpest increase in the metric: Polygon and BNB. This would mean that these cryptocurrencies have a stronger interest backing them right now. Generally, high amounts of volume are needed to sustain any sharp moves in the price. This is because a high volume implies the presence of a large number of traders, who can provide fuel for building any such move. Thus, whenever the trading volume rises for any asset, the price of the coin becomes more likely to show volatility. Which direction such volatile price action might take the cryptocurrency in is hard to say from the volume alone, however. In the case of Polygon and BNB, though, a surge in their prices occurred in the same period as when their trading volumes jumped. This may imply that this fresh trading interest is leaning toward the buying side, at least for now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Braces For CPI Figures: Will BTC Rally Or Retreat Today? With this latest uptrend, MATIC’s price has gone up by almost 9%. Naturally, if the trading volume continues to remain high in the coming days, it’s possible that this fresh increase might continue into the near future. MATIC Price At the time of writing, Polygon is trading around $0.73, up 5% in the last week.

42393152,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGc11,1689170400,Digital Toy Company Cryptoys Integrating Kid-Friendly AI Chatbot Into NFTs,"OnChain Studios, the Web3 collective behind non-fungible token (NFT) company Cryptoys is planning to integrate a kid-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot into its character-based digital collectibles.  The AI software, called ChatGuardian, features a chat filter that parents can customize to ensure that their kids have safe, appropriate conversations with their NFT characters. Parents will be able to log into Cryptoys’ Guardian Control Center and prohibit specific keywords and topics at their discretion.  Cryptoys hopes that incorporating ChatGuardian will make kids’ experiences with their NFTs engaging and entertaining as they talk with their digital toys. However, the company recognizes the uncertainties and worries that the introduction of AI presents - but don’t fear, there’s no chance of a M3GAN-like doll-gone-wrong here.  Will Weinraub, CEO and co-founder of OnChain Studio and Cryptoys told CoinDesk that kids born in the age of blockchain and AI should be able to interact with their favorite characters from intellectual property (IP) franchises, as opposed to “faceless robotic companions,” such as Google Home.  “You get the same kind of AI functionality that [kids] are so used to, and it's so natural for them these days – but with their favorite characters,” said Weinraub. “That's a big focus with this, and doing it in a safe way, which is why ChatGuardian was built.”  As AI grows to become smarter and more advanced, so will ChatGuardian. Alfonso Martinez, Chief Experience Officer at Cryptoys said in a press release that the company’s priority is to maintain its safety standards and provide the technology to put parents’ minds at ease.  ""We have faith in the future of AI and its amazing abilities to bring to life some of our favorite characters and have our children play with them in a way they’ve never done before – but none of that matters if it’s not on a platform that is as safe as possible,” said Martinez. “And that is what we are working towards achieving.”  ChatGuardian, which OnChain Studios has been developing for the past two years, will first be integrated into Cryptoys’ Zoo-F-O collection, its native series of animal-themed digital collectibles featuring big-eyed kitties, dogs and pandas. While it's first being rolled out to current Cryptoys collectors, it will add additional kid-safe verifications in its second release.  After raising $23 million in funding from crypto investment firm a16z, NFT company Dapper Labs and toy manufacturing giant Mattel in June 2022, Cryptoys has been dedicated to building out its products and partnerships ahead of its dive into AI. In November, it teamed up with Mattel to release a series of digital action figures inspired by the Masters of the Universe film.

14807827,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542377,1689166978,CPI Data For June Is A Bullish Surprise For Bitcoin And Crypto,"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for June, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics today, has sent ripples of optimism throughout the Bitcoin and crypto market. The latest figures reveal a surprising cooling in inflation, which has ignited hopes of a positive outlook. According to the data, the headline CPI year-over-year (YoY) inflation fell to 3.0%, coming in below expectations of 3.1%. This represents a noteworthy decline from the previous month’s 4.0% figure. Even more encouraging is the fact that core CPI YoY inflation dropped to 4.8%, surpassing market expectations of 5.0%. Notably, this is the first time the core CPI has fallen below 5.0% since December 2021, leading analysts at The Kobeissi Letter to remark, “The 26-month battle against inflation may finally be nearing its end.” On a month-on-month (m/m) basis, headline CPI came in at 0.3%, picking up slightly compared to May (+0.1%). Meanwhile, core CPI m/m came in lower than expected, landing at 0.3% instead of 0.4%. BREAKING: US inflation below expectations #Bitcoin Headline CPI YoY 3.0% (forecast 3.1%, last 4.0%) Headline CPI MoM 0.2% (forecast 0.3%, last 0.1%) Core CPI YoY 4.8% (forecast 5.0%, last 5.3%) Core CPI MoM 0.2% (forecast 0.3%, last 0.4%) — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) July 12, 2023 Why The CPI Data Is Crucial For Bitcoin And Crypto The Fed has raised interest rates by 5.0 basis points since March 2022 to bring down the highest inflation in the US in four decades. During the June meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a pause for the first time in this cycle to give itself time to assess the still-evolving impact of the previous hikes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, as always, stressed data dependency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Braces For CPI Figures: Will BTC Rally Or Retreat Today? Prior to the release of the CPI and core CPI, the market was expecting a 92% probability (according to the CME Fed Watch Tool) that Fed policymakers would decide in favor of a 0.25 basis points rate hike at their July 25-26 meeting, which would bring the policy rate into the 5.25% to 5.50% range. Today’s figures are likely to influence the decision by the Fed. However, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly recently said at a Brookings Institution event that the Fed “may end up doing less because we have to do less; we may end up doing just that; we may end up doing more. The data will tell us.” Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Investors Must Monitor The DXY: 6x Rally Ahead? Despite that, 20 minutes after the CPI release, the CME Fed Watch Tool still displayed a 89% of a 25 basis point hike at the end of July. Renowned journalist Walter Bloomberg, citing “The Economists,” stated that the surprisingly good CPI reading is unlikely to deter the Fed from raising interest rates by a quarter point later this month. But, he notes that this rate hike could potentially be the last one in the current cycle. In that vein, it’s important to note that he Fed’s inflation job might not be done yet. Despite headline inflation trending lower and approaching the 2% target fast, sticky inflation is still at levels last seen in 1982, as the following chart shows. The sticky price consumer price index less food and energy is still highly elevated, causing fear of a re-emergence of higher headline inflation. Fed research published two days ago by economist Michael Kiley showed that core CPI data in 2022 and early 2023 were consistent with models showing greater persistence. “Updating forecasts from these models suggests core CPI inflation is likely to remain above 3.5% thru 2024,” writes Kiley. BTC Price Reacts Cautiously At press time, the Bitcoin price quickly jumped above $31,000 before retracing under $30,800. In the coming hours, the market’s true valuation of the data remains to be seen. As analyst Daan explained via Twitter, there is often an initial positive market reaction to positive CPI releases. This rally often lasts between 5 and 15 minutes, after which it begins to roll over. The price then tends to look for liquidity just below the “data release candle”.

The network combines the Cosmos blockchain, and the EVM technology boosting its speed, security, and maximum scalability. It also utilizes the developer support of the Ethereum network. As such, Kava supports cross-chain interoperability, allowing users to transfer assets between Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems. Kava’s native token, KAVA, which powers all the transactions on the blockchain, currently sits at the 62nd position on Coinmarketcap rankings. Related Reading: Coinbase Stock Surges Nearly 10% Despite Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest $12 Million Sale At the time of writing today, July 12, KAVA’s market cap stands at $661,668,155, showing an increase of 5.95%. Also, the coin has recorded more gains in 7 days than other top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, showing losses in their weekly gains. KAVA Posts Positive Price Moves Amid Plummeting Trading Volume KAVA’s price stands at $1.06, depicting a gain of 5.51% in 24 hours, while the weekly price shows an 11.31% increase. But KAVA’s trading volume currently stands at $59,625,037, a decline of 22.88%. This is unexpected, given the increasing price gains. Looking at the declining volume, trading activities with KAVA show low participation. Also, the global market Fear & Greed Index is currently at 57, depicting Neutral. As such, the current gains on KAVA may not be sustainable. Also, KAVA’s daily chart on TradingView, shows that the RSI is at 62 moving towards the overbought region of 70. Such a movement suggests a trend reversal to the downside once the asset reaches the overbought region. So while traders might be encouraged by the greenish moves today, represented by KAVA’s trend above the 50-day moving average, they should be careful, given the possibility of a downtrend soon. Network Upgrade And USDT Launch Might Be Pushing KAVA Many factors affect the prices of crypto assets. Some of these factors include market-wide sentiment, network developments, news, regulations, etc. Regarding KAVA’s price gains today, network developments and events are seemingly responsible for it. The much anticipated Kava 14 blockchain upgrade is slated for today, July 12, at the block height of 5,597,000 at 3:00 p.m. UTC. GitHub reveals that the release will facilitate the seamless unlocking of Cosmos native assets on Kava EVM. Not only that, it will support the conversion of assets between Ethereum and Cosmos through a safer new internal bridge feature. Six days ago, USDT launched on Cosmos through Kava. Even though the launch expanded the Cosmos DeFi Ecosystem, it also brought Kava to the limelight. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Braces For CPI Figures: Will BTC Rally Or Retreat Today?

Through the end of June, the industry’s total losses to illicit actors ranged near $2.5 billion and had fallen 65% relative to mid-2022, whereas legitimate actors were experiencing a “much less severe” drop in inflows during the sluggish bear market, Chainalysis said.  Scammers in particular are pulling in billions of dollars less this year. Chainalysis said two of the biggest operations – VidiLook and Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Financial Management, both of which exit scammed investors to whom they promised lofty returns – disappeared. They haven’t been replaced in spite of bitcoin’s 83% rally year to date, a price surge that usually emboldens opportunistic schemers.  Impersonation scams are, however, bucking the trend: they’re duping nearly 50% more people this year than last. As a result, scammers who pose as authority figures are seeing only a 23% drop-off in overall inflows, whereas all other scams are down 70%.  Unfortunately, it's not all bad news for the bad guys. Chainalysis said ransomware attackers are far outpacing their 2022 haul, with nearly $450 million extorted so far. Attackers are finding success across the board by infecting big and small organizations with targeted ransomware as well as less sophisticated “spray and pray” packages.

Temasek Waiting For Comprehensive Regulatory Framework Temasek CEO Rohit Sipahimalani has stated that the company is not interested in cryptocurrency investments due to the lack of regulatory clarity. This decision comes after the Singaporean state-owned conglomerate experienced a significant loss of $275 million in the aftermath of the FTX crisis. During a recent interview, Sipahimalani highlighted the ""regulatory uncertainty"" surrounding the cryptocurrency sector, making it challenging for Temasek to risk a second investment in this ecosystem. However, he mentioned that the company would reconsider its stance if regulators implemented a comprehensive regulatory framework: He noted, ""If you have the right regulatory framework, and we are comfortable with it, and you have the right investment opportunity, there’s no reason for us not to look at it."" MAS Tightens Regulatory Noose The Monetary Authority of Singapore is working toward establishing a framework of protection for local participants in the crypto industry. It is coming down hard on digital organizations by preventing their lending and staking services that are offered to retail investors. Additionally, the MAS is also leaning toward ruling that these firms should hold customers' assets in a designated trust by the end of 2023. Temasek is a leading investment giant in Singapore and holds around $500 billion of assets. The company had undertaken its first crypto venture by investing a sizeable $275 million with the FTX crypto exchange. Early Stage Investment In FTX CEO Sipahimalani explained that the FTX investment was part of Temasek's strategy to explore new disruptive technologies, “Firstly, you got to remember that the FTX investment was a part of our early-stage investment strategy, where we invest in new disruptive technologies to see what’s around the corner, so that we can bring that to our portfolio companies and benefit within our ecosystem.” The CEO also revealed that the company went ahead with the FTX investment as the exchange “had good technology, was gaining market share, and showed a willingness to engage with regulators and be licensed.” However, despite the investment giant’s due diligence, its FTX bet did not work out. Temasek lost all of its invested $275 million and also took a hit to its reputation in the market. As a result, the team and senior managers responsible for approving the investment have taken full responsibility and faced reductions in their annual compensations. Sipahimalani claimed, “When we do early stage investing, there will be some losses, some write-offs, but, importantly for us, the whole portfolio of early stage investments should do well.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The order book is designed to extend the liquidity of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that feature automated market makers (AMMs), whilst enhancing trading functionality on Sui.  A central limit order book differs from the mechanism used by decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and Sushiswap, which offer straight token swaps.  “DeepBook provides the essential financial foundation for every DeFi tool built on Sui,"" said Greg Siourounis, managing director of the Sui Foundation. ""Combined with the scalability and composability built into the Sui Network, DeepBook offers developers the chance to build applications that are simply not possible on other networks.”  After its mainnet went live in May, Sui, which was founded by former employees of Meta Platforms (META), spiked to $36 million in total locked value (TVL) on the network. The amount has since slumped to $13 million, according to DefiLlama.  From a structural perspective, DeepBook contains a core matching engine and a smart order routing engine that acts in the same way as centralized exchanges.

The Series A round, which closed in February, was led by venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from rapper Snoop Dogg, artist and producer Ryan Tedder, actor Ashton Kutcher-led firm Sound Ventures and more.  Sound’s goal is to disrupt the traditional revenue models of Web2 streaming services such as Spotify or Apple Music. The company’s platform allows artists to mint their songs on-chain as a non-fungible token (NFT) to sell directly to fans and has helped music creators generate $5.5 million on their music sales since its beta launch in 2022. Now, it's opening access to the public to help more artists earn a livable income off of their work.  David Greenstein, co-founder of Sound and former product manager at streaming service Pandora, told CoinDesk that as music subscription services have emerged in the past decade, they’ve expanded access to songs while simultaneously diminishing artists' earnings. On Spotify, for example, artists receive roughly $0.003 per stream.  Inspired by English rock band Radiohead’s “pay what you want” revenue model for the release of their 2007 album In Rainbows, Greenstein wants to empower listeners to fairly compensate artists at their own discretion.  “One of my principles is that talent is equally distributed, and opportunity is not,” said Greenstein. “It shouldn't matter where you come from, what you look like, how much money you have – if you are talented and you make music, you should be able to make a career off of being an artist.”  Greenstein explained that Web3 helps facilitate direct payments for the songs, allowing artists to eliminate the middleman and keep 100% of their revenue. Utilizing Ethereum and layer 2 scaling solution Optimism, artists can upload their songs, mint them on-chain and sell them for ETH – without requiring fans to create a wallet by supporting fiat payments.  “My philosophy has been ‘meet artists with where they're at,’” said Greenstein, discussing onboarding new creators to Web3. “Ultimately, once they get their music collected and get paid out instantly, that's the dopamine effect that goes ‘whoa, I just returned 100% of my revenue, this company didn't take anything from me, and I own the relationship with my artist with with my listeners’ - that is super, super powerful.”  Sound aims to use the funding to expand its artist relations, engineering and marketing teams as it opens its platform to the public. Ahead of its launch last year, Sound raised a $5 million seed round in December 2021, with backers including a16z and rapper 21 Savage.  Many artists and producers seeking to break free from the existing regimes and revenue structures that dictate success in the music industry have turned to Web3 to do so. In February, Web3 music marketplace anotherblock turned Rihanna’s hit song “B**** Better Have My Money” into a fractionalized NFT, allowing holders to earn streaming royalties on the song. In April, credit card provider Mastercard released its Mastercard Music Pass, a free-to-mint NFT that let artists enter its Web3 music accelerator program.

42393151,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGbvt,1689165241,Bitcoin Holds Just Below $31K After U.S. Inflation Improves More Than Forecast,"The U.S. inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) slipped to 3.0% on a year-over-year basis in June from 4.0% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Expectations were for a decline to 3.1%. The price of bitcoin (BTC) – which has been in a holding pattern between $30,000 and $31,000 for much of the past few days – rose modestly to $30,900 in the immediate aftermath of the report, but subsequently gave back that gain, returning to just under $30,800.  The core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, fell to 4.8% from 5.3% previously and against forecasts for 5.0%; the monthly core CPI was 0.2% in June versus 0.4% in May and forecasts for 0.3%.  Today's report shows headline inflation continuing to decline, with June's 3% down from a peak of 9.1% in 2022. Maybe more importantly to the policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the core rate of inflation finally began to budge – to 4.8% from 5.3% – after stubbornly remaining above 5% this year. That 4.8% year-over-year level was the slowest pace since October 2021.  Nevertheless, markets and the Fed (if recent speakers are to be believed) continue to anticipate another rate hike when the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets later this month. The CME's FedWatch tool shows a 91.1% chance of the FOMC boosting rates at its July 25-26 meeting.  Though bitcoin is barely budging on the good inflation news, traditional markets are on the move, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield down 6 basis points to 3.91% and the 2-year yield off 14 basis points to 4.73%.

IRS And Homeland Security Charge Former Engineer New York prosecutors have charged a former senior security engineer at an international technology company, Shakeeb Ahmed, in the first-ever criminal case involving an attack on an unnamed decentralized exchange. The indictment alleges that Ahmed exploited a vulnerability in the exchange's smart contract, resulting in approximately $9 million worth of inflated fees. He then laundered the stolen funds through complex transactions on the blockchain. IRS Agent Tyler Hatcher said, “As alleged, Mr. Ahmed used his skills as a computer security engineer to steal millions of dollars. He then allegedly tried to hide the stolen funds, but his skills were no match for IRS Criminal Investigation's Cyber Crimes Unit. We, along with our partners at HSI and the Department of Justice, are at the forefront of cyber investigations and will track these fraudsters anywhere they try to hide and hold them accountable.” Manipulated Pricing Data To Inflate Fees The attack targeted a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange operating on the Solana blockchain. The exchange allowed users to exchange various cryptocurrencies and pay fees to those who provided liquidity. Ahmed’s attack involved inserting fake pricing data into the smart contract, causing it to generate inflated fees in the range of $9 million. After generating the fees, he engaged in token-swap transactions and bridged the fraud proceeds from the Solana blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain. He also converted the proceeds into Monero, an anonymous cryptocurrency that is hard to trace. Ahmed further attempted to cover his tracks by using overseas cryptocurrency exchanges. Tracked Down Through Online Activities Following the attack, Ahmed approached the exchange, offering to return the stolen funds for a bounty fee of $1.5 million on the condition that the crypto exchange promised not to approach law enforcement. However, his actions did not go unnoticed by authorities. Investigators tracked his online activities, which included searches for information on the attack, criminal liability, and potential escape from the United States to evade charges. Homeland Security Special Agent in Charge Chad Plantz said, “Financial crime strikes at the core of our national and economic banking security. With an attack of this magnitude, it’s crucial we ensure continued consumer confidence in our financial system…It’s cases like these that demonstrate HSI’s commitment and ability to work with a coalition of the willing to dismantle these complicated and technical fraud schemes and identify those responsible regardless of where they operate.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42393164,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGd0Z,1689164977,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Continues in Holding Pattern Ahead of June U.S. Inflation Data,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) is trading slightly higher on Wednesday ahead of the U.S. inflation report for June, up just shy of 1% at about $30,700. According to SEBA Bank, $29,500 and $31,500 are key levels to watch on the downside and upside for the cryptocurrency, and the team takes note of bitcoin’s twenty-day moving average as close to the psychologically significant $30,000 mark. “We may see a breakout of these key levels post today’s data,” said the bank in a morning note. Economists forcasts the headline year-on-year CPI is likely to have cooled to 3.1% in June from May's 4.0%, with the core figure slowing to 5% from 5.3%. Altcoins also saw some gains early Wednesday, with AAVE adding just under 7% over the past 24 hours and bitcoin cash (BCH) up 4.5%.  Shares of Coinbase (COIN) jumped as much as 16% Tuesday after disclosure of a deal with Cboe’s BZX Exchange to maintain a surveillance-sharing agreement for five of its spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. The shares ultimately closed higher by just shy of 10%. The agreement was made on June 21 for each of these applications, amendments to original filings filed showed. The surveillance-sharing agreement, also referred to as SSA, has become an integral part of all ETF applications filed recently as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stated for years that these arrangements are necessary to prevent market manipulation.  Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest sold $12 million worth of Coinbase’s shares on Tuesday as the stock surged higher following the above-mentioned surveillance-sharing agreement. The sales, however, were only a small fraction of the nearly 11 million shares owned across all of ARK’s funds, with COIN being a 6.2% holding for the fund management company. The estimated cost average for COIN across the various funds are, $239.60 for the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), $254.65 for Ark’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), and $242 for ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), according to market data. Though COIN is now ahead 165% for 2023, yesterday’s closing price of $89.15 remains far below those levels.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the headline U.S. consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate has cooled over the past 12 months.  The decline is consistent with the forward-looking ZEW inflation expectations indicator, now pointing to deflation in the coming months.  For markets, the big question is whether the Federal Reserve will abandon its hawkish stance in response to dwindling inflation indicators.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Bitcoin Liquidations Drop to Lowest Since April, Indicating Waning Interest Among Futures Traders  A Second Round of the Lummis-Gillibrand Crypto Bill Elevates CFTC, Defines DeFi  MicroStrategy Only Needs to Liquidate Bitcoin in Extreme Price Corrections: Bernstein",NEUTRAL,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/12/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-continues-in-holding-pattern-ahead-of-june-us-inflation-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e96674d694b666c7ed203764bf00f112940caff-1128x588.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393149,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGbgV,1689164636,Coinbase Key Metrics Show Bullish Outlook Among Traders With Short-Term Caution,"Coinbase (COIN) rose almost 10% Tuesday after the crypto exchange was listed as a “surveillance partner” for several spot bitcoin ETFs, and rising options trading volumes and open interest indicate bullish sentiment may stay with the stock in the coming months.  The firm was already named as a partner for BlackRock’s proposed bitcoin ETF – underpinning a price surge in the past month. The agreement, absent from previous public spot bitcoin ETF filings, compels a crypto exchange to share trading data with authorities.  Some market observers said Coinbase stock may rise further in the medium term due to its ties with influential traditional finance players, but expressed caution over short-term moves.  “Coinbase is winning investor interest due to its history with spot Bitcoin ETFs,” FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in a note to CoinDesk. “This is an expected development, but there were still risks, so a sigh of relief quickly turned into a short squeeze.""  Referring to a $12 million COIN sale by Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest on Tuesday, Kuptsikevich said: ""We can't rule out the impact of reports from the Ark Innovation fund, which announced the sale of Coinbase shares ... The range exit offers further momentum with potential targets for a quick rally to $113 and longer-term upside targets near $160, as Coinbase has missed out on a significant portion of the cryptocurrency market's upside.”  Key Metrics  Data shows open interest, or the number of unsettled futures contracts, grew 4% on Tuesday as the stock ended the day at $89.15. This brings the year-to-date gains to 74%, major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  Rising open interest is a sign of increased bets on any asset, such as tokens or stocks, as it suggests an inflow of new money into a financial market – usually meaning a current trend is expected to continue.  COIN-listed options saw open interest climb 14.6% to 953,393 contracts on Tuesday, data shows, a level much higher than the 52-week average of 812,568 contracts. In addition, the put-call ratio decreased by 6.1% to 1.2 in the last five days, suggesting a bullish outlook for COIN among traders.

Following a somewhat positive run at the beginning of July, it seems the bears are back in control, with APT’s value dipping by nearly 10% in the last seven days. This has pretty much been the case for the APT token since the end of January as its price has declined steadily since reaching its all-time high of $18.58 on January 26. APT Falls By 14% In One Week – Price Overview The Aptos token made a bright start to July, gaining more than 13% in a few days. However, the prominent altcoin has shed all its recent gains, now trading below the month’s opening price of $7.29. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Downtrend Set To Persist – What To Expect After reaching a high of $8.24 on July 4, the Aptos token experienced a significant decline, bringing its value to $7.15 two days later. Since then, it appears that the coin’s price has been moving mostly sideways. But it is worth noting that APT fell below the $7 price level for the first time this month on July 8. The token dropped below this level again on July 10 before climbing back to $7.18 the following day. As of this writing, APT is valued at $7.03, with a mere 0.3% gain in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the coin has a market capitalization of over $1.48 billion, making it the 36th-biggest cryptocurrency. The Aptos token has a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $48.9 million, representing a 14.6% decline in the past day. Is The Downward Trend Over? A look at the daily chart shows that the APT token faces significant resistance at the $8 price zone. The token’s price has failed to break through this level twice in the past three weeks, falling back to $7 at each instance. That said, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the selling pressure is high at the moment, having crossed below the 50 mark. This means there may not be sufficient buying pressure to push the token’s price above the $8 resistance. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Miners’ Reduced Selling Meanwhile, price action data reveals that APT has been stuck in a downtrend channel since the high of $16.22 made on February 16, 2023. Over the past five months, Aptos has failed to record a higher high, while writing three lower lows. If Aptos continues in its descending trend channel, we might see its price fall below $4. On the flip side, if it manages to break out of the downtrend channel and through the $8 resistance, then cryptocurrency might reach a price of $10.

42393147,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGbbN,1689163033,Aptos' APT Token Steady After $32M Token Unlock,"Prices of Aptos' native token APT were steady on Wednesday at around $7 despite a significant number of tokens being unlocked.  Early Wednesday, 4.54 million APT tokens, worth nearly $32 million, were unlocked, according to data from TokenUnlocks. Tokens worth $22.5 million were distributed to the community members, with Aptos foundations receiving $9.4 million in tokens.  Cryptocurrencies are generally locked up to prevent the big bag holders – usually early investors or even the project's team members – from selling their coins all at once and causing price dumps. Token unlocks are considered bearish, as they free up liquidity and open doors for potential profit-taking by those who receive coins as a part of the unlock.  Although, the latest APT unlock amounted to just 2.2% of the token's total supply of 210.41 million, the dollar value of the unlock was nearly 38% of APT's average 30-day trading volume and had the potential to push prices lower, according to market analyst Ton Dunleavy.  Still, APT is trading flat, at around $7, extending its recent trading range of $6.8 to $7.3. Perhaps, Aptos' proposed plan to enhance the blockchain's capabilities to handle tokenized securities like tokenized real estate and in-game currencies has helped the cryptocurrency stay resilient.  Besides, APT's continued sideways trend is consistent with the market leader, bitcoin's (BTC) rangebound trading, ahead of the crucial U.S. inflation report.

IRS And Homeland Security Charge Former Engineer New York prosecutors have charged a former senior security engineer at an international technology company, Shakeeb Ahmed, in the first-ever criminal case involving an attack on an unnamed decentralized exchange. The indictment alleges that Ahmed exploited a vulnerability in the exchange's smart contract, resulting in approximately $9 million worth of inflated fees. He then laundered the stolen funds through complex transactions on the blockchain. IRS Agent Tyler Hatcher said, “As alleged, Mr. Ahmed used his skills as a computer security engineer to steal millions of dollars. He then allegedly tried to hide the stolen funds, but his skills were no match for IRS Criminal Investigation's Cyber Crimes Unit. We, along with our partners at HSI and the Department of Justice, are at the forefront of cyber investigations and will track these fraudsters anywhere they try to hide and hold them accountable.” Manipulated Pricing Data To Inflate Fees The attack targeted a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange operating on the Solana blockchain. The exchange allowed users to exchange various cryptocurrencies and pay fees to those who provided liquidity. Ahmed’s attack involved inserting fake pricing data into the smart contract, causing it to generate inflated fees in the range of $9 million. After generating the fees, he engaged in token-swap transactions and bridged the fraud proceeds from the Solana blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain. He also converted the proceeds into Monero, an anonymous cryptocurrency that is hard to trace. Ahmed further attempted to cover his tracks by using overseas cryptocurrency exchanges. Tracked Down Through Online Activities Following the attack, Ahmed approached the exchange, offering to return the stolen funds for a bounty fee of $1.5 million on the condition that the crypto exchange promised not to approach law enforcement. However, his actions did not go unnoticed by authorities. Investigators tracked his online activities, which included searches for information on the attack, criminal liability, and potential escape from the United States to evade charges. Homeland Security Special Agent in Charge Chad Plantz said, “Financial crime strikes at the core of our national and economic banking security. With an attack of this magnitude, it’s crucial we ensure continued consumer confidence in our financial system…It’s cases like these that demonstrate HSI’s commitment and ability to work with a coalition of the willing to dismantle these complicated and technical fraud schemes and identify those responsible regardless of where they operate.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14804739,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542332,1689159655,"Shiba Inu Ecosystem Token BONE Surges 88%, Too Late To Buy?","The Shiba Inu ecosystem token Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) has seen a staggering 88% price increase within the last 28 days, since Jun 15. Last Saturday, the price rally stopped for the time being at just under $1.50, which means that the Shiba Inu-based token has already experienced an interim price increase of over 120%. Since then, the BONE price has been in a consolidation. A look at the 1-day chart of BONE shows that the price initially shot above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, but failed to defend the gains on a daily basis and eventually fell below the resistance. Thus, the $1.38 level is the key resistance. The current correction has caused the overheated daily RSI to reset from 81 to 61. Still, further consolidation might be needed to ignite further upside potential. A target for bears could be the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA)and the 38.2% Fibonacci level in the $1.00 to $1.01 range. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Breakout Alert: Potential 30% Rally Looming After a potentially necessary reset of technical indicators and another breakout above $1.38, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.50 and the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.80 would then be the next targets before the all-time high of late February 2023 at $2.10 would be within reach. Shiba Inu: Reasons For The BONE Price Rally The main reason for the current rally in the price of Shibaswap Bone (BONE) can be seen in the announcement by Shiba Inu chief developer Shytoshi Kusama about the launch of Shibarium next month. BONE will be the governance token of the upcoming highly anticipated layer 2 network and will also serve as a gas token. As NewsBTC reported, Kusama published a new blog post last week stating that Shibarium will “likely” be unveiled at the Blockchain Futurist Conference. The conference will be held on August 15 and 16 in Toronto, Canada. Related Reading: Breaking: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Reveals Shibarium Release Date, SHIB Up 3% BONE will then not only be the official governance token for Shibarium, but will also be used for any payment of transaction fees (gas fees) on Shibarium. Thus, BONE will get a great utility that did not exist before. Undoubtedly, this will increase the demand for BONE. Traders might currently try to front-run the news. In classic crypto fashion, the event could become a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event. Investors should therefore be cautious. Worth noting: While BONE is rallying strongly, Shiba Inu has fallen -1.5% in the last seven days. The popular dog-themed cryptocurrency managed to break out of a multi-month downtrend channel, but currently lacks momentum to confirm the breakout. While BONE is benefiting from the Shibarium news, SHIB investors seem to remain skeptical and suffer from the launch delays. The network was originally scheduled for a 2022 release.

42393144,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGbR7,1689159600,"A Second Round of the Lummis-Gillibrand Crypto Bill Elevates CFTC, Defines DeFi","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would take a back seat in a crypto oversight bill re-launched by Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), which would require that crypto exchanges be overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and all stablecoin issuers be regulated depository institutions.  The crypto industry needs the U.S. Senate if it’s going to get U.S. regulation, and this bill represents the widest-reaching effort to yet emerge from that body. Last year’s inaugural bill from the bipartisan duo failed to make significant progress, and the wishes of key figures such as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, remain murky this year.  The bill’s big-ticket item is the border it draws between securities oversight and everything else – the long-awaited division that would give the SEC and CFTC their crypto marching orders. Broadly, it says that assets that don’t give the investor a financial interest in a business shouldn’t be considered securities, even if they “benefit from entrepreneurial and managerial efforts that determine the value of the assets.” Those issuing cryptocurrencies would make twice-yearly disclosures to the SEC, but as long as their tokens don’t represent debt or equity or tick other ownership boxes, they’d stay outside SEC reach – unless the agency wins a court challenge also outlined in the bill.  Most of the progress so far in this legislative session has been in the House, where Republicans have been keen on a pair of bills – one to address rules of the road for stablecoins and another to define how crypto markets would be regulated. Before those recent efforts, though, Lummis and Gillibrand had carried the legislative hopes of much of the crypto industry when they’d introduced the first version of their bill in 2022, some of which found echoes in later legislation. Now the sector gets Lummis-Gillibrand 2.0, which broadly pushes in the same direction as the House proposals while taking some of its own detours.  CFTC oversight  As it stands, the bill would put most crypto tokens within the CFTC’s commodities space and would grant that agency power over crypto trading. Still, the same amount of funding would be directed to both agencies – $500 million – and they’d both have an equal hand in a new self-regulatory organization (SRO) for crypto.  Setting up such a go-between entity, like the National Futures Association or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in the securities sector, remains controversial. Basically, Lummis and Gillibrand are suggesting a separate organization to govern industry standards and impose penalties for violations. In this case, it’s described as the “consumer protection and market integrity authority.”  The legislation would also demand customers’ assets are fully segregated and impose new risk-management standards for crypto lending, outright banning “rehypothecation,” in which crypto firms use customer’s assets to stretch their own credit. Several crypto platforms declared bankruptcy over the past year, revealing that they had loaned out or otherwise used customer funds and could no longer honor withdrawal requests.  Regulated stablecoins  And stablecoins – typically dollar-based tokens like Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC – could only be issued by banks or credit unions regulated by the federal government or the states, but it would let existing issuers jump in line first to get newly established licensing for that role. It would set up a new kind of charter through the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, for instance, to be a stablecoin issuer.  Lummis and Gillibrand are additionally pushing a definition for decentralized finance (DeFi) that sets strict rules for when a software project strays into a more centralized business effort and then needs to be registered as an exchange. Previous proposals for regulation hadn’t managed to rope in DeFi.  About a month ago, the senators met with Lael Brainard, director of the White House’s National Economic Council and a former Federal Reserve governor who oversaw its research into central bank digital currency (CBDC), going over the details of the legislation for about an hour, said people familiar with the effort behind the new bill. The lawmakers’ staffs have also had regular contact with the relevant financial agencies, the people said. They said this bill was designed to find a middle road between the parties, and many of its provisions were drawn directly from proposals from other lawmakers, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a dedicated crypto critic.  SEC acts  While the industry waits for this and other bills to make real progress, such as approval by one of the involved committees in the House or Senate, the SEC under Chair Gary Gensler has moved aggressively to pin prominent crypto companies to existing securities laws. The agency’s most recent enforcement campaign targeted both Binance and Coinbase with accusations that the businesses are operating illegally.  While Lummis and Gillibrand, together, occupy seats in the Senate committees that will be evaluating their bill, they haven’t yet signed other senators onto the effort. The Senate’s 50-50 party divide will require legislation that can draw a wide range of bipartisan support. The lessons of recent history suggest that committee chairs need to get directly involved in financial legislation for it to become law – such as the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 or the 2018 banking overhaul pushed by Sen. Mike Crapo, then chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.  This effort could potentially get chopped into smaller pieces or absorbed into other bills, though every month that speeds the U.S. closer to the next presidential election puts increased political weight on major moves from an already sluggish U.S. Congress. While crypto has been a priority for both parties this year – judging from the number of hearings in both the House and Senate – it’s unclear when a crypto bill might be put to floor votes and sent to the president’s desk.  ""While the Lummis-Gillibrand proposal is a major step forward from the Senate, we will also be watching the House for any movement on stablecoin and market structure bills,” said Georgia Quinn, general counsel of Anchorage Digital, which occupies an unusual role as the sole digital asset bank with an OCC charter.  Another potential hotbed of debate in Lummis-Gillibrand is the $1.4 billion in funding it offers over five years. It raises that money by holding crypto to the same wash-sales tax restrictions that are held over securities, meaning a taxpayer can’t benefit from crypto losses if they happened from a sale that’s quickly followed by the repurchase of the same assets. The bill would also require crypto intermediaries to account for their assets by annually assessing the actual market value of their holdings and paying taxes on gains – a “mark to market” approach.  But it also includes some significant tax benefits for crypto investors, including that they don’t have to be taxed on crypto they get from mining, staking, forks or airdrops until they pocket the new assets.

Quantum Leap was deployed on its Goerli testnet last week, followed by a community vote in which 97.91% of voters agreeed to push forward to mainnet.  According to the StarkWare team, the company behind the Starknet blockchain, TPS peaked several times at 90 during testing, though was consistently at 37 TPS. StarkWare previously had told CoinDesk that TPS following Quantum Leap would reach into the triple digits.  Starkware CEO Uri Kolodny acknowledged the undershoot in a press release sent to CoinDesk: “We said this upgrade would deliver potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, and only hoped from the stress test to check we’re on target. A few dozen TPS at this early point would have left us excited – but we got more than we bargained for.”  In addition, the time-to-inclusion, which is the time needed to confirm and report a transaction, was at about 10 seconds, higher than anticipated.  “The numbers speak for themselves. They’re an invitation for every dev, wherever they are, to put the network to the test,” Kolodny said.  According to the project’s roadmap, Starknet has other upgrades planned for later in the year, which aims to make the blockchain more scalable by reducing transaction fees and shortening block intervals.

The bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation sets governance and reserve requirements for cryptocurrencies tied to the value of other assets with related provisions set to take effect six months ahead of other rules on licensing for crypto wallet providers and exchanges.  The EBA wants to “encourage timely preparatory actions” ahead of that start date, to protect consumers and reduce the cliff-edge for companies on June 30, the regulator said.  Issuers of e-money tokens tied to fiat currency and of asset-reference tokens linked to other products such as gold should start adhering to MiCA’s “high standards” of disclosure to potential users sooner rather than later, non-binding guidelines published by the Paris-based agency said, offering a template form for companies to voluntarily notify intentions to national regulators.  The news comes on the same day that ESMA, the EBA’s counterpart for securities markets, issued its first batch of draft MiCA regulations detailing what crypto providers seeking a license to operate across the bloc will need to give to the authorities.

Vanguards bitcoin mining investments The company has been snapping up shares of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, two major players in the Bitcoin mining space. Vanguard now holds 17.5 million shares of Marathon Digital, a 60% increase from its previous position. Given Marathon's current share price of $16.03, this puts the value of Vanguard's investment at a cool $280.5 million. But Vanguard didn't stop there. It also boosted its holdings in Riot Blockchain, a Colorado-based Bitcoin miner. Vanguard now owns 17.9 million shares of Riot, an 18% increase from its previous stake. This additional investment is worth over $281 million, pushing Vanguard's total investment in Bitcoin mining firms to a whopping $560 million. An institutional change of heart This is all quite surprising given Vanguard's stance just two years ago. Back then, the company had been very sceptical about the long-term investment potential of cryptocurrencies. However, much water has since flowed under the bridge and now Vanguard has become the largest shareholder of Marathon Digital. Not just Vanguard, but the broader financial industry, seems to be warming up to cryptocurrencies. Last week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described Bitcoin as an ""international asset”, and “digitised gold"". BlackRock, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, recently applied to the SEC for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. It's also the second-largest investor in Marathon Digital. Bitcoin mining big business Bitcoin mining, once a niche activity, has evolved into a big business. Today's miners are large operations that use server farms and consume a lot of energy. In return for their efforts in verifying blockchain transactions, they're rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins. It's a high-stakes game, and it seems Vanguard is betting big on its players.

Powered by Open AI’s GPT-4, Prompt-to-SQL allows developers to generate queries using natural language prompts. It’s the latest example of blockchain companies utilizing artificial intelligence, two technologies whose synergies are strong. The ultimate goal of Space and Time is to make blockchain and off-chain data available to developers on demand, regardless of which network they’re working on. Its Proof of SQL technology enables data to be delivered with cryptographic proof that queries are accurate and tamperproof. Prompt-to-SQL slots into this, making it easier for researchers, analysts, and developers to query data with no coding required. Decentralized Data on Demand With Microsoft funding to its name, Space and Time comes with a certain pedigree. Its technology, which makes use of zero-knowledge proofs, is already being provisioned to dapp developers building across multiple chains. The release of Prompt-to-SQL is a major milestone for SxT, not only in enhancing its core product, but in terms of the new user groups it supports. As SxT CTO Scott Dykstra explains, “AI-powered SQL is a game-changer for businesses that run a lean analytics team. Leveraging OpenAI decreases time-to-value for building data pipelines, analytics dashboards or simply writing SQL.” The Space and Time co-founder highlights the benefit of being able to generate SQL or Python scripts using prompts and to ask natural-language questions about data. Made for Enterprise Initial applications for SxT’s tech have primarily been for crypto-native developers creating consumer dapps. The real value of its Proof of SQL system, however, lies in its ability to open blockchain up to enterprises. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language designed for managing data in relational database systems. By making it available within an onchain environment, Space and Time has made blockchain more palatable to enterprises, who can create apps that pull in data from a broad range of sources, not just onchain feeds. Houston is the name of the chatbot Space and Time has created for fielding data queries. Any time a user enters a prompt, the chatbot will process it and deliver an SQL query. The resultant output can be published to APIs, dashboards and AI/ML models in a single click. According to ChainML CEO Ron Bodkin, whose company developed Houston, the bot provides “industry-leading AI functionality to users, including technical documentation support, code generation, self-service analytics, research, and seamless navigation powered by a conversational interface.” Smart developers have long been aware of GPT-4’s ability to help with their homework, providing capable code that can save time and brain power. The ability to plug artificial intelligence into SxT’s Proof of SQL service, however, supports far more sophisticated use cases. By doing little more than entering text prompts, developers can access on- and off-chain data quickly and in a variety of convenient format AI chatbots are commonly envisaged in the context of providing customer support and helping consumers with low-level tasks such as holiday bookings. With Prompt-to-SQL, Space and Time has shown it’s equally adept at helping tech-savvy users perform more complex tasks. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management Sells Significant Stake In Coinbase Cathie Wood’s investment in Coinbase solidified Ark Investment Management as one of the major stakeholders, ranking fourth in terms of Coinbase shares held. However, the recent sale by Ark Investment Management suggests a shift in strategy as the firm decided to put a pause on its buying spree. Related Reading: SEC Sues Binance, Coinbase Then BlackRock Files For Bitcoin Spot ETF; Is This An Inside Job? Notably, Cathie Wood’s Coinbase stock buying frenzy came at a time when the crypto market was in a period of uncertainty, specifically during the regulatory scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fallout from the FTX exchange, and an increase in bankruptcy cases which cast a shadow over investor sentiment. Though there are no specific reasons why Cathie Wood has decided to sell a large portion of its Coinbase shares, this move can be attributed to being a reflection of a calculated response to the current market conditions. Over the past month, the US regulator has intensified its scrutiny of the industry and this intensification has impacted even larger players in the industry such as Binance and Coinbase. Both exchanges saw the US SEC file a lawsuit against them over the alleged offering of unregulated securities. COIN Buck The Trend Despite the large sale of Coinbase’s shares by Ark Investment Management, the market reacted unexpectedly as the stock price defied expectations and surged by nearly 10% in just one day. Particularly, over the past 24 hours, Coinbase shares saw an increase of 9.78%, reflecting a positive investor sentiment. The stock has seen an increase from the $46 level which it traded at early in June, to trading at a price of $91.54, at the time of writing. The performance of Coinbase’s stock is noteworthy, considering the context of the crypto market. Since the beginning of the year, Coinbase’s stock has been on an upward trajectory, with its stock surging more than 150%. This increase has outpaced the overall cryptocurrency market, which has gained around 50% in the same period.

The UK’s financial regulator, the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), shut down 26 of the 34 crypto ATMs it inspected since the start of the year. Following a coordinated investigation with several other law enforcement agencies using powers under the country’s money laundering regulations, the agency successfully “disrupted” 26 ATM sites it visited and inspected since the start of 2023. FCA: Comply with Regulations or Shut Down At the beginning of the year, the FCA warned all illegal ATM operators to comply with its regulations or dismantle their operations. After issuing the injunction, the regulator inspected 36 crypto ATM sites in Exeter, Nottingham, and Sheffield, which it found operating without FCA registration. #Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal. The action we’ve taken over the past few months and wider work shows that we will act to stop illegal activity. #cryptocurrency https://t.co/KnMhiKAt21 — Financial Conduct Authority (@TheFCA) May 5, 2023 Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, spoke out against the operation of all cryptocurrency ATMs and warned users of the dangers of using unregistered ATMs. He said: If you use a crypto ATM in the UK, you are using a machine that is operating illegally, and you may be handing your money over to criminals. Smart further said users of illegal ATMs “will not be protected” by the UK government or ATM operators. He concluded by saying: We will continue to warn the public and take appropriate enforcement action against unregistered crypto ATM operators. UK Takes a Tough Stance on Crypto ATMs Cryptocurrency ATMs gained popularity over recent years and allow users to sell crypto such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in exchange for cash. The FCA believes illegal crypto ATMs pose a high risk and may be used to facilitate illegal activities such as money laundering. As such, the FCA said it was working with the National Economic Crime Centre in March to develop and coordinate a plan to act against ATMs operating illegally. Mark Stewart, the Executive Director of Enforcement and Market oversight at the FCA, said at the time: Crypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal and, as today shows, we will take action to stop this. This operation, alongside last month’s action in Leeds, sends a clear message that we will continue to identify and disrupt unregistered crypto businesses in the UK. Crypto products are not currently regulated, and they are high-risk. You should be prepared to lose all your money if you invest in them. The regulator issued several warnings to unregistered ATM providers and ordered them to cease operations immediately, adding failure to comply would result in legal proceedings against them.

Given the concerns around stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are better ""stable solutions"" for every country, Sankar said.  The number two at the Indian central bank said that stablecoins are beneficial to economies such as the U.S. and Europe, to whose currencies the stablecoins may be linked. But in a country like India, they could potentially replace the use of the rupee in the local economy, Sankar said, thanks also in part to the transfer of profits made by the government by issuing currency to private players.  ""If large stablecoins are linked to some other currency, there is a risk of dollarization,"" Sankar reportedly said, expressing concerns about the potential impact of stablecoins on India’s capital regulations or monetary policy. ""We have to be very careful about allowing these sorts of instruments... From the past experience in other countries, it is an existential threat to policy sovereignty.""  CoinDesk previously reported that emerging economies represented in the Group of 20 (G20) forum have major concerns around stablecoins. Global stablecoin regulation has become a sticking point between the Group of Seven, representing advanced economies and the G20, representing emerging and advanced economies.  Sankar's comments confirm concerns within the G20, of which India currently holds the presidency. The G7 has said its nations will align with the Financial Stability Board's (FSB) recommendations for stablecoins, expected this month, which are focused on the impact of stablecoin use on wider financial stability. Meanwhile, the G20 is looking to align with a more nuanced synthesis paper jointly produced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the FSB expected later in the year.

The startup describes itself as a “wealth tech company” and is led by its founder and CEO Steve Rosenblum, aimed at investors who want to protect their portfolios from the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Libertify protects investors by simplifying and automating the trading experience. Users simply connect their exchange account or decentralized crypto wallet to Libertify’s app to take advantage of its “crypto seatbelt”. It allows them to benefit from a unique risk management tool that works by automatically diversifying their portfolio among volatile and stable assets, based on the user’s level of risk tolerance. With Libertify, crypto investors can assess and adjust how much of each of their assets should be exposed to market risk, while leaving the remainder in a stablecoin asset to protect against price declines. Libertify adjusts the exposure of the user’s portfolio according to their risk profile, dynamically allocating assets based on the daily market risk. The app does this in a clever way, exchanging user’s assets for an equivalent token. In the case of Bitcoin, instead of holding BTC the user will hold L-Bitcoin. In a blog post on Medium, Rosenblum explains how this works, saying these assets take into consideration how the market is changing each day and how much risk the investor is willing to take. “This makes the market more stable by 25%, meaning investors are less likely to give up, which makes them more aware of their finances and helps them reach their goal of financial freedom,” Rosenblum said. Investors can take advantage of the market whenever conditions become more favorable. Libertify’s AI-powered alerts will notify users whenever it identifies an opportunity to make a profitable trade, or determines that action should be taken to protect against risk. For each alert, Libertify will also recommend the optimum sizing of each trade. The promise of Libertify’s app has already helped it to raise €3.5 million in financing, and now the company is hoping to gain further traction with its participation in the 2023 Hong Kong Fintech Fast Track. The event, organized by Invest Hong Kong, a government department that promotes the territory as a leading business location, is now in its fourth year. It provides startups with the opportunity to scale their business and fast-track their success with access to prospective clients and strategic investors. Libertify was named as the winner of the Paris leg of the Hong Kong Fintech Fast Track semi-final stage, and will be joined in the grand finale in November by 11 other startups. At the final event, startups will be able to meet with representatives of more than 80 “corporate and investor champions” and explore business opportunities with them. The corporate and investor champions come from some of Hong Kong’s most established and prestigious financial firms, including AMTD, AIA, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Standard Chartered, as well as technology providers such as Tencent. Libertify’s risk management app is already available for many of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, and will soon expand beyond crypto to traditional financial markets.

The proposals set out in the EU securities agency's 160-page consultation include how crypto firms should handle user complaints and manage conflicts of interest.  MiCA, which takes effect in 2024, gives wallet providers and exchanges, known as crypto asset service providers or CASPs, the ability to operate across the 27-nation bloc with one license and sets reserve requirements for stablecoins tied to the value of other assets. Though the law was largely agreed by June 2022, ESMA has clearly been influenced by subsequent allegations of poor governance and security in the crypto sector, such as those that followed the FTX exchange filing for bankruptcy in November.  “Some of the recent collapses in the crypto world have shown a misuse of clients’ funds and crypto-assets,” said the consultation, which also cites “media reports about hack attacks at CASPs, which have often resulted in the theft of significant amounts of client crypto-assets.”  The agency is also seeking confidential information about crypto companies’ expected revenue, number of white papers and the use of on- and off-chain trading in a consultation that lasts until Sept. 20.  ESMA said a further tranche of consultations will follow in October, covering sustainability and record-keeping, with a final batch due early 2024 that will consider when crypto counts as a security and how foreign companies will be able to serve EU clients.  Applicants must show that clients’ funds and crypto are segregated and not used for the company’s own account, as well as detailing the security of their ICT system and underlying distributed ledger technology, the document said.  Companies will also have to identify and manage potentially conflicting interests with or among clients if, say, they execute orders for clients while also operating a trading platform, or if a staffer has access to confidential information about the issuer of a crypto asset they hold.  The consultation comes on the same day that the EBA, ESMA's counterpart for banks, urged stablecoin issuers to anticipate MiCA rules to avoid a cliff-edge in June 2024, when new rules targeting cryptocurrencies tied to fiat take effect.

Just under $9 million worth of bitcoin futures were liquidated, Coinglass data shows. Bitcoin made up for a large share of the total $28 million of crypto-tracked liquidations on Tuesday – among the lowest levels so far this year.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position or fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Futures trading volumes slumped 21% compared to Monday. Open interest, or the number of unsettled contracts, rose 1.16%, meaning traded opened more positions but ultimately used significantly lesser leverage – suggesting lesser risk-on sentiment.  Meanwhile, FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email that bitcoin could see sideways action in the coming months and, hence, lower futures trading volumes than usual, citing data.  “Bitcoin was up 0.6% in the past 24 hours and is approaching the upper boundary of its short-term range at $31.4K,” Kuptsikevich said. “Only a break above this level will indicate that the market is ready for further gains, with potential targets near $35.5K by the end of the month.”  “The market is experiencing a period of ""reaccumulation"", which often occurs when halving is imminent, Glassnode notes.

14801851,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/consensys-announces-launch-of-linea-zkevm-on-ethereum,1689152400,ConsenSys Announces Launch Of Linea zkEVM On Ethereum,"ConsenSys has announced the launch of its layer-2 network Linea, as the Ethereum ecosystem welcomed yet another scaling solution. Linea incorporates zero-knowledge cryptography and has produced considerable scaling milestones during testing, achieving faster throughput and significantly lower transaction costs compared to the main Ethereum network. A New Scaling Solution Linea is ConsenSys’s new layer-2 scaling solution that enables developers to build or migrate decentralized applications (dApps) for Ethereum. The layer-2 network utilizes zero-knowledge proofs and is EVM-compliant, meaning applications on the network can seamlessly interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Zero-knowledge (zk) cryptography helps facilitate greater scalability and improved transaction speeds, thus helping address network congestion and high gas fees on Ethereum. The rollup network implemented by Linea is commonly known as zkEVM, thanks to its compliance with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). A Highly Successful Testing Phase The Linea zkEVM has been launched after a lengthy and highly successful testing phase after it was revealed that the ConsenSys team had been working on the rollup for the past four years. The testing phase began when ConsenSys released a public testnet on the 28th of March, enabling the stress-testing of the new layer-2 technology. The testnet phase saw around 5.5 million unique wallets conduct 46 million transactions. ConsenSys noted several improvements when it came to Linea’s performance, transaction costs, and user experience throughout its testing phase. ConsenSys has claimed that the fees on the network will be 15 times lower than those prevailing on the Ethereum main network. The alpha phase began on the 11th of July, with over 100 partners involved. Joseph Lubin, the founder and CEO of ConsenSys, talked about the number of layer-2 Ethereum scaling solutions and protocols and highlighted their importance when it came to driving the development of Web3 functionality and applications. “With the Merge to Proof of Stake and the broad traction of the rollup-centric roadmap, Ethereum L2s are set to play a crucial role in making great advances in scalability and usability.” The announcement also highlights several decentralized finance (DeFi) applications migrating to Linea to take advantage of its fast finality, security from the Ethereum mainnet, and capital-efficient bridge. The network also offers users low gas fees, high throughput, and low latency, all of which are critical to power blockchain gaming, non-fungible tokens, and social applications. App developers can deploy their projects and applications on Linea’s “Alpha” network as early as Friday. However, general users will have to wait until next week to access the network. The launch of the Alpha mainnet will use several safeguards to protect decentralized applications, users, and the network itself. Measures include allowing only launch partners to execute calls over the network for the first week. ConsenSys plans to further open up the network during ETHCC, which is scheduled to take place in France from the 17th of July. It also plans to hold a bug bounty and monitor performance before opening up the network to end users. ConsenSys also announced the launch of its Linea Ecosystem Investment Alliance (EIA). The alliance will see over 30 venture capitalist firms give advisory assistance and lend capital to ecosystem builders. Ethereum layer-2 solutions have become a major talking point in 2023, with Polygon also taking its zkEVM network public in March. Starknet has also highlighted plans to increase the throughput on its network this year. Starknet founder Eli Ben-Sasson is the pioneer behind zk-proofs. Key Features Linea has seen the introduction of several features and upgrades with its alpha mainnet phase. These include a dynamic fee mechanism and a new outer-proof system. The alpha mainnet phase also introduces a feature called “batch conflation.” This feature optimizes the number of layer-2 transactions and blocks that can fit into a layer-1 batch. This allows it to reduce fixed costs typically associated with layer-1 and help provide a cost-effective transaction experience. These upgrades will help Linea offer transaction costs that are far lower than Ethereum’s main layer. Additionally, MetaMask will also offer support for Linea soon, allowing users to access the network through the MetaMask Portfolio and Bridge, Swap, and Buy features. The MetaMask integration can be expected in the next few weeks and allow wallet users to interact with decentralized applications and protocols based on Linea.

42393145,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGbWF,1689152322,MicroStrategy Only Needs to Liquidate Bitcoin in Extreme Price Corrections: Bernstein,"MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) plan to raise long term debt puts it under pressure to liquidate its bitcoin (BTC) holdings, but only in case of extreme price corrections, especially around its debt expiry which is due in mid-2025, broker Bernstein said in a report Tuesday.  Higher bitcoin prices means MicroStrategy has a stronger balance sheet, a higher share price and easier debt repayment without the need to sell down its cryptocurrency holdings, the report said. Furthermore, strong bitcoin prices and a higher stock price, allows the company to raise new debt or equity and to redeem existing convertible notes, the broker said.  Conversely, if bitcoin crashes and reaches “absolute depressed prices” and the value of MicroStrategy’s cryptocurrency holdings do not cover debt and certain covenants post June 2025, the “corporate structure would come under pressure from ‘spring forward’ clauses - 2028 due debt does have liquidity covenants which could spring forward the debt to 2025/26”, the report added.  “Given bitcoin’s volatility, using debt as a strategy is always precarious, and one-off forced liquidations can never be ruled out completely,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  MicroStrategy holds around 152,000 bitcoin, with a total cost basis of about $4.5 billion, and an average price of roughly $29,600, the note said. The market value of MicroStrategy’s cryptocurrency assets form about 0.78% of the total bitcoin in supply and account for around 20% of daily average BTC trading volume, the analysts wrote.  The market value of bitcoin assets form 95% of the market capitalization of MicroStrategy and net of debt raised to buy BTC, equate to about 49% of the market cap of the company, the report added.  MicroStrategy’s ability to refinance its debt maturities would be greatly enhanced if its share price, and the value of its bitcoin holdings, were to increase meaningfully, investment bank Berenberg said in a report on Monday.

However, the portal stayed live for around an hour before going offline for unknown reasons, leaving users in the lurch. Claims Portal Goes Live According to users on social media, the FTX claims portal went live on the 11th of July, with the page stating that users have until the 29th of September to submit their respective claims. “Except as otherwise provided herein, all persons and entities, (including, without limitation, individuals, partnerships, corporations, joint ventures, and trusts) that assert a Customer Claim against any of the Debtors which arose on or prior to the Petition Date must file a proof of such claim so that it is actually received by Kroll Restructuring Administration LLC, the Debtors’ noticing and claims agent (the “Claims Agent”), on or before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the 29th of September, 2023 (the “Customer Bar Date”).” The claims portal allowed customers of the bankrupt exchange to access their account information, following which they could file a petition which would be included in FTX’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The claims portal is for those customers who had accounts with FTX.com, FTX.us, Blockfolio, FTX EU, FTX JP, and cryptocurrency exchange Liquid. According to instructions available on the claims portal when it was online, customers would be redirected to the Kroll Restructuring Administration platform, where they would have to confirm their balances and submit an electronic proof of claim. “You will be directed to the Kroll Restructuring Administration platform to confirm your balances as of the Petition Date and, if necessary, submit an electronic proof of claim.” And Then Goes Offline However, barely an hour after it went online, the claims portal went offline for unknown reasons, leaving users dumbfounded. Before it went offline, the claims portal stated that users would be able to access their account balances as they were on the 11th of November, which was the day the FTX exchange filed for bankruptcy. However, users still have the option of filing their proof-of-claim through US mail and Kroll’s online customer form. At the time of writing this report, the claims portal is still offline. The debtors’ party to the FTX bankruptcy case had announced in June that they were planning to launch a claims portal to handle customer claims and stated they would announce when the portal goes live. “The FTX Debtors’ “Customer Bar Date” has been set for the 29th of September, 2023, at 4 p.m. ET. To streamline the process for customers, the FTX Debtors are finalizing an online claims portal at https://claims.ftx.com. FTX Debtors will announce when the portal is active.” The FTX Collapse FTX was one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges and suffered a spectacular collapse in November 2022, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The exchange suffered a crippling liquidity crisis at the time, as fearful customers pulled an estimated $6 billion from the exchange amidst concerns that their assets were at risk. The news that the FTX exchange and its sister concern Alameda Research had been sharing their assets in a bid to boost their balance sheets only served to hasten the collapse. The bankruptcy proceedings are currently ongoing in a Delaware court. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial for allegations of fraud is set to begin in October, with the former CEO set to be tried on 8 criminal charges for now. FTX is estimated to owe its creditors over $3 billion, with prosecutors alleging that Bankman-Fried co-mingled customer assets and misled investors about FTX’s risk management strategies and practices.

14799846,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542302,1689147630,Bitcoin Market Braces For CPI Figures: Will BTC Rally Or Retreat Today?,"As the highly anticipated US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for June is set to be released today at 8:30 am EST, the Bitcoin (BTC) market finds itself at a crucial crossroads. With inflation concerns lingering and the Federal Reserve’s next moves under scrutiny, market participants eagerly await the impact of the CPI figures on BTC’s price trajectory. The expectations are as follows: Headline y/y at 3.1% (last 4.0%) Headline m/m at 0.3% (last 0.1%) Core CPI y/y of 5.0% (last 5.3%) Core CPI m/m of 0.3% (last 0.4%) The Fed’s Battle Against Inflation In recent months, inflationary pressures have been a cause for concern, capturing the attention of investors and economists alike. While headline inflation is cooling off fast and expected to fall further to 3.1% (from 4.0% in May), it is the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, that has become increasingly important. In recent public appearances, members of the Federal Reserve (Fed) have maintained a hawkish stance and expressed concerns about a potential resurgence of inflation regarding the elevated core inflation. The underlying concern stems from the fact that inflation has primarily declined due to resolving supply chain problems, while core inflation remains elevated. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Investors Must Monitor The DXY: 6x Rally Ahead? The rise in wages could contribute to a cycle of increasing sticky core inflation. Although core CPI was at 5.3% in May, experts now anticipate a gradual decline to 5.0% in June. While this is progress, it shows how sticky core inflation currently remains. An unexpectedly sharp drop would therefore be extremely bullish. Any number below expectation could lead to a rally in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, as Christopher Inks, renowned trader and psychology coach, tweeted: CPI will be released with a large expected drop from 4% last time to 3.1% expected this time around for the headline number. If core CPI comes in below 5%, that would be huge, and you better hold onto your britches. Will used car sales send core down much greater than expected? A surprise in core inflation could have a significant impact on the next rate hike decision by the Fed. The next FOMC meeting is on July 26. At the moment, the CME FedWatch tool predicts with 92.4% a 25 bps rate hike which is holding back the markets. This probability is likely to drop massively if the core CPI surprises to the downside. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Mid-Cycle Point: Historical Pattern Repeating Itself? As usual, JP Morgan has drawn up a game plan for the S&P 500 in view of today’s release of the Consumer Price Index. According to the banking giant, a drop in the CPI to 3%-3.2% has the highest probability at 45%. The S&P 500 could then gain between 0.5-0.75%. The second-highest probability is given by JP Morgan to a drop in the headline CPI to 2.8% to 2.9% (25%). In this case, the S&P 500 could rise by 1.5-1.75%. Moreover, the banking giant gives a 10% chance to a fall of the CPI to 2.7% or lower, while a surpassing of the forecasted reading (above 3.3%) is just at 20%. Potential Scenarios For Bitcoin If the CPI figures come in higher than expected, signaling elevated inflationary pressures, BTC could face a temporary retreat. In the case of CPI falling within the predicted range, BTC’s response may be moderate. Investors will closely monitor the data for signs of sustained inflation, potentially resulting in a slight dip in Bitcoin’s price. A lower-than-anticipated CPI figure, suggesting easing inflationary pressures, could ignite a bullish rally in BTC. Investors may perceive this as a positive signal which is signaling a continued rate pause by the Fed. A lower-than-expected core CPI reading has the potential to provide a much-needed boost for Bitcoin. At press time, the Bitcoin price has managed to break above the mid-range resistance, trading at $30,767.

Previously, companies and their auditors held different opinions on the timing and criteria for determining whether the sale of virtual assets to customers constituted profit. Under these rules, if companies sell virtual assets, the sales will be recognized as profit after the company fulfills obligations to its holders.  Costs incurred in developing virtual assets and their platforms will not be recognized as intangible assets, the announcement said.

42393182,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgGpAX,1689145282,Crypto Traders Prepare for Bitcoin Volatility as Focus Shifts to U.S. CPI,"A technical analysis indicator called Bollinger Bands, signaling a volatility explosion in bitcoin (BTC), has grabbed the attention of crypto traders and analysts ahead of the U.S. inflation report for June.  ""Bollinger bands are tight. How tight? Squeezes of this caliber have only ever occurred a handful of times in the past decade. Most squeezes like this have tipped the market bias before the breakout,"" analyst Josh Olszewicz tweeted early Wednesday, adding that a similar tightening of bands was last seen in early January, just before bitcoin's bull revival.  The so-called squeeze or tightening of bitcoin's Bollinger bands has also caught the eye of John Bollinger, the inventor of the indicator.  Bollinger bands are derived by placing volatility lines two standard deviations above and below the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of the asset price. The bands are driven by the degree of price turbulence, with the squeeze or tightening of the bands representing volatility contraction and the widening of bands representing volatility explosion.  When bands tighten sharply, traders prepare for a big move and usually trade in the direction in which prices breach the band. The logic is that the market builds energy during consolidation, which is eventually unleashed in either direction.  The most common method of tracking the bandwidth is to divide the spread between the upper and lower bands with the 20-day SMA of prices.  Bitcoin's Bollinger bandwidth has declined to 0.04, the lowest since early January, according to the charting platform TradingView.  As per pseudonymous analyst Nunya Bizniz the bandwidth has been this low only a handful of times in bitcoin's 14-year history, and we might see a volatility explosion soon.  Tighter bands do not always imply immediate and notable volatility explosion/directional clarity in the market.  That said, the U.S. CPI data, scheduled for release on Wednesday at 12:30 UTC, will likely influence the Federal Reserve interest rate expectations and inject volatility into markets.  Per economists polled by Wall Street Journal, the headline year-on-year CPI is likely to have cooled to 3.1% in June from May's 4.0%, with the core figure slowing to 5% from 5.3%.  A reading of 3.1% would bring the headline closer to the Fed's target of 2%, weakening the case of continued interest rate hikes or monetary tightening that was partly responsible for last year's crypto crash. In other words, bitcoin may break out of the Bollinger band squeeze if the inflation data matches estimates.  Note that expectations for a big drop in CPI have been amped up by a report released Tuesday that showed used car prices, one of the key components of the U.S. CPI, tanked by 10.3% over the past year, recording the 10th straight monthly decline in June.  So, risk assets, including bitcoin, may see downside volatility if the headline CPI and the core figure come in hotter-than-expected.

Resistance lines are an essential concept in technical analysis that represent price levels where selling pressure historically outweighed buying pressure, resulting in a temporary halt or reversal in an asset’s price movement. In the case of SOL, the breakthrough of both long-term and short-term resistance lines signifies a significant shift in the market dynamics. Breakout Signals A Shift In SOL Price Movement Analyzing the weekly time frame reveals an important development for Solana. Last week, SOL managed to break out from a long-term descending resistance line. Remarkably, this resistance line had been in place for a staggering 600 days, originating from the all-time high reached back in November 2021. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Downtrend Set To Persist – What To Expect Breakouts from such extended structures often serve as a significant indication that the preceding trend has concluded and a new one has commenced, but in the opposite direction. SOL market cap nearing the $9 billion mark. Chart: TradingView.com Considering SOL’s recent breakout from the long-term descending resistance line, it is highly likely that the cryptocurrency has initiated a new bullish trend reversal. Related Reading: Cardano Price Momentum Bid Fizzles Out Despite New Payment Feature This breakthrough represents a major shift in the market dynamics for SOL, suggesting that the selling pressure that previously impeded its progress has weakened or been overcome by increasing buying pressure. As a result, the stage is set for SOL to potentially experience an upward surge in value and embark on a new bullish trajectory. Source: Benzinga Meanwhile, over the previous week, Solana has experienced a notable 98.0% surge in trading volume, accompanied by a 0.91% rise in the coin’s circulating supply. Current SOL Price And Recent Performance At present, the SOL price listed on CoinGecko stands at $22.07, highlighting a notable 1.7% rally within the past 24 hours. Over the course of the last seven days, SOL has exhibited an impressive climb of 14.7%. These recent price movements further support the notion of a potential bullish trend reversal, as SOL continues to gather positive momentum. Source: Coingecko While the current analysis suggests a bullish outlook for Solana, it is essential to acknowledge the possibility of a price correction. If SOL loses its current momentum, there is a chance that it could retrace to the descending resistance line. However, it is worth noting that there are no immediate indications or signals in the short term to suggest such a decline is likely to occur.

According to court filings, Celsius entrusted StakeHound with 25,000 staked native ETH, 35,000 native ETH, 40 million MATIC, and 66,000 DOT in 2021. Celsius exchanged the tokens, which were valued at over $150 million, for StakeHound's liquid staking ""stTokens,"" according to the filings.  A court docket filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York alleges that StakeHound filed an arbitration agreement against Celsius in Switzerland after the lender's bankruptcy.  In the Switzerland filing, StakeHound argued that it has “no obligation” to exchange the stTokens for other tokens. StakeHound also says it lost the keys associated with 35,000 Celsius ETH, and is relieved of its obligation to return these tokens.  Celsius says the filing of the arbitration is in violation of Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Section 362 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, also known as the ""automatic stay,"" is a rule that stops most creditors from trying to collect debts or take legal action against a person or company as soon as they file for bankruptcy.  StakeHound blamed Fireblocks for the loss, and launched a suit against the custody provider in 2021.

14792830,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542261,1689130836,Unmoved Bitcoin Supply Hits New all time high as BTC rally resumes,"Bitcoin continues to dominate the market as it struggles to find a continued surge in price. In its latest weekly report, crypto exchange Bitfinex highlighted a key part of Ark Invest’s report to show growing support from strong holders and improved institutional sentiment toward Bitcoin. As of early July, 70% of the existing Bitcoin supply of 19.4 million BTC has remained unmoved for at least 12 months. This means that Bitcoin’s unmoved supply, that is, the amount of BTC that hasn’t been transferred in over a year, just reached an all-time high. Bitcoin Sees Growing Institutional Interest Institutional investors are taking interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. When major players put serious money into an asset, it signals they believe in its future value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Rate Retakes All-Time High As Miners Continue To Expand Capacity According to the report, several factors have contributed to the increase in long-term confidence of Bitcoin investors. One major influence is the news of major investment companies filing for Bitcoin spot ETFs which seemed to have fueled more interest. Over-the-counter (OTC) trading reached a one-year high in June, surging by 60% in the past quarter alone. These OTC trading deals are now more popular with institutional investors, indicating BTC is becoming a preferred investment option. BTC price recovers above $30,500 resistance | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com This surge in Bitcoin’s unmoved supply definitely means positive things for the price of Bitcoin. As more of the supply becomes locked up by long-term holders, the available supply in circulation decreases. According to the law of supply and demand, when supply goes down but demand remains the same or increases, the price goes up. It’s not all bullish for the asset though because, according to Bitfinex’s report, news of the spot ETF filing by BlackRock and other investment companies led to a surge of more than 38% in Bitcoin Open Interest. This suggests that derivatives traders may be dominating the current market momentum, which might negatively affect the price of BTC in the short term. Percent of Supply Last Active 5+ Years Ago Reaches All-Time High Following in the same vein as the Bitfinex report, on-chain data from Glassnode alerts also show that Bitcoin’s supply which has remained unmoved for more than 5 years recently reached an all-time high of 29.070%. Clearly, this shows that more people are holding Bitcoin as a long-term investment rather than trading or spending it.

Oulahyane, currently in custody in Morocco for foreign charges, allegedly has stolen approximately $450,000 worth of cryptocurrency and NFTs. OpenSea NFT Theft According to the indictment filed by the US Department of Justice, Soufiane Oulahyane, the alleged hacker who stole $450,000 worth of cryptocurrency NFTs from a victim in Manhattan, sold several NFTs that belonged to the victim. The NFTs sold by Oulahyane included pieces from popular series like “Bored Ape Yacht Club,” “Meebit,” “Bored Ape Kennel Club,” and “CryptoDad.” Per the press release, Oulahyane allegedly used a scheme to “spoof” the login page to the OpenSea marketplace by creating a fake website that looked like the real one. He used paid advertisements on a popular search engine to direct users to his fake website, where he tricked them into entering their login credentials or other private information. Related Reading: BNB Whale Moves $35 Million To Binance Ahead Of Arkham (ARKM) Sale The information was automatically sent to an email account controlled by Oulahyane, who used it to gain unauthorized access to the victims’ cryptocurrency wallets. Oulahyane is charged with wire fraud, use of an unauthorized access device, affecting transactions with an access device to receive something of value equal to or greater than $1,000, and aggravated identity theft. If convicted, Oulahyane could face up to 20 years in prison for wire fraud, 10 years for using an unauthorized access device, 15 years for affecting transactions with an access device, and a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years for aggravated identity theft. Moreover, according to the press release, the DOJ emphasizes that digital assets, such as cryptocurrency and NFTs, are not immune from cyber fraudsters. The charges against Oulahyane serve as a reminder that cybercrime techniques such as “spoofing” are still in use and can be adapted for use in the cryptocurrency space. The DOJ is committed to prosecuting these fraudsters in the US and abroad.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s indecisiveness has resulted in slower movement for altcoins. Related Reading: ConsenSys To Launch Linea, Its ZK-Rollup Network, On Main Ethereum Network Despite this, Ethereum has risen on its chart, although the technical outlook suggests low demand and accumulation due to reduced buying strength. Despite the fall in buying strength, buyers still hold an advantage over sellers in the market. However, if Ethereum fails to move above its immediate resistance, the coin may retrace on its chart, potentially falling below its local support level and activating bearish sentiment. Investors are now looking ahead to the release of US CPI data, which analysts predict will significantly impact the market in the coming weeks. The market capitalization of Ethereum has fallen slightly, indicating slow demand for the altcoin. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,870. The daily chart indicated a potential breakout as the price approached the upper boundary of a rectangle pattern. The crucial overhead resistance for Ethereum was identified at $1,880. If the price managed to surpass this level, it could potentially exceed $1,900 and ultimately reach the milestone of $2,000. However, it was essential for ETH to surpass the $1,880 mark in the upcoming trading sessions. On the downside, there was a local support level of $1,820. A dip below this point could lead to a decline towards $1,770. Technical Analysis The inability to break through the $1,900 level had a detrimental impact on investor confidence, resulting in ongoing challenges for Ethereum regarding demand on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained positive, although it suggested a relatively low level of demand. Furthermore, Ethereum’s current position below the 20-Simple Moving Average line indicated a decline in buying strength, indicating that buyers were gradually losing control of the price momentum. In addition to the low buying strength, ETH also experienced a decline on capital inflows. This indicated a decline in investor interest, as evidenced by the Chaikin Money Flow indicator. Conversely, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed declining red histograms, suggesting a potential breakout in the upcoming trading sessions. The MACD is a useful tool for identifying price momentum and trend changes.

As Asia opens for its trading day, bitcoin continues to maintain the $30,000 mark, while ether is flat. Coinglass data shows that in the last 12 hours, slightly more long liquidations than short liquidations occurred with $7 million longs and $6.73 million shorts liquidated.  “The market is on standby, awaiting signals of price increase following a slowdown or pause in rate hikes in the second half of the year, which would be characterized by liquidity inflow,” Bybit’s Ether Chen, its lead financial engineer, told CoinDesk in a note.  Chen said that Bybit’s team expects a potential market price recovery in the fourth quarter, but a full bull market might not materialize until 2024. This recovery would be contingent upon the cessation of rate hikes, BTC halving and the resolution of regulatory storms.  Tim Frost, CEO of digital wealth platform Yield App points to slowing inflation figures but a market confidence that the Federal Reserve will still hike rates as sort of a mixed messaging, and dismisses a recent report from Standard Chartered that bitcoin will hit $120,000 by the end of next year.  “For crypto assets, this all likely means continued range trading around current levels. Bitcoin seems to be holding fairly close to $30,000 at the moment which is a near 100% increase from January when it started the year at $16,540,” he said in a note. “There are few assets that perform this well in a ""bear"" market, and canny seasoned traders will likely have done well on BTC this year.”  Regardless of whether or not Standard Chartered’s price prediction is correct, Frost sees a bull market on the horizon for 2024.  “The long-range consensus remains that crypto will enter its next bull market in 2024 following a period of continued consolidation this year and, behind closed doors, huge innovation is paving the way for the next wave of crypto adoption,” he concludes.

But a yuan stablecoin isn’t going to happen, just like a Chinese CBDC isn’t going to challenge the dollar.  Why? Because the free convertibility of the yuan goes against a core fundamental of Beijing’s monetary policy.  The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) maintains strict control over the exchange rate of the yuan, keeping it within a narrow band and not allowing it to float freely in international markets. This allows China to maintain control over its export prices and its domestic economy. But it also means that the yuan can’t be used offshore, like the Euro or the USD, and there are strict capital controls on how much you can bring out of the country.  The more you want your currency used internationally, the more control you need to be willing to cede.  As the IMF’s First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath pointed out in a 2022 address, these aren’t the traits of a global currency. After all, the yuan is only used in around 3.2% of global payments as of January 2022.  ""If a country is aspiring to be a global currency, then in that case, you would need to have, you know, basically fully and freely mobile capital, full capital account liberalization, full convertibility of exchange rate, which is not the case right now in China,"" Gopinath is quoted as saying.  Currency manipulation has been a contentious issue in U.S.-China relations, and, in 2019, the U.S. Department of the Treasury labeled the country a currency manipulator.  But you know who else has been on the radar of Washington as a currency manipulator? Taiwan.  Unlike China, Taiwan does not actively intervene to keep its currency, the New Taiwan Dollar (TWD), artificially low to boost exports. Instead, Taiwan has been known to intervene to prevent rapid appreciation of its currency which could harm its export-driven economy.  This has been an issue since 1989, when the U.S. Senate subcommittee on international trade called a hearing on currency manipulation.  David Mulford, the then Under Secretary-Designate, Office of International Affairs, Department of the Treasury, noted the large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market by Taiwan's Central Bank, and a lack of significant exchange rate appreciation despite Taiwan running large external surpluses.  For its part, Taipei denies that it's an active currency manipulator or has capital controls pointing to the openness of foreign investment in its equities market and the free convertibility of foreign currency on its shores.  But if there’s one thing that unites Taipei and Beijing, its that central bankers in neither capital want to relinquish control of their currencies to the market.

14788200,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542243,1689120028,Insider Job? Chainalysis Report Suggests Multichain Attacker Had Inside Connections,"On July 6, 2023, the Multichain Protocol was hit by a massive hack, resulting in the loss of over $125 million worth of cryptocurrency. The attack targeted the protocol’s Fantom bridge, resulting in the theft of valuable crypto assets like WBTC, USDC, DAI, wETH, and Link. The stolen funds amounted to a staggering $126 million, with WBTC accounting for $30.9 million, wETH for $13.6 million, and USDC for $57 million. This exploit is one of the biggest crypto hacks on record. Multichain Attack And Insider Threats According to a recent report by the analysis and data company Chainalysis, the attack is suspected to be an inside job since Multichain has recently experienced some notable issues unrelated to its protocol design, prompting public suspicions that insiders may have carried out this recent exploit. The disappearance of Multichain’s CEO, who is known by the alias Zhaojun, and the subsequent suspension of services for more than 10 chains, including DynoChain, Redlight Chain, and Public Mint has added fuel to this suspicion. Related Reading: ConsenSys To Launch Linea, Its ZK-Rollup Network, On Main Ethereum Network Multichain’s smart contracts are secured by a multi-party computation (MPC) system, which functions similarly to a multi-signature wallet system. However, like multi-signature wallets, these systems are still vulnerable if an attacker possesses sufficient MPC keys. It is possible that the attacker gained control of Multichain’s MPC keys to pull off this exploit. Interestingly, the attacker did not swap out centrally controlled assets like USDC, which can be frozen by the issuing company (Circle, in the case of USDC), along with the addresses holding those assets. Most hackers typically seek to quickly swap funds for those not vulnerable to those security measures. In total, addresses frozen by Circle and Tether hold approximately $65 million in assets stolen from Multichain. What’s Next For The Protocol? After the attack, the Multichain team tweeted that they were beginning an investigation and urged users to pause transactions. A day later, on July 7, the team tweeted that the protocol would be stopping service indefinitely. Unfortunately, scammers also went on Twitter to spread a “phishing” link and impersonate the Fantom Foundation to trick affected users into claiming an “emergency FTM distribution.” Cross-chain bridge protocols have proven lucrative targets for hackers due to their experimental designs and the fact that they generally have large, centralized repositories of assets bridged by users to other blockchains. However, there may be several methods to mitigate risk and prevent similar exploits from occurring. According to Chainalysis, one way is through rigorous code audits to help developers standardize projects and investors evaluate protocol viability. While the Multichain hack appears to have resulted from compromised keys rather than faulty code, reputable audit reports often explicitly identify which parts of protocols are vulnerable to private key theft, which may help users better assess risk. Additionally, users of any protocol can research before they transact. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Investors Must Monitor The DXY: 6x Rally Ahead? The exploit suffered has left the blockchain community on edge, with many waiting for an official statement from the Multichain team. The team has not made any public pronouncements on the matter, leaving users and investors in the dark about the protocol’s future. Multichain’s native token, MULTI, has experienced a significant decline over the past 7 days, with a drop of over 27% in this timeframe. Currently, the token is trading at $2.387, representing a further decline of 3% in the last 24 hours.
