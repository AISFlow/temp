42390736,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8UFF,1721172981,Trump Says He’ll Release Fourth NFT Collection: 'The People Want Me to Do Another One',"Former president Donald Trump planning to release a fourth NFT collection, according to a Bloomberg interview.  Trump has pivoted to embracing the crypto industry, saying ""if we don’t do it, China is going to pick it up.""  Donald Trump plans to release a fourth NFT collection, according to a wide-ranging interview with the former president published in Bloomberg Businessweek on Tuesday.  In the interview, Trump said his previous collections were “very successful” and sold out in a day: “The whole thing sold out: 45,000 of the cards. And I did it three times [and] I’m going to do another one, because the people want me to do another one. It’s unbelievable spirit. Beautiful.”  Trump previously teased the idea of releasing a fourth NFT collection at a gala for his mugshot NFT holders at Mar-a-Lago in May, but was non-committal at the time, saying “I believe in supply and demand. And as you know, one did great, two did great, three did great. At some point maybe that turns around.”  But as the crypto industry continues to rally behind Trump’s reelection campaign, the former president seems to be growing more comfortable embracing NFTs and crypto. In May, Trump’s campaign began accepting crypto donations. A Tuesday report from the Wall Street Journal citing new data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) found that, of the roughly $331 million raised by Trump’s election campaign last quarter, about $3 million was in crypto.  Yesterday, Trump announced pro-Bitcoin senator J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) as his choice for running mate.  Major players in the crypto industry, including Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell and Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have donated hefty sums to Trump’s reelection campaign and related super PACs, including the new Trump-focused America PAC and pro-crypto Fairshake.  “It’s not going away. It’s amazing,” Trump said to Bloomberg Businessweek about crypto, adding that he’s “gotten to know a lot of people” from the crypto industry at his fundraisers, calling them “top-flight people.”  Once an outspoken crypto skeptic, Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek that he’s pivoted to embracing the industry because “if we don’t do it, China is going to pick it up and China’s going to have it – or somebody else, but most likely China. China’s very much into it.”  “We have a good foundation,” Trump said of the U.S. crypto industry. “It’s a baby. It’s an infant right now. But I don’t want to be responsible for allowing another country to take over this sphere.”  Read more: Trump Odds on Polymarket Hit Another All-Time High After Vance VP Pick",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/16/trump-says-hell-release-fourth-nft-collection-the-people-want-me-to-do-another-one,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e49e4944377d7b0a17bbaf6f6f14bfd6b32af0b9-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite the retracement earlier today, BTC is firm and trending above the $60,000 psychological round number. At the same time, ETH and SOL prices are firm above $3,300 and $155. Bitcoin, Crypto Prices Rising Though Liquidity Is Low One analyst has picked out an anomaly as crypto and altcoin prices push higher, recovering after the June and early July drawdown. Taking to X, one observer noted that the rally is organic. Related Reading: Why Is The Ethereum Price Up Today? Of note, there are no usual catalysts, including an uptick in liquidity marked by steep inflows, as expected when the market spikes. As seen in the past, and especially when prices rose in 2021 due to central banks across the world easing or after the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, there are no signs that prices are edging higher due to more capital pouring in. At the same time, it happens when the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) has not slashed rates, like in 2020 through 2021, triggering a lift-off now that inflation was expected to rise, and it did. What’s happening is that Bitcoin and crypto prices are edging higher without major catalysts. A major reprieve came when the German government finally sold all its coins by July 12. This coincided with Bitcoin and crypto prices bouncing from July lows. The bounce saw BTC clear immediate liquidation levels, now support, to float above $62,000. Will The Next BTC Bull Run Be “Crazier” And “Longer”? For this reason, the analyst thinks the upcoming bull run will be not only “crazier” but also more extended. At press time, Bitcoin remains firm, expanding above $60,000, and traders expect more gains in the days ahead. Technically, buyers have the upper hand now that prices are trending above the middle BB for the first time in over four weeks. Buyers are unyielding, soaking in the selling pressure of July 4 and 5. Still, optimism is high that Bitcoin has more room to bounce. A key resistance line to watch in the days ahead is $66,000. If this level is broken, the odds of BTC floating above $72,000, a zone that wasn’t broken in June, remain high. Drivers of this leg up would include hopes of the United States Fed slashing rates by the end of the year. More traders are betting on multiple rate cuts by the end of the year.

Gox Payout Worries; XRP Leads Crypto Rally,"The crypto rebound from last week's low showed no signs of stopping with bitcoin {{BTC}} hitting its highest price in four weeks on Tuesday.  BTC surged above the $65,000 level for the first time since late June, shrugging off a dip below $63,000 earlier in the day as wallets related to the defunct Mt. Gox exchange's estate moved $2.8 billion worth of BTC, likely preparing to distribute assets to creditors in the coming days.  The crypto rally was broad-based, showcased by the market benchmark CoinDesk 20 index (CD20) gaining nearly 3% over the past 24 hours with 16 of the 20 constituents in the green during the day.  The strongest performer among altcoin majors was XRP {{XRP}}, the native token of the XRP Ledger payment network, up 9% during Tuesday and extending its weekly gains to 35%.  The token's rally is supported by whales, or large asset holders, increasing their holdings, in a sign conviction in higher prices, crypto data provider Santiment pointed out.  Another catalyst was traditional derivatives trading powerhouses CME and CF Benchmarks announcing indices and reference rates for XRP. These offerings may boost institutional adoption for XRP, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of closely related blockchain payments firm Ripple, suggested.  Mt. Gox sell pressure ""overestimated""  As Germany's BTC sales are behind, crypto investors mull how much of the $9 billion bitcoin about to be distributed to creditors will be dumped on the market to capitalize on the asset's appreciation after ten years of waiting.  Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, argued that fears over the sell pressure is ""overestimated"" and will not derail the crypto rally underway.  ""I believe this distribution won't end the bullish trend, as the coins are expected to react to market sentiment similarly to the existing bitcoin supply,"" he explained in an X post. ""Unlike the German government selling, Mt. Gox creditors aren't forced to sell, so it's not purely sell-side liquidity.""  Well-followed crypto and macro analyst Alex Krüger estimated a 10% price drop at maximum for bitcoin if creditors dump their reclaimed assets en masse, Ju pointed out.  CoinMetrics also said that the market should absorb Mt. Gox creditors liquidating their assets if they happen orderly and spread through weeks based on bitcoin's current market depth and trading volumes.  ""The distribution of ~65,000 BTC (worth approximately $1.95B at current prices) could potentially be absorbed by the market over a period of a couple weeks without causing severe disruptions, assuming the liquidations are done gradually and across multiple exchanges,"" CoinMetrics analysts wrote in a Tuesday report.

31083273,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629975,1721163630,"Crypto Analyst Says Telegram-Based Notcoin Is Ready To Fly, Here’s How High","The Telegram-based Notcoin token has been making waves since it was introduced to the crypto market a few months ago. Following the market decline, it staged one of the strongest recoveries, rising over 50% in a single day. Given its bullish tendencies, expectations around the altcoin is that it will continue to rise, with one crypto analyst predicting how far the Notcoin price could go from here. Notcoin Price Could Rise To $0.018 In an analysis posted on TradingView, a crypto analyst who goes by “The57Trader” has proposed a bullish scenario for Notcoin. In this case, the altcoin is expected to continue to rise, with a price surge toward its current all-time high levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Gear Up For Recovery – Can Spot ETFs Push Price To New Highs? The crypto analyst points out that the Notcoin price has actually formed a bullish flag pattern, which forms the basis for this prediction. However, like with all bullish formations, there are levels that the altcoin must hold in order for it to confirm the rally. In this case, that level is the $0.016 area, and it serves as a support for the Notcoin price through market fluctuations. Now, if the altcoin is able to hold this level, then the price could continue to fly, with targets at $0.01731 and $0.01846. However, on the chance that the Notcoin price is unable to hold this level, then the price decline is expected to continue. The target in this case is place at $0.01478, which is around a 15% decline from the support level of $0.016. NOT Breaks Below $0.016 Support Holding the $0.016 support is important to the crypto analyst’s Notcoin price prediction. However, the altcoin has been unable to maintain this level. At the time of writing, the price had already fallen below the $0.016 price level once, suggesting an invalidation of this prediction. Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana Price Could Rise 450% To $840 – Here Are The Drivers Going by the analysis, then from here, the Notcoin price could continue its decline. A crash from here would no doubt be gut-wrenching for investors, but given the altcoin’s past performances following crashes, it is possible that this decline would not last long. However, so far, the Notcoin price has still continued to skirt around the $0.016 level, suggesting that bulls are still in the game. However, if the Bitcoin price continues to decline and drag the crypto market down with it, then the altcoin could see further crashes. For now, the price has recovered above $0.0163 once again, but posting 1.06% losses in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap. It is one of the only coins recording losses in the last 24 hours following the Bitcoin recovery above $60,000.

The notice – which must be displayed on Wright’s website for six months – declares that Wright lied “extensively and repeatedly” in court proceedings where he claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, and “attempted to create a false narrative by forging documents ‘on a grand scale’.” Wright’s web of lies, spun through “multiple legal actions” constitute a “most serious abuse” of the legal systems in the U.K., Norway, and the U.S., the declaration reads. It also links visitors to the full judgment against Wright, and “its appendix detailing various forged documents created by Dr. Wright.”  The notice is part of a dissemination order granted by the U.K. judge, Justice James Mellor, overseeing the case brought against Wright by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a non-profit organization representing Bitcoin developers.  COPA, which is funded by crypto industry heavyweights like Block’s Jack Dorsey and Coinbase as well as organizations like the Human Rights Watch, sued Wright in 2021 to get a once-and-for-all ruling that he is not Nakamoto to prevent him claiming copyright of the Bitcoin whitepaper and from suing his critics and developers alike under the guise that he created Bitcoin.  Earlier this year, Mellor ruled that Wright was not the creator of Bitcoin. In a written judgment that followed two months later, he declared that Wright had lied throughout the trial and forged evidence.  On Tuesday, Mellor issued a final judgment in the case referring Wright – as well as his colleague and go-to character witness, nChain co-founder Stefan Matthews, to U.K. prosecutors, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to be considered for perjury charges.  The dissemination order granted by Mellor was part of his final judgment. Wright was also ordered to post a similar notice on his Twitter/X account and on the Slack channels where he communicates with his supporters.  When Wright posted the notice to his Twitter/X account, he also tweeted out a link to his personal website, adding ""This is a requirement until I appeal the decision.""  In Mellor’s final judgment, he said that Wright has made “no application for permission to appeal” despite what he has said on social media.

In the 4-hour chart against Tether (USDT), the Shiba Inu price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, traditionally recognized as a bullish reversal signal following a downtrend. Shiba Inu Price Eyes 45% Rally The inverse head and shoulders pattern is marked by three troughs with the middle trough (head) deeper than the flanking ones (shoulders), and it is the opposite of the traditional head and shoulders bearish pattern. The shoulders are ideally of equal depth, and the head is a clear dip below the shoulders. A key feature of this pattern is the ‘neckline,’ a resistance line drawn by connecting the high points of the two troughs forming the shoulders. A decisive breakout above this neckline is generally perceived as a confirmation of the pattern and signals the start of a potential bullish trend. Related Reading: Forbes Says Shiba Inu Price Will Rise 1,700% To Reach $0.0003 ATH, Here’s When In his chart, the crypto analyst highlights this breakout signal. The neckline, drawn in red, has been breached on Saturday, July 13, with a closing price above this line, signaling bullish momentum. The left shoulder and right shoulder are aligned at approximately $0.000016, framing the head which dips below $0.000013. This dip, followed by a rebound to the second shoulder, completes the formation and sets the stage for potential upward movement. Notably, the crypto analyst identifies three potential targets post-breakout which investors might aim for. The first target is at $0.0000209, representing an initial resistance level past the breakout point. The second target lies at $0.0000239 and could serve as a mid-term goal for the price following the breach. The ultimate target at $0.0000285 reflects the full potential of the breakout, equating to an approximate 45% increase from the neckline breakout level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Sharp 100% Decline In Whale Activity, Is This Good Or Bad For Price? Moreover, an important element in the chart is the ascending blue trendline. This line, starting from the base of the head and moving upward through the formation of the right shoulder, underpins the bullish sentiment, illustrated by a rising support level. This trendline not only confirms the higher lows, which align with the bullish reversal pattern, but also serves as a dynamic support that can guide trading decisions. A bounce off this trendline could offer additional buying opportunities, reinforcing confidence in the continuation of the uptrend. For traders looking to capitalize on this setup, it is essential to manage risk. The analysis suggests a stop loss at $0.0000140. Furthermore, the pullback level marked at $0.0000150 is highlighted as a crucial support area. If the entire market is about to see another major correction, this price could serve as the ultimate “buy-the-dip” level. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00001925.

42390731,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8U4z,1721157251,DePIN Can Make Car Ownership Cool Again,"The automotive industry is at a crossroads. We’re racing towards a future of electric vehicles and autonomous driving, yet something meaningful seems to be slipping away: the joy of car ownership. The passion and personality that once defined car culture is fading, replaced by a less exciting world where vehicles are mere transportation devices.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  But what if the unlikely combination of blockchain technology and the automotive world could reignite that spark?  That's where decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) come in. While much of crypto has been overly focused on speculative trading and other exclusively digital products, DePIN networks connect blockchain to the physical world. From Helium's decentralized wireless networks to Render's distributed GPU platform, innovators are finding ways to build better infrastructure while making the ownership of physical assets more rewarding, more engaging, and frankly, more fun.  So, how does this relate to cars? Enter DIMO, a DePIN network built to improve the car ownership experience with cutting-edge vehicle integration technology. It works by giving vehicles an on-chain identity and putting owners in control of the car and its data to unlock entirely new services, experiences and economic opportunities.  For most people, their car is the second-largest purchase they'll ever make after their home. Each year, it’ll cost them about $12,000, require painful pilgrimages to the DMV, and maybe even sabotage a trip with a surprise check engine light or flat tire.  We have the opportunity to not just revolutionize industries, but to fundamentally change how people interact with and derive value from the world around them  It’s 2024. Modern technology should have made ownership cheaper, easier and more rewarding by now. Not only should you be saving way more money on expenses and automating all the hassle, you should be earning money by monetizing your vehicle data, something experts say could be worth $800 billion by 2030, and you should have access to a rich ecosystem of apps and services built for you and your vehicle. The siloed approach that automakers have thus far pursued in implementing smart vehicle technology has held this future back. It has been a disaster for security, privacy and openness.  Imagine earning crypto tokens for simply owning a car, while the data you opt-in to sharing contributes to improved traffic management, better urban planning, cheaper insurance and a better eventual trade-in value for your car. Suddenly, your depreciating asset becomes a source of passive income.  But DePIN's potential goes beyond just financial incentives. It's about revolutionizing the entire ownership experience. Remember when customizing your car was a point of pride? Your Dad might have spent his weekends tinkering under the hood of his 1987 Firebird. There’s probably a few Polaroids of him posing in front of it hidden inside a shoebox in your basement.  DePIN could bring back that sense of personalization and community, but in a distinctly modern way. Imagine a world where your car has an on-chain digital twin, allowing you to customize its appearance, participate in virtual car shows or even race digital versions of your real-world vehicle. Your car becomes a key to a whole new ecosystem. This gamification of car ownership could extend to the real world, too. Blockchain-based systems could reward safe driving, optimal route-taking or real-world carbon offsets. Suddenly, your daily commute becomes a game, with valuable rewards at stake.  But perhaps one of the most exciting potential use cases for DePIN in the automotive world is the transformation of commerce and registration. In our blockchain-enabled future, receiving the title, financing your car, insuring it, and registering could be done in seconds, whether you’re buying new from a dealer or from a random guy named Bert on Craigslist.  Your car will have its own wallet, able to pay for fuel, tolls or Starbucks. No waiting an hour at the DMV just to be told, “you have the wrong kind of paperwork, come back tomorrow.” No more pulling out quarters or downloading a bad government app just to pay for street parking. It would be impossible to build a system that is open and trusted enough that can coordinate all of these complex transactions, without blockchain and DIMO.  Read more: Scott Foo - Welcome to DePIN Summer  Of course, for DePIN to truly succeed in the automotive space and beyond, it needs to overcome the issue of accessibility. For too long, the crypto world has been a tech club, with high barriers to entry in terms of technical knowledge and financial risk. DePIN projects need to focus on creating user-friendly interfaces that hide the complexity of blockchain technology. The average car owner shouldn't need to understand smart contracts or private keys to benefit from these systems.  This isn't a pipe dream. The groundwork is being laid at DIMO today, where nearly 100,000 cars are connected and the infrastructure that will make scenarios like this a reality is coming together.  For those of us passionate about both technology and the physical world, it's an exciting road ahead. We have the opportunity to not just revolutionize industries, but to fundamentally change how people interact with and derive value from the world around them.  The principles that DePIN is applying to vehicles can be extended to virtually any physical asset. Your home could earn tokens by contributing to a decentralized energy grid. Your smartphone could be rewarded for participating in a distributed computing network. The key is to create systems that offer immediate, tangible benefits to users while building towards a more decentralized, user-centric future. It's about using blockchain technology not as an end in itself, but as a tool to enhance our interaction with the physical world.  So, the next time you get behind the wheel, imagine a future where your car isn’t just about getting from A to B, but a seamless extension of your daily life and your personality in the real world and online. That's the future we're building. And who knows? It might just make owning a car cool again.

42390735,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8UUd,1721156240,Bitcoin Miner Northern Data Moves to Dismiss Ex-Employees’ Whistleblower Suit,"European bitcoin mining firm Northern Data is pushing back against a whistleblower suit filed by two former executives of the company who say they were wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about the company’s financial health and alleging tax evasion.  On Monday evening, lawyers for Northern Data filed a motion to dismiss the federal case, calling it a “textbook example of bad faith litigation” and alleging that the two plaintiffs – Gulsen Kama and Joshua Porter – had “unproductive, brief tenures at the company” after which Kama was fired for cause and Porter was laid off for his “lack of productivity”  “When Porter and Kama made extortionate demands for ‘severance’ payments, Northern Data rejected them,” Northern Data’s lawyers wrote in the motion to dismiss. “In response, both employees now style themselves as ‘whistleblowers’ and seek to profit personally and financially from allegations that they know – and have every reason to know – are false.”  The Monday filing also pointed out that Kama’s suit against Northern Data is not her first rodeo filing lawsuits against her former employers. In 2019, she filed a whistleblower suit against tax preparer Jackson Hewitt, alleging that she was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns that the company lied about potentially relocating in order to get a $2.7 million tax break from the state of New Jersey. Last year, Kama filed suit against another employer, Quest Diagnostics, alleging workplace discrimination on the basis of her sex and ethnicity. The results of those whistleblower cases were not immediately clear.  A lawyer for Kama and Porter did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  Northern Data’s motion to dismiss is fairly procedural in nature, arguing that the California court overseeing the case should toss it out due to a lack of jurisdiction over the corporate defendants (in this case, the U.S. subsidiaries of the German tech company), who are incorporated in Delaware and have principal places of business in Virginia. The lawyers also argue that the fraud claims – which they describe as “inflammatory but completely unsupported” – lack sufficient particularity.  A hearing to discuss the motion to dismiss will be held in a Los Angeles court on Aug. 19, 2024 at 1:30 pm local time (20:30 UTC).  Explosive allegations  Kama and Porter’s first amended complaint against their former employer contained explosive allegations that Northern Data lied to investors about the strength of its finances, hiding the fact that it is “borderline insolvent,” and, additionally, is “knowingly committing tax evasion to the tune of potentially tens of millions of dollars.”  The allegations came amidst growing media buzz that the Tether-backed tech firm is considering a U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of its artificial intelligence unit, which Bloomberg reported was valued at up to $16 billion.  In their Monday motion, lawyers for Northern Data declined to comment on market speculation but stressed that, if it were true, “the period leading up to an IPO is a particularly sensitive time for a company. As Plaintiffs undoubtedly know, public accusations of fraud – no matter how irresponsible – can disrupt that process.”  Porter and Kama have alleged that the firm had a “$30 [million] German tax liability and additional liabilities of almost $8 [million] while simultaneously having only $17 [million] cash on the balance and a monthly burn rate of $3 [million]-$4 [million].” Their suit also alleges that the firm committed “rampant tax evasion” in its early years and had no plan to take remedial measures to account for it, potentially leaving them liable for “tens of millions of dollars” in U.S. tax liabilities if it were to be audited.  Both Kama and Porter claimed they were fired after bringing their concerns to supervisors.

42390739,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8UZl,1721154066,ETF Stands for 'Everything That Fits',"One of the main crypto narratives this year has been the approval and trading of U.S. spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). They have been a resounding success. Not only have the bitcoin ETFs attracted $16 billion of inflows in half a year, the price of bitcoin (and therefore the prices of these ETFs) has increased by 46%.  The ETFs' success is so obvious that BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink came out and said he likes bitcoin now (and not just because it can make his firm money!). In a recent interview with CNBC, Fink said, “My opinion five years ago was wrong. I believe bitcoin is a legitimate financial instrument.”  To be sure, the assets under management (AUM) attributable to IBIT, BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, remains miniscule in the face of BlackRock’s total AUM (if you take out the AUM of IBIT – $18 billion – from BlackRock’s total AUM of $10.6 trillion, you’re still left with $10.6 trillion). Still, Fink's comment further legitimizes bitcoin in the eyes of the Boomer financial advisors now that firms like BlackRock and Fidelity (still waiting on Vanguard) bless bitcoin as a legitimate asset with a place in portfolios.  So Bitcoin, at least in this way, is here to stay.  What about what’s next? Well, an ether spot ETF, of course, which may begin trading next week and is also expected to be a success (albeit on a smaller scale than the Bitcoin ETF).  And then after that? Well, Solana ETFs naturally.  Over a billion, 300 million, trillion, 300 million ETFs  While I still personally maintain that bitcoin is different from other cryptocurrencies and is the only one which concretely does what it sets out to do, I think it is (and was) a significant mistake to assume bitcoin was in any way special in the eyes of high finance and Wall Street and, by extension, ETF issuers.  The U.S. ETF market is immense. Check the statistics from the Investment Company Institute for 2023: $8 trillion of assets; 218 firms providing ETFs; 3,108 total ETFs! And with good reason. ETFs make it trivial to compose your portfolio according to whatever investment thesis you may have.  For example, if you wanted to invest in healthcare or consumer discretionary goods there are sector ETFs for that. Say you’re young and want to chuck most of your portfolio into the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100. Just buy up a bunch of Invesco’s ETF QQQ, which tracks that. Whatever the idea, there’s an ETF for that.  They even have ETFs for more amusing, potentially farcical, ideas.  Say you’re young and want to chuck most of your portfolio into the Nasdaq-100, but also you want to get rich three times as fast. You can buy TQQQ, which is the same as QQQ but it goes up (and down) three times as fast (this is achieved through debt, or leverage, hence the term “triple levered ETFs”).  What if you want to buy an ETF even Jesus would like? Try WWJD. Do you see the virtue in vice and want to invest in worldly sins? Try VICE. What if you totally hate the investment advice of CNBC’s Jim Cramer? Try SJIM, the Inverse Cramer ETF, which follows the exact opposite of Cramer’s advice (not for nothing, this ETF no longer exists, but it used to!).  With this in mind, it’s plain that it wasn’t ever going to be “the Bitcoin ETF is the only ETF that will exist because bitcoin is better than the others and the SEC knows this.”  Two years ago I wrote:  “If the SEC decided tomorrow that bitcoin was a security, it would change nothing about bitcoin fundamentally. It would also change nothing about bitcoin market manipulation being bad. It would just change who thinks they can regulate it at this particular moment.”  Philosophically, it didn’t matter if cryptos were securities then, and it doesn’t matter now. So now the Bitcoin spot ETF has come to the U.S. and next comes one for Ethereum and then the next one and the next and the next until we finally stop and ask ourselves: What exactly is stopping the potential issuance of a meme coin ETF? Before you answer: “meme coins are securities,” remember that plenty of ETFs have securities in them (QQQ, TQQQ, WWJD, VICE).  As long as regulators are allowing new, shiny crypto ETFs, then the firms which provide ETFs will continue to provide them to the market because that’s what ETF providers do for a living. They make ETFs, investors buy them, and providers make a fee for managing them.  Even though it seems now that if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it will be stuffed à la turducken into an ETF, I do believe that cooler heads will (eventually) prevail, among investors and/or regulators. Even if it takes a Duckley ETF for that to happen.

42390734,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8UA7,1721153667,"Web3-AI: What’s Real, and What’s Hype","The Web3-AI space is one of the hottest in crypto, combining great promise with significant hype. It almost feels heretical to point out the number of Web3-AI projects with multi-billion dollar market caps but no practical use cases, driven purely by proxy narratives from the traditional AI market. Meanwhile, the gap in AI capabilities between Web2 and Web3 continues to widen alarmingly. However, Web3-AI is not all hype. Recent developments in the generative AI market highlight the value proposition of more decentralized approaches.  Considering all these factors, we find ourselves in an overhyped and overfunded market that is disconnected from the state of the generative AI industry, yet capable of unlocking tremendous value for the next wave of generative AI. Feeling confused is understandable. If we step back from the hype and analyze the Web3-AI space through the lens of current requirements, clear areas emerge where Web3 can deliver substantial value. But this requires cutting through a dense reality distortion field.  Web3-AI Reality Distortion  As crypto natives, we tend to see the value of decentralization in everything. However, AI has evolved as an increasingly centralized force in terms of data and computation, so the value proposition of decentralized AI needs to start by countering that natural centralization force.  When it comes to AI, there is an increasing mismatch between the value we perceive to be creating in Web3 and the needs of the AI market. The concerning reality is that the gap between Web2 and Web3 AI is widening rather than shrinking, driven fundamentally by three key factors:  Limited AI Research Talent  The number of AI researchers working in Web3 is in the low single-digits. This is hardly encouraging for those who claim that Web3 is the future of AI.  Constrained Infrastructure  We haven’t yet managed to get web apps to work properly with Web3 backends, so thinking about AI is a stretch, to say the least. Web3 infrastructure imposes computational constraints that are impractical for the lifecycle of generative AI solutions.  Limited Models, Data, and Computational Resources  Generative AI relies on three things: models, data and compute. None of the large frontier models are equipped to run on Web3 infrastructures; there is no foundation for large training datasets; and there is a massive quality gap between Web3 GPU clusters and those required for pretraining and fine-tuning foundation models.  The difficult reality is that Web3 has been building a “poor man’s” version of AI, essentially trying to match the capabilities of Web2 AI but creating inferior versions. This reality starkly contrasts with the tremendous value proposition of decentralization in several areas of AI.  To avoid making this analysis as an abstract thesis, let’s dive into different decentralized AI trends and evaluate them against their AI market potential.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - Funding Open-Source Generative AI With Crypto  The reality distortion in Web3-AI has led the initial wave of innovation and funding to focus on projects whose value propositions seem disconnected from the realities of the AI market. At the same time, there are other emerging areas in Web3-AI that hold tremendous potential.  Some Overhyped Web3-AI Trends  Decentralized GPU Infrastructure for Training and Fine-Tuning  In the last few years, we have seen an explosion of decentralized GPU infrastructures with the promise of democratizing the pretraining and fine-tuning of foundation models. The idea is to enable an alternative to the GPU monopolization established by incumbent AI labs. The reality is that the pretraining and fine-tuning of large foundation models require large GPU clusters with super-fast communication buses connecting them. A pretraining cycle of a 50B-100B foundation model in a decentralized AI infrastructure could take over a year, if it works at all.  ZK-AI Frameworks  The idea of combining zero-knowledge (zk) computations and AI has sparked interesting concepts to enable privacy mechanisms in foundation models. Given the prominence of zk infrastructure in Web3, several frameworks promise to embed zk computation in foundation models. Although theoretically appealing, zk-AI models quickly encounter the challenge of being prohibitively expensive from a computational standpoint when applied to large models. Additionally, zk will limit aspects such as interpretability, which is one of the most promising areas in generative AI.  Proof-Of-Inference  Crypto is about cryptographic proofs, and sometimes these are attached to things that don’t need them. In the Web3-AI space, we see examples of frameworks issuing cryptographic proofs of specific model outputs. The challenges with these scenarios are not technological but market-related. Basically, proof-of-inference is somewhat of a solution looking for a problem and lacks any real use cases today.  Some High Potential Web3-AI Trends  Agents with Wallets  Agentic workflows are one of the most interesting trends in generative AI and hold significant potential for crypto. By agents, we are referring to AI programs that can not only passively answer questions based on inputs, but also execute actions against a given environment. While most autonomous agents are created for isolated use cases, we are seeing the rapid emergence of multi-agent environments and collaboration.  This is an area where crypto can unlock tremendous value. For instance, imagine a scenario where an agent needs to hire other agents to complete a task or stake some value to vouch for the quality of its outputs. Provisioning agents with financial primitives in the form of crypto rails unlocks many use cases for agentic collaboration.  Crypto Funding for AI  One of the best-known secrets in generative AI is that the open-source AI space is undergoing a tremendous funding crunch. Most open-source AI labs can’t afford to work on large models anymore and instead are focusing on other areas that don’t require massive amounts of compute access and data. Crypto is extremely efficient at capital formation with mechanisms such as airdrops, incentives or even points. The concept of crypto funding rails for open-source generative AI is one of the most promising areas at the intersection of these two trends.  Small Foundation Models  Last year, Microsoft coined the term small language model (SLM) after the release of its Phi model, which, with less than 2B parameters, was able to outperform much larger LLMs in computer science and math tasks. Small foundation models – think 1B-5B parameters – are a key requirement for the viability of decentralized AI and unlock promising scenarios for on-device AI. Decentralizing multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is nearly impossible today and will remain so for a while. However, small foundation models should be able to run on many of today’s Web3 infrastructures. Pushing the SLM agenda is essential for building real value with Web3 and AI.  Synthetic Data Generation  Data scarcity is one of the biggest challenges with this latest generation of foundation models. As a result, there is an increasing level of research focused on synthetic data generation mechanisms using foundation models that can complement real-world datasets. The mechanics of crypto networks and token incentives can ideally coordinate a large number of parties to collaborate in creating new synthetic datasets.  Other Relevant Web3-AI Trends  There are several other interesting Web3-AI trends with significant potential. Proof-of-Human outputs is becoming increasingly relevant given the challenges with AI-generated content. Evaluation and benchmarking is an AI segment in which the trust and transparency capabilities of Web3 can shine. Human-centric fine-tuning, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), is also an interesting scenario for Web3 networks. Other scenarios are likely to emerge as generative AI continues to evolve and Web3-AI capabilities mature.  The need for more decentralized AI capabilities is very real. While the Web3 industry might not yet be in a position to rival the value created by the AI mega models, it can unlock real value for the generative AI space. The biggest challenge for the evolution of Web3-AI might be overcoming its own reality distortion field. There is plenty of value in Web3-AI; we just need to focus on building real things.

This spike highlights the active trading and increasing investor interest in the well-loved meme currency, paving the way for future price changes and tactical adjustments within the SHIB community. Related Reading: Render (RNDR) Attracts Big Investors: $1 Million+ Whale Moves On The Rise Strategic Buying Ahead Of The Burn The Shiba Inu community is getting ready for a big token burn that the market is expecting to happen soon. In anticipation of the impending burn, which will take 250 million SHIB out of circulation, there has been a deliberate build-up of the token across many wallets. Take a look at this image. @1cDream The #shib pooled is at 800 million. The price just made a clear break of that trend line. We also are getting a substantial amount in our wallet ready for the next shib burn which is scheduled at 250 million. Tomorrow I am trading live at… pic.twitter.com/SISivtChdO — Casey Stubbs (@caseystubbs) July 15, 2024 The purpose of token burns is to intentionally decrease the amount of tokens in circulation, making the remaining tokens more valuable. This action is anticipated to increase SHIB’s value, and the community’s initiative shows that they strongly believe in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Investors are showing their faith in Shiba Inu’s future by gathering tokens and getting ready for the burn. This action demonstrates a general optimism within the SHIB community in addition to supporting the ecosystem’s strategic efforts. Market Sentiment And Spiking Transactions The amount of SHIB transactions has dramatically increased, according to recent data. Shiba Inu transaction volume hit an amazing 5.71 trillion SHIB in a single day on July 8, 2024, according to IntoTheBlock. This increase in transaction volume may indicate planned phases of accumulation or distribution since it indicates increased activity and participation from key holders. The market still has mixed feelings about SHIB, but most people are optimistic. Based on what we know now, the price of Shiba Inu will have dropped by about -4.04%, or $0.00001831, by August 15, 2024. At 62, the Fear & Greed Index shows that people are moving towards Greed, but the general mood is still neutral despite this short drop. Since SHIB has had 16 “green” days out of the last 30, and its price has changed by 7.25%, buyers may have chances to buy strategically given the way the market is right now. Analysis By Experts Meanwhile, Himanshu Maradiya, founder and head of the CIFDAQ Blockchain Ecosystem, is not sure how SHIB will fare in the future. He knows that the cryptocurrency market is always changing and that Shiba Inu is a very risky memecoin. Maradiya says that buyers shouldn’t be expecting big price gains. Instead, they should focus on small returns that they can actually achieve. More seriously, he thinks that Shiba Inus will cost between $0.0001 and $0.0003 by 2024 or 2025, given that the market stays strong and the SHIB ecosystem continues to grow. The community of Shiba Inus has been aggressively supporting the long-term possibilities of the SHIB token. The deliberate emphasis on carefully amassing and then burning tokens shows a great faith in the basic value proposition of the asset. Related Reading: Big Filecoin Rally Ahead: Analyst Predicts 4,000% ‘Uphill Run’ The Shiba Inu ecosystem seems ready for more expansion even if opinions on more general cryptocurrencies vary. Important markers, like constantly rising transaction volumes and liquidity, point to rising token acceptance and use. Furthermore, the tactical moves of the community—including the forthcoming coordinated token burn—have the power to greatly affect SHIB’s worth and general appeal in the next months and years. Analytically, although market projections remain cautiously optimistic, projecting SHIB price targets in the range of $0.0001 to $0.0003 over the next couple of years, the community’s shown dedication to the token’s development and utility justifies close observation by both enthusiasts and investors equally. Particularly the forthcoming burn event will be a turning point that can change Shiba Inu’s course of development and confirm its place in the larger cryptocurrency scene.

42390730,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8Tuj,1721152346,Detained Binance Exec Tigran Gambaryan Wheeled into Nigerian Court as Health Deteriorates,"Detained American Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan had to be pushed into a Abuja, Nigeria courtroom today in a wheelchair after a herniated disc in his back left him in severe pain and “hardly able to walk,” according to a Monday report from his family.  Gambaryan’s health has steadily deteriorated since he was detained in Nigeria in February. At first, Gambaryan was placed under home detention but was later transferred to the notoriously dangerous Kuje prison – which holds violent criminals including members of the Boko Haram terrorist group – after his colleague and fellow detainee, British-Kenyan citizen Nadeem Anjarwalla, escaped.  Gambaryan, a former Internal Revenue Service agent and Binance’s current head of financial crime compliance, voluntarily traveled to Nigeria in February to meet with government officials. He was subsequently detained without explanation and later charged with money laundering and tax evasion – essentially as a scapegoat for his employer, which Nigerian officials have accused of tanking the value of the naira. The tax evasion charges against Gambaryan were later dropped. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.  Since his transfer to Kuje prison, Gambaryan is believed to have contracted malaria and suffered double pneumonia, complained of numbness in his foot, and has collapsed in court at least once. The judge overseeing Gambaryan’s money laundering trial has issued a court order to officials at Kuje prison to release his medical records, but they have not complied.  In a statement to CoinDesk, Gambaryan’s wife Yuki said she was “heartbroken to see my once fit and healthy husband reduced to such a condition.”  “This ordeal has taken a severe toll on him, leaving him in so much pain that he can hardly walk,"" she said in the statement. ""I do not understand why this is being allowed to continue,"" she continued. ""Tigran is innocent. All he did was dutifully travel to Nigeria for a meeting.. “Now our lives have been turned upside down and his health is at serious risk. I am pleading with the Nigerian authorities to urgently release my husband on humanitarian grounds. This situation is destroying him. I need him safely home with us right now.""  The Biden Administration has come under fire for seemingly doing little to aid Gambaryan.  Two members of Congress, Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Penn.) visited Gambaryan in prison last month, and asked the U.S. embassy to advocate for his humanitarian release due to the “horrible conditions in the prison, his innocence and his health.”  Hill was one of the 12 signatories on a letter from members of Congress to President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger D. Carstens urging Gambaryan’s case to be treated as a hostage situation.  A State Department spokesperson told CoinDesk earlier this year that the department was ""aware of reports"" of Gambaryan's detention, while a White House spokesperson later referred CoinDesk back to the State Department.  Without intervention, Gambaryan will likely be stuck in Kuje prison through the fall. His money laundering trial has been adjourned to October while the Nigerian courts close for the summer.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/16/detained-binance-exec-tigran-gambaryan-wheeled-into-nigerian-court-as-health-deteriorates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/581a58673d7527a6b8051c010843d9069d2a2983-4454x2506.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ETFs took in $300 million alone on Monday, continuing a seven-day inflow streak.  Lifetime net inflows into the U.S.-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds topped $16 billion on Monday as investors of late have shown themselves to be buyers in both up and down markets.  The funds yesterday added another $300 million, marking the seventh consecutive day of overall net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors.  Most of the money was poured into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which took in $117.2 million. Currently with $18.4 billion in assets under management, IBIT appears poised to soon cross the $20 billion mark, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Frund (FBTC) is nearing the $10 billion AUM threshold.  The strong inflows came as bitcoin bounced strongly from the mid-$50K area at which it had been stuck in since earlier this month when Germany’s sale of 50,000 BTC combined with Mt. Gox repayments to crash the market.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} at press time was trading at $64,600, up about 13% from levels seen late Friday afternoon.  This long streak of ETF inflows is particularly notable as it began alongside bitcoin's early July plunge, with net additions ranging from $140 million to $300 million per day. The action stands in contrast with ideas from a few bears in the space who have contended that much of the ETF interest was hot money that would dump the funds at the first sign of price trouble.  Inflows also come as issuers of a potential spot ether ETF prepare to submit their final documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) who signaled that the funds could hit the market as soon as Tuesday, July 23.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/16/bitcoin-etf-traders-bought-the-dip-and-now-are-buying-the-rebound-as-inflows-topped-300m-monday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f85091350b16d4fe9ac59242d1ee85199a0f5b7-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products recorded $1.44 billion worth of inflows last week, which is a further indication of the return of bullish momentum into the crypto industry. This brings the total inflow to $1.881 billion over a two-week period after three consecutive weeks of outflows. With last week’s numbers, the total value of inflows into crypto investment funds this year now stands at a record $17.8 billion. Bullish Return Among Institutional Crypto Investors The latest data shows that crypto investment products are starting to reflect the overall change in market sentiment. As noted by CoinShares’ latest weekly report, this change into bullish sentiment has allowed digital investment products to further surpass the $10.6 billion inflow received during the 2021 bull market. Related Reading: JPMorgan Says Crypto Liquidations Will End And Bitcoin Bull Market Will Begin, Here’s When Last week’s inflows amounted to $1.44 billion, which is the 5th largest weekly inflow on record. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin received the lion’s share of the investments. As the world’s first and largest crypto asset, Bitcoin has always been the centre of attraction among other cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency has also been in the spotlight for the past few months since the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. A return of bullish momentum allowed Bitcoin to receive $1.35 billion last week, which is also the fifth-largest weekly inflow on record for Bitcoin. Notably, this inflow came amidst concerns about selling pressure sparked by a selloff of over 45,000 BTC by the German State of Saxony. On the other hand, short-Bitcoin products witnessed $8.6 million worth of outflows. Short-Bitcoin products are for investors who anticipate a decline in the price of Bitcoin. With this in mind, it can be deduced that the withdrawal of short positions is a manifestation of a diminishing bearish outlook among institutional investors. Ethereum led the altcoin market with a net inflow of $72 million, allowing it to reverse its total net inflow this year from a negative $15 million at the beginning of the week to $57 million at the end of the week. Solana exchange-traded products followed suit with a $4.4 million net inflow, a 270% reduction from $16.3 million in the prior week. At the time of writing, Solana’s total inflow this year stands at $62 million. Litecoin, XRP, and Cardano witnessed inflows of $1.2 million, $1.0 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. Multi-asset investment products also recorded $17.2 million in inflows.

Short term resistance at $60k has been surpassed, with the next level at 65k. Monthly chart projections suggest a potential rally to $300k. Bitcoin continues to evolve as a new form of value storage. As anticipated by my last article , Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) appears to have bottomed after testing its 200-day Simple Moving Average in much the same way as it did in September, leading to a large rally. TheBullBear.com, TradingView Short-term resistance in the 60k area has been taken out rather easily: TheBullBear.com, TradingView The next level of resistance is $65k. Sentiment continues to be relatively bearish... alternative.me ...with plenty of room to run before it becomes overly bullish on a historical basis... alternative.me, Crypto Fear-Greed Index Looking at the monthly chart, we can see that the figure of $100k is nothing more than psychological. There's no reason why that has to be a significant stopping point for the coming rally. A better projection is to $300k: TheBullBear.com, TradingView If you look left, you can see that after a similar corrective period, Bitcoin rallied 430% in 6 months to its current levels (and then corrected). A similar 6-month rally to the top of the pink channel would take it 365% higher to the area around $300k. This would complete a 5 wave bullish impulse move and set up another correction. At that point, monthly RSI would be into its upper resistance band. As the global economy transitions from Debt Monetarism into Intelligence Economics, new forms of value storage and transmission will be required to channel flows of value across the new economy. Bitcoin is V.1 of that new form of ""money"". There will be others. Now is a good time to start keeping our eyes out for the emergence of the new class of V.2 currency so we can get in on the ground floor. Please also see: Bitcoin: Bottoming Or Breaking?

42390742,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8Up9,1721143982,Bitcoin 2.0: What’s Next Following the Spot Approval?,"John Stec, Global X ETFs, discusses digital asset adoption, spot Bitcoin ETFs, and how investors are aiming to manage volatility with theGlobal X Bitcoin Trend Strategy ETF (BTRN).  Authors' views and opinions are their own and not associated with CoinDesk Indices. This interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial.  What do general market participants and financial advisors see regarding digital asset adoption?  We’ve seen a tremendous amount of interest in the digital asset space and a corresponding rise in assets. There has been a significant uptick in the number of advisors either looking to allocate to this space or starting a due diligence process. Before 2024, we were roughly at what I call “15-15-70”: 15% of advisors and investors would never consider investing in crypto-themed or crypto-related securities, 15% were early adopters either buying for themselves or clients, and 70% were in a gray area where there wasn’t enough demand, interest, or knowledge to allocate to this space. But now that we have spot bitcoin ETFs and increased asset flows, we have broker-dealers and others looking to purchase Bitcoin ETFs, which we believe has significantly decreased that 70% number.  How have spot Bitcoin ETFs been received in the U.S. and internationally?  At a high-level internationally, several countries have successfully launched spot bitcoin ETFs that are similar to those in the U.S., while others have indicated that they’re in development In the U.S., an ETF wrapper seems to be the preferred vehicle for advisors and investors to access the asset class. We always joked that the “IPO” (Initial Public Offering) of Bitcoin would be the ETF, as this structure allowed easier access to the crypto landscape and opened doors that didn’t exist before. In the U.S., that was the starting point for a lot of people to view digital assets as more of an established asset class that deserved closer attention and consideration. We now have ETFs in place, investors can access them in their brokerage accounts, and the allocation process is very familiar to what they do across their portfolios. With the ETF wrapper, advisors have a simple, regulated, solution for clients to gain exposure to Bitcoin.  Is the audience Bitcoin ETFs primarily advisors or is it across the board?  We still see very heavy retail interest from investors who may not be working with a financial professional. If we think about digital assets and trying to own them individually, it’s still a pretty cumbersome process – there’s a heavy push for self-custody and owning those assets in your custodial possession, and that process can be very unwieldy and challenging for some. When you think about an ETF wrapper that gives you exposure to this space, it brings down what had been a pretty high barrier to entry. So, there’s very heavy interest from retail investors based on the ease of access that the ETF wrapper provides.  Can you dig a little bit into how investors are managing volatility and the Global X Bitcoin Trend Strategy ETF (BTRN)?  The Global X Bitcoin Trend Strategy ETF(BTRN) is constructed to assist in managing different market cycles by offering adaptive exposure to Bitcoin futures aligned with the current price trend of Bitcoin. The core concept of a trend strategy, which this ETF leverages, is that markets gradually react to news and shifts. BTRN aims to harness changes in market sentiment through a systematic and dynamic approach, and seeks to capture upside opportunities while reducing drawdowns compared to a strategy focused solely on Bitcoin futures. In short, we believe BTRN is the next generation of digital asset ETFs.  When we were looking at digital assets, we wanted to help address one of investors’ major concerns with Bitcoin, which is the volatility – was there a way to potentially participate in uptrends and move away or even fully exit your position and hold relatively stable security in significant downtrends? So, we were excited to bring BTRN to market, potentially allowing investors to participate in uptrends while aiming to mitigate any major downside moves by allocating to the Global X 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (CLIP), a fund that invests in a basket of Treasury bills issued by the U.S. government that have a remaining maturity of at least 1 month but less than 3 months, based on trend signals. BTRN is the first ETF to use the CoinDesk Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI) signal, which is based on trend data back-tested over five years and calculated daily.  Are you finding that investors are generally buying and holding the ETF or are they moving in and out of it?  What we’ve seen from digital assets, and the messaging from a lot of managers who’ve brought products to this space, is we have a disruptive trend, and this trend may play out over multiple years. When most investors make an allocation, whether it’s 1% or 5% of their portfolios, they have the intention, I believe, that this is going to be a long-term strategic holding as opposed to trading tactically. Now, of course, you have a percentage of investors who are going to trade Bitcoin and other products more tactically, but I think for the most part investors want to strategically let it play out over several years.  What does the future look like for the digital asset marketplace?  Now that we have the first wave of digital assets and Bitcoin spot products, I think we’ll see an expansion of ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin markets. That can be something similar to the Global X Bitcoin Trend Strategy ETF (BTRN), where investors want to build a risk management strategy around Bitcoin. We may also see some income-producing vehicles around Bitcoin, as well. And then moving beyond Bitcoin, the path is likely to be into the next-largest token, which is Ethereum. With a pending Ethereum spot ETF launch, we believe this asset class may be positioned to have an upward growth trajectory, and as the years move on, we may see the acceptance of other products around different tokens. This could allow for other broad baskets of tokens very similar to what we saw with traditional ETFs. For example, with the S&P 500 Index, there are passive, leveraged, active, and income-producing products based off of it. That said, I think we’re just at the beginning of what we’re going to see from a product development standpoint.

They are subject to unique and substantial risks, and historically, have been subject to significant price volatility. The value of an investment in the Fund could decline significantly and without warning, including to zero. You should be prepared to lose your entire investment.  Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. BTRN invests in bitcoin futures contracts. The fund does not invest directly in or hold bitcoin. The price and performance of bitcoin futures should be expected to differ from the current “spot” price of bitcoin. These differences could be significant. Bitcoin futures are subject to margin requirements, collateral requirements, and other limits that may prevent the ETF from achieving its objective. Margin requirements for futures and costs associated with rolling (buying and selling) futures may have a negative impact on the fund’s performance and its ability to achieve its investment objective. BTRN is non-diversified.  Bitcoin is largely unregulated and bitcoin investments may be more susceptible to fraud and manipulation than more regulated investments. Bitcoin and bitcoin futures are subject to rapid price swings, including as a result of actions and statements by influencers and the media, changes in the supply of and demand for bitcoin and bitcoin futures contracts and other factors. Funds tied to bitcoin may not be suitable for all investors.  Fixed income securities are subject to loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. Government may cause the value of the Fund’s investment in U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.

42390740,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd8Uk1,1721143920,Trump Odds on Polymarket Hit Another All-Time High After Vance VP Pick,"Donald Trump's odds of retaking the White House in November hit another all-time high after he picked Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) as his running mate, traders on the crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket are signaling.  ""Yes"" shares for Trump in Polymarket's presidential election contract were trading at 72 cents mid-morning Tuesday New York time, indicating that the market believes the Republican nominee has a 72% chance of victory. Each share pays out $1 if the associated prediction comes true and bupkis if not. Bets are programmed into a smart contract, or software application, on the Polygon blockchain and denominated in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades 1:1 for dollars.  Vance, 39, is the first millennial nominated to a major-party ticket, The New York Times noted, calling the pick a wager that he ""will bring fresh energy to the Republican ticket."" He is also a staunch cryptocurrency supporter.  Trump announced his selection Monday, two days after the former president's chances of victory reached the previous record of 70% when he survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.  That harrowing incident turned into a win for the candidate, as iconic imagery of a bloodied but unbowed Trump circulated on the internet following a fortnight when the national conversation focused on the senescence of his opponent, incumbent President Joe Biden.  A total of $262 million has been staked on Polymarket's presidential election contract, a record for crypto-based prediction markets, if not all prediction markets. The platform, founded four years ago, is riding high on enthusiasm for election betting, despite being closed off to the U.S. under a regulatory settlement.  PredictIt, an older election betting site that operates in the U.S. under a limited regulatory exemption and settles bets in old-fashioned greenbacks, has shown a similar trend. ""Yes"" shares for Trump there climbed to 69 cents from 60 cents before the Pennsylvania shooting.  In prediction markets, traders bet on the verifiable outcome of real-world events within defined time frames. Wagers can be about anything from the weather to elections to sporting events to celebrity romances.  Detractors call prediction markets a form of gambling, but proponents argue they have positive spillover effects for the public. The people making predictions are putting money on the line, so they are strongly incentivized to do meticulous research and express their honest opinions, making them arguably more reliable forecasters than pollsters or pundits.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MATIC | REGULATION | TRADING,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/16/trump-odds-on-polymarket-hit-another-all-time-high-after-vance-vp-pick,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba4f1d8d9d2bd20e6a07cf87445843dba4f0e82b-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31071963,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629981,1721142004,Dogecoin Set For Heightened Downtrend After A Rejection At $0.1293,"Popular meme coin, Dogecoin, recently faced a rejection at a significant resistance level of $0.1293. This setback has led the crypto asset to start a fresh downward move towards its previous low of $0.0914. Since DOGE failed to break past the $0.1293 barrier, this has led to speculations among market participants about the next move of the digital asset. In this article, we will examine the post-rejection price actions of DOGE with the help of technical indicators to determine what this rejection could mean for the crypto asset in the near future. DOGE’s price is currently trading at around $0.121 and is up by 1.85% with a market capitalization of over $17 billion and a trading volume of over $1 billion as of the time of writing. In the last 24 hours, its market cap and trading volume have increased by 1.83% and 73.09% respectively. Recent Market Performance: Analyzing DOGE’s Price Action Currently, the price of Dogecoin on the 4-hour chart is trading below the bearish trendline and has dropped a bearish momentum after the rejection at $0.129 above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Based on these current price actions, the digital asset may be poised to maintain its bearish sentiment and could potentially extend its bearish move toward the $0.1144 support level. The formation of the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator also suggests a potential bearish continuation for the crypto asset as the signal line has crossed below the SMA of the indicator in the overbought zone attempting to move out of this zone. On the 1-day chart, the price of DOGE is dropping rapidly after failing to break above the $0.129 and the 1-day bearish trendline. It can be observed that the crypto asset is still trading below the 100-day SMA and is currently attempting a bearish move toward the $0.114 support level with a strong bearish momentum. Finally, it can observed that the signal line and the SMA are attempting to move out of the oversold zone. However, this may just be on a short-term note as prices might begin to drop again thereby signaling more bearishness for DOGE. Potential Support Levels: Where Could Dogecoin Find Stability? As of right now, Dogecoin is attempting a bearish move toward the $0.1144 support mark. If the crypto asset breaks below this level, it will continue to move downward toward the $0.0914 support level. A break below this level may trigger more losses for DOGE to test the $0.0745 level and other lower levels. However, if the price of DOGE reaches the $0.1144 support level and experiences a rejection, it will begin to ascend toward the $0.129 resistance level. The crypto asset may pose a further climb toward the $0.1491 resistance level and other higher levels if there is a breach above the $0.129 resistance level.

Despite being hit by a sniper's bullet during his speech, Trump quickly stood up with Secret Service assistance, raised his fist, and showed the crowd that he was okay, demonstrating resolve and bravery. This genuine display during a terrifying moment, immortalized in an iconic photo, may have made the future outcome of the election more predictable.  General sentiment suggests Trump is now a clear favorite to win the presidency in November, as displayed by the crypto market's immediate price action following the news. Trump has publicly declared his support for cryptocurrencies, exemplified by his campaign's acceptance of cryptocurrency donations. His running mate, JD Vance, shares a similar stance, openly advocating for digital assets and personally having an investment in Bitcoin.  One of the unique features of digital asset markets is that, unlike traditional capital markets, crypto trades 24/7. This allows investors to see market-moving events get priced in real-time. Within minutes of this weekend’s news breaking, on a Saturday night when most markets around the world were closed, the CoinDesk 20 Index gapped higher by 2%, after more than six hours of sideways trading within a tight 50 basis point range.  The market quickly and efficiently began pricing in a pro-crypto administration, making it no surprise that the crypto market rallied in the immediate aftermath. In the days since, the CoinDesk 20 Index is up nearly 10%, reversing a month-long downward trend.  As more traditional investors start to focus on the digital asset class, it is important to note that there is a confluence of fundamental events pointing towards higher prices in the months to come. Yesterday, the SEC informed ETH ETF issuers that they can begin trading on July 23rd. Similar to Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen total net inflows of approximately $55 billion so far this year, the ETH ETFs should attract new capital that has never been allocated to the crypto asset class before, a clear bullish indicator for the overall market.  The halving of newly mined Bitcoin in April sharply reduced miner profitability expectations, leading to a temporary decline in the network's hash rate. However, the hash rate has begun to recover as global Bitcoin mining companies acquire new miners set for deployment in the coming months. This increase in mining activity is expected to bolster the hash rate, enhancing the protocol's security and resilience. As a result, this influx of new mining infrastructure could positively impact Bitcoin's price by stabilizing network operations and boosting market confidence.  Finally, the market is beginning to price in a rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this year. A dovish Fed is bullish for risk assets, which includes cryptocurrencies.  The recent market low on July 5th may have signaled the bottom of the current cycle for this secular bull market. Should the next US president prove favorable towards digital assets, it may finally herald a new era of clear regulatory guidelines and widespread adoption of this transformative technology. This convergence of market indicators and regulatory sentiment could provide a foundation for sustained growth and stability in the digital asset space, setting the stage for broader investor confidence and innovation in financial markets.

42407848,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6mC6,1721139419,What Does It Actually Take to Build a Blockchain?,"Each month, it seems, a new blockchain is announced. They come in various forms — L1s, L2s, L3s, Parallel EVMs, and so on. But, at their core, they are all about creating new infrastructure rails for developers to build the app that will finally drive real adoption. Each announcement is often accompanied by a fundraising buzz, with excitement around this latest technical advancement being the key to the future.  Azeem Khan, a CoinDesk Columnist, is a co-founder of Morph, an Ethereum layer 2, and consultant to the UNICEF Crypto Fund.  Yet, the truth is, no one knows which of these ecosystems will ultimately succeed. So, what does it actually take to build a successful ecosystem? If you reverse-engineer one, you’ll find that the concept is quite simple, though perhaps not as easy to implement, as evidenced by massive chains with only 20 daily active users despite their billion-dollar valuations and treasuries.  If you find yourself in a position where you need to build an ecosystem from scratch, it's crucial to understand the essential components. The first necessity is users and liquidity on the chain itself. Without these, there’s no incentive for software developers, or builders, to create products on the infrastructure you’re providing. When a chain with too little liquidity remains online but lacks builders, it becomes what people refer to as a “ghost chain.” Typically, these chains have tokens used purely for speculation or sit in a sort of purgatory with no trading volume, eventually fading into obscurity. If you didn’t already catch it, this is bad.  Attracting these initial users and liquidity is often the biggest challenge that new chains face. Typically, we see massive initial incentive systems designed to lock liquidity on the chain when it goes to mainnet. The problem with these approaches is that they’re not sustainable and often lead to the ""ponzinomics"" we see in many projects. The most effective strategy to overcome this hurdle is partnering with a centralized exchange, as Base has done, or with a decentralized wallet, similar to Linea’s approach, to attract initial users. While not entirely foolproof, having distribution built into your launch is one of the most crucial factors in generating initial activity. At no point did I say this was easy, but if you think about it, it makes sense.  Considering that many of these chains take quite some time to reach mainnet, let’s assume there will be a testnet phase. When done correctly, this phase can be a great way to build initial hype — the key word being ""correctly."" It’s also the time for the chain to get the necessary infrastructure in place, such as RPCs, oracles, indexers, block explorers, multisigs, account abstraction, and so on. The irony of needing infrastructure for infrastructure should not be lost on you. During this phase, developer relations teams can start conversations with builders about all the reasons they should develop on their fancy new chain.  One of the most surefire ways to create hype for your chain is to build anticipation for an “airdrop,” meaning free tokens sent to wallets for completing certain tasks. In the past, this was randomized, leaving users unsure which actions would yield tokens. Nowadays, a points system is often used, where users accrue points by performing tasks, eventually earning a larger share of an airdrop once the chain’s token launches. While this method may evolve — since web3 moves at light speed — it’s currently the norm that every chain must adopt in some fashion. During tokenomics design, portions of the token supply are allocated to the community for this purpose.  The most common scenario is that chains do an excellent job of creating hype through their airdrop, essentially giving away free money. Once the airdrop is over, we often see a real-time price prediction take place. The price typically rises for a while before a large percentage of holders rush to sell, causing the token's value to plummet. Chains that were initially excited about the activity on their platform realize they had merely attracted on-chain mercenaries looking for free money. This is usually when these chains begin to take ecosystem building more seriously — often too late. Over the next few years, we’ll likely see many of these chains become ghost chains.  Read more: Azeem Khan - Decentralized Science: A Better Way to Fund and Grow Breakthrough Ideas  Let’s assume that everything has gone well so far. The chain successfully built hype, attracted initial users, and locked liquidity on the chain. What’s next for attracting builders? The reality is that builders, especially the best ones, have hundreds of options these days. In the past, having a grants program was enough to attract them, but even those have merely created mercenaries. This is where the majority of chains currently stand. But what if there was another way? What if we actually took the time to empower builders?  The least employed tactic in the ecosystem thus far is taking builders more seriously. At the end of the day, these builders are new startups seeking the same resources any startup founder would need. However, chains often consider themselves the stars of the show, treating builders as disposable until it’s too late.  It doesn’t have to be this way, though. If chains started to compile their resources to allow builders to focus on what they do best — while providing support for building decks, pitching to investors, creating tokenomics, getting listed on exchanges, and more — we’d likely see that chain become an actual superstar.  If a chain is nothing without its builders, why aren’t more chains rushing to create stars out of the builders who believe in them? A handful of success stories alone would attract builders from other chains, seeking the same support to create successful startups. If these chains don’t take this approach, they will soon realize that just because you build it does not mean they will come.

31068671,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629994,1721136610,Solana’s Popcat Nears $1 Billion Market Cap After Hitting ATH,"Popcat has emerged from the convergence of internet memes and cryptocurrency. The meme coin depicts a playful feline, and it serves as inspiration for this digital asset, which has captured the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts as it tallies a new milestone. Related Reading: Render (RNDR) Attracts Big Investors: $1 Million+ Whale Moves On The Rise Popcat Scales The Crypto Food Chain Popcat has been showing a big deal of resilience since it made a foray into the memecoin space in 2020. Fast forward four years, the token tallied an incredible 180% growth in value in 30 days. The coin achieved an all-time high of $0.7542 in 24 hours, up roughly 30%. This latest achievement puts the memecoin at the top of the cryptocurrency hierarchy. Popcat’s $700 million market capitalisation and 979,978,694 token supply makes it one of the top 100 cryptocurrencies to date. 🚨 NEW: Solana memecoin $POPCAT breaks $700 million Market Cap, a new all-time high. pic.twitter.com/kA1wkXsmKS — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 15, 2024 Popcat’s quick ascent may be attributable to internal and external factors. The “popcat” meme’s appeal provided a foundation for community growth and virality. Investors felt nostalgia and camaraderie from the token’s connection to a big internet sensation, resulting in a loyal following. Second, the speculative character of the cryptocurrency market contributed significantly to Popcat’s success. Investors were enticed to many other meme-inspired tokens because of the prospect for rapid profits and the exhilaration of partaking in a high-risk, high-reward investment. The psychology of fear of missing out (FOMO) definitely contributed to the Popcat frenzy, as many rushed to take advantage of the perceived opportunity for massive rewards. Moreover, the flood of fresh investors joining the crypto market—especially those drawn in by the prospect of fast wealth—created demand for Popcat and other tokens. Both seasoned and novice investors may easily participate in the speculative frenzy due to the relatively low entrance barrier and the availability of crypto exchanges. Popcat’s expansion has been rather remarkable, but purchasers should use caution even so. The bitcoin market is erratic most of the time, hence meme-based currencies are particularly vulnerable to rapid price swings. These goods are intrinsically dangerous as they rely on speculation and lack actual value, hence investors should be ready to lose a lot of money. Memecoin’s Value At A Glance Popcat’s value rose by 16.4341% during the past 24 hours as of July 16, 2024. Perceptive investors will see a drop, nonetheless, within the last 30-day period. Therefore, the choice to make Popcat investments will rely on whether such an investment fits your individual risk tolerance and trading objectives. Related Reading: Big Filecoin Rally Ahead: Analyst Predicts 4,000% ‘Uphill Run’ Financial experts have sought to navigate the murky waters of cryptocurrency prediction, with some, such as Coindataflow, claiming that the average value of Popcat might surge to $1.63 by the end of the year. Looking ahead in the coming months or years, Popcat’s projections show that the digital currency might reach $3.52. Reduced liquidity can cause significant price volatility and make it difficult to execute trades at targeted price levels, adding to the investment’s inherent risks.

42407859,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6mmT,1721134890,"Meme Coins Outperform BTC, ETH and SOL as Traders Rotate Holdings","The meme coin sector rose by 12% on Tuesday, outperforming crypto majors, while the CoinDesk 20 Index is up by 2.3% in the same period.  Meme coins have historically performed well when BTC, ETH and SOL are trading in a range near local highs.  Lower liquidity trading pairs mean that meme coins experience exaggerated peaks and troughs compared to crypto majors.  The $53 billion meme coin sector rose by more than 12% on Tuesday with the likes of pepe {{PEPE}} and dogwifhat {{WIF}} surging by 22% and 25% respectively, data from CoinGecko shows.  The rally comes after bitcoin {{BTC}} recovered to a one-month high of $65,000 before retreating to $63,000. The continued strong performance of meme coins suggests that traders are taking profits in higher market cap assets like BTC and ETH and diversifying those profits to more speculative bets.  The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the performance of large-cap tokens, has been up by 2.3% over the past 24 hours.  Several meme coins based on American politics have been issued after presidential candidate Donald Trump was injured from a shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. The likes of America Coin (USA) and Super Trump (STRUMP) are up by 204% and 43% since the shooting.  Due to varying levels of liquidity, meme coins historically perform well during periods where BTC and ETH are rangebound near local highs and perform poorly when the wider market is tumbling. Dogwifhat, for example, rose by more than 60% in May, while BTC traded between $66,000 and $69,000.  WIF then lost 60% of its value over the course of the subsequent 30 days following a market plunge that saw BTC fall by 21% during the same time frame.  BTC's current market depth - a measure of liquidity - on Binance is between $14.8 million and $11.2 million, within 2% of the current level. However, WIF's market depth is between just $1.4 million and $1 million, meaning that a cascade of liquidations and market orders has the potential to shift meme coins like WIF much further than larger tokens such as BTC and ETH.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/07/16/meme-coins-outperform-btc-eth-and-sol-as-traders-rotate-holdings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d926ee9442131cd638550762d158c8b43fe1132-2684x1510.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407852,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6mM1,1721134800,"Polygon's New ZK Proving System, 'Plonky3,' Comes as Open-Source Toolkit","Polygon Labs, the main developer firm behind the layer-2 blockchain Polygon, released on Tuesday the latest version of its zero-knowledge proving system, “Plonky3” – designed to be more flexible than the previous model.  A proving system is at the heart of zero-knowledge rollups, and a crucial component in the cryptographic security of distributed networks with multiple layers. It is the piece of technology responsible for creating proofs that summarize off-chain transactions, so the information can then be fed back to a base blockchain, such as Ethereum. The system ensures “that a transaction was correctly executed or that a blockchain’s state has been updated properly,” according to a press release.  Polygon Plonky3 is now available as open-source software under the popular MIT and Apache licenses, the company said.  The company's previous proving system, Plonky2, was introduced in 2022 as “a single proving system focused on lightning-fast recursion by optimizing for hardware,” Polygon wrote in the press release, whereas Polygon Plonky3 is an ""open-source toolkit that empowers ZK developers to build their own"" virtual machines based on ZK cryptography.  When Polygon released Plonky2 in 2022, the project's developers claimed that it was 100 times faster than existing alternatives at the time.  “Plonky2 partly had some performance issues, and partly didn't quite have the generality that we needed,” said Daniel Lubarov, a co-founder at Polygon, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We see it as more part of the future direction of Polygon technology.”  Polygon and ZK cryptography  “The proving system is the underlying thing that kind of allows us to do that [proving] efficiently and sort of within a practical level of performance,” Brendan Farmer, a co-founder at Polygon, added in an interview.  Polygon has fully embraced zero-knowledge technology, seen as one of the hottest trends in blockchain. In 2021, Polygon acquired the Hermez and Mir teams, among the most prominent zero-knowledge cryptography teams at the time, and brought their founders in-house. Farmer and Lubarov co-founded Mir together.  Since then, Polygon was one of the first teams to launch a zero-knowledge rollup in 2023, and acquired a third firm, Toposware, to continue building out its zero-knowledge expertise.  “In the past, we had Plonky2, and we also had a few other separate prover libraries, one by the Miden group and one by the Hermez group within Polygon,” Lubarov told CoinDesk. “Our plan now is to bring it all together under one code base and one framework.”  Read more: Polygon Acquires Zero-Knowledge Cryptography Firm Toposware",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SPONSORED | ZK,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/16/polygons-new-zk-proving-system-plonky3-comes-as-open-source-toolkit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5cddfa3717736f65a600901599216a77f95d77b-2601x1463.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

JPMorgan notes that U.S.-listed bitcoin miners’ share of the global hashrate hit a record 26.6%.  Every miner except Stronghold Digital outperformed bitcoin over this period, the bank said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} mining stocks hit record highs in the first two weeks of this month as both pure-play and high performance computing (HPC) miners gained, JPMorgan said in a research report on Tuesday.  “U.S.-listed miners’ share of the global hashrate reached a record 26.6%,” analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote, adding that this represented an encouraging gain of 2.4% since the end of June and 5.6% since the bitcoin halving.  Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  The total market cap of the 14 bitcoin miners listed in the U.S. that the bank tracks rose 29% since the end of June and now trade at “2.6 times their proportional share of the four-year block reward, the highest level on record,"" they wrote.  This seems to suggest that the market thinks the artificial intelligence and HPC opportunity could offer alternative and more accretive use cases for bitcoin mining sites, the report said.  The network hashrate increased 1% since June but is still about 60 exahashes per second (EH/s) below pre-halving levels, the bank noted.  Miners listed in the U.S. added a total 17 EH/s of capacity in June, to the highest level on record, the bank said. Gains were led by Riot Platforms (RIOT), Bitfarms (BITF) and CleanSpark (CLSK).  The bank notes that every miner except Stronghold Digital (SDIG), which dropped 8%, outperformed bitcoin in this period. Cipher Mining (CIFR) led advancers with a 44% gain.  Broker Bernstein expressed similar positive sentiment about the AI/HPC opportunity in a report last week. It said recent AI deals including Core Scientific’s (CORZ) 12-year agreement with CoreWeave and Coatue Management’s $150 million investment in HUT 8 (HUT) have become key catalysts for the sector.

42407862,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6mt5,1721131260,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Retreats as Mt. Gox Moves $3B of BTC,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin dipped below $63,000 as Mt. Gox selling pressure reared its head again. BTC had tested a return above $65,000 during Asian trading hours before slipping 3% as a wallet associated with Mt. Gox moved nearly $3 billion worth of bitcoin, likely as part of its creditor repayment plan. The defunct crypto exchange began repaying its debt on July 4, with traders concerned that recipients will immediately dump their coins, dragging BTC's price down. Bitcoin fell to around $62,500 in the mid-European morning before recovering to over $63,500, 1.6% higher than 24 hours before. The broader crypto market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index rose about 1.55%.  Spot ether ETFs could begin trading in the U.S. next Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter told CoinDesk on Monday. SEC officials told one issuer that the regulator had no further comments on the recently submitted S-1 filings and that the final versions needed to be submitted by Wednesday, another source said, adding that the funds could then be listed on exchanges on July 23. Ether saw gains of 7.3% on Monday, outpacing bitcoin. ETH is sitting at around $3,410 at the time of writing, an increase of 2.2% in the last 24 hours.  Ether ETFs could see inflows of around 30%-35% the level that bitcoin products experienced, according to a research report by Citi. That level gives a range of $4.7 billion to $5.4 billion of net inflows over six months, the report said. The inflows and the beta of ether returns relative to such flows could be lower than the analysis suggests, the bank said. “One reason is that while ETH may offer diversification benefits in the long-term, given its different and more extensive set of use-cases, this is currently not the case,” analysts wrote. They added that investors may split their prospective allocations for crypto investment between bitcoin and ether ETFs, rather than allocate additional funds specifically for ether. The lack of staking in the ETFs could also hamstring inflows.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin's seven-day options skew, which measures the richness of call options relative to puts trading on Deribit, remains negative despite the cryptocurrency's price rebound.  The negative print indicates persistent demand for puts, or downside protection.  Longer duration skews remain above zero, indicating a bullish bias.

31065266,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629992,1721131243,Why Is The Ethereum Price Up Today?,"Ethereum (ETH) is up in the last 24 hours. This is thanks to a recent development suggesting that the Spot Ethereum ETFs are set to launch anytime soon. These funds are expected to positively impact ETH’s price, with the second-largest crypto token poised to reach new highs. Why ETH Is Up Today Ethereum experienced a price surge following Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas’ revelation that the Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading by July 23. Balchunas mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has gotten back to the fund issuers and asked them to submit their final S-1 filings by July 22. Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana Price Could Rise 450% To $840 – Here Are The Drivers The SEC also asked them to request effectiveness on July 22 so they can launch on July 23. Therefore, the Spot Ethereum ETFs should launch by next week, provided there are no “unforeseeable” last-minute issues, as noted by Balchunas. The launch of the Spot Ethereum ETFs is undoubtedly bullish for ETH, giving the amount of new money set to flow into its ecosystem through these funds. Crypto research firm K33 predicted that these Spot Ethereum ETFs could attract as much as $4.8 billion in their first five months of trading. In line with this, crypto analysts predict that Ethereum could record massive gains thanks to these inflows. Crypto analyst Linda recently predicted that the crypto token could rise to as high as $4,000 soon enough. Other analysts, like Altcoin Sherpa, have also predicted that ETH will hit $4,000 soon. Meanwhile, crypto analyst and trader Tyler Durden has provided a more bullish prediction for ETH, stating that the crypto token will rise to $10,000 “just the way the chips have fallen.” The crypto analyst alluded to the Spot Ethereum ETFs as what will spark such a parabolic move for Ethereum. He claimed that institutional investors had put so much effort into ensuring that the Spot Ethereum ETFs were approved and that they would ensure that they made money from these funds while pumping ETH’s price. What The Spot Ethereum ETFs Mean For Altcoins The Spot Ethereum ETFs launch is also expected to spark massive moves for other altcoins and is likely to kickstart the altcoin season. Crypto analyst Crypto Rover advised market participants to prepare accordingly, boldly asserting that altcoin season will start once the Spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading. Related Reading: JPMorgan Says Crypto Liquidations Will End And Bitcoin Bull Market Will Begin, Here’s When From a technical perspective, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto mentioned that altcoins are ready to make major moves to the upside as Bitcoin’s dominance drops. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also stated that the macro short-term correction for altcoins is about to end, meaning that the Spot Ethereum ETFs could be the catalyst that sparks a bullish reversal. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,300, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A breakout would signal a continuation of the broader uptrend, according to Fairlead Strategies.  Crypto traders looking for clues on the next possible move in programmable blockchain Solana's SOL token should closely track the digital asset's months-long triangular price consolidation.  That's the message from analysts at Fairlead Strategies, who see a potential triangle breakout as a catalyst for a renewed price rally.  SOL, the world's fifth-largest market value, nearly doubled to over $200 in the first quarter as spot bitcoin ETF debut in the U.S. galvanized bids for the broader market. Since then, the uptrend has lost steam, with pullbacks supported at around $120 and progressively shallower price recoveries.  That has resulted in a so-called descending triangle pattern, comprising a downward sloping trendline, representing lower highs and a flat trendline, representing a solid support level. The pattern indicates seller dominance; hence, a breakout represents renewed upside momentum.  ""A breakout would mark a bullish continuation of the long-term uptrend, putting secondary resistance near $202. Triangle support is near $132,"" analysts at Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients Monday.  ""We hold a neutral bias until a breakout unfolds,"" analysts added.

31061913,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629948,1721125801,Ark Invest’s Bitcoin Report: Why They Bet Big On BTC’s Recovery,"In their latest analysis, Ark Invest’s crypto specialists Julian Falcioni, David Puell, and Dan White, are presenting a review of the Bitcoin market behavior and prospects, delineating the interplay of various economic, technical, and policy-driven factors that could shape the future of this pioneering digital currency. Bitcoin Validates The Bullish Scenario Since early June, Bitcoin witnessed a significant decline, dropping more than -25%. More critically, on July 7, BTC fell beneath its 200-day moving average—a key technical threshold. According to Ark, the dip below the 200-day moving average was “a crucial bearish signal that often precedes further declines unless a strong recovery ensues.” Ultimately, Bitcoin displayed significant strength in the last few days and Ark was right in that BTC staged a quick recovery above the 200-day EMA, invalidating the bearish prospects. A surprising element in June’s Bitcoin volatility was the aggressive sale of approximately 50,000 Bitcoins by the German government. These assets were seized from the illegal streaming site Movie2K and gradually transferred to various exchanges for sale, starting June 19. “The influx of a large volume of bitcoins during a traditionally low liquidity period, around the July 4th holiday, significantly pressured the price downward,” the report notes. Notably, this selling pressure is now gone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hasn’t Reached Bull Cycle Top Yet, Quant Explains Why Despite these challenges, Bitcoin managed an impressive rally of more than 17% in the last few days. Several indicators supported this reversal, according to Ark. The discrepancy between the decline in Bitcoin’s price and the lesser drop in US ETF balances—17.3 %—suggested that Bitcoin was oversold. “This overselling is likely driven by external shocks rather than intrinsic market movements, pointing towards a mispricing that could correct in the medium term,” the experts explain. Short-term holders, typically a more speculative segment, have been realizing losses as indicated by the sell-side risk ratio. This ratio, calculated by dividing the sum of short-term holder profits and losses realized on-chain by their cost bases, showed more losses than profits, which typically precedes a short-term market correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surges Past $63,000: The Key Reasons June also saw significant activity from Bitcoin miners. “Miner outflows, which often prelude market adjustments, mirrored patterns observed around previous Bitcoin halving events, when the reward for mining a block is halved,” says Ark. Such events historically lead to a decreased supply and potential price increases as market dynamics adjust to the new supply level. On the macroeconomic front, the report notes that the US economic data have been consistently underperforming against expectations, with the Bloomberg US Economic Surprise Index registering the most significant negative deviations in a decade. Yet, the Federal Reserve has maintained a surprisingly hawkish tone, which could influence investor sentiment and financial market stability. Corporate America is not insulated from these challenges. Profit margins, which peaked in 2021, are on a downward trajectory as companies lose pricing power as Ark notes. This squeeze on profits is prompting price cuts across various sectors, further dampening economic outlooks. Regarding equity markets, there has been a notable increase in market capitalization concentration, reaching levels unseen since the Great Depression. “This concentration in larger entities with significant cash reserves could be an early indicator of a shifting economic landscape, which historically sees a breakout in favor of smaller cap stocks,” the report says. At press time, BTC traded at $63,131.

42407853,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6mSd,1721124809,Craig Wright Referred to UK Prosecutors for Consideration of Perjury Charges,"U.K. Judge James Mellor said he would refer Craig Wright to the Crown Prosecution Service to be considered for perjury charges.  Mellor ruled in May that Wright was not the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.  Craig Wright, who claimed to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to be considered for perjury charges for evidence he presented in a case brought by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance.  COPA, a non-profit organization representing bitcoin developers, filed suit against Wright in 2021 for a once-and-for-all ruling that he is not Nakamoto, to prevent him from claiming copyright of the Bitcoin whitepaper and to stop him suing Bitcoin developers while purporting to be Nakamoto. COPA is funded by leading industry figures and companies including Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and crypto exchange Coinbase.  In March, presiding judge James Mellor ruled that Wright was not Nakamoto, and in a May judgment said Wright had lied extensively throughout the case. In a filing today, he said U.K. prosecutors should consider whether Wright should be tried for perjury.  ""I have no doubt that I should refer the relevant papers in this case to the CPS for consideration of whether a prosecution should be commenced against Dr. Wright for his wholescale perjury and forgery of documents and/or whether a warrant for his arrest should be issued and/or whether his extradition should be sought from wherever he now is,"" Mellor wrote in the court document. ""All those matters are to be decided by the CPS.""  Mellor also said evidence from Stefan Matthews, one of Wright's witnesses during the trial, should be referred to the CPS.  ""So far as Mr. Matthews is concerned, it is true, as COPA submitted, that he has been a major player in Dr. Wright’s campaign to establish himself as Satoshi for many years, and in that capacity, has been a significant supporter and purveyor of that lie,"" Mellor said.  Injunctions  Wright has historically used U.K. courts to silence his critics.  Originally from Australia, Wright and his family moved to London in 2015. Within a few years, he began filing lawsuits against Bitcoin developers as well as his critics.  ""Dr Wright’s threats of legal action and his actual legal actions have (predictably) impaired legitimate activities of cryptocurrency development,"" Mellor wrote, referring to the fact that his claim against COBRA led to the Bitcoin White Paper being inaccessible on the bitcoin.org site.  In 2019, Wright filed three libel lawsuits – one against early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver, which was dismissed along with Wright’s subsequent appeal; one against podcaster Peter McCormack, which resulted in Wright beingawarded a single British pound in damages; and one against pseudonymous Bitcoiner Hodlonaut.  Hodlonaut, a Norwegian citizen, took Wright to court in Norway in 2022 to preempt the U.K. defamation suit.Hodlonaut won, with the court ruling that it was fair to call Wright a fraud. Wrightdropped his appeal against that decision after the COPA ruling.  In addition to the libel and defamation suits, Wright used the courts to wreak havoc on bitcoin developers and crypto exchanges.  Mellor also had to decide on whether injunctions are needed to prevent Wright from pursuing further court cases under the guise of being the Bitcoin developer, as requested by COPA.  He granted one that would prevent Wright or the other claimants from pursuing proceedings in this and other jurisdictions regarding his claim to be Nakamoto and another preventing him from threatening such proceedings.  But he declined to grant injunctions preventing Wright from asserting he is Nakamoto or the author of the Bitcoin whitepaper.  ""Dr. Wright is perfectly capable, once the dust has settled, of ramping up his public pronouncements again,"" Mellor wrote, adding that he would give COPA two years to apply for further injunctive relief if needed to protect the interests of the corporate entities and Bitcoin community they represent.  Costs  In late March, Mellor imposed a worldwide order freezing $7.6 million of Wright’s assets – the approximate amount COPA spent on the trial, which Wright will have to repay – to prevent him from moving them offshore and evading costs.  A U.K. court later ordered a further 1.55 million pounds ($2 million) of his assets frozen in the McCormack case.  COPA sought a payment of 85% of its costs, amounting to almost 6 million pounds in the COPA Claim and 115,000 pounds in a separate claim.  ""I consider that 85% is the appropriate level for the interim payment due to COPA,"" Mellor said. He also agreed that Coinbase should be paid 85% of its costs.

31059795,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629959,1721122258,"Big Filecoin Rally Ahead: Analyst Predicts 4,000% ‘Uphill Run’","Popular analyst Javon Marks projects a significant 44X increase in Filecoin (FIL), therefore transforming the token from its present value of $4.40 to $190. Related Reading: Render (RNDR) Attracts Big Investors: $1 Million+ Whale Moves On The Rise This daring prognosis that he calls an “uphill run” has attracted the interest of the bitcoin community. Based on careful technical study and a hopeful perspective of the future of the market, this ambitious projection shows a startling 4310% growth. Technical Discovery Sparks Hope Marks’ faith in Filecoin’s promise derives from a recent technological discovery. Marks underlined in his most recent study posted on social networking site X that Filecoin has broken a significant resistance trendᅳa sign usually indicating a positive future. Though first seeming as a tiny technical bounce, Marks sees this breakthrough as a big indicator of long-term bullish momentum. $FIL (Filecoin) may only be preparing here for a more than 44X back to the $190 levels as prices hold well broken out of a once critical resisting trend. As prices hold this breakout, sideways action and pullbacks may only contribute to this >4,310% uphill run. https://t.co/tVPvBKX7mn pic.twitter.com/Vipqp2Xypj — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) July 11, 2024 Breaking this level of resistance is a good indication of continuous optimistic tendencies. Even if we see some sideways trade or slight pullbacks, the long-term view remains absolutely bullish as long as the prices maintain above this prior barrier. Market Mood And Institutional Interest Beyond technical study, Marks notes other general market elements that could support Filecoin’s development. Institutional investors, many of whom value distributed storage solutions, are showing fresh interest in cryptocurrencies generally. Filecoin’s strong technological architecture helps it to profit from this trend. It is impossible to overestimate the growing institutional curiosity in distributed storage solutions, the analyst suggested. The demand for Filecoin’s services will naturally rise as more businesses grasp and use these technologies, therefore increasing the value of the currency. Marks also underlined the generally rising attitude in the bitcoin market. Filecoin stands out among many investors looking for chances with great potential for growth because of its excellent technical basis and market relevance. Present Market Activity And Prices Filecoin fetches for $4.40 at the time of writing, a tiny 1.9% rise over the past trading session. Within a 24-hour range of $4.10 to $4.25, the token’s price has varied very steadily but somewhat higher tendency in the short run. These increases have been seen among changing investor attitude and different market situations. FIL market cap currently at $2.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com With a good trading volume of $180 million over the past 24 hours, Filecoin indicates strong market activity. Reaching as $2.5 billion, its market capitalisation confirmed its prominence in the crypto scene. Optimism Among Variability The analyst counsels investors to approach with cautious optimism even with the positive indications. The natural volatility of the bitcoin market implies that, despite best intentions, forecasts can frequently fall short because of unanticipated market dynamics. While the technicals and market circumstances are positive, investors need to be cautious of the risks, Marks said. Strong signs might be overwhelmed by unexpected changes; the crypto market is famously erratic. Investors have to be aware of these hazards and control their expectations accordingly. Related Reading: Ethereum Seen Hitting $5,000 as German Bitcoin Sell-off Shakes Market A Possible Game Change Strong technical indications and favourable market circumstances help Javon Marks’ study of Filecoin to present a convincing picture of its future. Filecoin’s special position in the distributed storage space might definitely help to open the path for notable expansion as the bitcoin industry develops. Filecoin is under constant observation by both experts and investors, hence the next months will show if this ambitious projection will materialise or if market volatility will once again change the scene.

42407844,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga6m2B,1721121441,Ether Spot ETFs Could See Up to $5.4B of Net Inflows in First 6 Months: Citi,"Ether spot ETFs net inflows are likely to be 30%-35% of bitcoin equivalents, the report said.  Citi said this gives a range of $4.7 billion-$5.4 billion of potential net inflows into ether ETFs over six months.  Flows could underwhelm due to a lack of staking and bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, the bank said.  Spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. could see net inflows at just 30%-35% the levels of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} equivalents, with distribution skewed to the downside, Citi (C) said in a research report last week.  That level gives a range of $4.7 billion to $5.4 billion of net inflows over six months, the report said. Morever, the inflows and the beta of ether returns relative to such flows could be lower than the analysis suggests, the bank said.  Read more: SEC Tells ETH ETF Issuers Fund Can Start Trading Next Tuesday: Sources  “One reason is that while ETH may offer diversification benefits in the long-term, given its different and more extensive set of use-cases, this is currently not the case,” analysts led by Alex Saunders wrote.  Spot ether ETFs are about to become available for trading in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted filings from issuers earlier in the year. They are expected to begin trading next week.  Investors who would likely buy spot ETFs, as opposed to the respective tokens, may view bitcoin and ether as similar enough to split their allocations between the two cryptocurrencies, rather than viewing them as distinct assets, Citi said. That means ether may see flows that had been earmarked for bitcoin ETFs rather than additional allocations.  The bank noted that another reason that flows could disappoint is due to the lack of staking in ether spot ETFs.  Bitcoin also benefits from first-mover advantage, which saw billions of dollars of inflows and strong BTC outperformance prior to ether ETF listing approval in May, the bank said.  Still, it's not all doom and gloom. The timing of spot ether ETF launches may align with an increasingly dovish Federal Reserve which could mean lower interest rates, a stronger equity market and a weaker U.S. dollar, and that is a macroeconomic environment that could be supportive for crypto, the report said.

Bitcoin miners, particularly in the US, are accumulating Bitcoin in anticipation of another potential rally, with Marathon Digital Holdings aiming to significantly increase its hashrate. Technically, Bitcoin’s breakout above a long-term descending trendline suggests further upside potential. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices enjoyed somewhat of a renaissance over the weekend bursting back above the 60k mark and taking out some key technical hurdles in the process. Bitcoin Spot ETF Net Inflow ((USD)) data reveals an inflow of $1.04 billion last week, indicating rising investor confidence and potentially suggesting a short-term increase in Bitcoin's price. Market participants are also hoping that an approval of the ETH ETF may lead to further inflows in the days and weeks ahead as market participants diversify their crypto holdings. Source: TradingView.com The conclusion of the German Government's Bitcoin sales provided some relief, but ongoing uncertainty regarding Mt. Gox repayments might still pose challenges for bullish investors. The attack on US Presidential Candidate Donald Trump further fueled the Bitcoin recovery. Trump has vowed to allow miners to remain active while also confirming that he will ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their digital assets and transact free from Government control. Given the probability of a Trump election rising, it is no surprise that sentiment in the crypto space received a significant boost. Marathon holds 18,536 Bitcoin worth over $1 billion, up 48% from 2023's total of 12,538. Bitcoin miners are also in a race against time and their own competition when it comes to upping Bitcoin mining capacity. Companies such as Marathon and CleanSpark are looking to up their hashrate to improve their mining output. Miners Opt to Accumulate Bitcoin Bitcoin miners in the US are accumulating Bitcoin as market participants eye another rally. There are big names on the list like Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) whose CFO mentioned that Bitcoin is different from other asset classes when it comes down to what to consider. Marathon is targeting a hashrate of 50 (EH/s) by the end of 2024, up from a 31.5 (EH/s). Bitcoin advocate and influencer Michael Saylor returned to the spotlight as Bitcoin began its latest move. The co-founder and the Executive Chairman of business intelligence giant MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has taken to his account on the X platform to comment on the Bitcoin price increase that began on Sunday. A simple message, but clearly Saylor sees more upside ahead for BTC/USD. This isn't the first time Saylor has weighed in on the World's Largest Crypto and it is unlikely to be the last. MicroStrategy has an approximate 226331 Bitcoin with a value at the end of June of around 7.5 billion USD. Technical Analysis BTC/USD From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin has surged above the long-term descending trendline, suggesting further upward potential. However, the rally faces strong resistance just below the crucial 65k level, where both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages (MAs) are positioned. If the MAs reject the price, Bitcoin could retrace to the support levels at 61,750 or 59,300, aligning with the 200-day MA. This would also involve a retest of the trendline, which did not occur after the breakout. Should Bitcoin surpass the 65,000 mark, the next key levels on the upside would be the 70,000 and 71,900 handles.

As a result, PolitiFi tokens closed the week, outperforming most categories in the industry. The remarkable performance earned some crypto whales millions in profits from the MAGA (TRUMP) memecoin. Related Reading: 1,000 Bitcoin On The Move: Satoshi-Era Whale Stirs The Crypto Waters Crypto Whale Profits From TRUMP Memecoin On Sunday, on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain reported that a crypto whale had made millions from a Trump-inspired memecoin. An address deposited all their TRUMP holdings to the crypto exchange BTSE. Per the report, the whale bought 1.08 million TRUMP between November 22 and December 4, 2023. The address acquired the tokens at an average price of $0.5, spending $540,000 for the memecoin. Seemingly, the whale made $8.85 million from the tokens, $8.3 million of which were profits. Per Lookonchain, the wallet was suspected to be owned by renowned crypto trader GCR. However, it was later confirmed the address in question wasn’t related to the crypto trader. Lookonchain also reported another address holding a significant amount of the Trump-inspired memecoin. The second address, also suspected to be linked to the crypto trader, has $6.5 million in unrealized profits from TRUMP. The whale wallet tagged “GCR: Address 1” spent over $700,000 to buy 936,279 TRUMP. The address bought the tokens at an average of $0.75 between December 8, 2023, and January 18, 2024. At the time of the report, the whale’s holdings were worth around $7.23 million. Nonetheless, it hasn’t been confirmed if this address is linked to the renowned crypto trader. PolitiFi And Trump-Inspired Tokens Soar Over the weekend, former US President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt. The Republican Presidential Candidate got shot in the ear during a campaign rally in Butner, Pennsylvania. Following the news, PolitiFi tokens soared over 30%. DeFi creator and analyst Jake Pahor shared that the PolitiFi sector outperformed most categories over the weekend. Pahor cited DeFiLlama data, revealing that PolitiFi tokens rose 36.7% last week. The DeFi analyst also noted that “all categories outperformed Bitcoin over the past 7 days, possibly indicating a shift towards a risk-on environment.” Before the failed Trump assassination attempt, Trump-inspired memecoins saw a pump. The tokens surged after the former US President was announced as a keynote speaker at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference on July 27. TRUMP’s price went from $5.74 to $6.54 after the news. This performance represented a 15% and 39.5% surge in the daily and weekly timeframes. Since then, the biggest Trump-themed memecoin has seen a 35% rise, fueled by the most recent incident. Following the assassination attempt, the token went from the $6.3 price range to the $9.51 mark, increasing by over 50% in twelve hours. On Sunday, the memecoin hovered between the $7.3-$7.9 price range, starting the week trading at $7.47.

One observer said the movement of coins was likely a part of the exchange's creditor reimbursement plan.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} faced renewed selling pressure on Tuesday after blockchain data showed defunct exchange Mt. Gox started moving coins internally for potential repayments to creditors.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value dipped 3% briefly falling below $63,000, after testing the $65,000 mark during the early Asian trading hours, according to CoinDesk.  The decline happened as the wallet associated with Mt. Gox initially moved 0.021 BTC ($1,000) to the blockchain address: 1EoZd1QNCiN9JbnsqvLRDbHKLygAsXHg3V. The small movement, supposedly a transfer test, was followed by a significant movement of 44,527 BTC ($2.84 billion) to an internal wallet, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence.  The movement was likely a part of the repayment plan, according to on-chain sleuth Lookonchain. Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has reportedly confirmed creditor repayments, saying it has received funds and will distribute them over the next two weeks.  Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, went bust in 2014 after it lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoin in a hack. The exchange began repaying its debt on July 4, spurring fears of mass selling by creditors who have waited for reimbursements for a decade.  Bitcoin's drop weighed over the broader market, with ether, the second-largest digital asset by market value, dipping over 2.5% to $3,400.

The U.S.-listed ether ETFs are expected to begin trading next week.  The impending debut of U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETF) tied to ether's {{ETH}} spot price has investors scrambling to the options market to hedge or protect existing market positions from price swings.  Implied volatility (IV), or options-derived market expectations for price turbulence over a specific period, has ticked higher across timeframes, according to data sources Deribit and Kaiko. That's a sign of increased demand for options or derivatives offering protection against price swings. A call protects against price rallies, while a put offers insurance against price slides.  Read more: SEC Tells ETH ETF Issuers Fund Can Start Trading Next Tuesday: Sources  The hedging activity has been more pronounced in short-term contracts, as evidenced by the recent relative richness of implied volatility determined by options contracts expiring on July 19 relative to those expiring on July 26. According to Kaiko, the July 19 expiry IV rose from 53% on Saturday to 62% on Monday, topping the July 26 expiry IV.  ""The increase in IV on the July 19 contract suggests traders are willing to pay more to hedge existing positions and protect against sharp price moves in the short run. This spike in near-term contracts IV indicates a level of uncertainty among traders,"" analysts at Kaiko said in Monday's edition of the newsletter.  Traders also expect increased ether volatility relative to bitcoin. According to data source Amberdata, the spread between Deribit's 30-day ether and bitcoin implied volatility indices (BTC DVOL and ETH DVOL) has consistently averaged around 10% since late May, significantly higher than 5% in the first quarter.  Crypto exchange Bybit and analytics firm BlockScholes made a similar observation in a report shared with CoinDesk on Monday.  ""Key findings indicate that investors are increasingly optimistic about ETH, particularly in anticipation of the imminent launch of the first Ether Spot ETFs in the United States. This optimism is reflected in ETH's sustained volatility premium over BTC, which has persisted amid heightened market activity,"" the report said.  The pick-up in hedging activity in ether is consistent with the uber-bullish expectations from the spot ether ETFs, which are expected to begin trading next Tuesday. According to Gemini, spot ether ETFs will likely draw $5 billion in net inflows in the first six months, boosting ether's market value relative to bitcoin.  Besides, traders, mindful of the ""sell-the-fact"" phenomenon that followed the debut of bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11, might be preparing for similar price volatility in ether.  Traders, however, should note that the present market mood and ether's bullish positioning are significantly more measured than bitcoin in early January, suggesting low odds of a post-debut sell-the-fact pullback.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/16/ether-hedging-activity-picks-up-as-us-etf-debut-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/091e86fa8117f84ef6ac493753d848fc0350d502-7000x4667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31054549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629879,1721113232,"Bitcoin Dominates as Crypto Funds Attract $1.44 Billion in Fresh Capital, Rally To Begin?","Following Bitcoin’s gradual rebound seen last week, the global crypto investment products also appear to have witnessed a notable influx of funds, with a substantial $1.44 billion pouring in over the same period. According to CoinShares, a leading crypto asset management firm, this surge has pushed the year-to-date total to top roughly $17.8 billion, highlighting a growing confidence among investors despite recent market downturns. Related Reading: Institutions Grab Over $5 Billion Bitcoin in a Week: Are They Predicting a Mega Rally? Surge In Crypto Fund Inflows According to the insight shared by CoinShares in its latest report, last week’s activity marked one of the largest net inflows recorded, significantly outpacing the $10.6 billion accumulated during the entire bull run of 2021. This significant increase can be largely attributed to investors taking advantage of recent dips in the prices of many different cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin-centric funds dominated this movement, bringing in about $1.35 billion of that total amount. This indicates investors’ robust appetite for the leading cryptocurrency, which continues to dominate the market despite periodic volatility. Conversely, products betting against Bitcoin (short-BTC Products) saw a reversal in fortune, registering net outflows of $8.6 million—the most significant outflow since April. The shift in holdings indicates a change of heart, which could be due to more favorable market conditions, or it may simply involve strategic portfolio changes for large holders. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, particularly noted: We believe price weakness due to the German Government bitcoin sales and a turnaround in sentiment due to lower than expect CPI in the US prompted investor to add to positions. While the inflow rise was global, US-based funds were by far the largest receiver at $1.3 billion. However, there were also considerable inflows in other parts of the world. For instance, Switzerland saw $36 million, and Hong Kong and Canada collectively added more than $137 million, indicating a universal interest in cryptocurrency investment. Interestingly, Ethereum-based investment products also enjoyed a significant boost, with a $72 million increase in inflows. Butterfill disclosed that this spike is likely “in anticipation of the imminent approval of the spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US.” Gradual Recovery: Bitcoin And Ethereum Market Performance So far, the inflows seen in the crypto market last week appear to be now reflected in Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price, with both assets now seeing noticeable rebounds following their recent correction, which made BTC fall as low as $53,000 levels and Ethereum dropping below $2,900. Related Reading: JPMorgan Says Crypto Liquidations Will End And Bitcoin Bull Market Will Begin, Here’s When Over the past 24 hours alone, Bitcoin has seen quite the surge, increasing by 6.1% in value to reclaim the $63,000 mark.

Furthermore, the push upward was accelerated by multiple viral meme coins on the Solana blockchain reaching billion-dollar market caps during the last year. While the SOL price was affected in the market-wide crash that rocked crypto in the month of June, its bullish momentum has been far from eroded as predictions continue to pour in, expecting the SOL price to beat its 2021 all-time high. Solana Primed For Upward Move A pseudonymous crypto analyst who goes by ‘NoLimit’ on the TradingView website has presented a bullish scenario for the Solana price. This bullishness stems from a number of developments both on the SOL chart and in the general crypto market. Related Reading: Bullish Bitcoin Indicator Which Led To A Reversal Has Returned, Is $70,000 Possible? For the Solana price, the crypto analyst explains that there is a massive cup and handle formation brewing on the chart. This formation is important as it is historically bullish and appeared back in 2021 when the Solana price hit its current all-time high above $250. Furthermore, the crypto analyst also points to the Fibonacci extension, which suggests that the SOL price is headed for a new all-time high. This extension points to SOL climbing to $550 and even as high as $840, which would be a 450% move from its current value. When it comes to market-wide bullishness, the crypto analyst pints to the Spot Ethereum ETFs as being another reason why the Solana price is headed for a new all-time high. The expectation that the Spot Ethereum ETFs will begin trading soon has already begun to propel price, with analysts predicting it will send the ETH price as high as $5,000. SOL Sees Increased Buying Pressure On its own, the Solana cryptocurrency is doing quite well so far. According to data from the on-chain token tracking website Coinmarketcap, the SOL daily trading volume is up more than 13% in the last day to bring its trading volume above $2 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Accumulation: Who’s Been Buying Up All The BTC Dumped By The German Government? Given that the price has been rising in the last day, this suggests that the Solana price is seeing buying pressure, something that is bullish for the coin in the long run. Now, if this buying pressure continues, then the altcoin could be seeing a new all-time high soon. Presently, the SOL price is trending just above $151, enjoying 4.59% gains in the last day. On the weekly and monthly charts, the price is up 7.22% and 5.08%, respectively.

Alexey Perstev, one of the co-founders of Tornado Cash, was sentenced to 64 months in prison in May.  The verdict rattled the decentralized community because it suggested that a coder could be held responsible for everything that happens using that code. Perstev was found guilty because his open-source mixer Tornado cash allowed North Korea’s infamous Lazarus group to launder millions in crypto.  Inspired by a historical revolution  The name CarnationFM: “Broadcast for a liberated future” carries a cultural historical undertone.  It comes from Portugal’s carnation revolution which occurred 50 years ago to end Europe’s longest-lasting dictatorship. The dictatorship was overthrown in a military coup which turned into a popular revolution. The decolonization of territories under Portugal’s control began and a carnation flower emerged as the revolution’s symbol. Civilians celebrated the end of the dictatorship by placing carnations in the muzzles of guns and on the uniforms of soldiers, as almost no shots were fired.  ""The revolution started through the broadcasting of two specific songs through a radio broadcast: One in the evening of the 24rd of April 1974, marking the start, and the second one, twenty past midnight on April the 25th; confirming the action, initiating the revolution through the occupation of strategic points,” said MF, one of the co-creators seeking an acronym for anonymity. “That's why we picked carnation as the name.”  How it works  It’s decentralized because the music is broadcast through swarm, a decentralized data storage solution operating on the Ethereum blockchain.  “Anybody can listen to the music or the song, anybody can download it but only the people that hold a public key can actually see the encrypted message,” MF said.  The methodology publicly available on GitHub requires the key to be sent to the receiver beforehand along with the time the song will play. “It uses a radio as a passage where people can play music and upload music but the music files themselves have an underlying encryption which can hide any message up to 250 kilobytes a minute,” MF said.  What’s next  The creators are open to continue working on the product but are limited by resources, and are seeking support. “We are doing more research on how we can apply similar encryption on sound waves to take it to the next level, the analog way,” MF said. “Theoretically, you can encrypt Morse code allowing you to share even more information without downloading.” They are also exploring applying the same logic for videos which could be uploaded on YouTube or for a television broadcast.

Bitcoin aSOPR Hasn’t Yet Reached Levels Associated With Past Cycle Tops As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is yet to go as high as during the tops of the previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Crushed: $100M In Crypto Shorts See Flush As BTC Breaks $63,000 The “SOPR” refers to a popular on-chain indicator that basically tells us whether cryptocurrency investors are selling their tokens at a profit or loss right now. This metric works by going through the blockchain history of each coin sold to see what price it was transacted at before. If this previous price for any coin was less than the price it’s being sold now, then its sale is leading to profit realization. Similarly, coins of the opposite type would imply loss-taking. The SOPR calculates the ratio between such profits and losses being realized across the network to provide a net situation. When the indicator’s value is greater than 1, the investors are selling their coins at a net profit. On the other hand, values under this mark suggest the dominance of loss realization in the market. In the context of the current discussion, the SOPR itself isn’t of interest here, but rather a modified form called the “aSOPR.” This indicator adjusts the SOPR data to exclude transactions of coins made within an hour of their previous transfers (hence the “adjusted” in the front of the name). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 90-day exponential moving average (EMA) Bitcoin aSOPR over the past few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 90-day EMA Bitcoin aSOPR had observed a rise alongside the rally earlier in the year. This implies that investors had ramped up their profit-taking as the coin’s price surged to a new all-time high (ATH). With the bearish momentum that BTC has been facing since then, though, the indicator has also seen a cooldown. At the peak of the profit realization spree, the indicator had crossed the 1.05 mark, but now it has come down to just 1.01. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Stalls As HODLers Apply Selling Pressure As the quant has highlighted in the chart, the bull run tops in 2017 and 2021 occurred as the indicator approached a value of 1.1. The recent high in the indicator has been significantly below this mark. The peak level seen in the recent rally was similar to the one witnessed during the peak of the April 2019 rally. This recovery surge from the previous cycle had only been a prelude to the real bull run that would come later, so BTC may also see something similar play out this time. BTC Price Bitcoin has enjoyed a rally of around 5% in the past 24 hours, taking its price back above the $63,000 level.

At the same time, another meme coin that has significantly increased is Floki Inu (FLOKI), named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, recording a 418% increase over the same period. Similarly, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a 67% increase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Crushed: $100M In Crypto Shorts See Flush As BTC Breaks $63,000 While meme coins dominate the spotlight, the report notes that several tokens outside the meme coin realm have also showcased remarkable rallies, surpassing Bitcoin’s performance. ETH, the token of the Ethereum network, is up 51% and is poised for potential gains after the expected full approval of the spot Ethereum ETF market, similar to Bitcoin, anticipated to be traded in the coming weeks. Binance Coin (BNB), issued by the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has also surged 81%, outperforming BTC’s price action despite recent regulatory and legal challenges faced by billionaire former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who is currently serving a 6-month sentence following a plea deal with US authorities in 2023. Meme Coin Bonanza While WIF has become the star performer with a 1,306% increase, its market cap has also made a notable recovery in recent months after losing a high of almost $4 billion to currently reach a market cap of $2.1 billion, which has secured Dogwifhat’s 54th place in the top 100 cryptocurrencies on the market. Pepe also follows behind WIF in this key financial metric, reaching a market cap of $5 billion. However, the two are far behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and SHIB’s market cap figures, which currently stand at $17 billion and $10 billion, respectively, being the largest meme coins in the crypto market.

At the time of writing, WIF continues to rally and is trading at $1.899, up over 14% in the last 24 hours. However, the meme coin is trading 60% below its all-time high of $4.83, set in March 2024.

Based on his analysis, the foremost meme coin is ready for a similar price rally, which could happen soon enough. Dogecoin Repeating Chart 2021 Pattern Trader Tardigrade mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin is repeating the same chart pattern from 2021. He noted that the meme coin was “ready to go” and suggested that Dogecoin’s price rally would begin once the bull run returns into full gear. Dogecoin made an incredible run of over 28,000% in 2021, meaning that such an impressive price rally might be on the horizon again for the foremost meme coin. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Gear Up For Recovery – Can Spot ETFs Push Price To New Highs? Crypto analyst Javon Marks had previously predicted that Dogecoin would make a better run than it did in the 2021 bull run. He made this prediction because the meme coin has always surpassed its previous run in every subsequent bull run. Based on this, Marks predicted that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $17 in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also once predicted that Dogecoin could rise to double digits in this market cycle. He made this prediction while noting that the meme coin looked to be mirroring its 2021 pattern. He added that this could be a “massive parabolic bull run” for Dogecoin if that were the case. These crypto analysts form a long list of persons who have made bullish predictions for Dogecoin. Although not as bullish as Marks and Matinez, someone like crypto analyst Kevin (formerly OG Yomi) has predicted that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $3 in this bull run. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa also predicted that Dogecoin will eventually rise to $1in this market cycle. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Andrew Kang made a bullish case for Dogecoin heading into the latter parts of the bull run. He stated that meme coins account for most of the altcoins that will make new highs by year-end or the beginning of 2025. DOGE Ready For A Huge Reboud Trader Tardigrade recently predicted that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $0.14 when it makes this “huge rebound.” He made this prediction while stating that the meme coin has been “playing Wyckoff Accumulation,” meaning that Dogecoin whales have been adding their positions. The crypto added that “spring is here right now,” alluding to the massive bounce that Dogoicoin could make from its current price level. Related Reading: Bullish Bitcoin Indicator Which Led To A Reversal Has Returned, Is $70,000 Possible? Dogecoin was one of the most affected coins following the recent market downtrend.

31040851,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629863,1721088032,Bullish Solana Forecast: Expert Sees SOL Reaching 50% Of ETH’s Market Cap This Cycle,"Solana (SOL), the fifth largest cryptocurrency in the industry, saw a notable resurgence over the weekend, in line with the broader market rally and Bitcoin’s (BTC) rebound towards the $63,000 mark for the first time in over a week. SOL’s price has successfully recovered from the losses of the past few months, surpassing the $150 level and overcoming key resistance walls, coupled with an optimistic statement from Daniel Cheung, co-founder of the hedge fund Syncracy Capital, who believes that SOL is exhibiting similar fractal patterns reminiscent of the third quarter of 2021, potentially leading to explosive gains. More Gains Ahead For SOL In a social media post on Sunday, Cheung expressed his bullish perspective on SOL’s price action as the token closed the past week on a bullish note, also drawing comparisons to the third quarter of 2021, from which SOL’s price began its rise from a low of $27 at the end of July that year, eventually reaching its current all-time high of $259 in November 2021. Cheung also drew parallels to the fourth quarter of 2020, highlighting that in both cases, the most significant returns are just around the corner, suggesting that further price gains are on the cards in the last half of the year, as was the case in 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surges Past $63,000: The Key Reasons Cheung further emphasized that Solana is expected to remain a hub for on-chain activity throughout the rest of this market cycle due to its accessibility to retail investors, making it an appealing asset. The potential introduction of a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF), which is anticipated to have a substantial impact on SOL’s price, coupled with the increasing probability of Trump’s re-election, serves as additional fuel for the Solana ecosystem, Syncracy Capital’s co-founder stated. Solana Market Cap Projection In an interesting observation, Daniel Cheung also stated that he believes the Solana ecosystem can ” likely” reach 50% of Ethereum’s market capitalization this cycle as optimism around the blockchain grows. Currently, Solana boasts a market cap of $71 billion, significantly lower than Ethereum’s $403 billion. Still, according to Cheung’s analysis, if SOL were to reach 50% of Ethereum’s market cap, its market capitalization would reach a staggering $280 billion, triggering an exponential rise in SOL’s price and pushing it to new all-time highs.

Nonetheless, Solana is trading at $152 at the time of writing, up over 6% in the 24-hour time frame and a significant 438% year-to-date.
