42383980,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoX5,1593031297,Market Wrap: A Sea of Red Across Markets as Bitcoin Drops to $9.2K,"Bitcoin started the week with a bullish run, but it has now given back all of those gains.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $9,296 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping 3.5% over the previous 24 hours.      At 00:00 UTC on Wednesday (8:00 p.m. Tuesday ET), bitcoin was changing hands around $9,624 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. Price remained steady until 07:00 UTC (3 a.m. ET) when heavy sell volume sent bitcoin to as low as $9,195. Bitcoin’s price is well below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, which is a bearish signal for market technicians.      Bearish sentiment is affecting all markets today as investors appear to be de-risking, selling liquid assets for the safety of instruments like cash, said Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at liquidity provider Blockfills. “Looks a little risk-offish on all risk assets across the board,”      Read More: Miners Are Sending Bitcoins to Exchanges Again – And That May Be Bearish      Indeed, major stock indices are all in the red Wednesday. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 of publicly traded companies ended the day flat, down 0.07%. Concern about increased coronavirus infection rates in Japan led to some selling pressure. In Europe, the FTSE 100 index dropped 3.1% Wednesday. The prospect of U.S. tariffs on U.K., French, Spanish and German goods dragged the index lower.      The U.S. S&P 500 stock index lost 2.6%. The round of stock selling has been attributed to concerns of the coronavirus pandemic's resurgence in some states.      June hasn’t exactly been a winner for bitcoin so far, but it’s not like stocks were hot either.      As bitcoin dropped Wednesday, traders with long positions on Seychelles-based derivatives exchange BitMEX were forced to liquidate. A spike of over $19 million in total liquidations occurred at 10:00 UTC (6 a.m. ET), exacerbating bitcoin’s price fall. Over the past 24 hours, total liquidations on BitMEX heavily skewed towards the red, with $33 million in sell liquidations versus a mere $406,000 in buy liquidations.      Liquidations on BitMEX are the equivalent of margin calls on conventional exchanges. A “buy liquidation” on a bitcoin contract is when a losing short position is forced to close, requiring purchases of bitcoin. When a “sell liquidation” occurs, those long bitcoin are forced to sell.      “It looks like someone was liquidating positions ahead of the Friday, June 26 option expiration - lifting hedges above $10,000-$11,000 as this is where the heavy portion of strikes lie,” said David Lifchitz, managing partner of ExoAlpha, a crypto quantitative trading firm.      In fact, strikes do favor bitcoin prices over $9,900, according to Skew data, as options traders appear to be making moonshot bets on the world’s oldest cryptocurrency skyrocketing.      The promising growth of the crypto options market is giving traders other alternatives than spot, as that market is closing in on $2 billion in open interest.      Thus, traders can play bitcoin’s volatility through options without having to take on a spot position. “I believe crypto is still somewhat correlated to risk assets and there hasn’t been a ton of overwhelming buy side demand in crypto lately,” Blockfills’ Van Huis said.      Read More: FTX Is Building Lots of Sophisticated Markets Few Traders Use    USDC/USDT trading on DEXes    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Wednesday, trading around $233 and dipping 4% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Trading of the U.S. dollar coin-tether (USDC/USDT) pair on Ethereum’s decentralized exchanges, or DEXes, jumped in June, according to data from Dune Analytics. For the week of June 8, USDC/USDT trading volume was a paltry $3.5 million. The next week, June 15, that number climbed to $131 million in volume.      Speculation on the lender Compound’s token COMP and the arbitrage opportunities surrounding it is the reason for the increase and in USDC/USDT on DEXes, said Peter Chen, a quantitative trader for Hong Kong-based OneBit Quant. “I believe the market was driven up previously with the FOMO on COMP and it was over-hyped.”      Read More: Compound’s COMP Token More Than Doubles in Price Amid DeFi Mania      “However, the market didn’t have enough solid support after the COMP frenzy has dropped,” Chen added. Indeed, this past week's USDC/USDT volume subsided to $10 million, which suggests traders are looking at DeFi opportunities but speculation may ebb and flow based on token popularity.

The woman allegedly bought S$3,350 (about $2,400) in bitcoin in late February 2020 using funds the police say came from the proceeds of an online scam. The Straits Times identified the woman as a Singaporean national named “Lange Vivian” and stated Lange was associated with a loan shark named “Boss.”      The charges appear to be the first instance of Singapore enforcing its updated digital currency regulations.

42383981,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoYL,1593024582,How to Spot a Crypto Scam,"You've seen it before: A site that promises instant returns on your small crypto investment.      It looks legitimate with all the happy customer testimonials, FOMO-inducing promises and easy-to-use dashboards that look like so many other financial sites. The language is open, breezy but sometimes, well, odd.      One site, Coindeskminers.com especially piqued our interest because it used a derivative of our brand without our knowledge, much less consent.      ""They say money doesn't grow from the ground, well it does with crypto currencies [sic] because at Coindesk Miners we have assembled a group of world-class engineering, strategic cryptocurrency mining and investment logic growing investments and making profits for both parties,"" the website says. The promise is simple: You submit a little cryptocurrency, as little as $5, and you'll get instant returns. And it implies a nonexistent connection to CoinDesk, the world's premiere crypto news site.      Too bad it's all a scam.      And, sadly, not everyone can tell.      In the past few months, CoinDesk has received multiple messages from users - including some retirees - who have dumped thousands of dollars worth of crypto into these sites. Further, Reddit is full of examples of savvy users being duped by get-rich-quick schemes. The site we're exploring today, Coindeskminers.com - we aren't linking to it but we want you to be aware of the name - is just one of many we've seen over the years.      The trick often runs like an advance fee scam – think the Nigerian prince who wants to give you millions but needs a few thousand dollars to complete the paperwork – with a sad twist.      Because cryptocurrencies cannot be returned (unless the recipient chooses to) and your bank can't step in to prevent a transaction, the scam begins with you losing your ""investment"" instantly. Any money you send to this site is gone. Then, after the scammers show you the amazing profits you've made on your money, they ask for more money to pay for ""fees,"" essentially forcing you to pay up in the hopes of gaining your cash and fake profits back. Then the scammers disappear.      Let's explore the world of scam sites and talk about what you can do to stay safe.    When in doubt, reach out    The first step before using any crypto site is to reach out to a knowledgable third party. This could include posting on a Reddit cryptocurrency forum (where you'll be yelled at) or asking a computer-savvy friend about the site. Further, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out anyone at CoinDesk regarding crypto and crypto scams.      See also: How to Contact CoinDesk’s Editors and Reporters (the Right Way)      In this case, a reader notified us about Coindeskminers in a quick email to our news@coindesk.com email address. This is always a good first step. The reader, who preferred to remain anonymous, wrote:    ""I was contacted on Telegram by some individual asking ... about my bitcoin 'investments' who then went on to shill CoinDeskMiners. The link [they sent] goes to the site being shilled. It has a CoinDesk logo, and the CoinDesk service mark. I presume this is a scam, but if I were a noob I certainly might think this was [a] solicitation of investment by CoinDesk, and because of CoinDesk's well-known brand, I might consider actually investing (if I were that gullible.)""    Coindeskminers was familiar to us. We noticed this scam back in December 2019 and warned our readers in a tweet. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough.      We began checking things out. The first step? A visit to the site itself. This brings up a professional-looking page complete with screenshots, logos, testimonials and login system. And a bastardization of our logo.            We performed a bit of analysis using a tool called a WhoIs lookup and discovered the owners registered the domain name anonymously but originated in Nigeria, a place unfortunately known as a scammer hotbed. That said, we've seen scammers pop up all over the world and, thanks to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, physical location no longer matters.      Further analysis of the host turned up very little. Because servers can be anywhere in the world, this one appeared to be in California and the use of Cloudflare - a service that ensures website accessibility - further clouded the user's location. In short, a dead end.      See also: SEC Claims Brothers Lied About Digital Asset Fund Performance, Used Profits for Personal Use      We then decided to check out some of the images on the site.      The easiest way to tell if a site is legitimate is through a reverse image search. We picked a few images from the site and looked for its original sources using images.google.com. Images purporting to be ""the team in action"" or official office buildings are often stolen from other websites. For example:      This particular image - obviously photoshopped - first appeared on Twitter in November 2019, a month before we noticed this site. It shows a seminar in Singapore and the scammers have sloppily added bold signage to the picture. This is a major red flag.      Another picture purported to show the team working on their product.      This photo is also stolen from Twitter. As you can see, the screens and the images have been clumsily edited.      Finally, we scrolled down to the testimonials. What we found surprised us.      That's right: Harvey Weinstein, disgraced film producer, is apparently a customer of this site but goes under the name of ""Henry alamin [sic]"". At this point, it's abundantly clear that this isn't a real business. A quick chat with the admin clinched it for us.      And thus we can definitely state this is a scam.      Regrettably, not everyone goes into these situations with their guard up. In the always-on chat window on each of these sites, there are customer service reps who offer 4% on a 24-hour deposit of $100 or more or 10% after ""65 minutes.""      What happens in this case is your online balance is updated to reflect your ""profits"" and, in the end, it becomes impossible to withdraw what you're owed. In another example of this scam, a retired man we spoke with described submitting over $10,000 to a mining site like this one and then being harangued on Instagram by the site's administrators. He lost his entire ""investment.""      One Reddit user noted these scams often prey on newbies by associating themselves with organizations or people with nerd credit like Elon Musk, Linus Torvalds and, sadly, CoinDesk.      ""Youtube has been inundated with these lately,"" wrote Reddit user Pythagorean0503. ""Blows my mind that YouTube can immediately police unfriendly comments about various SJW [social justice warrior] topics but have absolutely no idea that these bitcoin scams are being propagated through the algorithm. I saw one for Linus Torvalds and one for Elon Musk lately but luckily did not try to send any money.""    Image is everything    These sites prey on victims who believe cryptocurrencies are a get-rich-quick scheme. Given the countless stories posted about ""bitcoin millionaires,"" it's easy to see why a site like this one, a site that strives for an amateur's vision of legitimacy, could draw someone's attention.      Unfortunately, there are no legitimate get-rich-quick schemes in crypto or in any other corner of the financial world. There are only scams. The ability to turn $100 into $104 in 24 hours, as these sites are claiming, is impossible without running a standard Ponzi scheme and, thanks to the fungibility of bitcoin, most scammers don't have to bother with complex grifts. Instead, they walk a user through the process of buying and sending bitcoin using a service like Coinbase and then abandon them when the trade goes through.      Just because a site looks legitimate doesn't mean it is. Many scams masquerade as legitimate groups or people - as in Coindeskminers - or attach themselves to conversations in Instagram posts offering free bitcoin. Scammers take advantage of users who frequent non-financial social networks like Instagram and Twitter and avoid legitimate forums and message boards. Ultimately, they exploit human greed and naivete.          Whack-a-mole    After a bit of digging, we spotted something quite interesting. Coindeskminers is just one of many sites using the same design and layout. One, bitcoremine.com, is a nearly exact copy of Coindeskminers without Harvey Weinstein.      A quick search for the unusually named user ""Hilda Balduin Bitcoin Magazine"" brought up multiple sites including tradecoinex.com and enbridgetrades.com. All of these have a similar design and a similar back-end interface where you submit your crypto. In this case, the scammers request bitcoin to be sent to the address '12b6fGaJNyKmuXgDn9i5sQp9iNhob2H9U5', which has received $7,777.58 worth from other crypto users – in this case, victims.          What can you do?    If you already sent money to a bitcoin wallet, it is probably gone. Scammers can easily withdraw funds by buying and selling cryptocurrency locally in face-to-face transactions. If you notify your wallet provider – Coinbase, say – sometimes it can attempt to stop the transfers but this rarely, if ever, works.      An ounce of prevention, as they say, is worth a few thousand dollars in scammed bitcoin. Be wary of any site that offers instant profits and amazing interest.

42383979,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoUZ,1593017849,Bitcoin Options Market Faces Record $1 Billion Expiry on Friday,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) derivatives continue to grow despite light spot trading over the past two months. The cryptocurrency’s options market is on its way to a record $1 billion monthly expiry this Friday.      At press time, there are 114,700 option contracts (notional value of over $1 billion) set to expire on June 26 across major exchanges – Deribit, CME, Bakkt, OKEx, LedgerX – according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Options are derivative contracts that give buyers the right but not obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and the put option represents the right to sell. With options, traders can make bullish or bearish bets on contracts at various price levels called strikes that expire in different months.      “This is definitely the largest BTC option expiry by a country mile,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5.      Meanwhile, Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh said that “with big quarterly expiry, you tend to see some pinning and then the market moving post-expiry.”      Option expiries can influence market direction via a process known as “pinning” in which option traders try to move the spot price to avoid sharp losses.      See also: Miners Are Sending Bitcoins to Exchanges Again – And That May Be Bearish      Holders who benefit from higher prices in the underlying asset – put sellers and call buyers – often take long positions in the spot market to raise prices before the expiration date. On the other hand, put buyers and call sellers, who benefit from a drop in the underlying asset, take short positions in the spot market to keep prices under pressure ahead of expiry.      The tug of war often leads to prices being pinned at or near the strike price where a large number of open positions are concentrated. “Depending on where the open interest [open positions] is scattered, you could be in the game to pin strikes,” Shah told CoinDesk, and added further that, ""the bulk of distribution of OI [open interest] in general is skewed slightly higher.”      Indeed, open interest is concentrated at $10,000 and $11,000 strike prices. Meanwhile, on the downside, notable open interest buildup is seen at $9,000 strike.      According to Pankaj Balani, CEO and founder of Singapore-based Delta Exchange, traders have sold a good amount of calls around $10,000-$11,000 strikes for the June expiry.      As a result, $10,000 may act as a stiff resistance heading into expiry. If prices begin to rise, call sellers may take short positions in the spot markets in order to keep the cryptocurrency from scaling the $10,000 mark.      At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $9,400, representing a 2.5% decline on the day. The cryptocurrency has traded largely in the range of $9,000 to $10,000 ever since its third reward halving, which took place on May 11.    Post-expiry volatility?    Bitcoin may become vulnerable to violent price moves over the coming months if traders rollover short positions in June contracts to July and September expiry.      A rollover refers to squaring off positions in contracts nearing expiry and replicating the same position in the next-nearest expiry.      As noted earlier, there has been significant call writing (selling) at $10,000 and $11,000 strike prices. Alpha5’s Vishal Shah says there is risk in transporting short positions to July or September expiry as bitcoin options are at a very low level of implied volatility historically.    This is definitely the largest BTC option expiry by a country mile.    The three-month implied volatility is hovering below its lifetime average of 96.6% on an annualized basis, according to data source Skew. A prolonged period of low volatility consolidation, similar to the one seen over the past two months, often paves the way for a big move in either direction.      Thus, if traders rollover short positions, they face risk of an impending rise in volatility that would make options costlier. That, in turn, would lead to more chaotic trading and further rise in volatility.      “If the current options structures [short position] are replicated into July and September expiries, traders would run into a potential situation of having 'sold too low' in terms of volatility. That can bring in all types of complications, and lead to some disorderly behavior if and when the spot picks up directionality,” said Shah.      Volatility has a positive impact on option prices. The higher the volatility (uncertainty), the stronger is the hedging demand for options. Seasoned traders often sell options when volatility is well above its lifetime average and buy options when volatility is too low.    Options expiry a non-event?    Some analysts say bitcoin’s options market is too small to have any meaningful impact on the cryptocurrencies price.      “Options expiry is unlikely to have an influence on price action in comparison to the impact of futures expiry, said Richard Rosenblum, co-founder, and co-head of trading at crypto liquidity provider GSR. “But we expect options volumes to continue growing, options could end up having a bigger impact in the long term.”      Indeed, global option volumes are only 1% of total futures and swap volumes, analysts at cryptocurrency exchange Luno noted in its weekly report. Meanwhile, there is a sizable open interest of 4,605 contracts ($214 million at current price) in CME futures expiring in June, which is yet to be rolled over the July contracts, as noted by Ecoinometrics, a bitcoin analysis company.

Reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage is a market-neutral strategy, wherein a trader takes a sell position in the spot market and a long position in the futures market. This strategy is implemented when futures trade at a notable discount to spot price. For instance, following the March crash, futures were trading at nearly a 4% discount to the spot price.      Back then, traders may have bought futures and sold BTC in the spot market, thereby locking a 4% riskless return. This is because futures converge with the spot price on the day of expiry.      Traders would either square off long futures positions on or before Friday or let them lapse and buy bitcoin in the spot market. That could lead to a two-way business in the spot market.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/24/bitcoin-options-market-faces-record-1-billion-expiry-on-friday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2bbf47d2ee6c85a2306fd5a52299c42283670262-1200x670.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383978,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoVp,1593016698,"Blockchain Bites: BitLicense at 5, Lawsky's Fallacy and Hehmeyer's Pivot","Today marks five years of the BitLicense, the controversial crypto safety rail enacted by New York State's top financial watchdog.      In half a decade only 25 licenses have been doled out, including two to a firm associated with the BitLicense's architect, former head of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Benjamin Lawsky.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      CoinDesk takes a beat to break down what the BitLicense is, how the NYDFS is looking to reform it and why it hasn't caught on as originally hoped.    Top shelf    BitLicense at 5 The NYDFS marked BitLicense's five year anniversary today with an offer of conditional licenses, under which startups can partner with existing licensed entities to begin operations in the Empire State, finalizing guidance on coin listings, as well as signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the State University of New York (SUNY) allowing fledgling prospective licensees to experiment with use cases under the school’s supervision. All this is meant to make it easier for companies to engage with the department and secure licenses. In half a decade, a total of 25 entities have been awarded licenses.      When the BitLicense was pitched by creator Benjamin Lawsky, then the head of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), it was intended to become a model for the rest of the states to rely on. Five years later, the BitLicense has gained little traction. “New York’s BitLicense was usually brought up to illustrate how overzealous a state can be,” said William Haynie, owner of Pelicoin bitcoin ATMs. “It seemed like there was agreement from both sides of the aisle in that no one wanted something that was going to be oppressive to operators in the state of Louisiana.”      Crypto Pivot Hehmeyer Trading + Investments is pivoting to crypto full-time and ceasing its traditional brokerage services, prop trading, commodity pool or trading advisor services. The Chicago-based company, which entered crypto in 2017, will focus on being a market maker and algorithmic trader in the space, rebranding to Hehmeyer in the process. “I hope to see people liberated from the burdens of intermediaries and liberated in their interactions with other people,” founder and CEO Chris Hehmeyer said. “I think it allows people to have more control of their lives and their assets.”      Rules and Regulation The Financial Action Task Force holds its summer plenary meeting Wednesday, covering a gamut of topics around anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF). It’s been close to two years since FATF said it was including virtual assets within its ambit and a year since the final recommendation was made. During the June 2020 plenary, the FATF will be gauging regulatory and industry progress towards the implementation of its AML Recommendations. This comes as lawmakers in Spain are working on amending the nation’s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws in compliance with European Union law, six months after the EU’s deadline, by requiring virtual currency service providers to register with the Bank of Spain.      National Blockchain Initiatives SmartContract, the company behind the Chainlink oracle network, will help China’s state-backed Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN) with sourcing of reliable information about the real world. Meanwhile, Iris Foundation, an “inter-chain” services firm that integrates businesses with the Cosmos network, will assist BSN with interoperability, or allowing different systems to work in conjunction with each other. BSN is a blockchain infrastructure project allowing developers to build blockchain applications.      Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) startup booster, the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), renewed its hunt for interoperable, blockchain-based anti-counterfeiting projects. Officials are offering $800,000 in funding and potential to contract with the government for startups building alternatives to Social Security numbers, e-commerce, and supply chain traceability projects. Finally, Sweden’s Riksbank has looked into the viability of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for its local market and declared mixed results.      Security & Privacy One group of cyber criminals might be behind attacks on five crypto exchanges (including “decentralized” exchanges) dating back to 2018, Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky claimed in a report released on Wednesday. The attacks – perpetrated by an unnamed group likely based in Eastern Europe – follow a particular pattern and may have totaled $200 million in stolen funds over two years, the firm said.      Elsewhere, institutional digital asset technology firm Metaco is partnering with the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center (FSBC) to better inform the security and service design of its infrastructure tech. As Alethea AI, a synthetic media company, is piloting “privacy-preserving face skins,” or digital masks that counter facial recognition algorithms and help users preserve privacy on pre-recorded videos.      Going Public? Billboard Hot 100 artist Ja Rule has inked a deal with Ethereum-based social-money platform Roll. By tokenizing access to their output, social money allows artists to have birth-to-death control over their content, paid in their own currency and let them set monetization rules. For fans, purchasing artist’s social money on Roll allows them to interact with an artistic community in a more familial way. Motivational rapper Lil “Basedgod” B marked the occasion with a new track.      In other news, crypto exchange Bithumb has reportedly started its initial public offering work with Samsung Securities as an underwriter. (The Block) Finally, the publicly listed mining firm Argo has nearly doubled its mining capacity for zcash, possibly to diversify from bitcoin. The firm has added 750 Antminer Z11s that specialize in the Equihash algorithm zcash runs to its existing fleet of 1,000 rigs. Still, Argo’s mining power is focused on bitcoin. In May, the firm had a total of 18,000 mining rigs, 17,000 focused on Bitcoin’s SHA-256 algorithm.      Open Finance Balancer Labs, the maker of an automated portfolio management tool, has begun distribution of its BAL token. Since June 1 liquidity providers for Balancer’s token pools have been earning BAL, but none of those tokens have been distributed. Going forward, earnings will be minted and distributed on a weekly basis. The price of DeFi protocol Balancer’s governance token surged more than 200% on its first trading day. (The Block) Meanwhile, privacy project Beam will hard fork on June 28, adding two features that will lend itself towards supporting DeFi applications. (Decrypt) Finally, SEBA Bank has launched a new bitcoin structured product, the Dual Currency Certificate, that allows investors to earn a 3.23% yield, linked to the BTC/USD exchange rate. (The Block)    Market intel    Mining Outflows Bitcoin outflows from miner wallets have spiked, with the majority of coins finding their way onto cryptocurrency exchanges. The net flow of coins into or out of miner addresses fell to -2,935 BTC on Tuesday to hit the lowest level since June 2019, according to data source Glassnode. To put it another way, miner wallets witnessed the highest outflow of coins for a year. Comparatively, on Monday, only 404 BTC were deposited on exchanges. With the sudden rise in the number of coins available on exchanges for liquidation, the cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to a price crash.      Stuck With the S&P? Since the start of May, bitcoin’s price has rarely strayed outside its $9,000 to $10,000 range. Occasions where it has crossed the $10,000 boundary, or sunk beneath $9,000 have, so far, remained short-lived, as the crypto markets continue to track traditional assets like stocks and gold. While analysts have highlighted inconsistencies in bitcoin’s “digital gold status” and pointed to its weak correlation with the S&P 500, Bitcoin’s price has stayed relatively stable and unaffected by industry-centric developments. “Movements in the S&P 500 will play a major role in BTC price movement so changes in macroeconomic conditions is something we should keep an eye on,” CoinGecko’s Bobby Ong said.      Trillions in Inflows Messari’s Ryan Watkins asked, “What would it look like if institutional investors followed Paul Tudor Jones and allocated a ‘low single-digit percentage’ to bitcoin?” He found it would lead to “hundreds of billions if not trillions $ in inflows.” (Messari)    Opinion    Bitcoin Is Money CoinDesk columnist and partner at Castle Island Ventures Nic Carter challenges the assumptions drawn by two staffers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve in their provocative ""Bitcoin Is Not a New Type of Money"" op-ed. “As someone who has used bitcoin for payments, savings and a means of wealth transfer for the last half decade, this was news to me,” Carter said. “The more useful distinction is not between inherently valuable and worthless monetary goods. It’s between those that the market spontaneously chooses to use for trade, and those that governments coercively impose upon us.”    Podcast    Shale Revolution On the latest episode of The Breakdown, Tracy Shuchart, an oil and commodities expert, looks at how the shale revolution reshaped global energy power and why oil went below $0 earlier this year.

42383977,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoTJ,1593015871,Bitcoin ATM Growth May Be a Boon for Money Launderers,"As the number of bitcoin ATMs soars, one crypto analytics firm suggests they are increasingly being used to sidestep anti-money laundering (AML) controls.      In its Spring report, published earlier this month, analytics company CipherTrace found bitcoin ATMs were frequently used to send funds to ""high-risk exchanges"" – trading platforms the company considers to be known for facilitating criminal activity and money laundering.      ""The percentage of funds sent to high-risk exchanges from U.S. BATMs [bitcoin ATMs] has seen exponential growth, doubling every year since 2017."" the report reads. While approximately 2% of U.S. transactions went to high-risk exchanges in 2017, that number is now knocking at the 8% mark.      While they may somewhat resemble a cash-based machine, a bitcoin ATM enables people to buy and sell bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies directly from an exchange, using bank cards or even hard cash. Crucially, users don't need to have a digital wallet: The machines create them, providing users with printouts of the wallet addresses and private keys.      CipherTrace also highlighted that the vast majority of U.S. bitcoin ATM transactions in 2019, around 88%, sent funds to offshore destinations.      ""[B]itcoin ATMs are likely to be the next major regulatory target,"" the report predicts.      See also: Dutch Authorities Arrest 2 in Million-Euro Crypto Money Laundering Investigation      This coincides with an explosion in the number of new bitcoin ATMs coming to market. Globally, there are roughly 60% more installed now than there were this time last year, according to Coin ATM Radar. The current figure of over 8,300 machines is up from around 5,000 in June 2019.      What's also interesting is the rate of installations has doubled since the start of 2020. While around 1,000 more were added between June and December 2019, in the past six months or so another 2,000 new ATMs have gone online.      Since March alone, more than 1,000 new ATMs have been installed. Around about a 100 more have come online in the last week alone. Roughly 6,200 – two-thirds – of total units are in the U.S., according to Coin ATM Radar.      As recently as Monday, bitcoin ATM operator LibertyX said users would also be able to purchase bitcoin from over 20,000 retail locations across the U.S., including from the 7-Eleven convenience chain.      Bitcoin ATM operators insist they are doing all they can to follow regulations. ATM services in the U.S. must sign up with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money service business and are supposed to keep records of their transactions, follow know-your-customer (KYC) protocols and report anything suspicious to the authorities.      See also: Tezos and Algorand Latest to Integrate Tech for Anti-Money Laundering Compliance      LibertyX co-founder and CEO Chris Yim said customers had to complete various KYC checks on their app before they could use the terminals. The ATMs also require the user provide a wallet address and a verified purchase location before the bitcoin is even sent.      Coinsource, which owns and operates just under 500 such ATMs across the U.S., has also emphasized its commitment to ensuring it has all the right protections in place.      “Compliance is key. Once we learned how important compliance was ... we obviously invested heavily in building our AML and KYC program and then staffing it correctly with experts that could support us in the venture,"" said CEO Sheffield Clark in late 2018.      But there are still some that don't comply. Back in August 2019, a 25-year-old bitcoin trader in Los Angeles pleaded guilty for not registering his bitcoin ATM business with FinCEN and for laundering up to $25 million-worth of funds for criminals, including drug dealers.    Bitcoin ATMs are likely to be the next major regulatory target.    Also last year, police in Spain reported a local criminal gang involved in the international narcotics trade had effectively bypassed European AML controls by laundering cash through two bitcoin ATMs and use the ""clean"" crypto to pay suppliers in Columbia.      Speaking to CoinDesk, Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist at analytics company Elliptic, said the passing of FATF guidance dubbed the ""Travel Rule"" last year means that stronger AML/KYC requirements for crypto businesses are now being implemented around the world.      Elliptic is working with many bitcoin ATM operators who have concerns their terminals are being used for money laundering, Robinson said. And while regulation is gradually being implemented, he still has concerns about how well some of this will apply to bitcoin ATMs.      ""The situation is certainly improving, but it will take time to ensure that these measures are applied globally,"" he said.      See also: Inside Chainalysis’ Multimillion-Dollar Relationship With the US Government      For LibertyX's Yim, bitcoin ATM operators still have to make a choice on how closely they want to protect user privacy while remaining regulatory compliant.      ""What I see is a risk spectrum across competitive markets,"" according to Yim, ""some BTM operators are okay with the potential increased regulatory scrutiny.""      But, he said: ""It's a fine balance between respecting user's privacy and staying proactive on compliance.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ALGO | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/24/bitcoin-atm-growth-may-be-a-boon-for-money-launderers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/250728e2eabdd2dfdf9ba3b254834161657878a2-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383995,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoED,1593014700,"BitLicense at 5: For Startups Regulated Overseas, New York Isn't So Tough","When the BitLicense was introduced in 2015, 15 crypto firms including international players like Hong Kong’s Bitfinex and Swiss company ShapeShift (which operates out of Denver) ceased operations in New York. In 2018, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees called the regulation of crypto in New York “an absurdity.""      But the firms that stuck around have a different story to tell.      The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has approved 25 entities to engage in virtual currency services over the last five years. Of those, four are based in or started operations outside the United States, including: BitFlyer, a San Francisco-based company founded in Japan; Bitstamp, based in Luxembourg; Hong Kong-based Xapo Holdings and the first crypto platform to receive a trust charter, ItBit, which was founded in Singapore and rebranded in 2016 to Paxos.      Bitstamp and Xapo were among the first nine firms to apply for the license along with the U.S.-based Bittrex and MonetaGo back in 2015. Bitstamp and Xapo eventually received accreditation. But last year, Seattle-based Bittrex was denied a license, while New York’s MonetaGo shut down its exchange, and refocused its efforts into developing blockchain technology.    Prior regulation    Tokyo-based BitFlyer was the first international entity to receive a NYDFS BitLicense. At the time of application, it was already regulated by Japan’s Financial Services Agency. BitFlyer’s U.S. Chief Compliance Officer David Zacks told CoinDesk via an email that the application process took almost a year to complete, but the fact that it was already regulated made the application and maintenance process easier for the company.      “We don’t know how many applications NYDFS has under review currently, but the requirements are strict and a lot of newer smaller entities don't have the capital or capability to meet those standards,” Zacks said.      One of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Bitstamp, was granted a BitLicense in 2019, four years after submitting its application. Bitstamp’s Head of U.S. Operations Hunter Merghart wrote in an email that the application processing times can be heavily influenced by how responsive a company is with NYDFS in the information gathering phase, and like BitFlyer, it was already familiar with regulation.      Read more: New York Moves to Lure Crypto Startups as BitLicense Turns Five      “Bitstamp [had] been regulated by the CSSF in Luxembourg for a number of years which set us apart from a number of our competitors and we believe that this, among other factors, helped to show NYDFS how serious Bitstamp takes regulation,” Merghart said.      Merghart added that already being under regulation worked in Bitstamp’s advantage because it understood the types of questions and documentation that was required.      Xapo Holdings, which received its license in 2018, was already conducting operations in Europe at the time, and Xapo (Gibraltar) Limited was regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission.    Trust charters    Of the international entities, Paxos was the first to receive NYDFS accreditation. In May of 2015, it was approved as a trust charter, allowing the company to conduct business in New York as a banking entity organized under banking law. Paxos co-founder and CEO Chad Cascarilla told CoinDesk that it was the first trust charter in the U.S. that was allowed to operate in the crypto and blockchain space.      “We don't require a BitLicense to operate because our supervisor agreement for our trust charter authorizes us to be able to operate in crypto and a variety of other asset classes,” Cascarilla said.      Although Paxos’ application was approved in 2015, Cascarilla said it had been a three-year effort from the first discussions through to the final approval.      “I mean, to give you some sense, our application was 1,000 pages double-sided,” Cascarilla said.    Business in New York    In addition to a gruelling information gathering process, the BitLicense cost Bitstamp up to $100,000 in fees and time spent on the application. But according to Merghart, being able to service clients in New York has helped Bitstamp gain revenue and market share.      Read more: Despite Architect Lawsky’s Hopes, Few States Copied NY Rules      “Obtaining the Bitlicense has also helped build relationships and partnerships with other high quality companies that are entering crypto for the first time but feel more comfortable dealing with regulated entities,” Merghart added.      For BitFlyer too, the license to operate in New York was an opportunity that helped the company expand its global operations. According to Zacks, the firm was willing to make the investment to enter the U.S. market despite the high cost of entry.      “The U.S. is a large market, so it seems like a next step for exchanges who’ve grown internationally, feel confident with their offerings and prepared as an organization to comply with the local regulatory requirements,” Zacks said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/24/bitlicense-at-5-for-startups-regulated-overseas-new-york-isnt-so-tough,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4e78b169e6454fbdc343642d1a4b10256f5f082-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383965,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoBh,1593014464,This Startup Is Forking Compound to Make Hiring More Efficient,"A freelance marketplace for sourcing specialized talent is placing its bets on a token to get the dirty work done.      Braintrust launched out of stealth mode Wednesday, backed by a $6 million seed round featuring True Ventures, Homebrew Ventures, Uprising Ventures, Galaxy Digital, IDEO CoLab, Kindred Ventures and Vy Capital.      The tech startup aims to cut the middleman (think: ZipRecruiter, Indeed) from the employment decision, all using a blockchain – in this case, a fork of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Compound.      “In the current environment of massive economic uncertainty, it is our responsibility to share our expertise in managing a distributed workforce, and help businesses supplement their existing teams and continue to innovate in order to get our economy back on track,” Adam Jackson, co-founder and CEO of Braintrust, said in a phone interview with CoinDesk.      The round was also joined by a handful of notable angel investors: Adobe CPO Scott Belsky, Compound CEO Robert Leshner, former Instagram CTO (and now Novi VP of engineering) James Everingham and TaskRabbit CEO Stacy Brown Philpot.      Braintrust has already sourced hires for firms such as Porsche, Nestle, Blue Cross Blue Shield, TaskRabbit and even NASA. Jackson previously co-founded Doctor On Demand.    Token governance    Employment markets should be two-sided affairs but are often parceled out to third parties, Jackson said. Those parties often fail at sourcing top tech talent and charge large cuts for placing candidates, and are particularly poorly adapted to the strains of an increasingly remote workforce.      Braintrust flips the idea on its head by placing candidates in a pool with employers and creating a structure for interaction based on the Braintrust Token, Jackson said.      The token allows users to set governance parameters for the platform and is paid out based on actions, such as a successful referral.      “It’s not a financial token – it’s not meant to be monetized,” Jackson explained. “You can use it to decide what the rules are, like, ‘Should we let people in with this qualification or should we go to this category?’ or, ‘What fees should we charge clients and talent?’”      Based on Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, Braintrust’s governance model is a variant of Compound’s. Leshner counts himself as an adviser as well as an investor.      “Compound created a basic governance token and voting framework which we hope other teams adopt to accelerate their own development,” Leshner told CoinDesk. “Braintrust is a great example of a team leveraging open source code intelligently.”      Braintrust is not alone in the blockchain-meets-employment market.

42383964,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoCx,1593007753,FTX Is Building Lots of Sophisticated Markets Few Traders Use,"Cryptocurrency exchange FTX has launched eight unique index futures and volatility markets in less than 12 months. But enticing sophisticated traders to use these novel products has proved challenging.      At the time of publication, Antigua and Barbuda-based FTX supports 115 different cryptocurrency futures markets. BitMEX, currently the largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchange by open interest, supports 23. FTX’s unique futures markets, including decentralized finance and “shitcoin” perpetual futures, rank in its top 25 traded markets by 24-hour volume.      Since August 2019, when FTX launched its altcoin index futures, the product strategy for these innovative markets has been to build and launch rapidly to capitalize on trends within cryptocurrency communities. “A lot of these products are really important to launch while popular,” said CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.      The ostensible popularity of these indices’ underlying assets, however, hasn’t always translated into equivalent demand from professional traders to enter the new markets. In fact, these indices report a tiny fraction of the trading volume for FTX’s bitcoin and ether futures markets. A one-week average of daily trading volume for FTX’s top indices shows none of them broke above even $4 million in traded volume.      “Each of these new products are fascinating and potentially very attractive hedging instruments in the future,” said Jeff Dorman, the chief investment officer at Arca. But at present, larger investors may be precluded from “fully utilizing” FTX’s innovative products due to “low liquidity and low underlying AUM per product.”      “With that said, if FTX is able to continue growing its user base and onboards more market makers, liquidity will naturally flow towards these products and funds will follow,” Dorman added.      FTX’s unique futures markets are designed for both retail speculators and professional traders, according to Bankman-Fried. But to some traders, the exchange appears to be primarily designed for professional algorithmic and quantitative traders.      See also: In Banking First, ING Develops FATF-Friendly Protocol for Tracking Crypto Transfers      “FTX is a battlefield for quants,” said Nik Yaremchuk, an independent quantitative bitcoin trader. To Yaremchuk, the exchange’s user interface alone signals that it has “few retail traders.” He added that roughly 90% of all FTX trades are also executed via its application programming interface (API). Traders use an exchange’s API to programmatically enter and exit trades instead of completing the trade manually via an online web interface. According to Bankman-Fried, that number is closer to 75 percent.    Snowball effect    Generating liquidity takes time but can have a snowball effect once a new market gains momentum. One solution to boosting a new market’s liquidity is having other exchanges launch similar markets. This generates interest among their own users and creates opportunities for arbitrage trading. But other exchanges could be “worried about the lack of liquidity” on FTX’s markets, and hence “they don’t launch these products,” said Qiao Wang, an independent bitcoin trader, previously a quantitative trader at Tower Research.      Another obstacle, according to Bankman-Fried, is the difficulties of coordinating the product designers and initial market makers “on really short notice” for these popularity-driven product releases.      See also: Veteran Commodities Trader Chris Hehmeyer Goes All In on Crypto      FTX doesn’t seem worried about the liquidity in its new, eye-catching products. “Over time, more and more liquidity providers start to provide,” said Bankman-Fried. “Because the bulk of maker orders are sent by automated bots, it takes some time for many market making firms to add a new product to their models.” Gradually, more firms will add these markets to their “repertoire” and, thus, provide more liquidity, he told CoinDesk.      According to Yaremchuk, the innovative futures markets on FTX are both great “tools” and “toys” for quantitative traders. But to date, these products aren’t as attractive or useful as they could be due to low liquidity.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/24/ftx-is-building-lots-of-sophisticated-markets-few-traders-use,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1af069afda10ac6b939b279c0a36021f200a4d6-1018x627.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383974,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoOH,1593006594,"Forget Bitcoin’s Volatility, BoA Says Unstable UK Pound Like an Emerging Market Currency","Bitcoin’s often criticized for its volatile and unpredictable nature – now analysts are saying that, and more, about the pound sterling.      In a shock-inducing note to clients on Tuesday, currency analysts at Bank of America (BoA) said sterling had devolved into an emerging market currency in all but name during the four years since the U.K. voted to leave the European Union.      Sterling's movements in the past four years has been ""neurotic at best, unfathomable at worst,"" said lead analyst Kamal Sharma, a notable GBP bear, in a report by the Financial Times.      Sterling's spreads and implied volatility – the future range investors expect GBP to move in – remain far wider than other major world currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, euro or Japanese yen, and resemble something closer to the Mexican peso.      Uncertainty surrounding a future trade deal with the EU, as well as the possibility of negative interests, have also harmed investor sentiment, BoA said.      See also: UK Financial Watchdog Warns Crypto Firms to Register Before End of June      Of course, many say similar, and worse, about bitcoin. In a recent note to investors, JPMorgan said bitcoin might have staying power, but its trading patterns in the last few months showed it was still a ""vehicle of speculation [rather] than a medium of exchange or store of value.""      Goldman Sachs actually advised its clients against buying bitcoin last month. Rejecting the idea it was even its own asset class, analysts said its lack of cash flow and high price volatility made it wholly unsuitable as a long-term investment.      Bitcoin's volatility actually hit an eight-month low earlier this week, though some anticipate an imminent breakout as volatility returns. BTC options volumes on CME have increased markedly recently, with a series of call orders placed in the $11,000 and $13,000 range.      See also: Binance Launching Crypto Exchange in the UK      The BoA's note on sterling comes as 21Shares, a Swiss-based product provider, launched the world's first sterling-denominated crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). In a press release, the company said the new products, set to launch on June 30, would provide U.K. investors with greater and cheaper access to digital assets.      CoinDesk asked 21Shares if a potential downgrade in sterling would impact their ETPs at all, with investors being dissuaded from buying a product that not only tracks a volatile asset, but is priced in another volatile asset too.      Laurent Kssis, 21Shares' managing director, said it wouldn't make much of a difference: U.K. enthusiasm for crypto products has been high, but the market has remained relatively untapped because investors first have to exchange into U.S. dollars, Swiss francs or euros in order to access them, adding additional frictional costs.

42383966,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoFT,1593003686,Where the NY Fed 'Bitcoin Is Not New' Blog Goes Wrong,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass., that focuses on public blockchains. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      Recently, two staffers at the New York branch of the Federal Reserve published a short tract provocatively entitled ""Bitcoin Is Not a New Type of Money."" As someone who has used bitcoin for payments, savings and a means of wealth transfer for the last half decade, this was news to me. I was curious to find out what I had been using this whole time, if not money.      In the article, the authors, Michael Lee and Antoine Martin, first distinguish money versus the mechanism of exchange. No complaints there: Venmo isn’t money, it’s a means of moving money around. Same for SWIFT and Fedwire and PayPal and so on. The dollars circulating within those systems constitute the money. Then the paper gets into more tendentious territory, somewhat brusquely dividing money into “fiat money, asset-backed money, and claim-backed money.”      See also: New York Fed’s ‘Bitcoin Is Just Another Fiat’ Claim Sparks Controversy      Fiat money, they tell us, “corresponds to intrinsically worthless objects that have value based on the belief that they will be accepted in exchange for valued goods and services.”      They explain that Federal Reserve notes suit this definition, as do Rai stones, Ithaca HOURs (a time-based local currency in New York) and Bitcoin. The authors also claim that gold coins sit in the “asset-backed money” category. Assets in this category “derive their value, at least in part, from the assets backing the money.” Gold coins are valuable “because it is possible to melt a coin and find someone who would like to use the metal for another purpose.”      If you are confused at this point, I don’t blame you. The authors seem to mischaracterize not only bitcoin, gold, and Rai stones, but they also rely on an ersatz definition of “fiat money” that is well outside the mainstream.      Let’s start with some pedantry. The authors’ choice of words drives the conclusion that bitcoin is ""just another example of fiat money” with its main contribution being its novel settlement network instead.      Fiat, in Latin, is the third person present subjunctive form of facere (to do or make). As a reminder, the subjunctive is a verbal mood which expresses a desire or a condition. While the subjunctive is explicit in Latin and its romance linguistic descendants, it’s less common in English. It does pop up here and there though. The indicative mood states a plain fact about something — ""You are suffering from gout,"" for instance. This contrasts with the subjunctive which can express a wish – ""May you be cursed with gout."" Another English phrase featuring the subjunctive is ""May the force be with you.""    The authors’ ultimate mistake is to fixate on this distinction between intrinsically worthless monies versus intrinsically valuable ones.    Thus, one of the most famous uses of ""fiat,"" Fiat Lux in Genesis 1.3, translates to Let there be light (the indicative version would read There is light). So in Latin, fiat effectively means “let it be done” or “may it happen.” Later, fiat entered the English lexicon as a noun, denoting a decree or a command. It connotes authority, but much of its modern usage implies a certain weakness in that authority. “To rule by fiat” suggests the ruler has lost the power to persuade and must rely on dictatorial and arbitrary measures to impose their will.      Thus, ""fiat money"" typically refers to money that has value because a government decrees it. Of course, governments cannot simply declare that pieces of paper have value and expect that to stick. In practice, they backstop their currencies with legal tender laws, which elevate a particular currency in commerce, and by creating demand for that currency through the creation of a tax liability (Americans must pay taxes in dollars).      The U.S. encourages the primacy of the dollar by imposing capital gains taxes on the fluctuations of foreign currencies (but not the dollar), and only selling Treasury bonds for dollars and maintaining mutual defense treaties with commodity producers who agree to price their exports in dollars. Some states even try and trap funds within their borders and outlaw currency conversion.      So, adhering to this definition, it’s evident that bitcoin (and gold, and other collectible or commodity-based monies) is not fiat. Much like gold, bitcoin has value because millions of people worldwide find merit in its particular qualities, and so choose to transact with it and hold it as a savings and investment device. There is no state or single authority that guarantees the value of gold or bitcoin. No one is forced to use bitcoin. It is truly non-coercive and opt-in.      See also: Nic Carter - Corporate America Knows the Bailout Is Baked In      And far from being a shortcoming, this lack of backing is a useful quality for monetary assets, because with backing inevitably comes risk. The legitimacy of state regimes is fragile, and sometimes governments decide to plunder their currency to finance spending. With currency, benevolence from a state benefactor is not guaranteed. While some currencies like the dollar are long-lived and relatively stable, many others are highly inflationary or periodically devalued. Just recently, Argentina defaulted for the ninth time, crushing the peso. And due to mismanagement and state indebtedness, Lebanese savers have been effectively expropriated by devaluations this year. This is the flip side of fiat. Guarantees can turn to betrayal in short order.      This point is worth dwelling on because it’s the market-driven nature of bitcoin’s rise that is so remarkable. While many commodities have undergone spontaneous monetizations over time to serve as monetary goods, Bitcoin’s rise has been particularly rapid and well documented. Many monetary goods have been monetized and de-monetized (often as cheaper ways to manufacture them were invented, reducing their scarcity).      The authors’ ultimate mistake is to fixate on this distinction between intrinsically worthless monies versus intrinsically valuable ones. In the final calculus, nothing is intrinsically valuable – not even gold. Value is a function of a third party’s ability to derive utility from something. Monetary goods are useful because of their role in society, as savings instruments, ways to demonstrate wealth, as settlement media in trade, and as units of account. Their societal context is inherent.      It’s a quirk of our nature that we have spontaneously settled on particular types of shells, patterned glass, chemical elements, or even slots on a virtual ledger and elevated them to the status of money. Without being thrust into a very human context of commerce, trade, and wealth storage, they would not have the primacy that they do. The more useful distinction is not between inherently valuable and worthless monetary goods. It’s between those that the market spontaneously chooses to use for trade, and those that governments coercively impose upon us.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | BTG,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/24/where-the-ny-fed-bitcoin-is-not-new-blog-goes-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383975,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zoQn,1593003600,Security Firm Claims One Group Stole $200M in Numerous Exchange Hacks,"One shadowy group of cyber criminals might be behind attacks on various crypto exchanges (including “decentralized” exchanges) dating back to 2018, Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky claimed in a report released on Wednesday.      ""We estimate that the group managed to rake in more than $200 million in two years,"" the ClearSky report says about the cybercriminal collective the report calls CryptoCore. ""We assess with medium level of certainty that the threat actor has links to the East European region, Ukraine, Russia or Romania in particular.""      ClearSky co-founder Boaz Dolev said his firm found at least five exchange hacks over the past two years that followed a particular pattern, though he declined to identify these exchanges on the record.      “They can attack very quickly,” Dolev said of CryptoCore, which he claimed once deployed an attack just 12 hours after registering fresh domain names. “They’re not a big group, maybe three to four people … a small but effective operation.”      So far, ClearSky estimates the cyber criminal group stole $200 million over the past two years. Other firms have called the same group different names, such as “Leery Turtle.”      Or Blatt, ClearSky’s threat intelligence team leader, said he believes the alleged thieves are rogues without military training or support. He described the attacks as “much less sophisticated” than ones conducted by Russian military intelligence officers indicted for influencing American elections while using bitcoin in 2016.      “They are cyber criminals and we know of other similar cybercrime groups,” Blatt said. “In order for such an attack to succeed, usually the [crypto exchange] employees need to be vulnerable to social engineering ... [We] didn’t see this attacker exploiting VPN [virtual private networks], for example, which is something we often see with other groups.""    Human error    Dolev said crypto exchanges that don’t use the same level of security practices as banks are vulnerable to such attacks.      The report details how the hacker group allegedly gained access to several exchange executives’ private email accounts, then used spear-phishing – impersonating a high-ranking employee – “either from the target company itself or from a company that deals with the target,” to acquire information that grants access to crypto wallets.      Nicholas Percoco, head of security at the crypto exchange Kraken, said, “We routinely see attempts through multiple attack vectors, including social engineering attempts,” so his company often shares information with other exchanges targeted by such criminal campaigns.      Ignoring CryptoCore specifically (Kraken was not mentioned in ClearSky's report), Percoco said it is common for such cyber criminals to target several institutions in the same sector, especially the individuals who work at exchanges.      The concept of such a social engineering campaign, as ClearSky described, makes sense to Percoco. This is why Kraken’s security chief said, in addition to technical controls, he focuses on training sessions across the staff because you “can’t patch a human.” Plus, Kraken Security Labs routinely tries to penetrate the exchange system and find vulnerabilities, he said.      “We will take all our employees, executives included, through extensive security training,” Percoco said. “We go very deep about home network security, social network security, even their own personal device security.”      Dolev warned that, especially considering the mass exodus to remote work caused by COVID-19, crypto exchanges face a “higher risk” in 2020. Indeed, Blatt added that CryptoCore appears to be more active since the coronavirus crisis began.      “If you put your money on an exchange, you don’t know if it’s secure or not,” Dovel concluded.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/06/24/security-firm-claims-one-group-stole-200m-in-numerous-exchange-hacks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1153218df1ac2ef7754a666feabbb0e2534d83a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404790,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkZVz,1593002242,First Mover: Bitcoin’s Recent Stability May Come From a Fleeting Correlation With Equities,"Few investors ever get into bitcoin hoping for stability, but over the past eight or so weeks that’s pretty much what they’ve got.      Since the start of May, bitcoin’s price has rarely strayed outside its $9,000 to $10,000 range. Occasions where it has crossed the $10,000 boundary, or sunk beneath $9,000 have, so far, remained short lived.      “Despite a few large fluctuations, bitcoin's price has been surprisingly stable for the past 2 months, rarely leaving the $9k-10k range,” wrote analysts at Glassnode in a newsletter Monday.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The idea bitcoin might be some sort of new, stable asset has been gaining followers; most of the time it’s tied to the idea that bitcoin is a new form of “digital gold.”      The ""Black Thursday"" crash in mid March led all asset classes to move together, temporarily spiking correlations. But some argue that the correlation between gold and bitcoin has stayed particularly strong months after the crash.      “The correlation between gold [and bitcoin] has consistently maintained relatively high levels for several months now, a phenomenon that has not been historically observed,” data provider Coin Metrics said in its June report.      Analysts suggested the market might be treating both bitcoin and gold as safe-haven assets during unprecedented market disruption and volatility.      But not everyone agrees with the digital gold narrative. Most notably, in a note to investors earlier this month, U.S. investment bank JPMorgan said bitcoin still remains a “vehicle of speculation” and rejected the idea it was becoming a new type of macro hedge.      In recent months, the relationship between bitcoin and the stock market has “moved sharply higher,” analysts said. “There is little evidence that bitcoin and others served as a safe haven (i.e., ‘digital gold’) – rather, its value appears to have been highly correlated with risky assets like equities.”      Coin Metrics shows the 90-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 – the world’s leading stock index – remained “very weak” at around 0.17, while that with gold came in at -0.07, a converse relationship that is virtually non-existent.      However, data from CoinDesk indicates that, on a shorter 60-day rolling average, the relationship between the stocks and bitcoin was consistently stronger than that with the precious metal.      As the graph below shows, the correlation between the S&P 500 and bitcoin has floated around 0.30 for most of June.      In contrast, that between gold and bitcoin was in at just over 0.2, having fluctuated between a 0.15 trough and 0.45 peak across June.      “We have seen a relatively steady increase in the S&P 500 index in the past couple of months which correlated with BTC’s trading range-bound around $8,600-$10,000,” said Bobby Ong, co-founder and COO of price aggregator site CoinGecko, in an email.      This connection might help explain why the bitcoin price has stayed relatively stable and unaffected by industry-centric developments.      The halving event in mid-May, which slashed block rewards from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, increased scarcity and was widely expected to drive prices higher – or, at least, increase volatility.      But that didn’t happen. On the contrary, bitcoin's price has stayed flat and volatility fell to an eight-month low, earlier this week.      Bitcoin barely budged 1% on the news PayPal might be rolling out direct sales of cryptocurrency to its more than 325 million users worldwide.      “Movements in the S&P 500 will play a major role in BTC price movement so changes in macroeconomic conditions is something we should keep an eye on,” Ong said. “I think BTC price may correlate with the stock market for the foreseeable future.”      While the 0.30 correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 is still relatively weak, it's still stronger and more consistent than with gold.      Should the stock market rally continue, and bitcoin continue to track it, the original cryptocurrency could even be looking to break out of its established price range.      However, as on Black Thursday, concerns around the global effects of the coronavirus and the ensuing economic turmoil could potentially also send both stocks and bitcoin tumbling once more.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,381 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,699 | 24-Hr Low: $9,338      Trend: Bitcoin is facing selling pressure on Wednesday despite a key indicator eyeing a bullish shift.      The cryptocurrency is trading near $9,400 at press time, a -2.6% decline on the day, having faced rejection at $9,800 on Monday.      However, the 100-day moving average (MA) of bitcoin's price is on track to cross above the 200-day MA in the next 24 hours or so. The resulting bull cross of the two averages would be the first since early April.      The cross comes on the heels of a so-called golden crossover of the 50- and 200-day MAs seen a month ago. Bullish MA crossovers are widely followed and often invite stronger chart driven buyers. So far, however, the cryptocurrency has failed to pick up a strong bid.      On-chain developments, too, have been calling for an extended move higher for some time. For instance, the number of bitcoin ""whales,"" or entities holding at least 1,000 BTC, recently rose to 1,844. That's the highest level since November 2017, suggesting continued buying pressure from wealthy investors.      Even so, bitcoin remains trapped in the narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000. Moreover, the consolidation has gone far too long despite bullish technical and fundamental developments, and the bears may feel emboldened in the absence of quick progress to the higher side.      The immediate support is seen at $9,000, which, if breached, would expose the 200-day MA located at $8,291. On the higher side, $10,000 is still the resistance to beat for the bulls.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Paddy Baker, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/24/first-mover-bitcoins-recent-stability-may-come-from-a-fleeting-correlation-with-equities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5e3a4b38022141c36b6bead1cd4db114730cf94-1500x927.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The net flow of coins into or out of miner addresses fell to -2,935 BTC on Tuesday to hit the lowest level since June 2019, according to data source Glassnode. To put it another way, miner wallets witnessed the highest outflow of coins for a year.      “There has been a big spike in miner outflows overnight, I'm expecting a whole lot of selling, starting real soon,” popular cryptocurrency analyst Cole Garner tweeted, along with a chart from blockchain analysis firm CryptoQuant showing a big spike in the miner outflow around 10:00 UTC on Tuesday.      However, the Miner’s Netflow Volume does not tell us whether coins have been sent to exchanges for liquidation or sold off in an over-the-counter deal.

The total 2,844 BTC that went to exchange platforms was the highest since March 26. That's a major spike: on Monday, only 404 BTC were deposited on exchanges.      With the sudden rise in the number of coins available on exchanges for liquidation, the cryptocurrency looks vulnerable for a notable price drop. Such spikes in miner outflows have preceded price drops in the past, although they don't necessarily mean a drop is on the way.      For example, outflows increased from 380 BTC to 1,824 BTC on Aug. 2, 2019, but the cryptocurrency extended its recovery rally to hit highs above $12,300 on Aug. 6.      It remains to be seen if the latest spike in miner outflows yields a notable price drop or traps bears on the wrong side of the market. Supporting the case for a downside move is the fact that miners have spent less than they mined in the last 24 hours, pushing miners' rolling inventory (MRI) above 100%, according to ByteTree.com.      Miners typically hoard coins when they feel the market lacks strength to absorb their offers.      At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading near $9,350, a 3% drop on the day. Prices are trapped in the range of $9,000 to $10,000 for the fifth straight week.

42404777,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkZJC,1592994637,Argo Buys $500K Worth of Zcash Miners as Bitcoin Revenue Shrivels,"Argo has nearly doubled its mining capacity for zcash, possibly as it looks to diversify from bitcoin.      The publicly listed mining firm has bought 750 Antminer Z11s, which specialize in the Equihash algorithm, for a total of $474,000. The rigs are now already in operation and were working at full capacity, Argo said in a filing at the London Stock Exchange (LSE).      In a statement sent after this article's publication, Argo CEO Peter Wall said his company was ""bullish"" on bitcoin and expects ""all cryptoassets"" to do well over the next six months.      ""Argo saw an opportunity to get high-performing machines at an excellent price with a technology we are familiar with. We jumped on it,"" he said.      Only a handful of coins use the Equihash algorithm and the largest, by far, is zcash. The acquisition means Argo – which listed on the LSE in 2018 – has significantly increased its zcash mining capacity. The new Z11s join the 1,000 rigs the company already owns.      See also: Bitmain Co-Founder Offers Share Buyback at $4B Valuation to End Power Struggle      Argo's mining power is mostly focused on bitcoin. In May, the firm had a total of 18,000 mining rigs, 17,000 focus of which are focused on the SHA-256 algorithm that is primarily used by bitcoin.      But since Argo bought its first lot of Z11 miners in May 2019 – in a bid to salvage its stock price after a $5.3 million pre-tax loss in 2018 – it has become one of the largest zcash miners. The company claimed on its website to make up roughly 3.5% of the network's mining power.      Assuming total hashrate stays the same, the additional 750 miners means Argo could now constitute something like 6% of the Zcash blockchain.      ""[T]he correct strategy is continued investment in mining infrastructure,"" said CEO Peter Wall, in a statement. ""Argo's existing fleet of Z11s have performed extremely well, and we are pleased to add more Equihash mining capacity to our fleet of machines.""      Although Bitmain, the Chinese manufacturer of the Z11, has since released a more powerful Equihash miner, Argo claims that they would still get a better return on investment from the older model – which was released in March 2019.      The company estimates to have fully recouped the $474,000 purchase price in about eight months' time.      See also: Zcash’s First Halving May Solve Its Inflation Problem      Like the rest of the cryptocurrency market, zcash toppled in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. After riding high at $73 in February, the coin promptly slumped to a three-year-low at sub $24 by the middle of March. It has regained much ground over the past three months, trading at around $53 by the start of the week. Zcash had surged to just under $60 at press time, according to CoinDesk data.      As well as increasing zcash prices, it's also possible Argo might be diversifying from bitcoin. Earlier this month, the company reported a $600,000 dip in revenue, in part because a slash in the block reward meant it mined around 60 less bitcoin with the same number of machines.      CryptoCompare's mining profitability calculator shows mining Zcash with a Z11 brought in much greater returns – upwards of $130 each month – compared to bitcoin which, even with the latest S17 rigs, would still mine at a loss of about $90 a month.

42404776,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkZID,1592989213,World's Oldest Central Bank Reviews Possible Digital Currency With Mixed Results,"Sweden's Riksbank has looked into the viability of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for its local market and declared mixed results.      In a 96-page economic review, updated June 18, the world's oldest central bank presents four models for supplying a digital version of the Swedish krona (e-krona) as well as outlining how well the different models would fit its policy goals.      Those goals include fostering a stable store of value and unit of account, being a lender of last resort (LOLR) providing a secure means of payment and settlement and providing tools for preserving financial stability.      Amid that backdrop, the four models under review include a ""centralized e-krona provision without intermediaries,"" ""a centralized model with intermediaries,"" ""decentralized solutions with intermediaries"" and ""a synthetic e-krona.""      ""We have seen that all models would have advantages and disadvantages, but some seem better at fulfilling the current needs of the Swedish payment market than others,"" the review reads.      See also: Fed Paper: Central Bank Digital Currencies Could Replace Commercial Banks – But at a Cost      A centralized e-krona provision without intermediaries would see the bank take responsibility for the whole distribution chain for the e-krona. This scheme, the review says, would mean a wholly new role for Riksbank, similar to how large retail banks operate.      The Riksbank claims that under this model it would illicit substantial costs for staffing and customer support functions for potentially millions of users while simultaneously acting as a competitor to private payment services at the retail level, therefore indirectly creating a market monopoly.      ""Riksbank may end up having too large a footprint in the payment market,"" the review reads. ""It could also be possible to implement a small-scale version of this model where the Riksbank would provide a basic supply of services that could, for instance, be catered to the needs of vulnerable groups.""      The centralized model with intermediaries closely resembles the current Swede financial infrastructure in that it is based on a partnership between the central bank and private service providers where Riksbank maintains its prominent role at the wholesale level of the payment market. However, in this example the bank does not have an operational role in the distribution chain, as mentioned above.      ""Technology is not a decisive factor in this model. Both a conventional account-based and a token-based e-krona are possible. A token-based model is where each digital e-krona is uniquely identifiable and would ""essentially replicate the current cash distribution model but in digital format,"" the review reads. ""The distinction between a token-based or account-based e-krona has no bearing on the potential implications of the e-krona on the monetary system by itself.""      See also: Digital Dollars Give the State Too Much Control Over Money      In a similar way to how the centralized model above operates, in a decentralized setting all intermediaries involving the e-krona would possess a direct contractual relationship with the consumer. ""This setup is simply a decentralized database of all e-kronor in circulation at any given moment, where the Riksbank verifies all transactions before completion.""      The review suggests Riksbank would need to provide a contingency plan if one or several intermediaries were to fail, the bank would then need to be able to provide a large number of customers with e-krona payments.      This differs slightly from the centralized model where Riksbank has no contractual agreement with the consumer and the anti-money-laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) and counter-terrorist-financing (CTF) policies would be the sole responsibility of the intermediaries.      The final model presented in the economic review of CBDCs was the synthetic e-krona. The paper explains that aside from allowing more institutions access to the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems ""the model consists mostly of new legislation that would require banks (and others) to set up segregated accounts.""      This model closely resembles the existing one, where the role of the central bank is to be an actor in the middle of the payment system with the private market acting as a secondary layer serving customers. For the private sector, ""existing payment solutions could continue to operate as today with no need for additional hardware or investment.""      ""What makes the Synthetic e-krona attractive is its limited scale compared to the other models that we have described. It would not involve major investment in infrastructure and the Riksbank could renounce all responsibility for KYC, ALM etc,"" the bank states.      See also: China Will ‘Undoubtedly’ Pursue Digital Yuan, Central Bank Says      The Riksbank concludes that both the centralized and decentralized model featuring intermediaries, as well as the centralized e-krona provision without intermediaries, would incur substantial change and cost. A synthetic digital version of the Swedish krona, the paper says, could prove to be viable but may not even classify as a CBDC.      ""Such a minimalistic approach might not achieve the goals of enhanced competition and resilience to the same extent since it would be quite similar to today’s system,"" the review reads. ""Furthermore, it would not be a direct claim on the Riksbank, and therefore it is not clear if this should really be considered to be a CBDC.""      The central bank added that a lot of the modelling would need to be expanded upon in ""many dimensions"" in future studies.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/24/worlds-oldest-central-bank-reviews-possible-digital-currency-with-mixed-results,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef16ba2b94e04fb8a87bede2698611480378d492-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404780,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkZN8,1592985600,FATF Meets Wednesday to Discuss 'Travel Rule' for Digital Assets,"The Financial Action Task Force holds its summer plenary meeting Wednesday, covering a gamut of topics around anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF).      With cryptocurrency now firmly in the global watchdog’s sights, here’s what to expect from the hearing, which will be the first time a FATF plenary will take place virtually.      It’s been close to two years since FATF said it was including virtual assets within its ambit and a year since the final recommendation was made. During the June 2020 plenary, the FATF will be gauging regulatory and industry progress towards the implementation of its AML Recommendations.      The Travel Rule recommendation, introduced in June 2019 – which requires financial institutions participating in a transaction to exchange relevant beneficiary and originator know-your-customer (KYC) information – will be one of the topics of discussion as the FATF’s 12-month review process reaches its conclusion.      Member states will also have to report back on the measures their jurisdictions have taken to ensure compliance with Recommendations 15 (New Technologies) and 16 (Wire Transfers). Countries will have to demonstrate progress made developing domestic regulatory frameworks to ensure virtual asset service provider (VASP) compliance with the recommendations.      Read more: All Global Crypto Exchanges Must Now Share Customer Data, FATF Rules      “People have been treating this as a sort of deadline,” said Siân Jones, senior partner at XReg Consulting and a former delegate on the FATF Policy Development group. “I think this has been overstated. It is a milestone, but it’s not a hard deadline.”      The 37 FATF member states form a quasi-treaty organization that mutually evaluates progress on digital asset regulation from country to country, and also how the industry has done at creating technical solutions and standards. A number of technical solutions have emerged with some clearly intended to land around the time of the plenary meeting.      ""Since the FATF published its guidance last year, out of the 200+ countries that comprise of the FATF’s member jurisdictions, only around 10% of regulators have published frameworks and legislation fully-aligned with the new guidance,"" said Elsa Madrolle, general manager of International at CoolBitX, a wallet provider that developed the Sygna Bridge solution for the Travel Rule.      Jones said there will likely be an acknowledgement that FATF members such as the U.S., Europe, Switzerland and Singapore have made progress, as has the crypto industry. There may be some notification of areas and jurisdictions where more work is needed – but this all takes place behind closed doors.      In Madrolle's opinion, South Korea, Singapore, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Abu Dhabi and Switzerland deserve to be praised widely for establishing comprehensive regulation around the issuance and use of digital currencies, aligned with FATF requirements.      However, some countries such as Japan or the U.K. have stopped short of implementing specific regulations to encompass the Travel Rule requirement, said Madrolle, while the U.S. has issued regulations encompassing the Travel Rule without enforcing compliance.      In addition, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) greatly complicates the debate of AML measures versus data privacy. ""The two sets of AML guidance issued by FATF and the European Union have yet to be fully aligned, resulting in a patchwork of regulations being devised across the EU with some countries falling behind on timelines,"" said Madrolle.      Read more: In Banking First, ING Develops FATF-Friendly Protocol for Tracking Crypto Transfers      The event, which normally takes place over a whole week in Paris and can attract as many as 800 delegates, has been boiled down to three hours on Wednesday      “Virtual assets are an important item and a number of countries will want to speak on it. That might last ten minutes; it might last half an hour,” Jones said. “But as everything has been truncated, I imagine it will just be a matter of ten or 20 minutes on this topic.”      In fact, the hard work has already been done, Jones said, in the form of a report by the FATF Policy Development Group.      “This report will have been circulated in advance of Wednesday, and there will have been various recommendations,” said Jones. “Countries can take their positions and the business of the plenary will be quite formal.”      The FATF report, once it has been approved by member countries, will be sent on to the G20, which kicked off the process by asking the FATF to look at digital assets back in 2018.      “The report will be published in some form probably a week or two after the plenary meeting,” said Jones. “It’s unlikely to be the full report, I expect there will be some abridged form.”      Read more: Identity Startup Notabene Launches Exchange Tool for FATF Travel Rule Compliance      In addition to the work done by the permanent Policy Development group, an ad hoc Digital Asset Contact Group was formed to monitor progress and liaise with countries and the private sector.      “I think it’s highly likely the Contact Group will be renewed for another 12 months,” said Jones.      The social distancing imperative could have an effect on outcomes and progress regarding the complex work of digital assets, Jones lamented, because there’s less opportunity to have side meetings over coffee. That may mean fewer ways to address issues or broker compromises.      “All the formal stuff at these big international meetings, in a sense, provides the backdrop for many important encounters between delegates and conversations on the margins, during which they can start to iron out problems,” she said.      COVID-19 is likely to feature in some of the upcoming Travel Rule discussions as regulators may need more time in light of the current landscape, said Madrolle.      ""We should see a trend towards harmonization between AML initiatives such as 5AMLD and FATF, possibly through further explanatory guidance notes from one side or the other,"" she said. ""One of the most complicated issues for FATF to tackle during this plenary remains the 'sunrise' issue, where different regulation is devised and implemented at different times around the world.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/24/fatf-meets-wednesday-to-discuss-travel-rule-for-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac70f60172008fbc013a9bed4b2cb4a158dc4fcf-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404771,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkZEH,1592971200,US Homeland Security's Tech Scouts Reissue Call for Blockchain Startups,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) startup booster, the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), renewed its hunt for interoperable, blockchain-based anti-counterfeiting projects at a virtual Industry Day on Tuesday.      SVIP officials offered startups a fresh batch of use cases – an alternative to Social Security numbers; e-commerce, food and natural gas supply chain traceability projects; and an essential worker license inspired by COVID-19 – plus the same $800,000 in funding and potential to contract with the government that they’ve wooed first-time federal partners with in the past.      Coming two years after SVIP first ventured into the realm of distributed technologies and forgeries and four years into the Department's private sector blockchain efforts, the renewed call highlighted the extent to which this lively corner of DHS has courted and funded startups building blockchain solutions for a cabinet department eager to deploy them.      “We are in the business of finding global talent to solve our local problems,” said Anil John, SVIP’s technical director at the event. “We are not in the business of doing science experiments.”      SVIP previously bankrolled Factom, Mavennet, SecureKey, Digital Bazaar and others' respective efforts to build DHS everything from data-securing Border Patrol camera platforms to timber credential mechanisms. Part of the Science and Technology Directorate, the program has handed out millions in funding.      John, who is known as the “Blockchain Guru” of DHS, challenged the virtual event’s 300 participants to pitch deployable tools for the Privacy Office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the three DHS branches posing SVIP’s five new use cases.    Revamping the Social Security number    Though the Silicon Valley Innovation Program often focuses on funding solutions for internal DHS problems, its call on behalf of the DHS Privacy Office offered startups the rare opportunity to create a tool that touches nearly every person in the country: an alternative to the Social Security number (SSN).      “We’re not out there to replace SSN, we are there to create something that people can share back and forth without leaking [personally identifiable information],” said David Linder, the senior director for Privacy Policy and Oversight at DHS.      Such a tool could address one of the most pressing but seemingly insurmountable privacy conundrums in American life. The SSN – the de-facto national identification number and also a gateway to financial services, health care and countless other services – is a highly insecure way of demonstrating one’s identity.      The Privacy Office wants startups to come up with an interoperable alternative that DHS can use internally. Indeed, a 2019 directive mandates that DHS phase the number out.      But Linder told startups their solutions could, and should, keep wider uses in mind.      “We feel like a real solution is this working beyond DHS,” he said. “We dont feel that there's a ton of value” if it's unique to DHS.    Essential Worker Attestation    USCIS officials requested pitches that will let essential DHS workers prove their essential status. They want to make it easier for those still traveling, reporting to offices and doing business as essential workers to show via credentials that they are as essential as they claim.      John used the U.S.-Canadian border, currently closed to everything but essential travel and trade, as an example of why government agencies needed such an attestation system.      “Both their border services agencies and ours are having challenges at the border when someone shows up and says ‘I am an essential person conducting trade that is allowed by treaty or permission,’” he said. “How do you sort of attest that?”      But John and the USCIS officials were quick to distinguish between this essential worker license and the COVID-19 immunity passports that some governments and technologists have considered developing.      Read more: COVID-19 ‘Immunity Passport’ Unites 60 Firms on Self-Sovereign ID Project      “We’re not looking for immunity certificates, immunity passports, COVID credentials,” said John Goodwin of USCIS.      Anil John, the SVIP technical director, said the science simply does not back up going down such a route.      “As COVID-19 is one of those diseases that disproportionately targets vulnerable populations, Black communities, our vulnerable essential workers on the frontlines, we are very concerned given the current lack of science around the immunity passport.”    Supply Chain Tracing    Startups can also pitch SVIP on supply chain traceability projects that address problem points in food safety, e-commerce and natural gas.      Vincent Annunziato, director of CBP’s business transformation division, told attendees that his agency wants to eliminate paper-based supply chains in favor of fully digitized systems that auditors can trust.      “Right now what tends to happen is the outside entities are supplying data often in paper means,” he said. “What’s the easiest thing in the world to doctor? A piece of paper.”      Annunziato said that the governments and industries alike are both moving swiftly to update the way they monitor supply chains. He pointed to Walmart’s efforts tracing leafy greens and the Food and Drug Administration’s ongoing interest in blockchain systems.      If all the disparate parties to a supply chain ported their data into interoperable systems, then he said that companies could see gains in efficiency, and governments could trust the provenance of goods.      “We are interested in the team sport of data,” he said.      Annunziato framed this as a chance to influence a top-down redesign.      “The government is starting to look at reinventing its processes in a way that's never been done before,” he said.    Interoperability    Whether or not the startup proposals rely on blockchain is perhaps less important than their proposed solution’s capacity to work in conjunction with others, said John. He repeatedly cited the need to follow open standards that allow technologies to work cross-platform.      Referencing SVIP’s previous batch of startups, which built interoperable asset trackers and digital identifiers during a recent collaboration event, John warned the prospective newcomers against pitching a “one ring to bind them all infrastructure.”      “What we are looking for is a truly global interoperable and diverse ecosystem of solutions providers who have a baseline of interoperability,” he said.      John said that SVIP will consider proposals from all qualifying startups, regardless of their home country or employees’ nationalities.      “We are the part of the U.S. government that believes that talent does not stop at borders,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/24/us-homeland-securitys-tech-scouts-reissue-call-for-blockchain-startups,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e91679616703f7e72242b17cb1502c4796fec51-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
