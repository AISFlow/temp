35949551,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652204,1731106844,"Dogecoin Price Forecast: Analyst Says Downside Is Minimized As 1M, 3M, And 6M Candles Turn Bullish","As the crypto market rides the bullish wave spurred on by Donald Trump’s win in the United States Presidential elections, the Dogecoin price has emerged as a top performer, gaining over 25% earlier this week. With momentum building toward a potential all-time high, a crypto analyst highlights that Dogecoin’s downside risk has significantly decreased. This positive shift is attributed to the recent bullish trend across the 1-month, 2-month, 3-month, and 6-month candles, which are now turning bullish. Dogecoin Price Outlook Brightens With Long-Term Candles In a recent technical analysis, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) identified as ‘The Coach’ declared that the Dogecoin long-term candles, specifically the 1M, 2M, 3M, and 6M indicators, are all turning bullish. These monthly candles reflect a cryptocurrency’s price performance over an extended period and are often used to gauge larger market trends. Related Reading: This Crypto Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Rise To $75,000, Here’s The Full Prediction In the case of Dogecoin, these long-term candles highlight that the meme coin has recorded consistent price increases, experiencing strong monthly, quarterly, and biannual market performance. Based on the long-term bull candles, The Coach surmised that the downside potential for Dogecoin has grossly reduced. This means that the likelihood of the Dogecoin price experiencing substantial declines is now much lower, suggesting a more stable and possibly bullish outlook in the near term. So far, analysts have suggested that if Dogecoin can bounce from its current price level of around $0.19, it could easily break the $0.22 threshold and prepare for its next bullish price target. While The Coach is confident of Dogecoin’s bullish outlook, he acknowledged that a few obstacles could hinder this projected price increase. Factors like market volatility could create sudden short-term fluctuations, making sustained price growth challenging for Dogecoin. Additionally, profit-taking from short-term holders could also stall Dogecoin’s momentum. DOGE Unlikely To Hit $1 This Month In another more recent X post, The Coach expressed optimism about Dogecoin’s price movement, highlighting the overall positive market trend for DOGE. However, he disclosed that it was uncertain if the meme coin could reach $1 this month. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts ‘The Final Ascent’ For Bitcoin Price, Why A Rise To $300,000 Is Possible From Here While a $1 price target may seem overly ambitious, The Coach has emphasized that Dogecoin will inevitably reach higher highs. He also noted that if Dogecoin were to hit the $1 mark, it would happen rapidly and without warning, leaving many struggling to comprehend how it occurred. Moreover, the analyst has revealed that with the support of SpaceX and Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Elon Musk and the newly elected US President, Donald Trump, Dogecoin could see even more bullish price increases, possibly reaching the new price highs around the $0.3 level. As of writing, the price of the meme coin is trading at $0.197, reflecting a 3.66% rise in the last 24 hours and a 24.15% increase over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap.

35945418,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652226,1731101441,Ethereum Analyst Sees Altseason Potential As BTS Is Still Outpacing ETH – Time To Buy Altcoins?,"Ethereum has finally surged after breaking through a critical resistance level that had kept the price subdued since early August. This move has shifted market sentiment, as many investors and analysts previously doubted ETH’s potential in the current cycle, expecting it to lag behind. However, Ethereum’s recent strength is starting to reshape these perspectives. Prominent analyst and investor Ali Martinez recently shared insights indicating that while Ethereum’s momentum is building, the much-anticipated “Altseason” hasn’t arrived just yet. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target According to Martinez, this stage of the cycle typically sees Bitcoin outperforming Ethereum and other altcoins—a common pattern as BTC often leads market rallies. This dynamic could provide a strategic opportunity for investors looking to enter ETH and other altcoins before the broader market euphoria begins. As Ethereum gains traction, market participants are keeping an eye on further confirmations of its breakout, with many speculating that once Bitcoin’s lead cools, capital may flow more aggressively into altcoins. Ethereum Waking Up Ethereum is making a remarkable comeback, surging over 22% in just two days of strong upward momentum. While this performance is impressive, key data highlights that Bitcoin is still leading the market, slightly overshadowing Ethereum’s gains. For savvy investors, this could present a prime opportunity to start accumulating Ethereum and select altcoins before they potentially rally in the next phase of the cycle. Ali Martinez, a prominent analyst, recently shared a Glassnode chart revealing insights on the “Bitcoin Altseason Indicator.” This tool compares net capital flows between Bitcoin and Ethereum, showing that while Ethereum is on the rise, Bitcoin’s net capital change is currently outpacing it. This trend confirms that Altseason—where altcoins outperform Bitcoin—hasn’t begun yet. Martinez points out that such dynamics are typical for this stage, with Bitcoin usually leading the initial rally and Ethereum following shortly after. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Signals Equilibrium After Trump Victory – A Clear Path To New Highs? Historically, Altseason often arrives once Bitcoin’s price momentum stabilizes, as capital flows from Bitcoin into high-potential altcoins. Many seasoned investors recognize this part of the cycle as an ideal time to accumulate ETH and strong altcoins at attractive prices before the broader market shifts its focus. In the coming weeks, the relationship between BTC and ETH performance will be closely watched, potentially setting up a shift in market sentiment and capital distribution. ETH Technical View Ethereum recently surged past a critical resistance at $2,820, breaking above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) and touching the 200-day moving average (MA) at $2,955. This marks a significant bullish move, as ETH had been trading below these levels since early August, and reclaiming these indicators is seen as a positive signal for further gains. For the bullish momentum to continue, ETH must break above and sustain itself above the daily MA at $2,955, solidifying this breakout as a foundation for the next phase of the uptrend. However, some analysts suggest that a period of consolidation just below the 200 MA could be beneficial, allowing ETH to gather strength for a more sustained rally. This pause could temper the rising euphoria and avoid overextension in the short term. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Shares Correlation With S&P500 – Last Dip Before It Hits $10,000? As the market sentiment turns increasingly optimistic, many investors are eyeing this level closely. Holding above these critical indicators would give bulls more control, potentially setting Ethereum up for a more robust recovery as it targets new highs.

The largest and oldest crypto eked out a new record price of $77,105 during U.S. trading hours, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Index (XBX), though it's only eked out a 0.2% gain over the past 24 hours. The broad market CoinDesk 20 Index outperformed, with the native tokens of Cardano {{ADA}} and Polygon (POL) surging 15%.  Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} advanced 3% to just shy of $3,000, its strongest price in more than three months, as the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector gains steam. DeFi stands to gain the most from more accommodating digital asset regulations in the U.S. that crypto market participants hope for from a new administration led by Trump. Solana {{SOL}}, a layer-1 blockchain network considered the main contender for Ethereum's DeFi dominance, topped $200 for the first time since April.

While crypto assets booked double-digit gains during this week, with BTC sitting at record highs, funding rates for perpetual swaps on crypto exchanges are much closer to neutral levels than the market top in early March, CoinGlass data shows. Funding rate refers to the amount long traders pay shorts to take the opposite side of a trade. When funding rates are negative, shorts pay the fee to longs, as this relationship often occurs during bearish periods.  ""Zero signs of market froth in funding rates,"" noted Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat.  The muted frothiness suggests that crypto prices have much more room to advance higher, with one market participant seeing bitcoin getting as high as $125,000.  ""We're in the 7th inning of [the] bull market,"" or at the beginning of the final third of the rally, Ari Paul, founder and CIO of digital asset investment firm BlockTower, said in an X post.  He said recent buyers appear to be positioning for a six- to 12-month rally, driven mostly by institutional investors rather than retail, suggesting a more gradual climb to his targets. Retail interest will increase along with leverage as the rally progresses. He recommended buying and holding a few select crypto assets as a strategy over the coming months, arguing that more active trading will likely be more profitable at the final stages of the bull run.

The world's oldest digital currency had been hovering in and out of the $70K mark since last week, in the run-up to the U.S. election, as crypto investors saw Trump's re-election prospects build at the time. BTC, then, for the first time, zoomed past the $74K mark , just as Trump took a lead over Vice President Kamala Harris during the vote count. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) continued to see a gradual rise , as Trump secured a win. The world's largest cryptocurrency has received a shot in the arm lately after Trump embraced it as part of his election campaign - a marked departure from President Joe Biden's current government, which has cracked down on the sector. ""There's been a tremendous surge in crypto interest after Trump won the election. This, combined with the Federal Reserve's rate cut on Thursday, spurred institutions to make the plunge into crypto markets,"" said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. The Federal Open Market Committee unanimously cut the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.50%-4.75% . ""With more rate cuts coming, the prospect of pro-crypto regulations, and a continued China stimulus, it makes sense that institutions are flocking to Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF, and we expect even more in the coming months,"" Mei added. Trump had also made an appearance at the annual Bitcoin Conference in July, and has said he wanted to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world."" ""In the near term, markets will naturally be focused on the President-elect's pro-business policies and a crypto-friendly regime, and the path of least resistance is likely to be higher prices over the near term,"" said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SOFA.org. JD Vance, the vice president-elect, is also widely known to be friendly towards crypto. ""A Trump administration is going to be viewed as far more friendly to the industry, and I suspect we’ll see outperformance in assets and networks that have come under fire from US-based regulators,"" Seeking Alpha analyst Mike Fay said.

Researcher Predicts Speculative Surge Could Spark Market Revival,"Ethereum has had a rough year, but recent insights from industry insiders indicate a possible comeback. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, recently indicated that Ethereum is oversold. He thinks that raising speculative interest in the altcoin will enable its comeback. This comes as Ether tries to catch up with rivals such as Bitcoin and Solana, which far exceeded it in 2024. Related Reading: Binance Coin Breaks $600! Is There More Upside Ahead For BNB? A Shift In Market Sentiment Sigel spoke on The Tie’s latest episode in which he hopes Ethereum will go in the right direction. He also noted that, although Ethereum faces problems, particularly regarding EIP-4844 in which it changes its economic model, opportunities can still emerge for a “bottom.” .@matthew_sigel “I think ETH is oversold…Speculation will come back to this market and I don’t think it’s going to ignore Ethereum.” https://t.co/5pMcZBLzfi — VanEck (@vaneck_us) November 7, 2024 The market is now a little conservative, but Sigel sees the commodity drifting back into speculation, bringing price back up and advocates to the trade again. That also places it in line with larger Ethereum expectations. Analysts are even expecting ETH to trade between $2,199 and $3,019 in 2024, with some expecting a spike to above $5,000 by 2025. Excitement generated earlier this year by acceptance of spot Ethereum ETFs has brought a regulated gateway to investors for entering the market, both retail and institutional investors. This development may cause massive inflows into Ethereum with enormous financial inflows, further buttressing its price. Technical Analysis And Price Predictions According to the latest technical analysis, Ethereum must break above $3,000 to sustain its bullish sentiment, and many analysts believe this may well open roads for a new record high. According to the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, we can see all sorts of possible prices for the following years, with estimates reaching as high as $12,000 by 2030. However, some are concerned about Ethereum’s long-term economic strategy. Sigel said that Layer-2 networks have started to claim more of Ethereum’s blockspace, resulting in lower transaction fees and income. This development has led some investors to lose faith in Ethereum as a deflationary asset. If this trend continues without changes to link Layer-2 networks more closely with Ethereum’s ecosystem, VanEck’s long-term price targets may be jeopardized. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks The Road Ahead For Ethereum Despite these problems, commentators express a genuine feeling of optimism about Ethereum’s future. The prospect of fresh speculative activity, along with the regulatory certainty given by ETF approvals, could be exactly the spark for a significant comeback. As the market evolves and reacts to these developments, investors are looking for signals that a positive trend will return to Ethereum. While Ethereum confronts challenges, experts believe that a combination of increasing interest and good market conditions might pave the way for a resurgence in 2024 and beyond.

35937115,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652205,1731090646,"Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Sounds Alarm Of Break Through Key Resistance, Why A Rally Could Follow","Based on chart indicators, the Cardano price has just broken through a key resistance, sparking the promise of a potential uptrend. While the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a possible bullish rally, a crypto analyst has also shared the downside risks Cardano could experience if it fails to hold crucial support levels. Cardano Price Breaks Falling Wedge Resistance, Signals Uptrend The Cardano price appears to be on a significantly bullish trajectory, as a crypto analyst on TradingView identified as ‘MyCryptoParadise’ has shared an in-depth analysis of its recent price movements. According to the crypto expert, Cardano had just broken through the descending resistance in its Falling Wedge pattern. Related Reading: Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price Ceiling At $137,000, But Is This The Highest BTC Can Go? This move is typically seen as a bullish signal, as the Falling Wedge chart pattern is often associated with positive trend reversals. The Falling Wedge pattern is a unique technical indicator that occurs in an upward trend. It is characterized by two descending trend lines, with one representing highs and the other lows. The crypto analyst has stated that Cardano’s price is approaching a distinctive level, which he calls a “demand zone.” If it can experience a strong rebound from this point, Cardano could start its anticipated upward trend at this crucial level. The demand zone at $0.0313 acts as a vital support level where there’s likely to be buying interest. If Cardano can experience a bounce from this point, the cryptocurrency could rally and break out above the $0.417 resistance level, strengthening the analyst’s bullish scenario while hinting at higher resistance targets. The market expert discloses that when Cardano breaks the $0.417 resistance, there could be a notable shift in its present market structure. Notably, Cardano has experienced slow growth and muted market performance over the past few years. Due to the cryptocurrency’s low price and sluggish momentum, many investors have voiced out frustration previously, with some tagging ADA a dead coin and others alleging that Cardano is a ghost chain. However, recently, Cardano has been on a bullish trajectory, as its price has been experiencing significant gains over the past few weeks. According to data from CoinmarketCap, the Cardano price is trading at $0.434, marking a 17.29% increase in the past 24 hours and a 27.84% rise over the past week. The cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume is also up by more than 65%, underscoring investors renewed interest and confidence in the altcoin. Potential Risks If ADA Fails To Hold Key Support Levels TheCryptoParadise has revealed on TradingView the downside risks that could occur if Cardano fails to hold the aforementioned critical support levels at around $0.313. The analyst emphasized that if the Cardano price fails to hold above the $0.313 level, it might experience a steep decline toward the critical support zone between $0.274 and $0.290. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Looking To Close Weekly Candle Above The Yellow Line, Why $10 Is Possible If This Happens The analyst has disclosed that this support zone is an important price floor where buyers could step in to prevent further price decreases. He also highlighted that ADA will need to reclaim the $0.313 support to maintain a bullish outlook. However, if it closes a day below $0.274, it would most likely invalidate this bullish scenario, increasing the risk of further price declines and possibly even setting a new low.

42435179,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLQyH,1731087873,Stablecoin Giant Tether Enters Oil Trade by Financing $45M Middle Eastern Crude Deal,"Tether said its investment arm financed 670,000 barrels of Middle East crude oil worth $45 million.  The issuer of the USDT stablecoin wants to play a role in the crucial $10 trillion global trade finance industry.  Tether said its investment division financed a $45 million crude oil transaction between a major oil company and commodity trader, part of the USDT issuer's attempt to expand beyond its influential stablecoin roots.  The issuer of USDT, the third-largest cryptocurrency, is seeking to carve out a niche within the $10 trillion trade finance industry — which plays a crucial role in facilitating international trade and commerce by reducing risks associated with cross-border transactions. Tether revealed its plan to enter commodities trade finance last month, and it's also expanding into venture capital, bitcoin {{BTC}} mining and artificial intelligence.  The October transaction involved 670,000 barrels of Middle East crude oil cargo and took place between ""a publicly traded super-major oil company"" and ""top-tier commodity trader,"" Tether said.  ""This transaction marks the beginning, as we look to support a broader range of commodities and industries,"" Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement. ""With USDT, we’re bringing efficiency and speed to markets that have historically relied on slower, more costly payment structures.""  Tether's USDT stablecoin plays a foundational role in crypto trading, serving as a form of liquidity on exchanges and increasingly as a payments and savings vehicles in emerging economies. It's a massively profitable business: The company said it has raked in $7.7 billion in net profits this year so far, in large part from yields earned on its stockpile of $80 billion U.S. Treasury bills. The company has used profits to diversify from stablecoin issuance, investing in startups, bitcoin mining, energy production and AI.  A Wall Street Journal report last month alleged Tether is under U.S. criminal investigation for possible violations of sanctions and anti-money-laundering laws, something the company denied. Ardoino said in an interview with CoinDesk that the company respects American sanctions and is dedicated to remaining a large buyer of U.S. debt.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MINING | USDT,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/08/stablecoin-giant-tether-enters-oil-trade-by-financing-45m-middle-eastern-crude-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52cd9261977a2c01a61cee9e975a7c0e6f2ae719-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35933183,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652163,1731085244,"Bitcoin Open Interest Soars As Top Crypto Breaks $76,000 – Details","Bitcoin has achieved new highs, surpassing $76,000 for the first time in history. This spike follows Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, which many investors believe will create a more favorable atmosphere for cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks Bitcoin’s price reached $76,152 on TradingView, translating to a 2% increase in the last 24 hours, and a 10% increase in the weekly timeframe. Election Euphoria Fuels Bitcoin’s Surge The cryptocurrency market is brimming with hope. Investors have long predicted that a Trump presidency would be good for digital assets. Trump’s past pessimism toward cryptocurrencies has altered considerably, and he now sees himself as a pro-crypto candidate. His campaign has even accepted cryptocurrency payments and suggested establishing America as the “crypto capital of the world.” What was the result? A rise in Bitcoin’s value has boosted shares of associated companies such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy. This rally goes beyond speculation. Bitcoin has grown due to institutional investment. More than $50 billion has gone into Bitcoin ETFs, indicating that traditional financial institutions are accepting cryptocurrencies. Analysts expect Bitcoin to hit $150,000 by 2025 if present trends continue. Record Open Interest Signals Confidence The Open Interest (OI) of Bitcoin, which is the aggregate number of outstanding futures and options contracts, has increased in tandem with its price. In the span of two days, OI experienced a significant increase of 13.29%, resulting in a remarkable $45.41 billion. The current surge suggests that traders are not merely passive observers; rather, they are actively taking measures to prepare for potential price increases. Although there are always hazards, the increase in OI is generally considered a sign of confidence in the market’s upward trend. Due to this, it is imperative to evaluate the market’s dynamics by taking into account a variety of factors. Related Reading: Binance Coin Breaks $600! Is There More Upside Ahead For BNB? Market participants are increasingly optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, with many predicting that institutional interest will only rise as regulatory clarity improves under Trump’s administration. A potent combination of market forces and political circumstances has the potential to further elevate Bitcoin. What Are The Future Prospects For Bitcoin? Volatility in the crypto markets is expected to persist as the results of the US election unfold. Early signs show that Trump’s actions may result in increased acceptance and support for cryptocurrencies. As investors consider these developments, many are wondering how high Bitcoin may go. The present market attitude mirrors a bigger trend: Bitcoin has demonstrated resiliency in previous election cycles, frequently reaching new highs following the election. As institutional investors stay optimistic and retail interest soars, the question isn’t whether Bitcoin will rise—but how quickly it will grow in this new political scenario.

42435189,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLRmz,1731084881,Ethereum Foundation's Treasury Shrunk 39% Over 2 1/2 Years to $970M,"The Ethereum Foundation on Friday released its long-awaited financial report, revealing it had $970.2 million in its treasury as of Oct.31  That's down 39% from $1.6 billion on March 31, 2022, the last date for which the foundation published its financials.  Most of foundation's holdings are in crypto (81.3%), with the vast majority of that held in ether (ETH).  The foundation spent about $240 million over 2022 and 2023, and ETH has slid 22% since the last snapshot from March 2022.  The Ethereum Foundation, which stewards development of the second-largest blockchain, on Friday released its long-awaited financial report, revealing it had $970.2 million in its treasury as of Oct.31.  That's down 39% from $1.6 billion on March 31, 2022, the last date for which figures were previously available.  The disclosure comes as many community members have pushed the foundation to be more transparent about its financial holdings, given its critical role and vast influence over the Ethereum ecosystem. The last time the foundation published a financial report was in April 2022.  Most ($788.7 million, or 81.3%) of the foundation's treasury is held in crypto, with the vast majority (99.45%) of that in ether (ETH). The remaining $181.5 million is non-crypto investments and assets.  “We choose to hold the majority of our treasury in ETH. The EF believes in Ethereum’s potential, and our ETH holdings represent that long term perspective,” the report says. “At the same time, the goal of the EF’s treasury is to fund important public goods for the Ethereum ecosystem for years into the future. To achieve this goal we must follow a conservative treasury management policy that ensures we have sufficient resources even in the case of a multi-year market downturn.”  Since the last snapshot in March 2022, when ETH was trading around $3,300, the price has slid 22% to roughly $2,600, according to CoinMarketCap data.  The foundation spent $105.4 million in 2022 and $134.9 million last year, it revealed.  The figures are consistent with statements made in September by foundation researcher Justin Drake, who shared in a Reddit AMA that the foundation spends about $100 million a year and holds $650 million in its main wallet. The foundation has roughly 10 years of runway, Drake said then.  The foundation also revealed it is implementing a new conflict of interest policy, emphasizing that researchers and developers must inform the organization if they plan to take on any additional outside work and whether they plan to invest in funds. If the outside work pays more than $25,000 annually, and if they want to make investments, these must be reviewed by a discussion group.  People working at the foundation will not be allowed to take on outside work and get paid in illiquid assets with an unknown market value, including advisorship token packages before the launch of projects, the report emphasized.  The conflict-of-interest policy comes after two top Ethereum researchers, Drake and Dankrad Feist, revealed last week that they would be leaving their advisorship roles at EigenLayer, the giant restaking platform on Ethereum.  Their positions with the Eigen Foundation came with a significant token payout from EigenLayer, a fact that raised concerns of conflict of interests when the two developers disclosed their new roles in May.

This new milestone has ignited widespread excitement and confidence among investors, who now see the potential for further gains. Key data from Carl Runefelt reveals that Bitcoin ETFs experienced a historic surge, with $1.38 billion in net daily inflows. This record-breaking figure highlights institutional demand for Bitcoin, as major players like BlackRock are buying BTC in anticipation of long-term growth. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target The influx into Bitcoin ETFs underscores a broader trend of institutional adoption, with increasing interest from financial giants as they recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and hedge against economic uncertainty. Runefelt’s analysis suggests that this level of demand is unprecedented, marking a turning point that could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. The recent surge is not just a technical breakout but also a fundamental shift driven by institutional confidence, setting Bitcoin up for potential further highs as large-scale investors continue to enter the market. Bitcoin Hits New ATH Bitcoin has surged into uncharted territory, breaking its previous all-time highs once again to reach a new peak that has captivated the crypto community. This historic rally comes on the heels of the U.S. election, which saw Donald Trump emerge victorious. Market sentiment suggests that Trump’s pro-crypto stance could have played a role in driving renewed confidence among U.S. investors, who are looking to Bitcoin as a hedge amid changing economic policies. Adding to this momentum, traditional investors increasingly pour into Bitcoin through ETFs, marking a significant shift in institutional interest. According to key data from SoSo Value, shared by prominent analyst Carl Runefelt on X, Bitcoin ETFs experienced record-breaking daily inflows yesterday, totaling an astounding $1.38 billion. This historic inflow underscores the growing appetite from institutional players who are viewing Bitcoin as a critical asset for their portfolios. The recent bullish shift among institutions follows a prolonged 7-month accumulation phase that had cast shadows of doubt over Bitcoin’s potential to break new highs this year. Many investors remained cautious, with market volatility and uncertainty testing their confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Signals Equilibrium After Trump Victory – A Clear Path To New Highs? With institutional backing at record levels, Bitcoin’s recent rally could signify the beginning of an extended bullish phase. As big players like BlackRock buy-in through ETFs, the market sees this as a signal of renewed strength. All eyes are now on Bitcoin’s next moves, with analysts suggesting the recent price action may only be the beginning of a larger bull run for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. BTC Pushing Up: Strong Price Action Bitcoin is trading at $76,000 after reaching new all-time highs. BTC is entering a strong consolidation phase above the previous record level of $73,800. This price zone is crucial for bulls, as holding above it could provide stability for Bitcoin’s rally to continue. Analysts are closely watching this level; if BTC can respect it, the bullish momentum may persist, encouraging further gains. However, the recent euphoria could lead to a consolidation phase just below $77,000—a level some experts identify as a short-term local top. This resistance could take time to overcome as the market digests recent gains and awaits fresh catalysts for another breakout. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sets $3,400 Target Once ETH Breaks Key Resistance – Details Despite potential consolidation, demand remains robust, and on-chain data reflects strong buying pressure that could continue driving the price upward. The technical outlook suggests further upside potential if Bitcoin can stay above $73,800 over the coming days. Bulls are optimistic, as it could establish a solid foundation for the next leg up in Bitcoin’s ongoing rally.

Solana is again capturing market attention, surging 8.4% today to break past the $200 resistance level. This follows a strong performance earlier in the week, where Solana overtook BNB to claim the fifth spot in the cryptocurrency rankings. The recent rally coincided with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s announcement of a 25 basis points rate cut on November 7, which appears to have fueled the market’s momentum. Solana Bull Flag Signals Further GainsNow, analysts are pointing to bullish signals on Solana’s weekly chart, suggesting the possibility of continued gains.For instance, analyst ""Titan of Crypto"" identified a Bull Flag pattern on Solana's weekly chart, which is a breakout signal that follows a consolidation phase. This configuration emerged as Solana cracked the $200 resistance level.Based on the height of the flagpole, the analyst suggests a potential price target for Solana near $1,400, reflecting strong market optimism. Also, in an analysis shared today, Rekt Capital, a well-known market analyst, noted that Solana has already surpassed the $202 resistance level even before the close of the weekly candle.The analyst emphasized that this development marks the end of a multi-month downtrend, with a confirmed weekly close above $202 potentially setting the stage for sustained rallies above this level.In a separate disclosure , crypto trader Cyclop highlighted price predictions for leading tokens like Solana. The trader believes that during the anticipated 2025 supercycle, Solana's destiny is a price range of $400-$600.Rising Market DominanceNotably, amid the ongoing Solana bull run, the asset's market dominance has surged to a new all-time high of 3.81%. This metric reflects the growing share of Solana’s market cap relative to the broader crypto market. Historically, Solana experienced periods of rapid dominance growth, particularly during its rise from $30 to $100 in mid-2021.

A total of 49,000 BTC options and 295,000 ETH options officially expired today, November 8.For Bitcoin, the expiration shows a Put-Call ratio of 0.72, indicating a slightly more bearish outlook among options traders who had initially bet on a significant price correction. The notional value of the 49,000 BTC options that expired worthless stands at $3.7 billion.Notably, last Friday—when the market was in a bearish phase—28,000 Bitcoin options, valued at around $2 billion, expired .

However, Bitcoin has maintained its uptrend, setting higher highs each day for the past four consecutive days.At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $76,300 after reaching an all-time high of $76,950 last night.

35931373,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100958,1731078615,"Bitfinex Analysts Set $3,200 as Ethereum Short-Term Target Amid Heightened Investor Appetite","Analysts from Bitfinex are confident that a growing investor appetite in Ethereum could drive its price to $3,200 in the short-term. The analysts shared this view during a recent interview. Notably, Donald Trump’s re-election as U.S. president has boosted investors’ appetite for risk assets, including Ethereum (ETH), the second-biggest crypto by market cap. Ethereum ETF Inflows Surge After Trump’s Victory This is reflected in the increased inflow into spot-based Ethereum ETFs. According to data from Farside, the nine Ethereum ETF products saw an outflow of $63.2 million a day before the U.S. election. Expectedly, these funds recorded zero flow on election day. Following Trump’s re-election on November 6, Ethereum ETF net inflows surged to $52.3 million on that day, and $72.9 million the following day.ETH to Hit $3,200 in Short-Term Given the influx of capital into Ethereum ETFs and heightened investor appetite, Bitfinex experts project that Ethereum could hit a short-term target of $3,200. They expect this prediction to play out in the next few months. Specifically, the analysts expect Ethereum’s rally to commence as soon as Bitcoin’s market dominance surpasses 60%. For context, Bitcoin’s market dominance stood at 59.7% as of 1:32 p.m. (UTC). The figure had surged to over 60% earlier today but dropped below this level at press time. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $2,937, suggesting that it requires a slight increase of 8.95% to reach the $3,200 target. Should ETH hit the target, it would still be down 34.57% from its all-time high of $4,891, registered on November 16, 2021. Experts Remain Confident Amid Price Correction Threats While Bitfinex is optimistic about a potential rally for Ethereum, the recent spike in ETH net flows into derivative exchanges has triggered concerns about an imminent price correction. On November 5, CryptoQuant reported netflows of 82,000 ETH into derivatives exchanges, suggesting that such movements usually pave the way for increased volatility or price dip. https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1853802575016906763Furthermore, several Ethereum whales have been coming out of multi-year dormancy to sell ETH, mounting pressure on the asset. As reported yesterday, three Ethereum addresses, dormant for over eight years, sold over 44,700 ETH. This comes after the price of ETH rose to $2,700. With analysts eyeing ETH’s surge to $3,200, more dormant Ethereum addresses might offload some of their holdings, negatively impacting the coin’s price. Nonetheless, Bitfinex analysts believe that the ETH price will skyrocket in a month, highlighting Ethereum’s surging open interest as a potential catalyst for the increase. According to the experts, Ethereum’s open interest recently surged to abnormal levels, hitting $1.3 million compared to the $800,000 recorded throughout August. “This leads us to believe that in a month, Ether should start seeing good upside,” they remarked.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/bitfinex-analysts-set-3200-as-ethereum-short-term-target-amid-heightened-investor-appetite/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitfinex-analysts-set-3200-as-ethereum-short-term-target-amid-heightened-investor-appetite,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The crypto market has immensely benefited from Donald Trump’s November 5 election win. For context, the sector’s firstborn, Bitcoin, surged to a new all-time high of $76,943 on Thursday.Amidst the bullish sentiments, Fundstrat’s chief investment officer, Thomas Lee, has insisted that the global market has more upsides, cryptocurrencies included. In a Friday session at CNBC’s Squawk Box, Lee stated that Bitcoin and small caps would surge tremendously in the near term.Trump’s Win Good for Bitcoin: LeeThe CNBC contributor stated that prior to the elections, the global market faced turbulence as uncertainties prevailed. However, Trump’s emergence as the 47th US president would spur a rebound and further market upsides for the crypto assets, including Bitcoin.Lee stated that the impending rally would be massive, citing regulatory changes under Trump and a growing Bitcoin relevance in the global market. Notably, Trump’s pro-crypto stance has been evident from the inception of his electoral campaign, as he has promised to make America the global capital of Bitcoin.As a result, Lee expects his win to immensely impact Bitcoin’s price. Furthermore, the Fundstrat CIO argued that Trump’s better market experience, owing to lessons from his first tenure, is boosting investor confidence, resulting in the market uptrend since his win.With Bitcoin being part of the Trump trade, Lee envisions a rise to six figures for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap before the end of the year. He also reviewed his earlier $150,000 Bitcoin call, noting that there is a lot of upside for the premier asset.Expert Asserts Bitcoin Will Curb Growing US DebtsNotably, one of Trump’s electoral promises is to reduce the growing US deficit , which has now toppled $35 trillion. When asked if the intended debt reduction can be achieved by cutting taxes and spending, Lee noted it would be difficult to accomplish the slash through the means.However, the CNBC contributor noted that Bitcoin would play a crucial role in the US deficit cut. Lee stated that Bitcoin is a potential Treasury asset, and its long-term appreciation track record could help offset the US debt.Interestingly, Trump teased the same approach in the past. The US President-elect earlier stated that Bitcoin could help solve America’s growing debt, alleging he would hand its creditors “a little Bitcoin check.”Meanwhile, discussions to create a US Bitcoin Treasury reserve have gained momentum. Senator Cynthia Lummis noted after Trump’s win that the country would adopt the asset as a hedge against economic uncertainties.

35931371,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100964,1731077134,Bitcoin Realized Cap Hits ATH of $656B as Price Follows 2016 Halving Year Direction,"Bitcoin has entered an exciting phase, especially with its realized cap reaching a record-breaking level as price follows the direction of the 2016 halving year. The Realized Cap leverages Bitcoin’s purchase prices to measure its value, accurately gauging its current market strength. Amid the latest rally on the back of Donald Trump’s election victory, this metric has reached a massively bullish level, confirming the strength of the uptrend.Bitcoin Realized Cap Claims ATHOn Nov. 5, Bitcoin’s rally gained momentum, building off U.S. election results. This rally pushed Bitcoin’s price to a new peak of $76,990, indicating a solid trend of upward movement. Although BTC briefly corrected, it swiftly resumed its bullish trajectory, looking to mark its fourth consecutive day of gains today. This upward trend has propelled major indicators, with Bitcoin’s realized cap reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $656 billion. According to Glassnode, the realized cap, which now reflects a 3.8% growth over the past month, shows a notable $2.5 billion in net inflows. Glassnode’s recent data confirms the importance of this figure, as this level of inflow is one of the highest since January 2023. Bitcoin Realized Cap | Glassnode It bears mentioning that when realized cap grows at such a rate, it typically indicates intense buying interest and confidence in Bitcoin’s future. Essentially, investors are moving funds into Bitcoin, raising its realized cap and strengthening the overall market.One factor contributing to this rise in realized cap is the consistent capital inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. The market saw an impressive $1.37 billion inflow into these ETFs yesterday, marking the highest in history. These products now hold over 1 million BTC.Current Bitcoin Halving Year Similar to 2016 TrendMeanwhile, amid the recent price action, data from CryptoQuant confirms that Bitcoin’s cumulative return index in 2024 follows a pattern remarkably similar to the 2016 halving cycle. This year’s movements, notably post-election, mirror the 2016 cycle when Bitcoin also experienced a steady climb after a temporary dip. In that halving year, Bitcoin saw a drop on the 210th day and entered a two-month consolidation phase, only to rise steadily in the third quarter. Bitcoin Cumulative Return Index on Halving Years CryptoQuant Bitcoin Cumulative Return Index on Halving Years | CryptoQuant In the 2024 cycle, Bitcoin has followed a comparable path, experiencing a slump around day 210, exactly July 29. On this day, BTC declined from $70,000 and continued to drop until it fell below $50,000 on Aug. 5 amid a crash in the U.S. stock market. However, the recent rally on the U.S. election results has driven Bitcoin back to new heights, aligning with the 2016 cycle trajectory. The consistency between these two cycles suggests that Bitcoin could be on track to reach even greater heights before the end of the year.Bitcoin currently trades at $76,244, representing a 7.12% gain over the past week. Peter Brandt had previously noted that Bitcoin would confirm a decisive breakout if it could close Sunday above $76,000.

During the conversation, BitBoy took the opportunity to promote XRP to Don Jr.It’s worth noting that the Trump political camp is already familiar with the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, and is advocating for regulations that could support the industry’s growth.Meanwhile, Armstrong explained to Don Jr. that specific cryptocurrencies like XRP are working to improve the current banking system. He pointed out how XRP aims to simplify international money transfers, allowing the instant and efficient settlement of cross-border payments.XRP: A Network of Value, Like Bitcoin BitBoy further emphasized the unique position of XRP alongside Bitcoin , explaining that the market considers both networks of value. He compared them to the SWIFT system, which currently handles international bank transfers. Notably, Armstrong explained that SWIFT is a network of information where payments involve intermediaries, and the process can take several days to complete.In contrast, with XRP , the same transfer would require as little as 30 seconds since XRP operates as a network of value.BitBoy Delighted to Represent the XRP ArmyAs Armstrong's message gained traction in the XRP community, he expressed his excitement about representing the XRP Army and educating Donald Trump Jr. about XRP.https://twitter.com/BenArmstrongsX/status/1854648871252549954Off-camera, Armstrong claimed to have shared his belief that if the Trump campaign fully embraced Bitcoin, it could have a major impact on the election, swaying voters. Interestingly, this ultimately happened as Trump won the polls on Tuesday with a support base from crypto enthusiasts.Meanwhile, community members have expressed their appreciation for BitBoy’s efforts. For instance, XRP market analyst Cryptoinsightuk remarked that he hadn’t realized Armstrong had advocated for XRP to this extent. Accordingly, he mentioned that he had seen clear signs that President-elect Trump and his son are aware of XRP. “Take from that what you will…” he added, suggesting that XRP may be in a favorable position, and something significant could be on the horizon.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/ben-armstrong-aka-bitboy-explains-xrp-to-trumps-son-don-jr/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ben-armstrong-aka-bitboy-explains-xrp-to-trumps-son-don-jr,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This intense week of upward movement has been followed by profit-taking by traders, which has triggered a pullback in the Dogecoin price. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price has dipped below the $0.20 threshold again, bringing the idea of further price declines. Adding to the concerns, on-chain data reveals a marked decrease in the volume of large transactions among Dogecoin holders. This drop in significant buying activity indicates waning enthusiasm from major investors, suggesting that the meme coin may face increasing pressure to hold onto recent gains. Large DOGE Transaction Volume Crashes: Are Dogecoin Whales Selling? Price action and on-chain data suggest Dogecoin traders are starting to take some profit after a week of intense price rally. Notably, on-chain analytics from IntoTheBlock (ITB) indicate that the volume of large Dogecoin transactions has dropped significantly, with a 36% decline observed in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts ‘The Final Ascent’ For Bitcoin Price, Why A Rise To $300,000 Is Possible From Here The shift could signal that major holders of Dogecoin are starting to reduce their exposure to the meme cryptocurrency after capitalizing on recent gains. This interesting trend is revealed through IntoTheBlock’s ‘Large Transactions Volume in USD’ metric, which tracks the collective value of transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater. This ‘Large Transactions Volume in USD’ puts the value of large DOGE transactions at $3.46 billion in the past 24 hours, which represents a 36% decline in the $5.38 billion volume registered on November 6. Interestingly, this change in trend is particularly noteworthy considering the fact that the trading volume had been on an uptrend since November 2. Similarly, the ‘Large Transactions Volume’ metric shows that 17.76 billion DOGE tokens were moved in 2.72 transactions in the past 24 hours. This also represents a 36% reduction in the 27.7 billion tokens moved in 4,150 transactions on November 6.

Such a steep decline in both transaction volume and the number of large trades may reflect a shift in market sentiment as whales appear to exercise caution. However, the decrease in large transaction activity doesn’t necessarily indicate a widespread sell-off by big holders. It may simply reflect a pause in significant buying as whales hold back on adding to their positions in anticipation of a pullback. That said, price data suggests some holders are indeed selling. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1984 and it could soon attempt another push above the $0.20 mark. On the flip side, a breakdown of the momentum could see Dogecoin retesting support at $0.187.

In a press release on Thursday, the 26th-largest city stated that Detroiters will soon be able to make payments for city-related utilities through Bitcoin. Detroit noted that it will accept tax payments and city fees using cryptocurrencies.The payment options would become available to Detroiters in mid-2025. The Thursday report revealed that Detroit partnered with financial technology giant PayPal to create a platform that would facilitate the payment option.Detroit to Become the Largest US City Accepting BitcoinThe debut of payment options will make Detroit the most populous US city to accept cryptocurrencies as a means of paying taxes and city fees. Notably, states like Utah, Colorado, and Louisiana have already adopted this payment option.However, Detroit will become the largest US city to have adopted cryptocurrencies in that capacity. The Michigan Midwest-based city has a population of 633,218 as of 2023 and was once the fourth-largest, with almost 2 million residents in mid-1950.Meanwhile, two other cities have teased accepting cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in the US, but it remains under deliberation. Miami and New York showed interest in adopting crypto settlements, with the former even creating a native token, Miami Coin.Detroit Open to Blockchain InnovationsIn an addendum to the crypto payment option, Detroit has called on entrepreneurs and innovators in blockchain technology to discuss ideas that would enhance the city’s transparency and data security. According to the report, any individual or group with smart concepts on how the city could leverage blockchain’s endless potential should pitch to Detroit’s director of entrepreneurship and economic opportunity.Detroit’s Mayor Mike Duggan expressed his excitement over the latest milestone, noting that the city is “one of the first major US cities to explore blockchain technology.” Treasurer Nikhil Patel further stated that the crypto payment option will curb the impediments faced by unbanked residences and promote flexibility for those intending to settle city-level utilities using cryptocurrencies.Cryptocurrencies Near Mainstream US AdoptionMeanwhile, the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies underscores a rapidly evolving societal disposition towards the emerging sector. More states and government parastals are warming up to cryptocurrencies as the industry nears mainstream adoption.State-level pension funds in Wisconsin and Michigan have invested a portion of their fiat stash in Bitcoin. Furthermore, other states, such as Florida and Arizona, are considering adopting the pioneering cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset.At the national level, US President-elect Donald Trump and Senator Cynthia Lummis have already teased the concept of creating a national Bitcoin stockpile.

42435177,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLQu3,1731072600,Chinese Nationals Gain Access to Stablecoins in Hong Kong Via New Trial,"Flare and Red Date Technology are conducting trials in Hong Kong to allow mainland Chinese residents to purchase stablecoins issued by IDA through anonymous registration and compliance with Chinese real-name laws.  The initiative uses the China Real-Name Decentralized Identifier System (RealDID) to enable legal transactions with stablecoins like HKDA, aligning with Hong Kong's new stablecoin regulations.  Major stablecoins such as Tether and Circle's U.S. dollar stablecoins do not appear to be included in these trials.  Layer-1 blockchain Flare and decentralized cloud infrastructure company Red Date Technology have announced two trials that will allow mainland Chinese residents to buy stablecoins issued by virtual asset company IDA in Hong Kong.  The first trial will permit anonymous registration on a regulated stablecoin app and the other will facilitate the purchase of tokenized financial products with the stablecoin.  ""With Hong Kong on the cusp of announcing new stablecoin regulations allowing digital currencies on public blockchains, the introduction of this KYC solution trial gives Mainland Chinese residents their first opportunity to legally hold public chain wallets and transact with stablecoins, such as HKDA, a fiat-referenced Hong Kong Dollar stablecoin issued by IDA. This project signals a possible first step in aligning with China's long-term approach to integrating blockchain technology,"" the companies said in a statement.  China has a strict stance on residents dealing in cryptocurrencies, still the country has been investing heavily in blockchain technology. Despite the popularity of crypto trading, state-backed projects are often more focused on B2B and corporate use cases. Blockchains tend to be permissioned rather than permissionless, and NFT projects — including ones released by local museums — have been warned that their purpose should be for collecting rather than speculation.  The trials in Hong Kong will use the China Real-Name Decentralized Identifier System (RealDID) for anonymous registration. A blockchain-based ID system launched in China in December last year, and it is being run by the Blockchain-based Service Network, which is backed by Red Date Technology, and the Ministry of Public Security's First Research Institute.  Under Chinese law, users on digital services platforms are required to undergo real-name registration.

35924180,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24419,1731071864,What Does a Trump Victory Mean for Bitcoin?,"Trump’s approach to crypto regulation is perceived as part of his “America First” economic agenda, focusing on domestic growth and technological leadership. While his promises have generated enthusiasm in the digital asset space, they also underscore a strategic oversight role aimed at ensuring the industry aligns with U.S. interests. His administration’s approach to crypto could set a new regulatory standard that balances growth with safeguards, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in digital finance and blockchain technology. Donald Trump Wins 2024 US Presidential Election Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election marks a historic return to the White House, making him one of the few presidents to achieve a nonconsecutive second term. Trump won a decisive victory by securing the majority of electoral votes, building on his 2020 performance and gaining ground in both traditionally Republican and Democratic areas. He successfully captured key swing states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, surpassing the required 270 Electoral College votes. His campaign focused on core themes of economic revitalization, border security, and national sovereignty, appealing to voters frustrated with inflation and economic uncertainty. In a political landscape marked by division, Trump’s appeal resonated with a broad base of voters seeking change, particularly in rural and working-class areas. Trump made gains among demographic groups that had traditionally supported Democrats, including a portion of Black and Latino voters. His messaging on issues like immigration, tariffs, and conservative social values helped secure support from these groups, leading to his significant advantage in battleground states. This outcome reflects shifting voter priorities and dissatisfaction with the current administration, despite Trump’s controversial past and legal challenges. The election’s implications extend beyond the presidency, with Republicans also taking control of the Senate, which will facilitate Trump’s legislative agenda. The House of Representatives, however, remains uncertain, with ongoing vote counts in competitive districts across the country. If Republicans secure a majority in both chambers, it will likely accelerate Trump’s proposed policies, which include stricter immigration measures, substantial economic changes, and a focus on domestic manufacturing. The GOP’s expanded influence may also impact judicial appointments and regulatory reforms, further solidifying Trump’s policy goals. On the global stage, world leaders have responded with a mix of congratulations and cautious optimism, recognizing Trump’s return as a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy. Allies and adversaries alike anticipate changes in America’s approach to international relations, particularly concerning trade and defence. Leaders from Israel, the United Kingdom, and Japan expressed eagerness to strengthen ties, while others, like China, signalled a readiness to continue navigating a complex relationship. Trump’s return to power signals a renewed focus on “America First” policies, promising a profound impact on both domestic and international affairs in the years to come. How Will a Trump Victory Impact Digital Assets? During his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump positioned himself as a pro-cryptocurrency candidate, advocating for lighter regulations and increased government support for the digital asset sector. He pledged to establish a “national strategic crypto stockpile” that would retain Bitcoin seized by the government, rather than liquidating it as in previous administrations. Additionally, Trump expressed intentions to replace Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler, known for his stringent stance on crypto regulation, with a more industry-sympathetic figure. Trump proposed a “Bitcoin and Crypto Presidential Advisory Council” aimed at providing clearer and more favourable regulatory guidelines, which he argued would bolster the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Donald Trump also promised to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road, a notorious online black market that operated on the dark web and facilitated the sale of illegal goods, including drugs, through cryptocurrency transactions. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 on charges related to his operation of the site, receiving a double life sentence without parole. Trump argued that Ulbricht’s punishment was overly harsh and disproportionate, noting his belief that the justice system had unfairly targeted Ulbricht as an example. The pledge resonated with some in the cryptocurrency community who viewed the case as emblematic of government overreach in early crypto enforcement. Trump’s stance signalled a potential shift in how his administration might view past high-profile crypto-related cases, aiming to address what he described as excessive punishments for non-violent digital offences. Alongside his campaign, Trump introduced his own crypto project, World Liberty Financial, a platform aiming to enable digital currency transactions, including lending and borrowing, within the crypto space. Launched with the WLFI token, the platform has been marketed primarily outside the U.S., largely to circumvent domestic regulatory challenges. Trump’s family members, identified as “Web3 ambassadors” in the venture, stand to benefit from the project’s revenue. However, the initial fundraising goal was scaled back significantly following limited investor interest, underscoring both the challenges and speculative nature of the project. Trump’s potential influence over the crypto industry as president has sparked speculation within the digital asset community. His regulatory promises, if enacted, could result in a more permissive environment, possibly easing some of the pressures the industry has faced under recent SEC crackdowns. By advocating for a “light touch” approach to regulation and seeking new leadership at the SEC, Trump’s administration might promote broader adoption and investment in digital assets. However, Trump’s proposed advisory council and emphasis on domestic Bitcoin mining signal that the sector would still face strategic oversight, possibly aimed at ensuring the industry aligns with U.S. interests. The cryptocurrency market responded to Trump’s election win with significant enthusiasm. Bitcoin soared to record highs, surpassing $75,000 , driven by trader optimism around Trump’s perceived crypto-friendly stance. Other digital assets, including Ethereum, also rallied, along with crypto-related stocks such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy. Analysts suggest that Trump’s administration could provide a more favourable landscape for the industry, catalysing further growth in digital assets and crypto markets. However, experts continue to advise caution, noting the volatility inherent in the sector and the uncertain long-term impact of regulatory changes. Trump’s Stance on Crypto was Heavily Favoured by Crypto Insiders Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign resonated strongly within the cryptocurrency industry, earning him significant support from crypto enthusiasts and those advocating for a regulatory environment more favourable to digital assets. Trump’s promises to make the U.S. a leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, largely through easing regulations, aligned with the industry’s desire for a more stable regulatory framework. His commitment to stimulating growth and innovation by “sane” regulation reforms attracted the attention of both individual crypto users and major blockchain firms, who have long argued that overly restrictive measures stifle innovation and drive business offshore. For many, Trump’s proposals represented a turning point, offering a vision where the U.S. could reclaim a central role in the evolving global crypto environment. Trump’s plans for reform included promises to replace the current SEC chair, Gary Gensler, who had led the policy of pursuing aggressive regulatory actions against crypto firms. This stance resonated with many in the industry who viewed Gensler’s approach as overly punitive and lacking clarity. Trump suggested that regulatory bodies should be led by individuals with a favourable outlook toward crypto, signalling a potential end to what some viewed as excessive oversight, and “ regulation through enforcement ” policies which have been extremely unpopular. His platform proposed creating a “crypto presidential advisory council” staffed by industry advocates rather than sceptics, which would help shape a regulatory structure that balances consumer protections with business freedom. This commitment to a friendlier regulatory environment was seen as a chance to improve transparency and reduce compliance costs, creating a more predictable ecosystem for both established companies and startups. Beyond easing regulatory pressures, Trump’s promise to develop a strategic “national Bitcoin reserve” emphasised his vision of positioning the U.S. as a crypto leader. By advocating for the retention of government-held bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he signalled a proactive approach that contrasted sharply with previous administrations’ limited crypto engagement. His pledge aimed to stabilise crypto markets and demonstrate confidence in digital assets as part of the national strategy, with the potential to attract substantial capital and talent to the U.S. crypto and blockchain sectors. For an industry often characterised by volatility, Trump’s vision provided a framework for establishing the U.S. as a trusted global hub for blockchain technology, attracting talent and investment. The market’s reaction so far to Trump’s victory have reinforced the industry’s enthusiasm for his crypto-friendly stance, with assets like bitcoin reaching record highs amid optimism for more supportive policies. Major crypto exchanges and blockchain companies also saw an uptick in their stock prices, reflecting investor expectations of a revitalised U.S. crypto market. The prospect of Trump’s deregulation and innovation-focused policies gave rise to optimism that the U.S. could better compete with other crypto-friendly jurisdictions, potentially reversing years of regulatory uncertainty. Many in the crypto community see Trump’s leadership as a chance for the U.S. to recapture its edge in blockchain and digital finance, solidifying its position as a pioneering force in the global crypto landscape.

BTC has added 1.7% in the last 24 hours and is about 0.9% below its all-time high of over $76,900, which it reached Thursday afternoon in the U.S., Coindesk Indices data show. The broader digital asset market has risen by about 4%, in part because of outsize gains from Cardano's ADA, which is 16% higher at $0.43. Solana's native token also continued its post-election pump, breaking $200 for the first time since March. SOL trades just above $204, an increase of 8.75% in the last 24 hours.  Traders are eyeing $100,000 as the next level of interest for bitcoin's price, though there is likely to be a period of consolidation first, according to some analysts. BTC is riding the wave of President-elect Trump's victory and the Fed's expected 25 basis-point interest rate cut on Thursday. There are some concerns about a short-term pullback given Trump's proposed tariffs on China and fiscal concerns like rising national debt. BTC is ""defending its top,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk. ""In general, we stick to the idea that the new highs have triggered a powerful new growth wave with the potential to rise to $100-110K within 2-3 months without any significant shakeout.”  Bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S. logged a record $1.38 billion in net inflows on Thursday, the day Trump won the U.S. presidency. BlackRock’s IBIT took on over $1.1 billion in net inflows, the most among all products, and the highest since going live in January. Cumulative net inflows across all products crossed $25 billion for the first time. None of the 12 ETFs showed any net outflows. Ether ETFs logged $78 million in net inflows on renewed bullishness for decentralized finance following Trump’s victory. ETH rose more than 10% on Thursday as expectations of pro-crypto policies and deregulation in a Trump regime boosted investor confidence in the asset.  Chart of the Day  SOL has been one of the biggest winners in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election victory, rising 11% against bitcoin in the past week.  The SOL-BTC ratio has broken out from a triangular consolidation, represented by converging trendlines, meaning bulls are finally willing to lead the price action and open the doors for a move toward 2021 highs.  The weekly candle must close Sunday (UTC) above the upper trendline to confirm the breakout.

Cloud mining is a problematic business when mining profitability is low because customers often lose money on their packages. While cloud mining customers surged year over year, Q3 was still a bad quarter based on operating income. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has broken out of a 7-month consolidation pattern . There is excitement in the cryptocurrency space following the re-election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. With risk-on sentiment taking hold of both the equity and digital asset markets, Bitcoin-adjacent stocks have a strong setup from an investor-interest standpoint. I've covered Bitcoin mining stocks dozens of times in recent years. However, one that I have yet to publish an opinion on is BitFufu ( FUFU ). In this article, we'll look at BitFuFu's core business, recent earnings, and assess whether or not this is a name investors should take a flier on given the macro setup for Bitcoin's price and crypto-related equities. BitFuFU Details BitFufu has two primary lines of business. The company derives revenue from self-hosted Bitcoin mining and, to a larger degree, cloud mining. The latter of which is a consumer product rather than raw mining. Through cloud mining, BitFuFu sells Bitcoin mining capacity to market participants who want rewards from Bitcoin mining without the cost of buying and maintaining mining assets directly. If this sounds familiar, it's similar to how Bitdeer ( BTDR ) generates a portion of its revenue as well. Though, Bitdeer's revenue from cloud hash is smaller than that of BitFuFu. There are other similarities between the companies: Ownership Details FUFU BTDR Shares Outstanding 162.90M 147.35M Float % 10.07% 30.74% Insider Shares 135.00M 80.47M Insider % 82.87% 54.61% Institutional Shares 776.15K 10.21M Institutional % 0.48% 6.93% Source: Seeking Alpha Like Bitdeer, BitFuFu is headquartered in Singapore and has a super small float relative to other mining companies in the public markets. This makes FUFU shares highly volatile during intraday trading given its large percentage of insider ownership. Data by YCharts Since going public in the US earlier this year, FUFU shares have lagged the broader mining industry to a significant degree as evidenced by the total return of the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ). With a market capitalization of $790 million and ten companies over the $1 billion threshold, FUFU is more of a second-to-third tier mining company based on market cap alone. That said, it controls quite a bit of EH/s capacity and ranks top 3 in trailing twelve-month revenue. Q3 Earnings For the quarter ended September, BitFuFu reported top-line revenue of $90.3 million. This was up 47.5% year over year but down 30.2% sequentially. Revenue from self-mining came in at $20.5 million - up 40.4% from last year but down nearly 60% from Q2. This clearly highlights the potential problem with the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin mining as a viable line of business. The saving grace for FUFU shareholders in Q3 was the $68.9 million in cloud mining revenue: $ in millions Q3-23 Q2-24 Q3-24 YoY QoQ Total Revenue $61.2 $129.4 $90.3 47.5% -30.2% Cloud Revenue $45.5 $77.0 $68.9 51.4% -10.5% Self-Mining Revenue $14.6 $51.1 $20.5 40.4% -59.9% Registered Cloud Users 259,929 395,056 455,764 75.3% 15.4% EH/s UM 13.9 24.7 26.2 88.5% 6.07% Cost of Revenue $61.2 $118.4 $89.4 46.1% -24.49% Source: BitFuFu, author's calculations Cloud mining is the clear standout in this table as it accounted for 76% of BitFuFu's total revenue in the quarter. Segment revenue grew 51.4% year over year and only pulled back 10.5% sequentially. Offsetting the reduction in block reward fees was the 15.4% sequential jump in registered cloud users from 395k last quarter to nearly 456k in Q3. In the company's earnings announcement, BitFuFu noted that 63% of its cloud mining revenue came from repeat customers from the prior year period. This is interesting to me, and I'll touch on it in the next section. Data by YCharts From a quarterly net income standpoint, Q3 was not the strongest showing for FUFU. The company lost $5 million in the quarter which amounted to 3 cents per share. After SG&A, R&D, and depreciation BitFuFu's operating loss $5.6 million makes Q3-23 BitFuFu's worst quarter in at least the last 2 and half years. Major Red Flag To shareholders, cloud mining may look great on paper. It's an alternative way to de-risk hash power when mining profitability is low by monetizing it through a willing client base. But when diving deeper into the numbers, one can see it's not actually a very good deal for the customers - which makes the recurring revenue from last year very surprising to me. Consider the revenue per BTC figures by segment below: Business Lines Q3-24 BTC Mined Rev Per BTC Cloud Revenue $68.9 957 $71,996 Self-Mining Revenue $20.5 340 $60,294 Source: BitFuFu, author's calculations BitFuFu generated 340 BTC from its self-mining segment and 957 BTC from its cloud mining segment. Back-of-the-envelope math shows cloud revenue per Bitcoin was $72k versus just $60k per BTC for self-mining. So what's the problem? Data by YCharts Bitcoin never sniffed $72k per coin during the quarter. That means there's a fairly high degree of certainty that BitFuFu's customers lost money on their cloud mining packages between July and September. Consider some of the customer reviews from Trust Pilot. Admittedly, just 31 reviews after servicing hundreds of millions of customers is a small sample. However, users on that website give BitFuFu a Trust Score of 2.3 out of 5. BitFuFu Review (Trustpilot) The picture above is a screen grab of the most recent BitFuFu review on the website. 55% of reviews have been 1-star and share common complaints about KYC issues and transparency regarding costs to the customer. While these could perhaps be isolated incidents, I suspect they're more indicative of a larger problem with the cloud mining model altogether. Namely, if mining profitability is volatile for the miners themselves, then selling cloud mining packages to customers online likely isn't all that different from selling scratch-off tickets. It's not a bad business if you can keep selling hopes and dreams, but I suspect repeat business will be increasingly tougher to keep when customers realize they can just buy and hold BTC through an exchange with their cloud mining package fees instead. Closing Thoughts Compared with other Bitcoin mining stocks, FUFU doesn't look all that bad on the surface. It's a top three mining company by trailing twelve-month revenue, and it has control of over 26 EH/s. However, the relatively low market cap of the company is perhaps indicative of a fundamental problem with BitFuFu's underlying business. Namely, that three quarters of total revenue comes from cloud-based mining; which is not necessarily a good product for consumers. There is an enormous amount of insider holdings. While this could perhaps be viewed as a good thing and aligned incentives with management, it also creates a low-float environment that makes the stock price volatile. I won't call FUFU an outright sell because there is always a chance the share price could move higher with BTC. But there are a lot of ways to make Bitcoin-adjacent bets in the equity market. FUFU is not one that I'm personally going to recommend at this time.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4734722-bitfufu-stock-earnings-a-bad-q3-and-larger-concerns?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35923367.jpeg

35922062,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652174,1731069018,Cardano (ADA) Price Surges 32% In 4 Days: Here’s Why,"Cardano (ADA) has experienced a significant surge over the past four days, with its price increasing by an impressive 32%. In the last 24 hours alone, ADA has climbed 16%, boosting its market capitalization to $14.932 billion. This surge has propelled Cardano back to its position as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Several factors have contributed to this bullish momentum: #1 Bulls Takes Over The Entire Crypto Market The optimistic market sentiment extends beyond Cardano, with the crypto market as a whole experiencing a significant rally. This upward movement has been mostly driven by Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Trump’s administration has committed to ending the “war on crypto” and positioning the United States as a central hub for crypto businesses. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) NVT Ratio Now Highest Since June: What Does It Mean? Adding to the positive momentum, the Federal Reserve’s decision on November 7 to reduce interest rates by 0.25% has provided additional tailwinds for the crypto market. The Fed cited easing labor market conditions and increased confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target. Analysts from The Kobeissi Letter noted that the vote for the rate cut was unanimous. Powell said that “labor market conditions have generally eased” and that “risks to goals remain roughly in balance.” #2 Cardano Whale Activity On-chain analysis firm Santiment has highlighted a surge in whale activity surrounding Cardano. In a recent post on X, they observed that ADA has been “one of the notable surprise altcoins taking flight during this crypto-wide pump.” They suggested that “we may be seeing some retail FOMO coming soon,” acknowledging that this surge “has been a long time coming for the patient ADA community.” Santiment reported that Cardano broke above $0.43 for the first time since July, climbing 25% in three days due to “massive network and whale activity.” Specifically, they pointed out that 37,892 unique ADA addresses made transfers in a single day—the most since the September 4th bottom—and there were 697 transactions exceeding $100,000, also the highest since that date. This uptick in large transactions and active addresses indicates heightened interest from major investors, signaling the potential for continued upward momentum. #3 Technical Breakout Unlike many other altcoins, ADA has been in a prolonged bearish phase. However, the recent surge could mark a pivotal turning point, indicating a potential bullish reversal. Since August, Cardano’s price has been making a series of higher lows. Related Reading: Cardano Might See A Massive Pump Around November 18 – Analyst Exposes 2020 Similarities The current move has also allowed the ADA price to break above a downtrend line that has dictated its price movement since April, after being rejected five times previously. The breakout can be considered significantly bullish as it aligned with the pattern of higher lows. Notably, ADA has surpassed the 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages during this surge. Additionally, ADA has moved past the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level, the most critical horizontal resistance point. A successful retest of this price level at $0.40 today could pave the way for further upside. At press time, ADA traded at $0.4266.

Elon Musk's public discussions about forming a real ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (D.O.G.E.) to streamline government spending have spurred the rise of this parody token.  A parody Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) memecoin has been up 100% in the past 24 hours as it has started to go viral within crypto circles, boosting trading volumes and demand.  A CoinDesk analysis first flagged the Ethereum-based token in mid October, with prices increasing more than 600% since then.  Entrepreneur and vocal dogecoin {{DOGE}} supporter Elon Musk first tweeted the Department of Government Efficiency in early August - spurring the creation of parody tokens - and further revealed plans for his proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” at a Pennsylvania town hall.  The proposed department, abbreviated as D.O.G.E, will seek to make government spending of taxpayer money more efficient while streamlining departments that handle spending.  Musk has previously suggested the proposed department could be run similarly to a corporate company at the Thursday town hall, with incentives for performers and penalties for those who fail to deliver results.  And Republican Donald Trump’s win has pushed those plans closer to reality — pushing prices of the unrelated D.O.G.E token as traders seek to make money on the term’s virality and popularity.  CoinGecko data shows the token is up 155,00% since early September, reaching a market capitalization of $153 million earlier Friday with nearly $30 million in trading volumes.

42435183,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLRJP,1731068031,"Cardano Pumps 16%, Bitcoin Could Pop to $100K After Fed Rate Cut","Cardano's ADA has surged 16% in the past 24 hours, driven by marketwide increases, renewed interest in decentralized finance and growing appeal to retail investors.  Bitcoin has traders eyeing $100,000 in the near term due to recent highs and the Federal Reserve's rate cut. Significant inflows into bitcoin ETFs signaled bullish market sentiment.  Still, post-election market adjustments and policy uncertainties may lead to short-term pullbacks.  Cardano {{ADA}} has surged 16% in the past 24 hours, leading gains among major cryptocurrencies, as traders look to a $100,00 price for bitcoin {{BTC}} in the near term following the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cut on Thursday.  ADA rose above 42 cents in European morning hours Friday to reach levels last seen in late July. Recent price growth catalysts include a marketwide rally and resurging interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) that also spurred gains in ether {{ETH}} and Solana’s {{SOL}}. Some observers also pointed to ADA's appeal among retail investors.  Other majors were mixed after a two-day rally that saw BTC set a record high above $76,000. BTC rose 1.4% with xrp {{XRP}} and BNB Chain’s BNB also gaining less than 2%. ETH advanced more than 4%, while SOL jumped 7.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index rose 3.5%.  The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, as expected. Lower interest rates typically support risk assets like bitcoin by increasing liquidity and weakening the dollar.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking for the first time since President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory, said that the election results would have no effect on the central bank's policymaking in the near-term, quelling fears of a hawkish surprise.  Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. recorded over $1.3 billion in net inflows on Thursday, breaking a March record of $1.1 billion, led by BlackRock’s IBIT.  Against that backdrop, traders are ebullient about bitcoin's prospects.  “In the short term, 100k will be the next major level of interest because of the symbolic nature of the number and the digit change,” Presto Research investment analyst Min Jung said in a note to CoinDesk.”Looking beyond that, we believe the U.S. could eventually add Bitcoin to its balance sheet—maybe as part of a 'strategic Bitcoin reserve' or something similar, but likely under a more low-key name.  “With this in mind, our target is around the 110k range,” Jung added, referring to Trump’s campaign promise he would hoard bitcoin in the national treasury.  Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, mirrored the sentiment.  “The first cryptocurrency rallied sharply on the US election results but is now defending its top and is likely to consolidate its strength before the next surge,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email to CoinDesk. ""In general, we stick to the idea that the new highs have triggered a powerful new growth wave with the potential to rise to $100-110K within 2-3 months without any significant shakeout.”  Some traders cautioned against a short-term pullback, even as they remained generally bullish on BTC.  “Investors are beginning to pull back on some 'Trump trades:' the dollar has reversed much of its post-election gains, and Treasury yields have settled back into recent ranges after a brief whipsaw,” Singapore-based crypto fund QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast Friday.  “As markets consider Trump’s proposed 60% tariff on China and fiscal concerns like the rising national debt, we expect BTC to carry less risk premium compared to equities, potentially positioning it to outperform other risk-on assets.”",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/08/cardano-pumps-16-bitcoin-could-pop-to-100k-after-fed-rate-cut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2500fd4c02192200b60bb10f8e85121c5b0c3f55-3786x2129.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cardano has re-entered the global crypto top 10, propelled by a market capitalization of $15 billion. This development follows a sharp 15% price surge in the last 24 hours, alongside a notable 24.56% gain over the past week. Currently trading at $0.4281, ADA recently touched $0.44, its highest level since July. Analysts suggest this recovery marks the onset of a potentially bullish phase, positioning Cardano for further gains.Bullish Momentum Signals Potential HighsCrypto analyst Javon Marks predicts that Cardano could be entering one of its most bullish phases. He identifies $2.7709 as an initial breakout target, marking a 531% rise from current levels. However, historical patterns suggest that the rally could extend further, with ADA potentially surging to $7.77, a 1,700% rise.https://twitter.com/JavonTM1/status/1854729874482528642In his previous October analysis, Marks noted several bullish signals that suggest a continuation of the upward trend. He compared the current market conditions to previous cycles when Cardano surpassed multiple price targets. According to Marks, a similar trajectory could lead to even greater gains, potentially pushing ADA to $7.82, a rise of over 2,030%.Further backing this bullish outlook, Zayk Charts, a popular analytical account, highlighted a recent falling wedge breakout in Cardano’s price action. This pattern is considered a bullish reversal, indicating the end of a bearish phase and the beginning of a potential rally.Zayk Charts anticipates a 60-70% increase in ADA’s price from current levels, which could push the token above $0.60 if the rally gains momentum.Increased Cardano Development Activity Cardano’s growth is not only reflected in its price but also in its development activity. Recent data from Santiment, a blockchain analytics platform, ranks Cardano as the fourth most active blockchain in terms of development, trailing only Internet Computer, Chainlink, and Hedera. Santiment also noted the potential for retail FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) to fuel further price increases. With Cardano up more than 25% in the past three days, retail traders may soon enter the market, further driving up demand.Historically, such periods of heightened interest often lead to increased price volatility as more participants join the market.Additionally, Santiment observed a spike in whale activity on the Cardano network. On a single day, 697 transactions exceeding $100K were recorded, the highest level of whale activity since September 4.Daily active addresses (DAA) on the network also surged to 37,892, adding further evidence of growing interest in Cardano.

Will this meme coin continue its bullish trend this month? With a 54% surge in the last 7 days, NEIRO is inching closer to a billion-dollar market cap. On the daily chart, the recovery rally has resulted in four consecutive bullish candles, driving the price to nearly a 100% increase.As the bullish momentum behind the First Neiro on Ethereum builds, the broader market expects the uptrend to persist. With the token now trading near its all-time high, the likelihood of reaching the $0.0030 mark increases. Will this bull run continue? Let’s explore.NEIRO Price AnalysisIn the 4-hour chart, the double bottom reversal in the NEIRO token has surpassed the overhead resistance line of a falling-channel pattern. The bullish recovery with the breakout rally accounts for an 85% surge from $0.001266 (the double bottom’s baseline) to the current market price. NEIRO 4-hour Price Chart The breakout has exceeded the previous ATH at $0.0021 and is now challenging the 1.272 Fibonacci extension level. At press time, NEIRO is trading at $0.002336, with a 24-hour surge of 12.31%. Additionally, the token has registered a new all-time high of $0.0025 during the last 24 hours.The surge in buying pressure has triggered bullish crossovers in the exponential moving averages (EMAs). Following the golden crossover and the recent 50-100-day bullish crossover, all key moving averages are aligned bullishly.However, the lack of momentum to exceed the $1.272 Fibonacci level at $0.00249 warns of a bearish crossover in the MACD indicator.Will the First Neiro on Ethereum Cross $0.0025?Given the Fibonacci levels, the lack of momentum could result in a temporary sideways trend on the 4-hour chart, potentially retesting the $0.002160 level or the 100% Fibonacci level. Following a retest and subsequent reversal, the bull run is likely to continue, especially if the broader crypto market remains bullish.The next price targets for the First Neiro on Ethereum are $0.00249 and the $0.0030 psychological mark. Additionally, on a longer-term horizon, the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $0.0051 is a potential target.",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/neiro-fires-up-the-grill-with-new-ath-bulls-target-0-0030/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=neiro-fires-up-the-grill-with-new-ath-bulls-target-0-0030,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Will this bull run continue, driving the price above $0.50? With the trend reversal rally, Cardano is heading toward the $0.50 psychological mark. Currently, it trades at $0.426, with a 24-hour surge of nearly 15%. With a market cap of $14.94 billion, it now ranks as the ninth biggest crypto in the world, surpassing Tron.

At current prices, it has breached above the 3-month high price level. Cardano 4-hour Price Chart With a change of character, the simple moving averages in the 4-hour chart gave a golden crossover. Hence, with a complete trend reversal, the altcoin shows short-term potential to reach the $0.474 mark or the 1.618 Fibonacci level. In the daily chart, the reversal rally shows more promising price targets. As it surpasses the 23.60% level at $0.387, it faces higher price rejection from the $0.442 mark.

Furthermore, with four consecutive bullish candles, it has increased by 33.44% from its 7-day low at $0.32. Will Cardano contine the Bull Run?As Cardano exceeds the 200-day exponential moving average, the uptick in the 50-day EMA teases a bullish crossover with the 100-day EMA. Furthermore, the MACD indicator in the daily chart shows a positive crossover with two massive bullish histograms.

Related Reading: Binance Coin Breaks $600! Is There More Upside Ahead For BNB? Bitcoin’s price trajectory has been the subject of many speculations in the last few weeks but with the election of a known pro-crypto candidate, it seems BTC is moving in the upward direction. At the time of writing, BItcoin was trading at $76,033, up 1.7% and 9.5% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. The figure marks bitcoin new all-time high. Bitcoin: $85,000 Feasible? A prominent crypto analyst suggested that Bitcoin will soon reach $85,000, claiming that the price surge will be fueled by Trump’s return to the White House. In a post, Ali Martinez said that the firstborn cryptocurrency is “playing as predicted.” Martinez predicted that Bitcoin would hit $78,000 but would fall to $71,500 before soaring to an all-time high of $85,000. This is playing as predicted. I think #Bitcoin hits $78,000, retraces to $71,500 and then rebounds to $85,000! https://t.co/8xKUNGZYI8 — Ali (@ali_charts) November 6, 2024 Martinez assured that despite the coin experiencing brief pullbacks, BTC’s price trajectory remains on track, noting the coin’s price stabilized at $74,812 after reaching an all-time record of $76,493. In an earlier post, Martinez has already stated that Bitcoin is “going according to plan.” He said that BTC will increase to $72,000, and then go down to $69,000 before skyrocketing to $78,000. BTC’s Uptrend Another market observer predicted that there is a high likelihood that Bitcoin will increase by 30% to 40% but he does not see that the crypto will repeat the 368% hike which occurred in previous cycles. BTCUSD trading at $75,885 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant made the prediction after BTC hit $75,000 which he believed was influenced greatly by the results of the US election. Ju explained that it triggered the price rally to reach that level, further positioning Bitcoin as one of the largest financial assets in terms of market capitalization. Ju urged investors for subtle profit-taking during the “max pain” phases which are essential to understand the market dynamics of BTC. He said that Bitcoin follows a cyclical nature, explaining that new traders usually endure losses when the market is bearish. After two years, investors see their digital assets change hands when the “max pain” phase dies down. According to him, BTC’s current market environment matched well with an easing period. Related Reading: Fueled By Election Buzz, Memecoins Soar 22% On Pure Speculation—Report Potential Cooling Off However, some analysts projected a possible cooling off for BTC coming after the recent price hike, saying that it has breached the upper Bollinger Band serving as a cue for overbought conditions. They suggested that there could be increasing pressure to sell and profit-taking because of the emergence of red candlestick formations. BTC used to be in the overbought zone or a score above 70 in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart but now, it has retreated to 67.34, indicating “a loss of bullish momentum” and a potential price correction.

Dogecoin Is Moving Inside A Descending Triangle Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern that has recently been forming in the price of Dogecoin. The pattern in question is the “Descending Triangle” from technical analysis (TA), which, as its name suggests, looks like a triangle slopped downwards. The pattern involves two lines between which the price of the asset consolidates: an upper one with a negative slope and a lower one parallel to the time axis. The former is likely to provide resistance to the coin, while the latter can be a point of support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Records $75,000 All-Time High: Here’s If BTC Is ‘Overheated’ Now Like other consolidation patterns in TA, a break out of either of these levels can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. That is, a surge above the triangle can imply a bullish outcome, while a drop under it may lead to bearish action. There are also other triangle patterns in TA that work similarly to the Descending Triangle, with the most prominent example being the Ascending Triangle, which has only one difference: it points up rather than down. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that displays the Descending Triangle that Dogecoin has been moving inside recently: As is visible in the above graph, Dogecoin just recently made a retest of the bottom level of the triangle and successfully found support at it. The memecoin is now on its way up, with a potential retest of the top level to follow. Given the current trajectory of the coin, it might meet the upper line at around $0.198. The coin has already found resistance at the line a few times now, so it’s possible another rejection could take place. Related Reading: Ethereum Volatility Soon? Derivatives Exchanges Receive 82,000 ETH In Deposits In the scenario that a break does happen, however, Dogecoin could end up seeing a notable rise. “Breaking above the $0.198 resistance could spark a 10% move up to $0.220!” notes Martinez. From the current spot price, a run to this $0.220 target would imply growth of more than 15% for the cryptocurrency. It now remains to be seen how DOGE develops in the coming days and if this Descending Triangle pattern would have any effect on its trajectory. DOGE Price Dogecoin enjoyed a sharp rally yesterday as the US presidential elections ended in a win for Donald Trump. At the peak of this surge, the coin approached the $0.220 level, but its price has seen a pullback today as it’s now back under $0.192.

The bullish news aired live on the Chinese media. Notably, China Central TV (CCTV) reported the news on Thursday, a day after Trump's election victory.CCTV noted that Bitcoin surged to unprecedented heights following Trump's win. Although the news reported that Bitcoin grew to a new ATH around $75,000, the crypto firstborn surged to a greater high of $76,946 late Thursday.The leading Chinese media outlet reported that the price surge followed Trump's earlier promise to make the US the world's Bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital. It also noted that the US president-elect pledged to create a US Bitcoin stockpile, strategically storing the premier asset to bolster the country's economy.Crypto Community ReactsFollowing the news, some investors asserted that China could announce a similar plan to strategically store Bitcoin, driving the asset's price higher. However, this remains highly speculative, given the country's strignent rules around Bitcoin.Another faction praised Trump for placing Bitcoin on a global scale through his ploy, with a user describing Trump as the ""ultimate crypto hype man.""Meanwhile, Trump noted during the Bitcoin conference in Nashville that the US must embrace crypto or China will dominate the industry. He stated that the Asian country is ""making too much progress"" with the nascent technology compared to America and could take over the sector if she didn't step up.China's Crypto StanceIn the meantime, China has banned crypto mining and trading in the country. The second-most populous nation in the world has had a hostile relationship with the nascent sector since 2013.China banned its financial institutions from carrying out crypto transactions in 2013. Four years later, it prohibited crypto projects from conducting initial coin offerings (ICOs), further bruising the sector's presence in the country.Notably, China ramped up its clampdown on the sector in 2019 when it went after crypto miners, terming the activity as highly polluting. The Asian nation finally stamped its utter intolerance for cryptocurrencies when it banned all mining and trading activities in 2021, preventing off-shore offerings and forcing firms to either relocate or shut down .However, despite the sector's ban in the state, China still reportedly controls 55% of the global mining pool, with the US holding 40%. This means mainland China has found a way to keep crypto activities thriving regardless of the government's stance.Meanwhile, China is considering relieving its ban on the sector following pressure from institutions to revisit its 2021 declaration.

Kusama has again requested a 10-minute discussion with Buterin, during which he plans to showcase SHIB’s potential to the Ethereum co-founder. His latest request comes days after he initially requested a 10-minute pitch on SHIB. Kusama Seeks to Explain ‘Why SHIB’ to Buterin For context, Buterin suggested in a recent interview that Dogecoin (DOGE) deserves to rank as the second or third-biggest crypto by market cap. As Buterin’s comments gained popularity, Kusama requested a 10-minute discussion, dubbed ‘Why SHIB.’Kusama hopes to utilize the opportunity to explain Shiba Inu’s potential, highlighting its technology, decentralized governance, and robust community, which could ultimately benefit Ethereum. He asked community members to call the Ethereum co-founder’s attention to the post. However, Buterin has yet to respond to the request. While the reason behind the delay is unknown, Buterin’s X activity shows that he has not been very active on the platform since November 1, when Kusama made the request. Shiba Inu Lead Asks Again Notably, he posted a tweet yesterday, calling the attention of his followers to his proposal on Ethereum’s plans. Interestingly, the Shiba Inu leader took to the comment section to inquire about when Buterin would hold a 10-minute discussion with him. “Wen 10-minute discussion?” the Shiba Inu leader quizzed.https://twitter.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1854448836153913550Again, Buterin has not responded to whether he would grant the request. Given Kusama’s determination, it is speculated that the Shiba Inu leader would not mind accepting any condition, including discussing it in person. However, this remains unconfirmed at press time.Nontheless, it is important to note that Kusama had previously held an in-person interview with Arabian Business magazine.Why Shiba Inu Enthusiasts Think Buterin Should Grant Kusama Request Meanwhile, most Shiba Inu enthusiasts are still calling on Buterin to have a 10-minute discussion with their ecosystem lead. Some reasons fueling their demands include Shiba Inu’s launch on Ethereum and the token’s massive growth rate. Shiba Inu is a major crypto project on the Ethereum blockchain. All Shiba Inu-related projects, including its blockchain and tokens, were deployed on Ethereum, attracting more users to the network. According to top developer Kaal Dhairya, Shiba Inu is the only top 10 ERC-20 token that has remained loyal to the network since its launch. The developer argued that other top 10 tokens like USDT and USDC are not part of this consideration due to their presence on multiple blockchains. Also, some users pointed to Shiba Inu’s lifetime growth rate as one major reason that Buterin should talk to Kusama. On October 30, the Shiba Inu leader claimed that Shiba Inu had registered a lifetime gain of 33,774,726%, making it the best-performing asset globally.",NEUTRAL,DOGE | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | SHIB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/shiba-inu-lead-and-ethereums-vitalik-buterin-is-a-10-minute-conversation-coming/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-lead-and-ethereums-vitalik-buterin-is-a-10-minute-conversation-coming,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
35918137,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100846,1731059072,"Investment Research Firm Says Shiba Inu Has Very Interesting Chart, Expects SHIB to Outpace Dogecoin in 2025","Sistine Research, an investment research firm, recently called Shiba Inu price action interesting while comparing it against the dollar and Dogecoin. The firm believes that Shiba Inu is gearing up to record substantial gains over the next year, potentially outpacing Dogecoin. This comes on the back of a sustained disappointing collapse from SHIB against Dogecoin since mid-October. SHIB/USD Support and Resistance LevelsThe SHIB/DOGE chart, which displays Shiba Inu’s performance against DOGE, reveals an important support and resistance structure.Data from the chart confirms that from mid-2021 to the present, SHIB/DOGE has traded within two important price ranges. The lower range, which sits between 0.00008 and 0.000105 DOGE, has served as a support zone. SHIB has repeatedly bounced off this level, showing strong buying interest around this area. Shiba Inu Daily Charts | Sistine Research For instance, Shiba Inu witnessed a price collapse from 0.0002024 DOGE to 0.0000841 DOGE by November 2022. However, the support at this level held firmly, allowing the bulls to hedge against any steeper declines. SHIB eventually recovered to 0.0001369 in February 2023.Since then, Shiba Inu has repeatedly retested this support range. This occurred mostly in 2023, particularly in mid-June, early July, and early December. It also occurred in late February this year. Each time, the bulls defended the support and stationed a rally.Meanwhile, above this support range lies a resistance zone between 0.00019 and 0.00023 DOGE. This level has acted as a ceiling for SHIB’s upward movements. Each time SHIB approached this upper band, selling pressure forced it back down, creating a substantial resistance barrier. The most recent instance saw SHIB drop massively after it soared to 0.0002349 DOGE in March.Shiba Inu Poised to Outpace Dogecoin At press time, Sistine Research’s chart shows that Shiba Inu has continued to retrace against Dogecoin following the March peak. It trades within the lower support range for the second time this year, especially with DOGE witnessing a massive uptick in the past few days.However, the investment research firm believes the support at this level could again trigger a massive Shiba Inu recovery. They expect this rally to push SHIB toward the upper resistance area, with a projected uptrend to 0.00019 DOGE. This target suggests a roughly 95% increase from the current trading range. It bears mentioning that when this pattern played out from late February to early March, the 0.0002349 DOGE top represented an impressive 110% rise within a week.Shiba Inu Potential to Hit $0.000043The second chart, which measures SHIB’s performance in USD, presents a similarly optimistic outlook. Unlike the SHIB/DOGE chart, this SHIB/USD chart has a long-standing support level around $0.000007.After hitting its $0.00008845 peak in late 2021, SHIB experienced a steep decline and then stabilized near its established support. Since early 2023, the price has remained within this range, showing low volatility. SHIB spiked to $0.000045 in March, coinciding with its upsurge against Dogecoin. However, it has since collapsed from this yearly peak.Sistine Research projects a dramatic move upwards.

Recent data shows that the BNB Chain experienced notable changes across various metrics in Q3 2024 despite facing market challenges. The chain saw a modest rise in Total Value Locked (TVL) and a significant increase in NFT trading activity. However, network revenue and overall on-chain activity declined compared to the previous quarter. BNB DeFi and Staking See Modest GainsBNB Smart Chain’s DeFi TVL, measured in USD, increased by 2% QoQ, rising from $4.74 billion in Q2 to $4.85 billion in Q3. Despite this growth, BNB Smart Chain slipped to fourth place in the TVL rankings, overtaken by Solana.Meanwhile, TVL denominated in BNB remained stable at 8.3 million BNB, indicating consistent capital inflows. Venus Finance retained its position as the leading protocol by TVL, with a 13% QoQ increase to $1.79 billion. However, borrowing on Venus dropped significantly by 36%, falling to $454 million. BNB DeFi TVL Staking activity also grew, with total BNB staked rising 7% to 32.4 million BNB. ListaDAO’s liquid staking solution, slisBNB, continued to dominate, though staked volumes fell 2% QoQ to 406,200 slisBNB. In a key development, the YieldNest protocol introduced a re-staking feature, allowing users to convert slisBNB into ynBNB for further staking. This move aims to boost ecosystem liquidity.BNB Chain Revenue DeclinesBNB Chain's revenue, which reflects the total fees collected by the network, declined in Q3. Revenue for the quarter totaled $34.9 million, a 28% decrease from $48.4 million in Q2.Revenue denominated in BNB also decreased, falling by 22% QoQ. In Q3, revenue amounted to 63,500 BNB, down from 81,300 BNB in the previous quarter.NFT Activity SurgesOn the NFT front, BNB Chain saw a significant rebound after a quiet Q2, with average daily trading volume soaring by 283% to $600,400 in Q3. Average daily sales also increased by 47%, reaching 8,900. BNB NFT Volumes However, the number of unique daily buyers fell by 53% to 2,300, suggesting that recent NFT activity was driven by larger transactions from a smaller pool of high-value traders. On-Chain Activity & Gas-Free InitiativeDespite positive momentum in some areas, BNB Smart Chain ’s on-chain activity slowed. Average daily transactions decreased 8% QoQ to 3.4 million, while active daily addresses dropped 19% to 868,300. Stablecoin transactions remained a strong point, with USDT leading in active addresses, averaging 294,000 daily—a growth of 8% QoQ. PancakeSwap remained the second most active protocol, with 94,600 daily addresses.Amid these trends, BNB Chain launched its “Gas-Free Carnival” to enhance stablecoin usage. This initiative offers gas-free transfers for USDT, USDC, and FDUSD, supported by Bitget Wallet and SafePal.

This partnership follows his 2022 plea deal with the Department of Justice (DoJ), aiming to improve transparency and combat fraud in the crypto market. Wang’s contributions include two key tools—one for detecting fraud in public markets and another for spotting illegal activities on crypto exchanges. Wang’s efforts to assist in fraud prevention highlight his attempt to atone for his role in FTX’s collapse, as he awaits sentencing on November 20. His lawyers argue that his deep remorse and extensive cooperation, including vital testimony against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried ( SBF ), should be considered in his sentencing. Wang revealed during the trial that SBF had allowed Alameda Research, his hedge fund, unrestricted access to FTX customer funds through a hidden “back door,” enabling millions in unauthorized transfers. This testimony was crucial in exposing the misuse of funds at FTX, and Wang’s collaboration has helped investigators understand FTX’s technical operations . Despite his cooperation, it remains unclear whether Wang will avoid jail. His case draws comparisons to Caroline Ellison, the former Alameda Research CEO, who provided testimony against SBF but received a two-year sentence. This suggests that cooperation, though important, doesn’t necessarily guarantee leniency in high-profile cases like FTX. Meanwhile, steps to compensate FTX victims are progressing. A US court recently approved a plan to distribute $14.7 billion to $16.5 billion to creditors, offering financial relief to those affected by FTX's collapse. However, some creditors are frustrated by delays in claim processing, particularly for larger claims that may take longer to resolve. Victims also worry that payouts based on FTX-era values could undervalue their assets, especially given recent increases in cryptocurrency prices since the exchange’s collapse. As Wang’s sentencing nears, his role in the government’s anti-fraud initiative and his assistance in the FTX case continue to shape his legal outlook. His attorneys hope his cooperation and remorse will lead to a lenient sentence, but the final decision rests with the court.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | OTHER | RESEARCH,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ex-ftx-cto-gary-wang-aids-us-fraud-fight-awaits-sentencing,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/35914155.jpeg

Bitcoin ETFs, like BlackRock's IBIT, are not leading the rally but are still benefiting significantly from the bullish sentiment. Bloomberg's ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, described the influx as a “Trump-inspired gusher of cash” hitting risk-on ETFs across the market. Although Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs aren’t the top gainers, they are enjoying notable increases in investments. Federal rate cuts could potentially dampen the mood for risk-on assets, but crypto ETFs are positioned to maintain their resilience due to the sector's unique dynamics. Balchunas highlighted that Thursday's activity was exceptional, with risk-on ETFs drawing in $22 billion in a single day —a figure typically seen over an entire week. This inflow has pushed the year-to-date net flows to $856 billion, edging closer to the annual record. Despite crypto ETFs not leading the rally, BlackRock's IBIT recorded impressive inflows of $1.12 billion on Thursday alone, with total spot Bitcoin ETFs hitting $1.38 billion that day. Other crypto-focused risk-on ETFs, such as the 2x Coinbase ETF (CONL), also posted remarkable gains, with CONL rising 62% in one day . These developments indicate a strong bullish trend for risk-on assets, even if crypto ETFs aren't dominating the performance charts. Analysts, including Todd Sohn, noted that this spike acts as a ""post-election release valve,"" indicating pent-up investor interest following the election. Although Bitcoin ETFs may not be among the biggest winners, the sector remains an attractive choice for risk-seeking investors, benefiting from the general upswing in the risk-on asset category.

Analysts expect heightened market activity as this event could prompt strategic year-end adjustments. A total of 48,794 Bitcoin options, valued around $3.7 billion, and 294,380 Ethereum options, worth $854 million, are expiring. Bitcoin’s maximum pain point—the price where most options expire worthless—is around $69,000, while Ethereum’s stands at $2,500. Maximum pain points are critical in options trading as they represent levels where options holders endure the greatest potential losses. Additionally, these metrics guide traders in gauging possible market movement since they indicate where the majority of options contracts would expire out of profit. The current put-to-call ratios for Bitcoin and Ethereum are 0.72 and 0.65, respectively, highlighting an optimistic market sentiment. A lower put-to-call ratio suggests that more traders are betting on price increases than declines, with recent market trends reflecting this sentiment. The post-election hype and speculation about potential outcomes influenced trading volumes, which surged to a record high of $10.8 billion. As interest around the election cooled, profit-taking has become more visible, with some traders winding down their positions after the election cycle. Market watchers observed that while both Bitcoin and Ethereum enjoyed recent price gains, implied volatility is now declining. This drop is notable as implied volatility often drives options pricing. Ethereum, in particular, has managed to retain gains better than Bitcoin as the market stabilizes. Meanwhile, the FOMC decision to lower interest rates by 0.25% is seen as a supportive move for markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that further rate hikes are not currently planned, acknowledging that many are still experiencing the impact of elevated prices. He also stated his intention to remain in his role, aware of former President Trump's ambitions to alter US crypto regulations beyond the SEC's oversight.

Notably, he expects this victory to affect the appeal timeline of the Ripple lawsuit. As reported earlier, Rispoli predicted that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit would issue its verdict for the case by 2026. Now, he believes a resolution would happen sooner following Trump’s victory. How Trump's Victory Changes Ripple Appeal Timeline Attorney Rispoli claimed that the U.S. president-elect is aware of the Ripple lawsuit through the X posts from the company’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty. It is worth noting that Alderoty was among the crypto stakeholders who made significant donations to Trump’s campaign. Specifically, the Ripple legal chief donated over $300,000 worth of XRP to Trump during his presidential campaign. Furthermore, Rispoli said there will be extreme changes in the SEC leadership by March or April 2025 following the emergence of the Trump-led administration. Given Trump’s victory and the potential SEC leadership overhaul, Attorney Rispoli forecasts that the Ripple lawsuit could be heading for a settlement, which he referred to as a ‘realistic possibility.’ 2 Scenarios for SEC v. Ripple Settlement Notably, he highlighted two scenarios for a potential settlement in the Ripple lawsuit under the current and upcoming SEC leadership. Settlement Under Existing SEC Leadership Following the recent developments in the U.S. election, Attorney Rispoli stated that a settlement is the best achievable outcome for the Ripple case under the current SEC leadership. According to him, the current leadership might quickly settle the Ripple lawsuit by accepting the conditions of the final verdict . The court imposed a $125 million fine against Ripple and a permanent injunction against the company’s future XRP institutional sales. Rispoli expects the SEC to make this move before the emergence of a new leadership, which might fully take effect by March or April 2025. Settlement Under New SEC Leadership For the second scenario, Rispoli expects that a new SEC leadership, potentially appointed in the spring of 2025, might reconsider the Ripple case from a less aggressive stance. Here, the expert projected that the new SEC leadership will consider the case to be ‘idiotic.’ As a result, the securities regulator might settle for a lesser amount than the current administration will accept. Additionally, Rispoli forecasted that part of the settlement terms would structure Ripple’s future XRP sales to institutional clients to ensure they do not constitute investment contracts. In conclusion, Rispoli nullified his previous prediction that the Ripple appeal would be resolved by 2026. He currently believes a potential settlement is a realistic possibility for the Ripple lawsuit, which could see the company settle on stringent terms under the existing leadership or better conditions under a crypto-friendly administration.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/heres-how-donald-trumps-win-changes-ripple-v-sec-appeal-timeline-expert/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-donald-trumps-win-changes-ripple-v-sec-appeal-timeline-expert,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The Crypto Basic recently called attention to seven of Trump’s top campaign promises. Trump pledged to remove SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose tough stance on crypto has drawn criticism. He also proposed creating a National Bitcoin Reserve, suggesting that Bitcoin could be used to reduce the U.S. national debt. To further boost the crypto sector, Trump promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world with pro-business regulations.In addition, Trump plans to ensure that all remaining Bitcoin is mined in the U.S., securing the country’s leadership in the sector. He also committed to introducing clear, fair crypto regulations and establishing a crypto advisory council to guide policy. Another key promise is to defend the right to self-custody, allowing Americans to control their crypto assets without third-party platforms.Finally, Trump expressed his opposition to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), promising to block their development to protect financial privacy.These promises signal potential major changes for the U.S. crypto industry once Trump takes office on January 20, 2025.Tron Founder Taps China for Similar Pro-Crypto MovesIn line with these developments, Justin Sun has also called for similar pro-crypto moves from other major economies like China.

In the wake of Trump's win , the incumbent Securities and Exchange Commission chair, Gensler, is under scrutiny. His over 100 legal actions against crypto firms and an incessant clampdown on the industry made him one of the bargaining chips in the industry's support for the US president-elect.Furthermore, Trump pledged to fire Gensler on his first day in office, among promises the 47th US president made.

The Thursday report shows that Gallagher made the short list of candidates considered to head the regulatory agency next year.Gallagher was an SEC commissioner for four years before leaving for the Robinhood position. The CLO, who has witnessed Gensler's iron-handed leadership firsthand, is the preferred choice among crypto leaders, the people familiar with the issue noted.Meanwhile, the report also shows that Paul Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Global Partners, is among the options. The former SEC commissioner, who was also part of Trump's transitioning team in 2016, is also a strong candidate to replace Gensler.Meanwhile, another candidate for the job, Hester Peirce, aka Crypto Mum, squashed speculations of her replacing Gensler. The strong crypto proponent and current Republican SEC commissioner has allegedly told people close to her that she has no interest in assuming the chair office.Gensler Set to Resign?With Trump's win, Gensler's term, which should run till 2026, is allegedly under immense uncertainty. Industry leaders have asked Trump to keep his promises and sack the SEC boss after resuming power.However, Gensler noted that he remains focused on doing ""that which we do well at the SEC"" until the next administration decides his future. Notably, the SEC chair allegedly fell out with both the Republican and Democratic parties and may have faced a similar scenario had Kamala Harris won.Meanwhile, Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal seems to have lived past the Gensler era when he urged the SEC to change its regulatory standards for the crypto sector.

35911660,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100877,1731054938,Solana Price Soars to $201 as TVL Hits $6.855B: Is a New 52-Week High Approaching?,"Solana (SOL) recaptures the $200 level as the bull run prolongs. Will a new breakout rally result in an extension to $250? The Solana bull run continues as it becomes the fourth-biggest crypto in the world. With a market cap of $93.29B, the recovery run in Solana now hits the $200 psychological mark. As the bull run teases a new rally above the $200 psychological mark, will the uptrend hit $250? Let’s find out!Solana (SOL) Price AnalysisAfter briefly surpassing $200 with a 24-hour high of $201.19, Solana has pulled back to a current price of $197.67. The bullish recovery in Solana now accounts for four consecutive bullish candles and a price jump of 26.39%. Solana Price Chart The recovery rally extends from a 7-day low of $155.01 to the current market price. The post-retest reversal of an inverted head and shoulder breakout rally is now aiming for a new 52-week high. The post-retest reversal also took support from the 50% Fibonacci level at $159.54. Currently, it is challenging the 100% Fibonacci level at $201.69 in attempts for a refreshed breakout rally. Key technical indicators support this positive outlook: the MACD and signal lines have produced a bullish crossover, suggesting a strong likelihood of further upward movement. Additionally, the 50-day and 200-day SMA lines have confirmed a ""golden crossover,"" a bullish sign.However, the 100-day SMA line remains below the 200-day SMA. This marks a medium-term perception for Solana that has yet to change. Solana Price TargetsLooking at Fibonacci retracement levels, potential upside targets for the breakout rally lie at the 1.272 and 1.618 Fibonacci extensions, corresponding to prices of $224 and $253, respectively. This increases the likelihood of Solana achieving a new 52-week high.On the flip side, the crucial support for the SOL price is now the 78.60% Fibonacci level at $183.65. In case of a bullish failure with a broader market cool-down, it could result in a potential retest for a new higher-low formation. As a healthy retest, this will increase the chances of an uptrend in Solana. Solana Network Hits $6.855 TVLWith the rising demand for the SOL token, the Solana network is also experiencing massive growth. The total value locked over the Solana network has now reached $6.855 billion as it inches closer to the 52-week high of $7.248 billion. Solana TVL The total fees collected over the Solana network in the past 24 hours have reached $3.67 million, with a revenue of $1.83 million. Hence, with improving DeFi numbers, the Solana network continues to grow and will likely boost the market demand for the SOL token.",POSITIVE,SOL,BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/solana-price-soars-to-201-as-tvl-hits-6-855b-is-a-new-52-week-high-approaching/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=solana-price-soars-to-201-as-tvl-hits-6-855b-is-a-new-52-week-high-approaching,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Ethereum Begins To Regain Momentum The second-largest cryptocurrency by reported market cap has lagged behind Bitcoin (BTC) and other smart contract platform tokens like Solana (SOL) for much of the year. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Shares Correlation With S&P500 – Last Dip Before It Hits $10,000? However, following Trump’s win as Republican US presidential candidate, ETH has witnessed a rise of over 10% since yesterday. The token’s rise has brought attention to one of Ethereum’s most innovative use cases to date – DeFi. In a long-form post on X, Arthur Arthur Cheong & Eugene Yap from crypto investment firm DeFiance Capital noted that total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols is rebounding. While the analysts credit some of this growth to higher crypto asset prices, they also highlight that trading volumes on some DeFi platforms have “nearly recovered to 2022 levels, proving the resurgence is real.” Cheong and Yap outline several factors that indicate the DeFi ecosystem is heading toward the era of “DeFi renaissance.” First, the analysts note that DeFi appears to be emerging from the “trough of disillusionment.” For the uninitiated, disillusionment is a phase in the Gartner Hype Cycle when interest in a technology wanes as initial expectations are unmet. As shown in the chart below, DeFi is moving through the “slope of enlightenment” phase, likely headed for the “plateau of productivity” as the technology matures. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, including a low interest-rate environment, are expected to boost DeFi adoption in two critical ways: reducing opportunity costs and making loans more affordable. With treasury bills and traditional savings accounts offering minimal returns, investors increasingly turn to income-generating DeFi strategies like yield farming, staking, and liquidity mining. Lower interest rates are also likely to increase the supply of stablecoins by making loans cheaper, thereby providing additional liquidity to drive DeFi growth. How Is Trump Presidency Bullish For ETH? The analysis emphasizes that the 2024 US presidential elections can offer DeFi much required regulatory clarity. Trump’s presidency is anticipated to bring more favorable crypto regulations, which could boost investor confidence. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-To-Reward Ratio Is ‘Too Good To Pass Up’ – Top Analyst Sets $6,000 Target Consequently, ETH is expected to benefit from any increase in investor interest in DeFi. Analysis by crypto experts suggests that ETH could rise to $3,400 if it clears certain key resistance levels. There has also been a significant increase in Ethereum whale activity, indicating that sophisticated and seasoned ETH holders are accumulating the token in anticipation of a potential rally. ETH faces stiff competition from rival smart contract platforms such as Solana. According to a recent report, the SOL DeFi ecosystem saw its TVL increase to $5.7 billion in Q3 2024. At press time, ETH trades at $2,806, up 7.1% in the past 24 hours, with a total market cap of $338.6 billion.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Pointing At ‘Extreme Greed’ The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment among the traders in the Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency sectors. This index represents the sentiment as a score between zero and hundred. To calculate the score, the metric uses data from the following five factors: volatility, trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. When the indicator’s value is greater than 53, it means the investors share a sentiment of greed right now. On the other hand, the metric being below 47 suggests the market is currently observing fear. Naturally, the index between these two regions implies a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Dogecoin Descending Triangle Could Hint At Next Destination For DOGE Besides these three core sentiments, there are two special zones: extreme greed and fear. The former occurs at values above 75, while the latter is under 25. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is like right now: As is visible above, the indicator is at a value of 77, which suggests the traders in the sector are currently holding a sentiment of extreme greed. This is a change from yesterday when the market was still inside the normal greed region. Here is a chart that shows how the index’s value has changed over the past year: Historically, the extreme sentiments have proven significant for Bitcoin, as major price tops and bottoms in the asset have tended to occur inside these zones. Thus, the relationship between sentiment and price has been an inverse one, however, meaning that extreme greed has led to tops, while extreme fear has paved the way for bottoms. From the above graph, it’s apparent that the Fear & Greed Index had surged high into the extreme greed territory when Bitcoin had topped out in the first quarter of this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Records $75,000 All-Time High: Here’s If BTC Is ‘Overheated’ Now It’s possible that, with the market once again becoming too hyped about the cryptocurrency after the latest all-time high (ATH) break, another top could form for BTC. Generally, however, major tops only occur when the index hits particularly high levels. The top above, for instance, took place alongside a value of 88. Thus, it’s possible that sentiment could still have room to heat up, before the rally hits a major obstacle. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $75,900, up 8% over the last seven days.

35911659,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100888,1731053431,Raoul Pal States 2 Reasons Trump’s Election Victory Could Help Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin,"Raoul Pal, market veteran and CEO of Real Vision, recently expressed his belief that the Donald Trump victory could help Ethereum outperform Bitcoin. His commentary follows a period in which Ethereum has trailed Bitcoin , marking five straight months of losses against BTC since mid-2024. Currently, ETH trades at 0.03829 BTC, down approximately 29% year-to-date against Bitcoin.Bitcoin has shown a better performance since Q3 2023. However, Ethereum appears to be gaining ground in recent times, having increased 7.06% against Bitcoin in November. This recovery comes despite Bitcoin’s recent spike to a new ATH . In a post earlier this morning, Pal suggested that he sees Trump’s victory as an opportunity for Ethereum to shift the trend to its favor. He identified two key reasons this new administration could allow Ethereum to begin outpacing Bitcoin.Ethereum Could Leverage Yield in DeFiThe first reason is the potential for utility tokens in DeFi to begin offering yield or rewards based on the underlying network. According to Pal, the new regulatory environment could enable more yield opportunities within Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem .As Ethereum has the largest share of DeFi applications, it stands to gain more than other blockchains if regulatory clarity permits these financial innovations to flourish. This is likely to enhance its network value and price growth, allowing it to outpace Bitcoin.Ethereum as the Preferred Blockchain for TradFiThe second factor is Ethereum’s established position as a reliable and widely adopted blockchain, which could make it the platform of choice for traditional finance (TradFi) institutions looking to build out larger blockchain-based applications. With Trump’s election likely bringing a shift toward pro-crypto regulations, Pal expects Ethereum to serve as the backbone for TradFi projects seeking a tested and scalable network. He likens Ethereum’s position to that of Microsoft in the early days of web enterprise solutions, noting that Ethereum has the familiarity and credibility to present itself as the “safe” choice for institutions exploring blockchain integration.While Pal is optimistic, he admits Ethereum might not be the biggest beneficiary of the new Trump administration. Competing blockchains like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) are gaining traction, especially among users seeking lower fees. Pal argued that Ethereum could underperform against a newer project like SUI, which is in an early, high-growth phase. He also admitted that Solana is also in a better position to outperform Ethereum.“Trump’s Victory Might Benefit Altcoins More”Market analysts like Bitwise’s Matt Hougan and pundit Alex Kruger have shared similar thoughts on regulatory clarity, noting that while Bitcoin enjoyed some regulatory assurance under the Biden administration, Ethereum and other altcoins faced more uncertainty. Trump’s victory could create a more favorable environment for these altcoins. This change might allow institutions, that were once wary of altcoins due to potential regulatory implications, to decide to enter the market when there is sufficient clarity.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/raoul-pal-states-2-reasons-trumps-election-victory-could-help-ethereum-outperform-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=raoul-pal-states-2-reasons-trumps-election-victory-could-help-ethereum-outperform-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42435198,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLRzf,1731048856,Is $90K Bitcoin's Next Big Test? Trendline Analysis Reveals Insights Amid SOL/BTC Breakout: Godbole,"Trendline drawn off BTC's April and November 2021 highs signals resistance at around $90,000.  SOL's BTC-denominated price (SOL/ BTC) looks north.  After months of struggle, bitcoin {{BTC}} bulls have finally managed to chew through the breakout level of $70,000 this week, setting new record highs above $76,000.  With BTC in a price discovery mode on pro-crypto Donald Trump's return to the White House, the most pressing question for traders is: What's the next resistance level that could challenge the bulls?  One of the straightforward ways to identify such a level is to examine the price chart. For instance, by drawing a trendline off the April 2021 peak of $64,898 and the November 2021 high of around $69,000 and extending it forward, we can see that the resistance lies around $90,000.  Trendlines are a staple in technical analysis, helping traders identify the broader trend and potential support and resistance levels. In bitcoin's case, the upward-sloping trendline drawn from previous peaks can act as a target for potential sell orders or profit-taking, becoming a speculative resistance. Convergence of traders' actions could slow the ascent if and when the price nears $90,000.  The latest move above $70,000, representing the unspooling of the prolonged consolidative pattern, indicates that the broader uptrend from the October 2023 lows has resumed.  The breakout and a renewed positive flip in the MACD histogram, implying a strengthening of bullish momentum, suggest that the resistance at $90,000 could be tested soon.  A move below the weekly low of $66,824 would invalidate the bullish technical outlook.  Note that the activity in the options market suggests potential resistance at $80,000 and $100,000.  SOL/BTC breakout  Hopes for regulatory relief under Trump's presidency have led to bigger gains in alternative cryptocurrencies such as Solana's SOL token.  Particularly noteworthy is SOL's BTC-denominated price (SOL/BTC), which has risen nearly 11% this week, hinting at a potential bullish resolution to months of tedious rangebound activity.  A breakout from the triangular consolidation, represented by converging trendlines, would mean bulls are finally willing to lead the price action and open doors for a move toward 2021 highs. The weekly candle must close Sunday (UTC) above the upper trendline to confirm the breakout.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/08/is-90k-bitcoins-next-big-test-trendline-analysis-reveals-insights-amid-solbtc-breakout-godbole,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7082c0bc8a09a5527ac657aa14cf9beac27d71a7-4096x2304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a tweet , Garlinghouse acknowledged the challenges Ripple and XRP have faced over the years, particularly due to the actions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which initiated a lawsuit against Ripple nearly four years ago.According to Garlinghouse, the SEC’s entanglement with the crypto industry over the past six years have been “unnatural and manipulative,” with the four-year-old lawsuit effectively acting as headwinds that suppressed XRP’s growth. Tides Now Shifting for XRP, Future for XRP Is EnormousHowever, with the incoming Trump administration, Ripple’s CEO believes these headwinds are beginning to turn into tailwinds, opening up opportunities for XRP’s resurgence in the digital asset market.Trump’s administration has indicated intentions to adopt a more crypto-friendly stance, with Trump himself promising to position the U.S. as a global crypto leader. His proposed crypto policies include creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler.For XRP, Garlinghouse suggests this shift in regulatory attitudes could finally clear the path for growth and greater adoption.Reflecting on XRP’s history, the Ripple CEO noted that the digital asset was once the second most valuable in the market. Notably, this was in January 2018, when XRP traded at an all-time high. However, XRP has tanked by nearly 90% since then, with its present value at $0.5506.Meanwhile, Garlinghouse's remarks suggested confidence that XRP could regain a similar standing in the crypto scene. His message to the XRP community underscored a sense of resilience and optimism, reinforcing his belief that the asset’s future is “enormous.”https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1854633035888505132In his congratulatory note to Donald Trump on his victory at the polls on Tuesday, Garlinghouse urged Trump to quickly implement his campaign promise of firing Gary Gensler on the first day in office and called on him to provide clarity for Ethereum, just as XRP has received.XRP Army Delighted by Promising FutureAs industry pundits expect regulatory pressures on cryptocurrencies to ease with the Trump presidency, Garlinghouse’s comments point to a new chapter for XRP that could see it thrive in a more supportive environment.Members of the XRP community have recognized Garlinghouse’s message, expressing optimism that 2025 “feels like a new beginning for XRP.”",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/ripple-ceo-says-tides-are-shifting-for-xrp-future-for-xrp-is-enormous/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ripple-ceo-says-tides-are-shifting-for-xrp-future-for-xrp-is-enormous,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35908794,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100844,1731047237,Top Lawyer Reveals What Happens to Ripple v. SEC Case Under New US Administration,"Pro-XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan believes there could be significant changes in the SEC cases against crypto-related companies, including Ripple. Crypto enthusiasts speculate how Donald Trump’s emergence as the U.S. president-elect might impact the broader crypto industry. During his campaign, Trump promised to implement several pro-crypto actions that could make the United States a global crypto leader. Some of his promises include firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler and supporting favorable crypto policies. However, he did not comment on the existing SEC-filed legal cases against crypto companies like Ripple. Hogan Reveals the Fate of Crypto Cases Under New SEC Chair Consequently, crypto community members, especially XRP holders, sought the opinion of legal experts regarding how Trump’s victory might impact the SEC lawsuits against Ripple and other crypto firms next year. Responding to the inquiry, Attorney Hogan highlighted events that could lead to dismissing or settling all SEC-filed lawsuits against crypto firms by next year. He made the speculation after listening to former SEC official John Reed Stark’s opinion on an X Spaces session. Attorney Hogan projects that Gensler will step down as SEC Chair before Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Following his departure, the pro-XRP lawyer expects the Trump administration to appoint a pro-crypto interim head for the SEC. He said the new SEC chair would order the resolution of all non-fraud crypto cases, including the Ripple lawsuit. The lawyer speculates that the SEC would heed this directive, assess all non-fraud crypto cases, and recommend a settlement or outright dismissal. The assessment team will then submit the recommendation to the Republican-led SEC commissioners, who will vote on whether to dismiss or settle the lawsuits. Interestingly, Hogan forecasts that the SEC will approve the recommendation with three ‘yay’ from the Republican commissioners. SEC to Settle Ripple Case He forecasts that the SEC will settle the Ripple case or any other non-fraud crypto lawsuit with a ruling. Specifically, he expects Ripple to pay the judgment amount of $125 million to settle with the SEC. It is worth mentioning that a federal judge ordered Ripple to pay a fine of $125 million for violating federal securities laws through its institutional sales of XRP. Although the company had made preparations to pay the fine, the SEC appealed the Ripple decision, especially the parts it lost like programmatic sales and other distributions, stalling the payment. With the SEC expected to get a new leadership under Trump’s administration, Attorney Hogan believes the commission will settle the Ripple lawsuit for the judgment amount of $125 million. The lawyer forecasts that the SEC will dismiss the other cases still in litigation, including the Coinbase lawsuit. Meanwhile, Attorney Hogan projects that the settlement and dismissal of crypto-related cases will not happen in January but before the summer of 2025.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/top-lawyer-reveals-what-happens-to-ripple-v-sec-case-under-new-us-administration/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-lawyer-reveals-what-happens-to-ripple-v-sec-case-under-new-us-administration,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

35903335,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652107,1731043821,$13 Million Bitcoin? Sounds ‘Bearish’: Expert Hints At Even Greater Heights Ahead,"The recent presidential election has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin prices reacting positively to Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris. As Trump prepares to take office for a second term, his ongoing commitment to making the United States the “crypto capital of the world” has ignited bullish sentiment among investors, positioning Bitcoin at the center of his economic proposals. ‘$13 Million Bitcoin Price Target Is Bearish’ Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund has been vocal about the implications of Trump’s win for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. In a series of posts on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Porter highlighted the potential for Bitcoin to experience significant price discoveries in the coming years. He emphasized that the election outcome signals a substantial shift in the political landscape regarding cryptocurrency. Porter stated that after the 2024 presidential election, it is “abundantly clear” that Bitcoin is a “winning issue,” claiming that opposing Bitcoin support is “political suicide,” with a forecast that the United States will lead on BTC. The Satoshi Act Fund CEO believes that as the global community comes to terms with this reality, a “dramatic” acceleration in Bitcoin adoption will follow. Related Reading: CNBC Projects Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 Before Presidential Inauguration – Details In addition to Trump’s victory, the Republican Party has secured a majority in Congress, further enhancing the prospects for cryptocurrency legislation. Porter noted that over 250 members of Congress are now pro-Bitcoin, which could facilitate a more favorable regulatory environment for the crypto market to thrive. This newfound political support could lead to legislation clarifying regulations and encouraging innovation and investment in the digital asset sector. It could also pave the way for the approval and introduction of one of Trump’s key promises: to make BTC a strategic reserve asset for the country. One of Porter’s most striking comments came just 24 hours after the election when he suggested a forecast of $13 million per Bitcoin could be considered bearish. “Expect the unexpected,” he said, hinting at the possibility of even higher valuations for Bitcoin shortly. Extended Bull Run For BTC? In an update on social media, market expert Rekt Capital provided insights into BTC’s short-term price action. He highlighted the importance of a weekly candle close above $71,500, which could signal the start of a breakout from the current re-accumulation range. Rekt Capital notes that Bitcoin has been in a prolonged re-accumulation phase for over 200 days since the last Halving event, which occurred earlier this year in April. The expert points out that the historical trend suggests bullish sentiment, as Bitcoin’s cycle has dramatically reduced from an average of 260 days to just 13 days in the current post-Halving context. This reduction in cycle duration indicates that Bitcoin is in a slightly accelerated phase compared to previous cycles. However, the current rate of acceleration is not as steep as earlier in the year, particularly in March 2024, suggesting a stabilizing trend. Due to this extended consolidation period, Bitcoin has almost completely realigned with historical Halving cycles. Rekt believes this resynchronization could lead to a longer, more robust bull run than anticipated. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Rallies 10%: Will Bulls Push It Higher? In a related analysis, crypto analyst Ali Martinez speculates on the potential timing of the next market peak for Bitcoin. He highlights a historical pattern wherein Bitcoin typically reaches market tops 8 to 12 months after achieving a monthly close above its previous all-time high. Ali Martinez predicts that the next significant market top for the leading crypto could occur between July and November 2025 if this pattern holds. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $75,100.

35905314,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100832,1731042590,Here’s How Much 1 Shiba Inu Can be Worth if SHIB Reaches a $100B Market Cap,"Shiba Inu could witness a massive 796% spike in its price if its market cap grew from the current figure to claim the $100 billion mark. The broader crypto market is on a recovery charge that saw Bitcoin (BTC), the industry’s firstborn, claim a new all-time peak above $76,000. While altcoins such as Shiba Inu have joined in this rebound campaign, they remain below their highs from the previous cycle.SHIB Remains Below ATHFor instance, SHIB reached an all-time high of $0.00008845 during the last bull market in 2021. However, it has not decisively come close to reclaiming this level in the ongoing bull cycle, much less surpassing it.Shiba Inu’s peak for this bull run is $0.00004567, a level it attained in early March. Since dropping from this price point, the meme coin sensation has failed to recover it. Most analysts believe a reclamation of this local top could prepare the groundwork for a greater push toward the ATH at $0.00008845.However, despite its current price of 366%, which is away from the $0.00008845 peak, analysts and investors remain confident in Shiba Inu’s potential. As a result, multiple bullish predictions have engulfed the Shiba Inu community. Price of 1 Shiba Inu at a $100B Market CapWhile some expect rallies to $0.000081 during this cycle, others have made more ambitious projections. Notably, some analysts like Jake Gagain expect Shiba Inu to eventually reach a $100 billion market cap , positioning it as the first meme coin to achieve this feat.For context, Shiba Inu’s all-time high market cap is $39 billion, a valuation it claimed during the 2021 bull run. At press time, Shiba Inu has a market cap of $11.2 billion, making it the 12th-largest cryptocurrency and the second-largest meme coin.Despite projections of a potential rise in valuation to $100 billion, many remain oblivious to the price implications of this market cap. Consequently, we employed the services of a market resource, The Coin Perspective, to highlight what price SHIB would trade at the $100 billion valuation mark. Data from the platform confirms that at a $100 billion market cap, Shiba Inu's price will have reached $0.00017. This potential price level would mark a massive 796% increase from the current price. Interestingly, during the initial run this year, SHIB secured an impressive 379% rally from Feb. 24 to March 5, spiking from $0.00000952 to $0.00004568. The meme coin’s ability to secure such an upward push in less than ten days confirmed its potential.As a result, some believe Shiba Inu can engineer a more substantial rally, especially when the altcoin season comes. Currently trading for $0.00001897, if Shiba Inu secures an 800% rise from this level, its price would rise to $0.00001707, taking it to the $100 billion market cap.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SHIB,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/heres-how-much-1-shiba-inu-can-be-worth-if-shib-reaches-a-100b-market-cap/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-much-1-shiba-inu-can-be-worth-if-shib-reaches-a-100b-market-cap,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The price is consolidating gains and might aim for a fresh increase above the $605 level. BNB price started a downside correction from the $612 resistance zone. The price is now trading above $590 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $595 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $588 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Holds Support After a close above the $585 level, BNB price extended its increase. However, upsides were limited above $610 and the price remained capped unlike Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $605 and $600 levels. The price even dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $543 swing low to the $611 high. However, the price is now holding gains above the $580 level. The price is now trading above $595 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $595 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $605 level. The next resistance sits near the $612 level. A clear move above the $612 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $620. A close above the $620 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $632 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $650 level in the near term. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $595 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $578 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $543 swing low to the $611 high. The main support sits at $570. If there is a downside break below the $570 support, the price could drop toward the $560 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $550 level.

Shiba Inu is one of the most successful cryptocurrencies in this decade. The meme coin recorded massive rallies during the previous bull run, outperforming the rest of the market, and has continued to retain its relevance by maintaining a spot among the top 15 crypto assets.Shiba Inu Historical SuccessDue to its meme coin origins, industry leaders like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expected an imminent collapse three years ago . However, SHIB has grown to surpass these expectations, performing better than most believed.While Shiba Inu spiked to a new all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021, it has since dropped from this peak. Now trading for $0.00001896, SHIB is down 80% from its all-time high. However, this is largely due to the condition in the broader market rather than Shiba Inu’s unique struggles.Nonetheless, during downturns like this, most investors regret their choice to hold their bags through an asset’s all-time high. For instance, a Shiba Inu investment worth $1 million at the $0.00008845 peak would have dropped to $191K at the current price, down by over $800K.Despite this, data confirms that modest investments in Shiba Inu at its early stage still boast substantial returns today. According to CoinMarketCap, at the current $0.00001895 price, Shiba Inu is up 1,266,695.29% from its initial price. This translates to an initial price of $0.000000001334.Returns on $10, $100, or $1,000 Invested in Shiba Inu at $0.000000001334.We recently assessed how much an investor would hold currently if he invested varying amounts, such as $10, $100, and $1,000, in Shiba Inu at the initial trading price of $0.000000001334.Specifically, if an investor purchased $10 worth of SHIB at $0.000000001334 per token in August 2020, this individual would have 7.496 billion tokens. At the current price of $$0.00001896, this initial $10 investment would still be worth $126,761, representing returns of over $126K.Further, a $100 investment in Shiba Inu during its early stages would have claimed 74.96 billion SHIB tokens. Remarkably, the 74.96 billion tokens currently have a worth of $1.267 million at the prevalent price. This translates to returns of over $1.26 million from a meager $100 investment.Meanwhile, if an investor had thrown $1,000 into Shiba Inu at its initial price, he would have 749.6 billion tokens. Notably, such an investment would be valued at $12.67 million at the current price of $0.00001896.This assessment confirms the assertion that Shiba Inu is one of the most successful crypto assets in recent times. The token has outperformed nearly every asset in the top 100 list since 2020. This success has triggered optimism of a similar run in the future.

35899446,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652105,1731038425,Binance Hits $8.3B Open Interest High—Here’s What It Signals For the Crypto Market,"Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has achieved a new milestone as its open interest (OI) surged to an all-time high (ATH) of $8.3 billion, according to a report by CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci. This increase, representing a 10.24% growth over the past 24 hours, emphasizes Binance’s substantial share of global crypto futures positions. The surge in OI also highlights Binance’s influence on market trends, given that it now accounts for roughly 35% of all open futures positions across all exchanges globally. The total OI across exchanges, including Binance, reached $23.3 billion, setting a record in the sector, Kesmeci reveals. Implications Of Binance High Open Interest To understand what the increase in Binance open interest means for the crypto market, it is worth first looking into what the term ‘open interest’ means. Notably, open interest (OI) refers to the total number of outstanding contracts in the futures market, encompassing both long and short positions. A rise in this metric often suggests increased trading activity and interest, making it a crucial indicator for market participants. Binance OI Reaches New ATH of $8.3 Billion “Open Interest across all exchanges—including Binance—stands at $23.3 billion, marking a new ATH. This means Binance alone accounts for around 35% of all global futures positions.” – By @burak_kesmeci Link 👇https://t.co/zfnGiGUtKL pic.twitter.com/DfWbZH3tfN — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 6, 2024 Kesmeci explained that a significant jump in open interest such as that of Binance—particularly when it exceeds a 3% increase within a 24-hour period—frequently precedes heightened market volatility and potential liquidations. This means that both bullish and bearish positions could come under increased pressure as market dynamics shift, creating potential for major moves across the crypto landscape. The CryptoQuant analyst particularly wrote: Remember, the OI metric represents the total number of open long and short positions in the market. Sharp increases in OI suggest that, as volatility spikes, both long and short positions could face increased pressure, potentially leading to liquidations. BNB’s Price Movement Amid Broader Market Trends Binance’s native token BNB, has also experienced a notable price movement, mirroring the broader uptrend within the crypto market led by Bitcoin’s resurgence.

35905310,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=100777,1731036904,Top Analyst Says No Surprise if XRP Hits $4 as it Pumps to 5-Week High,"Amid XRP’s latest comeback, a widely followed analyst has suggested the asset could be headed for an all-time high in the $4 range. XRP is finally joining the Bitcoin-led bull trend, setting a fresh monthly high as BTC enters unprecedented price territories. Earlier today, XRP reached $0.5740, marking an 11.67% increase from the $0.514 level it traded at yesterday.Notably, $0.5740 is the highest price XRP has reached in about five weeks. During this period, Bitcoin surpassed its March peak of $73,750 and established a new high at $76,400. Given that XRP has ultimately capitalized on the market-wide upsurge, ""CoinsKid,"" a crypto trader with 140K followers on X, pondered whether the ongoing XRP rally could drive the altcoin to an all-time high.XRP Rallying to ATH at $4 Would Be No SurpriseThe analyst shared a two-year historical XRP chart on the weekly time frame. The chart identified three major resistance points for XRP, with the most crucial being at the $0.94 level. Notably, XRP lost its bullish momentum at this level in July 2023, during the frenzy that followed the court verdict declaring it is not a security.Other key points identified are psychological thresholds at $1.50 and $2.50. In addition to these resistance levels, CoinsKid also pointed to a now robust support at $0.3798 and a potential price discovery level at $4. According to the seasoned trader, it would be no surprise if XRP held firm on the support without needing a retest and broke through the $0.94 resistance, continuing upwards until it set a peak at $4.044.Notably, for XRP to surpass the $0.94 level, it would need to stage a run that drives its value up by 71% from the current price of $0.55. However, this magnitude of growth has been a major hurdle for XRP in recent times. Meanwhile, for the price discovery phase at $4, XRP would require a much stronger surge of 627%.The Bullish Narrative for XRPA major narrative currently fueling a bullish perspective for XRP is the anticipation of Donald Trump dismissing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Responding to CoinsKid, an investor noted that XRP can no longer revisit the support level at $0.37, arguing that the opportunity to buy at that low price was weeks ago. The commenter further suggested that, now that pro-crypto Trump has won the election, Gensler's sack will ""send XRP’s price soaring.""In response, another proponent pointed out that XRP barely saw a 4% pump on the day Bitcoin first peaked at $75K after Trump’s victory, implying that the narrative suggesting an XRP rally due to Gensler's dismissal might be weak.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/08/top-analyst-says-no-surprise-if-xrp-hits-4-as-it-pumps-to-5-week-high/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-says-no-surprise-if-xrp-hits-4-as-it-pumps-to-5-week-high,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Launching on Fuel Network, the project aims to provide solutions for some of the limitations in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape and offer traders fast, secure, and transparent trading with minimized state and reduced storage. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Looks ‘More Bullish Than Before’ After Flipping BNB As 4th Largest Crypto Spark Brings First On-Chain Oder Books To The Ethereum Ecosystem Decentralized trading protocol Spark is launching the Ethereum ecosystem’s first fully on-chain order book, seeking to offer traders a “secure, efficient, and decentralized” experience. Per the announcement, the state-minimized order book will move execution fully on-chain to enhance transparency. Moreover, it’s set to reduce data storage and processing needs to ensure faster transactions without compromising security. The Ethereum L2 project aims to address the limitations of Automated Market Makers (AMMS) and Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). Despite being instrumental in DeFi’s growth, AMMs struggle to meet the “advanced demands of institutional traders in high-frequency and algorithmic trading.” Meanwhile, CEXs have been criticized for the lack of transparency and control expected in decentralized systems. The project argues that DeFi needs to use traditional trading mechanisms to attract institutional traders. As a result, Spark will introduce Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs) to tackle these limitations. CLOBs are trading mechanisms used in traditional stock markets to match all bids and offers according to time priority and price. With this implementation, Spark is set to provide better price discovery, faster execution, and deeper liquidity while maintaining security and transparency. Additionally, it seeks to offer “the precision and capabilities necessary for professional and institutional traders.” Vitali Dervoed, Spark’s CEO and co-founder, highlighted the importance of order books for institutional and retail traders who seek accuracy and transparency while controlling their assets: Order books are the backbone of professional, institutional, and advanced retail traders who rely on precise execution and transparency. Spark’s shift to on-chain trading represents a significant leap in eliminating the trade-offs associated with off-chain systems. With full visibility into order depth and liquidity, users are protected from risks like front-running and manipulation while enjoying the security of self-custody. Unlike centralized exchanges, Spark ensures users have complete control over their assets, making it an ideal platform for traders prioritizing security, transparency, and efficiency. A ‘New Era’ For Decentralized Trading? Launched in October, Fuel is a modular rollup operating system designed for Ethereum. After three weeks, it achieved a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $33.5 million. According to data from DeFiLlama, Fuel saw a 700% TVL increase in one day, followed by a 1200% weekly increase. Spark is one of the first dApps in the Fuel Network. The Ethereum Layer 2 project is powered by Fuel’s modular architecture, aiming to “push DeFi closer to mainstream adoption” with speed, scalability, and interoperability. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Gearing Up For Massive Bullish Wave Following 8% Daily Surge, 110% Rally Ahead? The projects look to build a “new era for decentralized trading” that unlocks “new possibilities for institutional-grade DeFi” and evolves the Ethereum landscape. Ultimately, Fuel Network’s CEO, Nick Sway, noted Spark’s launch as a vehicle to “push” DeFi boundaries: Fuel’s mission is to foster an environment where builders can push the boundaries of DeFi, and Spark is a testament to this vision. By leveraging Fuel’s powerful high-performance design, Spark introduces a new level of transparency and efficiency to decentralized finance through on-chain order book trading, setting a new benchmark for scalability and precision.

42435174,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLQhN,1731030738,"Republicans Look Set to Win House, Clinching Electoral Sweep of Congress and White House","The Republican Party looks set to keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives, completing an electoral sweep of Congress and the presidency and the GOP leeway to pass whatever agenda they want.  As of press time, the AP had called 409 (out of 435) seats, with Democrats winning 199 seats to the Republicans' 210. The first party to reach 218 seats will win the majority, and as of Thursday evening, Republicans appeared to be within reach of that goal — confirming odds on betting site Polymarket, where traders gave Republicans at least 51% odds and growing starting at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday night. As of press time, bettors gave Republicans a 98.5% chance of winning the House.  As of 6:30 p.m. ET Thursday, Republicans led in at least 14 races, out of the 27 remaining, according to AP results, meaning if these results hold, they'll have the majority for at least another two years.  Republicans also won control of the Senate and Donald Trump won the presidential election this week. For cryptocurrencies, this increases the odds the U.S. will become a far friendlier environment.  In Alaska, Republican Nick Begich held a roughly 10,000-vote lead against Democrat Mary Peltola — who received backing from the crypto-aligned Fairshake super PAC — with 76% of votes counted.  In Arizona, David Schweikert, a longtime Congressman who co-founded the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, held a roughly 10,000-vote lead with just under 70% of the total votes counted. Republican Eli Crane also held a slim lead.  Democrat Greg Stanton held a much larger lead against his Republican opponent in the race for another of Arizona's House seats, while Juan Ciscomani — who also enjoyed Fairshake backing — trailed very narrowly with 70% of votes reported.  In Iowa, Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks held a 0.2% lead against Democrat Christina Bohannan, suggesting the race could go to a recount.  In Nebraska, Republican Don Bacon held a somewhat larger margin, leading by 3% of the votes with 95% of the total votes counted.  In Washington, Republican Dan Newhouse appears set to win against a fellow Republican, meaning this race will not benefit the Democrats at all. That brings Republicans to 217 seats.  If these results hold, Democrats would need to sweep their races in California, which has 12 races yet to be called by the AP, as well as win in the other districts they're leading, to regain the House. Republicans are leading in seven of these races at press time, though some races have just over 52% of their results counted.  Fairshake-backed Republican candidates in California include David Valadao (leading by 10% and 56% counted), Michael Garcia (leading by just over 2% and 69% counted), Young Kim (leading by 13% and 71% counted) and Michelle Steel (leading by just over 4% and 70% counted).  Republicans Ken Calvert (just under 3% lead with 76% reporting), John Duarte (just under a 3% lead with 52% reporting) and Scott Baugh (0.4% lead with 73% reporting) are also in the lead in their races.  While it is entirely possible some of these races flip by the time all votes are counted, as of press time Republicans look set to hold 224 seats, a two-seat improvement over the 118th Congress.  On Polymarket, bettors gave this outcome an 86% chance as of press time, up from around 20% when polls began to close on Tuesday night. The scenario in which Republicans hold 215 to 219 seats has the second-greatest chance, at 21%.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/08/republicans-look-set-to-clinch-electoral-sweep-echoing-polymarket-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ada78f5ec4fd71c667ef42b2dfcc0255712c872e-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This has raised questions about whether this is the highest point that the flagship crypto can reach in this market cycle, and the analyst also provided some answers. Bitcoin Price Ceiling Is At $137,000 Tony Severino mentioned in an X post that the current ceiling for the Bitcoin price is $137,000, while its floor is around $39,000. He noted that investors could double their investments from Bitcoin’s current price if the crypto reached this target. Meanwhile, a decline to the current floor represents a 50% drop. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? When asked if the $137,000 was the target for the bull top, the analyst responded that his target was between $160,000 and $180,000. He remarked that $137,000 is just the ceiling as of this month and rises as time goes by. As such, his $180,000 market top target could become more feasible in the next few months. While it remains to be seen whether the Bitcoin price could reach this $137,000 ceiling or even the $180,000 bull top target, it is almost certain that the flagship crypto might never drop to the $39,000 floor again. This is based on historical trends that show that Bitcoin never falls below its pre-election level after the US presidential elections have concluded. Therefore, the next leg of the bull run has likely begun, and the flagship crypto will likely continue to hit new highs in the coming months. In an X post, crypto analyst Jelle revealed that the Bitcoin price has resumed its uptrend after seven months of sideways action. He added that it shouldn’t be long before the falling wedge pattern on Bitcoin’s chart plays with a rise to $100,000, the potential target. The Most Bullish Background For Bitcoin At The Moment Crypto analyst CrediBULL, who had before now been bearish, said that this could arguably be the most bullish background for Bitcoin, with the elections over and Donald Trump’s victory. He added that if these are the fundamentals driving the market, then the Bitcoin price is unlikely to drop to $68,000 again. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Ignites 3,674% On Election Day, Will SHIB Move With Dogecoin Price To New ATH? He also suggested that this might be the perfect time to become bullish on the Bitcoin price as the run to $100,000 might have begun. However, he warned that any violations of the $68,700 level would “drastically” weaken the bullish argument and strengthen the bear case further. Analyst Justin Bennett also commented on the potential Bitcoin price rally to $100,000. He said that if risk assets can survive the Fed’s FOMC meeting today, this could be the move to $100,000 everyone has waited for. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $74,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
