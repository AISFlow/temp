42377406,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Zp9,1403301401,How OpenBazaar is Using Bitcoin to Build a Decentralized eBay,"What began as an award-winning concept for a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace could turn into a revolution in e-commerce.  OpenBazaar  is set to take the stage at this weekend's Bitcoin in the Beltway conference, a Washington, DC-based event that will bring together digital currency leaders and thinkers including Charlie Shrem and Vitalik Buterin. There, project maintainer Brian Hoffman will lead a discussion on the much-hyped decentralized market project.  The concept, formerly known as DarkMarket, won the Toronto Bitcoin Expo Hackathon in April for demonstrating a fully functional P2P market platform with robust decentralized infrastructure, one that enables commerce to take place without the risk of outside actors disrupting the service.  Hoffman told CoinDesk that the central value proposition for OpenBazaar is the freedom of two parties to engage in a transaction without having to rely on the security and integrity of a questionable centralized network.  Furthermore, he rejected the notion that a decentralized marketplace is inherently a hotbed for illegal activity, saying that OpenBazaar will push for lawful uses of a type of platform that was made famous by illicit black marketplace Silk Road.  Hoffman explained:  ""We’re going to try and make sure that the product has a very positive impact and goal. We’re going to try to encourage people to use it in a legal, positive way.""  OpenBazaar uses bitcoin as a medium of exchange, contributing to the decentralized nature of the platform.  Challenging traditional e-commerce  Hoffman says that OpenBazaar is about enabling the exchange of goods or services for money without the hassle of using a risky centralized exchange.  With a network unbound from interference from any authority, users can conduct business over the platform without paying any transaction fees or maintenance costs. Hoffman said that ""our approach is to take that corporate, profit-taking model out of [e-commerce]"".  As Hoffman told CoinDesk in April, when OpenBazaar first rebranded:  ""I’m trying to help sellers save money on transaction and payment processing costs, and open up new customer bases. There’s a lot more here than drug or gun sales.”  He clarified that regardless of what people are using the site to sell, OpenBazaar won’t charge fees. This, Hoffman said, can help merchants who want to expand online avoid the expenses associated with traditional online commerce tools.  eBay mentality  Hoffman acknowledged the concerns of some about the types of activity that are attracted to commercial platforms that lack any authority. He stated that the OpenBazaar team will be ""listing agnostic"" when it comes to the products or services sold over the site, leaving what is exchanged up to the community itself.  Additionally, he reiterated that the marketplace will be aimed at legitimate uses, saying that OpenBazaar won’t be pitched to those who might be tempted to use the platform to sell drugs or other illicit goods.  Hoffman explained:  ""Our approach is going to be more of like an eBay mentality, where we say that everything is good, come use us as a tool and get yourself set up and exchange whatever you choose to.""  He added that the nature of P2P transactions is to be outside of centralized control. As such, the team behind OpenBazaar doesn’t plan to take a role in censoring or limiting behavior that may take place.  Grassroots authority  Hoffman said that currently, the development team is pushing for functionalities that would enable a variety of commercial actions for users. This includes smart contracts and P2P lending.  Notably, OpenBazaar is moving to put in place a P2P arbitration process that will enable users to establish figures of authority that can help certify transactions and settle disputes between users.  Hoffman compared this to the arbitration process on centralized platforms, which often leaves those involved in the dark when decisions are made, saying:  ""Now, you’re going to be able to set up your own trusted peers, people that are on the network as arbiters, and use them so you don’t have to rely on some centralized group.""  Instilling user trust  On a more immediate level, OpenBazaar can help those who are using questionable markets to trade goods and services avoid instances of fraud or theft.  Hoffman explained:  ""Right now, there’s a lot of people using these closed dark markets that have been built with a lot of risk for the user, with escrow, [and questions of] where the site holds it. So, our benefit is that’s its completely different – the trust will be in the hands of the user.""  This also fits into the non-profit nature of OpenBazaar, which enables users to avoid using services that charge predatory fees for hosting transactions for buyers and sellers.  Overall, the platform could provide a means for online buyers and sellers to avoid the risk of costly scams and focus on what Hoffman says people should be free to do: engage in commerce without barriers.

42377409,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Zwh,1403294710,OKCoin Targets International Markets with Margin Trading Launch,"In the wake of increasingly strict policies from the People's Bank of China – China's central bank – the country's bitcoin exchanges are beginning to turn their focus to international markets and foreign buyers.  For example, on 12th June, BtcTrade announced it would introduce USD trading on its platform. OKCoin is now following suit by announcing new offerings to English-language investors with the relaunch of its previously halted peer-to-peer (P2P) margin trading services.  OKCoin now indicates that users of its Chinese-language and new English-language website can take advantage of its P2P margin trading. Site users can borrow and lend money using the service, setting the desired interest rate on loans to connect with borrowers searching for trading extensions.  Changpeng Zhao, the company's Chief Technology Officer and former Head of Development at Blockchain, emphasized that the resumed services will help the company seek a new audience for its product.  Zhao told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin has no borders. We believe users around the world will find value in our services.""  OKCoin halted its margin trading services for all customers in early May, in part so that the system could be redesigned to meet recommendations from the PBOC meant to inform customers about the risk of such financial investments.  Pain-free transactions  OKCoin's reintroduced margin trading service allows users to take up to 3x leverage at any available interest rate on the marketplace, or earn interest by lending to others.  The exchange's service, in turn, matches prospective lenders and borrowers, allowing for what it calls ""pain-free and quick loan transactions"".  The P2P service has two levels, the OK Standard Fund, featuring insured deposits and no minimum loan size, and the OK VIP Fund. Users in the latter category must sign a statement acknowledging the risk of their investment and must contribute minimum 1,000 BTC loans.  OKCoin looks abroad  In addition to its latest service and the introduction of an English-language version of its site, OKCoin has seemingly been putting an increased emphasis on foreign markets in light of recent regulatory pressure.  This larger movement by the PBOC was most recently visible in reports that China is potentially considering harsher restrictions on third-party voucher trading, a stopgap measure that helped the country's exchanges work around policies originally set by the bank in December.  Beyond a purely business focus, however, OKCoin has also been reportedly seeking to take on popular public interest projects in the digital currency space. This includes potential interest in the movement to revive insolvent Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox, a project also embraced by well-known members of the ecosystem such as VC investor and Bitcoin Foundation board member Brock Pierce.

42377405,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70Zrf,1403288173,Julian Assange: I Told Google's Eric Schmidt to Embrace Bitcoin,"Julian Assange, the embattled leader of non-profit activist media agency WikiLeaks, noted during a recent reddit Ask Me Anything discussion that while bitcoin is just coming to the attention of many of the tech industry's elite, he was personally responsible for raising awareness about the digital currency to tech giant Google, in 2011.  Had he listened, Assange claimed, Google would ""own the planet by now"".  While this may sound like a bold statement from the controversial figure, Assange in fact had an early conversation with Google executive chairman and then-CEO Eric Schmidt.  The discussion was later profiled by Schmidt while the Google chief was working on ""The New Digital World"", a book published in 2013 and co-written with Jared Cohen, a former US State Department advisor to Hillary Clinton.  The complete, unedited transcript of the interview, which can be found on Wikileaks, details Assange's early enthusiasm for bitcoin, providing a curious window into technology history. For example, Schmidt expressed curiosity about bitcoin, but ultimately seemed to pass on the then-nascent digital currency.  At the time, Assange tried to convince him otherwise, telling Schmidt:  ""You should be an early adopter. Because your bitcoins are going to be worth a lot of money one day.""  A lesson in bitcoin  Over the course of the five-hour conversation, Assange and Schmidt discussed a range of topics regarding technology, privacy and data encryption. At one point, Assange asked Schmidt if he had heard about bitcoin before. Schmidt said he had not, but Cohen indicated he had read about bitcoin the day before.  Assange saw the emergence of bitcoin as a byproduct of underground encryption enthusiasts, and during his discussion with Schmidt, he frequently pointed to the cryptographic potential in the Bitcoin protocol and its structural framework.  ""Bitcoin is something that evolved out of the cyberpunks a couple of years ago, and it is an alternative... it is a stateless currency.""  He went on to compare bitcoin's properties to gold as a store of value and a currency. Assange also suggested that bitcoin would see a major price swing in the future, although at the time he didn't directly predict that the price of bitcoin would rise to as much as $1,300 in the winter of 2013.  The WikiLeaks founder went on to detail some of the aspects of bitcoin mining, drawing a correlation between that and the mining of precious metals like gold. Discussing the nature of mining difficulty in the Bitcoin protocol, Assange framed it as a way to enforce scarcity and provide an incentive for adoption.  Assange explained:  ""To enforce scarcity, and scarcity will go up as time goes by, and what does that mean for incentives in going into the bitcoin system. That means that you should get into the bitcoin system now, early.""  Speculation on bitcoin's future  Assange also discussed the development of a decentralized alternative to the domain name system, a concept that has since served as the foundation for namecoin and other block chain projects.  He said:  ""So this bitcoin replacement for DNS is precisely what I wanted and what I was theorizing about, which is not a DNS system, but rather short names [...] short bit of text to long bit of text tuple registering service. Cause that is the abstraction of domain names and all these problems solved. Yes, you have some something that you want to register that is short, and you want to couple that to something that is unmemorable and longer.""  Assange identified some problems in the system as well, but suggested that there could be some ways in which the Bitcoin protocol could be deployed to solve them.  He said that the risk of key theft was something that would need to be addressed before broader bitcoin adoption could ever take place.  Google's bitcoin stance unclear  The episode seemed to suggest a curiosity on Google's part to investigate digital currencies further, but since then, the search engine giant has largely remained apprehensive.  Earlier this year, leaked emails suggested that Google was looking into the possible integration of bitcoin. Google later distanced itself from comments made by vice president Vic Gundotra.  Cohen himself voiced cautious support for digital currencies during a speech given at this year's SXSW festival. At the time, he said that cryptocurrencies are ""inevitable"", but that path forward remains unclear.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/20/julian-assange-i-told-googles-eric-schmidt-to-embrace-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07f77d8693db01b7a0ac9cca747c0d98be1ed50c-1600x1172.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377410,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ZuB,1403278918,Mt. Gox Victims Angered by Mark Karpeles' Twitter Return,"Mark Karpeles, the disgraced CEO of bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, is back on twitter and he is not about to win any popularity prizes for his musings.  Karpeles started tweeting a series of comments via an old account (@MagicalTux) on 15th June and, needless to say, the community response has been overwhelmingly negative.  Initial tweets that referenced Tokyo sunsets and earthquakes were met with the suggestion that Karpeles deserves to enjoy romantic sunsets from prison rather than his Japanese home.  Demands for the truth  Many of Karpeles' twitter 'followers' simply want to know the truth, with users often complaining about the bitcoins they lost in the exchange's collapse. And some lost more than others:  @MagicalTux I feel very depressed about losing 1194 BTC on your exchange Mark. I trusted you. I believed in you. Idk what happened, tell us?— warz (@warz) June 15, 2014    It has been months since Mt. Gox collapsed, falling victim to an alleged hack, but countless questions remain unanswered. Karpeles and Mt. Gox provided limited information following the closure, but many more pieces of the puzzle are still missing.  Since he reappeared on twitter, Karpeles has avoided mention of bitcoin or Mt. Gox, preferring to tweet about the weather, Japanese public transportation, instant yakisoba noodles (which he compared to instant ramen) and, of course, PHP.  So why is he back?  It all seems rather surreal and counterproductive to say the least. Karpeles is not reaching out to the community – in fact, he is antagonising it.  It’s not just reddit and twitter that are abuzz with anger, some industry leaders have been openly hostile as well.  Bitcoin evangelist and Blockchain CSO Andreas Antonopoulos went so far as to vent his anger on Wired, saying that Karpeles ""remains oblivious to his own failure and the pain he has caused others"".  Antonopoulos went even further:  “He is confirming that he is a self-absorbed narcissist with an inflated sense of self-confidence who has no remorse.”  It is impossible to say what compelled Karpeles to start tweeting again, although Antonopoulos’ diagnosis, if correct, could explain a thing or two.  People close to Karpeles, even including his mother, insist his people skills leave much to be desired, so his decision to start tweeting about Tokyo might not be as strange as it seems.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/20/mt-gox-victims-angered-by-mark-karpeles-twitter-return,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a9c2eeb978defabff5a4e71a0f3bf40817f1896c-1024x631.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ZvR,1403274183,Swiss Regulators Give Green Light for Bitcoin ATM Network,"UPDATE (28th July 10:59 BST): According to a press release, Bitcoin Suisse has now received approval from FINMA for its ATM network.  UPDATE (20th June 21:18 BST): Comments from Bitcoin Suisse about it seeking regulatory approval for its ATM have been added.      The Swiss financial regulator has given permission for bitcoin ATM operator SBEX to launch a network of machines in the country.  The news comes in the wake of a report indicating that the authority had shut down a different operator just two weeks ago.  Jumping through regulatory hoops  SBEX  , which currently operates one ATM in Geneva, can now deploy further machines because it has been accepted as a member of a non-profit organisation that is regulated by FINMA, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.  The non-profit is called ARIF, the Association Romande des Intermédiaires Financiers, and is considered a self-regulatory body (OAR) in Switzerland.  Now, with membership in hand, SBEX has successfully applied for a money transmitter licence, fulfilling the regulatory requirements to operate an ATM network.  CoinDesk has seen a copy of a letter from ARIF to the operator, dated 17th June, that sets out the regulator's stance on bitcoin ATM operators.  According to the letter, operators must join an OAR, but do not require a banking licence. It also restated that bitcoin in Switzerland is treated as a means of payment, not a good or a service.  SBEX co-founder Mathieu Buffenoir said:  ""We finally got clearance from ARIF, who were asking FINMA many questions about how they should deal with us. [The clarification from ARIF] is what we were expecting.""  Cancelled ATM launch  Two weeks ago, a competing ATM operator called Bitcoin Suisse AG cancelled the launch of an ATM in Zurich, claiming that FINMA had requested a delay while the regulator clarified ""legal questions"". This prompted speculation that Swiss authorities were clamping down on bitcoin ATMs.  However, according to Buffenoir, who has operated a machine in Geneva since February, running a single bitcoin ATM poses no special regulatory difficulties and is not regulated by FINMA.  This does come with the proviso that the business must stay within certain limits, such as completing fewer than two million transactions a year, Buffenoir said, adding:  ""I don't really know why [Bitcoin Suisse AG] made so much noise [about its ATM]. Maybe they wanted to get themselves known or they want things to move quicker.""  Bitcoin Association Switzerland president Luzius Meisser said the clarified rules were in line with the bitcoin community's expectations, calling it ""the most reasonable"" interpretation of Swiss law.  He explained the confusion over Bitcoin Suisse's suspended launch:  ""I think SBEX fulfilled all the regulatory requirements before Bitcoin Suisse did, so they got the approval first.""  Bitcoin Suisse chief executive Niklas Nikolasjen said his firm was working on obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for their ATM. He said the media had overstated his firm's cancelled ATM launch and that it had been consistently working to obtain regulatory approval.  ""It is now clear to everyone in the industry that the regulatory authorities require certain steps to be undertaken by companies who professionally deal with digital finance. BTCS is naturally following these requests as well,"" he said.  Expansion plans  Now that SBEX has cleared Swiss regulatory hurdles, Buffenoir says the company will carry out its plan to set up a web brokerage and install nine ATMs before the year is up.  Buffenoir said SBEX has already placed orders for the machines with the manufacturer, Canadian startup BitAccess.  Additionally, SBEX has joined a new consortium currently lobbying the Swiss government to create an OAR dedicated to cryptocurrencies and to obtain a clearer regulatory framework from FINMA. The consortium already counts Bitcoin Suisse and Ethereum Switzerland among its members, Buffenoir said.  Switzerland is being closely watched by the cryptocurrency community, as its executive body, the Federal Council, is due to release a comprehensive report on bitcoin's impact on the country's financial system later this year.  Swiss lawmakers also moved, in December, to obtain recognition for bitcoin as a foreign currency.

Surprisingly, though, the app was not developed by Coinbase, but is the work of Andrew Vilcsak – an AirBnB developer and bitcoin enthusiast.  However, Coinbase has given Vilcsak's app the thumbs up in a tweet:.    Great to see this community contributed app! We reached out to the dev to review the code and believe it is secure. https://t.co/hPZVSr7GOI      — Coinbase (@coinbase) June 20, 2014      No bells and whistles  Vilcsak’s open-source app is based on the Coinbase API and, the developer says, supports ""all major operations"", such as sending and receiving bitcoin, recording transaction history, balance and more.  No fancy features have been included, but many users will be happy to at last have a wallet app on their Apple device that will sync with their CoinBase account.  The app requires iOS 6.1 or later and it is compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices. It is optimised for the iPhone 5, meaning it was not optimised for phones with 4:3 aspect ratio screens.  The app has received mixed reviews and its legitimacy has been questioned by some in the community, but the tweeted endorsement from Coinbase should go a long way toward addressing these concerns.  No word on official app yet  It remains unclear whether or not Coinbase is planning on releasing an official iOS wallet.  Since Apple eased its restrictions on bitcoin-related apps earlier this month, a number of wallet apps for iOS have appeared, but big names like Coinbase and Blockchain have been conspicuously absent.  However, since small developers don’t have to jump through nearly as many hoops as big players, the delay is perhaps not surprising and official products are likely at some point in the future.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/20/coinbase-endorses-unofficial-bitcoin-wallet-app-for-apple-ios,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74b74a805693f293514052fb18823c065fc5326c-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377424,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70a9H,1403260941,Are 51% Attacks a Real Threat to Bitcoin?,"Ghash.io, one of the largest pools of individual bitcoin miners on the network, continues to cause headaches for bitcoin supporters who believe the mining process should remain decentralized and free of control from any single influencer.  To date, Ghash.io has twice come dangerously close to obtaining 51% of the bitcoin network's hashing power. The popular pool was able to gain 42% of the network in January, and, just last week, the pool reached a worrying 50%.  In theory, obtaining a majority of network power could potentially enable massive double spending and the ability to prevent transaction confirmations, among other potentially nefarious acts.  However, despite widespread concern about the vulnerability of the bitcoin network to large mining pools, there remains no easy solution to the issue.  Putting aside the ideological quandaries posed by the issue, many individual miners believe bigger pools can provide them with the best financial rewards – an important consideration given the substantial investment in power and computing equipment the process can require.  Rewards remain the primary reason pools are important. With the increasing difficulty of any one miner actually mining a block of bitcoin and vast competition, given the expanding number of individual miners, a miner attempting to go it alone risks never being able to solve a single block in today's mining market.  Still, Ghash.io has succeeded at moving the issue of this perceived vulnerability in the bitcoin network to the forefront of the conversation, and solutions are emerging from the debate that could potentially reduce the power of mining pools on the bitcoin network.  The Ghash incentive  Further to support from individual bitcoin miners, industry observers also recognize that mining pools have become a force in the ecosystem due to practical considerations inherent in the mining process.  Dave Hudson, chip architect with mining technology company PeerNova, told CoinDesk that he understands the comfort large bitcoin mining pools can provide miners in the form of steady payouts and rewards that come in equal and predictable amounts.  Hudson explained:  ""Smaller pools have more volatility. That means there may be a higher payout sometimes, but also there are chances it could be lower. Mining on a tight margin, you want the lowest volatility out there.""  Miners are looking for solid return on investment, and Ghash.io further entices by not charging any fees for participating. Thus, miners are ability to obtain monetary benefit with little risk or additional cost.  Mystery pools  Despite Ghash.io's size, little is known about the company, aside from its relationship with CEX.IO – a trading exchange that uses the Ghash.io pool for cloud mining as well as gigahash trading.  So far, Ghash.io has argued against quick fixes to the problem, instead focusing the conversation on the larger issue that mining pools, by their very nature, are growing.  Now, given its involvement and the negative perception around Ghash.io, CEX.IO has entered the conversation, publicly voicing its stance on the issue of the 51% issue.  Should Ghash.io, become smaller, CEX.IO reasons, miners may simply form another equally large pool, thereby simply creating the same problem elsewhere.  CEX.IO Chief Information Officer Jeffery Smith said in a recent blog post that while the decision by large industrial miner BitFury to move to another pool in light of the issue is helpful, it's only a stopgap solution for the time being:  ""[It] does not address the core issue, only pushing the problem a few weeks or months down the road when another pool or perhaps Ghash.io again grows towards 51%.""  It's also unknown how problematic this shift could be given that the size of many mining pools is unknown.  For instance, the 'unknown' pool normally seen in network charts that currently has 26% of total hashing power.  Some observers think that 'unknown' is a collection of private pools, while others see it as one single entity – it’s a murky subject that has caused much discussion as to who or what it represents.  Mining pool operators, while trying their best to stay out of the limelight, do still have to utilize the block chain, however, meaning work could be done to shed more light on this part of the industry. Further, major names in the bitcoin space are advocating for such community action.    Help us improve @blockchain’s mining pool identification by submitting known tags or mining addresses via PR here: https://t.co/IasBYaUF4G      — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) June 19, 2014    Hudson, the PeerNova chip designer, says that while Ghash.io and the ‘unknown’ pool are concerns, they could theoretically be tracked down with some effort:  “Pool operators may be secretive for the most part, but the block chain will always be there.”  Influence of industrial mines  Together with the rise of large mining pools, bitcoin has also seen the consolidation of mining equipment into large industrial mines, some of which – like MegaBigPower in the US – have been estimated to churn out $8m a month in bitcoin at peak prices.  ASIC mining designer BitFury is one such industrial mine that is able to exert control over mining market. It also notably provides equipment to other industrial mines, including MegaBigPower.  Niko Punin, Head of Product Development for BitFury, told CoinDesk that the company's chips power around 40% of miners today. It's notable that BitFury has become vocal and proactive about the issue of possible 51% attacks, given its ability to potential to take the lead on any potential solution.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Punin reiterated his company’s stance that Ghash.io, while lucrative for miners because of less margins as a result of no fees, still needs to have a smaller share of network power:  “We're working on it to lower [Ghash.io’s share] by moving to our own pool.”  In fact, removing its 1PH/s of power from the pool has helped to bring Ghash.io’s share of the network down to just over 30%.  Furthermore, BitFury itself is also in the process of making its influence better known to the larger bitcoin community, following the $20m it recently raised in funding.  The investment will help BitFury to build out its operations and, many hope, continue to be an influential check to the balance of power among the larger pools like Ghash.io.  The 51% debate  For now, though, there remains a heated debate around whether there should be cause for concern, should one mining pool grow to comprise more than 50% of the bitcoin network.  Hudson has been studying the current state of bitcoin mining as part of his work at PeerNova, the mining conglomerate that formed as a result of a merger between hosted miner service CloudHashing and hardware designer HighBitcoin.  Hudson believes, along with thought leaders in the industry such as Andreas Antonopoulos, that possessing 51% of network power is not enough to enable an all-out attack.  Hudson said:  “There’s this whole question: What can you actually really do if you hold that much of the network capacity?”  In theory, one might be able to affect the next block or two, launching a double-spending attack by holding on to enough power to confirm the majority of transactions. However, this would take a huge amount of expense and effort and, should a big double spend be attempted, the data would likely appear on the block chain for all to see.  Worse, such an attack could possibly destroy the integrity of the system as a whole, causing the price to crash. This is not something anyone with a vested interest in bitcoin would want – especially miners, whose profits depend largely on the price of bitcoin being high. Hence, there is no real incentive to attack the network.  Furthermore, as Antonopoulos points out, should a pool try to mount such an attack, bitcoin's core code could be changed to destroy that company's business. It just wouldn't be worth the risk on several levels.  Distributed pools  However, the larger philosophical debates are now yielding to real action on a grassroots level.  Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen recently advocated on the non-profit's official blog for miners to use more decentralized practices in order to prevent any sort of pool majority from theoretically taking over the network.  In a post titled ‘Centralized Mining’, Andresen wrotehttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/06/13/centralized-mining/:  “If you are mining with Ghash.io I would strongly urge you to try one of the smaller pools, or, even better, take the time to run bitcoind and p2pool.”  P2Pool  is decentralized mining pool software, that, working in combination with the bitcoin client and mining hardware, will complete proof-of-work through bitcoin nodes.  This is similar to the way bitcoin itself is designed to confirm transactions through nodes on its network.  The P2Pool software is free and while it requires a bit more work to configure than just using a pool, it is a better network protection method over mining with Ghash.io.  P2Pool is also competitive from a cost perspective, as it only has a 1% optional fee for development purposes, while potentially appealing to bitcoin purists who favor decentralization.  Emerging alternatives  P2Pool, or any decentralized pool solution for bitcoin mining, though, is only as good as the number of people who are using it. This means that until miners flock to them, they will have the same amount of volatility as small pools currently do.  It’s up to the miners to decide: More centralization with large pools, or less with smaller or distributed ones?  In the end, options are open. If the mining community wants to keep the network distributed, that's a choice made for the future of bitcoin's decentralization, the foundation many argue it was originally built upon.  Travis Skweres, co-founder of the CoinMKT crytpocurrency exchange, agrees that the Ghash.io issue is a long-term problem that needs a solution:  “Though I doubt GHash has bad intentions, philosophically it's bad to see 51% reached so easily as, in the future, a group with strong mining hardware could put bitcoin at risk.”  It’s no wonder, then, that Skweres' exchange is trying to manage bitcoin's vulnerabilities. With CoinMKT also offering a wide choice of altcoin trading pairs, the startup is hedging risk against bitcoin's potential problems down the line as a result of centralized mining.  Skweres added:  “This again affirms why I'm coin agnostic, as I like seeing coins that try to democratize mining.”  Distributed bitcoin image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/20/are-51-attacks-a-real-threat-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5826df2a1941561ba54c815c61e0675682afd623-1299x781.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
