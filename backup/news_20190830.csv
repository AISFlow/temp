42430915,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMycrh,1567202444,Billionaire Investor Eyes $1 Billion Crypto Hedge Fund,"The billionaire head of Brevan Howard hedge fund, Alan Howard, is launching a crypto portfolio platform that aims to make stable investments in a notoriously volatile market.  The platform is geared towards institutional clients and will make strategic investments in other crypto hedge funds, becoming a kind of fund of funds, according to a Financial Times report on August 30.  The fund is projected to manage as much as $1 billion in investments. This venture comes amid a tempered bull run lead by bitcoin’s surge in price. According to data firm Hedge Fund Research, crypto-focused investment pools are up nearly 60 percent over the first two quarters this year.  Elwood Asset Management, the firm that manages Howard’s personal digital assets, will oversee the launch, construction and direction of the new fund. The aim is to find firms that satisfy Elwood’s due diligence in order to avoid so-called blow ups.  “Losing traditional assets in the real world is hard. In the digital world, it’s very easy to lose assets — put in the wrong address for a bitcoin transfer and it’s gone forever,” said Bin Ren, CEO, blockchain funds specialist at Elwood.  Ideally, Howard’s venture will identify enough firms to invest in to offer their own clients portfolio options that satisfy their risk profiles, liquidity needs and diversity requirements.  Details are forthcoming, but Elwood may design bespoke portfolios for each investor. For the service, Elwood will charge an undisclosed management fee, in addition to a fee to access the underlying funds.  Previously, Elwood and investment management company Invesco co-launched an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with stakes in companies developing blockchain technology.  In an interview with Bloomberg in March, Ren said: “The only way for institutions to get meaningful exposure to digital assets has been to buy Bitcoin, but many are reluctant or unable to buy Bitcoin -- and for good reason.”  Howard has invested in cryptocurrencies since 2017, including an early investment in Block.one, the corporate parent of EOS. He is not involved in the day to day operations at Elwood.

The messaging company is expected to release the code to run a node on the Telegram Open Network (TON) on Sunday, allowing users to trial its project in advance of the project’s expected mainnet launch on Oct. 31.  TON Labs, a tech startup helmed by investors in Telegram’s token sale, is building a number of tools for developers to help them build on the new network. One of these tools will be a Solidity compiler, which will allow decentralized applications built for ethereum to also run on TON, said TON Labs CEO and managing partner Alexander Filatov.  Filatov told CoinDesk:  ""That was probably the most difficult thing we built. It will allow the advanced Ethereum community to pull everything they wrote for ethereum into TON.""  The compiler has been in testing since July, he said.  Pre-launch tests  As mentioned, TON is expected to launch by Oct. 31. If it does not, Telegram will have to refund investors in its token sale, according to its user agreement. Sunday’s release, therefore, is expected to be the last in a series of testnet releases.  Filatov said Sunday’s code release will be the most important stage of TON’s rollout, saying:  ""We have very little time between the node release and the mainnet launch to test, identify and fix possibly bugs and vulnerabilities.""  Code for a light client was shared with investors earlier this year and immediately leaked to the general publichttps://test.ton.org/download.html. Filatov said this client allowed users to play around with some of the TON blockchain’s basic functions.  ""You can play with GRAMs [the network’s token], write a simple smart contract talking to the node via a light client [and] create a wallet,"" Filatov said.

Gangnam, Seoul-based Artbloc this month acquiredFocus Moving, 2018 and Pictured Gathering with Mirror, 2018. It will be issuing 8,500 tokens for the former and 5,000 for the latter and offering the tokens during an event to be held at Lounge K in Gangnam on September 19.  Each token will be priced at 9,900 won ($8.18).  The tokens will be recorded utilizing ethereum and will be tradeable privately or via a platform for exchange to be set up in Hong Kong early next year. They will not be listed on crypto exchanges as each work will have its own token.  Jun Kim, CEO of Artbloc, says that the idea is to bring high-end works to regular investors and customers. With galleries and auction houses serving the rich and with the middle class only able to buy cheaper works, he saw an opening.  ""Artbloc will sell high-end art to the public,"" Kim said.  He keyed in on Hockney because the artist is extremely popular in South Korea. An exhibition was held from March through August this year at the Seoul Museum of Art. It was a popular show and well covered in the local press, so much so that Hockney is now almost a household name. His Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold for $90 million in 2018, the most ever for a painting by a living artist and 5,000 times the original price.  ""It was so hot,"" says Kim of the exhibition in Seoul. ""We can sell factional ownership to normal people.""  Kim would not disclose the price he paid for the first two paintings he acquired, but he did say that he was in the market for more works. He is especially interested in paintings by Roy Lichtenstein.  ""This is just the pilot,"" he says. ""It's just the first step.""  Kim has incorporated an entity in Hong Kong—Artbloc Marketplace—but he says that the works themselves will be kept and displayed by galleries in Seoul so that the public and the fractional owners can view them.

Reveals Q1 Financial Loss,"The Electric Coin Company (ECC), the for-profit company that supports the development of the zcash cryptocurrency has issued its Q3 transparency report, revealing it has so far avoided layoffs during the bear market despite financial losses.  According to the report, the company ran an average monthly deficit of 30 percent in Q1. The ECC took in $449,000 per month while expenses averaged $635,000.  In a July letter, EEC CEO and Zcash co-founder Zooko Wilcox said the company had successfully navigated the bear market, which saw multiple teams cut staff or close up shop entirely. According to the company’s profile on Linkedin, the ECC currently has 19 employees.  Launched in 2016 without an initial coin offering, new cryptocurrency created by the protocol has since been divided between miners, the Zcash Foundation, the ECC and certain founders as well as employees.  As of today's mining schedule, 80 percent of the block reward goes toward miners with the remainder dispersed as a ""Founder's Reward.""  At an average of $55 per coin, the ECC made $336,900 per month on block rewards alone in Q1. Expenses hit $525,000 for the company plus another $110,000 per month for employees over the same period.  Due to the deficit, the report states the ECC cut costs in numerous non-critical areas like PR, trademark protection and engineering. The ECC also approached Founder's Reward recipients to reallocate funds for the ECC in June.  As mentioned, the report comes a month after Wilcox’s open letter to the Zcash community. The development fund is set to run dry in October 2020, which would slash funding for the ECC. In the letter, Wilcox called for a new development fund for the company.

42403236,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfIaH,1567165237,Top 10 Cryptocurrencies Now Trading Below 200-Day Price Averages,"Bitcoin now stands alone in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value at CoinMarketCap, with the rest having fallen below a key long-term moving average.  The top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value, ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), binance coin (BNB), EOS, bitcoin SV (BSV) and stellar (XLM), have now all closed firmly beneath their 200-period moving average (MA) on the daily chart.  The event marks a period of greater selling momentum, confirming the majority of the bearish mood currently prevailing among investors. Most traders now have their funds locked up in bitcoin (BTC), as seen by its high dominance rating standing at 69.1 percent.  The majority of the top 10 altcoins had already been trending bearish below the 200-period MA for some time (as early as July) while bitcoin cash (BCH) completed the set passing beneath the average on August 28.  As it stands all major top 10 alternative currencies by total market capitalization are now below the key moving average with traders bracing the possibility for another violent sell-off.  The onus is now heavily on the bulls to recoup losses above the 200-period MA’s or risk reverting back to 2018’s market trend of significant long-term lower lows and lower highs.  Death cross  Deepening the possibility of a greater drawdown from its recent peak high at $146 on June 22, litecoin’s (LTC) death cross looms on the daily chart with the 50-period MA and the 200-period MA flirting for a cross.  When the short-term 50-period MA passes below the long-term 200-period MA it signals a death cross, a reliable predictor of some of the worst bear markets in traditional stocks and crypto alike.  The possibility is notable given that litecoin lead the crypto market recovery earlier this year, when traders bought up the crypto asset in anticipation of its reward halving. Still, despite the event that reduced the mining reward from 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC, the world’s fifth largest crypto by market value appears to be rallying the markets for another drop.

42403234,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfIZI,1567163169,Bitcoin Price Faces Third Monthly Loss of 2019,"View  Bitcoin is on track to test $9,000, having dived out of a narrowing price range earlier this week. The cryptocurrency is likely to end August on a negative note, having suffered losses in July and January.  BTC may suffer a deeper price drop over the next few months, possibly to the 200-day moving average near $7,400, if prices print a UTC close below $9,049 on Saturday, confirming a bearish reversal on the monthly chart.  A minor price bounce, possibly to the Aug. 22 low of $9,755, could be seen before a drop to $9,000, as an hourly chart indicator is reporting bullish conditions.  The short-term bearish case would be invalidated if prices find acceptance above $10,280 (Wednesday's high), although that looks unlikely. A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 for bullish revival, as discussed earlier this month.      Bitcoin (BTC) looks set to register its third monthly loss of the year with a moderate price drop in August.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $9,600, representing a 4.8 percent drop on the opening price of $10,096 observed on Aug. 1, according to Bitstamp data.  If prices remain below $10,096 till Saturday's UTC close, then it would be the third monthly loss of 2019. BTC fell 7.59 percent and 6.27 percent in January and July, respectively, as seen in the chart below.  Bitcoin's five-month winning run – the biggest since August 2017 – ended last month.  January's 7.59 percent decline was the sixth consecutive monthly drop – the longest losing streak on record.  It is worth noting that the monthly close (Saturday, UTC) is still 37 hours away and the cryptocurrency is currently down just $586 from the monthly opening price of $10,096.  In the past, BTC has moved violently by $1,000 or more in a matter of just a few minutes. For instance, prices rose from $9,300 to $10,400 in 30 minutes during the U.S. trading hours on July 18.  So, the possibility of BTC finding acceptance above $10,096 before Saturday's UTC close cannot be ruled out. That would amount to a monthly gain.  Technical charts, however, indicate the sellers are in control and prices are more likely to end the month with losses.  3-day chart and hourly charts  The contracting triangle breakdown seen in the three-day chart (above left) indicates a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  The three-day chart relative strength index (RSI) has also dropped below 50 for the first time since mid-March. A below-50 print indicates bearish market conditions.  The Chaikin money flow, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes, has found acceptance below the zero line, a sign of increasing selling pressure.  All-in-all, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside and the cryptocurrency may drop to the psychological support of $9,000 in the next 24 hours or so. A violation there would expose the ascending 50-candle moving average (MA) support, currently lined up at $8,738.  A slide to $9,000, however, could be preceded by a minor price bounce to the former support-turned-resistance of $9,755 (Aug. 22 low), as the RSI on the hourly chart (above right) has moved into the bullish territory above 50.00.  While the hourly RSI has turned bullish, the stacking order of the 50-hour MA, below the 100-hour MA, below the 200-hour MA is a classic bearish signal. So, these averages, currently located at $9,648, $9,932 and $10,048, will likely offer strong resistance.  Monthly chart  BTC created an “inside bar” pattern in July, with the monthly high and low of $13,200 and $9,049, respectively, falling within June’s trading range of $13,880 to $7,432.  Essentially, the inside bar setup represents a narrowing price range characterized by higher lows and lower highs – a sign of an indecisive market or consolidation.  A convincing break below the inside bar's low (range breakdown) is widely considered a sign of bearish reversal.  So, July’s low of $9,049 is the level to beat for sellers. A monthly close below that level would imply a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and shift risk in favor of a drop to the 200-day moving average (MA), currently at $7,468.

42403226,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfIOT,1567148427,Capital One Hacker Used Stolen Computing Power to Mine Crypto,"A federal grand jury indictment of a former Amazon software engineer accused of breaching Capital One’s data servers reveals instances of crypto-jacking at the heart of her scheme.  Between March and July 2019, Paige Thompson accessed at least 30 institutions’ servers managed by an unnamed cloud computing company, compromising at least 100 million customer accounts, according to a release published Wednesday. While there is no indication Thompson attempted to sell this information, she did use stolen computing power to mine cryptocurrencies.  According to the indictment, Thompson scanned for and misconfigured vulnerable web firewalls to gain access to rented cloud servers. She would duplicate sensitive “buckets of data” onto her own server kept at home, and cover her tracks using the anonymizing TOR browser.  “The object also was to use the access to the customers’ servers in other ways for [her] own benefit, including by using those servers for cryptojacking,” wrote prosecuting attorneys Steven Masada and Andrew Friedman.  Thompson reportedly spoke about her fraud over Slack and Twitter DMs. At one point, Thompson, under an alleged pseudonym, posted messages referring to cryptojacking over a Slack channel.  “I’ll be employed again soon and if I had a partner I could have them take over my cryptojacking enterprise and be a stay at home,"" one such message read, according to a report by Forbes staffer Thomas Brewster.  Another Slack message read: “For some reason i lost a whole fleet of miners all at the same time, so i think someone is onto me.”  Law enforcement became aware of Thompson’s activity after she shared information on GitHub relating to her theft of information from Capital One’s rented servers. The indictment also cites three unnamed victims including a state agency, a telecommunications conglomerate outside the U.S. and a public research university.  She faces up to 25 years in prison if found guilty of the charges, which include two counts of wire fraud and computer fraud. Additionally, Thompson is asked to forfeit her ill-gotten gains, or equivalent assets if inaccessible or untraceable.

Walsh said the trade now runs on cryptocurrency, later adding that ""child abusers are successful when they can create secrecy,"" adding:  ""When you add a layer that is encrypted that is anonymous or pseudo-anonymous, then it makes it very difficult for investigators to counter that challenge and also, it really makes it easier for the bad guys to do what they do, and that creates risks, especially for our children.""  Further, Walsh said efforts should target crypto exchanges where illicit funds may be washed. Added security protocols would not interfere with the average user, he suggested, as “there isn’t really a large amount of risk around declaring who you are and that you have an interest in moving value.”  Walsh highlighted efforts put forward by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as one possible way of tracking who might be moving value using cryptocurrencies.  In June, FATF, the intergovernmental organization devoted to combating money laundering and terrorism financing, finalized its recommendations on regulating cryptocurrencies for its 37 member countries, including a rule that “virtual asset service providers” (VASPs), meaning crypto exchanges, enact the so-called ""travel rule.""  Under this stipulation, exchanges and wallet providers would be required to have know-your-customer information not only for their own users, but also for the users of wallets or exchange accounts that funds are being sent to.  ""We're still waiting to see how that plays out,"" Walsh said, but he added that the U.N. has brought together policymakers and experts to work on finding the best policy to regulate the space.  ""We've brought together those policymakers, lawyers, those cryptocurrency experts to try and look what policy might look like in this space, because when we look at some of the really high-risk crime where we see kids, I'm talking babies very, very young, six months old and younger, who are in pay per view live online child sexual abuse streaming websites,"" Walsh said, adding:  ""That's getting paid for by cryptocurrencies. We need to have some sort of options. We need to know how we try and challenge that threat and reduce the risks for kids and reduce the opportunities for criminals to get involved. And it's gonna take lots of different brains. It's going to take technologists, policymakers, philosophers, the whole nine yards.""

42403227,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfIQR,1567126854,Why Tether Volume Is at All-Time Highs,"A year after China banned local fiat on-ramps for crypto exchanges, Chinese traders continue to drive the market forward by using the dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT).  “Crypto trading businesses are restricted from accessing banking services in China, but they are thriving nonetheless,” Dragonfly Capital Partners co-founder Alexander Pack told CoinDesk.  Traders generally work around such banking restrictions by using stablecoins. According to CoinMarketCap, USDT activity reached an all-time high this month with a global market cap exceeding $4 billion. Tether is reportedly used in between 40-80 percent of all transactions on the exchanges Huobi and Binance, the latter of which now offers loans based on USDT collateral.  But since this asset is favored among over-the-counter (OTC) traders, official exchange volumes hardly paint a complete picture.  Blockchain data from CoinMetrics tallying a full year of transactions detected an annual peak in activity on Aug. 7, with 78,100 active wallets for USDT and nearly 21,300 for the ethereum-based counterpart USDTe. In fact, according to data site ETH Gas Station, Tether paid nearly $261,000 in fees to ethereum mines just to run this secondary version of the stablecoin. (Another Tether-issued stablecoin is on the way, this time pegged to the Chinese yuan.)  All things considered, USDT brokers have carved out a lucrative niche in 2019, especially brokers that provide fiat liquidity.  “Tether has truly good liquidity in China,” a Chinese investor speaking on the condition of anonymity told CoinDesk. “One of the primary use-cases is a fiat on- and off-ramp for crypto trading. I did also see some people using tether for legit business use-cases like cross-border trading.”  On the other hand, two different Asian OTC traders, who requested anonymity to protect their businesses, told CoinDesk a significant portion of their traction comes from Chinese clients using USDT to move assets beyond their homeland’s strict capital controls.  “This has always been a significant part of OTC flows in crypto,” one Hong Kong-based trader said. For example, his desk conducted $45 million worth of trades on Aug. 6, with UDST representing more than half the volume.  Chinese bulls  Experts believe this surge in USDT usage may be driven by enthusiasm for a potential bull market return, rather than any changes in capital flight patterns.  “Tether is the easiest way to hold a relatively stable volume of value at an exchange that doesn't accept dollars,” the U.S.-based trader said. “It’s much more about that [USDT] network effect than any technology, infrastructure or other advantage.”  In short, OTC traders provide fiat on-ramps to USDT, although this is a gray market within Chinese borders. Then Chinese traders use USDT to liquidate their broader portfolios on global exchanges like Binance, Huobi or OkCoin. This affects the bitcoin market because traders and exchanges generally use the godfather cryptocurrency for fiat liquidity beyond OTC. Exchanges like Kraken and Bitfinex offer such bitcoin trading pairs.  However, the anonymous trader in Hong Kong noted this isn’t the only way Chinese traders are influencing the broader market, adding:  “There are billions of dollars coming out of China that have nothing to do with capital controls.”  For example, the Antigua-based FTX crypto futures market that launched in April now facilitates between $50 million to $300 million in daily volume, according to CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. He told CoinDesk the bulk of those 10,000 FTX users hail from China and are served out of an office in Hong Kong. (Consequently, USDT futures contracts are among the top performers.)  The asset’s relative stability in 2019, oscillating only a few cents in August despite spikes in demand, may seem remarkable given the legal counsel for its namesake issuance company admitted this stablecoin is not backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars. Plus, the issuer’s sister company, Bitfinex, faces legal scrutiny in New York over allegedly misusing USDT to cover company losses.  Yet the anonymous Chinese investor said many traders saw the Bitfinex initial exchange offering this summer as a “bank bailout” to the tune of $1 billion, one which insured the continued reliability of USDT.  “Many users understand that Bitfinex is behind Tether and that’s incredibly important in the industry,” she said. “[Bitfinex] is one of the most non-compliant exchanges out there, but the nature of that tends to attract a lot of support from hardcore bitcoiners.”  Tether image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,USDT,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/08/30/why-tether-volume-is-at-all-time-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0f40f554c582266d435421d88766c2d58afec41-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
