42394587,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDSkD,1466866841,Understanding The DAO Attack,"The basics  The Ethereum network is a network of computers all running the Ethereum blockchain. The blockchain allows people to exchange tokens of value, called ether, which is currently the second most popular cryptocurrency behind bitcoin. ethereum also allows people to write and put on the network smart contracts – general-purpose code that executes on every computer in the network (currently over 6,000 computers). People then execute these programs by sending ether to them.  A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Its goal is to codify the rules and decision-making apparatus of an organization, eliminating the need for documents and people in governing, creating a structure with decentralized control.  Here’s how a DAO works:  A group of people writes the smart contracts (programs) that will run the organization  There is an initial funding period, in which people add funds to the DAO by purchasing tokens that represent ownership – this is called a crowdsale, or an initial coin offering (ICO) – to give it the resources it needs.  When the funding period is over, the DAO begins to operate.  People then can make proposals to the DAO on how to spend the money, and the members who have bought in can vote to approve these proposals.  It’s important to understand that great care has been taken not to make these tokens into equity shares – they are more like contributions that give people voting rights but not ownership. In most cases, a DAO is not owned by anyone – it’s just software running on the ethereum network.  The very first DAO is bitcoin itself, which is governed by consensus among its core team and its mining network. All other DAOs have been launched on the ethereum platform.  “The DAO” is the name of a particular DAO, conceived of and programmed by the team behind German startup Slock.it – a company building “smart locks” that let people share their things (cars, boats, apartments) in a decentralized version of Airbnb.  The DAO launched on 30th April, 2016, with a 28-day funding window.  For whatever reason, The DAO was popular, raising over $100m by 15th May, and by the end of the funding period, The DAO was the largest crowdfunding in history, having raised over $150m from more than 11,000 enthusiastic members. The DAO raised far more money than its creators expected.  It can be said that the marketing was better than the execution, for during the crowdsale, several people expressed concerns that the code was vulnerable to attack.  Once the crowdsale was over, there was much discussion of first addressing the vulnerabilities before starting to fund proposals. In particular, Stephan Tual, one of The DAO’s creators, announced on 12th June that a ""recursive call bug"" had been found in the software but that ""no DAO funds [were] at risk"".  At the time, more than 50 project proposals were waiting for The DAO’s token holders to vote on them.  It’s important to reiterate that the ethereum network has no such bugs and has been working perfectly the entire time. All networked systems are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. The ethereum network, which supports (depending on the price) around $1bn worth of ether, has not been hacked and is continuously executing many other smart contracts.  Everyone who writes a smart contract knows that if it can move a large amount of cash it will be subject to attack. This particular vulnerability was discovered recently in another system, called Maker DAO, and was neutralized quickly because that DAO was still in testing.  Many people feel that testing and certifying smart contracts will be an important part of keeping the ethereum ecosystem safe. You’ll find several smart-contract validation services listed at DecentralStation.com.  The DAO Hack  Unfortunately, while programmers were working on fixing this and other problems, an unknown attacker began using this approach to start draining The DAO of ether collected from the sale of its tokens.  By Saturday, 18th June, the attacker managed to drain more than 3.6m ether into a “child DAO” that has the same structure as The DAO. The price of ether dropped from over $20 to under $13.  Several people made attempts to split The DAO to prevent more ether from being taken, but they couldn’t get the votes necessary in such a short time. Because the designers didn’t expect this much money, all the ether was in a single address (bad idea), and we believe the attacker stopped voluntarily after hearing about the fork proposal (see below). In fact, that attack, or another similar one, could continue at any time.  Smart contracts are meant to be stand-alone agreements – not subject to interpretation by outside entities or jurisdictions. The code itself is meant to be the ultimate arbiter of ""the deal"" it represents. But of course, that’s an idealist (crypto-anarchist) perspective.  Even before the attack, several lawyers raised concerns that The DAO overstepped its crowdfunding mandate and ran afoul of securities laws in several countries. Lawyers also pointed to its creators as potentially liable for any problems that may occur, and several expressed concern that token holders of The DAO were accepting responsibility they were likely unaware of. The DAO exists in a gray area of law and regulation.  Because the child DAO has the same structure, limitations, and vulnerabilities as the parent DAO, the ether in this newly created child DAO can’t be accessed for 28 days, as that is the initial funding period.  Everyone can see the ether in this child DAO – any attempts to cash it in will trigger alarms and investigations. It could be that the attacker will never get to cash or spend a single ether of it.  It’s entirely possible that the attacker had a large short position on ether at the time of the attack, which he or she then cashed out after ether had been cut roughly in half. The attacker may already have made his money, regardless of the ether sitting in the child DAO.  There are things the Ethereum Foundation could do that may be able to nullify the ether in this DAO. That’s where things get complicated.  The Soft-Fork Proposal  The DAO contains roughly 15% of all ether, so a failure of The DAO has a negative impact on the ethereum network and its cryptocurrency.  It’s worth noting that dozens of startups are working on DAO or governance products, many smart contracts have similar vulnerabilities and building complex software using smart contracts is still in its infancy. Everyone involved has a stake in what happens next.  All eyes are on The DAO and the Ethereum Foundation, hoping for a resolution that allows the ecosystem to continue to develop as it was before.  To understand what happens next, you will need to understand blockchain basics: A network of nodes puts transactions into blocks and blocks into a single chain that represents the ""truth"" of what has happened. If two competing transactions happen at about the same time, the network resolves this conflict by choosing one and rejecting the other, so all nodes have the exact same copy of the distributed ledger.  The only way to ""rewrite history"" would be to have at least 51% of all nodes agree to such a collusion – something that has never happened in the history of bitcoin or ethereum. The goal of a decentralized network is that no one has the power to do that, or the network itself becomes untrustworthy.  On 17th June, Vitalik Buterin of the Ethereum Foundation issued a critical update, saying that the DAO was under attack and that he had worked out a solution:  A software fork has been proposed, (with NO ROLLBACK; no transactions or blocks will be “reversed”) which will make any transactions that make any calls/callcodes/delegatecalls that reduce the balance of an account with code hash0x7278d050619a624f84f51987149ddb439cdaadfba5966f7cfaea7ad44340a4ba (ie. the DAO and children) lead to the transaction (not just the call, the transaction) being invalid …  In this, Buterin specifically states that he isn’t proposing to rewrite any blocks, but just to install a “switch” in the basic ethereum code that prevents moving any ether out of the DAO or its children.  Effectively, this is a one-time fix (called a “fork”) for a one-time event that seals those ether into that address for all time.  Buterin continued:  ""Miners and mining pools should resume allowing transactions as normal, wait for the soft fork code and stand ready to download and run it if they agree with this path forward for the Ethereum ecosystem. DAO token holders and ethereum users should sit tight and remain calm. Exchanges should feel safe in resuming trading ETH.""  In other words, a blacklist will be built into the ethereum code to keep the bad guy from claiming his prize. In this “freezing of assets” scenario, Buterin calls for a discussion of how to help DAO token holders recover their initial investment.  This seemingly innocuous and well-meaning “Deus ex machina” proposal – which must still be adopted by a majority of ethereum network nodes to take effect – has opened a huge can of worms.  The Attacker Responds — or Does He?  I will call the attacker a lone male, even though I have no idea if he is one.  What happened next was interesting. In an open letter to The DAO and ethereum Community, the attacker supposedly claimed that his “reward” was legal and threatened to take legal action against anyone who tried to invalidate his work. Several people pointed out that the cryptographic signature in this message wasn’t valid – it could be fake.  But it’s well written, and from a certain point of view, well reasoned: The premise of smart contracts is that they are their own arbiters and that nothing outside the code can “change the rules” of the transaction.  Later, through an intermediary, the attacker claimed that he would put a stop to the organized “theft” of his property by rewarding miners (nodes) who don’t go along with the proposed soft fork, saying:  ""[S]oon we will have a smart contract to reward miners who oppose the soft fork and mines the transaction. 1m ETH + 100 BTC will be shared with miners.""  This is clearly a complex dynamic system.  These messages from ""the attacker”""cannot be verified, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens.  The Hard-Fork Proposal  Another proposal is more aggressive – to ask the miners to completely unwind the theft and return all ether to The DAO, where it can be redeemed by token holders automatically, thereby ending The DAO.  As Stephan Tual puts it in his blog …  A subsequent hard fork could even return all ether, including the DAO’s ‘extraBalance’ and the stolen funds, back into a smart contract. That smart contract would contain a single function: withdraw().  This would make it possible for everyone who participated in the DAO to withdraw their funds: thanks to the support of the miners, and because nothing had been spent so far, nothing would be lost.""  This has the effect of rewriting the rules by which the blockchain executes, which is supposed to be impossible. Should we let that rule slide just this one time, to put the ethereum project back on track?  The Slock.it guys and most DAO tokenholders would be grateful if we did.  Responses to the soft fork  Seen on its own, the proposal is reasonable. It's a one-time fix to a one-time problem. But many people don’t see it that way.  You can read the massive response on Reddit, which I will try to summarize:  Trustworthiness of the network is sacred.  As one person on Reddit put it:  ""The involvement of the ethereum foundation in the DAO has been and is a mistake. As I see it ethereum is supposed to be the foundational infrastructure upon which a flurry of projects and experiments are supposed to blossom, and in order for them to blossom they need a foundation that is strong, and that has integrity in the face of challenges. The hard fork proposal is a compromise that ruins that integrity and signals that projects like the DAO can influence the underlying foundation to their own advantage. To me that is totally unacceptable and is a departure from the principles that drew me to ethereum.""  The hard fork is a valid option, but it should be kept for situations which require emergency modifications of the ethereum protocol itself, and not for projects that run on it.  The fact that the Ethereum Foundation has been involved in and promoted The DAO project has been an error and it only usurps the trust that people have in ethereum as a foundational infrastructure for other projects.  I hope they will correct this error.  Another one chimed in:  ""I made a bad contract in the first days ETH was online and lost 2K ETH with it, can I also get it back? Thanks!""  And finally:  ""Ethereum worked exactly as intended. I don’t believe software should be updated when it works exactly as intended. You assume the risks of your investment. If you don’t understand your investment, you assume unknown risk. Anything else is a bailout by a central authority, i.e. the antithesis of the crypto world. In a related way, this is why Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail – because the deal is the deal, and if you bend the rules for a particular player, all other players will want special treatment, too.""  Too Big to Fail  Just a month after Lehman Brothers, other banks did get special treatment, and you can decide for yourself whether that was a good idea – it’s quite analogous to the situation at hand. The DAO is not an island.  It is considered ""too big to fail"" from the point of view of the ethereum ecosystem. It may be noted that several people from the Ethereum Foundation are DAO token holders and also have advisory positions in The DAO. Even Gavin Wood, one of the original ethereum founders, supported the fork in a blog post.  In this view, then, it’s possible that some other large projects could need to be rescued and the Ethereum Foundation, having set a precedent once, may once again ask miners to rewrite history.  The analogy to the bank bailouts is remarkable: banks were able to take huge risks hoping for huge returns, and when those trades went south, the taxpayers bailed them out (except for poor Lehman Brothers). This risk asymmetry is generally thought of as a bad way to incentivize market participants.  Those are the two extremes, but most people fall into one or the other. The long arm of the law, not to mention the tax man  The above discussion assumes we are operating in a vacuum, in crypto-anarchy space, where laws don’t apply. But people have invested real money and real laws can and will apply to this case.  In fact, all parties here may have legitimate claims that could take years to settle out in courts around the world.  Who's at risk?  Even though they took great care to not create securities and make sure people were aware of the risks, they still may be held liable. If the DAO token holders lose most of their $150m+ investment, a class-action suit against the originators seems likely.  Other DAOs     Some people have taken The DAO smart contract word for word to implement other DAOs. In the case of a hard fork, all of the ether in any DAO that uses The DAO’s 1.0 smart contracts will forfeit their ether into a refund address, to be divided among DAO token holders. Thus, DAO token holders could end up getting more than they put in. This is sure to anger those who have put their own money into their own DAOs using The DAO 1.0 code.  DAO tokenholders     As investors, and without the protection of a corporation, all 11,000+ DAO token holders may be seen as general partners in the fund. In that case, the attacker can sue individual DAO token holders in their own home jurisdictions, claiming that they represent the entity that seized his rightful property.  The Exchanges     Not long after the initial funding period, several cryptocurrency exchanges began making markets in DAO tokens.  As part of the chain, anyone who bought DAO tokens from any exchange may sue the exchange for selling flawed investments. This could go very deep – to the level of securities law violations, or they could simply be liable for the profit they made on the tokens.  Given that several exchanges have plenty of cash, they could be among the first targets.  The Ethereum Foundation     The Ethereum Foundation has a lot at stake here. They want the network to be rock solid, to support billions of dollars worth of commerce, and to be ""the operating system of the future"".  But now they are between a rock and a hard place: if they do nothing, the ethereum network suffers a setback that could take years to recover from; if they intervene, they set a dangerous precedent that erodes the social contract they set up with their network of independent nodes.  They didn’t design the ethereum network to be the judge and jury in case one or more parties are injured.  Miners and nodes     The 6,000+ full ethereum nodes may be liable for any forks they vote for.  If the attacker can be seen as having acquired his ether as a result of a ""feature"" of a smart contract, then he may (and has already threatened to) sue any of the miners that try to take what he feels is rightfully his away from him. He could also sue the Ethereum Foundation if they write the software that implements the fork.  On the other hand, DAO token holders could sue nodes that don’t vote for the fork, claiming that they aren’t doing the right thing. On the other hand, people running nodes like money, and they may get money from ""the attacker"" not to fork. It’s entirely possible that governments will step in here and try to make big changes in the governance of the Ethereum system.  The attacker     The attacker may already have made a substantial sum via market manipulation – this is illegal in many jurisdictions. He also may have a huge tax liability. There is obviously a tremendous incentive for the community to learn his identity and ""out"" him.  There is probably enough information out there for people to figure out who he is – it may just be a matter of time before they do.  The Aftermath  It seems at this point that The DAO will die, and that DAO token holders will get somewhere between 0% and 100% of their ether back.  It’s safe to say that the Slock.it guys have their hands full for a while, they may not get their project funded (I’m told they put quite a bit of their own money into The DAO), and they may be talking with lawyers for months.  The DAO is still subject to another similar attack.  Vitalik can propose an ethereum-based solution, but the nodes must decide. It’s not clear which of these paths the nodes will take. Many people say that ""doing nothing is perhaps the worst option"". It depends which side of various fences you’re on. There are slippery slopes everywhere.  There’s another wrinkle: The Ethereum Foundation is on track to switch to a new consensus mechanism called ""proof of stake"", and in that scenario, anyone who owns 14% of all ether will have tremendous control over the future blockchain.  In fact, Vitalik has asked for projects to have a limit of $10m or so, to help contain the magnitude of unintended errors.  It’s also very likely that there will be lawsuits. We could see a total mess, with lawsuits extending for many years. Or we could see a fairly neat and tidy ending, ethereum goes on and “the attacker” never surfaces again.  Though I would bet 5 ether that the attacker will be found within a month or two. Even though the letter and the spirit of smart contracts is that “smart contracts rule,” and the rule of law doesn’t apply – in this case, most people would like to see a do-over. I’m guessing we will see various rules of law apply.  I have tried to stick with the facts, and now I will offer one simple opinion: This situation will resolve itself well if the attacker will simply buy a bunch of ether, then agree to work with The DAO people to return the money to all tokenholders and dissolve The DAO completely.  The attacker will have made some money, made his point, no lawyers will be involved, we will all have learned a hard lesson, and the Ethereum Foundation can start planning for a safer, more resilient future.  Summary  I believe we can say that this event marks the beginning of a new era of ethereum’s public blockchain.  While the agile approach of ""ready, fire, aim"" generally works best with new software, it can be dangerous when $150m gets loaded into the chamber.  Ethereum was billed as a general-purpose computer and the harbinger of a new decentralized model for computing and for society. We will see, a bit sooner than we may have wanted, how all this plays out in the real world.

42399093,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiNlz,1466856005,Ethereum for the Overwhelmed Layman,"Jacob Eliosoff is a computer programmer who has also worked as a Wall Street quant and as a teacher. These days he runs Calibrated Markets LLC, a cryptocurrency algorithmic trading firm.  In this opinion piece, Eliosoff takes on the difficult task of explaining next-generation blockchain platform ethereum in everyday terms, outlining its strengths and weaknesses, and how these position it within the wider framework of blockchain innovation.  There are plenty of articles about ethereum's recent DAO drama and its wild price swings, but fewer try to explain to non-geeks how ethereum’s technology could matter for everyday life – and in particular, what it offers that bitcoin doesn't.  Let's walk through a concrete example: “slocks”, the Internet-ready locks being developed by now-infamous German startup Slock.it. Suppose you want to rent out your apartment while you’re on vacation.  Airbnb works fine, but it has drawbacks, like:  Fees. Airbnb charges 9-15%.  Handing off the key. What if you’re on an airplane? What if you have two guests staying one after the other? How do you prevent guest number 1 from entering during guest number 2's stay?  Limited payment options. If the guest doesn’t have an international credit or debit card, booking through Airbnb can be hard or even impossible. This may not seem like a big deal, but keep in mind that in many countries getting those cards is much harder.  One way to cut out Airbnb is to let your guest arrange the logistics – booking, payment, deposit, checking in and out – directly with the door lock itself. This requires a lock that isn’t just ""smart"" (electronic), but one that can handle these interactions with guests over the Internet, on terms specified by the host.  The guys at Slock.it call this a slock:  Without Airbnb, hosts and guests still need some kind of marketplace where they can find each other. In the slock framework, this is called the Universal Sharing Network ( USNhttp://download.slock.it/public/DAO/Proposal1.pdf). So, the guest agrees to the terms for the rental listed on the USN, sends payment to the host's slock, the slock grants door access and when the guest checks out the slock revokes his access and is ready for the next guest.  You can see Slock.it’s live demo of this at Devcon1 last November.  That’s a big-picture example of how ethereum could affect everyday life. Guests no longer need to deal directly with the host, or even with a company like Airbnb. Instead they deal with the USN (to find the room), and with the host's slock (to pay and get in). The host can enjoy her vacation, and while the USN charges a fee, it’s more like 1-2% than Airbnb’s 9-15%.  How can the USN charge so much less? Because it’s a robot. And its owner’s a robot, too.  Where does ethereum fit in here?  That first diagram glossed over a bunch of subtleties.  Here’s a more detailed look:  Perhaps the most frequent confusion here is that the slock isn’t actually a single piece of hardware – nor is it what Slock.it makes or sells! The slock is what you get by combining a standard consumer smart lock, like the Danalock unit in Slock.it’s demo, with an ""Ethereum Computer"", a small device able to communicate both with the lock (via industry-standard protocols like Z-Wave or ZigBee) and with the USN and its listings and contracts.  It’s the latter piece, the Ethereum Computer, that constitutes Slock.it’s product. The remaining magic – and here we get to ethereum’s true role – is that the USN marketplace isn’t just a cheaper knockoff of Airbnb, but something fundamentally different.  The USN isn’t a company. It doesn’t even have staff! It’s automated, a computer program.  But it’s not even a regular computer program. Really it’s a bunch of programs – each rental listing is its own program, for instance, sending and receiving payments according to the logic programmed into it: deposit amount, checkout time and so on.  And unlike, say, Airbnb’s website, these programs don’t run on any specific server but rather on many computers, ""nodes"" connected to form a decentralized network (like BitTorrent). This network is ethereum, and the special, payment-slinging programs it's running are also known as smart contracts.  These smart contracts can both send and receive payments, to and from both people (guests and hosts) and each other. But they do this not via the credit card or bank networks, but via the ethereum network itself, and not in dollars or euros but in ether (ETH), ethereum’s own digital currency.  Payments between the guest, the slock and the host are in ether, though the USN may list prices in dollars and convert at purchase time using the current rate, like an FX rate. Currently 1 ETH is worth about $14, up from less than $1 in December, which explains a lot of the hype.  The final bit of alphabet soup we haven’t touched on yet is The DAO.  The DAO is a tangled tale and pretty much burnt to the ground last Friday, but for here, suffice to say that The DAO is an entity that owns the USN and pockets the 1-2% rental fees above. It, too, is neither flesh-and-blood, brick-and-mortar, nor CEO-and-lawyer, but yet another smart contract running on ethereum.  Why not bitcoin?  The big question you’d run into with bitcoin is – where does the Airbnb-type software run? There has to be some program receiving bookings via the USN, checking in guests, refunding deposits and so on. What hardware would it run on?  In ethereum, the answer is that this software, in the form of smart contracts, runs on the computers participating in the network. Running these contracts is what it means to run an Ethereum “node”, much like running BitTorrent means agreeing to store and distribute BitTorrent files.  So, buying one of Slock.it’s “Ethereum Computers” lets you run the Airbnb software, or any other smart contract. That same node might also run software to rent out your car, or run an online casino, or conduct an election. That’s why Slock.it call it an “Ethereum Computer” rather than just a “Slock Computer” - it’s general-purpose. Bitcoin nodes aren’t like this: they only run a specific kind of program, which pretty much just lets you send money.  So, either you'd run the ""Bitbnb"" software on a separate server of your own (or on a special-purpose ""Bitbnb Computer""), or you’d need someone to build a layer on top of bitcoin that supports smart contracts, the way the web is a layer built on top of the Internet.  Counterparty and RootStock are two smart-contract projects building on top of bitcoin this way. But, Counterparty bundles its state (how much the guest owes you, etc) into bitcoin transactions, which weren’t designed for this purpose.  This also limits Counterparty transactions to bitcoin’s 10-minute block time, rather than ethereum’s 15-second one. Meanwhile, RootStock is far behind ethereum in development, arguably falling further behind every day, and involves some technical challenges (how to reliably transfer coins between the bitcoin blockchain and RootStock blockchain) that don’t appear to be fully worked out yet.  In both cases, you’re now dependent on two separate networks and technologies: bitcoin, and Counterparty or RootStock.  So yes, you could do it with bitcoin. But it gets clunky.  It’s a bit like saying, you can turn a wall clock into an alarm clock, by attaching a device that detects the positions of the hands and rings a bell. But why not just own a smartphone, and download an alarm app? That’s the power of a general-purpose computer.  Not quite a sure thing  Ethereum can do things bitcoin can’t, but there are still umpteen ways both the slock idea and ethereum itself could fail to get traction.  Hardware. Slock.it is in the hardware game, and hardware is tough. We’ve seen from ASIC manufacturers how tricky this is.  Network effect. Even supposing good, cheap hardware, how many people are going to choose to buy and set up an unfamiliar physical device rather than join Airbnb’s millions of users, just to save a few percent on the fees?  Overhyped automation. Slock advocates, and ethereum advocates in general, tend to gloss over all the tasks that can’t be automated. When the host claims the guest broke her TV, no robot can decide whether he gets his deposit back or not. Smart contracts usually can’t eliminate human involvement, only streamline it.  Still in beta. Ethereum is an exceptionally ambitious project, and many of its core features (proof-of-stake, sharding, etc) still aren’t fully designed, nevermind implemented; that’s a lot of places development could get stuck. Slocks and the USN are even more embryonic. Even assuming healthy progress, ethereum and smart contracts will always be much more complex than bitcoin, with a larger ""attack surface” for hackers.  Shortage of use cases. Few of the many proposed ethereum use cases seem likely to win over customers anytime soon: slocks are one of the most persuasive I’ve seen, and they’re pretty esoteric. Given that bitcoin has simple, compelling uses like remittances and online purchases, yet has still struggled with user adoption, one wonders how many people actually want to eat what the ethereum chefs are cooking.  The DAO is a mess. While I see ethereum as a good idea that may not pan out, and slocks as a riskier but still plausible business plan, The DAO made me shake my head even before its tragicomic undoing last weekend. Beyond the superficial bugs, it suffers from numerous incentive problems and its premise – that crowds are good at deciding how to invest capital – seems fundamentally wrong. And even if it did make good investments, calling shares “tokens” was just not going to fool the SEC.  Some predictions  But, then again opining about a technology without making any concrete predictions is mighty easy.  So here are a few:  Unlike most cryptocoins, which will gradually fade away, at least one of bitcoin and ethereum is here to stay – though quite possibly not both. By the end of 2017, either BTC will hit $2,000 or ETH will hit $120.  Despite bitcoin’s head-start, unless its developers start healing their divisions, ethereum’s market cap will surpass it by end of 2017. Right now, ethereum looks on track to adopt proof-of-stake before bitcoin supports 10 transactions per second. That is an embarrassing reflection on their paces of development.  The DAO is dead: Even if it pulls through this month’s crisis, further technical and regulatory minefields await. The “hard fork” plan will carry the day, returning its investors’ ether (though 20+% of them won’t even get around to withdrawing it), but that will be the end of it. Slock.it are a likely casualty as well, their funding model and credibility in shreds. But ethereum will lick its wounds and carry on.  Ethereum and bitcoin adoption will remain piecemeal. Contrary to 2013's dreams, this is a game of decades, not months. When it does come, adoption won’t spread gradually but will suddenly take off in one or two centers of activity. For bitcoin some candidates are Philippine remittances, Chinese or Venezuelan capital control evaders, online poker sites or of course the next big Silk Road. For ethereum it’s still early, but projects like Slock.it that “disrupt the disruptors” (Airbnb, Uber, etc) seem most straightforward.  Although harder to measure than price, the most important yardstick for ethereum is user adoption.  Like bitcoin, ethereum has some paths to success that don’t rely on users: for example, sovereign wealth funds could start diversifying into cryptocurrencies. But to succeed as a technology, ethereum needs non-geeks to start using it, not because they think it’s cool but because it fulfills some practical need better than the alternatives.  The bitcoin precedent is somewhat depressing: over seven years bitcoin has won many fans – techies, libertarians, speculators, venture capitalists, vendors – but few regular users. Ethereum’s success probably depends less on transforming society in 20 years than on making someone’s life easier now.
