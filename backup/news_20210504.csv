Earlier, ether and dogecoin touched new all-time high prices.      U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a catalyst for the midday sell-off after she warned that interest rates may need to rise. Some traders apparently sold on concerns the cheap money era might not last forever.    Ether (ETH) trading around $3,369 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,237-$3,530 (CoinDesk 20)  Dogecoin (DOGE) doubles in price, trading around 0.57 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Jumping 38.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $54,591 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $53,633-$57,356 (CoinDesk 20)    Ether was trading around $3,369 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up 3.4% over the prior 24 hours after falling to as low as $3,168 a few hours earlier.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had hit a record high earlier on Tuesday, surging to $3,530 around 14:30 UTC (9:30 a.m. ET). That is over $200 more than the previous record, set Monday, of $3,300. ETH is above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.      There seems to be some fascination among ether traders with the $3,000 level, noted Alessandro Andreotti, a trader in the over-the-counter crypto market.      “ETH has taken the spotlight for shattering the $3,000 barrier,” he said.      In addition to record high prices, ether’s volumes are also hitting records. In fact, according to data from CoinDesk Research, ether’s exchange volume was higher than that of bitcoin to start the week. On Monday, spot exchange volume for ether tallied $61 billion, with the spot BTC market changing hands at $52 billion.      Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto market maker GSR, says ether and bitcoin are now behaving as very separate assets, which normally isn’t the case.      ""There’s a disconnect between BTC and ETH,” Rosenblum told CoinDesk.      This disconnect could lead to ether heading up further, according to Nick Spanos, co-founder of decentralized finance startup Zap Protocol.      “From the pace ETH has gathered in recent days, its continued growth path is certain, and levels above $5,000"" represent the new target, Spanos said.      Spanos also noted that ether’s dominance, or its share of the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, is now approaching 18%. That's the highest it has been since 2018 at the end of the previous big cryptocurrency bull run.      “The current all-time high over $3,500 has reignited the ambitious sentiment that ethereum may eventually flip bitcoin by market capitalization in the near future,” noted Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of crypto exchange CEX.IO.

The cryptocurrency, which is known for its memeable Shiba Inu dog character, now has a market capitalization of over $72 billion, according to data aggregator CoinGecko.      Over-the-counter trader Alessandro Andreotti said the prominence of Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has advocated for dogecoin in the past, may have investors salivating for a fundamental event occurring later this week. “I think investors are bullish for Elon Musk's upcoming appearance on 'Saturday Night Live.' Absolutely.”      Musk will host ""Saturday Night Live"" this week on May 8 at 04:30 UTC Sunday (11:30 p.m. ET Saturday).

BTC is below the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.      “So far, BTC has stayed relatively stable while [altcoins] have continued to climb,” said trader Alessandro Andreotti.      While it does feel as if bitcoin’s day-to-day price changes have been stable, its 60-day volatility is moving up, rising from a recent low of 45% April 15. It is currently at over 64% as of Monday’s closing data. By comparison, the S&P 500’s 30-day volatility stands at a little over 10%, according to CoinDesk Research.    Traditional markets sell off    Bitcoin’s fall Tuesday may have been exacerbated by the traditional markets.      While Asia and Europe were mixed for the day, U.S. stocks have slipped on the possibility of higher interest rates, which Treasury Secretary Yellen mentioned on Tuesday. The fall in stocks was followed by a slip in many crypto assets.      “The crypto market appears to be entering a cyclical phase away from beta and into stock-picking mode,” noted Vishal Shah, founder of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Alpha5, referring to the move away from quant trading.    The Nikkei 225 index in Japan was closed for a holiday Tuesday. Singapore’s SGX ended its day in the green 0.29%, boosted by news of high share buybacks in April.  In Europe, the FTSE 100 closed down 0.67% as investors were concerned about the coronavirus situation in India, where over 30% of new cases are now originating.  The U.S. S&P 500 index slipped 0.70% with a major sell-off over possible interest rate increases, but they did recover despite tech stocks, including Apple, taking losses.

42386624,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBUP7b,1620158240,New York Bill Would Freeze Bitcoin Miners Pending Environmental Review,"A new bill in the New York state legislature seeks to place a three-year moratorium on crypto mining pending an environmental review by the state.      The bill, from state Sen. Kevin S. Parker (D-Brooklyn), would lift the moratorium only for mining facilities that “will not adversely affect” New York’s carbon-cutting benchmarks. The legislation is in its earliest stages and was referred to the Senate’s environment committee Monday.      If passed, the bill would empower state inspectors to evaluate the impact mining facilities have on water quality, air quality, carbon emissions and wildlife. Miners would be allowed back online only after they complete an environmental impact statement. Those deemed to be hurting New York’s carbon-cutting plans would be nixed.      Parker’s bill comes as state power plants roar back from their grave as bitcoin mining operations. In the Finger Lakes region in upstate New York, for example, a long-dormant coal plant now burns 19 megawatts worth of natural gas to feed its armada of power-hungry mining rigs.

The state is seeking to slash its greenhouse gas emissions 70% by 2030. Burning more natural gas kneecaps that effort, advocates say.      They also question the wisdom of allowing a plant that could power nearby homes to mine bitcoin instead.      The fight over Greenidge’s expansion plan foreshadowed what could be a monumental blow to New York’s miners – one that if successful would freeze every commercial mining operation in the state and likely threaten those found to be irreconcilable with the state's climate and environmental goals.      Just two weeks ago, the operator convinced local politicians to approve its expansion plan without subjecting it to an environmental review. Environmentalists were aghast. The politicians said they were too. But their hands were tied by state law.

42434328,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBV7h,1620156009,The 5 NFT Trends to Watch,"The NFT train has left the station. Or so you could be forgiven for thinking.      The massive excitement of the last three months around non-fungible tokens is settling into a more substantive operating reality. The initial surge of interest is starting to wobble, looking for long-term footing.      Google search volume on NFTs, once matching the 2017 level of interest in the initial coin offering boom, is down about 40%. Either people just know what NFTs are and are no longer learning about it for the first time, or the novelty is fading.      According to The Block and Crypto Art data, monthly Ethereum NFT platform volumes have gone from $200 million to $100 million. If you include NBA TopShot on Flow, that adds another $25 million to $50 million in weekly volume, down from a $150 million weekly peak. The number of transactions and engaged users is staying roughly steady – 400,000 monthly average users on NBA TopShot and several thousand around the rest of Web3. But the initial moment of discovery seems to be behind us.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    That’s what we would have observed of CryptoKitties in December 2017 only to be entirely wrong about 2021.      As an example, we wrote this fairly prescient piece in 2019, and it felt very uncomfortable and futuristic in that moment. But if someone took action and financially engaged with CryptoPunks or SuperRare or Murat Pak’s Archillect then, he or she would have made a life-changing return. In 2020, Dapper Labs followed CryptoKitties with TopShot, while the Ethereum ecosystem added hundreds of new companies and protocols as well as thousands of creators and collectors. More importantly, NFTs have changed the nature of the conversation about the internet and creativity, injecting economic markets and sustainable models that do not rely on advertising or streaming but do rely on authentic, engaged communities.    Endgame    Another point of context is to think about ICOs. Today, most people think back to that period as one of irrationality and bad decision making. We do not. Rather, we think of it as the right ideas with a lot of bad execution at an early stage.      The core idea that applications can be built as protocols on an open-source network and replace the nature of the firm, especially as it relates to media and finance, in fact did happen and continues to succeed. If we remove the line between token offering fundraising and the adoption of decentralized finance, we can see that the more grounded DeFi use cases implemented and made real the hallucinations of the ICO period. There is no growth without watering the garden.    Read more: How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT    We can borrow the analogy of an “endgame” from video games. The majority of players will buy the game and play it some part of the way to the end, and some portion of people will finish the full content. However, there will be a dedicated subset of people for whom the game becomes a social environment, with markers of status and wealth determined through digital labor. These players will outrank the vast majority of normal people, and interact with the game on another level.Few understand the nerd top 1%.      Instead of 20 hours, they may be spending 2,000 hours in this virtual environment. This is the endgame, and it is often carefully designed to keep the game elites hooked. New patterns and ideas can emerge during the development for these fanatics, and those ideas then get re-integrated into casual use.      For Ethereum, NFTs are currently the endgame. The reason CryptoPunks continue to hold $50,000 and much more in value is because they are the social and cultural symbol of the participants in the Ethereum money games. During Crypto Winter, the profitable thing to do on Ethereum was to speculate and trade deeply discounted tokens. If you navigated that well, it leveled you up for higher risk taking, speculation and network participation in the current environment.      And so those who have won sufficient capital appreciation are able to self-express and signal to others that they are playing the game on another level. It is this group of people that is spending $70 million on Beeple pieces, and pulling the concepts of the Metaverse into the real world. Here’s a flavor of how the Ethereum endgame is bleeding out to the rest of the real world.      Having established the scene, let’s take a pause to think about what long-term operating progress looks like. What should be our NFT thesis for the next few years? Here are our top five trends.    Incumbent media and enterprise IP networks    When the token market crashed in 2018, much of the crypto industry reverted to institutional enablement models. That meant delivering private, permissioned networks and protocols to support the use cases of large financial, governmental or commercial entities. This led to the creation of large digital asset and consulting initiatives (e.g., R3, IBM, Digital Asset) that focused on converting traditional economic activity to a controlled blockchain version.      The outcome to date is an acceleration in the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies and blockchain-based institutional capital markets and supply chains. The old world needs to be pulled into the new world, and it can get you paid.      The same thing will happen with traditional media. Large incumbent owners and publishers of media properties across art, music and film are going to massively explore the NFT space. Unlike financial firms, which are subject to regulated compliance, media companies are by nature creative. Their engagement with blockchain technology is likely to yield new permutations of what NFTs mean and how they can create value in an overall brand experience. So instead of asking how to narrow the scope of technology, media enterprises will ask and suggest how to broaden it.      Efforts like Palm from ConsenSys, featuring the art of Damien Hirst, as well as the continued growth of Flow and its institutional partners are symptoms of this vector of change. Getting Eminem to “drop” on Nifty Gateway or Snoop Dogg to be involved with Nyan Cat is the same thing. Familiar creative output – whether packaged into media conglomerates or well-known celebrities – will keep pouring into Web3.    Generative art and blockchain-as-medium    Art and creative output are reflections of the medium in which they are built. The palettes and instruments determine what people are able to make. Blockchain-based digital objects today are a pretty simple translation of Web 2.0 picture and video files to economically scarce versions of the same. This version of it is a moment in time, just like the skeumorphic design of the early iPhone, which looked like pictures of bookshelves and paper notepads, was replaced by flat and convenient icons that make software easier to use.      What this means is that future creative objects on Web3 will relate to the native attributes of Web3. Those are its digital economic systems, the programmatic nature of time (i.e., blocks) and the graph shape of its nodes and addresses. Imagine Ethereum as a giant clock, with all the mechanical parts exposed, and click into those gears new interactive elements that are owned by the community. That’s a bit more like it.      For example of things in this nature, look at Async Art (and Async Music), Art Blocks, EthBlock.art, EulerBeats, Hic et Nunc, as well as the Murat Pak Fungible drop on Nifty Gateway. These are not mere translations of videos anchored to an encrypted identifier. Rather, the works use the medium as an input.    Read more: ‘I’m Obsessed’: Paris Hilton on NFTs, Empowering Female Creators and the Future of Art    In the case of Async, both the visual pieces and the music pieces are cut into layers that can be owned by different entities. They may choose different states or components of the whole and force exchange around it. Investment funds or communities may battle out for some particular permutation of an art piece or song. This outcome uses ownership as part of the medium.    Digital Museums, DAOs and the Metaverse    The communal aspects of this economy are also becoming digitized at the edges. Software-defined investment collectives, called decentralized autonomous organizations, can form in days to bid hundreds of thousands of dollars on the purchase of popular creative expressions.      One such NFT example is a video created by Pplpleasr, originally built for promoting Uniswap but sold for the #StandWithAsians movement in response to the Atlanta shootings. The piece garnered a $525,000 sale to a DAO self-organized for the purpose of acquiring the work.    Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?    This is far from the only art DAO – examples include Flamingo DAO, BeetsDAO, $WhaleDAO, among various others. Such groups own gallery vaults of culturally relevant digital objects, sometimes with the vaults being fully tokenized and traded as pseudo NFTs.      This financial structuring can be done quickly, because of Ethereum’s underlying interoperability – NFTs can be sent to certain addresses and locked, new tokens can be issued that are collateralized by and redeemable into those NFTs, and so on. This is hard to accomplish in the “real world.” In the decentralized world, such things can be built in months. Check out B20, the tokenized Beeple fund from Metakovan, and NFTX, the CryptoPunks fund makers, as examples.      Further, it is not only acquisition that is communal but also appreciation and engagement of the art. Once bought, digital objects can be installed and showcased in a variety of digital worlds, from Cryptovoxels to Decentraland. These virtual worlds can be built on like in Minecraft or Roblox. However, they are also carved up into scarce real estate, and such real estate can be exchanged and purchased, which implies economic activity around cultural objects.    What it means to own NFTs: IPFS and multi-chain support    What do you actually own with an NFT, they say? What is an NFT, really? For a useful starting overview, see this description from the Ethereum foundation. The short answer is you own a reference to a file stored elsewhere, with both that reference and that file maximally secured and decentralized. But it’s complicated.      It’s complicated because each Ethereum-based platform (i.e., Nifty Gateway, Super Rare, Rarible, Foundation, etc.) may have slightly different ways of dealing with minting, burning and exchange. They code their smart contracts to adhere to standards but there are still implementation differences. Most likely the NFT will contain a reference to where the file is stored on IPFS, a protocol for decentralized file storage. That means if your particular website provider goes out of business, your file will still persist in the swirling chaos of the internet.      Even more complicated is the popularity of NFTs on non-Ethereum platforms, because they are not sufficiently decentralized to generate a trusted property rights system. We had mentioned Flow, the software powering NBA TopShot. It is unclear what happens to your digital object if Dapper Labs ceases to exist and all the privately run Flow nodes go offline. A similar statement can be made about Binance Smart Chain. But we do see Tezos, and the Hic et Nunc project, also using IPFS as the file storage backbone. So perhaps the answer will be that IPFS secures NFTs even in the multichain world. Perhaps this is why Filecoin is worth $10 billion in market capitalization.      Understanding this mechanic reveals one of the core thematics for digital objects.    Integration into DeFi and portfolio management    Lastly, we remind the reader that digital objects are an economic expression of cultural labor. Art in the physical world or, alternately, the mechanical rights to a song, generate financial returns and plug into financial reporting.      One can own a museum full of art and think of it entirely as a slice in an asset allocation rather than as beauty tethered to canvas – an asset class worth about $2 trillion. See our prior discussion on this framing here.      To that end, we expect to see both traditional and emerging art plug into traditional and emerging financial systems. By now the financial world is building bridges in earnest to on-ramp customers into bitcoin and crypto assets – whether through exchange-traded funds, Paxos-based PayPal accounts, or financial adviser providers like Onramp Invest. Financial systems will similarly need to package and integrate NFT-based assets into portfolio management systems and familiar asset allocations.      This might not matter for the first generation of crypto investors playing against each other in the endgame, but it will for almost everyone else. Companies like Lobus are exploring this space, and bridging the gap between existing and emerging art and its financialization. You can see a similar set of functionality in Zapper for NFTs already, which provides a mark-to-market price across your fungible and non-fungible portfolio.      We conclude with the obvious, which is that all of these creative objects will plug into decentralized finance across the spectrum of use cases. They will be useful as collateral for borrowing or fractionalized for investment or attached to fixed income instruments or used as governance and participation tokens. NFTs will be symptoms of living, breathing, collaborative communities, powered by the financial machinations of decentralized economies, driving novel user experiences and narratives.

42434320,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBUth,1620151283,The Reflexivity of ‘Number Go Up’ Technology,"Ether (ETH) is on a tear (more than $3,200 at the time of writing) and it’s not hard to see why. Last month, ConsenSys economist (and CoinDesk columnist) Lex Sokolin said recent price action in ETH is the result of years of building. There are more Ethereum-based products than ever, more users and more ways for people to deploy their capital, earn yield and have fun.      “The price action that people are excited about – that's the result of custodians and financial infrastructure firms and wallets put into place over the past several years,” he said on CoinDesk TV.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Sokolin is pointing to a cycle of legitimacy where the driving ideas and promises of Ethereum, the so-called “world computer,” are actually being encoded. These tools help justify the price of ETH in a similar way traditional investors value a company stock by examining its balance sheet.      But there’s another factor at play in Sokolin’s reading: the excitement he mentioned in the first half of that quote. People are generally “excited” by the price of ether, not just the network itself. Price drives interest, which reflexively drives higher prices.      See also: Michael Casey – Dogecoin and the New Meaning of Money    Cryptocurrencies are opening up the space to reimagine what money is and can be. It’s part of what many now refer to as the “meme economy,” where human psychology and fads are as important as economic fundamentals. (BitPanda, for example, is hiring a meme “ lord/ladyhttps://jobs.lever.co/bitpanda/8ce5bced-bded-4872-8310-2f7123c0b1cb.”)    While meme-driven finance may seem new – like a peculiar offspring of decades of loose monetary policy, increasing internet usage and being cooped inside during a global pandemic – many see this economic activity as rooted in some of the most primitive human behavior.      In seeking to explain the “ponzinomics” of token systems, several market analysts – like Tony Sheng and Deribit’s Matti – have taken up the theories of mimetics and reflexivity rooted in the work of 20th century philosopher Rene Girard.      Memetic analysis seems anything but scientific, but for Girard it’s the secret to understanding most human behaviors and cultural formation. Matti gives a crash course definition of Girard’s main idea: “A human [is] a lifelong child that desires the toy someone else has just picked up.” In other words, people often don’t know what they want until they see what someone else has.      Girard’s most famous student, Peter Thiel, was thinking of mimetic theory when investing in Facebook. Social networks are playgrounds where human desires, envies and competitions are on full display.      Applying mimetic theory to crypto, Deribit’s Matti argues that a cryptocurrency’s price is a meme. It may be a way to judge actual network activity but it’s also a signal of what other people find desirable.      “Price makes memes concrete,” coder and writer Rachel-Rose O’Leary said in a direct message. “In crypto we have our own words for this: FUD and FOMO. In a cyclical, almost seasonal pattern, FUD gives way to FOMO – fear gives way to mimetic desire.”      Crypto, more than most economic activity, is future oriented. While the code may be deployed today, the real story is the promise of disruption tomorrow, or what O’Leary calls an “overall preference for narrative.”      See also: Emily Parker – Why We Should Take Dogecoin Seriously      People buy into the idea that Ethereum is the world computer or that bitcoin is a global reserve currency. Not today, but tomorrow. And ultimately, as Matti says, it is the aggregate of active observers that ""decides what reflexive assets will become.""      Price gives people a reason to believe, a story to invest in and an object to desire – as long as it’s going up. But reflexivity works in the opposite direction, too.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | DOGE | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/04/the-reflexivity-of-number-go-up-technology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/953dee3f57ba5d916220a01745cbfa8f3c1ca052-1638x1136.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434321,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBUrh,1620145744,M&A Using Crypto? Here's How to Make It Work,"The idea of using cryptocurrency as the means of payment in a merger or acquisition (M&A) will give most business people – and their lawyers and investment bankers – nightmares and cold sweats. But given the accelerated pace of adoption and the rapid, recent price surge in many currencies, it’s only a matter of time until we see some buyers and sellers rolling the dice on this approach to making deals.      While the widespread use of this practice is not even on the horizon, the question is when, not if, a few bold souls make news (and possibly history) by using cryptocurrency as payment in a M&A deal. (Based on published reports, a few have already tried this, albeit on a much smaller scale and before cryptocurrency was on the radar of global finance.)    Joe Castelluccio is a partner at Mayer Brown LLP and counsels clients on M&A financing and other corporate and business matters.    There are plenty of reasons not to use cryptocurrency as payment in an M&A transaction, including lack of price certainty and limited (but growing) usability as a means of exchange. But these challenges, as we show below, are not insurmountable.      As background, in most M&A deals there is a time delay between when the deal is signed/announced – i.e., when the deal value is largely fixed – and when it is closed. If the deal value is expressed as a cryptocurrency, the actual value (based on changes to the crypto/fiat currency exchange rate) may fluctuate significantly during this sign-to-close period.      Here are a few ways dealmakers are likely to solve for this.    Collar it    Parties can put a collar around the exchange rate of the cryptocurrency to be used in the deal to provide parties with some fixed measure of value in the deal. If the exchange rate (to U.S. dollars or other fiat currency) shifts greater than ""X"" percentage above/below the target exchange rate, the deal consideration could either be supplemented by fiat currency or shift completely to fiat currency.    Read more: Crypto M&A Doubled to $1.1B in 2020: PwC    Alternatively, the collar could establish a cap and floor and maximum ""price"" that would be paid, which essentially caps the amount of exchange rate movement between signing and closing. This type of collar is often used – for the same reason – in transactions where the ""price"" paid is in the form of stock. This approach may be a baby step toward use of cryptocurrency as consideration because it provides some backstop of certainty on the value that will be exchanged at closing.    Convert it    Another approach would be to stipulate a menu of cryptocurrencies that may be used to pay the purchase price at closing, while specifying the deal value/purchase price in U.S. dollars or some other fiat currency This approach would allow one or both parties to ""convert"" the fixed value to be exchanged into cryptocurrencies for the actual transfer of value at closing. By pre-selecting a limited menu of currencies that can be used for this purpose – either one or several from the menu – parties would have some flexibility to react to market fluctuations as the time for closing becomes more certain (e.g., to avoid certain cryptocurrencies that may be in the midst of a short-term or particularly wild price swing).    Pause it    A third approach would see parties building into their transaction agreement a unilateral right to delay a closing by a short, fixed time period (i.e., one to three days) to allow the price of the cryptocurrency to be used in the deal to stabilize (if in the midst of a particularly drastic price move around the anticipated closing date).      For example, in a recent 48-hour time period (over a weekend, no less), the bitcoin/U.S. dollar exchange rate fell by more than 15%. If M&A parties had been planning on a Friday for a closing the following Monday, the value to be exchanged at closing would have been drastically different from the anticipated value (and bargained-for value) just one business day prior.      In this example, giving a party the right to pause the closing for 72 hours would (theoretically) allow time for the market and price to stabilize. (There may be other reasons that a unilateral delay may not be practical. These considerations would need to be balanced with other mechanisms for mitigating price swings.)    Wrapping up    Cryptocurrencies are rapidly becoming accepted across industries as a means of storing and transferring value. With this ever-widening universe of crypto adoption, it’s more likely we’ll see a significant transaction using some form of crypto, whether because parties think it is an efficient way to transfer value or because a significant crypto player wants to blaze new ground.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Joe Castelluccio,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/04/ma-using-crypto-heres-how-to-make-it-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f13776be6b2b0399e33e943d121c5017e7c8beed-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dogecoin (DOGE), the fourth-most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, according to Messari, made an all-time high around $0.60 on Tuesday and is now trading around $0.53 at the time of writing.      Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was surging for a 10th straight daily gain, potentially tying its longest winning streak in history, and pushed Tuesday to a new all-time high price over $3,500.      But many cryptocurrency traders flocking to Robinhood to place orders may have instead learned that service was disrupted.      In a tweet, Robinhood assured users that it was working to resolve the issue as soon as possible:      This isn’t the first time Robinhood has experienced platform issues. In January, Robinhood blocked trading in volatile stocks including GameStop and AMC during the buying frenzy prompted by Reddit group r/WallStreetBets. The trading app faced lawsuits following the blockage.      In April, Robinhood faced technical issues due to heightened cryptocurrency trading volumes during a near 15% sell-off in bitcoin (BTC).      According to Tuesday's tweet, traders can visit status.robinhood.com for real-time updates.

Since its debut on April 3, FEI has mostly traded below its goal of parity with the U.S. dollar. From April 7 to April 20, it stayed below $0.80, more than 20% off its peg, according to data on CoinGecko.      Things started to turn around on April 20, when the price began to rise toward the goal. Tuesday morning, FEI finally hit $1. It remains to be seen if FEI can hold this price.      FEI’s chief innovation is a concept called “protocol controlled value” (PCV), which is supposed to hold the price steady in a decentralized way that's more capital-efficient than other stablecoins. Its chief competitor in this regard is the stablecoin issued by MakerDAO, DAI.      The FEI project was funded by a group of elite investors, such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Coinbase Ventures and Framework Ventures.      Prior to its launch, FEI recruited liquidity into its system with a launch event that promised discounted FEI and opportunities to earn its governance token, TRIBE, in exchange for ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency. The launch attracted over $1 billion worth of ETH.      Although FEI has finally reached its goal of a $1 price, its supply on the market has decreased significantly. According to CoinGecko, its market cap was $1.9 billion on April 29. That fell precipitously to $976 million by April 30.      There is currently $1 billion in FEI on the market.      Since the launch, the TRIBE governance token has traded between $2.45 and $1.04. As of this writing, it is at $1.59.      The FEI team could not be immediately reached for comment.

The second-largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $3,500 at press time, for a 2% rise since 0:00 coordinated universal time (8 p.m. ET Monday). If the gains are held through the daily close (23:59 UTC), ether would cement a 10-day winning trend, the longest since early January 2018, according to Coinbase data.      Ether (ETH), which is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, has nearly quintupled this year, in a rally fueled by speculation over the future of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, as well as other use cases like non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. There's also mounting evidence of robust growth in transaction volumes and other network metrics, as documented in a May 3 tweet by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.      In 2021, the cryptocurrency has outshone the larger bitcoin (BTC), which has doubled so far this year. Ether's market value has now topped $400 billion, but it's still well behind the $1.04 trillion for bitcoin.      The rising popularity of ether futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) shows institutions are seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency via derivatives markets.      Open interest in the CME futures, or the amount of outstanding positions, rose to a record high of $473 million on Monday, marking a 23-fold increase since the first-day tally of $20 million, per data provider Skew. Ether futures went live on the CME on Feb. 8.      On Monday, some $581 million of ether futures contracts changed hands on the CME, up 17-fold since the debut.      The CME data demonstrates the increasing influence of institutional money in the market, according to analysts at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx.      ""Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures are one of the primary ways that institutional investors can get exposure to crypto,"" Coin Metrics' weekly newsletter published on Tuesday said.

The early-stage backer just secured funding for another $100 million in Multicoin bets.      The Austin, Texas-based crypto investment firm went public Tuesday with its second fund in four years. Backed by undisclosed institutional liquidity providers (LP) and a smattering of crypto founders, the fund is already “active,” said Jain.      Multicoin is looking to turn that activity into Helium-sized wins. Multicoin’s first fund went long and large on the internet-of-things startup in 2019, and in the past 12 months reaped the token’s 6,800%+ return. It’s one of the “weird and different” projects Jain seeks out.      News of Multicoin's new fund comes on the heels of a reported $1 billion crypto venture fund from VC giant Andreessen Horowitz. With leading coins near or above all-time highs and Coinbase surging on the Nasdaq, the timing is right for new capital to hit the market.      Multicoin prefers “making investments that are in categories that people are not taking seriously yet, or don't realize,” Jain said.

A blog post said Venture II bets can be as small as $500,000 or stretch into the hundreds of millions of dollars if Multicoin’s hedge fund gets involved. There’s a preference for early-stage companies as well as those with tokens.      Jain said he wants to back blockchain startups building “sovereign software” for a broad user base.

42434324,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBUzh,1620136800,DeFi Conglomerate Equilibrium Raises $8.5M to Win a Place on Polkadot,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Equilibrium has raised around $8.5 million as part of the process to launch its suite of services on the Polkadot network.      Equilibrium, which calls itself a “DeFi conglomerate,” including lending, stablecoins and swaps, raised the funds over two rounds: $5.5 million was raised back in September and more recently, $2.5 million was raised from investors including CMS Holdings, LD Capital and Signum Capital.      DeFi is booming, and its growing ecosystem is looking beyond Ethereum to scaling solutions and alternative chains. Polkadot operates distinct parachains where projects will build applications connected by a relay mechanism, and is an attractive option – so attractive that an auction process will be held this year for projects to snag one of the 100 parachain slots.    Read more: DeFi Is Now a $100B Sector    Equilibrium CEO Alex Melikhov pointed out that winning a parachain slot on Polkadot is rather expensive (1 million DOT, or approximately $34 million), but that the two-step “parachain lease offering” has got the project well on the road to achieving that goal.      “We have accomplished the first phase, a straightforward swap between DOT tokens and our EQ token,” Melikhov said in an interview, adding:    “We had set the high cap for the first phase at 250,000 DOT. The hard cap for the second crowd loan phase is 750,00 DOT, which will progress as the auctions arrive on the Polkadot network around July/August.”    The funds being raised will be held in cold storage by Copper, a London-based cryptocurrency custodian, and Signum Capital will also act as a multisig gatekeeper, Melikhov said. Participants supporting the network will earn 7% return for staking their DOT, plus a further 18% APY generated from Equilibrium tokens given as rewards.    Read more: DeFi’s Curve Finance Is Branching Out to Polkadot    Building a DeFi platform that does the full gamut of bank-like functions (think Maker or Synthetix on Ethereum) makes sense when you are starting out on a greenfield like Polkadot, said Melikhov, who has experience building DeFi from scratch within the EOS ecosystem.      “Bootstrapping DeFi on EOS was a really good experience, and we would love to replicate that on Polkadot, which is a slightly similar situation because nothing is in production yet,” Melikhov said. “To be honest, there’s a lot more interest in what we are building on Polkadot than there was on EOS and a much larger amount of investors.”      UPDATE (May 4, 15:10 UTC): Modifies language around Equilibrium's September 2020 fundraise.",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/04/defi-conglomerate-equilibrium-raises-85m-to-win-a-place-on-polkadot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/821fffabb4051438c13dbd5e6a1a455ec596bd2c-1400x821.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434325,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBV1h,1620135000,State of Crypto: The Bitcoin Fog Indictment Shows the Permanence of User Data,"Last week, U.S. Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) agents arrested the alleged operator behind crypto mixing service Bitcoin Fog. An attached “Statement of Facts” helpfully explains how the feds tracked the operator down, but raises new questions about how exactly they uncovered this information.      You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.    Tracking you  The narrative    Last week, U.S. officials arrested Roman Sterlingov on allegations he operated Bitcoin Fog, a service designed to obscure bitcoin transactions so external parties and blockchain analysis could not tell who sent any given transaction, a process commonly referred to as mixing. The feds charged the Russian-Swedish dual citizen with unlicensed money transmission and money laundering. An affidavit unsealed alongside the executed arrest warrant detailed how law enforcement officials gathered information to indict Sterlingov.    Why it matters    The affidavit, filed by IRS-CI Agent Devon Beckett, details how his agency tied Sterlingov to Bitcoin Fog, but the information he cites stems from years-old data the U.S. government apparently has about users on the now-defunct BTC-e, Mt. Gox and Liberty Reserve platforms. No, this was not primarily achieved by blockchain analysis. Instead, it appears that federal agents compared email addresses on the centralized platforms to identify Sterlingov before securing an indictment.      Not only does this action reinforce the idea that crypto exchange users give up much of their privacy when signing up, but it emphasizes the feds might hold onto that data for years.    Breaking it down    Bitcoin Fog launched in 2011 and was allegedly a money launderer for various darknet platforms taken down by federal officials over the years, including Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, AlphaBay, Agora and Evolution Market.      A Department of Justice press release even called Bitcoin Fog the “longest-running bitcoin money-laundering service on the darknet.""      Interestingly, the affidavit initially seems to give the impression blockchain analysis was a part of the investigation into the site’s operator.      “While the identity of a Bitcoin address owner is generally anonymous (unless the owner opts to make the information publicly available), law enforcement can often identify the owner of a particular Bitcoin address by analyzing the blockchain,” Beckett wrote.      The blockchain analysis seems to have been used only to confirm Bitcoin Fog’s volume over the past 10 years (1.2 million BTC), and to prove that it was mixing the bitcoin sent through it (more on that later). The rest of the investigation – meaning the part that actually tied Sterlingov to the site he allegedly ran – may have just depended on user databases connected to Mt. Gox, Liberty Reserve, BTC-e and Google.      Taylor Monahan, the founder and CEO of Ethereum wallet manager MyCrypto, tweeted, “As far as I can tell, the tracing of on-chain BTC transactions played ~zero part in tracking down/confirming Bitcoin Fog's alleged operator's” identity.      The IRS sent a subpoena to Google, but it’s a lot less clear where it got the email address and wallet information for the other platforms.      The affidavit says: “Analysis of bitcoin transactions, financial records, Internet service provider records, e-mail records and additional investigative information, identifies ROMAN STERLINGOV as the principal operator of BITCOIN FOG.”      It cites bitcoin sent from a Mt. Gox account (opened in Sterlingov’s name) to a second Mt. Gox account. The bitcoin went through a few other exchanges before eventually landing at a Liberty Reserve account, which was then used to pay for the bitcoinfog.com domain.      Monahan questions where this information was recorded.      Under the Privacy Act of 1974 (h/t Andrew Hinkes), a federal agency cannot provide records to another agency without the permission of any individual mentioned in those records. (It’s unclear whether this happened here.)      According to a Department of Justice webpage, there are a few possible exceptions, though none appear to apply to this case at first glance.      It may have taken the U.S. 10 years to arrest Sterlingov just because federal agents needed to verify information stored on BTC-e before affirmatively tying him to Bitcoin Fog, Monahan said.      The other detail that stood out to me concerns the whole bitcoin mixing aspect. U.S. law enforcement officials have publicly stated their opposition to mixing services before, with one last year calling their use “a crime.” And while it seems like it's too early to be reading tea leaves, I wonder if we’ll see more prosecutions against the operators of mixing services in the future.      Beckett wrote that an undercover IRS agent successfully sent some small portion of bitcoin from one wallet to another, but “investigators were unable to directly trace any direct link between” the two wallets. This is how the IRS agent proved the mixing service was being used to obfuscate transfers, as well as verify that the platform was not conducting any know-your-customer checks.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    The Securities and Exchange Commission has appointed Wharton School Professor Jessica Wachter as its chief economist and the director of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. Professor Wachter has also taught a course on crypto (h/t Andrew Hinkes).      We’re still waiting to see who U.S. President Joseph Biden will nominate to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Consumer Finance Protection Bureau Director-Nominee Rohit Chopra is also still waiting for his confirmation vote.

42434329,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPBV9h,1620127928,"Amid New Price Highs, Ether Flips Bitcoin on Options Volume","Ether's (ETH) record price rally has triggered a flurry of activity in the options market, driving the cryptocurrency to surpass bitcoin (BTC) in terms of trading volumes for the first time.      The ""flippening,"" along with ether's strong price performance in recent weeks, is a further sign of market focus temporarily shifting away from bitcoin, the top crypto asset by market value.      On Monday, four larger exchanges offering ETH options – Deribit, OKEx, Huobi, and bit.com – registered a combined trading volume high of $1.32 billion, surpassing bitcoin's tally for the first time on record. Bitcoin's options market traded contracts worth $879 million on the same day, according to data source Skew.      Ether's options volume soared as prices for the native token of the Ethereum blockchain rose toward a new lifetime high above $3,400 reached Tuesday. While ether has rallied by over 60% in the past four weeks, bitcoin has dropped by 3%, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Options are derivatives contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to purchase, and the put represents the right to sell.      Ether options volume has picked up materially since mid-April, with dominant exchange Deribit contributing over 80% of the total activity.      Ether options open interest, or the number of contracts traded but not settled with offsetting positions, has risen sharply to new record highs above $5 billion, per Skew. Meanwhile, open interest in bitcoin's options market has been trending lower in recent weeks, as seen below.      A similar divergence is seen in the activity in futures tied to the two top cryptocurrencies.      The data represents a shift in investor focus from bitcoin to ether, with Ethereum seeing solid organic growth this year, as recently tweeted by DTC Capital's Spencer Noon.      A report published by digital-asset manager CoinShares on April 26 showed that ether funds and investment products saw an inflow of $34 million in the third week of April, while bitcoin funds lost $21 million.      ""New investor money has been flowing into digital assets since the 3rd quarter of last year, but the investor goals are changing,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, noted in a market recap published on Monday. ""And in the last few months, the investor interest has narrowed even further to 'can I specifically diversify away from Bitcoin into Ethereum and other digital assets?'""      Analysts foresee a continued bull run in ether, with some betting on a rally to $10,000. Therefore, more traders and investors could join ether's derivatives market in a bid to hedge their spot market exposure, or to take plain bullish or bearish bets.      At press time, ether's options market is decisively bullish on the cryptocurrency with one, three and six-month put-call skews trading well below zero – a sign of calls (bullish bets) drawing higher than demand than puts.

According to a report by the Bangkok Post on Monday, citing an industry executive, fresh exchange users will have to follow new know-your-customer (KYC) measures established by the country's Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) from the autumn.      The introduction of a ""dip-chip"" machine, set to come into effect in September, will require new customers to scan the chip embedded in their government-issued ID cards before they can open a crypto account, said Poramin Insom, co-founder and director of Satang Corp., a cryptocurrency trading platform..      Users are currently able to verify their identities by submitting relevant documents online, but the process is reportedly sometimes slow and inefficient as the exchanges independently verify that all IDs comply with relevant KYC regulations.      The machines are expected to reduce disputes, increase transparency and speed applications, and are increasingly used in the local gold trading sector, per the report.      ""Most digital asset exchanges are still busy preparing their systems to accommodate the growing number of clients as new account applications continue to flow in,"" said Poramin.      There are over 697,000 cryptocurrency accounts in Thailand, an increase of 160,000 from the end of last year, according to the report. Poramin warned that the ID-check machines could curb this growth by making the sign-up process more ""complicated.""      A forum is expected to be held at a later date by the self-regulated Thailand Digital Asset Operators Trade Association in order to facilitate discussion between the country's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the AMLO and affected parties.

The Shiba Inu dog-branded cryptocurrency rose to $0.577 during the European trading hours, topping the previous record price of $0.47 registered on April 16, according to CoinDesk data. Year to date DOGE is up 11,000%.      The latest leg higher comes a day after multi-asset brokerage platform eToro announced support for the cryptocurrency, citing strong client demand. The new listing opens dogecoin to some 20 million users spread across the globe. Then Tuesday morning Gemini announced it too will support the meme-based crypto, adding fuel to DOGE's upward trajectory.      Additional buying pressure may have stemmed from pro baseball team Oakland Athletics' decision to sell tickets for dogecoin. In an announcement on Monday, the Major League baseball team said it was selling two-seat pods for 100 DOGE ($48.80 at the time of writing) for its three-match series against the Toronto Blue Jays.

In an online survey of 15,569 people in 18 countries, 40% said they plan to use crypto in the next year, the payments giant said Tuesday.      Among millennials, interest is even higher: 67% said they were more open to using the technology than they were a year ago, 77% said they were interested in learning more about it and 75% said they would use crypto if they understood it better.      The Harris Poll and Mastercard’s research team conducted the survey from Feb. 26 to March 10, polling consumers in four regions: North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific. There were at least 500 respondents in five of the 18 countries and at least 1,000 in the other 13. Mastercard’s press release did not explain why Europe was not included in the survey (which also asked about biometric, contactless and QR code payments).      Neither did it directly mention longstanding impediments to mass adoption, such as the minute-to-minute volatility of exchange rates between crypto and fiat currencies; the disincentive to spend bitcoin, the largest and best-known crypto, when it is expected to rise in value; or U.S. tax law that requires Americans to report and pay taxes on even minuscule purchases made with crypto.      “Work is still required to ensure consumer choice, protection and ... regulatory compliance,” Mastercard said. Bitcoin was the only digital currency it mentioned by name.    Read more: Mastercard Will Let Merchants Accept Payments in Crypto This Year    The company's interest in the sector is more than academic. As CoinDesk was first to report in February, the company plans to give merchants the option to receive payments in cryptocurrency this year. More recently, the Gemini crypto exchange said its upcoming credit card will carry Mastercard’s interlocking-circles brand. Perhaps hedging its bets, the 55-year-old Mastercard is looking at ways to build applications on top of future central bank digital currencies.      Rival card network Visa is in the game now as well; among other initiatives, it’s working with USDC, the U.S. dollar-backed Ethereum token created by startup Circle. PayPal, meanwhile, is letting customers buy, sell and spend crypto on its platform (but not to withdraw or deposit it) and making big acquisitions in the field.
