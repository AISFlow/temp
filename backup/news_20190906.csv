42430924,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyj9h,1567792824,Ethereum to Test Upcoming Istanbul Hard Fork in Early October,"The testnet launch of ethereum's Istanbul system-wide upgrade has been set.  “For anyone listening in who doesn't know how this works, we pick a block number that we estimate to be around the 2nd of October,"" Ethereum Foundation community manager Hudson Jameson said Friday on an ethereum core developer call. ""However, that might be one or two days behind or forward from that date based on how fast blocks are produced between now and then.""  Originally targeted for Sept. 4, the testnet activation was pushed back to Oct. 2 due to the large volume of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that were submitted for review.  Of the roughly 30 EIPs that were deliberated on by developers, only six have been accepted for inclusion in Istanbul with eight other EIPs tentatively planned for a proceeding system-wide upgrade, or hard fork, newly dubbed ""Berlin.""  With the Istanbul testnet upgrade now a month later than planned, mainnet activation will similarly be postponed till November, after the close of Devcon, ethereum's premier developer conference.  A specific date and block height for mainnet activation was deliberately left unspecified given cautious sentiment from ethereum developers about prematurely committing to new target dates for Istanbul.  ""One of the lessons learned in the [previous] Byzantium fork last year is that we shouldn't try to set the testnet and mainnet fork at the same time,"" E.G. Galano, the chief infrastructure engineer of ethereum startup Infura, said during the meeting. ""Let's start with setting the testnet fork and see how that goes and find a period of stability before revisiting when to set the mainnet fork.""  Ongoing security audits  Outside of lingering debate over the wording of certain EIPs approved for Istanbul, developers also discussed Friday the results of an initial security audit done by security consulting firm Least Authority over the proposed ProgPoW mining algorithm change.  Having been discussed by developers for close to a year now, ProgPoW is an EIP intended to block specialized mining hardware called ASICs from participating on the network and competing in an estimated $655 million annual market for ethereum's mining rewards.  As summarized by Least Authority CEO Liz Steininger during the meeting:  ""On a high-level, [ProgPoW] reaches its design goals. It's reasonable towards its intended economic effect. No major issues there. That said, we did find one [potential] attack ... and had some recommendations about things that could be done to have better assurances of ProgPoW working as intended in the future.""  There is still another audit on ProgPoW pending completion, as noted by Jameson during today's meeting.  ""[Bob Rao] is doing a very extensive hardware audit,"" Jameson said. ""Bob's audit should be coming out very soon. It's in final stages [and] is going to answer a lot more of the questions and speculations around ProgPoW.""  Barring any significant security concerns raised by these two auditors, developers are expected to proceed with the activation of the mining code change in the following hard fork, Berlin.

The company said it will use the funds for R&D and to add new services to its site.  DappRadar tracks some 2,500 dapp projects on multiple blockchains such as ethereum, EOS, tron, and the loom network.  DappRadar’s Ian Kane said the company attracted high profile investments due to its listing criteria and user count.  “Unlike some of our competitors, we have a public, robust attitude in terms of filtering out what we consider ‘fake’ or ‘manipulated’ traffic, notably traffic generated by bots,” Kane said. Dapp data is difficult to track due to the range of protocol styles and blockchain networks they typically operate on.  Kane said DappRadar has had monthly traffic north of half-a-million users, although traffic can be quite volatile. The launching of new products such as CryptoKitties coincides with most traffic spikes, Kane said.  Speaking on the seed round, Blockchain.com Ventures Managing Partner Samuel Harrison echoed Kane, noting DappRadar’s integrity-based business model.  “DappRadar is playing a vital role in bringing trust, transparency and discovery to the fragmented world of dapps.

The team “finished 4th in UEFA’s Club Coefficients rankings for 2019” according to a release and will join other football teams like Juventus and West Ham United on the Socios.com fan platform.  “The Atlético de Madrid Fan Token will be priced at €2 and will be available exclusively through Socios.com in Autumn 2019 for the 19/20 season. Fan Tokens can also be hunted for free through the app’s augmented-reality geo-location feature Token Hunt,” wrote the creators. “Atlético de Madrid Fan Token holders will enjoy exclusive rights on the platform, including access to unique and exclusive experiences, promotions, draws and polls.”  Fans will also be able to get merchandise using the tokens and exchange tokens with each other using the app.  Atlético de Madrid is just one of the many football clubs that took to the blockchain in the past two years. Top French league team, Paris Saint-Germain, issued its own cryptocurrency on Socios in 2018 and the platform plans on adding many more clubs to its roster.  “Our ambition is to build the world’s biggest global football community and marketplace for football fans alongside demonstrating that blockchain and cryptocurrency is the trusted technology of the mainstream,” said Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO and founder last year.  The platform avoids many of the complexities of cryptocurrency trading and instead acts as more of a fan support system that happens to use fan coins. Users can earn more tokens by taking polls on the app and gain prestige as they rise in the rankings of superfans.

42430931,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyjHh,1567774855,Leadership Shakeup at Wasabi Wallet as Bitcoin Business Surges,"One of bitcoin’s most experimental startups has grown dramatically over the past year, highlighting both the opportunities and pitfalls of open source development.  Now Adam Ficsor, co-founder of zkSNACKs – the firm behind the privacy-centric Wasabi Wallet – is stepping down from his role as CTO to focus on research as the company matures.  “I was just reviewing other people’s code and managing people, and that’s not what I’m good at. I’m good at coding and researching privacy,” Ficsor said. “It’s getting to the point of being a serious business and we have to be more conservative.”  Wasabi Wallet launched in August 2018, then garnered more than three-dozen open source contributors via GitHub. As a bootstrapped startup that strove to embody the bitcoin’s decentralized ethos, managing contributions is central to Wasabi’s development. There are now five zkSNACKs developers reviewing external submissions as part of the effort to reduce Ficsor’s cornerstone role in the project.  The move to a new CTO follows a bitter feud with Wasabi’s rival, Samourai Wallet, which published critiques of Wasabi’s trademark CoinJoin feature in August. This mixing feature collects pending bitcoin transactions then sends them out in a mixed bunch so it’s harder to identify the source of each transaction.  After the backlash sparked by Samourai’s critique, Dávid Molnár, incoming zkSNACKs CTO, told CoinDesk that Wasabi users clearly require more documentation to avoid confusion. Plus, he added, code should be written in a standardized way that is easier for people to read, regardless of its functionality.  “Adam and me have the same coding style. But when we started the Contribution Game, we also had to write documents about how to code [for Wasabi],” Molnár said, referring to a summer campaign that attracted 15 developers to review code and offer potential solutions. “I plan to continue this procedure.”  Today, the zkSNACKs staff includes nearly 20 employees, including several developers who went from being volunteer contributors to official contractors paid with bitcoin earnings from the CoinJoin feature. According to Ficsor, wallet transaction fees earned the startup 8 bitcoin in May, 10 bitcoin in June, and 14 bitcoin in July 2019, with the latter alone being worth roughly $149,000 on Sept. 4.  “The first six months were pretty painful, we had to pay everyone from our pockets and we weren’t sure we’d survive. But now we have considerable income and we don’t need to look for investors anymore,” Ficsor said, adding that the newest version of Wasabi, released in July 2019, has 13,000 downloads so far.  Industry impact  Mixing features from both Wasabi and Samourai have become increasingly popular in 2019.  Samourai’s comparable “Whirlpool” feature has seen 3,201 transactions since April 2019, according to data from the bitcoin blockchain. That’s slightly more than Wasabi’s 2,810 CoinJoins in the same time frame. (Wasabi has facilitated a total of 5,286 CoinJoin transactions since launching in August 2018. However, the latter often involves more participants per transaction.)  Still, bitcoin consultant Udi Wertheimer argued that Wasabi has set the tone for privacy features across the industry. The analytics firm Chainalysis reportedly estimated during a webinar that Wasabi alone was responsible for mixing $90 million worth of bitcoin in August 2019.  In part, Wertheimer told CoinDesk this uptick came because Wasabi offered “the first CoinJoin implementation that's easy enough to use that a motivated non-technical user could make use of it.""  These CoinJoin transactions can combine a variety of privacy-focused techniques, depending on the user’s sophistication, which is why users are willing to pay fees of up to 5 percent per transaction.  “I think the business model for Wasabi is very unique, because they manage to generate revenue while minimizing trust,” Wertheimer said. “The Wasabi server is generating real value and has real network effect, that's why users are willing to pay for it. It's also where the rivalry comes from, as upstarts have to try compete with that advantage.”  While Molnár said he is focusing on fostering robust contributions and stabilizing the product, which is currently slow and glitchy, Ficsor will work on integrating bitcoin node features directly into the wallet.  “We want to bring Bitcoin Core into Wasabi [desktop] in a way that you just click a checkbox and have a full node operating from then on,” Fiscor said. “Also, as the blockchain fees go up, this way of mixing with Wasabi is not going to be economical. … We have to figure out what is the most optimal algorithm for mixing with Wasabi.”  Image: zkSNACKs founders (left to right) Lucas Ontivero, Balint Harmat, Gergely Hajdu and Adam Ficsor.

42430940,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyjXh,1567771231,Trump's Trade War May Be Driving Chinese Investors to Bitcoin,"As the Chinese yuan falls in value due to factors like the ongoing trade war with the U.S., there are signs that locals are increasingly moving funds into bitcoin.  According to a Bloomberg analysis of prices over 30 days, the negative correlation between the yuan and bitcoin has fallen to a record low in the last seven days.  While previously the Chinese government has sought to keep the value of its national currency above 7 CNY to the dollar, last month the yuan was allowed to slide below that level, dropping to its lowest for 10 years. The move was reportedly in response to U.S. President Donald Trumps threats in early August to impose a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports.  That the drop in yuan value is causing a flight by Chinese investors is backed up by exchange data. Bloomberg spoke to Dr. Garrick Hileman, research director at Blockchain and CoinDesk contributor, who said that bitcoin prices on exchanges such as Huobi that cater more to Chinese traders are trading at a premium.  The inverse correlation between bitcoin and the yuan also notched up in April and May ""as the tensions ratcheted up with the deterioration on U.S.-China trade relations,” Hileman said.  The report comes as new details emerge on China's own national digital currency. The recently appointed chief of the digital currency division of the People's Bank of China has said the upcoming digital yuan will have features not offered by Facebook Libra.

42382620,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOtP,1567767798,Bitcoin Price May Break Longest Weekly Losing Run Since November,"View  Bitcoin is likely to end the current week (Sunday, UTC) on a positive note, having registered losses in the previous three weeks. Prices are currently up 10 percent on a month-to-date basis.  The weekly gain could be much bigger if prices invalidate a bearish lower highs pattern with a UTC close above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high).  BTC may end the week on a flat note or with losses below $9,767 (Monday's opening price) if the recent trading range of $10,400-$10,800 is breached to the downside.  A range breakdown would put the bears in a commanding position and open the doors for a drop below $10,000.      Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing gains on a week-to-date basis and appears on track to end its longest seven-day losing run in nine-months.  The top cryptocurrency is currently trading at $10,750, representing 10 percent gains on the weekly (Monday) opening price of $9,767, according to Bitstamp data.  The price rise is preceded by three consecutive weekly losses – the cryptocurrency fell 3.67 percent in the seven days to Aug. 31, having dropped 10.49 percent and 1.77% in the preceding two weeks.  BTC last chalked out losses for three straight weeks in November 2018. Back then, the cryptocurrency had dropped 1, 12.56 and 29.15 percent in the first, second and the third week, respectively.  Compared to that, the latest losing streak looks less damaging and is a part of a multi-week consolidation, representing bullish exhaustion following a stellar rally from $4,000 to $13,800 in the second quarter.  If prices print a UTC close above $9,767 on Sunday, the three-week downward trend will end. Meanwhile, BTC will chart its first four-week losing run in three years if prices close below $9,767 on Sunday.  That said, BTC is likely to eke out weekly gains, according to historical data.  As seen above, BTC charted multiple three-week losing runs throughout the 2018 bear market.  However, despite the strong bearish mood, the cryptocurrency repeatedly managed to stall the sell-off by scoring gains in the fourth week, although more often than not, the relief was short-lived.  As of now, BTC is in a bull market. Further, trading volumes dropped over the last three weeks, a sign of a bear trap.  That said, the probability of BTC closing the week with losses or on a flat note will rise if the recent trading range of $400 is breached to the downside in the next 24 hours or so.  4-hour and daily chart  BTC has been largely restricted to a $10,400 to $10,800 trading range (above left) since Sept. 3. Essentially, the rally from Aug. 29's low of $9,360 has run out of steam.  A high-volume break above $10,800 would imply a resumption of the rally from $9,360 and could yield a break above $11,000.  A more reliable indicator of bullish revival would be a UTC close above the lower high of $10,956 created on Aug. 20 (above right), as discussed yesterday.  A bullish close above $10,956, if confirmed, would open the doors to $12,000. The weekly gain could be much higher than the current 10 percent if prices close above $10,956 today or tomorrow.  The weekly gain, however, would be meager or the cryptocurrency may close the week in the red if prices drop below $10,400 with high volumes.  A high-volume range breakdown would mean victory for the sellers in the ongoing tug of war with the bulls. As a result, prices could fall back into four figures – more so, as key weekly indicators like the moving average convergence divergence histogram have turned bearish for the first time since February.

42382603,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOY1,1567762239,New Head of China's Digital Currency Says It Beats Facebook Libra on Tech Features,"The Chinese central bank has a new digital currency chief who says its upcoming digital yuan has features not offered by Facebook Libra.  Changchun Mu – previously deputy director of the payments and settlement division at the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) – recently stepped into the lead role at the Digital Currency Research Institute, reports Shanghai Securities News.  According to the state-run news source, Mu recently published details on PBoC's digital currency – apparently being carried out in a secret office away from the bank's Beijing headquarters – describing it as a digital currency and electronic payment tool with ""value characteristics.""  ""Its functional attributes are exactly the same as paper money, but it is just a digital form,"" Mu said.  Perhaps most notably, he set out some of the digital currency's technical aspects, and compared it with Facebook's Libra.  PBoC's digital yuan will be able to be transferred between users without an account and without a mobile or internet network, the report cites Mu as saying. Providing a user's mobile phone has a wallet, the digital currency can be transferred to another person by placing the two phones in physical contact. Presumably, this feature is enabled by near-field communication (NFC).  ""Even Libra can't do this,"" Mu said.  PBoC's digital currency also doesn't need a bank account to be used, and is ""free from the control of the traditional bank account system,"" Shanghai Securities News cites Mu as saying. He further suggested it allows users to preserve their privacy when using the system.  However, the digital currency will be delivered via commercial banks like fiat currency. The banks must open accounts with the PBoC and buy the token at 100 percent value. After that, users may open digital wallets for the digital currency through the banks or commercial organizations.  According to the report, Mu added that the main reason for developing the digital currency is ""planning ahead"" to protect monetary sovereignty and China's legal currency. That may be a hint that the advent of Facebook's Libra is behind the sudden rush of development at the central bank.  Former People’s Bank of China (PBoC) governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in July that “Libra has introduced a concept that will impact the traditional cross-border business and payment system.”  As such, China should “make good preparations and make the Chinese yuan a stronger currency,” Zhou said.

42382608,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOaX,1567756802,The State of Security Token Regulations in Asia,"This essay is presented as a part of No Closing Bell, a series leading up to Invest: Asia 2019 focused on how the Asian crypto markets are interacting with and impacting global investors. To keep the conversation going in person, register for Invest: Asia 2019 coming up in Singapore on Sept. 11-12.      Since the cryptocurrency boom and initial coin offering craze of 2017, many countries in Asia have taken steps to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and security tokens.  In this article, we focus on the three countries that have the clearest regulations in place regarding digital assets, though there is still more work to be done.  Thailand  Within Asia, Thailand has by far the most well-defined legislations in place to govern security token offerings and exchanges.  In May 2018, the Thai government has published its Digital Asset Decreehttps://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/tax/international-tax/alert--thailand-enacts-emergency-decrees-on-digital-assets that establishes the necessary requirements for a business to offer or provide operations for digital assets. The decree covers both cryptocurrencies as well as digital tokens and is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand (SEC Thailand). The decree clearly segments between primary issuance activities (ie fundraising), applicable to token offerers and issuers, and secondary market activities (ie trading), applicable to token exchange and trade-related intermediaries.  With the decree enacted, Thailand has also established three types of licenses:  Digital Asset Exchange License;  Digital Asset Broker License; and  Digital Asset Dealer License.  These licenses lay out the specific activities that businesses can participate in. The exchange license is applicable to a centre or network established for the purposes of trading or exchanging of digital assets. The broker license is applicable to any person who provides services as a broker or an agent with respect to the trading or exchange of digital assets. The dealer license is applicable to any person who provides services with respect to the trading or exchange of digital assets for its own account outside the digital asset exchange.  Separately, the Digital Asset Decree has restricted token issuances to be done only through approved ICO portals. Thailand has also specifically set out a list of approved cryptocurrencies that may be accepted as investment capital for ICOs, and to be paired with other assets on digital asset exchanges: BTC, ETH, XRP, XLM.  Presently, Thailand’s Ministry of Finance, under the recommendation of SEC Thailand, has approved five, three brokers Digital Asset Brokers, one dealer, and three ICO portals.  There is more work to be done: Thailand hasn’t established clear guidelines regarding custody requirements for digital asset and cryptocurrency businesses. Today it is unclear as to whether existing standards applicable to securities should be applicable to digital assets, or if new guidelines and regulations will be established in future.  Singapore  Singapore’s de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, issued a set of guidelines last November entitled “A Guide to Digital Token Offerings”.  This clarifies what type of digital assets fall under Singapore’s Securities and Futures Act (SFA). If the digital tokens constitute capital markets products as defined in the SFA (ie securities, derivatives contracts etc), they are regulated under the SFA. In these cases, the existing relevant licenses apply, based on the activities performed by the businesses: whether as a token issuer, exchange platform, advisor or otherwise.  For example, a security token issuance platform must operate under a Capital Markets Services (CMS) license for the purpose of dealing in capital markets products (which includes securities). A digital asset exchange that facilitates trading in security tokens must operate under a license as either an approved exchange or a recognized market operator.  Unlike Thailand, the SFA in Singapore only applies to digital assets that fall under the definition of capital markets products. Other digital tokens may be classified as payment tokens (eg bitcoin, ether), and fall under the Payment Services Act (PSA), which is estimated to take effect in late 2019 and has a separate set of licenses.  With both the SFA and PSA active, we can expect that digital asset companies will have a clearer set of regulations to comply with, in line with securities and payment regulations. However, just like Thailand, custody requirements are still unclear at the moment. Given that the existing CMS license covers custodial services for securities, we expect that digital asset custodians will need to operate under a CMS license.  Singapore’s government and related entities have further shown commitment and enthusiasm for developing the industry. In particular, last November, MAS granted a recognized market operator (RMO) license to 1exchange, Singapore’s first private securities exchange that facilitates digital token trading. Singapore’s flagship stock exchange SGX is an investor in 1exchange.  The MAS is currently working with fintech businesses in a regulatory sandbox environment to figure out the missing pieces, and we expect to see updates within the next six months. It is clear that the Singapore government is supportive of the growth of the digital assets industry, and it continues to build the ecosystem.  Hong Kong  Serving as one of Asia’s key financial hubs, Hong Kong is also establishing its regulations for the crypto scene. In September 2017, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (HK SFC) released a statement on ICOs, then lastNovember, it published a statement and a circular on the regulatory framework for virtual asset portfolio managers, fund distributors, and trading platform operators. The HK SFC uses the terminology of “virtual asset”, which it defines as a digital representation of value, which is also known as ""cryptocurrency"", ""crypto-asset"" or ""digital token"".  The new publications provide more regulatory clarity with respect to investment and management of funds investing in digital assets.  In March 2019, the HK SFC released a “Statement on Security Token Offerings”, reminding operators that where security tokens are securities, unless an applicable exemption applies, any person who markets and distributes security tokens (whether in Hong Kong or targeting Hong Kong investors) is required to be licensed or registered for Type 1 regulated activity (dealing in securities) under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO).  However, Hong Kong is still conceptualizing how it should regulate digital asset exchange platforms. Through its November 2018 publications, SFC called for exchange operators to come forward and join its regulatory sandbox in order to determine the type of license to be granted to exchange operators. Exchange operators may need to be regulated by the SFC and require SFO Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 7 (provision of automated trading services) licenses.  Per current regulations, custodial activities are not regulated by the SFC but entities acting as custodians have to be set up as a Public Trust Company and apply for the Trust or Company Service Provider (TCSP) license, issued by the Hong Kong Companies Registry.  It still remains unclear as to whether there will be separate guidelines for digital asset custodians, or if today’s regulations, applicable to traditional custodians, shall be applicable to digital asset custodians as well.  Conclusion  Other governments in the Asia-Pacific region have also taken various steps towards defining a clearer scope of regulatory requirements for digital assets.  For example, in the Philippines, the government has set up the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority which oversees a special economic zone that focuses on fintech and crypto-related businesses. In tandem, in February, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines issued draft regulations around digital asset and token offerings, and proposed rules for exchanges. Malaysia has regulations similar to those in Singapore, and is also working on adapting these to cover digital assets.  Plenty of ambiguities exist within today’s legal frameworks, often because they were designed for a non-digital world. Yet technology marches on.  Today, larger and larger organizations from finance and technology sectors are building cryptocurrency and blockchain platforms. Such moves have increased the urgency for governments to understand and regulate digital assets, in order to keep up with the ever-changing realities of business.  Although it remains to be seen how the STO and crypto scene will ultimately shape up globally, we expect to see more regulatory developments soon. One thing we can be certain of is that the bulk of the action and innovation will be driven from Asia.
