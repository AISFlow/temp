When the network gets congested due to a high number of transactions, the transaction fees go up, indicating a high volume of traffic on the network. Transaction traffic usually is high around bull markets when the price of the digital asset is up. Usually leading to a sell-off as investors try to take profits. Related Reading | Bitcoin Suffers As Mid Caps Cryptos Establish Market Dominance With Wide Margin One thing, this recent bull market has been anything but usual. So many things that are normal around bull markets have not happened with this bull market. An example is the declining reserves on exchanges. Bitcoin going up would often trigger an increase in the exchange reserves with the bull market, which happens because investors are trying to sell off their coins. This bull market, however, has shown the opposite. Exchange reserves have plummeted, and along with it, bitcoin transaction fees are at one-year lows, indicating that investors are carrying out fewer transactions on the blockchain. Transaction Fees Plummet The current climate for bitcoin transaction fees has been at levels not seen since last year.

However, one topic that continues to dominate the headlines is blockchain. Blockchain technology has been praised for its ability to streamline operations and reduce costs while also providing transparency and security within a business environment. One often overlooked aspect of this groundbreaking technology is how it can help shape the future of our planet as well. In fact, there are many ways in which blockchain technology can be used to solve environmental issues on a global scale. How Blockchain Can Help Save The Environment The environment is facing a number of serious challenges. From air pollution to climate change, the planet is being affected in many negative ways that are having an impact on our health and the future of our planet. All around the world, people are becoming more aware of these issues. More and more people are working to find solutions for each of these problems, but there is one area where blockchain technology can make a huge difference: the environment. For one, blockchain can be used to donate to environmental charities in new and creative ways. For instance, Next Earth is a virtual replica of Earth on BSC, in which users can buy NFT land tiles from the Statue of Liberty to the White House to farmland. 10% of the value of those purchases goes to environmental causes.

Coinbase Inc. appears as “not an NFA member,” but Coinbase Financial Markets Inc. is “a pending NFA member.”  According to the NFA website, Coinbase Financial Markets’ CEO is Joseph Nikolson, who joined the exchange in 2018.  He has been a registered broker with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for over 20 years, according to FINRA’s BrokerCheck.  The NFA website makes note of Coinbase’s past run-ins with federal regulators. While Coinbase Financial Markets appears to be a relatively recent entity, Coinbase itself settled charges with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) earlier this year on allegations it “self-traded” digital assets and allowed a former employee to wash trade litecoin.  It’s unclear whether Coinbase has also applied for any of the necessary licenses with the CFTC, the federal regulator that oversees futures products in the U.S. The company will need different licenses from the regulator to list futures.  “We anticipate that this may be a long process to approval but are looking forward to working with the NFA as they review our application. Coinbase is excited to be taking this next step to broaden our crypto offering and further growing the crypto-economy,” an exchange spokesperson told CoinDesk.

The cryptocurrency was up about 3% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 5% gain in ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, over the same period.  “[Blockchain] metrics continue to show whale (large bitcoin buyers) accumulation,” Marcus Sotiriou, a trader at U.K.- based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “A four-hour bullish divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) indicator has been confirmed, indicating short-term continuation to the upside,” Sotiriou wrote. The RSI is now overbought on the four-hour chart, suggesting that buyers could struggle ahead of the $50,000 resistance level.

The chart below shows $50,000 is the strike with largest options open interest, according to Skew.  Bitcoin’s golden cross  Bitcoin has formed a “golden cross” on its daily price chart, a rare but closely tracked pattern that generally occurs when an asset is on the upswing.  The golden cross is a momentum indicator, defined as the point at which the 50-day moving price average crosses above the 200-day moving average. It’s a sign that the short-term price trend is rising faster than the long-term trend, reports CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma.  The appearance of the golden cross marks a dramatic comeback for bitcoin since a “death cross” appeared in the price chart three months ago.  It’s worth noting that the indicator’s predictive power for future trends is limited.  James Butterfill, an investment strategist at CoinShares, warned in a LinkedIn post that traders should be “cautious” when pundits refer to the golden cross pattern as a bullish technical signal. The indicator “hasn’t been a consistent predictor of positive returns,” he said.  Stablecoins ready to push bitcoin higher?  Bitcoin’s stablecoin supply ratio (SSR), which measures the cryptocurrency’s supply relative to the total supply of stablecoins denoted in BTC, is starting to rise. Some analysts believe a higher SSR is positive for bitcoin’s price.  “SSR just tested support and is slowly climbing up,” CryptoQuant wrote in a blog post. A low SSR means stablecoins have more buying power against BTC and could therefore be used to acquire more bitcoin or altcoins, according to CryptoQuant.

Altcoin roundup  Solana mainnet is back online after day-long outage: Ethereum competitor Solana Engineers succeed in restoring service across Solana’s network of node-runners after the system was in the dark for almost 20 hours, reported CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson. In response to the outage, Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko tweeted, “better now than when it’s a billion users.” SOL, the native token of the network, quickly popped over 3% upon news of the fix, reclaiming some lost ground but still short of yesterday’s highs. SOL had been down 13% to the mid-$140 range at Tuesday’s lowest point. Solana has been one of the hottest altcoins this year, returning over 7,000%.  Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is named to Time’s ‘Most Influential’ list: The storied magazine gave a nod to the crypto wunderkind, reported CoinDesk’s Zack Seward. The inclusion in Time appears to be part of a low-key publicity tour for Buterin, who is also involved in a new documentary about Ethereum and is voicing a taxidermied cat in an animation project backed by actress Mila Kunis and actor Ashton Kutcher. “What makes Vitalik so special, though, is that he is a builder’s builder,” Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian wrote for Time. “No one person could’ve possibly come up with all of the uses for Ethereum, but it did take one person’s idea to get it started.”  NFT marketplace OpenSea faces insider trading allegations: OpenSea, a marketplace for non-fungible tokens, issued a statement Wednesday saying it had uncovered evidence of insider trading by one of its employees, reported CoinDesk’s Will Gottsegen. “Yesterday we learned that one of our employees purchased items that they knew were set to display on our front page before they appeared there publicly,” the statement reads. The company says it’s implementing new policies that prohibit that kind of behavior.

The statement doesn’t have a byline, but the public relations team for Andreessen Horowitz, a major investor in OpenSea, has been handling company communications around the scandal, which comes less than two months after OpenSea snagged a $1.5 billion valuation in a $100 million funding round.  Allegations of insider trading at OpenSea appeared last night, courtesy of a Twitter account called @ZuwuTV, and quickly went viral.  In a thread, the Twitter user assembled a paper trail of transaction receipts tied to Nate Chastain, OpenSea’s head of product. Chastain, the Twitter account alleged, was investing in NFTs just before OpenSea featured them on the front page of its website, and then cashing out on the consequent price increase.  Chastain didn’t immediately return a request for comment.  Insider trading on NFTs is, of course, not explicitly illegal yet, because there’s so little legal precedent for digital assets on the blockchain, but OpenSea is coming down hard anyway.  The company says it’s implementing new policies that prohibit this kind of behavior.  “For a new, more open internet that empowers creators and collectors, we will need to bake in trust and transparency into all that we do,” reads the statement. “We’re committed to doing the right thing for our users and earning back the trust of the community we serve.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/15/insider-trading-allegations-rock-opensea-nft-marketplace-responds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b6caf63b82336ad70d7100666efc49a0f24ce18-1137x803.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412008,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otbt6E,1631726866,Grayscale’s Vision for Bitcoin ETF at Odds With Those of SEC Chair Gensler,"Grayscale, the world’s largest digital asset manager, says it will continue to seek regulatory approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by actual units of the cryptocurrency, even as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler says he would prefer to approve an ETF backed by bitcoin futures contracts.  Some analysts predict that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), whose shares already trade in public stock markets, has no chance of winning approval anytime soon for its current plan to convert the $30 billion trust into an ETF backed by the cryptocurrency.  The related speculation is that investor demand for GBTC shares could erode if the SEC approves competing proposals for a bitcoin ETF, such as a recent flurry of filings pegged to the futures market. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, of which CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary.)  One possibility is that the so-called GBTC discount could widen if the predictions prove accurate. This discount represents the difference between the per-share value of the bitcoin held by GBTC and the share price as traded in public markets. Generally speaking, the lower the demand, the wider the discount.  The discount to the fund’s net-asset value is currently near 15%, though in May it widened to 20%. For most of last year and into early 2021, the shares traded at a premium to the net asset value. But investor demand for the vehicle waned as the bitcoin market entered a downtrend starting in March, and as bitcoin ETFs were approved in Canada and elsewhere. The SEC has yet to approve any bitcoin ETFs.  “Risks may be enhanced if fees for the new ETFs are half of GBTC’s 2%,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas.  Grayscale is still banking on the possibility that the SEC is open to a spot bitcoin ETF. “Spot” refers to “spot markets,” or in this case the mostly unregulated exchange-based and over-the-counter markets where traders swap bitcoin. That’s contrasted with the bitcoin futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges like the Chicago-based CME.  “We are not sitting back with our feet up,” David LaValle, Grayscale’s head of ETFs, said in an interview. “Gensler’s comments have not changed our business strategy, and we will utilize and leverage an ETF wrapper to bring other products to market such as traditional equity-based ETF.”  As for GBTC, “when we’re able to convert into ETF, that discount will collapse, and we look forward to that opportunity,” LaValle said.  But some analysts say that opportunity might be in the distant future, arguing that a bitcoin futures ETF will be approved by the SEC before a spot ETF.  “Converting funds from structure to structure is hard, requiring significant operational and legal work,” Dave Nadig, director of research at ETFTrends.com wrote in a blogpost. “I actually think that puts GBTC at the back of the line, not the front.”  It’s not so simple  Grayscale’s LaValle noted in the interview that a futures-based bitcoin ETF comes with complexities. With futures trading, there’s an additional layer of financial structuring; futures contracts are considered to be derivatives of the original, underlying assets. An oil futures contract, for example, is not the same as directly trading a barrel of oil.  “A futures-based ETF, BTC or otherwise, is a more complex, expensive cost structure, with operational hurdles that can impact the return stream,” LaValle said.  Meanwhile, other asset managers are trying to get a bitcoin-futures ETF across the finish line.  On Tuesday, the rival digital-asset manager Bitwise submitted an application to the SEC for its Bitcoin Strategy ETF, under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  “The Fund will not invest directly in bitcoin,” the filing said. “The Fund intends to obtain exposure to bitcoin primarily through indirect investments in standardized, cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts traded on commodity exchanges” that are registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  “A spot bitcoin ETF would be a better solution for most investors than a futures-based bitcoin ETF,” Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told CoinDesk in an email. “It would be simpler, lower-cost and easier to understand. But a futures-based bitcoin ETF is better than no ETF at all.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/15/grayscales-vision-for-bitcoin-etf-at-odds-with-those-of-sec-chair-gensler,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29c330596d160018427a9fdbd62d1508a123b36a-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The golden cross is a momentum indicator, defined as the point at which the 50-day moving price average crosses above the 200-day moving average. It’s a sign that the short-term price trend is rising faster than the long-term trend.  The appearance of the golden cross marks a dramatic comeback for bitcoin since a “death cross” appeared in the price chart three months ago. At the time, bitcoin was descending from the all-time high near $65,000 reached in February. A few days after the death cross, the price fell to $28,600, close to its 2021 low. The death cross is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average.  The golden cross is generally regarded as a “positive” indicator,” investment research firm Fundstrat wrote Wednesday in a note to subscribers.  It’s worth noting that the indicator’s predictive power for future trends is limited.  James Butterfill, an investment strategist at CoinShares, warned in a LinkedIn post that traders should be “cautious” when pundits refer to the golden cross pattern as a bullish technical signal. The indicator “hasn’t been a consistent predictor of positive returns.”  That said, bitcoin was changing hands at around $9,500 in May 2020, the last time a golden cross appeared.

The honorific comes as Ethereum continues to grow as a major force in the world of finance and beyond. The network’s upgrade to proof-of-stake also looms.  The inclusion in Time amounts to a continuation of a low-key publicity tour for Buterin. The technologist is involved in a new documentary about Ethereum. He’s even voicing a taxidermied cat in a star-studded animation project backed by Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher.  “What makes Vitalik so special, though, is that he is a builder’s builder,” Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian wrote for Time. “No one person could’ve possibly come up with all of the uses for Ethereum, but it did take one person’s idea to get it started.”  A spokesperson for Time said the list is selected by Time’s editors.  “I got an email that asked if I’d like to write up a piece for TIME about Vitalik and I said ‘hell yes I do’ and wrote what was published,” Ohanian, also the founder of venture firm Seven Seven Six, told CoinDesk via email, adding:  “It’s amazing to think how much of my career has been made possible thanks to his work: investments in the ETH presale, CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, Loot, and startups like Coinbase, Axie Infinity, Sorare, Quicknode, Skyweaver, and Rainbow... I’ve never been more excited about the potential of the internet thanks to him.”  Time’s 2021 list also included Dogecoin-lover Elon Musk (he also made the cut in 2018).

42421747,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpK3R,1631723139,The Upside of a Gensler-Led Crackdown,"SEC Chairman Gary Gensler yesterday delivered lengthy testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, covering a variety of topics including the agency’s plans for more structured regulation of cryptocurrency. With many in the industry decrying what has often appeared to be a scattershot and improvised approach to crypto regulation, Gensler told the committee that his SEC staff is hard at work drafting new, clearer rules for the industry.  Gensler made one particularly notable comment, saying that the publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase is offering “dozens of tokens that might be securities” without being properly registered to do so.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk Chief Insights Columnist.  That is understandably frustrating for Coinbase and industry observers more broadly, given that the SEC took a relatively hands-off approach during the 2017 boom in so-called “initial coin offerings” that birthed many of the assets traded on Coinbase. More broadly, Coinbase and others have argued that the SEC has refused to offer sufficient regulatory clarity on crypto.  In historical terms, that hasn’t been entirely negative. To a degree, the past few years have amounted to an unspoken “safe harbor” period in which the SEC and others didn’t pre-emptively shut down ICO projects or other crypto innovations, instead carefully picking the most obviously fraudulent targets for later prosecution. It’s increasingly clear that Gensler’s SEC will break with that approach, as seen with the recent pre-emptive warning to Coinbase about a proposed lending product.  But why, in retrospect, was the SEC so hands-off for so long? An intriguing perspective was floated after Gensler’s testimony by Bennett Tomlin, an independent financial analyst and co-host of the “Crypto Critics Corner” podcast. “I have an intuitive sense that many ICO promoters benefited from the Trump Administration running the SEC,” Tomlin tweeted.  On the one hand, that could apply to any Republican administration, given the party’s ideological bent for less government oversight and more individual responsibility. But there were also worrying elements specific to the Trump administration.  One example is the tie between former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Brock Pierce, a major player in a variety of crypto projects that in retrospect appear increasingly questionable. Bannon and Pierce worked together starting in the mid-2000s, when both were pioneers in the sale of digital assets for video games. Gaming eventually led Pierce into crypto, as it did many others, and he became a co-founder of crypto entity Block.One. Block.One organized and ran what purportedly became the biggest ICO of all time, raising a supposed $4.4 billion for a supposed Ethereum competitor called EOS.  That sale has since been alleged to be substantially fraudulent. Block.One paid a $24 million fine in 2019 for sale of an unregistered security, but at the time that fine was viewed by many as a laughable slap on the wrist given the amount raised. And apparently much more severe misbehavior has not yet been pursued by regulators: Researchers recently alleged that as much as $800 million of the supposed total raised was the result of “recycling” donated ether into supposedly new donations. The report did not specifically claim that Block.One was directly involved, and the company has denied engaging in collusion.  This manipulation of the numbers likely helped bait more real investors into giving money to Block.One. But three years later, EOS has largely failed to live up to either its technical or financial promise, and currently has a market cap of only $4.7 billion, likely representing huge losses or opportunity costs for many EOS backers. Dan Larimer, the technical head of the project who was for a time held up as a Vitalik-like genius, has largely disappeared from the crypto scene. That means an awful lot of early crypto investment has more or less evaporated, instead of helping push the technology or ecosystem forward.  This is not to allege any outright collusion between Trump’s SEC and crypto fundraisers. But it should be kept in mind amid the uproar over what seems likely to become more aggressive regulation under Gensler. While it might uncharitably be viewed as a crackdown, it’s also worth considering that the Trump SEC was to a degree asleep at the wheel, and that the real clarity Gensler is promising could be a net benefit to the industry if it’s done right.

42412003,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otbspG,1631722897,"Digital Euro Isn’t Guaranteed After Experiment, ECB Advisor Says","The upcoming two-year European Central Bank (ECB) investigation into a digital euro is not an assurance that the bank will issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to an ECB official.  Speaking during a panel discussion at Bitkom’s first Digital Euro Summit on Wednesday, Jürgen Schaaf, advisor to the senior management of the Market Infrastructure and Payments business area of the ECB, said that the bank will experiment with a digital euro and use insights from this investigation as input for a decision on whether or not to actually create a CBDC.  “This is still not a decision to introduce or issue a digital euro. After these phases, we will have to assess properly whether the potential benefits outweigh the possible disadvantages and then take a profound decision,” Schaaf said.  Meanwhile, China is forging ahead with its digital yuan: In August, the digital yuan was used in the domestic futures market for the first time following multiple other test runs. According to the Atlantic Council, in May 2020, only 35 countries were considering a CBDC, while now, at least 80 nations are exploring a CBDC, representing 95% of the global gross domestic product (GDP).  The ECB, which had been discussing the potential launch of a digital euro since the beginning of the year, is set to launch its much-anticipated experiment into a CBDC in October. The project follows comments made last year by ECB President Christine Lagarde that Europe had fallen behind in the global digital payments race.  “We are actually not the slowest,” Schaaf said.  Schaaf explained that the ECB cannot be compared to the central bank of the Bahamas, which was the first financial institution to issue a CBDC, the Sand Dollar, in 2020. He also cautioned against drastic nationwide experimentation like that of El Salvador. El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele kicked off a legislative process in June to make bitcoin legal tender in the country, and now it is an official currency in the Central American nation.  “Money and [the] provision of money is something you don’t play with. We cannot do huge scale experiments that rock the whole society and system. So whatever we’re going to provide, if we provide it, has to be really sound and safe,” Schaaf said.  Retail vs. wholesale  During the panel discussion, Schaaf said the upcoming ECB experiment is focused on a retail digital euro (one that individual users can use to purchase goods and services) as opposed to a wholesale euro only for banks and financial institutions.  “We see this digital Europe project as provision of a retail payment instrument … The current setup is more focused on retail that’s embedded in the mandate,” Schaaf said, referring to the ECB mandate to safeguard price stability and ensure a digital euro is not disruptive.  He also added that a layer investigating a wholesale CBDC might be added to the experiment at a later stage.  Digital euro drivers  Schaaf said that the digitization of payments and other services, the declining use of cash and the risk that foreign players might introduce a more influential currency are driving the ECB’s own investigations into a digital euro.  “So there is a concern that the monetary stability of the euro area is a bit at stake when there could be a crowding out by big techs,” Schaaf said.  He also reiterated that a digital euro will not replace cash but will complement it, acknowledging that cash usage has been declining over the last few years, exacerbated by the pandemic.  “Having said that, we will not stop issuing and providing cash, the digital euro, when it comes, would be a compliment not a substitute for cash,” Schaaf said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/15/digital-euro-isnt-guaranteed-after-experiment-ecb-advisor-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8ab689fac924ebf789c814c63003283c3aae5151-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412013,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otbtVg,1631720259,"Bitcoin and DeFi Coins Rally, Ethereum Alternatives Drop as Solana’s Outage Triggers Sector Rotation","The crypto market is witnessing a classic sector rotation in the wake of programmable blockchain Solana’s outage.  For the first time in several weeks, such decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as AAVE, chainlink a and UNI are leading bitcoin and the broader market higher with double-digit percentage gains on a 24-hour basis. Meanwhile, native tokens of the so-called Ethereum alternatives like Algorand, Avalanche, Cosmos and Solana are nursing 5-7% losses, according to data source Messari.  “After the phenomenal rally of solana and being discovered by many people as a strong contender to long-term rival for Ethereum due to its cheap gas fee and smart contracts protocols, it’s time for a reset and bitcoin has regained focus,” Laurent Ksiss, managing director of exchange-traded products at 21Shares, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “It’s clear that Solana’s technical glitches on Monday caught many by surprise, and, as a result, may have tainted its rally and premise.”  “Solana and Arbitrum’s outage was bad optics for Ethereum alternatives in general,” crypto research firm Jarvis Labs said. “What we are seeing now in the market is the rotation of money between ecosystems.”  On Tuesday, Solana’s high-speed blockchain suffered downtime as “resource exhaustion” on the network brought blockchain validation to an hours-long halt. As such, activity across Solana’s multibillion-dollar DeFi and non-fungible tokens ecosystem came to a grinding halt.  Recently launched Arbitrum, which scales Ethereum by leveraging Optimistic rollups technology to increase transaction speed and lower fees, was also knocked offline. These events drew the ire of the crypto industry bigwigs.  “Events of today in crypto just go to show that genuine decentralization and well-designed security [like Ethereum] make a far more valuable proposition than some big transaction throughput [speed] numbers coming from an exclusive and closed set of servers,” Gavin Wood, computer scientist and founder of Founded Polkadot, Kusama, Ethereum, Parity, Web3 Foundation, tweeted Tuesday.” If you can’t run a full-node yourself, then it’s just another bank.”  Solana’s SOL token chalked up more than a fourfold rally to over $200 in the three weeks to Sept. 9 as the NFT boom and high transaction fees on Ethereum drove investors to relatively cheaper and faster alternatives. Native tokens of Avalanche, Cardano and Cosmos also charted impressive rallies during that time frame, while ether remained flat at about $3,400.

42412005,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otbsxk,1631717869,Tether Denies Holding Evergrande’s Commercial Paper as Reserve for Stablecoin USDT,"Tether Ltd., the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, has pushed back against lingering speculation that its dollar-pegged currency USDT is backed by commercial paper issued by the now cash-strapped Chinese property giant Evergrande Group.  “Tether does not hold any commercial paper or other debt or securities issued by Evergrande and has never done so,” Tether external spokesperson Alex Welch said in an email on Wednesday.  Tether’s denial comes amid Evergrande’s deepening liquidity crisis. The troubled property giant with $300 billion in liabilities warned Wednesday that it could default on its massive debts. Shares in Evergrande have been in a free fall for several weeks and slid another 10% in early trading on Tuesday, reviving speculation of Tether’s exposure to Evergrande.  Commercial paper is a type of short-term debt that companies issue and usually considered to be extremely safe for investors because it’s quickly repaid. But when an issuer faces a cash shortfall, there’s a risk that the commercial paper borrowings might not be repaid in full.  Tether revealed in May that the USDT stablecoin was backed by a combination of cash, U.S. Treasurys and other assets. Nearly half of the reserves were backed by commercial paper. The company has repeatedly refused to disclose just who issued that commercial paper, instead just publishing the ratings.  The speculation over the quality of the reserves has swelled along with USDT issuance. The stablecoin’s market capitalization has tripled just this year to about $68 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  “As we have indicated in our published statements and in our most recent assurance attestation with a reporting date of June 30, 2021, the vast majority of the commercial paper held by Tether is in A-2 and above rated issuers,” Welch wrote.  The A-2 rating denotes companies considered investment-grade, or those seen by credit-rating firms as likely to make good on their debts.  “These ratings refer to S&P short-term credit ratings, where available. Where a rating is unavailable, publicly available industry-standard conversion tables have been used to convert ratings from Moody’s or Fitch to the S&P equivalent,” the statement from Welch added.  It’s still possible, of course, that the broader commercial paper market may take a hit, simply because of Evergrande’s position. When major corporate borrowers default, prices across all related assets sometimes swoon because of the interconnected nature of global markets; some investors may need to sell off their safest holdings to raise cash.  “Currently both Tether and Circle [the company behind stablecoin USDC] hold commercial paper, and while I think it unlikely that either would have large swaths of Evergrande bonds, the whole market will reel a bit,” Adam Cochran, a partner with Cinneamhain Ventures, tweeted Tuesday. “Regardless of what commercial paper you hold, bonds and commercial paper would take a hit and some issuers may even fold.”",NEUTRAL,USDT,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/15/tether-denies-holding-evergrandes-commercial-paper-as-reserve-for-stablecoin-usdt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf37bf16a6b89d608019ce97069caa60a2373f7f-1500x1137.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

2804460,https://eng.ambcrypto.com/?p=77226,1631715860,Binance Coin: This pattern might be key to a near-term rally,"Disclaimer: The findings of the following analysis are the sole opinions of the writer and should not be taken as investment advice The last few weeks have been rocky for the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume - Binance. The platform has been under regulatory scrutiny from watchdogs in countries such as U.K and Japan, while also facing investigations in U.S. and Germany. While Binance battles through a period of uncertainty, its native cryptocurrency's price seems to be unfazed by these latest revelations. In fact, BNB formed a symmetrical triangle over the past few days and presented chances of an upwards breakout moving forward. At the time of writing, BNB was trading at $294.8, up by 3.8% over the last 24 hours. Binance Coin 4-hour chart Source: BNB/USD , TradingView BNB's retracement on 21 July and its movement thereafter led to the formation of a symmetrical triangle - A pattern that sees a breakout in either direction. While the preceding trend prior to the formation of this pattern was bearish, there were indications of a trend shift in the market. The upper trendline clashed with the 4-hour 100-MA (blue) and a close above $300-305 could trigger an upwards breakout. Reasoning The Directional Movement Index noted a bullish crossover between the +DI and -DI as buyers prepared to overturn market control. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator noted receding bearish momentum and the first green bar followed by a white dot would represent the onset of a price swing. Interestingly, the MACD line had already crossed above the Signal line and its histogram suggested that some northbound pressure had already seeped into the price. The aforementioned factors indicated that chances of an upwards breakout were higher, as opposed to a downtrend. Such an outcome could result in a 15% rally towards the resistance zone of $320-$335.5. This area has been noting a high level of interest, according to the Visible Range, and could trigger a minor correction before the next upswing. Traders can make the most of this movement by setting up a long trade but a safer bet would be to wait for BNB to pierce above its 100-MA before taking a position. Levels to watch out for Entry: $303 Take-profit: $335.5 Stop-loss: $275 Risk/Reward: 1.16x Conclusion BNB's projected breakout from its symmetrical triangle presented long opportunities for traders. An entry was set just above BNB's 100-MA and at $303, while a take profit was set at the higher range of its resistance zone - An area that also clashed with the 200-SMA.

The company provides a non-custodial, decentralized exchange for trading dominance pairs and will use the funding to expand services on its platform, which tracks bitcoin and altcoin pricing using data from the cryptocurrency aggregator CoinGecko. The platform, which went live on Tuesday and is built on the Universal Market Access (UMA) protocol, enables users to trade bitcoin dominance with a clearer understanding of shifts in relative coin prices and with greater efficiency.  Bitcoin dominance is bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency calculated as a percentage by dividing its market cap by the overall crypto market cap. It indicates when bitcoin is outperforming or lagging the general crypto market and can help investors determine whether to increase or lessen their altcoin holdings.  “The idea here is simple — to satisfy a huge demand among crypto traders that was created in large part because the market lacked smooth-functioning, decentralized platforms like the one we created,” said Adrian Kolody, one of the company’s four co-founders. “We see Domination Finance as a key service for providing this popular trading functionality to a global market that features a rapidly growing number of potential users.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, Kolody said “he was over the moon” in raising a seed round after he and his co-founders financed the venture partly from their own savings.  ParaFi Capital led the round, which also included Dragonfly Capital, AU21, Shima Capital, LD Capital, Huobi Ventures, OKEx BlockdreamVentures, KNS Group, GSR, CoinGecko and angel investors familiar with the blockchain space. ParaFi invested $700,000, and Dragonfly Capital and AU21, $500,000 apiece.  “We’re product driven and that’s been a big motivation from the day we decided to work on this concept,” co-founder Michal Cymbalisty told CoinDesk. “So we’re excited to have more proper backing from major players in this space and to flesh it out into a full-fledged venture.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/15/defi-startup-domination-finance-closes-32m-seed-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eaeaa03d3cb23997a61d63048c1f1bf0aaab0c07-1080x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376300,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A5Kh,1631710540,"Damien Hirst’s ‘The Currency’ Is Just Like Money, but Is It Good Art?","On the surface, “The Currency” by Damien Hirst is a non-fungible token (NFT) collection that checks a lot of boxes for the genre. It is a series of digital works that are limited in number, minted on a blockchain and ranked by scarcity using analytics that determine the rarity of each piece based on a list of possible attributes.  Hirst, the 1990s enfant terrible, claims he is “reimagining the way NFTs are used,” because each NFT in the series is tied to a physical version that is stored in a vault in the U.K. Collectors have until July 27, 2022 to decide whether they would like to keep their NFT or exchange it for the physical painting. Any unwanted physical paintings will be destroyed, leaving the collectors with only the NFT; similarly, any returned NFTs will be destroyed, leaving the collectors with only the painting.  Sarah Meyohas is an artist and the creator of the nonexistent token and Bitchcoin.  The project, Hirst has declared, is an “experiment in belief.” Which version of the artwork will the collectors put their faith in, the digital or the physical? Exploration of NFTs and digital art seems a natural progression for Hirst, whose creative practice has frequently posed questions about the boundaries between artwork and market value.  It is my conjecture, however, that “The Currency” does not offer useful insights into the way NFTs have transformed the value of art. Instead, the project demonstrates how little Hirst has bothered to learn about NFTs and emerging Web 3.0 communities. Ultimately, Hirst’s project is a one-dimensional appropriation of a digital culture and community that he does not understand.  To begin, the structure of Hirst’s project is not particularly unique in the NFT and crypto space.  In June 2017, Larva Labs established the standard for NFT projects with the launch of CryptoPunks, a collection of 10,000 32x32 pixel semi-procedurally generated portraits. The portraits were auctioned on-chain through a smart contract designed to track which public key, thus which user, owned which portrait.  That project was so early in the emergence of NFTs that the token standard used today to build most NFT collections (including Hirst’s) had not been invented yet. The success of CryptoPunks in part inspired the development of the ERC-721 token protocol, which is now synonymous with NFTs.  It seems obvious that when Hirst decided to turn “The Currency” into an NFT collection, he took cues from CryptoPunks and other successful projects, and followed them like a blueprint. Hirst claims that his decision to make 10,000 dot paintings pre-dates the existence of NFTs, but the format of “The Currency” follows the template of traditional NFT collections to such a tee that I find that hard to believe.  I suspect that when Hirst decides that his NFT collection will have 10,000 pieces, he is doing it because that is what CryptoPunks did. When Hirst decides to dedicate an enormous chunk of his project to developing a rarity scale to create a hierarchy of value for his works, he is doing it because that is what CryptoPunks did. When Hirst decides to use the ERC-721 token standard, he is doing it because it is the standard established by CryptoPunks and other early projects.  “The Currency” is not only a derivative of CryptoPunks, it is entirely appropriative.  Despite copy and pasting the most common blueprint for NFT projects in existence, Hirst could have given “The Currency” a chance to make a meaningful contribution to the conversation about the value of digital art backed by blockchain technology if he did not completely misunderstand where the true value of NFTs lies.  The intent of the project is twofold: to force a choice between the NFT and the physical painting, but also to present each work in the 10,000-piece collection as the equivalent of a dollar bill in a “true currency” that Hirst invented. To do that, each of the physical paintings includes a watermark, hologram, signature and microdot, all elements that traditional government-backed currencies have.  The most essential source of value for crypto tokens, fungible or not, are the communities.  It is evident that Hirst wanted each piece in the collection, NFT and physical, to function as money. But that is where his misunderstanding of NFTs begins – the ERC-721 standard does not simply convert a digital image into a form of currency. Rather, it turns the artwork into a token, and tokens represent far more than merely currency in the crypto space.  Acting as a currency is the most basic function possible for a crypto token. Most serious crypto tokens, including NFTs, are intended to represent complex systems such as governance votes, permission structures or online identities, and, yes, they also function as money. But the way they function as money is unique to each token and to each community that has been built up to support each token.  Thus, the first crucial locus of value Hirst is missing with “The Currency” is the composability of NFTs. Remember the rarity tool for CryptoPunks that was developed and subsequently increased the value of Punks exponentially? The tool was developed by CryptoPunk owners and enthusiasts with the explicit intent of changing the context in which CryptoPunks were discussed and valued.  The community was able to do that because of the open-source nature of blockchain technology. The smart contract that deployed the Punks collection and the back end of the project is all visible on-chain, and can be used to build new tools and projects on top of the existing CryptoPunk project.  That ability for the community to adapt, expand and add complexity to Larva Labs’ initial project is what I mean by composability. The best and most valuable projects in the NFT space offer their communities the ability to build upon the initial project. Thus, CryptoPunk owners and those with a good reputation in the Punk community can add value and vision to the project that the creators may never have even imagined.  That all points to the most essential source of value for crypto tokens, fungible or not, which are the communities of individuals who align their digital identities with their favorite tokens and NFTs. This is the real magic of Web 3.0 and the multiverse.  Read more: The Burning Question Behind NFTs | Opinion  Crypto, and NFTs in particularly unique ways, provide digital infrastructures that groups of people can rally around and contribute to in creative ways. NFT communities, properly supported and empowered by solid smart contracts and artists who truly understand the space, will devote time and labor to improving and expanding their favorite NFT projects, which in turn increases both the social and monetary value of the tokens they hold. It’s a symbiotic culture of value exchange, where labor put into improving a project can yield tremendous returns for the individual.  NFTs are thus not merely a currency, but an entire economy; a digital society of individuals – the metaverse. I visited the HENI Discord server recently and unfortunately my thesis on Hirst’s NFT missteps were confirmed. No one in the Discord is building. The community has not been given any tools or empowerment to take ownership over the collection. The value of the work has been left solely in the artist’s hands and what remains is to determine how history will judge the contribution. The composability of the project, the decentralization of its ownership, the organic growth of the community to build something from Hirst’s start is just not there.  There is good news for Hirst, if he is prepared to broaden his understanding of the NFT space to absorb the many different types that are possible in a crypto art market. He has an audience, the tools will always be there on-chain, and it will never be too late to pivot the project toward a true exploration of the value of NFTs. He just needs to engage the community of people who have collected a piece from “The Currency” and empower them to give the project a second life in the metaverse.  The advice I would impart to Hirst is to take a more holistic, big-picture view of the role of an authentic NFT artist. Such an artist commits to a fractionalizing of the self; making oneself extremely vulnerable by allowing buyers to speculate on your future work, trade against your success or hold to see what you have in store. It’s about disintegrating your very self as an artist and your artworks into a community whose faith in you and your project must be cultivated and empowered.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sarah Meyohas,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/15/damien-hirsts-the-currency-is-just-like-money-but-is-it-good-art,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b13577bdbbaec064200ebd31615a1d98f2384431-800x585.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412012,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otbtNC,1631710201,More Than $1B in ETH Has Been Burned Since Ethereum’s London Hard Fork,"Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 was an integral piece of the London hard fork on Aug. 4. The EIP was aimed at stabilizing the transaction fee market, cementing the economic value of ether (ETH) and combating the inflation rate that comes through miner rewards. Since it was first implemented last month, some 297,000 ETH in base fees – worth over $1billion at the current exchange rate – has been “burned” and permanently removed from the circulating supply.  Six weeks after the hard fork took place, the network is beginning to reap the benefits of the upgrade. While transaction fees are still nearing all-time highs, gas price volatility has narrowed. Gas price is defined as the amount users are willing to pay for a unit of gas, measured in gwei.  There are two kinds of fees that combine to create the Ethereum transaction fee amount: the base fee and the priority fee. The base fee is the mandatory price a user must pay for their transaction to be added in a block; the priority fee, or tip, is discretionary and can be included to incentivize miners to prioritize the transaction.  The fee market upgrade in EIP 1559 implemented a 12.5% base fee increase or decrease per block, depending on the level of demand in the previous block. Post-upgrade, the miners still receive the priority fee; however, all the ether used for the base fee is now “burned” or permanently removed from the network.  Several days have even been net deflationary for the asset as base fees outweigh block rewards, and investors have noted the newfound scarcity. The burn mechanism is on pace to eliminate 2.56 million ETH that would otherwise be inflating the supply over the course of a year. At current prices this is $8.89 billion and nearly 2.2% of Ethereum’s total market capitalization.  An increased demand for “block space,” created by network usage, has been largely the result of the explosion in the non-fungible token (NFT) market. NFT marketplace OpenSea has been responsible for the burn of 42,072 ETH to date, outpacing Uniswap, wallet-to-wallet transactions and NFT trading game Axie Infinity.",POSITIVE,ETH,AXS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Edward Oosterbaan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/15/more-than-1b-in-eth-has-been-burned-since-ethereums-london-hard-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14d3cdf46ce244da8153ec46c98dcd54b32b643b-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move highlights crypto’s evolution from a fringe asset class to one under the spotlight of mainstream financial types.  “The strong demand is clearly a big endorsement by debt investors,” Julie Chariell, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Bloomberg.  A junk bond is a high-yield, high-risk financial security offered by a company and provides investors with a means of investing in debt. A company generally issues junk bonds as a way to raise capital quickly.  The company said it plans to use the net proceeds from the offering for “general corporate purposes, which may include continued investments in its product development, as well as potential investments in or acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies that Coinbase may identify in the future.”  Equal amounts of seven and 10-year bonds were sold at interest rates of 3.375% and 3.625%, respectively, and the offering is expected to close on Sept. 17.  The exchange joins Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which sold $500 million worth of bonds in June to fund its bitcoin purchases.  Coinbase went public via a direct listing on the Nasdaq exchange in April, demonstrating legitimacy to traditional investors that crypto was beginning to evolve beyond its reputation of being a retail play.

Several explicit regions like Iran and China banned bitcoin mining due to ample reasons. All the more, New York also passed a bill banning bitcoin mining performed by mining plants that are complexed on a non-sustainable source of energy for three years. Iran announced a cryptocurrency mining ban, especially bitcoin mining, amid May due to increased energy consumption in bitcoin mining due to power cuts. In addition, China banned bitcoin mining on the 19th of May by announcing a cryptocurrency crackdown. Both of these countries announced bitcoin mining nearby, but Iran has decided to lift the crypto mining ban as the ban imposed on crypto mining was temporary from day one. However, china rendered zero signs of restarting bitcoin mining in its region. Rather than mining, you can correspondingly earn gigantic profits from cryptocurrency trading.

42410980,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtu7f,1631705400,Valid Points: The Success of Ethereum’s Alternative Ecosystems,"This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Over the past few weeks, the crypto market has seen increased adoption of alternative layer 1s and Ethereum layer 2s and sidechains. Demand for cheaper on-chain activity appears to have grown by multiples as normal users have been priced out of interacting with Ethereum’s base layer. To meet this increased demand, approaches to scaling Ethereum include alternative chains like Solana and Avalanche, layer 2s like Optimism and Arbitrum, and side chains like Polygon.  As the alternatives to Ethereum’s base layer moved to the forefront of crypto, I had a few doubts as to the technology’s immediate success. From a decentralized finance (DeFi) perspective, total value locked (TVL) came and went with incentives, even on major Polygon decentralized applications (dapps). TVL measures how much capital has been parked in decentralized finance applications and is incredibly important in creating efficient markets. Decentralized exchanges need access to abundant capital to provide deeper trading markets, and lending platforms need enough capital to provide accurate interest rates.  A unique approach to onboarding third-party capital, called liquidity mining, is being used by both blockchains and applications built on top of them. Polygon, Avalanche and Fantom are providing billions of dollars in their native tokens to users supplying capital to applications. However, after liquidity mining incentives end, how does a single chain retain enough liquidity to keep its DeFi ecosystem efficient?  Outside of liquidity, I worried that Arbitrum One’s seven-day withdrawal period would push users away. A week in DeFi feels like a year in the real world, which could leave traders at a significant disadvantage. With long wait periods and volatile liquidity, I was worried layer 2s might not provide answers for which Ethereum users have been hoping .  Fortunately, I stumbled upon a u/Liberosist Reddit post, “Addressing common rollup misconceptions.” u/Liberosist immediately addressed withdrawal and composability issues, noting that interoperable solutions like Hop and Connext will allow users to bridge seamlessly using third-party liquidity.  Next, the user introduced Distributed Automated Market Maker (dAMM), a project attempting to solve liquidity fragmentation by aggregating liquidity across layer 2s into a single layer 1 pool. Liquidity providers will theoretically be exposed to trading volume across all layer 2s and traders will have access to a much larger pool of liquidity.  The road to efficient crosschain DeFi is a difficult one, but developers have been creating solutions faster than I can think of problems. I believe there will be growing pains in the short term, but the success of multiple layer 1 and 2 ecosystems will continue to make decentralization cheaper, faster and more accessible.

Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.     Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Arbitrum One’s total value locked (TVL) passed $1.5 billion within 11 days of launch. TAKEAWAY: With one dapp, Arbinyan, making up around 88% of TVL, Arbitrum is ripe for new development. Protocol builders and incentives programs have had difficulty keeping up with the demand for layer 2 usage. Early developer teams have a significant opportunity to access capital.  Yearn Finance released its quarterly report for Q2 2021 in a move that brings increased transparency to DeFi. TAKEAWAY: While on-chain data is as transparent as it gets in the financial world, the majority of non-crypto investors may have difficulty using block explorers. Dashboards like Token Terminal, and formalized reporting could expose new users to the cash flow within DeFi and attract new investors.  Total value locked metrics show DeFi speculation is still falling far short of May highs. TAKEAWAY: Investors were giving TVL nearly twice the premium during May, and governance tokens are struggling to reach their previous highs. Either the recent move has more room to run or investors are evaluating DeFi from a new perspective.  OpenSea volume is down over 50% from its highs, showing a slight cooling within the NFT market. TAKEAWAY: After peaking at over $300 million on Aug. 29, OpenSea daily volume has fallen continuously to below $100 million. However, before the start of August, trading volume rarely reached over $15 million.  Factoid of the week  Open comms  Valid Points incorporates information and data about CoinDesk’s own Eth 2.0 validator in weekly analysis.

42412016,HVp5m7xekJGhRJK4otbtiP,1631704361,HBAR Token Hits Record High as IIT Madras Joins Hedera’s Governing Council,"Blockchain-like public network Hedera’s HBAR token rallied for the fifth straight day on Wednesday, topping 50 cents for the first time and taking the month-to-date gain to 105%.  At press time, the token is trading 13% higher on the day at 56 cents, per Messari.  The rally comes a day after the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, one of the top tech schools globally, joined Hedera’s governing council to drive research and development in the distributed ledger technology (DLT) space.  The rotating governing council of up to 39 members includes the likes of IBM, Tata Communication, Boeing, London School of Economics, and decentralized finance oracle Chainlink. Each one of them runs a node, enabling decentralized governance of the Hedera public ledger.  While most other blockchains use proof-of-stake or proof-of-work consensus, Hedera describes itself as the only public distributed ledger that uses the “Hashgraph” consensus to process significantly more transactions than its peers.  Hashgraph uses a gossip protocol to send information between network nodes and reach a consensus on transactions. The process appears analogous to the way a virus spreads randomly across communities going by the official explainer below:  “Alice will choose another member [node] at random, such as Bob, and then Alice will tell Bob all of the information she knows so far. Alice then repeats with a different random member. Bob repeatedly does the same, and all other members do the same. In this way, if a single member becomes aware of new information, it will spread exponentially fast through the community until every member is aware of it.”  Essentially, transactions do not form blocks, and information travels faster across nodes.  Hedera Hashgraph recently received validation from the University College London (UCL) for having the lowest energy consumption compared with Algorand, Cardano, Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, and Tezos. Further, it has joined forces with decentralized storage network Filecoin to advance the interoperability of Web3. The partnership announced in late July rolled out an initial grant of $200,000 for NFT use cases with a long-term vision of supporting a range of distributed ledger solutions, including distributed consensus, storage, and smart data applications.  Further, crypto exchanges KuCoin and Crypto.com listed HBAR on Sept. 14, exposing the token to millions of potential investors.  The steady stream of positive newsflow may have helped HBAR scale record highs. The cryptocurrency has gained 65% and ranks second on the list of the best performing smart contract platform coins of the past seven days, per Messari.  Native tokens of several smart contract platforms, including SOL, AVAX, and FTM, have rallied by 150% in the past 30 days, thanks to the boom in the non-fungible tokens space and the congestion on Ethereum blockchain.",POSITIVE,HBAR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | HBAR,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/15/hbar-token-hits-record-high-as-iit-madras-joins-hederas-governing-council,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e393ede0b2bdb97d58641e26a26c7250a609286-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Machine learning is constantly evolving because it is a science to educate computers to act like humans in real-life situations. The role of the Internet of Things in a revolutionary society cannot be ignored. The Internet of Things can use advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms for its applications. However, because a large amount of data is stored on a central cloud server, using centralized machine learning algorithms is not a viable option due to huge computational costs and privacy leak issues. In this case, blockchain can improve the privacy of IoT networks, allowing them to decentralize without any central authority. However, it remains a challenging task to use sensitive and massive data stored in a distributed manner for application purposes. To overcome this difficult task, Federated Learning (FL) is a new type of ML. This most promising solution can bring learning to end devices without sharing private data with a central server. In simple terms, Federated Learning allows companies to share data in a &apos;closed-loop system.&apos; Federated Learning (or Collaborative Learning) As a fully decentralized machine learning technique, Federated Learning is a step up from the ...",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/tHfgumto13DU9KNyon5DyWw5Ur-z5Bww,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png

42376178,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHHzH,1631668705,"Christie’s to List Rare CryptoPunk, Bored Ape in NFT Auction","Christie’s will begin to accept bids on a rare zombie CryptoPunk non-fungible token (NFT) on Friday.  The No Time Like Present online auction, which runs Sept.17 through Sept. 28, will feature several hot NFTs, the crown jewel of which is Larva Labs’ CryptoPunk #9997, a red-eyed, bearded zombie wearing a black cap.  The auction will also include Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #8746, a cheetah-furred ape with a halo and laser eyes, and Larva Labs’ Meebit #6337, a skull-headed figurine with Lego-like limbs.  The pieces are part of the private collection of Shawn Yue, who says he started dabbling in NFTs earlier this year.  “This [idea for the auction] came across my mind as I am celebrating [my] 40th birthday this year...It is time to mark another new chapter of my life,” Yue told CoinDesk. “A lot of my friends have started collecting NFTs for a few years, and I have learned quite a lot [about] this new category from them.”  Christie’s told CoinDesk that it has seen “surging” demand for avatar projects such as CryptoPunks and Yuga Labs’ BAYC.  “Owners of these works like to use the avatars they bought as their profile pictures – you can say that these figures become their virtual persona, and owning one of the rare punks thus also becomes a status symbol,” said Laura Shao, an associate specialist for modern and contemporary art at Christie’s.  According to Larva Labs’ website, CryptoPunk #9997 was last sold in February for 99.99 ETH, equivalent to $169,770 at the time. The punk was later offered for sale in May at 450 ETH, or $1.48 million, before the offer was withdrawn in July.  Recent sales of CryptoPunks with the rare “zombie” attribute have fetched prices as high as 2,000 ETH, or $6.7 million.  “There’s something really special that goes beyond a jpeg,” said Art Blocks founder Erick Calderon at the SALT Conference in New York on Monday. Calderon, who goes by “Snowfro,” also owns a zombie CryptoPunk.  The floor price for a CryptoPunk now stands at a lofty 76.99 ETH, or nearly $260,000.  Last week, rival auction house Sotheby’s sold a lot of 101 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs for $24.4 million.  Christie’s previously sold Beeple’s “Everydays - The First 5000 Days” NFT for a record-setting $69 million in March.  “The Beeple sale spoke to a new Christie’s audience,” said Noah Davis, head of digital art at Christie’s, during the 2021 SALT Conference. “There were more than 40 bidders, with 20 bids above a million dollars. But only three of those 40-plus bidders were previous Christie’s bidders.”  Both auction houses say they plan to increase the number of digital art offerings and perhaps draw fresh capital into the world of art collecting.  “In a way, Christie’s is in the front line of bridging the two worlds together,” Shao said.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/15/christies-lists-rare-cryptopunk-bored-ape-in-major-nft-auction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eeaff729c4e491eae6c7428b364ec37bd0dcd55a-1252x1248.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376179,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwHI0X,1631666404,Fidelity Prodded SEC to Approve Bitcoin ETF in Private Meeting,"Fidelity Investments privately prodded the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week to approve its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to recent filings.  The financial services giant urged the regulator to approve its fund, citing increased investor interest in crypto. Fidelity also pointed to the rising number of investors holding bitcoin and similar funds worldwide. Bloomberg first reported the news Tuesday.  Fidelity Digital Assets President Tom Jessop, among other executives from the firm, met with SEC officials on a Sept. 8 video call.  Fidelity didn’t respond to a CoinDesk request for comment by the time of publication.  The SEC has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF. Presently, there are more than 10 applications pending, including those from VanEck, WisdomTree, and more recently, financer Anthony Scarammuci’s SkyBridge.  Fidelity originally filed its Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust in March with a follow-up response in June. Last week marked the second round of talks between the SEC and Fidelity, whose application is pending.  Purpose Investments became the first in North America to be approved for a bitcoin ETF when Canadian regulators gave their go-ahead in February.
