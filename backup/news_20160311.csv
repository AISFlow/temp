42398928,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgUy,1457734484,Bitcoin Price Hits $420 Amid Sideways Market Movement,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class.  Though the scaling debate remains in progress, bitcoin enjoyed both price stability and high trading volume in the seven days through 12:00 UTC on 11th March. Market participants traded more than 35m BTC during the seven days through 1:30 p.m. (EST), Bitcoinity figures reveal.  These trends were similar to the prior week, when bitcoin prices fell less than 1% and market participants traded more than 28m BTC.  Elsewhere, bitcoin prices crept higher between 12:00 UTC on 4th March and 12:00 UTC on 11th March, rising from $419.60 to $420.86, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). This represented a 0.2% gain.  The digital currency did experience some volatility during the week, however, as the community continued to debate whether the network was facing capacity issues.  Data from Statoshi.info shows that many data blocks this week were full to capacity with transactions, a move that industry businesses have asserted is the cause of customer complaints.  Perhaps accordingly, the currency plunged to $393.18 by 16:00 (UTC) on 5th March, a 7% decline from 12:00 UTC on 4th March, but recovered quickly, rising to $408.90 at 15:00 UTC on 6th March. Bitcoin then broke above $410 at 11:00 UTC on 7th March, hitting $414.39 by 03:00 UTC by 8th March.  For the rest of the week, the digital currency’s price mostly fluctuated between $410 and $420.  Blockchain concerns  While differing camps have proposed more than one way to solve the scaling debate, the bitcoin community has yet to embrace any particular solution. Currently, blocks can hold up to 1 MB worth of transactions, and more than one solution has been proposed to increase capacity.  This is a key issue for traders, as the perception that high fees are needed to transactions, the thinking goes, could perhaps discourage new buyers or users.  Whether the fees are 'high' or enough to discourage users remains debatable, but some traders believe that negativity toward capacity issues is being balanced out by other forces.  For example, the amount of rewards paid out by the bitcoin network is expected to halve in July, reducing the seignorage miners receive for 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of digital currency exchange BitMEX, spoke to this situation in his latest newsletter.  He further outlined the uncertainty over the scaling issue, showing how the network would operate differently depending on how or whether it is addressed.  ""Some speculate that the saving grace for miners is higher transaction fee income,"" said Hayes. ""That means either much higher fees due to network congestion (no block size increase), or lower fees but on a higher number of transactions on a network that can support more transactions (block size increase).""  Hayes notably doesn't see the issue being addressed before the July reward halving, at which point some industry observers believe the price of bitcoin could increase as the rate of new coin creation is reduced.  ""Either way, battle lines have been drawn and it doesn’t appear a solution will present itself before the July halving,"" Hayes wrote.  Still, others believe there is still optimism for an eventual solution, and that this is positively impacting price.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, a digital currency-focused hedge fund, asserted that ""the miners, exchanges and traders believe the hard fork matter will eventually be decided.""  ""There are two competing schools, and they are both releasing code,"" he said, adding:  ""There is enough uncertainty to keep the price down, and there is enough confidence to keep it up, so it’s moving sideways.""

42398923,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgQ3,1457723828,Bitcoin Lending Platform BTCJam Stops Taking New US Customers,"Bitcoin lending platform BTCJam is no longer taking new US customers, citing uncertainty around regulation in the country.  According to BTCJam founder and CEO Celso Pitta, the platform will no longer allow for the creation of new accounts from the US.  While existing users can still access their accounts, receive or make payments on loans and process withdrawals, affected account holders won’t be able to issue new loans.  Pitta said that the move was driven by regulatory issues in the US, echoing a message posted to the BTCJam website and circulated on social media earlier today that described the decision to restrict new US accounts as ""difficult"".  He told CoinDesk:  ""Our mission has always been to provide access to credit in developing countries. We decided to focus solely on that mission until there is more clarity around bitcoin regulation in the US.""  The move to start pulling back from servicing US customers is reminiscent of decisions made by some bitcoin exchanges in the wake of the passage of the BitLicense, the licensure framework put in place by New York financial regulators last year.  At the time, a number of bitcoin firms publicly denounced the BitLicense and declared their intention to stop serving New York customers.

42398927,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgTz,1457714976,UniCredit White Paper Explores Blockchain Uses for Banks,"Italian bank UniCredit has published a white paper that explores how banks could offer blockchain-based services for use cases in interbank payments and the post-trade process.  The paper, published in late February, offers a general overview of digital currencies and the underlying technology, which it notes ""has the potential of reshaping the current financial services technical infrastructure"". Written by UniCredit staffers Matteo Biella and Vittorio Zinetti, the release comes months after the bank joined the R3 blockchain consortium.  One potential application, the bank writes, is that the technology could be used for interbank payments, with participating banks acting as validating nodes on a blockchain network.  The authors write:  ""By adopting this solution, reconciliation between different databases is no longer needed, since a single ledger authoritative state is obtained by consensus. Furthermore, payments can be settled between banks without using an intermediary and virtually eliminating fees involved. Execution happens in near-real time and in a peer-to-peer fashion, reducing counterparty risk and lowering time to settlement to seconds.""  Another possible application focuses on the securities post-trade lifecycle – an area that a growing body of financial groups and market observers suggest may be one of the first areas in which blockchain tech sees future usage.  ""One possibility to simplify existing process is to represent securities and perform post-trade lifecycle on blockchain. Clearing and settlement will happen on blockchain, which will also be the depository for the assets,"" the authors state.  UniCredit envisions that, in this scenario, order matching would be done off-blockchain, and that a clearinghouse would perform novation, split orders and other functions.  According to the authors, such an approach would help cut down on the amount of administrative tasks and subsequent paper load.  ""Blockchain acts either as both clearing and settlement platform eliminating the need for reconciliation among different actors,"" the authors write. ""Contract terms execution throughout code reduces back office workload and risk of errors.""  Alternative versions of this approach, the authors go on to say, could include a network in which brokers and clearing firms act as validators.  “Even if this solution will be more complex and require coordination between a large number of participants, it will bring most benefits in terms of time reduction for trading lifecycle,” the authors conclude.

42398918,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgL8,1457707904,Consulting Firms Face Talent Shortage As Blockchain Offerings Grow,"""We're hiring, just like everyone, hiring aggressively for the right people.""  According to PwC FinTech director Jeremy Drane, the number one issue facing the blockchain industry today is a lack of talent, a declaration backed up by statements from the firm's peers.  A blockchain hiring crunch is now hitting the major professional services firms as they seek to satisfy the growing demand for products and services from global financial institutions and businesses. In interviews, global consulting firms Deloitte, KPMG and PwC indicated that they're currently seeking to hire or train employees for this area of expertise.  ""Deloitte is planning to hire more than 25,000 people in 2016, and that includes hiring across all the areas where we innovate with our clients,"" Eric Piscini, the leader of the Deloitte global cryptocurrency center, said.  Drane likened the environment to the days of the early Internet, where companies sought to train new employees on what was then an emerging technology.  He told CoinDesk:  ""[We ask] who are the youngsters, the people coming out of college, that show a tremendous interest, and what is the training program that we need to put in place so you can bring them to the client? You have to grow your own.""  Eamonn Maguire  , managing director of financial management at KPMG, echoed this view, stating that KPMG is using internal development to grow its teams, but also looking for outside expertise to improve its offerings.  ""We want to develop people internally around what blockchain is, but we’re also hiring outside of the firm,"" Maguire said. ""There aren’t tons of people out there who have this kind of expertise.""  Cross-domain talent  Drane went on to suggest that a big issue facing his firm and others is that professionals who are qualified for roles are sometimes too specialized.  PwC, he said, is looking for individuals that have tech and business expertise so that it can continue to help clients focus on use cases to explore and commercialize the tech.  ""For us, we’re looking for people that cut across all domains, and there aren’t a lot of people out there,"" he said.  Drane suggested that this was a key reason behind PwC’s decision to strike partnerships with industry tech firms including Blockstream, Digital Asset Holdings and Eris Industries.  Piscini said Deloitte is looking to hire individuals with diverse skill sets, affirming that, when it comes to blockchain, tech is ""not only a technology challenge"".  ""We are looking for very specific skills in that space, especially on cryptography, architecture, software engineering and integration,"" he said.  This talent crunch is also affecting the industry’s startup community in that they’re needing to improve their pitch to potential hires. For example, when long-time bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik and investor Matt Roszak launched blockchain services startup Bloq, they noted hiring top talent was a priority.  At the time, Roszak emphasized that Bloq would seek to maximize employee benefits, allowing them to work on a distributed basis.  ""Salary, equity, unlimited vacation, a work life balance is really key, and it’s going to be a total package,"" Roszak told CoinDesk.  Changing of the guard  Still, Michael O’Loughlin, who leads CGI Group's blockchain development, sees the hiring crunch as an extension of existing challenges in the financial industry.  According to O’Loughlin, the growing support for blockchain technology comes at a time when banks and consulting firms are already experiencing challenges hiring to replace outgoing professionals.  ""A lot of those systems legacy systems, wire payments systems, many of the folks in the bank who own the software with our support in the background are retiring,"" O’Loughlin said. ""There has not been many succession planning schemes in the banks for these roles.""  As for how that benefits blockchain, Deloitte's Piscini perhaps disagreed that the industry would immediately benefit from such challenges.  For instance, he said tech remains fast-moving, meaning many organizations are reticent to begin exploring the industry.  Still, Piscini framed the hiring challenges as not unique to the blockchain space, concluding:  ""There is shortage of talent in various areas – blockchain is not that unique.""
