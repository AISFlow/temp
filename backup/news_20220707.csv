Bitcoin Soars Above $21.5K; Other Cryptos Rise  Investors seem to have really liked the Federal Open Market Committee minutes from last month. The minutes, released late Wednesday, allayed at least some fears of the U.S. central bank's commitment to tightening its monetary policy.  Stocks rose for the fourth consecutive day and so did cryptocurrencies that have correlated increasingly over the past year to major equity indexes.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $21,600, up more than 6% over the past 24 hours and outpacing all major altcoins at one point. Since dipping below $18,500 last Thursday, the largest cryptocurrency, has risen over 16%, amid what many analysts see as just a temporary lull in investor anxiety.  ""I don't see it [crypto] recovering instantaneously,"" said Takaaki Koto, the global head of sales and trading at Japanese crypto exchange BitFlyer, on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" show.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap after bitcoin, has risen similarly over the same period and was changing hands above $1,200. Other major cryptocurrencies were firmly in the green, with SOL and CRO rising nearly 5% and 6%, respectively at one point. The increases dovetailed with stocks' gains as the tech-focused Nasdaq jumped over 2% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each increased over a percentage point.  Fed determination  The upturn has come amid a now unrelenting Federal Reserve in its quest to tame inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has suggested that more interest rate hikes consistent with the aggressive 50 and 75 basis points increases from the spring could be in the offing. “Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy, and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist,” the FOMC minutes said.  If also follows a few mildly encouraging indicators showing the economy growing less robustly than it was earlier in the year. Among the latest data, the U.S. Labor Department reported that jobless claims inched up last week, although they remain at a level consistent with a strong job market. The non-manufacturing purchasing managers index edged down.  ""Clearly, the Street remains on recession watch,"" wrote Oanda Senior Market Analyst Jeffrey Halley in an email.  Crypto good and bad news  Meanwhile, the crypto industry wrestled with a mixture of good and bad news. Ether's price seemed to benefit from optimism about the coming Ethereum Merge that will see the protocol move from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake protocol. The stewards of the TON Foundation created a new $90 million ecosystem fund, continuing recent attempts to get the Telegram-founded blockchain project back into gear.  But bitcoin miner Compass announced Wednesday that it had laid off 15% of its employees, and cut executive compensation to ride out the crypto downturn. Compass becomes the latest in a string of firms operating within the wider crypto industry to cut their workforces.  BitFlyer's Koto sees the current rocky an environment as a possible opportunity for the industry. ""Many issues are being addressed, whether it's having to cut costs or just increasing risk awareness, risk management, or just trying to improve trust in the system, whether through regulation or stability.  He added: ""These things do take time. But crypto things happen (at) fast forward speed. It might happen sooner.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,902 +1.5%  DJIA: 31,384 +1.1%  Nasdaq: 11,621 +2.2%  Gold: $1,740 -1.3%  Insights  Three Arrows Capital Court Order Reveals Interesting Details  A total of 2,319 bitcoin and 31,177 ether, or US$80 million, is the debt from Deribit trading accounts that triggered the liquidation of Three Arrow Capital, the once mighty crypto hedge fund that had nearly $10 billion under management, according to a court document filed in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).  In March 2020, at crypto’s lowest point, Deribit says Three Arrows took out a loan denominated in bitcoin and ether. On June 11 of this year, Three Arrows breached the margin requirements and two days later Deribit began to liquidate Three Arrows’s account per its instructions. Normally this wouldn’t happen as the account was a non-liquidating account (unlike what most retail plebs have at FTX) but these were exceptional times. By June 15 the account was closed and Deribit requested payment for the shortfall that amounted to $80 million.  Most of that has been reported already. But there’s a lot more that’s interesting inside the order that’s not headline material.  Safeguarding assets  For instance, the presiding Judge, ordered the overseeing liquidators to “safeguard the value of the company’s assets from market volatility.” That means converting any crypto it sees fit into dollars, or a stablecoin like tether (USDT).  So much for the underlying belief that bitcoin is an excellent store in value.  The court document also lists Su Zhu and Kelly Kaili Chen, the wife of co-founder Kyle Davies, as company creditors – meaning they are on track to be paid before others. Such an arrangement would infer the two loaned money to Three Arrows, perhaps during its earlier years. This is a common arrangement for startups but curious for one that’s been around for just under a decade and hyper-profitable until recently.  Certainly, the idea of Su Zhu being paid as a creditor during the liquidation process of Three Arrows won’t be a popular one considering the cascading institutional losses caused by the fund’s failure, alongside the massive drop in the price of bitcoin and other digital assets. But he is a creditor. For how much and why exactly will be explored at a later date as this proceeding moves through the courts.  Singapore operation  The next question is how will this affect Three Arrows’s Singapore operation. As of the close of business on July 7 in Asia, there’s no record of a winding-up order for Three Arrows with Singapore’s Insolvency Office. It could be that the firm is waiting for the process to conclude in the BVI before moving on.  But what will happen to the company’s other assets, like TPS Capital, which is kept at arm’s length? That’s going to be something for the courts to decide, and there could be a particularly bloody battle should some creditors feel they aren’t getting a fair amount while an arm’s length subsidiary of the company is still generating yield.

However, the expectation that the bear market would soon resolve and miners would once again be in the green has since gone out the window. With miner revenues continuing to plummet, miners may have to resume selling off their holdings to keep up with the market. Miner Revenues Fall For the past week, there has been no change in the downtrend in miner revenues. On-chain metrics show that it was down 0.59% from the prior seven days bringing the total daily miner revenues to $18.62 million. Mostly, it has remained flat during this time and other metrics have dived further into the red during this time.

With fees per day being so low, the percentage of the daily miner revenues which it makes up is also down, now sitting at 1.50%. Additionally, the daily transaction volumes are also down, which explains the decline in fees per day realized. This was down 9.75%, although transactions per day had seen some growth.

Nevertheless, he said he will continue contributing code to the project and remains a key player in the Bitcoin ecosystem, given both his influence in the Bitcoin community and his role at Chaincode Labs.  Bitcoin Core is the primary implementation of the Bitcoin software that connects to the blockchain. Open-source developers provide vital research, peer review, testing and documentation. A small group with commit access can directly access Bitcoin Core’s code in order to merge new code changes.  Up until now, Wuille was part of this smaller group. With his departure, only four developers remain with commit access: Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Michael Ford and Hennadii Stepanov.  He made the request to remove his key from the set of trusted keys through the Bitcoin GitHub on Thursday.  Wuille has made thousands of contributions to Bitcoin Core since 2011, most notably Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 32, which introduced seed phrases for storing and recovering private keys more easily; Segregated Witness (SegWit) which provided a new, efficient way of storing data in blocks; and, more recently, Taproot (BIPs 340, 341 and 342), which provided developers with a valuable set of tools to integrate new features that will improve privacy, scalability and security.  Over the past year and a half, several Bitcoin developers and maintainers have chosen to leave their various roles, including John Newbery, Samuel Dobson and Jonas Schnelli.

42422797,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0pirh,1657227533,Celsius Sends $500M of Bitcoin Derivative to Crypto Exchange After Debt Payoff,"Beleaguered crypto lender Celsius deposited $500 million in wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), a bitcoin derivative product of the Ethereum blockchain, to crypto exchange FTX just hours after Celsius repaid its debt to the decentralized lending protocol Maker and reclaimed $450 million of collateral in WBTC.  Blockchain transaction data shared by blockchain data firm Nansen shows that a wallet linked to Celsius sent 24,463 WBTC to the FTX in various steps.  Earlier Thursday, CoinDesk reported Celsius reclaimed 21,963 wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) tokens after it fully paid off its debt to Maker. Celsius already redeemed a 2,000 WBTC installment of the collateral on Tuesday.  Fundstrat analyst Walter Teng said that Celsius's ""de-leveraging activity on-chain will add sell-side pressure to assets that have been used as collateral,"" including WBTC, which has been the firm's largest holding pledged against its decentralized finance (DeFi) loans.  The move suggests that Celsius might sell the assets for more liquid assets, although market data on the exchange did not indicate that it had already happened. At press time, WBTC traded closely in tandem with bitcoin, changing hands at $21,600, up 6% in the last 24 hours.  Celsius halted withdrawals and all user transfers starting in June, citing ""extreme market conditions"" that led to fears that the lender might face insolvency. The firm also hired restructuring advisers, while regulators also started investigations into the crypto lender's operation in several U.S. states.  Last week, the company said in a statement that it was exploring options to ""preserve and protect assets"" in consultation with experts, which can include “pursuing strategic transactions” and “restructuring its liabilities,” as reported.

Bitcoin (BTC) lifted above $21,000 for the first time in over a week and was up 7.2% over the past 24 hours in Thursday trading.  Most major altcoins also gained with Internet Computer's ICP and Polygon's MATIC leading the charts, both up over 10% for the same period. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin, rose 8.3%.  Crypto prices have correlated increasingly to equity markets, which also rose on Thursday, with the tech-focused Nasdaq jumping more than 2% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each climbing by more than a percentage point.  Glassnode report: ETH 2.0 stakers underwater  The highly anticipated Ethereum 2.0 upgrade and transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake moved a step closer on Wednesday when Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet successfully merged its PoW chain with its PoS chain, becoming the second of three public testnets to run through The Merge.  However, most stakers are “now firmly underwater” because of locked-up ether and price declines, market intelligence firm Glassnode reported.  To become a validator on Ethereum’s Beacon Chain, which launched in December 2020, investors had to deposit 32 ether into an Ethereum 2.0 contract with no withdrawal date.  The total ETH that has been deposited has now reached 12.98 million, with 62% of tokens (8.02 million) deposited before the market’s all-time high of $4,867 in November 2021. Ether has since declined approximately 75% to trade at around $1,240.  “With spot prices currently at $1,060, this means ETH 2.0 stakers are on average holding a loss of -55%,” Glassnode wrote. “If we compare this to the realized price for the entire ETH supply, 2.0 stakers are currently shouldering 36.5% larger losses compared to the general Ethereum market.”  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $21,813 +7.2%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,249 +8.3%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,902.43 +1.5%      ●Gold: $1,740 per troy ounce +0.3%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.01% +0.1       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Celsius network pays off loans  After facing liquidity problems and halting customer withdrawals in mid-June, Celsius Network paid off a loan on the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Maker, allowing the crypto lender to reclaim 21,962 wrapped bitcoins (WBTC), equating to about $440 million.  Celsius’s CEL token momentarily climbed to a high of 92 cents but has since slumped back to around 84 cents, up 0.1% in the last 24 hours. The token is down 81% since the start of 2022.  The loans on decentralized lending platforms such as Maker are generally overcollateralized, meaning the borrower has to put up more assets in value as a backing of the loan than the value of the loan itself. Repaying the loan made sense for Celsius because it attained the valuable collateral by paying back a fraction of its value, Krisztian Sandor reported.  This comes after crypto lender Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday, becoming the second high-profile crypto firm to do so in July. As liquidity issues continue to plague crypto companies, lenders are forced to either acquire assets to repay customers or shut down altogether.

America's core democratic values are respected,"" pointing to consumer, investor and business protection, the safety of the global financial system and interoperability.

""The United States must continue to work with international partners on standards for the development of digital payment architectures and CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) to reduce payment inefficiencies and ensure that any new payment systems are consistent with U.S. values and legal requirements,"" the fact sheet said.  This work should address those concerns, the document noted.  ""Additionally, the United States will promote the adoption and implementation of international standards through bilateral and regional engagements.

The service – which will allow individuals and businesses to send and receive digital dollars – is the first crypto remittance product in Colombia to date, according to Bitso. For now, the feature will be available via the company’s website, with a mobile app soon to follow.  “These transactions are not affected by volatility at all,” said Emilio Pardo, country manager of Bitso in Colombia. “The price of the stablecoins that we use depends on the international currency market, with parity with the dollar, a great benefit to beat inflation.”  Bitso is seeking to mirror the crypto remittance service it launched in 2021 in Mexico, which processed $1 billion in the first half of 2022. The company hopes to double its volume of international transfers by year end – and to process $4 billion in 2023.  Remittances totaling $8.56 billion were sent to Colombia from abroad in 2021, an all-time record, El Tiempo newspaper reported.

42422787,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0piVh,1657221418,TPS Capital Says It's 'Independent' From Three Arrows Capital,"TPS Capital, which once described itself on its LinkedIn page as the over-the-counter (OTC) trading arm of Three Arrows Capital, said Wednesday it's an independent firm with separate management.  TPS released a statement on Twitter distancing itself from Three Arrows Capital, also known as 3AC.  Three Arrows Capital, a highly active crypto investment firm with several billion dollars in assets, shocked the crypto community last month when rumors surfaced that the firm was insolvent. Ultimately, the rumors proved true and the firm filed for bankruptcy last week. It is currently in the process of liquidating its assets with a British Virgin Islands court-appointed liquidator.  In addition to the LinkedIn page, which has since been amended, a trail of official documents from Singapore to the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands shows various links between the firms.  “TPS is an independent legal entity and its operations are separate and distinct from those of 3AC,” said the statement. “TPS is run by a separate management team and operates its main count business without the involvement of 3AC or its principals.”  “My focus is on the business and my team members at the present,” TPS Capital CEO Timothy Chan told CoinDesk.  Now, TPS, named after the Tai Ping Shan mountain on the island of Hong Kong, says Three Arrows Capital was merely a TPS client and the two entities’ cooperation was more within a “referral capacity,” with TPS serving as an “agent” or “intermediary” in financial transactions.  TPS Capital said that Su Zhu and Kyle Davis, co-founders of 3AC, both had indirect equity interests in TPS, but went on to qualify that the pair were “passive investors and do not run or have any direct control over TPS’s day-to-day operations.”  Additionally, TPS says it helped 3AC coordinate loan arrangements with various lenders, but only at 3AC’s request.  “Our most recent dealing with 3AC was limited to acting as an agent of loans between lenders and 3AC,” said TPS.  3AC’s loan counterparties included BlockFi, CoinDesk sister company Genesis Global Trading and Voyager, centralized lending desks that all faced steep losses when Three Arrows defaulted on its loans. The loans reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars for each lender, and in some cases they were undercollateralized.  Last week, 3AC counterparty BlockFi got a $400 million credit line from Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX that also comes with an option for FTX to purchase the company. The crypto lender Voyager filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday after issuing a notice of default to 3AC last month.  TPS said that it, too, was “blindsided” by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital and is now one of Three Arrows Capital’s creditors.  “We are also in the same boat with many lenders of 3AC, with our own assets exposed to 3AC, and operating with no additional information,” said TPS Capital.  TPS said in the statement that its officials are not in communication with Three Arrows Capital and have not been in communication since the firm was ordered to begin liquidation on June 27.  “As with other 3AC counterparties, our calls and messages are being left unanswered,” said TPS in a statement. “TPS intends to be open and transparent with everyone involved as the situation evolves, and will continue the work we set out to do.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/07/tps-capital-says-its-independent-from-three-arrows-capital,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42394521,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAVAt,1657219650,What Are Crypto Trading Pairs?,"Crypto trading pairs are essential for trading on crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and KuCoin. They allow users to trade one cryptocurrency for another without exchanging either for fiat currency first.  Bitcoin (BTC), the leading crypto by market cap, and tether (USDT), which is the largest stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, are frequently traded crypto pairs. You would see the pair noted as BTC/USDT or BTC-USDT depending on the exchange.  What is the purpose of crypto trading pairs?  A cryptocurrency pair allows each asset in the pair to be valued without using fiat money. Cryptocurrency trading pairs are a necessary part of the crypto economy and liquidity.  Let’s take a real-world example of trading pairs that many travelers encounter. Let’s say an American traveler was going to France on May 12, 2022. The traveler would research the exchange rate of the euro against the U.S. dollar to help budget the trip and understand the cost of things in France. The foreign exchange rate of the trading pair of EUR/USD on May 12, 2022, would have been about US$1.04 for 1 euro. So to get 1 euro, it would take $1.04.  As so with foreign exchange (forex), crypto platforms provide a variety of trading pairs as well so that their users can easily exchange one crypto for another. Crypto exchanges have responded to the huge demand for supporting as many pairs of cryptocurrencies as possible.  Another reason to use trading pairs is to decrease trading fees. If the trading pair did not exist, you would need to use at least two crypto trading pairs to obtain your desired cryptocurrency – and pay additional trading fees, as you would be committing to two trades as opposed to only one.  Here’s an example: A trader is looking to exchange dogecoin (DOGE) for Shiba inu coins (SHIB) and looks for the DOGE/SHIBA pair on a decentralized exchange (DEX). However, the DEX did not provide this trading pair.  The trader could use a more common trading pair as an intermediary to trade DOGE/SHIBA. In this case, the trader can opt for the DOGE/USDT trading pair to swap. The trader can obtain USDT by selling DOGE. Then, the trader can utilize the SHIB/USDT trading pair to finally buy the SHIB coins.  You can see how much simpler it would be to find and use a SHIB/DOGE pair instead.  To connect it back to our example of global travel, a traveler going from the U.S. to France and then to England would not need to exchange euros back for U.S. dollars because the traveler can utilize the EUR/GBP trading pair to save on fees.  Read more: How to Get Started Investing in Crypto on Popular Exchanges  How to read crypto trading pairs  Reading a crypto trading pair is easy because there are only two parts: the base currency and the quote currency.  Cryptocurrency trading pairs are often represented with a set of three letters with a backslash such as AAA/BBB.  The base currency is always the first cryptocurrency in a crypto trading pair. The base currency is the base to which the other currency is compared – if we look at our EUR/USD example from earlier, euro (EUR) is the base currency. For BTC/USDT, BTC is the base currency. The ticker before the “/” is always the base currency in crypto. Another example is ETH/BTC, in which ETH is the base currency.  The second part is the quote currency. It is the price of the base currency quoted using the quote currency. The quote currency comes after the “/”. For the trading pair of BTC/USDT, USDT is the quote currency. If we refer back to the EUR/USD example, the U.S. dollar (USD) is the quote currency.  The pairs work together to tell you how much of the quote currency is needed to equal 1 whole unit of the base currency.  From a real-world perspective, ETH/BTC was trading around 0.0695 on May 12, 2022. In other words, a trader would receive 1 ether for about 0.0695 bitcoin as bitcoin is the quote currency for ether.  Trading crypto pairs with stablecoins  Many crypto trading pairs are associated with stablecoins in crypto exchanges worldwide. You can see how stablecoins play an essential role for crypto trading pairs with major crypto exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin.  The most used and liquid trading pairs usually involve fiat-backed stablecoins such as tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD). This is also the reason these stablecoins have a high market capitalization.  Here are some popular examples of crypto pairs associated with stablecoins:  BTC/USDT  ETH/BUSD  ADA/USDC  From an investor’s point of view, using stablecoins makes it easier to calculate the value in fiat currency as the top-three stablecoins by market capitalization are pegged to the U.S. dollar. There is also an abundance of stablecoin pairs available on exchanges, giving traders easy access to buy more cryptocurrencies.

42422798,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0pith,1657218008,FDIC Probing Voyager Claims It Was Insured by Regulator,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is taking a look at claims by crypto broker Voyager that its customer accounts were protected by that U.S. agency in the event of a company collapse, an agency spokesperson confirmed.  Voyager filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this week, revealing that it had somewhere between $1 billion and $10 billion in both assets and liabilities.  The FDIC – a federal regulator tasked with overseeing bank stability in the U.S. – protects customers from losing their funds in the event of a bank collapse, insuring up to $250,000 per account. This insurance, however, usually only applies to an actual bank failure, not upon failure of the bank's client, i.e., Voyager's collapse wouldn't necessarily trigger an FDIC backstop.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the news Thursday.  In its previous advertising, Voyager appeared to be saying that its own customers would be protected by the FDIC, pointing to its accounts at New York-based Metropolitan Commercial Bank. For its part, this week Metropolitan put up a statement on its website refuting the Voyager claim.  ""FDIC insurance coverage is available only to protect against the failure of Metropolitan Commercial Bank,"" the statement said. ""FDIC insurance does not protect against the failure of Voyager, any act or omission of Voyager or its employees, or the loss in value of cryptocurrency or other assets.""  Voyager held an omnibus account at the bank for U.S. dollars, the statement added.  An FDIC spokesperson told CoinDesk Voyager is not a bank or savings association, and therefore not qualified for FDIC insurance. Voyager customers are not protected against the crypto broker's default, bankruptcy, withdrawal suspension or if its assets lose value. Voyager's customers could reach out to the FDIC if they have further questions, the spokesperson added.  Voyager, in announcing its bankruptcy filing, valued current holdings at Metropolitan to be about $350 million (it has another $110 million in cash on hand, as well as over $1 billion in crypto). Voyager said in its filing that it had moved to check that customer deposits at Metropolitan would be segregated from other Voyager assets in a bankruptcy and protected from creditors.

The FDIC&apos;s inquiry comes as account holders of Voyager Digital (OTCQX:VYGVF), a crypto broker and lender that went bankrupt on July 6 amid a broad crypto market downturn, learned earlier in the week ended July 8 that they probably won&apos;t be able to recoup 100% of their crypto.

The problem is the customer accounts are only eligible to be insured in the event of the banks&apos; failure, Metropolitan Commercial Bank said, as reported by the WSJ.

42393973,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwbP3,1657217487,What's Your NFT Really Worth? This Man Is Using AI to Find Out,"The year is 2006. The stage: an underground cash poker game in New York City. Nikolai Yakovenko takes a peek at his hand, his facial expression paused, posture slightly slouched. A pair of kings glance back at him.  With $30,000 on the table, the flop is revealed – ten of hearts, seven of spades, six of hearts. “All in,” his opponent gestures from across the table. An $80,000 bet is placed.  Yakovenko begins to crunch the numbers in his head, conjuring up the hand’s possible outcomes and their likelihoods. Moments later, he has his answer – 42%, his chance of victory. With more money on the table than Yakovenko is willing to lose, he folds.  “Maybe a bot would have played it better,” he later said of the hand during a talk at MIT’s sports analytics conference in 2018.  The sentiment – that technology can inform and even outperform human capabilities – is at the heart of Yakovenko’s life work, and has taken him around the world for poker tournaments, chess competitions and now, non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  His latest mission is to tame the Wild West of blue-chip NFT prices with an artificial-intelligence startup he founded called DeepNFTValue, which uses a pricing algorithm to assess the market value of high-priced digital collectibles like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes. (Both are collections of 10,000 computer-generated profile pictures, each with their own sets of traits and rarities.)  While NFTs from these collections have fetched millions of dollars in individual sales on NFT marketplaces (the cheapest price for a CryptoPunk with the “alien” trait is listed at over $12 million), buyers remain on their own in determining a fair price for their treasures. Even with the NFT market cooling off in recent months as part of a broader crypto downturn, Yakovenko sees this as a problem worth solving.  His expertise in doing so, melding the world of AI and statistical modeling with the unpredictable force that is human nature, dates back long before his days in crypto.  Early life  Yakovenko was born in a small town outside Moscow in 1984 to two young scientists who met on the Ukrainian national physics team. His early math talents were prodigious.  Immigrating to the U.S. with his family at the age of seven by way of Italy, Yakovenko began to code at the age of 10, enrolling in college classes at the University of Maryland, where his father was a professor, by the age of 14.  At 16, he became a full-time student at the university, taking graduate-level math courses and discovering the game of poker in the dorm rooms, later becoming a regular at higher-stakes games at an off-campus fraternity.  “I got very lucky in that the guys who played at my friend's frat were better than the players you’d meet in Atlantic City at the time,” Yakovenko told CoinDesk. “Poker was just beginning to boom, and no one knew what they were doing, including me.”  Yakovenko’s poker career began to blossom years later in New York City, where he lived during and after graduate school at Columbia University’s school of engineering and applied science, taking a full-time job at Google as an engineer on the company’s search engine team in 2006.  At 20 years old, he frequented an underground poker ring in Times Square, winning and losing more money than he ever had in college.  “I remember getting off work at Google and then going to the clubs and playing until 7 a.m.,” Yakovenko said. “You’d run up against all sorts of characters in those games. After a few months I think I had won $20,000 playing $300 buy-ins.”  Yakovenko’s poker career eventually took him to more esteemed settings like the World Series of Poker, but his most interesting games came in the underground contexts, including a stint at an infamous table run by Molly Bloom (whose story was turned into the film “Molly’s Game”) that regularly hosted high-profile celebrities, most notably Tobey Maguire.  “Tobey's actually a good player,” Yakovenko said of the actor’s time at the famed table. “Getting peddled by Spider-Man was an interesting experience.”  Like with his passion for chess at an early age, Yakovenko was obsessive about the game’s details, fixated on how deep learning and AI – two topics he had taken both a personal and professional interest in – could improve his game.  Moneyball  After leaving Google in 2008, Yakovenko found himself tinkering with the analytics of a different game: professional baseball.  What began as a passion project, blogging about statistical models and player projections, eventually caught the eye of pitch development pioneer Kyle Boddy, who was building his own baseball research brainchild, known as Driveline Baseball, across the country in Kent, Wash.  The findings of his studies, the most consequential being that it was beneficial for pitchers to throw harder (a seemingly obvious observation that was still contested at the time), led to ongoing consulting gigs with Driveline through the years, contributing in small part to the early days of a larger analytical revolution that has since changed the game of baseball significantly.  In 2012, Yakovenko suffered a traumatic brain injury during a Columbia alumni rugby match in which he was knocked unconscious and put into a medically induced coma.  After checking himself out of the hospital a week later, still unable to fully feel the right side of his body, Yakovenko waved off his doctor-prescribed therapy plan, instead opting for his own trial-and-error-tested cocktail of resistance bands, ping-pong balls, weight lifting and biking. He eventually made a full recovery.  His professional career from 2015 onward has included stints at Twitter, chip maker Nvidia and the hedge fund Point72 Asset Management, all in positions closely tied to deep learning. His projects ranged from finely tuning recommendations on user feeds at Twitter to genomics and DNA research at Nvidia; his time at Point72 was focused on algorithmic trading.  Punk revolution  When Larva Labs released its experimental on-chain “proof of concept” project CryptoPunks in 2017, Yakovenko was no stranger to cryptocurrency. He had been following bitcoin casually since 2011 and had published theoretical cryptography research of his own during his time at Columbia.  Yakovenko took interest in the collection in 2020 after noticing his old poker buddies talking about the project on Twitter, finding himself once again in the early days of a movement that would grow larger than he could have foreseen.  In the spring of 2021, Yakovenko became obsessed with CryptoPunks Bot, a Twitter account that served as a live feed for CryptoPunk sales.  He recalled a moment during Tech Week Miami where he would pull up the sale bot while riding in Ubers, asking people how much they thought each Punk was worth, trying to make sense of the discrepancies between “floor” Punks with common traits and rarer editions.  The experience would ultimately lead to an “aha” moment for Yakovenko, who figured he could create his own pricing algorithm that would be more accurate than any publicly available information.  “We were going around party to party and I'm like, ‘dude, I have to build a model,’” Yakovenko said. “I wanted to do something in crypto machine learning, but as an engineer, you have to be very careful not to be the hammer looking for the nail, right? I wanted it to be useful.”  After playing around with the model for a few months in his spare time, he founded DeepNFTValue, a company that offered just that service. The model’s current specialty is CryptoPunk prices, but Yakovenko and his team members plan to roll out a Bored Ape Yacht Club price predictor in the coming weeks. The company just raised a $4 million funding round announced on Thursday.  Users of the website can search for any individual NFT in the available collections, see their valuation history alongside its bids, offers and sales. The company also has a Twitter bot that sends out alerts for notable listings alongside real-time price estimates.  The model’s strength is that it looks at data beyond just sale prices, which on their own are a poor measure of an NFT’s value. More important than sales are the prices for active bids and listings, Yakovenko says. While a sale price determines how much a buyer was willing to pay for an NFT, listings that go untouched are equally telling for how much they aren’t willing to pay.  Yakovenko’s journey into NFTs is in many ways emblematic of the industry’s eclectic nature. NFTs, now just a few years old, aren’t a subject you study in school, and their attraction has taken most market participants by surprise. The type of people NFTs attract, too, have some commonalities – they’re comfortable with taking risks, albeit calculated ones.  “Between NFT Twitter and NFT Telegram groups, half the people you meet are former poker players,” Yakovenko said. “I’ve crossed paths with a good number of them.”  Just weeks ago, Yakovenko, who is now based in crypto hub city Miami, found himself once again back at a New York City poker table, this time filled with crypto friends in town for NFT.NYC, the industry’s premier conference.  “They were good games, even though I lost,” Yakovenko said with a grin. “I guess I got a little unlucky.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/07/whats-your-nft-really-worth-this-man-is-using-ai-to-find-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f69e535bea432bc54c0c3dddd8be69669397f74-3011x2103.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company has also signed memorandums of understanding for three acquisitions, including purchasing a 90% stake in a Latin American exchange and buying a fintech company and a software developer, both based in Spain, Ferreira added. More details will be available later this year, he said.  “In a context of many layoffs, now is the time to hold and build,” Ferreira said. “Crypto is not going to stop, no matter how much prices have fallen.”  Read more: Crypto Jobs: Who’s Cutting and Hiring?  Funding for the hiring and acquisitions will come from cash on hand, including part of the 20 million euros ($20.3 million) raised through an initial coin offering in 2021, Ferreira said, though he didn’t rule out adding capital via a strategic partner. “It is not something we need or want to close immediately,” he said. “We are open to a strategic partner coming in. It is not an obsession for us.”  In February, Bit2Me received the first license granted by the Bank of Spain as a “provider of services for the exchange of virtual currency for fiat currency and the custody of digital wallets,” the company said at that time.  In addition to Spain, Bit 2Me operates in Portugal, Italy, France, Brazil and Peru. The company has 600,000 users, 70% of whom are in Spain. Trading volume in 2021 totaled 1.1 billion euros ($1.12 billion).  The company also plans to introduce a Mastercard debit card, a futures trading platform, a lending service and a feature to allow online shops receive payments via cryptocurrencies, all this year.

42422799,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0pixh,1657213200,Decentralized Mixer Tornado Cash Makes Its User Interface Open-Source,"Today, the Tornado Cash community announced a fully open-sourced user interface (UI) for Tornado Cash Classic. This means any public contributor interested in improving the design can simply review the code and make pull requests through its GitHub. The move is in line with the community’s efforts to prioritize decentralization, transparency and security.  What is Tornado Cash and how does it work?  Tornado Cash is a decentralized mixer protocol that enables private transactions on Ethereum. Mixers are smart contracts that accept, pool and mix cryptocurrency from multiple senders in order to increase privacy by obscuring potential audit trails. Users send ether to the Tornado Cash smart contract and upon withdrawal, that ether is sent to a new public address that has no link to the sending address.  Read more: Bitcoin Mixers: How Do They Work and Why Are They Used?  Why focusing on UI is critical  The Tornado Cash community is intimately familiar with UI vulnerabilities. In February 2020, a developer discovered a bug that revealed private user details when someone clicked a “share” button from the interface. The bug was quickly resolved and no funds were lost. This is a prime example of how open-source projects benefit from having many eyeballs on a product, which makes it easier to spot and fix vulnerabilities. The irrevocable nature of smart contracts means wallets and mixers like Tornado Cash must make it safe and simple for unsophisticated users to send and receive funds.  In its announcement, Tornado Cash emphasized, “We personally grew fond of the black and green floating astronaut associated with the protocol. However, you should know our credo by now: We will always lean towards more decentralization.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/07/decentralized-mixer-tornado-cash-open-sources-its-user-interface,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3642cb9492b95334f4908625ef30ab92dd713c44-5324x3993.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Ether leads the way today with a 4% increase, perhaps on the speculation over the upcoming network update dubbed ""The Merge.""  Market Moves: A look at the class-action suit filed in California last week accusing key players in the Solana ecosystem offf illegally profiting from SOL.  Price point  Crypto markets were mostly in the green, with ether (ETH) taking the lead, up 4%, while stock futures edged higher ahead of the U.S. jobs data release scheduled for Friday.  Investors in the U.S. awaited the jobs report from the Labor Department, which is released on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Bitcoin (BTC) was down 3% over the last 24 hours, whereas ether was up by 4.3%, making it one of the top performing altcoins on the day.  Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at Hashdex, said that ETH’s uptick could be related to the optimism surrounding the upcoming Ethereum blockchain Merge. “This has encouraged a lot of retail investors to preempt an investment strategy for ETH,” said Kssis.  “But it may be short lived as there are still strong sell orders in the market supported by ETH liquidations,” Kssis said.  In traditional markets, the British pound was up slightly on Thursday after the news surfaced U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would resign.  The departure is likely to delay the country's plans to create a friendly environment for the crypto industry.  Against the U.S. dollar, the pound lifted to $1.20 from $1.19, where it was Wednesday.  Meanwhile, after the news that Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, shares of the broker have been suspended from trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange as it looks at whether the shares meet its listing requirements.  Genesis Global Trading, a CoinDesk sister company, has confirmed exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Genesis’s CEO Michael Moro confirmed Three Arrows Capital was the large counterparty that failed to meet a large margin call in June, forcing liquidation of the related collateral.  Adding to the list of departures moving from traditional finance over to crypto is another JPMorgan (JPM) executive, Eric Wragge, a former managing director at the bank. He joined the Algorand blockchain as head of business development and capital markets.  And finally, the developers behind meme coin, SHIB, has teased plans to expand the Shiba Inu ecosystem with a decentralized stablecoin. More on that here.  Market moves  By Danny Nelson and Nikhilesh De  A class-action lawsuit filed in California federal court last week accuses key players in the Solana ecosystem of illegally profiting from SOL, the blockchain’s native token that according to the suit is an unregistered security.  “The cornerstone of the value of SOL securities is the sum of Solana Labs, Solana Foundation and [Anatoly] Yakovenko’s management and implementation of the Solana blockchain,” the suit alleged. It described SOL as a highly centralized cryptocurrency that has benefited its insiders to the detriment of retail traders.  Filed by California resident Mark Young, who said he bought SOL in late summer 2021, the suit names Solana Labs, the Solana Foundation, Solana’s Anatoly Yakovenko, crypto VC giant Multicoin Capital, Multicoin’s Kyle Samani and trading desk FalconX.  A Solana spokesperson declined to comment. Multicoin and FalconX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  According to the complaint, Young alleges that the way SOL was created and sold meets the three tenets of the Howey Test, a U.S. Supreme Court precedent commonly used as a barometer for whether the sale of something is a security or not.  “Purchasers who bought SOL securities have invested money or given valuable services to a common enterprise, Solana. These purchasers have a reasonable expectation of profit based upon the efforts of the promoters, Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation, to build a blockchain network that will rival Bitcoin and Ethereum and become the accepted framework for transactions on the blockchain,” the filing said, addressing the three forks of the Howey Test.  In the filing, Young pointed to several sales of the SOL token or agreements to sell the SOL token ahead of the public sale of the token.  Solana Labs filed a Form D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (a filing saying the sale was of securities exempt from SEC registration), noting the company was selling “the future rights” to around 80 million SOL, according to the filing.  Multicoin, a major crypto venture capital firm that has invested heavily across the Solana ecosystem, “offloaded millions of dollars of SOL” onto retail after “relentlessly” promoting the token in spite of Solana blockchain’s tech issues, the suit alleged. This alleged offload passed through FalconX over-the-counter trading desks, the suit said.  Young’s law firm, Roche Freedman, also recently filed suit against Binance.US for allegedly misleading investors during the Terra implosion. A lawyer for Roche Freedman did not pick up the phone.

The new TON Alpha-Vista Fund (TAV) has VistaLabs, Alphanonce, Miner’s Fund and Kilo Fund among its backers, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk.  The fund's aim is to establish new projects on TON and promote its user as a layer 1, or base, blockchain through advisory services and financial backing.  TON is a proof-of-stake blockchain originally created by Telegram in 2017, but which was shut down by the messaging app in August 2020 following legal action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging that it had run an unregistered securities sale.  The reincarnated project, also referred to as Toncoin – named after the blockchain's native token – is the work of members of the original community who wished to see it survive. It claims to be entirely separate from Telegram, though it does have CEO Pavel Durov's endorsement.  Those stewards of the project – known as the TON Foundation – have been busy in recent months attempting to renew interest and engagement with it.  In April, the foundation raised $250 million for its first ecosystem fund with the venture arms of crypto exchanges Huobi and Kucoin among the investors.  Later that month, around $1 billion was raised via 176 different donations from users who wished to see the ecosystem advanced.  Shortly after, toncoin was integrated into the @wallet bot on Telegram allowing users to send and receive TON within the app.  Read more: Arrington Capital Launches $100M Growth Fund for Moonbeam Ecosystem  UPDATE (15:20 UTC July 7 2022): Adds reference to $1 billion raised from TON users in April  UPDATE (16:20 UTC July 7 2022): Amends headline and first paragraph removing references to TON Foundation raising the $90 million",POSITIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TON,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/07/ton-foundation-raises-90m-for-new-ecosystem-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e8fae70b0af8d8650e6dcbce6291b0bd34321ec-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394528,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAVpv,1657205783,From stETH to wETH to Gwei: Understanding the Different Shades of Ethereum,"If you have been in crypto for a while, you might have heard of “sat,” short for satoshi, a tiny unit of bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoiners say they are “stacking the sats” when they buy bitcoin. Well, there's a version of that in Ethereum. It’s called gwei, a small unit of ethereum that’s used when talking about gas fees, or the network charges. But there are many other denominations beyond gwei, and indeed, many tokens associated with ether (ETH).  Then there are oddities like wrapped ether (wETH), which represents the same value as ETH but is a technically different version of it. And there are tokens that represent staked ether deposits, such as stETH.  See Also: How Does Ethereum Staking Work?  If you can’t tell your gwei from wei or wETH from ETH, you may end up making a costly mistake. Millions of dollars are reportedly stuck on-chain as many users of the Coinbase trading platform try to deposit wETH to their Coinbase ETH addresses. In this guide, we break it all down.  What are gwei, wei and other Ethereum denominations?  Just like a U.S. dollar can be broken down into nickels and dimes, ether can also be denominated in smaller units.  The smallest ether denomination is called wei. It’s named after cryptographer Dai Wei, one of the early cypherpunks who proposed Bitcoin predecessor b-money in the 1990s. One wei is worth a quintillionth of one ETH. Put another way, one ETH is worth 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei.  All other denominations make reference to wei in their names, but you really don’t need to know most denominations because they are almost never used in any context. Let’s focus on those that matter.  Despite the seemingly infinitesimal value, wei is important because it’s a reference denomination sometimes used in smart contracts. In March 2022, one non-fungible token (NFT) investor lost $1 million when he listed an EtherRock NFT for 44 wei, instead of 44 ETH as he intended.  The most commonly used of all ETH denominations is gwei, which stands for giga wei. One gwei is worth a billion wei. It's popular because Ethereum’s transaction fees, called gas fees, are calculated in gwei. Instead of saying the Ethereum base gas cost is 0.00000001 ETH, it’s easier to say 10 gwei.  Other denominations include kwei (kilo wei) and mwei (million or mega wei). One kwei corresponds to one thousand (1,000) wei, and one mwei is one million (1,000,000) wei. They’re almost never used in practice.  What is wrapped ether (wETH)?  Odd as it may sound, Ethereum’s native token ether isn’t compliant with the blockchain’s most common token standard, which is known as ERC-20. The ERC-20 standard was proposed in 2015 and finally became the norm for fungible tokens, like USD coin (USDC) and maker (MKR), in 2017.  Decentralized apps on Ethereum typically work with ERC-20 tokens. Since ETH isn’t ERC-20 by design, it needs to be made compatible. The process by which ETH is converted to an ERC-20 is called “wrapping.” Unwrapping WETH means reversing the token back to its original state, the good old ETH.  On most platforms, such as decentralized exchange Uniswap, ETH is automatically converted to wETH in the background. But others require you to first wrap ETH yourself. These include NFT marketplace OpenSea (on which wETH is needed to make offers) and decentralized exchange aggregator CowSwap (where you will have to convert ETH to wETH before any trade).  Read More: OpenSea Marketplace: How to Buy, Sell and Mint NFTs  WETH is tradable for ETH on a 1:1 basis at all times. You can wrap and unwrap ETH directly on decentralized exchanges or indirectly through the MetaMask browser extension. Remember that you will have to pay gas to wrap and unwrap your tokens.  What are stETH and other staked ETH tokens?  To stake ether, you will need 32 ETH. That’s a lot of ETH for one person, and so staking pools like Lido Finance let users combine their ETH and stake it with a validator. Centralized crypto exchanges like Binance also offer a similar service.  When you stake ETH with a service like this, you receive tokens that represent your staked ETH position. 1.5 stETH represents your initial deposit of 1.5 ETH.  Staked ether tokens and their issuers include:  aETHc (Ankr)  BETH (Binance)  rETH (Rocket Pool)  stETH (Lido Finance)  These tokens will be redeemable for ETH on a 1:1 basis after the Merge, a key milestone in the Ethereum blockchain's transition to proof-of-stake, is complete. The date of the Merge has yet to be determined, however. On top of the initial deposit, the tokens also represent a proportional share of the accrued staking rewards, which is about a 4% annual percentage rate.  But these tokens aren't necessarily tradable for ETH on a 1:1 basis prior to the Merge as their value is subject to natural market conditions, which we will get into next.  Is stETH pegged to the price of Ethereum?  Lido Finance’s stETH is the most popular token that represents staked ether deposits. Since its inception, stETH has traded as low as 0.92 per ETH and as high as 1.05 per ETH. Despite trading at around 1 per ETH during much of late 2021 and early 2022, stETH fell to a larger discount in mid-2022 after big wallets like the one that belonged to hedge fund Three Arrows Capital exited their stETH positions to raise liquidity.  The mass sell-off during the 2022 crypto crash pushed down the price of stETH in proportion to ETH, leading some commentators to suggest that stETH might depeg from ETH. However, stETH isn’t pegged to ETH.  This is also true for other tokens that represent staked ETH positions, such as BETH or aETHc.  Why does the stETH trade at a discount to ether?  Even though stETH is the same as ETH over the long run and also comes with a claim on staking rewards, it still trades at a discount to ETH’s current market price. That’s mainly because the token is backed by time-locked ETH, a highly inflexible underlying asset that’s also subject to various risks.  The risks associated with stETH and the underlying locked ETH include:  Systemic risks (smart contract or validator)  The Merge execution risk (further delays, cancellation or other technical issues)  Less liquidity than ETH  One person’s risk, however, is another person’s opportunity. For investors with a big appetite for risk, stETH and other similar tokens represent an opportunity for buying ETH that’s only cheaper than the market price.

The update was initially referred to as Eth2 or Ethereum 2.0, though the foundation has changed its name to Ethereum Merge. According to co-founder Vitalik Buterin, the decentralized digital currency will transition from its proof-of-work phase to its main network in August. Some experts believe that there is potential for Ethereum to undergo a massive surge in price. Despite the recent highs of around $4,800, the price of Ethereum has remained relatively stable at about $2,000. However, Ethereum bulls are hopeful that the incoming merge will take the price higher than the coin&apos;s ATH value and user in a crypto bullrun. Still Below the $2K Position A few weeks ago, the value of Bitcoin fell so low that it failed to reach its $30,000 mark, causing the price of Ether to plummet.

42374319,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZAiB,1657203404,Euro’s Fall Toward $1 Parity: What It Means for Crypto,"The euro's fall toward $1 for the first time in 20 years – approaching so-called parity with the U.S. dollar – is turning some crypto traders' focus to the exchange rate’s impact on crypto valuations and to stablecoins linked to the European common currency.  Thanks to the emergence in recent years of stablecoins tied to government-issued currencies besides U.S. dollars, the vast realm foreign exchange has been slowly creeping into digital-asset markets.  And some observers say the euro's latest slide could inject bearish pressures into the bitcoin (BTC) market and influence demand for euro-pegged stablecoins.  ""Currency turmoil (such as that currently experienced by the euro and others) usually ends up favoring the U.S. dollar, as forex market participants see it as the 'least risky' currency. This is accentuated by the divergent interest rate paths between the U.S. and the EU,"" said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at the crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading. ""This could negatively impact the price of bitcoin in dollar terms, which for the past couple of years has been negatively correlated with the dollar index."" (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.)  The euro has depreciated by 10% against the dollar this year, a significant move for major fiat currency pair. The exchange rate was last seen trading near 1.02, or 200 pips short of the parity level of 1.00.  The decline seems to have stemmed from the European Central Bank (ECB) lagging behind the Federal Reserve (Fed) in tightening monetary policy despite rising inflation, the threat of a full-blown energy crisis in the European Union and recession fears.  ""There are evident risks of a recession nowadays and the curtailment of excess dollar margin funding from the securities markets,"" Gregory Klumov, CEO of stablecoin platform Stasis, said in an email. Stasis is the issuer of euro stasis (EURS), which is the world's second-largest euro-pegged stablecoin as per market value.  ""When this happens, all borrowers buy back dollars to pay back the loans they took out to improve returns and increase their exposure to risky assets,"" Klumov said. ""Therefore, when assets are sold and funding is returned, the dollar grows. The euro is no exception in this case.""  The currency market pundits are convinced that the ECB will continue to lag, allowing EUR/USD to slip well below 1.00. Engineering a lift-off from a record negative interest rate of -0.5% is easier said than done for the ECB as hawkish expectations recently saw Italian bond yields collapse relative to their German counterparts, raising fragmentation risks. Fragmentation essentially means as the central bank raises rates, the impact of the tightening is not felt in the same way across the common currency area.  Financial markets are driven by sentiment, so when a major national currency like the euro is trampled and pushed toward or below critical levels, investors tend to move out of risky assets, fiat currencies and seek refuge in established safe havens like the U.S. dollar and government bonds. Therefore, EUR/USD's drop to or below 1.00 could spur broad-based demand for the greenback, pushing lower bitcoin and other risky assets.  While bitcoin believers have long hailed the cryptocurrency as a haven asset, historically the digital currency has moved in tandem with technology stocks and in the opposite direction to the dollar index (DXY). For instance, the DXY, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, has rallied nearly 12% this year. Meanwhile, bitcoin and Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index have tanked 55% and 27%, respectively.  Not that things couldn't change. But that's mostly been the pattern.  Focus on euro-pegged stablecoins  Euro-pegged stablecoins could lose their shine.  Stablecoins are tokens tracked by a blockchain and intended to consistently match the purchasing power of a fiat currency, like the dollar or the euro. The issuer of the stablecoin promises that users or holders of the stablecoin can redeem the investment anytime at a one-to-one exchange rate.  The structure exposes the user to exchange-rate risk. For instance, assume a trader named Bob purchased one euro-backed tether stablecoin EURT a month ago. Theoretically Bob can redeem EURT for one EUR anytime. However, EUR/USD has declined by 4.2% from 1.065 to 1.02 in four weeks. So, if Bob redeems EURT today, the redemption would yield a loss of 4.2% in dollar terms, assuming he didn't earn additional yield by lending out the asset on the decentralized lending and borrowing protocols.  Therefore, holders of euro-pegged stablecoins may opt for redemptions, given the bearish outlook for the common currency.  ""Overall, 1.0 is an important psychological level,"" Dessislava Aubert, senior research analyst at Paris-based Kaiko, told CoinDesk in an email. ""If it breaks, it will most likely spur some FX volatility in the short run, spilling into other asset classes, including crypto, and trigger selling of euro-backed assets.""  Laurent Kssis, managing director and head of Europe at crypto exchange-traded fund firm Hashdex, said the euro-pegged stablecoin market may get tested for its robustness and come under pressure.  Investors are already moving out of the euro-denominated and euro-backed assets, according to Stasis' CEO Gregory Klumov. ""In a situation where an outflow of capital from euro assets, euro shares and euro bonds takes place, it can be observed that the euro stocks are falling more than the American indices over the past few weeks. And of course, euro stablecoins are falling deeper relative to their dollar counterparts,"" Klumov said.  ""Since the dollar remains the #1 benchmark for determining prices in the cryptocurrency realm even for European users, the euro stablecoin is perceived as a risky asset (although the EURS is not a risky asset by any chance). There are outflows from the euro stables happening right now and investors will change everything into dollars in such a situation,"" Klumov added.  One question is whether potential redemptions and volatility in the euro-pegged stablecoins would have a Terra-like contagion effect on the broader crypto market. The answer is probably no because the euro-pegged stablecoin market is quite small.  The euro-pegged stablecoin market was worth $440 million at press time. That's just 0.29% of the dollar-pegged stablecoin market value of $151 billion, according to data tracked by CoinGecko. Cryptocurrencies more broadly have a market capitalization of $950 billion.  The biggest euro-pegged stablecoin at press time was the euro-backed tether, or EURT, with a market value of $210 million. Euro stasis, or EURS, the second-largest euro stablecoin, had a market cap of $126 million. Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST had a market cap of $18 billion before it collapsed in mid-May, dragging the crypto market lower and leading to volatility in the broader stablecoin market.  ""Euro-backed stablecoins are still such a small portion of the overall market that any redemptions the current euro weakness might trigger would not materially impact the overall market cap,"" Acheson said.  As of writing, EURT traded at a slight discount, just below the 1 euro peg on Bitstamp, having dropped to 0.96 euro on June 20. The peg broke after UST’s collapse in mid-May. Meanwhile, the euro tether traded at a slight premium on crypto exchange FTX.  Zero-sum game and ECB rate hikes  The currency market is a zero-sum game. When we say the euro is likely to lose ground against the dollar, it also means the dollar is expected to rise and there is incentive to hold the greenback-pegged assets.  So while the EUR/USD slide may dent the appeal of the EUR-pegged stablecoins, it could spur demand for the dollar-pegged stablecoins. With the Fed raising rates aggressively to tamp inflation, traders already have a solid reason to hold the dollar-pegged stablecoins.  Besides, the ECB is widely expected to exit the negative interest rate policy this year, which may eventually bode well for the euro and assets backed by the common currency. Circle, the issuer of the second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoins USDC, recently launched a new euro-backed stablecoin called EUROC, perhaps in hopes that ECB’s rate hikes would translate into demand for euro-backed assets.  Interest-rate traders expect the ECB to raise the benchmark borrowing costs by 140 basis points (1.4 percentage point) by the end of the year. The central bank's benchmark interest rate currently stands at -0.5%.  ""Rising interest rates will benefit yield products, like stablecoins,"" Bill Cannon, head of exchange-traded product portfolio management at Valkyrie, said. ""Similar to traditional foreign-exchange strategy, utility depends on the use of the product, and it is our understanding that opportunities are limited in the euro-denominated stablecoin products at this time. But just like everything else crypto, that could change quickly.""

42374320,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZAgv,1657203016,Johnson's Exit as British Prime Minister Leaves UK Crypto Ambitions on Hold,"The departure of Boris Johnson as U.K. prime minister leaves a big question about the future direction of crypto policy in a country that only recently declared its intention to set itself up as a crypto hub.  For now, the resignation will likely disrupt the government’s legislative agenda, including on issues like stablecoins, and it raises the question of whether the next administration will be as pro-Web 3 as Johnson's administration was.  This week, a drip of resignations, starting with Treasury Chief Rishi Sunak, turned into a torrent that made Johnson’s departure inevitable.  His leaving follows a series of scandals in which Johnson was fined by the police for hosting parties during the COVID-19 lockdown that he himself imposed and most recently concerns he had ignored sexual-harassment allegations in appointing Chris Pincher to the senior post of deputy chief whip.  Johnson’s ruling Conservative Party must now select a new leader. The party members in Parliament will hold a series of votes to get to the final two candidates, who will then face a vote by the broader Conservative Party members.  The winner will then become prime minister and select a new slate of ministers. The last time round, the process took about two months, from Theresa May announcing she was stepping down in May 2019 to the nomination of Johnson as her successor.  As recently as Wednesday, Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe was promising a bill on stablecoins by August. The industry has previously hailed the regulatory clarity expected from the law, but its future now lies in doubt.  Read more: UK Crypto Industry Hopes for More Clarity From Planned Stablecoin Rules  Nadhim Zahawi, Sunak’s successor, who was appointed Tuesday as the new head of the Treasury, has plenty on his plate to deal with, including the rising cost of living caused by higher food and energy prices.  While Zahawi can still make the decisions needed to keep the economy running, procedural government guidance says interim ministers shouldn’t bring forward new initiatives with long-term consequences. In any case, with more than 50 resignations in recent days, it’s not clear that there’s enough ministerial manpower to shepherd a bill through.  Possible successors  Sunak’s departure sealed Johnson’s fate, but also improved his own chances of becoming the next prime minister, according to betting markets cited by the Guardian newspaper.  From a crypto perspective, Sunak’s position is both known and broadly positive. In April, he described his “ambition to make the U.K. a global hub for crypto-asset technology” and asked the country’s Royal Mint to issue a non-fungible token (NFT).  There’s no formal slate of candidates yet, and many of those expected to run have made few comments about crypto.  In 2020, Liz Truss, then trade minister and now responsible for foreign affairs, said the U.K. exit from the European Union was an “opportunity to … really lead the world in areas like artificial intelligence and blockchain.”  Penny Mordaunt, another widely tipped candidate, seemed enthused after a meeting with the Texas Blockchain Council in April, suggesting there could be opportunities for the U.K.’s own financial center in London.  Read more: Boris Johnson to Quit as Pressure From Ministerial Resignations Mounts  Ben Wallace, the defense minister who has topped some recent polls, has most prominently referred to the risk of cryptocurrency being used for money laundering in his previous role as minister for security.  Meanwhile, Matt Hancock, a lawmaker who has championed the cause of crypto by calling for a liberal tax and regulatory regime and who stood for the leadership in 2019, has told the media he won’t be doing so this time.  Crypto, not bitcoin  Others’ public positions are more nuanced, including those of some notable bitcoin skeptics.  Tom Tugendhat, House of Commons foreign affairs committee chairman, was one of the first to throw his hat into the ring for the as-yet-unavailable prime minister post back in January. In previous tweets and parliamentary speeches, he’s said he’s “bullish on ether and not bitcoin,” and called for a Treasury legal framework to support what he’s called a “fundamental rewriting of ownership models.”  Steve Baker, a lawmaker who formerly sat on the House of Commons Treasury Committee and served as Brexit minister, has suggested he might also stand as a candidate. In a 2014 parliamentary statement, he said he welcomed crypto as a way “to move away from state money.”  “Every obstacle to the creation of alternative currencies within ordinary commercial law should be removed,” Baker said, although he added that bitcoin was “imperfect and possibly doomed.”  Ultimately, though, the crypto community is going to be left guessing for a while. Comments made almost a decade ago may offer little insight into a new prime minister’s strategic direction, still less that of his or her finance minister – and the British political class has left few clues to go on.  A report in May by advocacy and research group SEC Newgate UK found that the country’s lawmakers had been “almost silent” on the topic of crypto and blockchain, raising the risk that the U.K. has become a “laggard” in the growing sector.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/07/boriss-exit-leaves-uk-crypto-ambitions-on-hold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d41aa99a0e65db69eeb4ed66dfef82eabdd0ac76-5601x4201.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Reddit did not refer to the avatars as NFTs in its post. The firm, however, added that blockchain technology remained a part of its long-term plans: “We see blockchain as one way to bring more empowerment and independence to communities on Reddit.”  Earlier this year, Reddit began testing a feature that allowed users to set any Ethereum-based NFT as their profile picture. In 2021, Reddit released limited-edition NFTs called CryptoSnoos, based on its mascot “Snoo.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/07/reddit-launches-polygon-based-collectible-avatar-marketplace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbf9d32ffbbf977cac22be3b02601d8cda5014c0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This suggests that the price of BTC may be preparing for a positive comeback this year. Compared to more well-known asset types, bitcoin prices are significantly harder to forecast and more sensitive to market forces because of the uncertainty and recent price decline. Related Reading | U.S. Federal Panel Claims Cryptocurrencies Can Boost The Economy, Will It Result In Bullish Trend? In 2021, the price of bitcoin doubled, but in January 2022, it saw a significant decline that nearly wholly reversed the gains made the year before. For now, BTC remains well behind its all-time high price of $68,000 in November due to the ups and downs of the market. Even over the previous six months, Bitcoin has only briefly risen above $45,000. Comparatively speaking, Bitcoin has a significantly longer track record than other cryptocurrencies. However, with price variations, BTC is still worth more than twice as much as it was only a few years ago.

Connect moves the shield out further, allowing users to privately connect to Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, including popular apps Uniswap, Lido and Aave. Private DeFi actions could include staking, lending, swaps and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) treasury management. The Aztec network includes zero-knowledge rollup technology, which essentially bundles transactions before sending them to the Ethereum mainnet, saving money on transaction or gas fees.  Aztec Connect is intended to allow anyone to add privacy to Ethereum applications through either bridge contracts (interfaces connecting Ethereum smart contracts to Aztec’s underlying rollup technology) or a software development kit (SDK) that lets developers integrate their apps with Connect.  The original zk.money protocol has also received an upgrade so that users can now access DeFi interactions that are private by default, beginning with liquid staking through Lido and the fixed rate vaults of Element Finance.  “Our belief is that public and private applications will have to play seamlessly together in the future,” said Wu. “Aztec Connect is a great example of how you can seamlessly add private functionality to public applications.”  Read more: Ethereum Privacy Startup Aztec Raises $17M in Paradigm-Led Series A",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | UNI,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/07/aztec-launches-defi-privacy-bridge-aztec-connect,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d27892332e9ccc8b1874a7d9300e1b5e6bbb2695-2276x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The protocol had more than $9 million worth of cryptocurrencies stolen from its platform over the weekend in a flash loan attack. Flash loans allow traders to borrow unsecured loans from lenders by relying on smart contracts instead of third parties.  “The hacker agreed to take 45455 SOL as the white hat bounty,” the developers said in a tweet. “Now we have confirmed the receipt of 6064 ETH + 23967.9 SOL in the four transactions.”  The developers said a compensation plan will be released in 48 hours for users affected by the attacker.  The protocol allows liquidity providers to set specific price ranges, add single-sided liquidity and conduct range order trading. This makes for a sophisticated and decentralized trading platform.  The exploit involved the attacker creating a fake tick account on Crema. A tick account is ""a dedicated account that stores price tick data in CLMM,” the developers said, referring to Crema's market-making protocol. After that, the attacker exploited a command by writing the data on the fake account and circumventing security measures.  A flash loan was then used to manipulate the prices of assets on liquidity pools.

On-chain data shows that a wallet linked to Celsius repaid the remaining $41.2 million of the loan in DAI, the Maker protocol's stablecoin.

Lee rose to become the chief financial officer and chief operating officer for the consumer product group at PayPal (PYPL) during her eight-year tenure at the consumer payments giant. Most recently, she held the title of chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Acorns, a micro-investing app company.  “Jasmine is a rare talent who possesses more than 20 years of deep knowledge in both fintech and high-growth startup environments,” said Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder in a statement. “Her experience at PayPal, a public Fortune 500 company, in particular, will be invaluable as we chart our path to an IPO in the coming years.”  Binance.US, which launched zero-fee bitcoin trading last month, appears to be focusing on increasing its consumer reach even as the cryptocurrency market has soured. The exchange is also looking to raise an additional $50 million in funds after closing its $200 million seed round in April.  “I look forward to building out a best-in-class finance department at Binance.US that lays a strong foundation for continued growth and our path to a future IPO,” said Lee in a statement.

Shares of SI are rising 1.2% in premarket trading, as bitcoin (BTC-USD) +1.5% drifts up to $20.4K. Deposit inflows/outflows at Silvergate (SI) generally depend on customer behavior from a variety of crypto market factors such as price, volatility and regulation, Berman wrote in a note to clients. Specifically, average digital currency deposits are 93% correlated to a combination of &apos;1) QoQ change in price of bitcoin; 2) avg. bitcoin price volatility; and 3) QoQ change in total volume traded,&apos; according to the note. That relationship implies average deposit growth between +10% and -10% in the second quarter, Berman noted. Taking into account that Silvergate&apos;s earnings are &apos;highly sensitive&apos; to changes in the size of its deposit portfolio, Berman is expecting Q2 EPS of $0.82, or 6% below consensus. The Quant Rating, meanwhile, screens Silvergate (SI) shares as a Sell with the poorest mark in momentum, while the Average Wall Street Analyst views the stock as a Strong Buy (7 Strong Buy, 3 Buy, 1 Hold).

42393819,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBL9F,1657198200,Crypto Winter Has Arrived. Here’s How Advisors Can Help,"Winter in New York’s North Country is cold. So cold that the dim January sun and howling winds along the St. Lawrence River can leave wind chills well below freezing for an entire month or more, even in an era of warming global climates.  In such conditions, winter weather gear wasn’t optional like it is now in many parts of the U.S. – children don’t forget their hats and gloves, and waterproof boots and wool socks are necessities to avoid potential loss of limbs due to frostbite.  Those lessons should serve me well as “crypto winter” descends upon us. Not only are asset prices well down from their highs across almost all of the crypto ecosystem, but we’re starting to see dominos fall in projects and companies failing.  Read More: Voyager Seeks Bankruptcy Protection Amid Crypto Credit Crisis  Singapore-based Three Arrows Capital, a crypto-focused hedge fund, was ordered to liquidate after several weeks of difficulties. Ahead of the liquidation, crypto exchanges BlockFi and Voyager Digital took on huge lines of credit to help survive the crunch, as both had participated in financing Three Arrows. Their creditor, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, went on to say that he believes many crypto exchanges and firms are already “secretly insolvent.”  As it turns out, Voyager recently joined a series of crypto firms that have frozen activity, including withdrawals, amid the chilling of the digital asset space, and subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection.  These difficulties themselves followed an announcement by Coinbase (COIN) that investors at crypto brokerages don’t necessarily have the same liability protections and insurance they would at traditional brokerages or banks.  The advisor question  What’s an advisor to do? We’ve already written that clients want access to crypto and that advisors are gradually adopting digital asset investing and management into their practices. These trends are not easily reversed, no matter how much asset prices decline.  Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told an audience at Financial Advisor magazine’s recent Invest in Women conference in Atlanta to keep the faith.  “As an advisor, you don’t have to like crypto, but you want to help your clients manage it,” he said. In recent weeks, Edelman has noted that growing institutional involvement in crypto has it trading like a technology stock as they buy and sell in response to daily volatility.  Investors who want to benefit from crypto’s growth have to be able to hold on through the swings, said Edelman. If they wait until crypto is a “safe” investment, they end up missing the growth.  Read More: Despite Recent Bumps in the Road, Stablecoins Will Stick Around  I think advisors have a responsibility to help their clients who are already invested in crypto and those who are crypto-curious avoid losing their toes to frostbite in the crypto winter. Here are some ways they can help:  1. Stop the panic.  Digital assets are, for the time being, risk assets with greater volatility than other financial assets. A “crypto winter” was to be expected as the economy rarely goes for more than a decade without experiencing a recession.  As long as investors are well-diversified and prudently invested, they should be able to weather a downturn in crypto asset prices. Those with cash to spare and healthy risk appetites might even consider buying more while prices are low.  2. Know the risks and communicate them clearly.  Advisors are already comfortable discussing risk in equities, real estate and other assets – cryptocurrencies and digital assets should be treated no differently. A common practice is to prime clients for market volatility – and extra care should be taken to prime them for volatility in their crypto holdings.  Also, communicate to them some of the issues currently being worked out in crypto custody.  3. Lean on your knowledge of a client’s risk capacity and risk tolerance.  Some clients will require more hand-holding than others. Some clients may even be eager to invest more in crypto, while others might actually be better off lowering their allocations or divesting from the asset class due to their response to the current volatility. Don’t let these lessons go unlearned.  4. Wait for the dust to clear – or don’t.  Those more risk-tolerant clients may want to follow Warren Buffett’s advice to “buy when there’s blood in the streets.” They will need help allocating their assets appropriately. This is an opportunity to show value as an advisor, so do not shy away from helping them.  Will there be a spring?  I’m a writer, not a prognosticator. I don’t know how long this winter will last, or whether we’ll ever emerge. What I can say is that capital continues to be invested in crypto technology and infrastructure, and innovative new projects continue to be launched. The metaverse is under construction. Not only that, but the rails for institutional involvement in crypto and digital assets are still being built despite the downturn.  It seems to me that the smart money anticipates a “crypto spring” to come. Clients who are able to be patient and keep a level head will be the ones to reap the rewards of any rebound in the digital assets space.

Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Minister Sajid Javid were the first and most senior officials to resign on Tuesday, saying the public deserved a “government to be conducted properly,” and with “integrity.” About 60 members of government had quit by Thursday morning, Sky News reported.  On Wednesday, City Minister John Glen, who in April declared the U.K. ""open for crypto business,"" also quit. He pointed more explicitly to the handling of the Pincher’s appointment and Johnson’s ""poor judgment.” The government was also accused of throwing illegal parties during the COVID-19 lockdowns.  ""It is clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader of that party and therefore a new prime minister,"" Johnson said in a broadcast from outside his Downing Street home. ""As we've seen at Westminster, the herd instinct is powerful. When the herd moves, it moves. And, my friends, in politics no one is remotely indispensable.""  Johnson said he intends to stay as prime minister until a replacement is chosen. The timetable will be announced next week, he said.  The resignations are likely to lead to delays in crypto legislation. Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Wednesday that regulators’ plans for stablecoin legislation had already been delayed by the government disarray. In April, Glen and Sunak announced plans for crypto legislation packages, and the Treasury has since released a consultation on regulating systemic stablecoins.  Johnson became prime minister in 2019.  UPDATE (July 7, 11:47 UTC): Adds quote from Johnson.

Each software requires updates to keep them up to date with the changing dynamics and to enhance its offering. In the dictionary of Crypto, it is termed as &apos;forks&apos;. As you have heard already, Soft Fork and Hard Fork are two types of forks. If put in simple words, the only difference between the two forks is that Soft Fork also supports the prior version of the software whereas Hard Fork is a permanent alteration that is not compatible with the earlier version. What Is Fork And How Many Types Are There? The crypto community is one big family, and each member of the chain is known as a node. To co-exist, each node needs to align by a bunch of rules called &apos;protocols&apos;. The basic rules of the protocol are decided by its creator. The blockchain size, the mining rewards, etc., are selected for the community, and they all then work together. So, Fork is a sort of upgrade or update in the program code of the blockchain that modifies the working principle of the intact blockchain. Now, the question is what is Soft fork and Hard fork in blockchain? These are two types of Forks, one of which can be reversed, i.e. Soft Fork and the other is backward-incompatible, i.e. hard Fork.

The company also sold 637 BTC at an average price of $24,500 to pay for operating costs and a loan from Galaxy Digital, it said in a statement on Thursday.  Crypto miners have been selling bitcoin as their revenues have slumped along with the bear market. Argo said that it has been using derivatives to limit downside risk since the fourth quarter of last year and hired a full-time trader to improve its ""capabilities within risk and treasury management.""  As of the end of June, London-listed Argo had $22 million balance outstanding with Galaxy Digital, according to the statement. The firm signed the $30 million loan collateralized by bitcoin in December, according to its annual earnings report.  Argo's profit margin narrowed to 50% in June from 55% in May and 75% in April. The company has been hit by higher electricity costs at its Helios facility in Texas and the bitcoin (BTC) price drop. The miner revised its margin figure for May from 62% as it took into account newly received invoices.  Last month, Argo's revenue rose 10% to £3.38 million ($4.35 million) as it produced 46% more bitcoin than the previous month because of increased hashrate and uptime.  Argo is one of four companies that have ordered new crypto mining chips from Intel. The others are Hive Blockchain, Griid Infrastructure and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey's Block (formerly Square).  Intel has shipped its Blocksale chips, Raja Koduri, executive vice president and general manager of the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics at Intel, tweeted on June 29.

The ability to convert from ether to dollars is available to any developer building on Immutable. Developers can enable their users to sell layer 2-based ether and have the proceeds deposited directly into their bank accounts.  Decentralized layer 2 systems like Immutable X enable faster, cheaper and more energy-efficient transactions than the Ethereum mainnet. As per developer documents, Immutable can process more than 9,000 transactions per second (tps), while the Ethereum network averages 10.54 tps, as of Thursday morning.  This system appears to be one of the first instances of a layer 2, or subsidiary blockchain, application allowing users to directly withdraw ether holdings to U.S. dollars. The fiat transactions are processed via crypto payments firm MoonPay.  The withdrawal service is currently available only in the European Union, the U.K. and select U.S. states.  Immutable founder Robbie Ferguson told CoinDesk that the service comes at a time when the crypto community faces troubles with centralized crypto lenders.  “Centralized products failing over the past six months have made painstakingly clear the importance of decentralized ownership,” Ferguson said in a Twitter message. “Now anyone can take their ETH and receive USD in their bank accounts.”  Withdrawals on popular but centralized crypto-lending products, such as Celsius, remain paused on crypto market contagion risk in June stemming from the collapse of terraUSD (UST) in mid-May and crypto fund Three Arrows Capital in June.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/07/ethereum-scaling-solution-immutable-x-will-allow-ether-to-dollar-withdrawals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46fb6ab34ab4af1226bb59272caf74f10297c40b-4731x3548.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374313,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZAad,1657152000,Animoca Brands Leads $32M Funding Round for Planetarium Labs,"Planetarium Labs, which is building a community-driven Web3 game network, has raised $32 million in a Series A funding round led by Animoca Brands.  The investment will be used to help Planetarium Labs build out its network with tools for gaming and player governance, co-founder and CEO Kijun Seo told CoinDesk in an email.  Other investors in the round included Samsung Next and Planetarium partners Krust Universe, the investment arm of South Korean tech giant Kakao, and WeMade, the publisher of play-to-earn game Mir4.  The Planetarium Labs gaming system is based on Libplanet, a software development kit that lets developers create blockchain applications entirely on the Unity game development platform.  “Instead of multiple games sharing a single network, each game runs its application-specific blockchain network and has the freedom to design its governance and customize tokenomics, such as enabling free-to-play,” Seo said. “Afterwards, the players and the gaming community can operate a decentralized network powering each game.”  The Libplanet technology was used in the open-source online role-playing game Nine Chronicles, which has more than 300,000 users and backers that include Animoca Brands, Binance Labs and Ubisoft. Nine Chronicles will launch a ""Chapter 3"" update next week with a slate of new features, including dual staking programs and player championships, Seo said.  “Planetarium Labs is also supporting the development of live-action collectible NFT (non-fungible token) RPG Stella Fantasy, which had a major gameplay trailer reveal this week. We have recently signed a partnership with XL Games founded by Jake Song, the creator of the famed Lineage franchise and the co-founder of Nexon to explore community-governed MMORPGs,” Seo said, referring to ""massively multiplayer online role-playing games. He also noted that Planetarium will reveal more game titles under development through its partners later this quarter.  Hong Kong-based gaming investment firm Animoca Brands recently reported that its portfolio investments as of the end of April totaled more than $1.5 billion across 340 investments.  “We strongly believe that the future is massive decentralized worlds in an open metaverse, which is why we are delighted to support Planetarium Labs’ vision of community-centric blockchain games that empower players with creative freedom and full digital rights,” Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, said in a press release.
