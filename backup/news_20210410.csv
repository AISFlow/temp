42386443,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBT6e7,1618083071,Traders Opting for Cash and Carry Strategy as Bitcoin's 'Contango' Widens,"Savvy traders are locking returns of over 40% in the wake of bitcoin's widening contango – the spread between prices in futures and spot markets, also known as futures basis/premium.      ""With the premium on bitcoin futures expanding to as high as 40% per annum for the June expiry, there is a lot of interest from cash and carry traders to arbitrage the premium and lock-in risk-free gains,"" Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.      Cash and carry arbitrage is a market-neutral strategy aimed to profit from price discrepancies in one or more markets.      It involves buying an asset in the spot market against a short position in the futures market when the futures draw a significant premium relative to the spot price. That way, traders pocket a fixed return, as the premium decays over time and converges with the spot price on the expiry date.      According to data source Skew, bitcoin's June expiry futures listed on major exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, OKEx, BitMEX and Deribit are currently drawing an annualized premium of 44% to 48%. Meanwhile, those listed on the Delta Exchange are trading at a premium of 30%.      So, a carry trade taken now will yield an annualized return of 44% to 48% – a number significantly higher than interest rates on crypto deposits offered by lending platforms such as Genesis and BlockFi or government bond yields in emerging economies.      ""That's what we initiated today,"" Patrick Heusser, head of trading at the Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, said in a Telegram chat, adding that the widening of the basis indicates bitcoin's latest breakout above $60,000 is derivatives driven.      CoinDesk 20 data shows bitcoin broke out of a multi-week consolidation early Saturday with a sudden $3,000 rise to $61,065. Futures premium on major exchanges increased along with the spot market price, rising from roughly 32% to over 40%.      Some analysts are now eyeing the weekly close (Sunday, 23:59 UTC). ""BTC is back over $60,000! If we can close the week above here, then moon time,"" analyst Lark Davis tweeted early today.      However, market chatter shows growing concerns regarding the uptick in perpetual futures funding rate – the cost of holding long positions calculated and paid every eight hours. As such, the cryptocurrency may have a tough time securing a daily or weekly close above $60,000.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $59,700.

According to CoinDesk’s bitcoin price page, the leading cryptocurrency traded above $60,000 for the first time in nearly a month after spending weeks vacillating between $52,000 and the upper $50,000s. Bitcoin pulled back marginally after peaking around $60,900, though it remains above the psychological marker as of press time.      Bitcoin last hit an all-time high in mid-March, according to CoinGecko.      Meanwhile ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, came close to $2,200, just days after breaching $2,100 for the first time.      While it’s unclear if there’s causation, the price action comes just days before leading U.S. exchange Coinbase begins trading on Nasdaq in one of the crypto industry’s most anticipated events. A sign of the maturing market, the listing will likely give Wall Street traders their most accessible bet yet on growth in the space.      Some institutional investors have wasted little time. On Friday Daniel Loeb, CEO of $17 billion hedge fund Third Point revealed he was a hodler in response to a CoinDesk report. He’s hardly alone: Institutional funds have flooded the markets and have been deemed at least partly responsible for the 2020-2021 rally.      Bitcoin bulls were further bolstered on Friday by the idea that an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with exposure to the digital asset space might be approved in 2021, after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed it is reviewing ETF giant WisdomTree’s application.      The regulator previously began reviewing VanEck’s ETF application last month, and another six companies have filed initial registration forms declaring their own efforts to launch a regulated bitcoin investment vehicle.      The broader digital asset space has seen tremendous froth over the past few months, with investors and industry participants trading heavily in decentralized finance tools, non-fungible tokens and altcoins like doge, which hit a peak of $0.08 in February, eight times its value a month earlier.
