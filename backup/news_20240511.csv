27676054,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607567,1715464851,"Cardano Ready For 15x Move, Crypto Analyst Reveals The Major Drivers","Cardano (ADA) looks primed to make that move to the upside, with crypto analyst Javon Marks revealing what could make the crypto token see a 15x increase in its price. Marks’ analysis comes amidst recent price predictions, which paint a bullish outlook for Cardano. How Cardano Could See A 15x Increase In Its Price Marks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that ADA has shown “major progress since breaking the resisting trend.” The crypto analyst also noted that the crypto token attempted to move over 200% toward the first target at $2.77709 and claimed that the recent pullback Cardano faced could strengthen it to achieve an even more parabolic rise. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Term NUPL Value Turns Negative, What This Means For Price Source: X This development is why Marks believes Cardano could rise to as high as $7.80 from its current price, representing a 1,500% increase for the crypto token. A rise to that level looks more feasible, considering that crypto analyst Altcoin Daily also recently predicted that Cardano will rise to $9 in this bull run. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez made an ultra-bullish case for Cardano, noting that the crypto token was currently mirroring its price action from 2019, when it made a price gain of over 4,000%. While Martinez acknowledged that history might not repeat itself, he suggested that Cardano could still make an impressive move similar to 2019. For Cardano to experience such parabolic moves, the crypto token needs to see a reversal in its current downtrend. Crypto analyst Trend Rider hinted that could happen soon, noting that ADA was still holding its support level. According to him, if Cardano can hold on to this support for 1 to 2 weeks, the bears will tire, and the crypto token will bounce from its current price level. Analyzing Cardano’s Bull Run Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, again suggested that Cardano’s price action in this bull run will likely mirror Ethereum’s in the last bull run. He noted that the former is currently around the level that Ethereum was at around the 2020 Bitcoin halving. As such, he expects Cardano to enjoy a similar success to the one Ethereum enjoyed in the last bull run. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Can Break Out From Falling Pennant, But Can It Reach $1? The crypto analyst also assured that Cardano was still on track for its bull run, stating that it was also down over 90% from its all-time high (ATH) months after Bitcoin halved in the last bull run. As such, he still expects Cardano to make a run soon enough, just like it did in 2021. The crypto analyst hinted that Cardano’s bull run would likely begin during the Altcoin Season. However, he wasn’t sure when this Altcoin season would likely start since Bitcoin hit a new ATH before the halving (which has never happened before). He added that this Altcoin season might not come until December. For now, the analyst noted that patience is the name of the game.

The whimsical cryptocurrency, a playful misspelling of President Joe Biden’s name, experienced a huge increase after Trump mentioned it at an NFT event in Florida. What was once a subject of amusement has now become a serious investment, as Boden surged 20% following Trump’s offhand remark. Related Reading: $20 On The Horizon For XRP? Unpacking A Potential 650x Surge And What It Means Trump Rally Or Fleeting Frenzy? Analysts Divided The cryptocurrency community has been divided over the impact of Trump’s mention of Boden. Some analysts, such as Samantha Wilkins, believe that any mention from a prominent figure like Trump is positive for the memecoin. They contend that Boden has shown to be a tenacious and astute investment, and that the excitement around it has only grown as a result of Trump’s remark. Trump Speaks on $BODEN at NFT Event “That’s a Lotta Money for a Coin, I Don’t Like That Investment” Audio Source: @realDannyNelson pic.twitter.com/8NcpuCc6ZI — db (@tier10k) May 9, 2024 However, some experts remain skeptical. They caution that Boden’s value is built on hype rather than utility, making it susceptible to swift market shifts. A single negative tweet from Trump or a change in market sentiment could cause Boden to come crashing down as quickly as it rose. Will Trump Re-Boden The Market? Adding another layer of intrigue to the Boden saga, the prediction platform Polymarket has created a contract speculating on the likelihood of Trump mentioning the memecoin again before July. Currently, the contract’s “yes” shares are trading at $0.05, indicating an 11% chance that Trump will utter the word “Boden” in the coming months. Source: Polymarket This unique situation presents an unusual scenario where the value of a memecoin hinges on the whims of a former president. If Trump revisits Boden in a future speech or tweet, it could trigger another surge in price. However, if he remains silent, the current hype surrounding Boden may fizzle out, leaving investors holding a depreciating digital punchline. Jeo Boden is currently trading at $0.2799. Chart: TradingView Boden: A Gamble On Speculation The rise of Boden serves as a cautionary tale for memecoin enthusiasts. While these tokens can offer explosive returns, their value is often tied to fleeting trends and external factors beyond their control. With the enigmatic Trump as a wildcard influence, the future of Boden remains uncertain. Related Reading: XRP All Talk, No Action?

The tech entrepreneur is a familiar figure in the crypto space and is known to be heavily invested in the flagship crypto. When Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million In an interview with Pirate Wires, Dorsey mentioned that BTC could hit $1 million in 2030 and beyond. In addition to predicting Bitcoin’s future trajectory, Dorsey took time to appreciate the Bitcoin ecosystem. He remarked that besides its history, “the most amazing thing about Bitcoin” is how those who work on it, earn from it or invest in it all contribute to making the ecosystem, which in turn causes Bitcoin’s price to go up. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Moves 1,000 ETH – Is The Top In? Dorsey further claimed that Bitcoin is a “fascinating ecosystem and movement” and that he has learned a lot from it. Based on his assertion, the tech entrepreneur is undoubtedly one of those contributing to the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Dorsey and his digital payments company, Block, already hold over 8,000 BTC. His company also recently announced plans to begin investing 10% of its monthly Bitcoin-related gross profits in buying more BTC. This investment plan could lead to the company investing as much as $24 million in BTC one year from now. It is also worth mentioning that Dorsey has been actively looking to build in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It was previously reported that the former Twitter CEO was planning on building a decentralized exchange (DEX) for Bitcoin. More recently, Dorsey’s Block announced that they had completed a BTC mining system they had been working on since April 2023. BTC Hitting $1 Million Could Be This Year The CEO of Jan3 and Bitcoiner Samson Mow shares a contrary opinion with Dorsey. He predicted before now that Bitcoin could reach $1 million before the end of this year. Mow alluded to the increasing demand for Bitcoin as why he holds such a belief. The crypto founder suggested that this prediction would likely be attained next year if it didn’t happen this year. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sets $10 Price Target For Cardano As Volume Jumps 90% Crypto analyst PlanB also believes that next year is a more feasible timeline for BTC to reach this price level. He stated that $1 million could be the market top for BTC in this bull run based on the Bitcoin stock-to-flow (STF) indicator, which hinted at $500,000 being the average price for BTC in this market cycle. Other crypto analysts have given more conservative price predictions for this bull run. CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju recently predicted that BTC could hit $265,000. Meanwhile, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, predicted that BTC could peak at $170,000 in this market cycle.

42418268,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd1lV,1715443200,Trump’s Pro-Crypto Bluster at NFT Gala Lacked Policy Substance,"PALM BEACH, FL. — During his first stint in the White House Donald Trump was no fan of cryptocurrencies; he once tweeted they were ""based on thin air."" He later sold millions of dollars worth of NFTs. This week, he rebranded himself as crypto's candidate of choice.  ""If you’re in favor of crypto you’re gonna vote for Trump because they want to end it,"" he said at a Wednesday night party in Mar-a-Lago, referring to Democrats and President Joe Biden. He also vowed to make sure his campaign can accept crypto donations.  The 77-year-old candidate's apparent turnabout came as little surprise to his audience of some 200 supporters. Many had bought $10,000 of Trump Trading Card NFTs to join this surreal, sweltering outdoor reception at the former President's Floridian palace. A CoinDesk reporter also attended (as a +1).  For nearly an hour, Trump fielded questions from a sea of sweat-drenched suit-wearers. Only a handful of them focused on crypto, an incredibly niche wedge issue that was the nominal anchor of the entire event.  But it was enough to make a few things clear:  Trump is no expert on cryptocurrencies.  Trump is an expert at selling cryptocurrencies.  The first two points don't matter because Trump has declared himself the champion of cryptocurrencies.  One exchange highlights points 1 and 3 (we will return to 2 later). When asked how he felt about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and ""government blockchains"" (two things that crypto proponents generally oppose) Trump responded ""I think it all has its place.""  He continued:  ""We have some incredible things happening, I mean crypto, if you go back to crypto a couple years ago, people said it wasn’t gonna make it but now it's up in record numbers. I guess you could say it's a form of currency and I think I’m for that, more and more I’m for that.""  The substance of Trump's support for crypto might be less important to the industry's (likely small) cadre of single-issue voters than the fact he's saying anything positive about it. Trump appears to be the first major party presidential candidate that's embraced crypto.  Blasting Biden  On the other side of the race is an openly hostile presidential administration. Joe Biden's SEC chairman Gary Gensler is waging lawfare against many parts of the crypto industry. And earlier Wednesday, hours before his opponent's golf-resort gala, the President vowed to block a House effort to dismantle an SEC accounting rule for crypto that political opponents argue has hampered the industry's growth.  ""Biden doesn’t even know what it is. If you ask Biden, 'Sir, are you for or against crypto?' he’ll say, 'What’s that? Get me off the stage.' He has no idea,"" Trump said. Whether or not that somewhat plausible presumption is true, Trump followed up with an attack on Gensler, an official well-versed in crypto.  ""I’ll say this: I’m fine with it, I want to make sure it's good and solid and everything else but I’m good with it,"" Trump said of crypto. He later said, ""If we’re gonna have what we have then we’re going to have to embrace a lot of things that not everybody likes.""  Hours before Trump's impromptu Q&A, the Biden campaign team roasted ""people suckered into paying as much as $10,000 for simple digital images of him"" in an email to supporters. The email blasted Trump for holding a glitzy NFT dinner instead of campaigning during his midweek break from court.  But Trump was campaigning on Wednesday night. He was vying for votes from the exceptionally loud crypto crowd that Biden had thoroughly snubbed. Sure, only a few hundred heard him firsthand. Their videos of Trump's pro-crypto musings ricocheted across social media and triggered a torrent of media coverage for crypto's self-appointed political champion.  ""There's 50 million crypto holders in the U.S. That's a lot of voters,"" Ryan Selkis, the CEO of crypto data platform Messari claimed to Mar-a-Lago's packed ballroom where VIPs (those who bought $10,000 of NFTs ) mingled with dinner attendees (who paid $4,700). Trump had unexpectedly called Selkis onstage.  The soundbites that emerged from Wednesday's NFT gala may accelerate crypto's polarization by locking it in the same us-or-them shackles that bind much of American politics. Bitcoin's libertarian roots hardly resonate today; crypto has its proponents on both sides of the aisle.  Republican politics' most powerful voice cast crypto's bipartisan reality aside in declaring Democrats want to kill it off. ""The Democrats are very much against it,"" Trump said, hours after 21 of the House's 213 Democrats voted to repeal the SEC accounting rule.  Trump framed himself as the industry's only hope. His fluency in the industry's issues was spotty. Asked how he would change hostile U.S. policies that drive crypto businesses out of the country, he said: ""We'll stop it, because I don't want that, I don't want that. I want that – if we're going to embrace it then we have to let them be here.""  'We Made NFTs Hot Again'  There was one area of crypto where Trump spoke more-or-less expertly: his NFTs. Three collections of Trump NFTs – digital trading cards that depict an uber-jacked Donald in various states of patriotism – have generated millions of dollars in sales. Wednesday's dinner gala celebrated high-rollers who bought into his ""Mugshot Edition"" third collection.  ""We did it when NFTs were not hot and we made NFTs hot again,"" Trump claimed of his cards, adding that some NFT buyers made tens of thousands of dollars on the resale market.  Asked by one attendee if he would sell a fourth NFT collection, the longtime businessman demurred. ""I believe in supply and demand. And as you know 1 did great, 2 did great, 3 did great. At some point maybe that turns around.""  He polled the audience: How many Mugshot high-rollers wanted a series 4 collection of NFTs? Most raised their hands. Trump sounded bewildered: ""Based on supply and demand, wouldn’t that maybe keep your prices, of the stuff you already bought, wouldn't that keep it lower?"" He tested their resolve. ""Who would like not to see a fourth collection for that reason?"" Only a couple of hands shot up.  ""Ok, a couple of economists,"" Trump said to the laughter of the crowd.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/11/trumps-pro-crypto-bluster-at-nft-gala-lacked-policy-substance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d990dfa84b6ba4b5c2746d4de9e28590de8f9a5c-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

27676050,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607543,1715436046,Unlocking The Dogecoin Code: One Factor Holds The Key To Its Next Ascent,"Dogecoin, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency that took the internet by storm in 2021, has seen a recent uptick in price. However, experts are cautioning investors against mistaking this blip for the start of a moon mission. Related Reading: $20 On The Horizon For XRP? Unpacking A Potential 650x Surge And What It Means DOGE Price Volatility Takes A Vacation One factor tempering enthusiasm is Dogecoin’s current lack of volatility. While price swings are often a hallmark of the cryptocurrency market, DOGE’s volatility has hit a 30-day low. This calmness suggests the recent price increase might not translate into a sustained upward trend. Memecoins like Dogecoin thrive on volatility, and the current lull suggests a period of price stability, which isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s unlikely to trigger the explosive rallies we’ve seen in the past. Source: IntoTheBlock Dogecoin Network Activity: Apathy Or Accumulation? Another dampener on the celebratory champagne showers is the low user activity on the Dogecoin network. The number of active addresses, which indicates user engagement, is currently hovering around 52,000. This is a significant drop compared to March 2024, when a surge in active addresses coincided with a price jump to $0.22. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.18 trillion. Chart: TradingView Historically, spikes in Dogecoin’s user activity have foreshadowed price increases. The current low suggests a lack of excitement or, perhaps, a period of accumulation by investors who are waiting for the right moment to jump in. DOGE Stuck In Consolidation: A Sideways Serenade Or Coiling For A Leap? For the past few weeks, Dogecoin’s price has been stuck in a consolidation phase, oscillating between $0.14 and $0.16. This sideways movement, while frustrating for those hoping for a quick return, could be a sign of a different kind of preparation. Doge price action in the last 24 hours. Source: Coingecko Consolidation periods often precede significant breakouts. While it doesn’t guarantee a future surge, it suggests the price is finding support and could be coiling for a potential leap. Related Reading: XRP All Talk, No Action? Social Media Booms, But Price Stuck In The Bear Pit A Glimmer Of Hope: MVRV Z Score Hints At Undervaluation A beacon of optimism comes from the MVRV Z Score, an indicator that suggests Dogecoin might be currently undervalued. This metric essentially compares the market value of a coin to its historical value. A score below a certain threshold suggests the coin might be undervalued and has room for growth. A Slow Burn Or A Surprise Spark? The current data paints a picture of a cautious future for Dogecoin’s price. While a major rally seems unlikely in the immediate future, there are underlying hints that suggest potential for growth. The low volatility and user activity could be signs of consolidation and accumulation, respectively, both of which could precede a future price increase.

27676049,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607540,1715428805,Avalanche (AVAX) Price Dips As Market Turbulence Persists,"AVAX is the native utility token of the Avalanche blockchain. The token is currently ranked 12th by market cap, with a total supply of 440,043,419 AVAX and a total trading volume of over $396,250,098 in the last 24 hours. Since its recent pullback at $36.15, AVAX has continued to move downward. Currently, the general cryptocurrency market is bearish. This has led to the price of AVAX dropping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the price might continue to drop in the next couple of days. As of the time of writing, the price of AVAX was trading around $33.52 and about 0.22% down in the last 24 hours. Technical Indicators Point Toward A Sustained Downtrend For AVAX To figure out where the AVAX price might be headed next, the following indicators can be used to examine the chart. 4-Day MACD: A technical look at the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, the MACD histograms are trending below the zero line, and both the MACD line and the Signal line crossed each other while trending below the MACD zero line, indicating a continuous movement on the downside. This can be seen in the below image. 4-Day RSI: The formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the above image also suggests a downward continuation movement as the RSI signal line is seen to have moved above the 50% level and then dropped below it. This suggests that sellers are still very much active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of buyers. Alligator Indicator: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that AVAX is trading below the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw. It can also be seen that the price tried to move above the alligator lines but failed to do so, suggesting that the price might continue to move in its downward direction. The Coin Could Form A New Low Conclusively, from the previous downward movement, AVAX has formed two resistance levels of $39.94 and $36.15 and a support level of $30.34. Currently, AVAX is moving toward this support level and if it breaks above this level, the price might drop even further to create a new low. On the contrary, if the price fails to break above this support, it will reverse and start an upward movement toward its previous resistance level of $36.15. Should AVAX manage to break above this resistance level, the price might move further to test the $39.94 resistance level.

Avoiding the big visions and interesting websites typical of meme coins, WIF chooses its straightforward identity, billing itself as “literally just a dog wif a hat.” Despite its simple concept and lack of innovative features, WIF has defied expectations. Starting at just 7 cents early in 2024, the token quickly picked up steam. By February’s end, it broke the $1 mark, and by the end of March, it peaked at $4.85—an astonishing 7,000% increase in under three months. WIF’s market cap followed this path, hitting over $1 billion by mid-March and reaching a peak of $4.75 billion. This phenomenal growth turned what began as a playful meme into one of the crypto market’s major players by 2024. Final Thoughts The market has finally emerged from the red, with many popular altcoins gradually recovering their losses. Now, with another bull run on the horizon, investors are seeking the next meme coin poised to skyrocket and deliver significant profits. Many industry experts suggest that these five meme coins are prime candidates for investment in May 2024. Given that most of these tokens are still in the presale phase, there remains an opportunity to secure them at reasonable prices before they explode.",POSITIVE,WIF,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | WIF,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/all/the-best-meme-coin-presales-of-may-2024/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

With the crypto market leader now in a consolidation phase, a trading analyst with X username Titan of Crypto has expressed resilient faith in Bitcoin’s ability to produce a post-halving price rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Down 20% From March But Glassnode Analysts Are Very Bullish: Here’s Why Bitcoin Rise Inevitable, Analyst Pinpoints $150,000 Price Target In a series of X posts on Friday, Titan of Crypto shared some interesting bullish predictions on the Bitcoin market. Firstly, the analyst noted that amidst BTC’s price decline, the token’s price pattern on the daily timeframe had formed a bullish signal. Titan of Crypto referred to this signal as the bullish engulfing candle which occurs when a larger bullish candle completely emerges from the previous smaller bearish candle, thus indicating a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. Following these observations, the analyst also predicted Bitcoin to soon experience a massive post-halving price gain. Titan of Crypto described this forecast as “inevitable” citing data from Bitcoin’s price history. The crypto analyst said: To understand the present you have to search in the past. And what the past is telling us is there is no occurrence of #BTC not having a rally after the halving. Titan of Crypto also acknowledged that short-term price movements may be “confusing” however he expects BTC to maintain an upward trajectory in the long room. Based on previous post-halving rallies, Titan of Crypto predicts Bitcoin to trade at $150,000 in 2025.

Interestingly, this prediction by Santiment is based on a decline in the dip-buying activity of Bitcoin investors. The analytics platform reports that the trading interest in Bitcoin following its most recent decline on Friday is far below levels associated with previous price falls.

Analyst Identifies Pivotal Summer For VeChain With This Bullish Fractal,"Over the past few weeks, the price of VeChain (VET) has struggled to live up to the promise and vigor it showed at the start of the year. This has been the story with a significant portion of the cryptocurrency market, with several large-cap altcoins down by double-digits in the past month. However, the VeChain token has been a hot subject of discussion in the circle of cryptocurrency analysts and pundits. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez is amongst the latest to put forward future projections for the token. Can VeChain Price Reach $0.6 By December 2024? The crypto pundit took to the X platform to share an interesting update on the monthly chart of the VET price. According to Martinez, the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a price rebound this summer, which might be crucial to its performance in the rest of the year. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Can Break Out From Falling Pennant, But Can It Reach $1? This projection is based on the return of a previously identified consolidation range in the VeChain price, with the analyst suggesting that the token could follow this historical fractal. Martinez pointed out that the fractal appeared in 2020 when VET’s price reached its all-time high of $0.281. Most recently, VET broke out of a consolidation range following its significant price surge to $0.04664 in February. The altcoin has been experiencing a price correction since then, although what looks like a “resistance retest” seems to be complete. According to Martinez, the price of VeChain is set for a “rebound” this summer after retesting the channel’s upper boundary at around $0.32. Following the price recovery, the analyst said the cryptocurrency is likely to experience a “potential explosive growth” in the fall. A monthly price chart of VET showing the fractals | Source: Ali_Charts/X As highlighted in the chart above, VET’s price could travel as high as $0.6 by December 2024. If this fractal does play out as the analyst anticipates, the price target would be a new all-time high and a massive 1,600% surge from the current price point. VET Price Overview As of this writing, the VeChain token is valued at $0.03469, reflecting a 2.6% price dip in the last 24 hours. VET’s struggles in the past day underscore the altcoin’s sluggish performance on even broader timeframes.

27630057,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607512,1715392837,The Akash Network Phenomenon: Breaking Down Its 2400% Uptrend And Market Outperformance,"Decentralized and open-source computing platform Akash Network has captured significant attention in the cryptocurrency market as its native token, AKT, has outperformed the top 100 cryptocurrencies with a 2400% price increase year-to-date. While Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies experience price corrections, the Akash Network and its native token are surging at a remarkable pace. To comprehend the driving factors behind this uptrend, it is crucial to delve deeper into what the Akash Network represents and its underlying technology. What Is The Akash Network? The Akash Network, founded in March 2018 by Overclock Labs, emerged as a distributed cloud computing marketplace with the objective of decentralizing cloud computing. Originally focused on building a traditional multi-cloud deployment platform, Overclock Labs decided to launch Akash. According to Messari, the network facilitates the connection between server owners in need of computing power to host applications and users offering cloud computing resources through the Akash Marketplace, where computing resources are bought and sold. At the core of the Akash Network lies its blockchain infrastructure known as Akash, built using the Cosmos SDK and based on the Tendermint consensus mechanism. Related Reading: XRP All Talk, No Action? Social Media Booms, But Price Stuck In The Bear Pit Since the launch of Akash Mainnet in September 2020, the network has undergone notable upgrades to increase its functionality. These upgrades include the introduction of the Akash Marketplace, flexible bid pricing, Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) compatibility, deployment tools for improved user experience, audited attributes, and Tendermint’s State Sync. Subsequent upgrades introduced features such as persistent storage, authorized spending, an inflation decay curve, fractional uAKT to eliminate minimum cost deployment, IP leases, provider service splits, Cosmos IBC3 update, and Interchain Accounts (ICA). Messari points out that the most recent upgrades have positioned Akash as a prominent player in the cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) development space. Mainnet 6 introduced support for GPUs and stable payments, establishing Akash as an open-source marketplace for high-density GPUs and a distributed cloud for large language models (LLM). In conjunction with this upgrade, Overclock Labs launched Akash ML, a cloud infrastructure that offers AI developers GPU spot instances, with plans to provide on-demand access in the future. Subsequent upgrades focused on enforcing minimum validator commissions, improving GPU visibility, and ensuring validated bids on multi-service deployments. AKT Token Breaks Key Trendline In terms of price action, the Akash Network’s native token, AKT, has recently demonstrated a notable breakthrough. Over the past 24 hours, AKT has experienced a significant surge of 15.63%, propelling its trading value to $5.64. One key indicator of this positive development is the token’s ability to surpass a diagonal trendline in the 4-hour timeframe. Breaking this trendline suggests a potential reversal of the previous downward trajectory and opens up the possibility of further bullish market sentiment for AKT. Moving forward, the focus for AKT is to sustain the previous week’s high of $5.095 as a crucial level of support. By maintaining this level, the token aims to consolidate its recent gains and solidify its position in the market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Can Break Out From Falling Pennant, But Can It Reach $1? In summary, the price increase of AKT can be attributed to several factors. The success of the Akash Network’s underlying technology and its value proposition in the decentralized cloud computing space contribute to the positive sentiment surrounding the token. As the network gains recognition and attracts users, demand for AKT may increase, resulting in upward pressure on the price. In addition, the successful break of the diagonal trend line represents a potential shift in market dynamics as investors may take this as a bullish signal, leading to increased buying activity and further price appreciation.

So far, BTC has support at around $60,000, but a key reaction level to watch is $56,500 on the lower side. On the flip side, if prices recover, breaking above $66,000, BTC might rally, even breaching $72,000 and later $74,000. However, for bulls to find support and prices to rally, triggers would be from fundamental factors. Though price action structure might offer support, price catalysts are, as history shows, related to market events. As Glassnode observes, the robust macro trend, bullish for Bitcoin, has tapered volatility, helping maintain the uptrend. The increasingly shallow corrections, as the blockchain analytics platform notes, point to a more mature market backed by more institutions. Whales Accumulating As Institutions Eye BTC Confidence remains high. On-chain data reveals that one whale has taken advantage of the relatively low prices and the correction to stack coins. In the last week, the whale bought over 100 BTC, pushing the amount of coins bought this month to over 7,257 BTC. This aggressive accumulation suggests that the whale, even at the current multi-year high, Bitcoin could be undervalued. There could be more Bitcoin tailwinds incoming. For instance, this week, former United States president Donald Trump started accepting crypto donations in the ongoing campaign. This shift of stance has been bullish since Trump dismissed Bitcoin earlier. While this happens, European regulators appear open to approving Bitcoin as an investable asset within Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) funds. If this goes through, it could unlock more billions into Bitcoin from European institutions. This move is massive, considering that banking giants like Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas are already exploring ways for their clients to invest in BTC.

27607283,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607508,1715385601,"EigenLayer Launches Airdrop Season, Allowing Users To Claim 113M EIGEN Tokens","Restaking protocol EigenLayer has unveiled its highly anticipated airdrop season, during which eligible users can claim a portion of the initial EIGEN token supply. EigenLayer Sets September 2024 Deadline The protocol’s announcement on Friday revealed that “Season 1” commences with 6.05% of the total supply, which users can claim starting on May 10. Moreover, “Season 1 phase 2,” set to begin mid-June, will increase the claimable percentage to 6.75%. Season 1 will distribute approximately 113 million EIGEN tokens to participants. EigenLayer has reserved 15% of the initial token supply for the community across all seasons, signaling its commitment to inclusive participation. Related Reading: XRP All Talk, No Action? Social Media Booms, But Price Stuck In The Bear Pit EigenLayer has also announced that EIGEN tokens are currently non-transferable. However, the protocol plans to unlock token transfers once new features are launched and “further decentralization” is achieved. These developments are expected to take place by September 30th, 2024. Until transfer restrictions are removed, core contributors and investors will not receive EIGEN staking rewards, and no inflation will occur. Record-Breaking $14 Billion In Assets Since its soft launch in 2023, EigenLayer has reportedly attracted $14 billion in assets, making it a prominent player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. According to Bloomberg, the protocol’s restaking service offers amplified returns by leveraging the process of depositing ETH coins to support the Ethereum blockchain. Eigen Labs, the Seattle-based firm behind EigenLayer, raised approximately $165 million from notable backers, including a16z Crypto. Investors gain access to EigenDA by staking EIGEN, a performance data availability system supporting Ethereum rollups. The protocol claims this presents an opportunity for users to secure amplified returns. Additionally, EigenLayer will shortly introduce compatibility with various AVSs (Application-Specific Verification Systems), offering stakers more options. Nonetheless, virtual private network users and residents of countries such as the US, Canada, and China have been excluded from the airdrop, highlighting the challenges of operating within regulatory frameworks and ensuring compliance. Eigen Foundation’s executive director, Robert Drost, acknowledged the complexities of navigating regulatory guidelines: It’s not possible to operate in the space without following regulatory guidelines and being responsible, and the challenging part is that there is not a lot of clarity. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sets $10 Price Target For Cardano As Volume Jumps 90% Despite these setbacks, EigenLayer’s popularity has positioned it as the second most popular DeFi application, surpassing liquid staking platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool. While liquid staking provides easier access to staking rewards and leads the DeFi category, it has experienced significant outflows in recent months. DefiLlama data indicates a 27% decline in total value locked in liquid staking protocols since their peak of $63 billion in March. EigenLayer’s restaking service has contributed to the restaking of nearly 4% of all ETH. The second largest cryptocurrency on the market, Ethereum, is trading at $2,890, following Bitcoin’s lead with a 3.8% drop in the past 24 hours.
