42381360,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95LSd,1543593652,Bitcoin ETF Seekers Met With SEC Monday In Latest Pitch for Approval,"Members of VanEck, SolidX and the Cboe BZX Exchange met with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff earlier this week to present a new argument on why the bitcoin market is ready for an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  In the latest push to convince the regulator to approve a rule change which would open the door for the country's first bitcoin ETF, the three firms met with the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance, Division of Trading and Markets, Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and Office of General Counsel.  Notably, Monday's effort differed from previous presentations, which took more of a regulatory focus.  Instead, the proponents' argument centered around the idea that the bitcoin market is mature enough to support an ETF, and at present looks similar to markets for other assets which already have such products. The presentation gave several examples of assets that already have ETFs, including crude oil, silver and gold.  The presentation specifically tied the idea of futures markets with spot markets, noting that for money substitutes such as gold and silver, this connection between the two can be proven with empirical evidence. Further, this type of price co-integration ""is evidence of a well-functioning capital market.""  The firms went on to explain that ""Similar to commodity futures, the spot and futures prices [of bitcoin] are tightly linked,"" again providing ""evidence of a well-functioning capital market.""  On another note, they argued that the bitcoin ecosystem is ""less susceptible to manipulation"" than other commodities which already support exchange-traded products.  For example, insiders might possess or trade information related to the supply of physical commodities – say, if a new source for an asset is discovered, or if some event lowers the production – and this may impact price.  Bitcoin does not face this sort of issue, the presentation notes, adding:  ""The linkage between the bitcoin markets and the presence of arbitrageurs in those markets means that the manipulation of the price of bitcoin on any single venue would require manipulation of the global bitcoin price in order to be effective ... Bitcoin therefore is no more susceptible to manipulation than other commodities, especially as compared to other approved ETP reference assets.""  Any attempt to manipulate bitcoin's price ""would require overcoming the liquidity supply of such arbitrageurs who are effectively eliminating any cross-market pricing differences,"" especially as these arbitrageurs are likely to have their funds stored on different exchanges to take advantage of price differences.  The applicants' pitch came a day before SEC chairman Jay Clayton said concerns about market manipulation are one of the barriers preventing an ETF approval.  Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest conference a day after the presentation, Clayton explained that ""the prices retail investors are seeing are the prices they should rely on, and free from manipulation.""  Outside the market itself, the ETF's proponents highlighted Cboe's matching engine and VanEck's MVIS Bitcoin OTC Index as further benefits on Monday.  In particular, MVIS' other indices are designed specifically for use with an ETP. The VanEck subsidiary already offers 88 indices on different asset classes, passively managing some $15 billion-worth. The company is also in compliance with the EU's benchmark regulation, they added.

42381352,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95LNb,1543590016,"New Crypto Mining Malware Seen to 'Evolve,' Say Researchers","Researchers at Israel-based cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies say that a relatively new form of crypto mining malware, dubbed KingMiner, is “evolving.”  In a research note on Thursday, the firm's Ido Solomon and Adi Ikan said that KingMiner, a monero mining malware that first appeared about six months ago, is changing through time to avoid detection – even replacing older versions of itself that it encounters on host machines.  The researchers said:  “The malware continuously adds new features and bypass methods to avoid emulation. Mainly, it manipulates the needed files and creates a dependency which is critical during emulation.”  As a result of these tactics, the malware is also being detected by security systems at ""significantly"" reduced rates.  The malware usually targets Microsoft servers (predominantly IIS\SQL) and while configured to harness 75 percent of the victim machine's CPU capacity for mining, it actually uses up the full 100 percent.  To preserve its secrecy, KingMiner is also seen to use a private mining pool to avoid detection, which also has its API switched off.  ""We have not yet determined which domains are used, as this is also private.

The firm announced Friday that the new Bitmain Crypto Index tracks the performance of some of the ""largest and most liquid"" cryptocurrencies, and is denominated in U.S. dollars.  The index publishes two types of prices, a real-time spot price that is updated every second, and a daily reference price that is published once a day around 10:00 a.m. Hong Kong time.  It further lists spot prices on 17 top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, as well as a combined Bitmain Big 10 Index (BLC10) based on 10 large-cap cryptos. The Big 10 is weighted by market cap and its member cryptos represent more than 90 percent of the wider market's value, says Bitmain  ""The index is developed to provide institutional and retail investors with transparent, timely, methodology-based, and investable benchmark of the most active cryptocurrencies traded globally,"" Bitmain explained in its index methodology.  Price data is sourced from a number of exchanges, including Bitfinex, Binance, Bitstamp, Bittrex, GDAX, Gemini, Huobi, Itbit, Kraken, OKEX, and Poloniex. The exchanges are selected based on various factors, Bitmain said, such as reputation, price transparency, compliance level, stability and trading volume.  Should one of the listed tokens undergo a hard fork split, as bitcoin cash recently did, Bitmain said, “a hard forked new token will be measured against a set of criteria on its 10th day post-fork to determine whether it is a significant one” to add.  The index will be reviewed monthly by a committee set up by the firm.

42381376,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95LkF,1543578323,Capitulation? Bitcoin's Price Dropped 36% in November,"Bitcoin (BTC) tanked in November on the back of high volumes, raising the possibility that the market has, to some extent, capitulated.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $4,000 – down 36 percent from its monthly opening price of $6,318 – according to CoinMarketCap data. That drop marks the biggest monthly loss of the year so far.  Amid the losses, trading volumes jumped by 33 percent month-on-month to $158.48 billion – the highest level since May.  It is worth noting that, at the start of the month, BTC was already down close to 70 percent from the record high of almost $20,000 reached in December 2017. So, November’s losses essentially mark an extension of the bear market (which had supposedly bottomed out near $6,000) with a high-volume drop to 14-month lows below $3,500.  But BTC’s failure to produce a meaningful bounce despite the repeated defense of the 21-month EMA in five months to October might have left investors disappointed, resulting in the increased sell-off as they left the market. Amid these signs of capitulation, it is still too early to call a long-term bottom.  In the last few days, however, prices have recovered from lows below $3,500 – possibly just bargain hunting after the sell-off, but potentially the start of a corrective rally, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) was reporting record oversold conditions a few days ago.  Monthly chart  On the monthly chart, BTC is set to close below the former support (now resistance) of the 21-month EMA for the first time since October 2015.  A long-term bullish reversal would only be confirmed if and when prices clear the EMA, currently lined up at $5,977.  4-hour chart  On the 4-hour chart, BTC has fallen back below the double top neckline support at $4,120, having faced rejection at the falling trendline. As a result, the immediate bullish outlook has been neutralized.  The recent low of $3,474 could come into play if the immediate support at $3,771 (low of Wednesday's bullish reversal candle) is breached.  A break above the falling trendline, if confirmed, would bolster the already bullish technical setup and could yield a stronger rally toward $5,000.  View  The bitcoin market is likely showing signs of capitulation.  A break below the neckline support of $4,120 has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook put forward by the double bottom breakout yesterday.  A move below $3,771 (Wednesday's low) would invalidate the bullish setup on the daily chart and allow re-test of the recent low of $3,474.  A break above $4,250 (falling trendline resistance) would open up upside towards $4,761 (resistance as per the 4-hour chart).

42429969,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mDh,1543572044,Asus Allows Gamers to Mine Crypto With Their Idle Graphics Cards,"Taiwan-based tech giant Asus is now letting gamers use the number crunching power of their graphics cards to earn a share of profits from cryptocurrency mining.  The company announced Thursday that it has partnered with mining app provider Quantumcloud to allow gamers to earn ""passive income"" by allowing access to their Asus graphics cards (or GPUs) when not being used for other PC tasks. Earnings will be paid out via PayPal or WeChat.  The app uses gamers’ GPUs to collectively power cloud-based miners to – in theory, at least – generate profit, giving card owners a percentage based on the amount of power provided, Quantumcloud’s website says.  The privacy of customers' financial data on the app is protected under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Asus stressed.  “As part of its pledge to protect user data, Quantumcloud launched with GDPR compliance in place and does not require customers to create a unique login. Instead, customers use their existing PayPal or WeChat account to log in and collect their earnings,” the firm said.  Quantumcloud, however, does not guarantee that users of its software will make a profit. “Earning rates may change based on the performance of the cryptocurrency market and cannot be guaranteed or influenced in any way by Quantumcloud,” according to the announcement.  More commonly, crypto miners use their GPUs to mine cryptos individually or collectively in pools, using dedicated software downloaded onto their PCs. Some cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, however, can't effectively be mined with GPUs, requiring dedicated processors called ASICs to mine due to the high levels of difficulty.  Crypto miners are going through tough times currently, though, with prices low and mining difficulty high. Hundreds of thousands are estimated to have left the industry in recent weeks. And just yesterday, China-based mining giant Canaan Creative temporarily slashed prices of its all crypto mining devices to $200 each.

42381372,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95Ldx,1543568451,Intel Wins Patent for Energy-Efficient Bitcoin Mining,"Global tech giant Intel, known for its widely-used computer processors, has won a patent connected to its work in the area of cryptocurrency mining.  On Tuesday, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded the company a patent outlining a processor which claims to be able to conduct ""energy-efficient high performance bitcoin mining,"" specifically naming the SHA-256 algorithm used by the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  As reported, Intel has previously sought patents related to its work in the area of crypto mining. And it was Intel's foundry that produced the chips for the mining operation run by 21 Inc, which later rebranded as Earn.com and was ultimately acquired by Coinbase.  Per the patent, bitcoin miners may be rewarded for their efforts by receiving a block reward and transaction fees. However, mining machines for the bitcoin network generally require hardware accelerators, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and therefore require a large amount of energy.  Hardware accelerators are needed in particular for processing 32-bit nonces, strings of bits used once during a transaction. Current ASICs process these transactions in multiple stages with redundancies.  As the patent explains:  ""Dedicated Bitcoin mining ASICs are used to implement multiple SHA-256 engines that may deliver a performance of thousands of hashes per second while consuming power of greater than 200 [watts]. Embodiments of the present disclosure employ micro-architectural optimizations including selective hardwiring certain parameters in Bitcoin mining computation.""  Hardwiring these parameters would lower the number of computations required, it says, estimating that such a system would reduce the amount of power needed for a chip by 15 percent. The resulting chip would also be smaller than those used for bitcoin miners at present.  The patent also hints that changing how much of the 32-bit nonce is compared for validity could further lower power requirements.  ""Instead of comparing the final hashing result with the target value, [the] bitcoin mining application may determine whether the hash out has a minimum number of leading zeros,"" the patent states.

42429982,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2mXh,1543554004,"Developers Rally Around Ethereum 1x, A New Roadmap for Faster Scaling","An influx of research and development is beginning to form around ethereum 1x, a proposed upgrade that aims to more quickly improve the usability of the world's third-largest blockchain.  While the exact code changes that will comprise the upgrade have yet to be settled, active discussions suggest a myriad of different proposals could be activated by June 2019, should a final proposal ultimately be formulated, proposed and approved by users of the ethereum network.  Still the plan, first reported by CoinDesk last week, is in its early stages of development.  Indeed, there's even been a suggestion by Afri Schoedon, release manager for the Parity ethereum client, to release the upgrade on its own, separate blockchain network. Nevertheless, there are many voices contending ethereum 1x ought to be activated on the existing blockchain – and soon.  Originally thought to be an addition to an upgrade called ethereum 2.0 – ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has referred to it recently by an older name “Serenity” – the roadmap for this upgrade changed in June to include new design specifications that are projected to delay activation.  As explained to CoinDesk by Schoedon, developers are now more certain ethereum 2.0 will not go into production before the year 2020. According to Schoedon, developers “started panicking and saying, ‘Hey we really need to find intermediate solutions’” – creating the impetus for new ideas able to be implemented in the near-term.  And though ideas for ethereum 1x may “sound too radical or controversial” for now, Schoedon said that the goal is to discuss any and all ideas inclusively with community stakeholders such that “none of the upgrades will be controversial in the end.”  With plans for ethereum 1x originally discussed during in-person meetings at an ethereum developer conference, Devcon4, earlier this month, certain members of the community were disgruntled at the lack of public involvement. Still, the controversy has been set aside for now with the creation of public forums to openly discuss ethereum 1x.  In addition, meetings to coordinate efforts on this proposed upgrade are expected to proceed under Chatham House Rules, meaning public disclosure of the content of discussions must exclude speaker attribution.  With the intent of encouraging open discussion among developers, the first of these meetings will occur tomorrow at 14:00 UTC.  “We need to to be very sensible about how we do this,” Schoedon told CoinDesk, adding:  “We need to be very inclusive with everyone in the community and be very open and transparent about talking about all the ideas and discussing what might be the best approach.”  A big state  According to meeting minutes from earlier discussions at DevCon4 published by Dan Heyman, the program director of ethereum blockchain development group PegaSys, there are currently four different working groups tasked with advancing ethereum 1x.  One of these groups, led by ethereum core developer Alexey Akhunov, is leading the effort to introduce storage rent to the ethereum platform. Storage rent is a mechanism discussed by developers in detail back in March. Its purpose is to curb the growth of the ethereum “state” – otherwise understood to be all of the active applications and accounts operating on the blockchain network.  Given the fast acceleration of decentralized applications (dapps) built on ethereum through smart contracts – self-deploying lines of code – the amount of data being stored on the blockchain to support these contracts is also increasing.  This presents an issue for new users wanting to participate in the network by deploying software called nodes that download and maintain a full copy of the active blockchain state.  The larger the state, as Akhunov told CoinDesk, the longer it takes for new computers joining the ethereum network to download such copies and maintain them.  Adding to this, Schoedon estimated the size of ethereum blockchain data to be currently sitting at around 125 gigabytes, with the active running state of the network being roughly 10 gigabytes.  “It's growing at a pace that we're probably looking at 200 or 300 gigabytes of chain data by end of next year and a massive state,” said Schoedon.  As such, the proposal to charge a fee to users who are storing smart contract data on the blockchain is aimed at mitigating the speed at which the ethereum blockchain is currently growing and thereby ensure accessibility of the network for all users at least in the short-term.  However, this is not the only proposal currently being discussed among developers. An alternative proposal suggests moving certain portions of smart contract data off-chain. This would effectively push the responsibility of data storage to dapp developers.  The mechanism – called “stateless contracts” – to facilitate off-chain smart contract data would be simpler to implement than storage rents, Akhunov concedes.  Still, there are concerns with this proposal as it relates to how dapp developers share and update off-chain data.  “I have a problem with stateless contracts at the moment. People think they are actually easier to implement and they are easier to implement in terms of protocol upgrade,” said Akhunov. “But they will be much harder for the dapp developers to support.”  Hand-in-hand  In addition to storage rent, another 1x-focused group is exploring proposals to archive old information stored on the blockchain in a bid to relieve the pressures of a growing state.  But outside of ethereum’s data storage mechanisms, a third team of developers – called “the simulation group” – aims to “analyze the issues that happen through the blockchain when block size grows or when the latency increases,” Akhunov said.  This is particularly relevant due to code optimizations that have increased the speed of block propagation on ethereum presently. As a result of new blocks being relayed throughout the network more quickly, ethereum miners are also expected to be able to add in a greater number of transactions per block and collect a larger amount of transaction fees.  Akhunov said that studies suggesting exactly how much more the maximum amount of transaction fees collected by miners – called the “gas limit” – are few and far between.  “There are only a few studies that have been done to analyze how blocks propagate through the network and what would happen if you raise the gas limit,” said Akhunov.  Some of the development efforts going into ethereum 1x are focussed on running simulations to test higher gas limits, given that it's a key area of research around the wider progress toward relieving scaling pressures faced by the network today.  As such, ethereum 1x – outside of addressing issues to do with blockchain state size – is also expected to feature improvements to transaction throughput on ethereum. Indeed, the two issues go hand-in-hand in the context of supporting more network activity.  According to Akhunov, ethereum 1x is an “ensemble” of different proposals that are only effective when deployed together.  He told CoinDesk:  “We want to solve these problems together and not just one thing. It has to be solved as an ensemble rather than one thing at a time.”  Out of the box  The dovetailing nature of the groups also covers the fourth working team, which is looking into decreasing the cost of smart contract deployment. The idea is that such efforts could lead to ways to balance out a potential increase to smart contract storage costs with proposals like the rent one.  By putting forward an early implementation of eWASM – a new virtual machine that processes smart contract code – ethereum developers aim to leverage the new technology and create so-called “precompiles” more easily.  Precompiles are commonly deployed smart contract operations that are optimized to run natively on ethereum for a fixed fee, or gas cost. And as Akhunov explains, there are currently only a handful created on the ethereum network.  But the demand is high for more to be added to streamline smart contract development.  With a “limited number of people in the core development team,” Akhunov admits that “if we try to start implementing all the precompiles people are asking for, we’re never going to be able to do anything else.”  One of the biggest hurdles when it comes to developing precompiles is deciding what a fair gas cost for a particular smart operation should be.  Normally, developers create formulas to gauge the energy and time precompiles take to execute. But through leveraging the eWASM engine, this process of pricing is done automatically.  As Akhunov highlighted:  “The eWASM engine will do something called metering. It will meter the operation and it will charge exactly as much gas as being consumed by the operation.”  Predicting the construction process of precompiles to get much “easier” for ethereum core developers through the technology, Akhunov also added that once fully-tested, “the plan is to open eWASM for all smart contract developers.”  Indeed, the longer-term goal is to do away with the need to create precompiles all together. Among other benefits to smart contract developers, the eWASM engine as previously reported is expected to run all smart contract operations at native network speeds and efficiency.  Still, until that future is realized, etheruem 1x is envisioned to sustain the ethereum network with what Parity developer Afri Schoedon calls “out of the box” solutions.  And while all these solutions are projected to be activated on “a very accelerated timeline,” Schoedon highlights that, on his part, no concrete action will be taken until a ""broad consensus in the community"" is reached.
