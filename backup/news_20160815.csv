42399274,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijWs,1471292445,Why EBA Proposals Would Set an Absurd Precedent for Bitcoin Startups,"Adam Vaziri is the founder of Diacle, a ""finreg"" compliance and legal consultancy based in London and Hong Kong, and a member of the UK Digital Currency Association.  In this opinion piece, Vaziri discusses the European Banking Authority's new proposals for digital currency regulation and why they could make starting a bitcoin exchange more onerous than opening a bank.  The European Banking Authority (EBA) wrote an opinion on the application of its 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD) to virtual currency exchanges and wallets last week.  A response to recommendations from the European Commission, the EBA's remarks notably mention that VC exchanges and wallets operating in multiple countries in the EU ""may […] be required to be registered or licensed in each Member State in which they intend to provide VC-related services"".  The seemingly small aside in the nine-page response is notable, as such a measure would be akin to the state-by-state registration process that VC exchanges have to do in the US.  This is due to the fact that there are no passporting rights granted under 4AMLD – understandable, as the regulations are not designed to facilitate the movement of goods, services or capital, but are simply motivated by the public policy imperative of protecting the EU from terrorism and crime.  At Diacle, we take the view that a member state-level registration is an unnecessary burden placed on VC exchanges and wallets.  A small VC exchange and wallet operating in the EU would not only need to register as an ""obligated entity"" in its home state, but in every other member state of the EU where it operates – an unfathomable task. This particular duplication of registrations would create a disproportionate burden on VC operators compared with other regulated institutions in the EU.  A prepaid card is issued by an electronic money institution (EMI) licensed by the Electronic Money Directive. That EMI can 'passport' the services it provides to other member states seamlessly through its home state regulator.  Yes, indeed, that EMI still needs to adapt its customer due diligence (CDD) to any additional requirements of AML or counter-terrorist financing (CTF) laws in the host state. However, the EMI does not need to apply directly state-by-state for AML/CTF registration.  Financial implication  If a standard authorization or licence takes six to 12 months to obtain, then what of an AML/CTF registration?  Usually that process can take between three to six months, however, the VC exchanges and wallets will now need to contend with language barriers, administration and bureaucratic fragmentation in each member state where it wants to do business.  It is sadly ironic that registering in 50 states in the US may be easier as at least the process is in one language. The same state-by-state requirement in the EU will mean the VC exchange operator will need to contend with 24 official languages.  Paradoxically, the process of state-by-state registration will be far more cumbersome in terms of capital and operational resources than if the VC exchange and wallet simply applies to become an EMI or, at a push, a challenger bank.  This surely must be an unintended consequence.  The EBA interprets this implication as a matter of fact, however our view is that this must, at the very least, be unintended as the result is absurd considering the following preamble statements from the EU Commission.  These read:  ""Due account was taken of the need to respect the freedom to conduct a business, and while there will be an impact on market players becoming obliged entities and currently not performing any customer due diligence (CDD) on their customers, the ability to operate a virtual currency exchange platform is not affected by the proposed amendments.""  'Fit and proper'  The above position is worsened when you consider the requirement that, according to the EBA, the ""amendments proposed by the Commission introduce a requirement that those who hold a management function in, or are the beneficial owners of, [VC exchanges and wallets] are fit and proper persons"".  Although evidently the EU Commission has not fleshed out what 'fit and proper' test will be in practice, it is reasonable to expect that this will be an assessment of the background of the applicants and provision of documentation (passport, proof of address) possibly notarized, apostilled and translated.  Imagine a VC exchange or wallet having to do this in 28 member states.  The average costs of producing documentation that has been officially translated will be a minimum of €1,000 to €2,000 per owner or manager.  Next steps  If the EU Commission were to accept the EBA’s interpretation that all VC exchanges and wallets will need to register individually in each member state where they operate, this would be the biggest regulatory blunder for a region expounding the job creation opportunities of FinTech.  Again, it would be absurd to assume that the intention of the EU Commission is to make it cheaper to set up a licensed payment institution or electronic money institution or even challenger bank than be regulated under 4AMLD as a VC exchange or wallet.  Overnight, the overhead of VC exchanges and wallets would increase exponentially, meaning most likely the beginning of January 2017 could see a full consolidation of the VC exchange and wallet market in the EU.

42399242,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihL6,1471288160,Cryptsy CEO Denies He Stole From His Own Exchange,"Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon has fired back at allegations he moved millions of dollars in funds from the now-defunct digital currency exchange to personal accounts.  In new statements, Vernon told CoinDesk that the finding, issued by the court-appointed receiver earlier this month, is ""misleading"", arguing instead that the contested money movements came as a result of mingling business and personal accounts.  The allegations stem from an ongoing class action lawsuit filed in Florida earlier this year, a move that resulted in the exchange being placed in receivership.  Vernon told CoinDesk:  ""This is an interpretation by the plaintiff with the sole purpose of strengthening their case. Were there business mistakes made during the course of Cryptsy's operations? Of course, every business makes mistakes. One mistake that was made, which is a common mistake in small business, is mixing personal and business accounts.""  Cryptsy collapsed earlier this year following months of growing complains about withdrawals. The exchange ultimately closed its doors, blaming a debilitating hack in 2014 that it said had left it insolvent and with millions in liabilities.  Vernon did not not immediately respond to questions about the other allegations included in the filing, such as the claim that he deleted information from Cryptsy’s servers before the receiver took possession of company assets.  He further accused the receiver of ""intentionally"" avoiding information that ""may be detrimental"" to his case, while refuting claims about the exchange improperly handled funds held in alternative digital currencies.  ""I do not know why the receiver, whom is supposed to be neutral, is cherrypicking information that only benefits the plaintiff,"" he said.  Representatives for the class-action lawsuit’s plaintiffs were not immediately available for comment.

42399243,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihK7,1471273009,New KnCMiner Owners Seek to Revive Bitcoin Firm With Acquisition,"A preliminary sale that would find bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner continuing under new ownership has been approved, according to those close to the deal.  Speaking to CoinDesk, court-appointed receiver Nils Åberg today confirmed that a sales agreement was reached on Friday with a Swedish firm called GoGreenLight. Founded for the purpose of completing the acquisition, GoGreenLight is a new sister company to Borderlight, an Uppsala-based IT and telecom firm founded in 2000.  Notably, Borderlight's Sten Oscarsson said that GoGreenLight could continue to operate KnC's bitcoin mining pool and data centers once it assumes leadership.  Oscarsson told CoinDesk:  ""We will run the mining to the extent that it is profitable, but in addition to our core business. We have a strategy to solve their current problems. It’s most likely the case that we’ll be a player.""  Oscarsson said his firm is aware of the struggles KnCMiner had in adapting its model from one focused on direct-to-consumer sales to one focused on industrial mining, but that it could acquire talent as part of the deal.  ""It was one of the few operations that had successfully competed on the world market,"" he continued.  While GoGreenLight is in discussions to hire members of the KnC team, no previous owners are involved with the acquiring firm, he added.  The developments follow an update from Åberg in July in which he suggested KnCMiner, which entered bankruptcy in May, was considering multiple buyers.  However, he indicated the GoGreenLight team provided the most compelling of all proposals.  ""This was the best alternative for the estate and the creditors,"" Åberg said.  Åberg further said that ""additional considerations"" needed to be finalized before the sale was properly concluded.

42399250,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihRz,1471263033,Blockstream Adds to All-Star Blockchain Developer Team,"Bitcoin development startup Blockstream has announced a slew of new hires that serve to further the firm’s already impressive technical team.  Covering new additions to its engineering, finance and operations and special projects divisions, the announcement formalizes some relationships that have been semi-public for months, while including other, more recent moves.  For example, BitPay open-source lead Eric Martindale, now the company's ""technology evangelist"", has been with the company for over a year in some capacity. Further, Andrew Poelstra was co-author of the sidechains white paper, the technical proposal for which Blockstream would raise upwards of $20m toward the end of 2014.  Elsewhere, Blockstream announced the addition of former Swiss Federal Institute of Technology researcher Christian Decker, best known for his work on Duplex micropayments channels. Decker will continue this work by contributing to the bitcoin Lightning Network, an alternative implementation of a similar concept, on behalf of Blockstream.  In statements, the startup sought to stress the diversity of the new hires in terms of subject matter expertise and geographic distribution.  The company said:  ""With this new group, we're now even more distributed as a company with people working from across the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.""  The announcement follows the startup’s acquisition of wallet startup GreenAddress in July.

42399247,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihN4,1471257312,Bitfinex Heist Rings the Alarm of Bitcoin Centralization,"Nozomi Hayase, PhD, is a writer who has been covering issues of freedom of speech, transparency and decentralized movements.  In this opinion piece, Hayase discusses the recent hack at a major bitcoin exchange and why she believes this should serve as a call to action for those who believe in decentralized solutions and their virtues.  The problems associated with operating a bitcoin exchange are not going away.  On 2nd August, Bitfinex, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges by volume, became the latest to declare itself the victim of a major security breach. Accounts were hacked and consumer funds stolen. The ghost of Mt Gox stirred again.  Yet despite the issues, exchanges still serve as gateways into bitcoin, the interfaces with the world of central banking. With large exchanges like Coinbase and Bitfinex dominating the trading scene, commercialization has come to the fore of what was once a grassroots movement spurred by anarchists and technologists.  These fast-growing companies provide convenience to users, while at the same time, funds accumulated in a handful of exchanges tend to concentrate risk and create single points of failure.  The Bitfinex theft represents another failure of centralized systems. While some call for more regulation, it appears that new solutions are already emerging within the ecosystem.  Promise from the future  As Bitfinex works to restore its services, interruption from the hack has encouraged community members to examine what has become the familiar landscape of centralized exchanges.  It may be helpful here to look back at the genesis of cryptocurrency.  The message embedded in the first block of the blockchain reads: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"". This can be seen as a warning about an alarming future, locked in a trajectory from the past.  Bitcoin presented a choice that has never existed before. Its mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto described it as ""a distributed system with no single point of failure…"" where ""users hold the crypto-keys to their own money and transact directly with one another, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending"".  The white paper published under pseudonym was a promise. Bitcoin, which became operational in 2009, was its fulfillment. The promise was to build security through cryptographic proof, replacing third-party trust and creating networks resilient to counter-party risk.  The 2008 financial crisis coupled with unprecedented institutional corruption began to unveil adversarial forces that the creator of this technology had recognized.  Assumptions about governments, namely that they are ""there to protect us"", have increasingly been challenged. Trusted third parties that are meant to serve the people are actually often doing the opposite.  The high interest rates of many credit companies are verging on predatory. Corporations skim massive profits through service fees and chargebacks. They target the poor and migrant workers with remittances and usurious loans, and are now even going after the middle class. Central banks debase currency, while governments using media propaganda divert taxpayer money to fund resource wars.  New vision of security  This force of control is found not only in monetary transactions.  The centralization that was implemented for efficiency has now planted the seed for data mining, making systems vulnerable to censorship and spying. Edward Snowden's disclosure of NSA mass surveillance revealed the degree of its egregiousness.  In response to the demand for reform that came after the revelation, US President Barack Obama swiftly moved to defend the secret surveillance program. At that time, he told the American people, ""You can’t have 100-percent security and also have 100-percent privacy."" Then he noted that people have to make choices as a society. His solution was for the public to simply trust the government.  As most money now has become digital, central servers that collect information have devastating consequences when personal data is breached. Contrary to Obama's expressed claim of security, the truth is that people under indiscriminate surveillance no longer have privacy, nor do they have the security to protect themselves against governments that operate in secret and erode their basic rights.  Unlike the security promised by politicians entrenched in power, bitcoin is built on a different vision of security. The Cypherpunks who advocate use of strong cryptography as a means for social change held the idea that ""we cannot expect governments, corporations or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.""  They saw that people must come together to build new systems.  Bitcoin developers, who are inspired by this same vision, strive to build a new model of security that does not make anyone compromise their civil liberty. Carried by a passionate network of peers around the world, in these last seven years, this security has never been broken.  Despite recent setbacks with Bitfinex, Bitcoin’s hashrate right after the hack was at an all-time high.  Open-source protocols  Bitcoin is a community-driven free software project.  Its network immutability is supported through decentralization. Satoshi's anonymity represents the core of this technology. By keeping the network horizontal, from its origins to its development, it maintains an unprecedented model of security and the ecosystem grows organically.  In this, decentralized exchanges could become a vital link that connects many users to bitcoin’s network, yet there is a shortage of these exchanges.  Bitsquare  is one of the few fully decentralized and censorship-resistant exchanges that is attempting to fill this gap. Launched in late April this year, it aimed to creatively tackle issues intrinsic to centralized exchanges.  After the Bitfinex incident, an account that belongs to the exchange tweeted:    Time to extend Bitcoins model of ""Be your own bank"" to ""Be your own exchange"".@aantonop      — Bitsquare (@bitsquare_) August 3, 2016    Founder Manfred Karrer explained how Bitsquare is decentralized by removing trusted third parties from exchange transactions, allowing anyone to buy and sell Bitcoin with national currencies and alternative cryptocurrencies.  Using Tor Hidden Service for the server, the project tries to bring stronger privacy protection that could address bitcoin's weak anonymity. What is unique here is that Bitsquare is not just a decentralized exchange, but it is a protocol aimed at keeping the network open. Bitsquare is not a registered company. It is an open-source project that can be studied, modified and freely shared.  Bitsquare’s commitment to decentralization is practiced through its choice of prioritizing security over convenience, manifested in their act of not holding users funds or collecting data. This priority also extends to how they bootstrap the organization, valuing community-oriented development, rather than top down management driven by rapid growth and profits.  After Bitfinex’s security breach, Bitsquare is now gaining more traction, with clients currently supporting 73 different altcoins. In this early stage of the project, it has some limits, so there is room for improvement.  Solution from below  Centralization has been a dominant paradigm of the society we live in today.  Corporate structures are organized hierarchically, divorcing CEOs from the needs of their own employees and customers – often turning people into cogs in a machine. This style of organizing not only dominates markets, but greatly influences political systems. As a consequence, governments are increasingly becoming foreign to the people they are supposed to represent, creating a vast divide between those who govern and the governed.  In the world of trusted third parties, we have become ""consumers"" who are meant to passively accept programs and apps that are designed without much consideration for our best interests. On the other hand, distributed systems empower individuals and increase the role that users play in the network.  One lesson from this Bitfinex heist may be to realize our own power and the responsibility that comes with it. This can become a collective wisdom that makes the community stronger.  Decentralization creates a fertile ground that nurtures diversity. Platforms like BitMarkets and OpenBazaar that enable fully P2P markets bring a space for people to directly engage in trade without anyone in the middle. The more decentralized exchanges and projects there are, the more that both risk and opportunity are distributed.  Problems of centralization cannot be solved through the same modes of thinking that created them. Instead, solutions require innovation from below.  Security through cryptographic proof was a promise.  Our network effect of participation can fulfill this promise, making the system bulletproof; one that cannot be hacked, Goxed or Bitfinexed and that leaves the tyranny of the past behind.
