42422942,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yn5h,1391886531,"Why Mt. Gox, the World’s First Bitcoin Exchange, is Dying","“I think I just witnessed Mt. Gox die today. I didn’t get my bitcoin, but glad I came and tried.” - Reddit user ‘CoinSearcher’, after conducting a three-day protest at Mt. Gox’s headquarters in Tokyo.  Mt. Gox  , the world’s original and once-largest bitcoin exchange, appears to be in a state of disarray after it suspended bitcoin withdrawals to work on what it said were technical issues. Meanwhile, the clamour of angry customer voices is growing.  The exchange’s moves have had a negative impact on the bitcoin markets. The price of 1 BTC plunged from $850 at the start of the week to $681, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, in the wake of the Gox announcement. It has promised an update on Monday 10th February (Japan time).  The internal workings of Mt. Gox have long been the focus of discussion in the bitcoin community. Users have reported delays in obtaining a ‘verified’ account there after submitting the required identification documents.  — Laflamme Photo (@LaflammePhoto) February 7, 2014  Frustrated bitcoin owners have also written about unresolved customer service requests after suffering delays in withdrawing funds from the exchange, with some taking to Twitter to express their opinion on it.  70% polled cannot withdraw their money  A CoinDesk survey of readers who use Mt. Gox has found that nearly 70% of respondents have not received their funds after making withdrawal requests from the exchange. Some 914 respondents said they were still waiting to receive their funds. The median waiting time was between one and three months, with 22% reporting wait times of between one week and a month.  About a third of respondents said they did successfully withdraw funds from Mt. Gox – many of whom had short waiting times. About half reported receiving their funds within a week.  But for everyone else, the waiting game continued. The CoinDesk survey revealed that having a ‘verified’ or ‘trusted’ account at Mt. Gox did little to reduce withdrawal delays.  The majority of CoinDesk readers polled, or more than 85%, said they had ‘verified’ or ‘trusted’ accounts at Mt. Gox. Some 68% of verified account holders, or 822 respondents, said they were still waiting for their withdrawal from the exchange. The median waiting time was between one and three months, and 78% of verified account holders polled said they had been waiting for up to three months.  The CoinDesk survey has attracted more than 2,800 responses since it went live on 4th February.  Reddit user flys from Australia to Gox for sit-in protest  It took a lone protestor to bring the simmering dissatisfaction with Mt. Gox to a boil. Flying for 16 hours from Australia to Japan for a three-day sit-in on a quest for answers as to the fate of his large bitcoin balance, the protestor, known on Reddit as ‘CoinSearcher’, eventually confronted CEO Mark Karpeles and business development manager Gonzague Gay-Bouchery.  The protestor later posted a summary of his experiences on Reddit.  CoinSearcher appeared to alleviate some users’ fears that the top Mt. Gox executives had vanished. Gay-Bouchery’s explanation that most of Mt. Gox’s bitcoins were kept in secure, and not quickly accessible, physical cold-storage in multiple locations made sense to many.  “Because Gox is the best known of all the exchanges, we have been under the regulatory spotlight,” Gay-Bouchery told the protestor, adding:  “This has created problems with government agencies, and also with our banking partners [...] there are also some ongoing investigations, which we cannot talk about.”  Gay-Bouchery refuted data published by The Gox Report that the exchange had a backlog of 40,000 BTC – worth about $34m at the time – that had not been processed, saying that the figure was “not correct” (Mt. Gox subsequently altered its API to cut off real-time information to sites like The Gox Report). He reiterated the company’s claim that withdrawal problems were merely a technical issue, and that “all the coins are safe”.  After attending the weekly Tokyo bitcoin meetup on Thursday night, CoinSearcher said:  “There was a general consensus amongst the participants that Mt. Gox was finished as an exchange. They acknowledged that Mt. Gox had played an important role in propelling bitcoin to what it is today, but its decline and ultimate closure was inevitable.”  A spread that was too good to be true  One of the clearest signs that all was not well on Mt. Gox was the exchange’s quoted US dollar price for bitcoin. Quoted prices on Mt. Gox began to diverge sharply from two other major exchanges, Bitstamp and BTC-e, last July. The initial spread shows Gox prices trading at several percentage points above the other exchanges throughout that month.  By the end of August, however, the divergence hit double-digits. Gox prices were more than 19% above BTC-e’s prices on 22nd August, for example. Although the spread oscillated in the following months, it consistently exceeded the 10% mark.  In the run-up to the freeze on Gox, on 28th January, the gap between Gox and Bitstamp’s rates stood at 20%, while the same measure between Gox and BTC-e stood at 26%.  The persistent price differences seemed to be a flagrant violation of the ‘law of one price’ – the economics concept that posits that the price of a freely traded good should be equal across all open markets.  In theory, the massive price differences between the exchanges suggested that there was a persistent arbitrage opportunity to buy bitcoin cheaply on Bitstamp or BTC-e and sell them at a double-digit premium on Mt. Gox.  But as the CoinDesk survey shows, Mt. Gox customers have consistently failed to withdraw their funds from Gox over at least the last three months, when the spread was widest. This suggests that in practice, most opportunists transferring currencies to Gox to take advantage of a higher sale price would have failed to get their funds out of the exchange.  A measure of desperation  The seemingly incredible arbitrage opportunity and Gox’s withdrawal freeze are linked. The roots of the Gox premium can be traced back to June, when the exchange announcedhttps://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20130620.html it was putting US dollar withdrawals on a “temporary hiatus”.  It later transpired that Gox and its founder, Mark Karpeles, had been ensnared in an operation by US federal agents as they moved against the exchange for failing to register as a ‘money service business’.  The US Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service seized three accounts linked to Gox containing more than $5m. As research from The Genesis Block shows, the executed seizure warrant was dated 19th June, the day before Gox announced it would halt dollar withdrawals.  All the market observers CoinDesk spoke to agreed that the cause of the Gox premium was the exchange’s persistent withdrawal failures, dating back to June, when US dollar withdrawals were stopped.  As the freeze took effect, Gox customers turned to bitcoin withdrawals as they attempted to get funds out. This worked for a time, but it also increased the volume of bids for bitcoin on the exchange.  “Effectively, the Mt. Gox price reflected the inability to withdraw funds in fiat. This creates only a bid for bitcoin,” said Greg Schvey, co-founder of The Genesis Block.  As a result of the increased volume of bids for bitcoin on Mt. Gox, the bitcoin price began to rise steadily, adding to a widening divergence from prices quoted on other major exchanges.  “We can interpret [the Gox premium] as a measure of fear on the part of customers that they’re not going to get their money back. Their desperation is measured by how much they’re willing to pay for bitcoin [on Gox],” said Garrick Hileman, an economic historian at the London School of Economics.  ‘Coding himself out of a mess’  While the exchange has posted a number of notices on its website announcing withdrawal delays, its top executives have remained silent on the matter. The company has posted a notice of delays on its main trading page since the beginning of 2014, originally citing a backlog caused by Japanese New Year business holidays as the cause.  One prominent technical member of the bitcoin community thinks he knows what’s behind the current withdrawal freeze. Andreas Antonopoulos, who recently joined Blockchain.info as chief security officer, says he has studied exchange technologies over the past 15 years. His verdict on Gox’s withdrawal freeze, as an outsider, is scathing:  “Mt. Gox has built an exchange based on a hodgepodge of technologies that are really not suitable for running an exchange. And it’s being run by people who don’t really have experience building and operating scalable systems.”  Antonopoulos outlined what he believes to be the technical reasons behind the Gox freeze. The root of the problem lies in its decision to use a version of the bitcoin client it customised itself, rather than the standard client. As a result, Gox handles the protocol with some discrepancies.  One of those discrepancies, as Antonopoulos understands it, is the way transactions are propagated through the network. A miner on Gox, for example, will prematurely be credited for a new block before the network has a chance to confirm the transaction. As a result, when the transaction hits the bitcoin network to be corroborated, it is rejected. Gox’s solution is to cancel the initial transaction and resubmit it until it is approved.  “This is like putting a Band-Aid on the problem. Gox should not be generating non-standard transactions in the first place. Band-Aids like this will further exacerbate scalability problems,” Antonopoulos said.  In the case of the mining example, the cancelled and resubmitted transactions cause delays in fulfilling withdrawal requests within Gox. This doesn’t necessarily cause huge problems unless the system is under pressure from an external factor, like a spike in withdrawal requests, for example.  “When transactions increase, then there are more delayed transactions, which can cause a panic. It just snowballs,” Antonopoulos said.  A lack of detailed comment or response from Mt. Gox to users or the media has only increased customer concerns about the fate of their money. The company’s location in Japan – where outsiders’ access to information is often limited by a language barrier – has shielded the company from the kind of scrutiny a US-based operation would receive. Furthermore, Gox’s chief executive has made little attempt to address the issues publicly.  “I’ve heard that Mark [Karpeles] has rolled up his sleeves and is trying to code himself out of this mess,"" Antonopoulos said. ""It’s clear that he lacks the expertise to fix this other than applying another Band-Aid. The things they’ve done in the past won’t get them out of this.”  Looming insolvency?  Roger Ver declared last July he had looked at Mt. Gox’s books and determined it had plenty of fiat currency in the bank, and that withdrawal delays were not being caused by a lack of fiat. He was still optimistic the exchange would fulfill its obligations.  “I don’t have any special insight into Mt. Gox at the moment, but if I had to guess, I think they have the bitcoins and the fiat,” he told CoinDesk.  “I actually think, in the long run, this will be good for bitcoin because it will be clear to the world that there is an open invitation for true professionals to quickly dominate the bitcoin exchange industry.”  Bobby Lee, CEO of exchange BTC China, which actually eclipsed Mt. Gox’s trading volumes at times in 2013, said he also accepted its official explanations. While he didn’t see its immediate problems reaching China, he said negative stories about a company the size of Mt. Gox “could put a damper on the whole bitcoin ecosystem”.  “I was actually quite surprised to hear about the suspension of bitcoin withdrawals at Mt. Gox,” he said.  “Their restrictions and delays on fiat currency withdrawals seem suspicious to me, as there is no adequate explanation for that.”  He went on to say: “Regarding the BTC withdrawal limitations, since they promised to give everyone an update on Monday, I would give them the benefit of doubt at this point. It would also help customers understand better, if Mt. Gox can make a clear statement about their overall solvency status.”  Other prominent bitcoiners were less gentle:  — jeremy liew (@jeremysliew) February 7, 2014     Antonopoulos’ technical appraisal of Gox may be damning, but he stops short of indicting the exchange for being fraudulent. He pulls no punches with his verdict on their business acumen, however:  “I do not think Gox has solvency problems. It’s simply a business being run in an amateurish way, in a market that is far more demanding than can support amateurish operations.”  CoinDesk also contacted US exchange and payment processor Coinbase, but it declined to comment.  Innocent beginnings  Mt. Gox, owned by a company called Tibanne Ltd, was the largest bitcoin-fiat currency exchange from 2010 until last year. It started life in 2009 as a place for players of Magic: The Gathering to trade cards. Tibanne is run by Mark Karpeles, who acquired the exchange from founder Jed McCaleb in 2011.  In its four-year history, the pioneering exchange has suffered hacking attempts, DDOS attacks, and the same regulatory issues that have plagued other bitcoin businesses.  Along with technical issues, the glare of law enforcement’s spotlight since April 2013 has seen Mt. Gox’s US dollar market-share plunge from over 70% in April to about 19% now, significantly behind Europe’s Bitstamp and BTC-e with 30% and 24% respectively.  Mt. Gox is also the subject of a current $75m lawsuit from former partner CoinLab, which it has also countersued for $5.5m.  Legacy of resilience?  One of the recurring themes in Mt. Gox’s story is its ability to recover from seemingly insurmountable setbacks, be they bank account seizures or electronic theft. The media has made a habit of chronicling the ‘fall of Mt. Gox’ (Wired, Business Insider), with CoinDesk being no exception – only to be proven wrong when the exchange’s volumes bounce back. Some market watchers remain reluctant to count Mt. Gox out, even with its current freeze on withdrawals.  “Every time it’s had some seemingly crippling issue, it’s always managed to maintain market-share,” said Schvey of The Genesis Block.  Mt. Gox’s historic position as the dominant exchange in the global cryptocurrency economy appears to have helped it build a valuable brand that has linked it inextricably with the growth of bitcoin itself. As new bitcoin users flood into the cryptocurrency economy – which has grown from a market capitalisation of a $250m just 12 months ago to $8.6b today – many of these new investors start their cryptocurrency education at the foot of Mt. Gox.  “New buyers come in and they don’t know the history. There is a lot of brand recognition, and it’s going to take time for that brand to be completely destroyed through incompetence,” said Antonopoulos.  The Mt. Gox freeze may have dampened the price of bitcoin, but Schvey, for one, believes the impact has already been priced in.  “We saw major sell-offs on Gox, but the market impact looks like it’s largely been realised at this point. As soon as people get their money out, other exchanges will pick up [market-share],” he said.  In Antonopoulos’ view, however, the story of Mt. Gox isn’t one of resilience in the face of adversity. Instead, the constant breakdowns in Tokyo tell a tale of gradual disintegration, with each breakdown or withdrawal freeze jolting the firm closer to the edge. He said:  “They will keep causing crashes in the bitcoin network until everyone abandons them, so abandon them sooner rather than later. Not because they’re frauds, but because they are amateurish – clownish – in their operations.”  This article was co-authored by Joon Ian Wong, Jon Southurst and Emily Spaven.

42425425,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7ph,1391858659,US Government Says Apple is NOT in Violation of Antitrust Law,"The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has stated it will not take action against Apple for its recent decision to ban bitcoin apps.  The announcement comes amid a growing furore among bitcoin users, who were outraged by Apple’s decision to remove the official Blockchain app from its App Store earlier this week.  The DOJ stated:  “We have determined that the information provided does not raise antitrust issues that warrant further review by the Division.”  This response was prompted by bitcoin enthusiast Andy Chase, who submitted an official complaint to the agency’s Citizen Complaint Center.  Chase’s complaint was detailed, including an annotated explanation of bitcoin, and a detailed overview of the actions Apple has taken against apps from bitcoin companies, such as Blockchain, Coinbase, Coinjar and Gliph.  Chase summed up his argument with the following conclusion:  “While Apple may have legitimate claims against the use of these applications in countries where bitcoin use is prohibited, the companies should be provided with the ability to alter and re-submit their applications to operate within the terms and conditions provided by Apple and international law.”  Further, Chase was far from the only person to suspect Apple may be in violation of antitrust laws, with even major industry investors commenting as such publicly:  Government response  The DOJ did not elaborate on its decision, and has not responded to requests for further comment. Instead, the department sent Chase three web links that it believes clarify why Apple is not in violation of antitrust laws.  These included the Department of Justice main website, a six-page guide called “Antitrust Enforcement and the Consumer” and a lengthier primer on antitrust issues for law enforcement officials.  It is likely the DOJ’s decision stems from the fact that Apple, which offers no payment services, does not directly compete with the bitcoin companies it has banned.  The complaint process  The Antitrust Division’s Citizen Complaint Center lists four steps that a complaint may take through the agency. Upon examination, Chase’s complaint did not make it far into the process, failing to garner even an additional review.  The CCC creates a record of the information provided.  The CCC conducts a preliminary review.  If the complaint raises concern under federal laws, it is sent to a legal team for review.  If the CCC needs more information, it will contact the claimant within one month.  Chase, commenting on the decision, lamented that this was “pretty much the lowest level of rejection”. Still, he doesn't regret reaching out:  “While I wasn’t very confident that my complaint would lead anywhere (if nothing else, the bitcoin community is fairly small for the DOJ to invest in actions protecting its interests). I wanted to take advantage of the justice system and see if they were willing to look into it.”  Image credit: Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.com",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/08/us-government-says-apple-is-not-in-violation-of-antitrust-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea96acbc230edfa9ebdb32766589910db71248d8-1000x906.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422924,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymVh,1391852860,Minecraft's Law Firm Sheridans to Start Accepting Bitcoin Payments,"Top-tier media and entertainment law firm Sheridans has announced that it will begin taking payment in bitcoin. The firm currently has about a dozen clients in the bitcoin economy, said Eitan Jankelewitz, a technology lawyer in the firm who promoted the initiative internally.  “[Accepting bitcoin] is driven by an understanding at Sheridans that there’s no reason not to. I don’t see any reason for a retailer, or a service provider like us, not to accept bitcoin,” he said.  Jankelewitz said the firm’s clients involved in the bitcoin economy included mining equipment manufacturers, wallet operators, exchanges, investors and retailers who accept bitcoin. All of those clients had asked Sheridans if they could pay in bitcoin, according to Jankelewitz.  Jankelewitz said most of his company's bitcoin clients ask for advice on user terms and conditions agreements:  “The first thing people want to do is start making money, so the first thing we do is get them their standard terms of business.”  He said that there was little objection to adopting bitcoin for payment within the firm. The firm’s auditors and anti-money-laundering specialists were consulted and had no objection, he said, adding that the company would convert bitcoin payments to pounds sterling immediately.  While Sheridans is ranked in the top tier of firms specialising in media and entertainment, it is not one of the so-called ‘Magic Circle’ firms. This is a colloquial term for the five law top firms in the United Kingdom, which currently includes Allen & Overy, and Slaughter and May.  The company is also ranked in the top tier for firms specialising in media and entertainment and media finance by the Legal 500, an authoritative ranking of law firms around the world.  Sheridans is known for its work with Mojang, the maker of the hugely popular game Minecraft.  Some legal questions surrounding bitcoin in the UK currently include the tax authority's treatment of the digital currency, registration by exchanges under money laundering regulations and banking safeguards for consumers.

42425429,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7xh,1391818904,Why Lower Bitcoin Price Volatility is No Panacea,"Prior to the nearly 20% pullback in bitcoin’s price we’ve witnessed in the last 24-hours, there had been a fair amount of digital ink spilled suggesting that bitcoin’s price volatility may be decreasing.  Rob Wile of Business Insider, Alex Wilhelm of TechCrunch, and Timothy B. Lee of the venerable Washington Post all wrote pieces over the last week suggesting that bitcoin is becoming less volatile.  Before addressing the question of whether bitcoin volatility is in fact declining, why is bitcoin volatility important?  There are in fact several reasons, but all the recent articles explicitly or implicitly emphasize one view in particular, which is that bitcoin adoption should increase if the price becomes less volatile. For example, Alex Wilhelm of TechCrunch says:  “Essentially the more wild the swings in its value, the less useful bitcoin is as a tool of commerce.”  I will come back to Wilhelm’s point at the end of this post, but first let’s examine the claim that bitcoin volatility is in decline.  Eyeballing bitcoin volatility  It does not take a PhD in statistics to make a few observations about bitcoin’s price volatility.  The above Chart 1 is from Rob Wile’s post and is used to support the claim that bitcoin volatility has recently declined. The period that Rob highlights with a red arrow (the month of January 2014) certainly looks very flat and stable.  The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) from 7th January through 4th February more-or-less agrees with Wile's data from Bitcoin Average, with the BPI range-bound between $800-$900 for the past month. [Editors note: this has since changed following today’s pullback.]  When our eyes deceive us  Now, comparing the recent period depicted in Wile’s Chart 1 with the immediately preceding period (11th November – 20th December) depicted below in Chart 2, it’s fair to say that our eyes aren’t misleading us.  In the month of November bitcoin’s price more than doubled, only to fall by over 50% in December following news that China had banned its banks from dealing in bitcoin. This price action is reflected visually in the jagged, 'mountain range' appearance of Chart 2.  In short, even with today’s pullback the last several weeks have seen nothing like the larger price swings and higher volatility seen back in November and December.  But here’s the question: have there not already been much longer periods of relative price stability following a large spike and then decline in bitcoin’s price than what has been observed since the beginning of January 2014?  In other words, even prior to today, were Wile et al getting a little ahead of things by intimating that the bitcoin volatility dragon has been slain?  Chart 3 below depicts data taken from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index over the past twelve months.  For the six-month period following the April price collapse (May to October 2013, highlighted with the red arrow line) the price of bitcoin looks very flat, appearing to be about as stable as Wile’s Chart 1 depiction of January 2014 – but for a much longer period (six months vs Wile’s one month).  But zooming in on the red arrow period in Chart 3, we can see that our eyes are deceiving us.    Chart 4 above reveals upon closer inspection that the period between late-April through mid-October was anything but ‘flat’.    For example, bitcoin’s price declined by approximately 50% on Mt. Gox from the June peak to the July trough. This 50% loss in value may not have been as dramatic as December’s sudden plunge, but it equals it in terms of percentage decline in bitcoin’s market cap.  Data visualization tricks of the trade  The above discussion and charts are intended to raise two points. The first being that the way data is visualized can have a significant impact on the conclusions we are likely draw from eyeballing charts used to make claims about, say, bitcoin volatility.  Why? Well, because adjustments to both the scale shown on the Y axis (vertical) and time period depicted by changing the X axis (horizontal) can significantly alter what the data appears to ‘say’ in charts.  For example, below, Wile’s chart (left) is positioned alongside a chart of the CoinDesk BPI (right) for the period of 7th January – 4th February 2014.  Here you can see how the period of time which appears flat in Wile’s chart on the left becomes a jagged mountain range when shown with different Y and X axis ranges on the BPI chart on the right. Wile accomplishes this by including earlier period data back through September, which allows for a larger scale Y axis.  This potential for the same data to tell a different story based on how it is visualized is not something Wile et al mention when making their claims.  This brings me to the second point, which is more of a question on whether statistical measures can provide a more robust means of explaining whether bitcoin volatility is decreasing.  Statistically speaking, is bitcoin’s price volatility declining?  The recent discussion of bitcoin volatility trends appears to have been kicked-off by a blog post on 20th January from Eli Dourado, a PhD student at George Mason and research fellow at the Mercatus Center.  Dourado’s blog post, which was titled ‘Bitcoin Volatility is Down Over the Last Three Years. Here’s the Chart that Proves It’, shows bitcoin’s historical volatility using price data from Mt. Gox.  Immediately we can see one potential problem with Dourado’s approach: his choice for source data. By relying solely on data from one exchange, Mt. Gox Eli brings into his analysis price elements which may only be related to issues at Mt. Gox.  These issues include downtime due to DDOS attacks, as well as the so-called ‘Mt. Gox Premium’ where bitcoin can often trade for as much as 20% more on Gox than other exchanges like Bitstamp or BTC-e which are part of the CoinDesk BPI. Dourado fails to acknowledge this problem.  His results, depicted in the chart below, show a declining trend in volatility, and that the trend is statistically significant with a univariate OLS regression yielding a t-score on the date variable of 15.  Putting aside the data source issue, does Dourado’s argument close the case and prove that bitcoin volatility is declining? Unfortunately the answer is not so simple.  In response to Dourado’s post, Robert Sams over at Cryptonomics basically says “not so fast, Eli”, stating that Dourado’s “claim that 'there is a clear trend of falling volatility over time' isn’t defensible at all”.  In the chart below, Sams analyzes the same data, but instead of using Dourado’s 30-day rolling window method he employs a rolling two-year window. This, in effect, causes the early months of bitcoin to fall out of the sample period.  As Sams notes, his analysis “tells a very different story” than Dourado’s.  Matthew Martin, on his blog Separating Hyperplanes, also takes Dourado to task on his statistical method, and largely concurs with Sams’ critique. After performing several additional tests Martin concludes by saying: “I cannot tell you which way bitcoin volatility is going, but I can tell you that Dourado can't either.”  However, Dourado responded to Sams and Martin in the comments section of his original blog post and, while acknowledging their criticism, basically stands by the headline conclusion from his original analysis.  So where do things stand in the debate about trends in bitcoin volatility?  The bottom line here is that statistical methods can, in fact, face similar issues as data visualization when it comes to settling questions about bitcoin’s volatility. Sources, time periods chosen, methods, and other test design decisions often make statistical results less than definitive.  Put simply, where you place the statistical goalposts matters.  In terms of alternative volatility measures, as previously discussed, there are a number of reasons why calculating bitcoin’s beta coefficient (or ‘beta), a common measure for measuring volatility of securities, would appear to offer dubious value.  What’s missing from the recent bitcoin volatility debate  While there may be evidence to support both sides of the debate over bitcoin volatility trends, there is another important aspect of bitcoin volatility which is being overlooked.  Timothy B Lee of the Washington Post states that he sees a pattern in bitcoin’s price action, comparing this recent bounce back and stabilization with earlier bitcoin price action episodes. He concludes by stating that “bitcoin will stabilize in the future”.  And perhaps bitcoin will in fact stabilize in the ‘future’, whenever that may be. But what Lee and everyone else is failing to address is whether, from a pro-bitcoin perspective, lower bitcoin price volatility is desirable?  There is a view in the bitcoin community, captured in the earlier Wilhelm quote that “essentially the more wild the swings in its value, the less useful bitcoin is as a tool of commerce”, which is not entirely true.  Certainly, if you are interested in seeing more people holding bitcoins then, yes, one could argue that lower volatility could make it more attractive to hold bitcoins from day-to-day in the same way people hold US dollar banknotes in their wallets. Reduced volatility should build confidence in bitcoin as a stable store of value.  Lower bitcoin volatility is no panacea  However, the flip side of lower volatility is that bitcoin will lose many of the well-heeled momentum investors who are attracted to bitcoin’s relatively high volatility vis-à-vis other asset classes. And while it might be tempting to believe that bitcoin would be better off without these momentum traders, the bitcoin community needs to be careful what it wishes for here.  Today, bitcoin has a relatively small total market capitalization of around $9bn. A lower total market capitalization also equals less total potential liquidity, and liquidity is an extremely important driver in markets today.  One of the reasons investors are so attracted to the US Treasury bond market, for example, is because that at approximately $11tn in total publicly traded debt it is the deepest, most liquid asset market in the world today.  The Treasury market features a very large number of active buyers and sellers, allowing global investors to quickly move very large sums of money in and out of the US Treasuries.  In contrast, bitcoin’s relatively miniscule market capitalization and correspondingly thin liquidity make it a non-starter for many. One thing that would help change this is if bitcoin’s market cap increases.  A growing bitcoin market cap could have several positive knock-on effects, such as new businesses deciding to accept bitcoin, and institutional investors including bitcoin in their longer-term portfolio holdings.  Momentum investors could help further boost bitcoin’s market cap and overall liquidity during the current growth phase. However, if volatility vanishes then don’t expect these fast-moving traders to stick around.
