29913224,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626167,1719270012,Solana Price Braces For Potential Crash Below $100 Amid Investigation Rumors,"The Solana price has experienced a sharp decline over the past month in line with the broader market correction, intensifying concerns as rumors of a potential investigation into the popular blockchain platform have recently surfaced. Regulatory Storm Brewing? In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), market expert Crypto Bitlord, who has a considerable following of over 300,000 people, hinted at a rumored investigation into Solana. The post read: We are hearing rumors that SOL is under investigation and a huge case is about to be made public. This has been brewing for weeks and couldn’t come at a worse time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $61,000: The Main Reasons While no specific details about the jurisdiction or agency conducting the alleged investigation into Solana have been disclosed, the United States has been at the forefront of an ongoing crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry since the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in late 2022. The aftermath of the FTX incident resulted in a series of lawsuits and charges against various industry executives. Notable figures like Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and Coinbase have faced legal scrutiny. A comparable scenario can be drawn with XRP and Ripple, as they have been engaged in a complex legal showdown over the sale of the digital asset. For Crypto Bitlord, who has contributed to projects such as Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Pepe Coin (PEPE), the potential impact on the Solana price is significant. In response to skeptical comments, Bitlord warned, “Don’t cry when SOL is $3 again.” However, until further news emerges regarding the alleged investigation, these statements remain speculative. Solana’s founders have made no official statements regarding these rumors. Solana Price Analysis The Solana price has experienced significant losses across various time frames, with declines of over 9%, 18%, and 22% in the past seven, fourteen, and thirty days, respectively. However, despite the downward trend, trading volume for SOL has remained robust, surpassing $2.8 billion in the past 24 hours alone, according to CoinGecko data. Digital asset investment firm CoinShares reported notable inflows into various altcoins following the recent price weakness, with Solana seeing inflows of over $2.7 million. This suggests that despite the price decline, some investors see potential value in SOL and are strategically entering the market. Related Reading: Toncoin On Fire: Crypto Explodes To All-Time High – Can It Hit $10? Nevertheless, the Solana price faces a critical test as it approaches crucial support levels. Currently, SOL is trading just above a four-month support level at $127, which marked the uptrend when the Solana price reached a yearly peak of $210 in mid-March. If selling pressure intensifies and this support is broken, SOL could retrace down to $117, representing the token’s next significant mid-term support level. Other support walls for SOL in the event of a sustained bearish move are at the $109 and $102 levels. These levels should be watched closely by bullish investors looking to prevent Solana from falling below $100.

29911437,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626115,1719266455,Shiba Inu Enters Accumulation Zone Amid 493% In Shibarium Transaction Fees,"The current Shiba Inu price action might be leaving some investors wanting, particularly as the crypto has now extended its 30-day losses by over 30%. However, recent on-chain data and technical analysis indicate that the patience is about to pay off. To be more specific, the current price downturn has seen Shiba Inu entering the accumulation zone, which could signal the start of the next bull run. At the same time, a concurrent 493% increase in transaction fees within the Shibarium network suggests it could be the ideal time for investors to load up. Shiba Inu Price Hits 100-Day Low As Bears Take Control The past few weeks have been a bloodbath for Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders. After rebounding at the $0.000022 support and spiking briefly to reach $0.00002756 in the last week of May, the popular meme coin has plunged over 30%, briefly crashing below $0.000017 this week. This brutal selloff has dragged SHIB to a 100-day low, wiping out billions from its market cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash: Crypto Analyst Reveals Why Price Could Drop To $52,000 Experts have blamed this fall on investors pulling out of meme coins. Shiba Inu wasn’t left out, as the meme coin also witnessed major transfers to crypto exchanges. From the price side of things, SHIB’s decline means traders now have the opportunity to buy at its current low prices, which may herald the reversal of the bearish trend. You would think with SHIB’s price taking a beating lately, activity on the network would be slowing down. Surprisingly, that’s not the case at all. Recent data from Shibariumscan indicates that transaction fees on the Shibarium layer-2 network have skyrocketed by 493% last week. The massive surge in transaction fees came from increased transaction activity on the network. Notably, the number of new transactions moved from 5,865 at the beginning of the week to 16,337 at the end of the week, a 178% increase. Although transaction fees on Shibarium are paid in BONE tokens, a portion of the tokens are converted into SHIB and then burned. This, in turn, reduces the amount of SHIB tokens in circulation. What’s Next For SHIB? At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001702 and seems to be consolidating. Experts are now divided into different schools of thought about the future of meme coins, including SHIB. According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the current downtrend suggests meme coin dominance in the altcoin market could finally be over. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Turns Bullish After Losing Streak – Is A 1,000% Rally Possible From Here? On the other hand, analyst Javon Marks believes Shiba Inu still has room to break to the upside, and the recent pullback could also be a contributing factor. Marks asserts that Shiba Inu is still up by 100% since its last bullish wave and it has the potential to go up by another 294%. Price targets are at $0.000081 and $0.0001553.

Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Rally Over?

Commenting on the consistent outflows, Butterfill noted: We believe this is in reaction to the pessimism amongst investors for the prospect interest rate cuts by the FED this year. Notably, the US was not alone in experiencing these outflows; significant sums were also withdrawn from funds based in Canada, Germany, and Hong Kong. Contrarily, funds based in Brazil and Switzerland witnessed net inflows, indicating a varied global response to the current economic climate. While Bitcoin faced the brunt of the withdrawals, Ethereum also saw notable outflows, with $58 million leaving Ethereum-based investment products globally. This occurred despite the anticipation surrounding new issuers’ S-1 registration filings with the SEC, hinting at potential launches. However, not all cryptocurrencies suffer from these conditions. Altcoins such as Solana, Litecoin, and Polygon experienced net inflows, suggesting that some investors are viewing the current market weaknesses as potential buying opportunities, according to Butterfill. Bitcoin Market Turbulence and Optimistic Forecasts Amidst these financial shifts, the broader crypto market has felt the impact, with Bitcoin’s price falling by 4.7% in the past 24 hours and 6.6% over the past week, currently trading at around $61,186. This downturn has had a cascading effect on traders, with significant liquidations occurring in the market. According to Coinglass, 91,772 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations amounting to $308.97 million. Of this, Bitcoin traders alone faced $123.35 million in losses. Amid market volatility, Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, a global Bitcoin application, maintains a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future. In discussion with analyst Scott Melker, Mallers expressed confidence that despite current price fluctuations, Bitcoin could reach between $250,000 and $1 million in the coming cycle.

On the day, the blue-chip Dow ( DJI ) finished on top by 0.6% . At the same time, the benchmark S&P 500 ( SP500 ) closed out the session lower by 0.3% , and the Nasdaq Composite (COMP.IND) ended lower as it lost 1.0% . From a sector point of view, nine of the 11 S&P segments rounded out Monday's trading on a higher note, with Energy at the top of the leaderboard. In reverse, the worst performing sector on the session was Info Tech. “While the short-term technical trend for equities is still bullish, the macroeconomic environment is highly uncertain, given the rising risks of a deflationary recession. Equity market valuations are historically elevated, and prudent long-term investors must continue to exercise caution in the face of FOMO,” Seeking Alpha analyst Ahan Vashi stated. The Treasury market experienced limited movement. The shorter end U.S. 2 Year Treasury yield ( US2Y ) was near flat at 4.73%. At the same time, the longer end U.S. 10 Year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) slid 1 basis point to 4.24%. See how other yields trade across the entire yield curve here . On the economic front, the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index remained in negative territory in June. The index came in at -15.1 versus the forecasted -14.0 level. Moreover, investors will also keep their eyes peeled for May’s personal consumption expenditure data, which is expected to come at the end of the week. The data comes amid an environment where the Federal Reserve is looking for further signs of slowdown and a fall in inflation to start easing monetary policy. In the mega-cap space, Nvidia slid for a third straight trading session as it loses $300B in market cap . At the same time, Jefferies has raised its price target on NVDA’s stock to $150 per share from $135 per share and increased its estimates for the AI chipmaker. NVDA ended on Monday lower by 6.6% . Amazon ( AMZN ) is working on an artificial intelligence chatbot to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Chief Executive Andy Jassy is personally involved in the project. Also on the move were shares of Teladoc Health ( TDOC ) as it jumped 6.7% on the trading day after a presentation at the American Diabetes Association's 84th Scientific Sessions showed how artificial intelligence-predictive modeling can be used to help individuals control their blood sugar .

Bitcoin Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse Has Just Turned Red As explained by CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse is now giving a red signal. The Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) is an indicator that tracks the BTC movements between spot and derivatives exchanges. When the value of this metric rises, the amount of cryptocurrency going from spot to derivatives platforms goes up. Such a trend implies that large entities like the whales are potentially looking to open up new positions in the derivatives market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Under $64,000: Here’s Where The Next Support Is On the other hand, a decline in the indicator suggests investors are transferring fewer coins to the derivatives exchanges. This trend could signal a decreasing appetite for risk positions in the sector. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin IFP, as well as its 90-day simple moving average (SMA), over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin IFP had been climbing earlier, but the metric seems to have reversed its direction recently, as it’s now heading down instead. Following the latest decline, the indicator has crossed below its 90-day SMA. Historically, the IFP observing a cross with its 90-day SMA has signified a market sentiment shift. A breakout above this line suggests the whales are willing to take risks with the asset again, which can potentially be a bullish signal. The chart shows that such a cross occurred around both the 2018 and 2022 bear market lows. On the other hand, a plunge under the 90-day SMA usually takes place near tops, as it implies the whales are looking at derivative positions as too risky. Related Reading: PEPE Has 80% Of Holders In Profit: How It Compares To DOGE & BTC As the indicator has once more seen the latter type of crossover, it’s possible that the asset could end up facing some bearish momentum. This possible shift to a bearish sentiment, however, doesn’t have to last for too long. The previous instance of the IFP dropping below its 90-day SMA in January. This crossover coincided with Bitcoin’s downturn following the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. The bearish momentum ended up only temporary, though, as the cryptocurrency soon found a breakout that led to its new all-time high (ATH). The asset observed only a temporary effect from this crossover in 2016 before catching back an uptrend into the 2017 bull run. It remains to be seen where this bearish Bitcoin IFP crossover will lead to this time. BTC Price Bitcoin hasn’t seen an end to its recent decline, as its price has now dropped to $61,200.

29903419,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626114,1719250249,Solana Developer Shares “Big News” That Could Send The SOL Price Flying,"Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana’s development platform Helius Labs, recently shared “big news” that presents a bullish outlook for the Solana ecosystem. This development could also positively impact Solana’s price, which has recently been on a downtrend. A New Dawn For Solana Mumtaz mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that “ZK compression” is being introduced directly on the Solana network without requiring layer-2 networks. He claimed that this changes everything and every impression one has about Solana and scaling layer-1 networks. Mumtaz further explained what the ZK compression is really about. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Withdraws 2.2 Billion SHIB From Robinhood, Should You Follow The Whales? He stated that they have managed to compress the on-chain state to get “10,000x scale improvements,” which he claimed brings them one step closer to building the financial computer. He added that this means that developers can “now build and scale anything they want directly on Solana without needing to leave it.” Mumtaz also gave an example to highlight how significant this development was in terms of a reduction in transaction costs. He claimed that it would usually cost over $260,000 for a project to carry out an airdrop to 1 million users. However, ZK compression makes it way cheaper now as only $50 will be needed now to airdrop these tokens to those 1 million users. Furthermore, on the technical side, Mumtaz highlighted how this is a much-welcome development for Solana developers. He noted that allocating accounts, paying rent, and scaling with users has been a “massive roadblock” for them, but that has now been fixed with this ZK compression. Mumtaz also highlighted how this opens the door for Solana to enjoy significant growth, noting that state growth has been a major issue for scaling blockchains. However, that is set to change now as ZK compression makes it possible to compress all Solana state. The Helius CEO added, “This has further implications for hardware requirements and the overall performance of the entire network.” Mumtaz believes Solana has a “real shot at this crypto thing” when this ZK compression is combined with “firedancer, multiple concurrent leaders, async execution, and ecosystem of thousands of insanely cracked devs.” Institutional Investors Also Believe In Solana’s Potential The introduction of ZK compression on Solana follows the recent prediction made by Pantera Capital’s analysts that Solana will steal a massive chunk of the crypto market from Ethereum in terms of blockchain developer activity. These analysts highlighted Solana’s “monolithic architecture,” which enables several use cases and user experiences. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash: Crypto Analyst Reveals Why Price Could Drop To $52,000 They added that Solana’s technology enables “compelling applications” and gave examples of crypto projects that have benefitted from Solana’s capabilities, including the non-fungible (NFT) platform DRiP. Asset manager Franklin Templeton also previously predicted that Solana would become the largest crypto token by market cap thanks to the network’s “superior tech.” They claimed that Solana would host the sectors that will drive the next wave of crypto adoption and also alluded to the firedancer update as one of the reasons they are bullish on Solana.

Of that, Thorn believes 65,000 coins will be going to individual creditors, but he thinks they may prove more ""diamond-handed"" than most expect. Among the reasons, he said, is that they've already resisted years of ""compelling and aggressive offers from claims funds,"" not to mention the capital gains taxes involved given bitcoin is up 140-fold since the bankruptcy.

42417877,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbqvN,1719246169,"Biden Likely to Win Popular Vote, but Lose Presidency, Prediction Market Signals","This week in prediction markets:  Joe Biden likely will win the popular vote – but not the election, Polymarket prices signal.  The incumbent U.S. president isn't accepting crypto donations (yet).  Barron Trump’s alleged involvement with the Martin Shkreli-backed DJT token is … a matter of debate.  Donald Trump is one of only five U.S. presidents who won the electoral college, and thus the nation's highest office, despite losing the popular vote. If prediction markets are correct, he will repeat that feat this year.  On Polymarket's contract asking who will win the popular vote, ""yes"" shares for President Joe Biden are trading at 56 cents, indicating the market sees a 56% chance of the incumbent prevailing. Each share pays out $1 (in the USDC stablecoin) if the prediction comes true, and zero if it does not.  Trump, meanwhile, has only a 36% chance of winning the popular vote, according to recent prices. Traders have bet $36 million on this question, making it Polymarket's fourth-largest market by volume.  The largest by far, of course, is the one on who will win the presidency, with a record $182 million of bets placed. Here, Trump is the clear favorite, with a 57% chance of winning versus 35% for Biden.  Under a regulatory settlement, Polymarket blocks U.S. users, so its traders are presumably making predictions from afar. PredictIt, a more traditional U.S. election betting site that settles bets in dollars with a quasi-regulatory blessing, gives Trump a 52% chance of winning the presidency and Biden 47%. The volume there is comparatively small, though, at $15.7 million.  The Electoral College was conceived at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. It is designed to balance the influence of populous and less populous states, ensure smaller states have a voice in the election, and prevent a few large states from dominating the outcome. The popular vote, which carries no electoral weight, is simply the proportion of votes cast for each candidate.  The college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors' votes is required to win the presidency. Each state has the same number of electors as it does members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member of the House of Representatives (the number of House members is proportional to a state's population) plus two Senators.  Critics of this time-honored system call it undemocratic, while its defenders argue that it is a bulwark protecting the rights of the minority against potential tyranny of the majority. This much seems certain: If the Polymarket bettors are right and Trump does win the electoral college while losing the popular vote, ""Not My President"" rallies will be back in vogue.  Donation negation  Nearly two weeks after a report surfaced that Biden would follow Trump in accepting cryptocurrency donations, the president's campaign still hasn't done so, to the detriment of Polymarket traders who bet it would.  To be fair, the ""Biden accepts crypto donations by Friday?"" contract, which launched June 12, had a tight timeframe of nine days. The odds were as high as 48% early on but plummeted to zero. The market resolved to ""no"" on June 21, because the campaign had made no such announcement.  If Biden is weighing the option as claimed, it's still possible an announcement could come later. That's one of the risks of prediction markets: It's possible to make a bet that's directionally correct but still lose money because it didn't come true within the agreed-upon timeframe.  Read more: He Exposed Harvard President's Plagiarism, Then Lost Money Betting on the Story  Trump's wholehearted embrace of crypto in May was followed by signs the Biden administration was softening its hardline stance against the industry, making plausible the scenario in which the incumbent would accept crypto donations.  Barron drama  Was Donald Trump's son Barron really a part of the team behind the Solana-based DJT token that dominated crypto headlines and discourse last week?  A Polymarket contract on that mystery resolved to ""no"" on Sunday but that decision was disputed. It resolved again to ""no"" and was disputed a second time. A final review is ongoing. It is expected to be closed Tuesday.  Drama erupted on Monday in the Discord forum for UMA, the third-party oracle service responsible for refereeing bets on Polymarket. The forum was packed with “yes” shareholders making the case that their bet was correct.  At issue is whether ""a preponderance of evidence suggests that Barron Trump was involved in the creation of the Solana token $DJT,"" as spelled out in the Polymarket rules.  Neither the Trump campaign nor Barron have made any public statements about the matter, so those insisting the preponderance of the evidence suggests his involvement are relying largely on the word of Martin ""Pharma Bro"" Shkreli, who served six years in prison for securities fraud.  Shkreli said last week he created the token with Barron’s involvement following a contentious $100 million bet with popular crypto traders.  The relatively new token made waves in the community over its supposed status as the “official” Trump token, buoyed mainly by reports alleging Barron was part of the team. Pseudonymous promoters gushed that the token was going to billions of dollars in market cap, and prices rocketed thousands of percent in a week.  But radio silence from the Trump family soon caught on among followers. DJT prices have slumped more than 50% to 1 cent on Monday since a 3-cent peak on June 18.  With the review pending, Polymarket traders are giving the claim a 19% of being true as of U.S. morning hours on Monday, down from a peak of 60% when the market was created on June 21. It has clocked over $693,000 in volumes, making it Polymarket's second-largest market on a crypto-related question.",NEUTRAL,UMA,MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING | UMA,"Marc Hochstein, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/06/24/biden-likely-to-win-popular-vote-but-not-presidency-prediction-market-signals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc64d8602b3c94386abdf38dcde0a3be4b725b92-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29900600,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626152,1719244848,"Ethereum Set For $5,000? ETH Open Interest Expanding On CME Ahead Of Spot ETFs Trading","Ethereum is tracking lower when writing, sinking roughly 18% from March 2024 highs. Even though bears appear to be in control at spot rates, keeping the second most valuable coin below $3,700, confidence is high among analysts. ETH Futures Open Interest Rising On CME Taking to X, one of them noted that there are solid signs that institutions are positioning themselves to push prices higher. Citing rising open interest in Ethereum Futures at CME, a bourse, the analyst said it is highly likely that the “big money” is accumulating ETH, taking advantage of the recent correction. To reassert this outlook, the analyst said the trend observed from the Ethereum CME futures contracts’ open interest is a reliable telltale sign. Notably, this trend mirrors what transpired with Bitcoin futures before the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For this reason, the analyst is convinced that a similar pattern is printing for Ethereum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Target $60,000 Level As Price Continue To Decline Currently, Ethereum is printing discouraging lower lows. Sellers have been resilient, deflating any momentum buildup and placing caps on bulls. So far, it is emerging that $3,700 is a resistance level for traders to monitor closely. Bulls did not launch a counter once it was broken on June 7, and the bear breakout was confirmed four days later on June 11. Despite the current market conditions, the launch of Ethereum spot ETFs could still drive prices to new heights. The analyst predicts a potential expansion to $5,000, confirming the Q1 2024 trend and the breakout above the current flag. Still, whether bulls will be in control depends on how price action pans out. Technically, open interest shows the cumulative summation of both open or long-leveraged positions. If buyers push prices to rise, ETH should expand in the coming days, even breaking $3,700 this week. Spot Ethereum ETF Optimism: Will They Be A Success? Beyond this, the recent flurry of activity surrounding spot Ethereum ETF applications bolsters this optimism. On June 21, seven applicants, whose 19b-4 forms were recently approved, submitted amended S-1 registration statements with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Analysts now think the regulator could approve the trading of these products by early July 2024. Related Reading: Solana Slides 13% – Can It Recover Despite Analyst’s $1,000 Prediction? While bullish for Ethereum, some analysts are not convinced they will enjoy similar success as those seen when spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading.

42417879,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTbqxR,1719243309,The Internet of Things Is Still Broken (But DePIN Can Fix it),"Over a decade ago, I got into the blockchain business because I wanted to fix the Internet of Things.  A decade later, both businesses are thriving and both still have big problems with their business models. It may well be that, like the original internet, we can never really escape bad business models once they take root. I am, for one, skeptical that we’ll ever be free from the our-service-is-free-because-you-are-the-product model of social media, for example.  Still, I have some hope that, as the Internet of Things (IoT) is still relatively nascent, we might be able to use blockchain – specifically in this case blockchain-enabled Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIn) to fix it. At heart, the problem with the Internet of Things is the business model: companies need a constant stream of revenue to maintain their products. Consumers, very understandably, don’t think it’s reasonable to pay a subscription to maintain, say, the software on their door knobs or fridge. The result is a great deal that usually comes with a nasty hangover: products that are free from subscription fees that one day get discontinued because the company selling them wants to stop maintaining the product.  Blockchain offers an alternative, combining open-source technology with decentralized systems, allowing us to build Internet of Things networks that manage themselves and can operate more sustainably.  At the heart of the problem is the mismatch between the life of products and the life of the product-line being sold by the business. We might ditch our smartphones and PCs every three to five years, but generally speaking, lightbulbs, doorknobs, refrigerators and other home devices are expected to stay in place for longer. If you need cloud infrastructure to manage these devices, you have a recurring cost that goes on for a decade or two after you may have sold the product. Combine that with software maintenance costs and it’s easy to see how you can consume all your margin over time.  The result is that, with depressing regularity, companies decide to “switch off” online services for products they used to sell. The result often turns a device you integrated into your life into a brick. Alternatively, the vendor offering the service that was “included” in the purchase prices starts charging. A few years ago, I was suddenly hit with a $90 annual fee to keep my smart door locks running. I suppose that’s better than obsoleting them, but I was so incensed I went out and bought new locks and installed them as replacements. It probably cost me about eight years of service to replace the locks, but my decision was driven by spite, not rational analysis.  Despite some very frustrating experiences, the IoT industry has made some very good progress in the last few years. Devices that integrate with the HomeKit standard and those using the new Matter controls and Thread radios are built from the ground up to run without internet connections. This means their basic functions do not require cloud infrastructure and the burden of maintenance doesn’t fall on a single enterprise.  However, if we want truly smart homes and connected experiences, we will need internet connectivity and cloud computing infrastructure. And, for that, we need decentralized cloud infrastructure as well.  Using blockchains, devices with spare computing capacity and network connectivity can run more complex network level applications.  Want to manage your home power consumption based on the state of the grid? Sell power at the best times or use generative AI systems for a conversational interface? All those things consume a lot of computing power and bandwidth and, if we want a sustainable business and price model, then we must be able to do that without needing lots of new data centers.  The good news is that the smart home devices have become absurdly smart. This isn’t because we really need the intelligence of a smartphone in our lightbulbs. It’s because it turns out that it’s cheaper to put an entire smartphone-level brain in a lightbulb than it is to make a highly customized lightbulb specific smart-chip. Chipmaking is a volume business and building a standard overly-smart chip and using software to make it do things like handle a light or manage a refrigerator is cheaper and more scalable than customizing each device.  The upshot is a lot of idle connected computing power that can be put to work in building a blockchain-linked decentralized cloud computing infrastructure. Your smart home and car can “pay its own way” when it comes to compute power, selling excess capacity when you’re not using it and using more from others when needed. The result should be a sustainable network infrastructure that doesn’t need constant injections of capital from the original product sellers to keep working. If the cloud is, as the T-shirt says, just someone else’s computer – maybe it could be your neighbor's refrigerator?  There are many ways of building decentralized computing infrastructure. But there’s a reason that, when I started down this path more than a decade ago, I chose blockchain and not some other technology: payments and contracts. It’s very simple: if we want a system where smart devices transact with each other to provide computing services, we need accounts, ledgers and agreements. Blockchains come with those baked in.  For more than a decade, I’ve been hoping to see cloud computing, blockchain and the Internet of Things get together. We might, at long last, be approaching that time.

Coatue is also behind CoreWeave, a cloud-computing firm that is looking to buy Hut 8 rival Core Scientific.  The thirst for power by Artificial intelligence (AI) firms is unrelenting, and bitcoin {{BTC}} miners are cashing in.  Bitcoin miner Hut 8 (HUT) shares outperformed most peers on Monday after the Miami-based company received a $150 million investment from Coatue Management to build artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.  The funding will be through convertible notes with an 8% annual interest rate and a conversion rate of $16.395 per share, according to a statement. Hut 8 shares rose almost 4% in Monday morning trading. Most of the company's peers are following BTC lower.  The investment provided a boost for other bitcoin mining-related data centers that also service AI and high-performance computing (HPC) on Monday. Soluna Holdings (SLNH) surged nearly 17% and Applied Digital (APLD) added about 10%.  AI and HPC firms are increasingly looking to the bitcoin mining industry to secure their need for computing power. The miners often already have the computing capacity and the deals with power suppliers that AI and HPC hanker after. In fact, JPMorgan said that the demand for power by large-scale data centers and AI firms could start a new era of mergers and acquisitions for bitcoin miners with attractive power contracts.  Most recently, cloud computing provider CoreWeave signed a 200 megawatt (MW) deal with miner Core Scientific (CORZ) for AI-related services and offered to buy the whole company for more than $1 billion. Core rejected the takeover, saying it undervalued the company.  Interestingly, Coatue Management is one of the investors in CoreWeave, underlining the level of interest in utilizing bitcoin miners' current infrastructure to power AI-related services.  Hut 8 reaffirmed this need for power in Monday's press release.  ""Many traditional data center operators are failing to meet the surging demand for AI compute capacity due to power shortages, long lead times to bring new capacity online, and the extensive upgrades required for existing data centers to support the latest generation of high-density compute,"" it said.

29897771,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626095,1719239435,"Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $61,000: The Main Reasons","In the last 24 hours, the Bitcoin (BTC) price fell by up to 4.8%, plummeting to a new low of $60,601 after trading above $64,000 just a day earlier. This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including developments from the Mt. Gox saga, a significant liquidation of long positions, and ongoing miner capitulation. #1 Mt. Gox News Shakes Market Confidence The sudden and steep decline from $62,900 to $60,601 in Bitcoin’s price coincided closely with a new announcement from the trustees of the defunct Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox. This exchange, central to one of the earliest and largest Bitcoin thefts, declared it would start repaying victims using the stolen assets from a 2014 hack in July 2024. According to Nobuaki Kobayashi, the rehabilitation trustee, the repayment process will include Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and start in early July. “The Rehabilitation Trustee has been preparing to make repayments in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash under the Rehabilitation Plan The repayments will be made from the beginning of July 2024,” the announcement reads. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash: Crypto Analyst Reveals Why Price Could Drop To $52,000 This news was perceived negatively by the market, primarily due to fears of oversupply from beneficiaries likely selling off assets that have massively appreciated since their initial investment period before 2013. In May 2023, the trustee moved over 140,000 BTC, worth approximately $9 billion. This transaction was significant as it was the first movement of these funds in five years, tracked closely by analysts and traders. Market reactions were immediate; Bitcoin prices tumbled as speculations about potential market flooding with these repaid coins took hold. #2 Record Liquidations Of Long Positions Adding to the downward pressure, there was a notable surge in the liquidation of long BTC positions. According to the latest data from Coinglass, a staggering $85.4 million worth of long positions were liquidated. This event marks the largest liquidation since April 30 and May 1, when over $195 million ($95 million and $100 million respectively) in longs were liquidated, correlating with a 12.5% price drop over those two days. Such liquidations occur when the market price reaches the liquidation price of leveraged positions, triggering automatic sell-offs to cover the losses, further driving the price down. This cascade effect contributes significantly to rapid price declines and increased market volatility. #3 Ongoing Miner Capitulation Adds To Sell Pressure The third critical factor affecting Bitcoin’s price is the ongoing miner capitulation. Miner capitulation refers to a situation where miners, particularly those operating with marginal efficiency, begin selling their mined BTC to cover operational costs due to unprofitability. This phase can exert substantial downward pressure on Bitcoin prices as it increases the supply of Bitcoin being sold in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops Below $64,000, But Arthur Hayes Advocates ‘Buy The Dip’ As reported by NewsBTC, renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo and others have pointed out that miner capitulation is a crucial phase to monitor, especially following the Bitcoin halving events that reduce miner rewards by half, thereby straining their profitability. Woo noted recently that the recovery from such capitulations has historically been slow and tied closely to the resurgence in mining activity and hash rates. Crypto expert Jelle, speaking via X, highlighted the ongoing nature of this capitulation today, saying, “Hash Ribbons are showing that miner capitulation is ongoing — exactly what you want to see post-halving. Generally speaking, the market starts rallying once that capitulation phase comes to an end.” At press time, BTC traded at $61,241.

Riot will also look to remove any additional director appointed by the current board of Bitfarms after today.  The hostile takeover bid became public last month after Riot offered to buy Bitfarms for $2.30 per share, an approach that was swiftly rejected. Riot continued to buy its rival's shares to exert pressure on the board to engage with the miner. Subsequently, BItfarms implemented a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"" to deter Riot from buying the company.

Now What?,"Summary Coinbase stock has outperformed Bitcoin, powered by revenue up 111.98% YoY, proving dominance in the Bitcoin ETF custody market. Despite Bitcoin's range-bound status, institutional investments in crypto funds are surging, benefiting Coinbase. While risks include competition from platforms like Robinhood, I believe Coinbase's strong fundamentals and market positioning make it a strong buy. Investment Thesis Since March of this year, while Bitcoin's ( BTC ) price has dropped by over 13% as of the time of this writing, Coinbase (COIN)'s stock has outperformed BTC, falling just 2.39%. Bitcoin's high watermark came in March, with the cryptocurrency trading slightly above $73,800 , which propelled Coinbase's stock to the highest level in almost 3 years​​. Fast-forward to today, BTC is trading at about $63,000. These recent shifts in the Bitcoin market can be largely attributed to significant sell-offs by Bitcoin whales, who have chosen to realize gains following a period of near record-high prices. Bitcoin whales (or large holders of BTC) have sold over $1 billion in BTC over the last 2 weeks. Other large holders, such as the German government, have sold off hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin over the weekend. The sell-off by large Bitcoin holders is a tactical move by Bitcoin ""whales"" to liquidate part of their holdings to capitalize on price spikes. This has been further exacerbated by Bitcoin miners, who faced profitability pressures due to the rise in operational costs and regulatory uncertainties. While the price of BTC is down, Coinbase continues to operate well with BTC custody. As of June 19th, Coinbase currently holds about 4% of BTC in circulation, or 890,000 BTC in their custody. When the spot BTC ETF was approved, Coinbase immediately became the custody partner of 8 of the exchange-traded products. It is clear that Coinbase dominates this sector and is winning the institutional game, with their recent revenue numbers proving this. As of May 2024 , revenue was reported as $1.64 billion, up 111.98% YoY, beating expectations by $265.79 million. I predict we will see this success continue, and I believe, with EPS set to continue to grow significantly. Therefore, I believe Coinbase is a strong buy. Why I Am Doing Follow-Up Coverage Coinbase has outperformed Bitcoin since my last coverage in March, especially considering the general downturn we've seen in crypto prices during the same period. Typically, a decline in Bitcoin could pose a threat to long-run custody fees. However, I think Coinbase's diverse offerings buffer against this. The market's current view of Bitcoin as range-bound is understandable, which some investors may see as a deterrence to future upside potential. Historical data shows that prolonged periods of lateral movement often precede significant price adjustments, either upward or downward. While this could have been bad for future growth in companies like Coinbase, but it's critical to recognize that Coinbase's earnings power extends beyond mere transaction fees associated with Bitcoin trading. Coinbase's revenue base is far more diversified this time around. Coinbase's strategic advantage lies in their dominant position within the Bitcoin ETF custody market. This position is not just about holding assets but also about earning custody fees, which are less sensitive to price fluctuations than transaction fees. Thus, even if Bitcoin prices remain stable, the inflow of ETF assets can still provide a stable revenue stream. The purpose of this follow-up coverage is to demonstrate how BTC will power Coinbase earnings even if BTC's price remains range-bound. I do not expect BTC to remain range-bound, but even if it does, Coinbase's earnings will increase on a year-over-year basis. Bitcoin Is Range-Bound. What Now? Bitcoin has been largely range-bound since mid-March. In April , Bitcoin's halving occurred, which resulted in a decrease in daily supply (daily mined supply dropped from 900 to 450/day). Since then, Bitcoin prices have stayed roughly in a plus/minus 10% range. With Bitcoin's price remaining flat, the influx of institutional investments into crypto funds (Bitcoin ETFs, in particular) has jumped, given that many of these institutions had or no BTC exposure just 7 months ago. I believe despite the market sentiment, optimism among large-scale investors remains robust. Recent 13F SEC filings and analysis from a number of sources have highlighted a significant increase in institutional holdings in these financial vehicles. With recent surges in investment-like the $130 million institutional inflow into crypto funds - Coinbase continues to capture the lion's share of the market​​. I think that even if Bitcoin prices remain static, the growing stock of the cryptocurrency under professional management demonstrates a bullish outlook for the sector. It shows, in my opinion, a strategic move in investment strategies, where traditional funds are increasingly legitimizing and integrating digital assets into their portfolios. Coinbase benefits from all of this due to the asset management and custodying fees I mentioned in my last piece. Valuation Coinbase's forward revenue growth rate is higher at 22.48% compared to the sector mean of 5.12%, which indicates the company's impressive performance relative to their peers​​. In essence, the company is able to outperform sector median growth by 339.44%. With such strong growth, the market has rewarded Coinbase with a forward P/E ratio of 31.85 , which is substantially above the sector median of 10.63. However, I actually think this is a conservative P/E when we consider growth factors. When we do a comparative analysis, we find that Coinbase's forward P/E is 199.70% above the sector median, while their growth rate is actually 339.44% above the sector median. This means buying the stock right now at a 199% premium P/E will get you a growth rate that is 339.44% higher than the sector norm. I think this is incredible. I believe we could see the forward P/E premium expand further to a 300% premium above the sector median given the strong growth rates. This means at this point, we would be paying a 300% premium on P/E to access a company that is growing 339% above the sector median. I think this is reasonable. If the forward P/E premium moved up from a 199% premium to a 300% premium, this would represent about a 50% increase in share price, assuming all other variables stayed the same. What I believe the market is signalling here is that it is not sure if these growth rates can stay this elevated above the sector median. After all, the company saw a decline in EPS and revenue during the crypto bear market in 2022 ( 10-K ). Why would this be any different? I think a key distinction to the previous bull market is custodying fees. Custodying fees grew 90% year over year in Q1 and I expect this growth to continue ( 10-Q ). This is revenue that will allow Coinbase to be far more robust in the next bear market, meaning I believe shares can continue to trade at this premium. Why I Think Coinbase Deserves A 300% Premium I think the biggest reason we can see Coinbase carry a 300% premium is that while we are expecting strong revenue growth over the next 12 months, EPS growth this year is set to be even more explosive. EPS estimates for this year (ending December 2024) are expected to come in at $7.24/share , or 1,856.73% YoY growth. EPS growth for the sector median is expected to come in at just 3.42% year over year. This growth story is, in my opinion, far more than 300% more exciting than 3.42% growth. Keep in mind as well that these estimates (and the ones for 2025) may be conservative as well. Coinbase saw EPS come in at $4.40/share alone in Q1. This is more than 50% of what the full-year EPS is forecasted to be and higher than the full 2025 estimates. So while their current forward P/E may be 199% higher than the sector median, I believe that forward growth for projected EPS also adds credibility to this (along with revenue growth). Forward EPS estimates appear conservative too, allowing room for the forward P/E to come way down while also allowing for a buffer due to the volatility in crypto. How This Compares To My Last Estimate In my last piece of analysis, I believed that shares could move up about 12.5% based on Bitcoin custodying feels getting priced in. Since shares are actually down about 2.39% since this publication, my previous analysis indicates there would be about a 15% upside in shares. However, since we are now incorporating a relative valuation method, I think shares have more upside (around 50%). This is because, in my last piece, I only looked at how custodying fees could push the shares higher. I did not analyze the benefit of Coinbase's subscription revenue too. In this case, we're finding that subscription & services revenue well exceeded the overall company YoY revenue growth of 41%. This revenue grew 122% YoY (10-Q). I think, with such powerful (and more stable) growth metrics, this provides an excellent opportunity for shares to trade at a higher premium to the sector median. Risks While Coinbase has diversified their revenue streams (compared to the last cycle) beyond transaction fees on cryptocurrency trades, a significant portion of their valuation is still influenced by the health and trends of the Bitcoin market. With this, a sharp decline in Bitcoin prices could lead to reduced trading volumes that will affect transaction fee revenues and potentially cause asset flows to reverse as investors pull back from the cryptocurrency space in search of stability or higher returns elsewhere. In an extreme scenario, this would affect custodying fees too. Adding to this is the increasing competition from platforms like Robinhood ( HOOD ), which has recently reported gains in retail flows, particularly in cryptocurrencies. Robinhood's resurgence through their strong rebound in retail trading and a record Q1 2024 revenue fueled by increased cryptocurrency trading. This combination makes them a strong rival against Coinbase's market share. However, despite these risks, I still remain optimistic about Coinbase's future. The overall cryptocurrency market is expected to expand significantly. Innovations and increasing adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors provide a broader base for growth, which could benefit all major players, including Coinbase and Robinhood. In addition, Coinbase has established strong ties with institutional investors and clearly now boasts significant custody assets (this is something that Robinhood, while I am bullish on them, does not do). The company recognizes that their current leads are temporary though unless they invest more. They are doing exactly that. According to Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas, during the company's Q1 2024 earnings call : As we look at 2024, we are going to be making investments. We have planned to be prudent and modest to support the strong performance, we've seen year-to-date and especially some of the early traction that we're seeing, for example, in Base, in USDC and some of these other products, that are not as correlated with crypto market prices and volatility - Q1 2024 earnings call. This segment could see further growth as traditional financial entities seek exposure to cryptocurrencies, potentially stabilizing revenue flows even if retail trading faces fluctuations. The exchange is being prudent about managing risk with market volatility. I like it. Takeaway I believe Coinbase has demonstrated a strong performance so far this year, with their stock price up roughly 29.86% year-to-date. On top of this, even with BTC being range-bound, I think there are compelling reasons to believe there is still more room for growth for Coinbase's EPS. The company's now far more robust business model and strategic positioning have allowed them to clearly outperform despite the broader market's challenges. The key to their success has been their dominance in the Bitcoin ETF custody market and significant transaction revenue gains from both retail and institutional investors. The market for cryptocurrencies as a whole continues to evolve rapidly, with institutional interest and mainstream acceptance growing, I believe this trend will not reverse. Coinbase's initiatives, such as expanding into staking, offering more blockchain-as-a-service options, and maintaining strong security protocols, will help capitalize immensely on these trends. I do not think we have even begun to price in what the fair value of these innovations is. I believe the stock continues to be a strong buy. I'm excited to see where it goes.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4700689-coinbase-bitcoin-has-stalled-now-what?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29895810.jpeg

This drop, which was very sudden, has taken investors by surprise, triggering a massive wave of liquidations. As the volume continues to rise, the crypto liquidation figures have barreled toward $300 million in just 24 hours alone. 91,000 Crypto Traders Lose $282 Million Amid Bitcoin Crash Data from Coinglass has shown that tens of thousands of crypto traders have lost their leverage positions in the last day, leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidations. This comes with the decline in the crypto market, spurred on by the Bitcoin crash. Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Turns Bullish After Losing Streak – Is A 1,000% Rally Possible From Here? So far, the number of traders who have lost their positions has crossed 91,000, and a little over $282 million has been lost since then. With the Bitcoin and crypto market crash, the majority of these liquidations have come from long traders, with an overwhelming 91.59%. As expected, Bitcoin has seen the largest liquidation volumes with $103 million. Ethereum follows in second place with $64 million, while Solana comes in third place with $13 million. Liquidations from others have also crossed $38 million during this time. Binance accounts for around 35% of total liquidations with $102.9 million, while the OKX exchange has recorded $82 million in liquidations. Huobi, Bybit, and Bitmex are in 3rd, 4th, and 5th positions with $47.72 million, $21.33 million, and $15.15 million, respectively. While the largest single liquidation order took place on the Bitmex exchange, where a trader lost $10 million on the XBTUSDT pair. At the time of writing, the majority of the liquidation had taken place in the last 12 hours alone, making up $230 million out of the recorded $282 million. Meanwhile, in the last hour, the liquidation volumes have crossed $102.5 million. Despite the notable liquidation volumes, the last 24 hours are still not the worst day for the month of June. Since June has been riddled with crashes, there have been notable liquidation trends for the month. For example, on June 7, liquidation volumes reached $360 million when the Bitcoin price crashed from $71,000 to $68,000. Related Reading: Little-Known But Important Dogecoin Indicator Goes Off, How High Can It Drive Price? Then again, on June 18, 24-hour liquidation volumes crossed $300 million when the Bitcoin price fell from $67,000 to $64,000. If the Bitcoin price continues to fall, then these liquidation volumes could continue to climb quickly and reaching $300 million could only be a matter of when and not if. The Bitcoin price is currently struggling to hold $61,000, with an approximately 5% decline in the last 24 hours. If bulls fail to hold this support level, the possibility of the price falling to the $50,000 territory becomes much higher.

ClearLoop provides off-exchange connectivity via single wallet access to OKX, Bybit, Deribit, BIT, Gate.io, Bitfinex, Bitget and PowerTrade, with Bitstamp and Bitmart soon to go live.  Kraken MTF, the cryptocurrency exchange’s institution-only derivatives trading arm, has joined crypto custody specialist Copper’s popular collateral management and settlement network, ClearLoop.  Kraken MTF, bought as Crypto Facilities by the exchange some five years ago, is based in London and regulated by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The multilateral trading facility, which does not cater to a retail audience, offers coin-collateralized futures contracts across bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}}, XRP, litecoin {{LTC}} and bitcoin cash {{BCH}}.  After many traders' funds were marooned on the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, there’s been a push toward alternative structures, such as in-custody settlement networks and the like. Copper’s off-exchange network provides hundreds of institutional customers with connectivity to OKX, Bybit, Deribit, BIT, Gate.io, Bitfinex, Bitget and PowerTrade, with Bitstamp and Bitmart soon to go live, according to a press release.  “This plays to a certain type of institutional client base that wants third-party custody, and specifically around the derivatives they are trading, they are able to get that single access point, so a single wallet control and to be able to trade on various different venues and net that risk down over four hours,” Kraken MTF CEO Mark Jennings said in an interview.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bearish sentiment became more pronounced in the crypto market early Monday after defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, which is supposed to return over 140,000 BTC to victims of a 2014 hack, said it will begin repayments next month. Bitcoin slipped to $60,723, registering an over 5% loss on a 24-hour basis at one point. Ether and the broader market followed suit, with the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) also falling more than 5%. Broadly speaking, bitcoin's recent retreat from above $70,000 has taken the shape of a double top bearish reversal pattern. However, spot and futures volumes in bitcoin and ether markets on centralized exchanges have been considerably softer than record highs in March, according to FalconX. That's a sign of decreased investor participation or conviction in selling action, often a characteristic of a ""bear trap.""  Ether traders have been snapping up bullish options on Deribit in a falling market. According to Amberdata, they have been buying ether's September expiry $4,000 call option in large numbers in anticipation of a move to new record highs. ""Looking at the block flows this week, we see a ton of buying activity for the September $4,000 calls,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said, adding it is a sign of traders betting that ""if ETH gets above $4k we likely test and breakout new all-time-highs.""  Japanese institutional investors are warming up to digital assets, according to Nomura's survey of 547 Japanese investment managers. The April survey showed that over 50% of the managers planned to invest in crypto in the next three years, viewing it as a diversification opportunity. Managers could allocate between 2% and 5% of assets under management to crypto, the survey revealed, adding nearly 80% would invest over a year. The pivot to crypto follows mounting concerns about Japan's debt load and the yen's exchange-rate volatility. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet recently adopted BTC as a reserve asset to hedge against Japan's fiscal problems. On Monday, the firm said it would buy another $6.2 million worth of BTC using proceeds from the debt sale.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows CryptoQuant's Coinbase premium index, which tracks the spread between bitcoin’s prices on the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN) exchange and the offshore giant Binance.  The cryptocurrency continues to trade at a discount on Coinbase, reflecting weaker net buying pressure from U.S. investors.

After an impressive rally earlier in 2024, SOL has dipped by 13% over the past week, leaving investors wondering what lies ahead. Related Reading: Toncoin On Fire: Crypto Explodes To All-Time High – Can It Hit $10? Technical analyst, Patel, believes he may have charted a course for the high-speed blockchain’s future, and it involves a refreshing beverage. Examining the weekly SOL/USDT chart, Patel identifies a classic “Cup and Handle” pattern, a bullish indicator that resembles, well, a cup and its handle. Frothy Past, Steady Handle: A Recipe For A Breakout? The “cup” portion of the pattern, according to Patel, stretches from mid-2021 to mid-2022, encompassing Solana’s meteoric rise and subsequent fall. The current consolidation phase forms the “handle,” a period where the price steadies after the initial parabolic movement. For SOL bulls, the key hurdle lies in surpassing the resistance zone around $200-$225, a level that has historically acted as a psychological barrier. A successful breach of this resistance could be the first sip of a bullish resurgence. #SOLANA $1000 Roadmap 🚀$SOL pic.twitter.com/s7KipEbDTd — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) June 22, 2024 $520 Or $1,042: Patel’s Ambitious Price Targets Patel’s analysis ventures beyond the immediate resistance, outlining two potential price targets for SOL in the medium to long term. The first target, TP1, sits at $520, a level that would revisit previous highs and signify a significant upswing. But Patel doesn’t stop there. His second target, TP2, raises eyebrows at a staggering $1,042, reflecting an extremely optimistic long-term view. However, reaching these lofty heights hinges on completing the handle formation entirely. This could involve a further consolidation phase and a potential pullback, a necessary evil to gather momentum for a powerful breakout. Can SOL Weather The Short-Term Squall? While Patel’s analysis paints a rosy long-term picture, the short-term forecast for SOL is a bit cloudier. Current market indicators suggest a bearish undercurrent, with Solana trading below its 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) adds to the bearish sentiment, hovering below 50% and flirting with oversold territory. Related Reading: Forget The Dip! XRP Primed For Epic Rally To $36, Expert Claims In the immediate future, SOL could face a potential downside scenario, with some analysts predicting a dip towards the $118 support level, or even as low as $99. However, there’s always a chance of a reversal. If the tides turn, SOL could potentially surge past the $140 resistance level, setting its sights on loftier targets like $160 and $188. Patel’s analysis serves as a strategic roadmap for investors navigating the choppy waters of the cryptocurrency market. While SOL may encounter some short-term turbulence, the long-term outlook remains bullish, contingent on breaching crucial resistance levels and maintaining upward momentum.

Iris Energy is best positioned to take advantage of the growing HPC/AI opportunity.  Investors are waking up to the alternative use cases for mining facilities and the value of power access.  The bitcoin {{BTC}} mining sector is attracting a wave of investor interest following Core Scientific's (CORZ) deal with artificial intelligence (AI) company CoreWeave, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Monday.  The bank notes that the total market cap of the 14 miners it tracks has grown by 22%, or $4 billion, since the announcement, versus a 7% drop for bitcoin and a 3% increase for the S&P 500 stock index. Core Scientific said it had signed a 200 megawatts (MW) artificial intelligence deal with the cloud computing firm earlier this month. News of the deal triggered a re-rating of the bitcoin mining sector as investors reacted positively to the announcement.  This is a reflection of the ""alternative (and potentially more accretive) use cases for mining facilities and the scarcity and value of power access,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote, adding that the Core Scientific deal ""validates and will accelerate miners diversifying into high performance computing (HPC) programs.""  Overweight-rated Iris Energy (IREN) is best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity, the report said, noting that the company has excess power capacity and is not wedded to bitcoin mining. Iris Energy was early to embrace the HPC trend and is already running graphics processing units (GPUs) at its facilities, the bank noted. The firm has a track record of building and delivering high-quality data centers on time and has access to a decent amount of power.  Neutral-rated Cipher Mining (IFR) has attractive power costs and a strong operational history, but has a smaller power pipeline than Iris Energy, the bank said.  Riot Platforms (RIO), also overweight rated at JPMorgan, ""remains fully committed to bitcoin mining,"" and has not shown much interest in HPC despite its abundance of power capacity.  Underweight-rated Marathon Digital (MARA) and neutral-rated CleanSpark (CLSK) ""screen the most expensive on an enterprise to energized power basis,"" the report said.

29889462,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626083,1719223415,"Bitcoin Bears Target $60,000 Level As Price Continue To Decline","Bitcoin is currently experiencing a notable decline, with its price steadily approaching the crucial $60,000 mark. The market sentiment has turned increasingly bearish, driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and a recent surge in selling pressure. This shift has seen Bitcoin struggling to maintain higher levels, triggering anxiety among investors and traders. As the bears take control, the $60,000 threshold becomes a focal point, with many watching closely to see if the crypto asset can find support or continue its downward trend. With the help of technical indicators, this analysis focuses on analyzing Bitcoin’s current price action and its impact on the asset’s future focusing on the 4-hour and the 1-day timeframe. As of this writing, the market capitalization of Bitcoin is over $1.2 trillion, with a trading volume of over $17 billion. The cryptocurrency price is now down 3.11%, trading at roughly $62,334. Despite a 3.09% decrease in market capitalization, there has been a 96.46% increase in trading volume over the last day. Current Market Overview For Bitcoin Currently, as it can be observed on the 4-hour chart the price of Bitcoin is actively bearish and has hugely dropped below the $64,515 support level. It can also be noticed here that the price is dropping toward the $60,158 support level. Also confirming the above claim is the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) as the signal line of the indicator has sharply dropped below 50% and is currently trending at the oversold section. This indicates that there is a chance of further price decline. Bitcoin’s price on the 1-day chart is also actively bearish as it is presently trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) dropping towards the $60,158 support level with strong bearish momentum. Lastly, with the formation of the 1-day RSI, it can be suggested that BTC’s price poses more of a threat to extending its decline as the signal line of the indicator having dropped below 50% is actively trending close to the oversold zone. Key Support Levels: Why $60,158 Matters Presently, BTC is dropping toward the $60,158 support level. Two possible events may occur if the price reaches this level, either it experiences a rejection and begins to move upward or it breaches this level and continues to move downward. Therefore, if there is a rejection at the $60,158 support level, BTC may start moving upward toward the $64,515 resistance level. If this level is breached, the crypto asset may experience more price growth toward the $71,909 resistance level and possibly other levels above. On the other hand, if the price of BTC breaks below this support level, it will keep falling to test the $56,524 support level. Should this level be broken, Bitcoin might decline even further, testing the $50,604 support level and perhaps even lower levels.

42407984,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8eEw,1719222371,"Don't Tell Anyone, but Private Blockchains Handle Over $1.5T of Securities Financing a Month","Financial technology consultancy Broadridge says it handles $50 billion a day of repurchase agreements involving big banks on its permission-only DLR platform.  Europe-focused securities finance private blockchain firm HQLAx says its platform can save banks as much as 100 million euros ($107 million) a year.  The multitrillion-dollar repo market is the lifeblood of funding in capital markets.  Tokenization enthusiasts in both crypto and traditional finance might be surprised to hear that well over $1.5 trillion worth of repurchase agreements and other forms of securities financing are executed monthly using private blockchains.  While this is a sliver of a highly fragmented, multitrillion-dollar market, these private blockchain loops are being employed at a decent scale by many of the world’s biggest banks and institutions, easily dwarfing the much-hyped tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) associated with open chains like Ethereum.  Indeed, it could be argued these permission-based, under-the-radar repo ledgers are some of the most successful applications of blockchain technology in existence because repo – where cash is borrowed against securities, often highly liquid Treasuries, with an agreed buy-back date and price – is the lifeblood of funding in capital markets.  Wall Street titans like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are reluctant to share specific data when it comes to areas like repo trading. JPMorgan reportedly processes up to $2 billion of transactions a day on its Onyx blockchain, which allows its clients to “settle repo transactions worth billions of dollars within minutes, using smart contracts to tokenize and deliver cash and collateral on a single ledger,” Nikhil Sharma, head of growth at Onyx Digital Assets, said in an email.  There’s more visibility into the hundreds of billions in live repo transactions some of the systemically important banks are aggregating on tech consultancy Broadridge’s Distributed Ledger Repo (DLR) platform, which handles $50 billion in repo volume a day and is used by the likes of Societe Generale, UBS, HSBC and Chicago-based trading giant DRW. Another prominent player is Europe-focused HQLAx (the acronym is for high-quality liquid assets).  Interoperability everywhere  As well as clocking up significant volume, these platforms are also building cross-chain interoperability and integrating bank-grade cash settlement tokens. Last week, HQLAx, which is built using R3’s enterprise-grade Corda ledger and includes HSBC, BNY Mellon and Goldman on its platform, completed a delivery versus payment (DvP) repo settlement with London-based startup Fnality, a provider of institutional-grade digital cash built on a permissioned version of Ethereum.  Last month, Broadridge’s DLR, built using Canton Protocol, a smart-contract ledger created by Digital Asset, became interoperable with JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, which also runs on a privacy-focused fork of Ethereum. DLR is also used Commerzbank, with more banks soon to be named.  “Working with JPM Coin, on the cash side, is probably the largest digital-cash initiative in the world, and we are probably the largest collateral initiative in the world,” said Horacio Barakat, head of digital innovation at Broadridge, in an interview. “So working together towards that interoperability is very important.”  Goldman Sachs' global head of digital assets, Mathew McDermott, points to inefficiencies in conventional repo and securities lending markets brought about by years of layering and fragmentation.  “DLT has the potential to significantly improve existing processes and create new markets like intraday repo and intraday FX so it's fantastic to see the success of platforms such as Broadridge’s DLR and HQLAx as they continue to grow and scale,"" McDermott said in an email, using an acronym of digital ledger technology.  ‘Spaghetti mess’  To those involved in securities financing, blockchain has always looked like a killer application. An “incredible spaghetti mess” is how HQLAx CEO Guido Stroemer describes the vast tangle of securities that need to be physically moved around so big banks can meet their collateral obligations. This complexity leads to banks buying expensive excess collateral buffers, dealing with occasional settlement failures and time lags that result in intraday counterparty credit exposure.  “We believe that relieving those headwinds can save banks between 50 million euros ($54 million) and 100 million euros per year, and we actually think that’s conservative,” Stroemer said in an interview. “We can enable the banking industry to transfer ownership of securities to the collateral obligation of choice, without actually moving them from the custody locations where they are.”  Stroemer expects HQLAx volumes to reach into the high tens of billions by the end of the year. “We have a very strong pipeline of volumes that institutions are planning on putting on the platform. Over time, we expect to have a market share of roughly 400 billion euros to 500 billion euros of activity that stays on the platform,” he said.  Gateway drug?  Given that tokenization is firmly entrenched in the crypto mindset, it will be interesting to see how these closed loops feed into the public blockchain meets TradFi narrative. Although it primarily flies under the radar, Broadridge’s intraday repo business may have the best product market fit in all of the tokenization space, said Rob Hadick, general partner at VC firm Dragonfly.  “These types of on-chain products are going to become the norm for Wall Street,"" Hadick said in an interview. ""That said, it’s unclear how this might translate into any value accrual for public chains and the broader crypto economy. There’s an argument that it could be a ‘gateway drug,’ so-to-speak, but that requires a lot of belief.”  Yes, there could be a transformative scenario where native securities are issued on a public network and settled with open digitized cash, said Broadridge’s Barakat. But, he said, that requires regulatory changes, and there's the natural risk aversion that comes with incorporating new technology, particularly something as disruptive as using a public blockchain for transacting repo.  “If you wait for that to happen, then you miss out on a lot of the immediate opportunities that are there today, which is where private and semi-private networks are popping up,” Barakat said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/24/dont-tell-anyone-but-private-blockchains-handle-over-15t-of-securities-financing-a-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa6071502c26654c46db7f3a7f628b5a6787e4a5-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407993,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8efO,1719222196,Ether Traders Buy $4K Calls In Anticipation of Record High,"A ton of buying activity observed in ether $4,000 calls expiring in September.  The bullish flow is consistent with elevated volatility expectations.  Catching a falling knife is risky, but some crypto options traders look to be doing just that, betting on a bullish outcome in a falling market.  Ethereum's native token ether {{ETH}}, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped over 5% to $3,350 in one week, according to CoinDesk data. The decline follows speculation that ether ETFs could begin trading in the U.S. next month and is consistent with weakness in market leader bitcoin and other alternative cryptocurrencies.  Still, according to Amberdata data, some traders have been buying large numbers of ether September expiry call options at the strike level of $4,000 on crypto exchange Deribit.  A call option is a derivative contract that gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at a specified price within a predetermined time frame. When traders purchase call options, they do so with the expectation that the price of the underlying asset will rise above the strike price, that is, $4,000 in this case, before the expiry of the option.  ""Looking at the block flows this week, we see a ton of buying activity for the September $4,000 calls,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said, adding it is a sign of traders betting that ""if ETH gets above $4k we likely test and breakout new all-time-highs.""  Block trades are large orders typically negotiated privately between two parties and listed on an exchange. They are commonly preferred by institutional investors, hedge funds, and large market participants.  Ether, which came into existence in 2015, set a record price of over $4,800 since November 2021. While BTC surpassed its 2021 early this year, ether only briefly managed to top the $4,000 mark, with the upside relatively restricted due to regulatory uncertainty and low odds of ETH getting a spot ETF listing in the U.S.  Since then, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has set the stage for a spot ether ETF approval and dropped an investigation into Ethereum 2.0, removing significant regulatory uncertainty from the market. Now, Bloomberg's ETF analyst Eric Balchunas expects ether ETFs to begin trading in the U.S. on July 2.  Perhaps traders buying $4,000 calls expect fireworks once the ETFs go live. The bullish flow is consistent with the elevated volatility expectations in the ether market. However, some observers, including JPMorgan, aren't buying the excitement.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/24/ether-traders-buy-4k-calls-in-anticipation-of-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21a3116c49d35c25a967b210a61e3ac9e3d93a8e-4029x2266.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gox said it will start distributing assets stolen from clients in a 2014 hack in July 2024, after years of postponed deadlines.  The repayments will be made in bitcoin and bitcoin cash, and could possibly add selling pressure to both markets.  Defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said Monday it will start to distribute assets stolen from clients in a 2014 hack in the first week of July, years after continually moving deadlines.  “The Rehabilitation Trustee has been preparing to make repayments in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash under the Rehabilitation Plan,” trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi said in a Monday statement posted on the Mt. Gox website.  “The repayments will be made from the beginning of July 2024,” Kobayashi said, adding that due diligence and certain safety steps will be required before the payments go through.  The repayments are largely considered to add selling pressure to bitcoin {{BTC}} markets as early investors will receive assets at a much higher value than their entries before 2013, making them inclined to sell at least a part of holding, traders said.  Mt. Gox was once the world’s top crypto exchange, handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions in its early years. In early 2014, hackers attacked the exchange, resulting in the loss of an estimated 740,000 bitcoin ($15 billion at current prices). The hack was the biggest of the many attacks on the exchange in the years 2010-13.  Trustees have put together a repayment plan that has been in the works for several years, and received a deadline of October 2024 from a Tokyo court last year.  In May, the exchange moved over 140,000 BTC, worth around $9 billion, from cold wallets to an unknown address in 13 transactions for the first time, marking the first on-chain wallet movements for the first time in five years.

A quarter of respondents said they had a positive impression of digital assets.  The preferred allocation to crypto was between 2%-5% of AUM, investors said.  Nomura (NMR) and its digital asset subsidiary Laser Digital found that over half of Japanese investment managers they spoke to plan to invest in digital assets in the next three years following a survey of institutional investors.  The survey showed that 54% of respondents intended to invest in crypto in the next three years and 25% of firms said they had a positive impression of digital assets.  Crypto was viewed as a diversification opportunity by 62% of those surveyed, together with cash, stocks, bonds and commodities, and many investors view digital assets as an investment asset class, the study said.  The preferred allocation to digital assets was between 2%-5% of assets under management (AUM), investors said, and nearly 80% said they would invest over a year.  The development of new products could boost investment in digital assets. For those already involved in cryptocurrencies or those debating investing in digital assets, the main driver for future investment was the development of new products including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investment trusts, and staking and lending offerings. The survey showed that about half of respondents would like to invest directly in Web3 projects or via venture capital funds.  Still, barriers to entry are preventing some managers from investing in digital assets. These barriers include counterparty risk, high volatility and regulatory requirements, the study showed.

29886761,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626070,1719217855,"Will Ethereum Skyrocket? Crypto Analyst Predicts $6,000 By September","Popular crypto analyst degentrading (@degentradingLSD) has made a bold prediction that Ethereum will reach $6,000 by September 2024. This prediction comes in response to an analysis by Mechanism Capital founder Andrew Kang, who expects Ethereum to underperform despite the imminent launch of US spot Ethereum ETFs. Andrew Kang’s analysis projects a continued downtrend for ETHBTC, with the ratio expected to range between 0.035 and 0.06 over the next year. In his detailed thread on X, Kang expressed skepticism about Ethereum’s potential, despite the ETF launch being just days away. Why Ethereum Could Reach $6,000 By September Degentrading, however, presented a counter-argument in a thread on X. Degentrading begins by examining the change in CME open interest (OI) from pre-ETF days to the present, noting a substantial increase of approximately $5 billion. He explains, “Pre-ETF, it was very onerous to perform cash and carry on CME due to margin requirements. Hence, the upper bound of basis trades is probably capped at that amount.” This insight suggests that the advent of the ETF could significantly ease trading constraints, potentially unlocking a large influx of capital. However, he tempers this by discussing the challenges posed by the extinction of prime brokers like Genesis, which complicates spot borrowing as a hedge against CME futures longs. According to degentrading, “Unless market makers can frequently charge a bid/ask spread, they are effectively locking in a loss. Therefore, the sheer amount of CME basis trades has to be a minority. I would peg the figure at $1-2 billion max.” This leaves an estimated $7 billion in potential inflows, a figure he describes as “highly dependent on assumptions.” Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Records Surge In Active Addresses – Incoming Price Rebound? Degentrading contrasts Ethereum’s position with that of Bitcoin, criticizing sentiments from analysts like Eric Balchunas. “Nothing in traditional finance is as exciting as tech. Bitcoin has the branding of digital gold or millennial gold. Gold’s market cap is approximately $15 trillion,” he notes. In contrast, Ethereum is seen as a decentralized global settlement layer or world computer, with the US stock market already valued at $50 trillion. This, he argues, sets a much higher ceiling for Ethereum. He further explains that in his discussions with traditional finance (tradfi) professionals, there is more enthusiasm for ETH and even SOL compared to BTC. “People are much more excited about ETH or SOL for that matter. Hence, I would peg the inflow conversion rate at half of Bitcoin’s, which translates to about $3-4 billion into ETH,” degentrading asserts. One of the key points in degentrading’s argument is Ethereum’s relative illiquidity compared to Bitcoin. He highlights that while Ethereum is roughly one-third the size of Bitcoin, its liquidity is only about 10% of BTC. “This means that an influx of $3-4 billion will materially move ETH,” he emphasizes. This illiquidity could lead to significant price movements with relatively smaller capital inflows. Addressing the market’s current positioning, degentrading points out the overall bleak sentiment on Crypto Twitter (CT), viewing it as the best technical setup for Ethereum. He notes, “On the cusp of the ETH ETF launch, you have people setting expectations for $500 million of inflows over six months. This is the BEST technical setup for ETH.” Related Reading: 3 Reasons To Invest In Ethereum, 1 To Stay Bitcoin-Only: Bitwise CIO An important factor in degentrading’s analysis is the anticipated conversion of Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. He suggests that ETHE will likely face much less selling pressure compared to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) due to a lesser lender overhang. “ETHE will also likely face MUCH LESS selling pressure than GBTC because of the much lesser lender overhang,” he notes. Impact Of Cash And Carry Trades Andrew Kang responded to degentrading’s analysis, highlighting the involvement of large funds like Millennium, which owns $2 billion of the ETF. Kang points out that such funds engage in basis trades and are not long-only investment funds. “Millennium by itself owns $2 billion of the ETF. They are not a long-only investment fund. They do these types of basis trades. That’s only one fund from an old filing,” Kang stated. Degentrading acknowledged this but emphasized the cost implications of holding a cash and carry position. He argued that the cost of holding such positions nets out significant amounts, which impacts the market maker’s profitability. “On that thought, the cost of holding a cash and carry would net out $300 million to Millennium and cost the market maker that amount, implying that the delta is borne by a naked delta on the futures,” degentrading retorted. At press time, ETH traded at $3,362.90.

However, Ali’s short-term bearishness is countered by Alex Clay’s long-term bullish perspective. Clay, another crypto analyst, sees a bullish “Cup and Handle” pattern brewing on the charts. This pattern, historically a friend of bulls, suggests a continuation of the uptrend after a consolidation phase. The analyst further strengthens his bullish case by pointing to TON’s recent breakthrough of a major resistance zone, which is now expected to act as a springboard for further gains. #TON/USDT Update $TON is consolidating above the broken supply zone👀 More upside is coming📈 https://t.co/ORgEnPEO7t pic.twitter.com/LdwXBg2W6u — Alex Clay (@cryptclay) June 23, 2024 Toncoin’s Technicals Whisper Of Further Ascent Clay doesn’t stop at mere pattern recognition; he throws down some serious price targets. Based on the measured move of the Cup and Handle pattern, Clay predicts TON reaching a cool $10.50, with an even more ambitious target of $11.60. Zooming into the one-day chart, technical indicators paint a similar picture. The price faces resistance around $7.65, a level it’s tested multiple times. If TON can muscle through this hurdle, the next stop could be a glorious $8.28. The 100-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) at a supportive $6.01 further strengthens the bullish case, acting as a safety net if a correction does occur.

42407987,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8eVT,1719211966,Bitcoin Tumbles Toward $62K as Crypto Bulls See $150M in Liquidation,"Major tokens experienced a significant drop of up to 7.5% in the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin losing 3% and other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana also seeing declines.  The decline led to the liquidation of over $150 million in bullish bets, attributed to factors including large sales from Bitcoin miners, the German government moving a significant amount of BTC to exchanges, and the broader market sentiment influenced by these movements.  Major tokens slid as much as 7.5% in the past 24 hours as bitcoin {{BTC}} reversed last week’s gains causing over $150 million in bullish bets to be liquidated over the weekend.  Bitcoin lost 3%, while ether {{ETH}}, Cardano’s ADA, and BNB Chain’s BNB registered similar losses. Solana’s SOL dropped 7% to trade at nearly $120 on Monday morning, while meme coins dogecoin {{DOGE}} and shiba inu (SHIB) dropped nearly 5%.  The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), which tracks major tokens minus stablecoins, slumped just over 4%.  The move caused longs, or bets on higher prices, to record more than $150 million in liquidations. Shorts, or bets against, saw a relatively smaller $9 million in losses. Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin.  Some funds attributed the losses to large sales from Bitcoin miners and reactive sentiment to a German government moving a significant amount of BTC to exchanges.  “Miners have been under tremendous pressure to sell given higher breakeven prices post-halving,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast over the weekend. “Miner BTC holdings have dropped to the lowest level we've seen in the past 14 years, with total reserves lower by 50,000 from the start of the year.”  “The market has also been spooked by the emergence of a new large pool of supply. The German government allegedly sold around 3k BTC in the last few days with 47K more to go,” it added.  As previously reported, bitcoin whales—or entities with large holdings of the token—sold over $1 billion worth of BTC in the first two weeks of June alone. The German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), which had seized almost 50,000 BTC from a piracy site in 2013, started moving tens of millions worth of BTC to crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken last week.  Monday’s drop extends one of bitcoin’s worst weeks so far this year. BTC prices have generally suffered in the past few weeks amid $1 billion in sales from large holders, dollar strength, and a strong U.S. technology index market.  U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded over $1 billion in net outflows last week, data shows.

42407999,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8f2X,1719210459,Bitcoin's Double Top Suggests BTC Could Fall to $50K: Analyst,"The U.S. election and CPI could be a bullish factor later this year.  Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, due Friday, could offer relief.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has carved out a double-top price pattern, signaling a potential bearish trend change ahead of key data release that could influence the Fed's interest rate path.  Bitcoin's price journey has been a rollercoaster this month. After surging to nearly $70,000, approaching the all-time high of March, it has now retreated to $63,000, decoupling from Nasdaq's continued move higher, largely due to faster selling by miners, profit-taking by investors near lifetime highs, and outflows from the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds.  The price action has formed a double top, a bearish technical analysis pattern comprising two peaks with a valley in the middle, usually appearing after a notable uptrend. The second peak represents uptrend exhaustion, with the eventual breach of the low hit between the two peaks confirming a bearish trend change.  ""Technically, bitcoin appears to follow a double top formation, whereas the support level is being tested. This chart formation should be our base case unless it becomes invalidated. This formation could easily see a drop to $50,000—if not $45,000,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said.  ""Yes, the U.S. election and CPI should be bullish later this year, but we can still have a steeper correction,"" Thielen added.  However, the Fed's preferred inflation yardstick, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for May, is expected to show the slowest monthly advance in the core figure in over three years. That would cement the case for renewed Fed rate cuts from September, potentially putting a floor under risk assets, including bitcoin.  ""[Recent] Strong economic data has forced [bond] yields higher and precious metals lower on Friday.

SOL price started another decline, dropping nearly 10%, and now the bears aim for more downsides. SOL price remained in a bearish zone below the $142 resistance against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $130 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $130 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend losses if there is a close below the $122.50 support zone. Solana Price Takes Hit Solana price attempted a recovery wave above the $132 level. However, SOL bears defended upsides above the $135 level and the price started another decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $130 and $125 support levels. A low was formed at $123.24 and the price is currently trading in a downtrend. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $130 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $130 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, the price might face resistance near the $126.50 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $136.65 swing high to the $123.24 low. Immediate resistance is near the $128.50 level. The next major resistance is near the $130.00 level or the trend line. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $136.65 swing high to the $123.24 low. A successful close above the $130.00 resistance could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $132.50. Any more gains might send the price toward the $136.50 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to recover above the $130.00 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $123.50 level. The first major support is near the $122.00 level, below which the price could test $120.00. If there is a close below the $120.00 support, the price could decline toward the $112.50 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 20 level.
