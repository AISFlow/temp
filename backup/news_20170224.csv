42427398,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMVh,1487968743,Unanimous Vote Advances Blockchain Bill in Arizona Legislature,"Lawmakers in the lower chamber of Arizona’s legislature have unanimously advanced a bill that enshrines blockchain signatures and smart contracts under state law.  HB 2417 was introduced earlier this month by by state representative Jeff Weninger. According to public records, two committees in the Arizona House of Representatives unanimously approved the bill, with both caucuses giving their support as well.  On 22nd February, the House voted 59-0 to pass the bill, with one representative not voting. Yesterday, the measure was formally submitted to the Arizona Senate.  The bill notably included language regarding smart contracts, or self-executing contracts built on a blockchain, stating:  “Smart contracts may exist in commerce. A contract relating to a transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely because that contract contains a smart contract term.”  The Arizona bill’s success mirrors that of a blockchain study bill being advanced by two lawmakers in Hawaii. That proposal, which seeks to study how the tech can be used to benefit the state, unanimously passed the lower house Hawaii’s legislature earlier this week.  Elsewhere, however, legislation focused on the tech hasn’t been so successful.  In North Dakota, lawmakers put the brakes on a proposal to study bitcoin regulation after it had initially cleared the state legislature’s upper chamber. On 23rd February, public records show, the state’s Industry, Business and Labor Committee Committee recommended that the bill should not pass in its current form.

42427401,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMbh,1487958603,Sprint to Test Blockchain Platform for Connecting Telecoms,"US telecom Sprint is working on a new blockchain initiative focused on carrier applications.  The firm is partnering with SoftBank, a Japanese telecom conglomerate, and TBCASoft, Inc., a blockchain startup based in California. Sprint is the fourth-largest telecom provider in the US, according to data from Statista, after Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile.  For now, it appears the partnership is still in its early stages, as the three companies said today that joint trials won’t begin until June, leveraging a platform developed by TBCASoft to connect the telecom’s systems together.  Sprint confirmed the partnership when reached, with a representative telling CoinDesk:  “We entered this partnership with SoftBank and TBCASoft as part of our mutual interest to understand the full potential of blockchain to improve carrier-to-carrier interactions and, ultimately, end-user enhancements to further simplify transactions for customers.”  Sprint is by no means alone in its work on blockchain among the world’s telecoms.  A number of firms in the space have sought to obtain patents related to the tech in the past two years, including AT&T, British Telecommunications PLC and Verizon.  Like Sprint, some telecoms have sought collaborative efforts around blockchain. Swisscom AG, which is state-owned, became a member of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain project in December, and UAE-based Du joined Dubai’s Global Blockchain Council last year as well.  Others, including France-based Orange, have moved to invest in the space directly.

Cloudflare, which provides denial-of-service protection, detailed the issue in a blog post published today. The company was first contacted about the bug last week by Google cybersecurity researcher Tavis Ormandy.  The so-called ""Cloudbleed"" bug – a reference to 2014's Heartbleed vulnerability – is believed to have begun affecting services as early as September 2016, enabling the leak of memory that included sensitive information such as passwords and authentication tokens. The firm said the bug has since been patched.  News of the bug has triggered warnings from exchanges like Poloniex and Kraken, which suggested that users change their passwords, two-factor authentication and API keys. More broadly, cybersecurity advocates have strongly encouraged users of any site that utilizes Cloudflare to change their passwords as a precaution.  According to Cloudflare’s blog post, the real threat to users came as a result of some of that information being captured by search engines.  The firm explained:  “The bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it had been cached by search engines. We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence. The greatest period of impact was from February 13 and February 18 with around 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests through Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage (that’s about 0.00003% of requests).”  A user on GitHub has curated a list of sites potentially affected by the bug, which includes industry services like Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain and LocalBitcoins.  Other major websites, including Reddit, Uber and OKCupid, are said to be affected as well.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42427396,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMTh,1487950283,Malta's PM: The Rise of Cryptocurrencies 'Cannot Be Stopped',"European regulators should embrace cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the prime minister of Malta argued in a speech yesterday.  Speaking at the CEPS Ideas Lab in Brussels on 23rd February, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat argued that governments in the European Union should ""double down"" on the tech, which he pointed out is slowly catching on amongst the bloc’s financial institutions, according to a transcript published by Live News Malta.  Muscat's remarks were in the context of reinvigorating the EU, which has faced rising socio-economic pressures in recent years. He also proposed that leaders in the bloc create financial mechanisms to invest in areas that may be inclined to leave the EU, as was with the case of the UK's so-called ""Brexit"" vote last year.  Though prefacing his statements by saying that he is opting to advocate for ""outright insane"" sounding ideas, Muscat argued that ""the rise of cryptocurrencies can be slowed but cannot be stopped"".  He went on to tell event attendees:  ""My point is that rather than resist, European regulators should innovate and create mechanisms in which to regulate cryptocurrencies, in order to harness their potential and better protect consumers, while making Europe the natural home of innovators.""  Among the firms in Europe testing the tech is Malta’s primary stock exchange, which in December formed an internal ""Blockchain Committee"" dedicated to exploring how the exchange might utilize the tech.  The exchange further indicated its intention to set up a domestic blockchain consortium in Malta, aimed at creating a basis for the development of new applications.

42427389,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMFh,1487948494,"'Buy Bitcoin,' PwC Fintech Director Tells Fordham Students","Representatives from each of the 'Big Four' global auditing firms were in attendance yesterday at New York's Fordham University to discuss blockchain in the capital markets.  There, members of Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PWC joined blockchain startup ConsenSys to discuss the future of the industry and to provide career advice to students on the cusp of beginning their professional careers.  While no companies provided new insight into their public strategies, their off-the-cuff remarks shed light on how traditional financial institutions are becoming more comfortable with the increasingly nuanced technology.  When given an opportunity to address the crowd, Subhankar Sinha, a PwC fintech director, told students that the best way to get involved in the industry is to buy and hold bitcoin and ethereum.  Sinha told the crowd:  ""Buy it with your own money. That will give you a tremendous dividend. You have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations. Have an open mindset.”  Positive predictions  Elsewhere, there was discussion about how the industry might evolve.  An introduction from Fordham professor Dr Frank Hsu outlined the history of blockchain, drawing analogies to the TCP/IP protocol – an internet technology developed in 1983, but that did not gain mainstream adoption until 1995.  ""Using that framework, blockchain, started in 2008, should gain mainstream status by 2020,"" he said.  Panelist Chris Broderson, Capital Markets researcher at Accenture, focused on healthcare, stating that cryptographic technology will allow medical records to be easily stored and transferred via blockchain applications while also reducing fraud.  Finally, panelist Vanessa Grellet, an ethereum executive and chair of Nexus Impact Investing Group, predicted that blockchain will disrupt the legal, financial services and remittance industries.  She ended with an appeal to students: ""Follow your passion, doing something you love, stick with something for two to three years to build expertise and knowledge in your field.""  And stressing the passion that those in the industry have for the technology, panelist and EY financial services manager Mike Maloney said:  ""Nobody gets in Twitter fights over Swift and ACH.""

42427394,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMRh,1487945353,Edinburgh University Partners with IOHK on Blockchain Research Hub,"Scotland's University of Edinburgh is partnering with blockchain startup IOHK on a new research lab dedicated to the technology.  Announced today, the research initiative will become part of the university’s School of Informatics, its chief educational hub for computer science and software engineering.  Aggelos Kiayias, a cryptography professor at the University of Edinburgh who joined IOHK as its chief scientist last October, will spearhead the research center, working with undergraduate and PhD students, as well as academics, on a range of blockchain-related research projects.  Kiayias said in a statement:  “Distributed ledgers is an upcoming disruptive technology that can scale information services to a global level. The academic and industry connection forged by this collaboration puts the Blockchain Technology Lab at Edinburgh at the forefront of innovation in blockchain systems.”  The goal is to have the Edinburgh outfit fully staffed by this summer, according to the startup, which was co-founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of the co-founders and the first CEO of the ethereum project.  The Scottish facility is the second blockchain lab set up by IOHK, which launched its first in partnership with the Tokyo Institute of Technology earlier this month. IOHK and Tokyo Tech have been working collaboratively on blockchain since mid-2016, according to press materials.  Additional research hubs are planned for launch over the comings months, according to the firm.

42427404,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMjh,1487943011,New Ethereum Proposal Aims to Supercharge Smart Contracts,"Newly released research shows that top-layer networks, usually trumpeted as the future of bitcoin and ethereum scaling, might actually be capable of more than boosting blockchain transaction volume.  The proposals, while relevant for any blockchain, however, are uniquely relevant for ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain. Touted as a 'world computer', its need for scaling is pronounced – with such ambitions, it needs to scale not just payments, but a richer array of smart contracts.  One new project now believes it can help with that problem.  At EDCON 2017 this week, Ledger Labs head of technology Jeff Coleman put forth a way of abstracting state channels that he believes would work for use cases beyond payments.  ""Today, I want to talk about something a little more advanced,"" he said, introducing his idea.  Coleman, a long-time researcher of the subject, continued:  ""Initially a lot of the things people were talking about with state channels were focused around financial applications. I’m more interested in how we can take that idea bigger, and do things that are more complicated in a practical way.""  As off-chain payment channels are a multi-faceted technology, Coleman’s idea is a part of a swathe of research aimed at enhancing the top-level layer of blockchain networks. Yet, it comes at a time when many similar ideas are beginning to be announced.  Coleman's talk marked the second time this week researchers have proposed revisions to the technology.  Channel wish list  The idea behind off-chain networks, or 'state channels', is that, in the future, it's likely to be too costly to settle most transactions directly on a blockchain. Instead, they'll be executed on a separate network layer connected to a blockchain that uses a cryptographic technique known as 'hashed time-lock contracts'.  This design initially gained traction with the release of the bitcoin Lightning Network white paper in 2015, and the authors of the Raiden Network later ported the idea over to ethereum.  According to Coleman, it's possible to build state channels for specific applications right now on ethereum, but with some difficulty. That’s a problem that Coleman wants to avoid by nailing down an implementation that works for a variety of applications, not just one specific type.  In his talk, Coleman listed at least half a dozen criteria that he considers ethereum channels should ideally have. For example, the technology should be trust-free, use on-chain storage as rarely as possible and be ""parallelizeable"", meaning that users should be able to pay for multiple goods at the same time, rather than just be restricted to one channel.  Further, they should not reduce privacy and should limit the so-called 'griefing factor', ensuring that bad actors can't spin the rules to strategically make others unfairly lose money.  Oversized scope  Coleman's ambitious proposal intends to help with all of the above problems, and he wasn't above poking fun at the sizeable scale of his talk.  ""My goal is to use the biggest words of all the presentations today,"" he joked of the project name ""counterfactual instantiation"".  Still, he kept his conversation grounded, describing the project in simple terms.  ""We're going to use incentives to make the two parties act as if the contract was already in the blockchain. That’s the basic idea here,"" Coleman said.  By using these incentives, users can act as if their smart contracts are added to the blockchain, even if that isn't really the case. Parties can kick the contract to the blockchain if they need it, but the hope is that they won’t unless there’s a security concern, or if they worry that the other party is trying to cheat.  They are incentivized not to do so, though, with fees and penalties, echoing elements of another talk given by ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin.  Coleman went on to joke that it's kind of a psychological phenomenon, and that the off-blockchain contracts are ""in our collective imaginations"" – but this effect would allow smart contract operations without really committing them to the blockchain.  Future consensus  While some might be skeptical of these remarks, there is consensus that such 'counterfactual instantiation' is a way forward for ethereum smart contracts.  ""The technique has been discussed at length with several of the teams currently working on ethereum state channel implementations. All are in agreement that the concept can be executed securely,"" Coleman told CoinDesk.  He explained that it's supposed to work for most applications that require state channels, and the payments can cross over to other underfunded channels.  For example, say a user has two channels open, one for a video streaming service and one for ""renegotiating a financial instrument in real-time"". If the video channel then runs out of money, this state channel would know enough to fill itself up by dipping into the financial instrument channel.  It will take some time to get to that point, however.  ""Months more work will be needed to make it truly simple to use in applications,"" Coleman said, though he pointed out that there’s already a ""partial implementation"" underway that’s available for educational purposes.

42427410,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMnh,1487937614,'Top 10' Blockchains Report Concludes: Now is the Time to Pivot,"Research and advisory firm Aite Group is preparing to release a detailed comparison of what it deems the 'Top 10' distributed ledger platforms suited for securities settlement.  After eight months of research, including lengthy interviews with each of the platforms included, the report's author Javier Paz has crafted a side-by-side analysis complete with defining characteristics, ranging from the project's consensus mechanism to business model.  At the end of the 80-page report, Paz draws a series of conclusions for sectors including regulators and cloud providers.  But, Paz reserves his sternest conclusion for financial technology vendors not yet dealing in distributed ledger, or as he calls it, elsewhere in the report, 'chaintech'.  ""Blockchain hype is high,"" he writes. ""But the threat to traditional fintech vendors is real.""  Paz continues:  ""This is the time for vendors to pivot and decide whether to acquire or develop relevant blockchain technology, years before a vendor’s client feel that a move to blockchain technology is required.""  Path to profit  Platforms selected based on their potential to more quickly and transparently conduct post-trade securities settlement include Axoni, Chain, Digital Asset, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Nasdaq, R3, Setl, Symbiont and tØ.  The report details how each of the firms earns money, or intends to earn money. Most plan to give away the building blocks of their services for free as part of various open-source licenses.  While giving enterprising companies the ability to build solutions from scratch, the startups will charge licensing fees to use the application layers they themselves have built.  Of the 10 firms, only Hyperledger and the Ethereum Foundation do not provide development teams to potential customers for a fee, instead relying on third-party consulting firms to help potential users build with the code.  But what is not mentioned is the price.  ""Buyers and sellers discover the equilibrium price for that new thing after a good deal of haggling and window shopping,"" Paz writes. ""Similarly, neither chaintech vendors nor their target audience has a perfectly clear sense of what should be the price tag for the new service.""  Another notable side-by-side comparison is the consensus mechanisms employed by each of the groups.  Of the numerous criteria, only Digital Assset, ethereum and Setl are not marked with the category ""nodes using confederated consensus"".  ""A growing trend, adopted by five chaintech platforms and spearheaded by R3,"" writes Paz, ""calls for consensus taking place at the transaction level, requiring the consent of at least two counterparty nodes.""  In conversation with CoinDesk, Javier Paz admitted that, in part, the exercise of aggregating so much data was part of his own personal attempt to better understand the technology.  But other than for his own gratification, Paz says the report is aimed at C-suite executives, regulators and platform developers themselves, who he believes might become so focused on their own projects that they lose sight of the competition.  For the report, Paz sifted through oral interviews, written responses, and schematics provided by 30 senior executives from 16 blockchain firms, four financial market utilities and others in search of the comparison points.  He estimates that the methodology could cut down on a reader’s learning curve by between one month and three months.  The full report is due out later this month.

42427405,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMlh,1487934014,Do You Believe in Blockchain Magic?,"Sebastien Meunier is a financial services advisor and startup mentor with 15 years of experience in business transformation and innovation in finance.  In this opinion piece, Meunier takes a look at the many optimistic claims made for applications of blockchain, arguing that over-promising on the tech is not the best way forward.  Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that is a force for good.  You probably heard that it can help solve problems in charity. But did you know that you can end homeless hunger with blockchain? Actually it could help end poverty in all its forms, including solving the child poverty issues!  Blockchain is unbelievably powerful. Bitcoin, the first blockchain system, launched in 2009, can help end war, which is already something. But blockchain technology is even stronger: it will make guns smarter, preventing gun deaths, and save the world from nuclear holocaust. Boom.  Let’s be clear, blockchain will completely revolutionize how we run the world. It will undo populism bigly, stop climate change, prevent the next financial crisis, disrupt Uber, give us control of our data, and transform everything from banking to government to our identities.  The democracy will be on a blockchain. Your company will be on a blockchain. Even Chinese pork will be on a blockchain!  No industry shall be immune to the blockchain revolution:  Blockchain will make banks disappear (by 2026 in case you wonder)  Blockchain will transform our cities  Blockchain will underpin our future energy system  Blockchain could completely transform the music industry  Blockchain is the glue that binds the Internet of Things  Blockchain can help fight cyberattacks  Blockchain will transform the practice of law  Blockchain will transform media and entertainment  Blockchain will change accounting business  Blockchain could fight voter fraud  Blockchain can disrupt healthcare in 5 ways  Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the supply chain  Imagine! If we had invented it earlier, blockchain could have prevented:  The DNS’s denial of service attack  Soros leaks  The biggest corruption case in Brazil’s history  The Wells Fargo scam  Lehman Brothers  Can blockchain be more than a peace agent as well as an infinite source of food and wealth? Yes! Blockchain has recently become a source of life with the announcement of the birth of Plantoids, the first blockchain-based artificial life forms. Congratulations!    _______________________________________    The section above was made from actual headlines.  At this point you probably understand that there is too much hype around blockchain or 'distributed ledger' technology.  Handling the hype  Readers: learn how to recognize snake oil, avoid ecstatic articles and white papers and preferably read and share balanced ones.  Blockchain technology is complex. Business problems are complex. An article about blockchain for business should be measured and not straightforward.  Writers: resist the temptation of sensational headlines for 'clicks'. Control your excitement and present all aspects of a story, not only the concept (we could trade loans and securities without intermediaries!), but also the reality (regulation, legacy, etc).  Publishers: prioritize balanced articles, challenge the writers, and if you publish opinion pieces, make sure you give voice to a variety of experts on your platform.  A realistic view  Blockchain technology is no magic, it is basically a combination of two existing technologies: public key infrastructure and protocols.  Immutable databases already exist (eg HDFS, couchDB). PKI systems (signature, encryption, etc) already exist. P2P systems already exist. Consensus protocols already exist (eg paxos, raft).  You don’t necessarily need 'blockchain' to implement these features. The two differentiators of DLT are, in my opinion: (a) the control of the read/write access is truly decentralized and not logically centralized as for other distributed databases, and corollary (b) the ability to secure transactions in competing environments, without trusted third parties.  Blockchain is not a general-purpose solution for everything. It should be considered as an enabler to creating new decentralized services and solving specific business problems (such as the double-spend problem in trustless P2P environments for the brilliant bitcoin).  Keeping promises  That said, many business processes are inefficient and heavily centralized.  Blockchain technology could be a solution for some of them, but other technologies could be as well – for instance, I can think of several ways to optimize a claim management process without using blockchain.  That being said, I do believe that blockchain technology can be very powerful for some specific use-cases. I have met promising startups and seen advanced proofs of concept at the banks I work with.  Now let’s keep in mind that change is not only about technology: If you want to revolutionize financial services, you have to turn everything around from market regulations, organization and governance, to business models and operational processes!  It may happen, but it won’t happen overnight.  In the meantime, you can still use cryptography and data replication protocols to develop incremental innovation – that’s perfectly fine as long as you don't over-promise.
