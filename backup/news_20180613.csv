42429215,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsQzh,1528924504,Sell-Off Over? Bitcoin's RSI Just Hit Its Lowest Level Since 2016,"Signs are beginning to emerge that bitcoin's sell-off today may be overextended.  After hitting a 70-day low of $6,133 on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) hit a level (26.4) last seen in August of 2016, according to data from the Bitfinex exchange.  The relative strength index, or RSI, is used for identifying overbought and oversold conditions of an asset by ""comparing the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period to measure speed and change of price.""  When such levels are hit, the indicator suggests price action is approaching a level below the asset's true value, where a price bounce tends to occur.  BTC/USD rarely hits oversold levels (<30) in the daily time frame, but when it does, price has historically performed well for the bulls.  February 6th was the last time RSI levels were below 30, and at that time, prices rallied from $6,000 to $11,788 in just two weeks, resulting in a ~96 percent gain.  Prior to that, on August 14th, 2016, BTC registered an RSI level just above 26 when the price showed $563 on Bitfinex. Even through today, the price of bitcoin has not gone below $563 and current levels represent a ~980% price increase.  But while the oversold indicators tend to signal downtrend exhaustion, bulls might want to still proceed with caution before celebrating as bitcoin's daily RSI has reached lower levels.  According to Bitfinex data, the lowest level recorded since 2013 was 16.1 on August 18th, 2015.

42429200,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsQZh,1528921816,Former Telegram Employee to Launch Crypto Token Platform,"A new cryptocurrency trading platform launched by former Telegram director of special projects Anton Rosenberg seeks to help blockchain startups stabilize their token prices.  Mikado, a crypto derivatives trading platform, will provide a solution for projects planning an initial coin offering (ICO) but which want to avoid the price collapse that occur when an open sale begins and early investors drop their tokens, Rosenberg announced Tuesday. He told CoinDesk that ""many companies who are doing ICOs are trying to get investors' attention by big bonuses and discounts without a understanding how it will affect the price after the ICO.""  Unlike traditional financial markets where underwriters and market makers are helping companies to structure their IPOs, ICO markets don't have institutions and mechanisms to plan a gradual release of liquid tokens, so Mikado will do this job instead, Rosenberg said.  Mikado is going to issue a derivative for any tokens that are locked up, such as bonus tokens for early investors or tokens that are distributed among the project's employees to stimulate their work. The project can transfer these locked tokens to a specially created escrow account, and investors will receive derivative Mikado tokens (MKT) instead which can be sold. After the lock-up period is over, the MKT tokens will be burnt and their holders will receive equivalent amounts of the original tokens they invested in.  ""Locking up coins is a convenient tool, but not very efficient,"" Rosenberg said. ""They can plan several lock-up periods, gradually release their tokens and control the trading volume. Mikado is promising a tool to create a ""stable commodity-based economy"" on the crypto market.  Mikado does not plan to launch a public initial coin offering for its own token, in order to avoid having MKT classified as a security, said chief executive Andrey Nayman. That being said, the firm intends to conduct a closed token sale. Right now the project is applying for a distributed ledger technology (DLT) license in Gibraltar. After, the company plans to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The historic summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un got the crypto community's attention – and held it – thanks to Dennis Rodman and the notorious cryptocurrency that funded his travel to Singapore, potcoin.  CoinDesk reported on June 7 that retired basketball star Dennis Rodman was headed to Singapore for the Summit with the help of the marijuana-themed cryptocurrency. As a celebrity who have visited North Korea several times, Rodman's trip was considered as ""a celebrity twist"" to the historical geopolitical event.  According to The Washington Post, Rodman was ""in discussions with"" the team behind potcoin last week to get financial support for the trip. He later officially confirmed the news on Twitter highlighting the fact his trip was sponsored by the group:  In fact, it is not the first time that potcoin has helped Rodman with his travels.  Just last year in June, the former Chicago Bulls star went back North Korea through potcoin's sponsorship. At the time, the price of cryptocurrency spiked as Rod announced the news on Twitter in a ""potcoin"" t-shirt and a baseball cap.  Launched in 2014, potcoin claims it is ""the first digital currency created to facilitate transactions within the legalized cannabis industry"" on its website. By which, it means that it gives marijuana dispensaries and farmers an alternative to other financial institutions like a bank when they trade.  And that leads us to the day when we have Rodman, crying, on CNN from Singapore wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat, and it makes the crypto world look no worse than ever.  Oh yeah, he was also wearing a potcoin shirt.  Good for potcoin?  Shawn Perez, a potcoin spokesman, told The Post that the trip would be a ""peace mission,"" but many suspected it was purely a trip to promote potcoin's brand.  ESPN reporter Darren Rovell tweeted that the advertising Rodman garnered for potcoin in the moment was worth $4.1 million.  2018 jumps the shark?  For most of Twitter users, though, it was just a weird moment that is really, really, really hard to digest.  As it is now, the price of potcoin, which is ranked No. 315 on CoinMarketCap, spiked in the last 24 hours, according to ConMarketCap's data.

Blockchain startup Swarm announced Wednesday that it was launching new ""equity tokens"" that would represent equity in notable blockchain startups like Coinbase and Ripple – but those companies have pushed back swiftly against the idea.  The ""blockchain for private equity"" company published a blog post describing its new token project, with chief executive Philipp Pieper explaining in a statement that the tokens ""democratize investing"" and allow ""any Swarm investor [to] hold equity in some of today's most prominent tech startups.""  In a statement, a spokesperson for Swarm told CoinDesk that the ""tokens are company equity either from vested options or from venture capitalists,"" explaining that the equity comes from ""approved secondary market transactions to acquire vested employee shares, or from venture capitalists who have directly acquired equity from these companies.""  Yet when reached for comment, representatives for Coinbase and Ripple struck sharply critical tones – and in the case of Coinbase, a cease-and-desist has already been sent, according to Swarm, resulting in an updated announcement that removed all references to Coinbase.  ""As a private company, Coinbase does not allow trading of stock on secondary markets for a variety of reasons, including the fact that there is not full and equal information available to the market. We will take appropriate action if we find people have sold Coinbase shares in violation of our agreements not to do so,"" Coinbase told CoinDesk in a statement.  Though there's no indication that a cease-and-desist letter was sent by them, a representative for Ripple issued a similar rebuke.  ""We have never spoken to Swarm, don't have a record of them purchasing Ripple equity and would not have approved a purchase for this purpose,"" the rep said.

Under the proposed legislation, this would be extended to ""a person that accomplishes a violation...by altering a record made utilizing distributed ledger technology.""  The legislation doesn't offer any specific examples of what this means, nor is it clear what, exactly, spurred the creation of the bills.  Another piece of legislation offered up this month in Michigan applies similar changes for crimes involving credit cards.

42429216,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsR1h,1528903649,Relief Rally Ahead? Litecoin Looks Oversold Below $100,"Litecoin may have hit fresh 2018 lows Wednesday, but could be in for corrective rally courtesy of oversold conditions.  The world's sixth-largest cryptocurrency fell to $93 at 15:10 UTC, the lowest level since Dec. 8, and is currently trading at at $95.80 on Bitfinex, down 9 percent in the last 24 hours.  The 48 percent drop from the May high of $182 has turned the tide in favor of the bears. However, the sell-off looks overdone as the daily relative strength index (RSI) has nosedived into oversold territory (below 30.00) for the first time in over two months.  Hence, LTC could revisit $100 (major psychological hurdle) in the short-run before resuming the drop towards $80.  Daily chart: RSI  Currently, the RSI is hovering at 26.00, indicating oversold conditions. So, the sell-off may run out of steam in the next 48 hours or so.  LTC/BTC Shorts  Interestingly, LTC is looking oversold at a time when short positions on Bitfinex exchange are at the highest level since Oct. 12.  Usually, such extreme market positioning is considered a sign that a trend is nearing exhaustion. So, a short squeeze could be in the offing and could lift prices above $100.00.  That said, the broader outlook would still remain bearish as indicated by a pennant breakdown in the long-duration charts below.  Weekly chart  Daily chart: Moving averages  As of writing, LTC is trading well below the 50-day moving average (MA), 100-day MA and 200-day MA, indicating a long-run bearish setup. Also, corrective rallies will likely be short-lived as long as the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south in favor of the bears.  View  The short-term oversold conditions could pave way for a minor corrective rally to $100 (psychological hurdle) and possibly to $106.  The long-run outlook remains bearish, so LTC will likely test $80 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 2015 low to 2017 high) over the next few weeks.  Only a weekly close on Sunday (as per UTC) above $120 (pennant floor now acting as resistance) would abort the long-term bearish view.

John Griffin and Amin Shams, of the University of Texas at Austin's Department of Finance, published a study Wednesday linking the stablecoin with bitcoin's prices during the 2017 price increases. The published study states that the researchers used ""algorithms to analyze the blockchain data, we find that purchases with tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in bitcoin prices.  This produced a clear link between the printing of new tether tokens and bitcoin's price increases following bear runs, the study claims, stating:  ""By mapping the blockchains of bitcoin and tether, we are able to establish that entities associated with the Bitfinex exchange use tether to purchase bitcoin when prices are falling. Such price supporting activities are successful, as Bitcoin prices rise following the periods of intervention. These effects are present only after negative returns and periods following the printing of tether.""  However, the two notably discovered that it does not take a large amount of tether to prop bitcoin's price - ""even less than 1 percent of extreme exchange of tether for bitcoin has substantial aggregate price effects,"" the study said.  The algorithms the two developed were able to ""cluster groups of related bitcoin wallets,"" according to the study. This allowed the researchers to map how tether was distributed, and how it impacted bitcoin prices. The study explains that ""tether is created, moved to Bitfinex, and then slowly moved out to other crypto-exchanges, mainly Poloniex and Bittrex.""  It continued on to note that generally, the token is not redeemed by the issuer, ""and the major exchange where tether can be exchanged for USD, Kraken, accounts for only a small proportion of transactions.""  The study focuses primarily on the supply-based explanation for the link, but the researchers also note that the demand for bitcoin can create a similar demand for tether, particularly by investors who cannot move large sums of money into cryptocurrency directly.

According to research published by U.S.-based market intelligence firm Greenwich Associates on Tuesday, amid the general increase, 10 percent of the surveyed banking institutions reported that their budgets for areas such as blockchain research and product development had grown to $10 million or more in 2017.  Furthermore, the report said 14 percent claimed to have already deployed a blockchain solution. Meanwhile, Greenwich Associates found that the shift from proof-of-concepts to live production is expected within the next two years in over 75 percent of the projects.

42429211,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsQrh,1528891214,Surprise KYC: Investors in Tezos' Troubled ICO Might Finally Be Fed Up,"Tezos, the blockchain project that sought to fix crypto's broken governance models, is at the center of talk about how to handle decentralized politics – just not in the way its founders had hoped.  On Sunday, the Tezos Foundation announcedhttps://tezosfoundation.ch/news/tezos-foundation-announces-kyc-aml/ that it would be carrying out know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) checks on investors who bought into its July 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). At that time, investors, who the foundation calls ""contributors,"" were not asked to provide any personally identifiable information when they bought $232 million worth of its crypto tokens – dubbed tezzies (XTZ) – making Tezos the largest ICO ever completed up to that point.  But now, as the blockchain industry has matured, ""it has become best practice to verify that contributors meet basic KYC/AML criteria,"" the Tezos Foundation announcement said.  A third party, U.S.-based TokenSoft, is handling the checks, and according to one Reddit user who said they'd completed the KYC/AML compliance, the check asked for a name, phone number, address, government-issued ID and a selfie.  And this news has enraged many investors.  ""If they wanted to do KYC/AML compliance they should have said so as part of the initial offer,"" wrote one Reddit user in response to the announcement. ""Changing the deal after the sale has been completed for months is bad business, no matter how they try to dress it up.""  Part of the frustration is likely that this is just the latest obstacle standing between Tezos investors and their tokens.  The blockchain launch, which would unlock the tokens for investors, was delayed for months after a spat between Tezos' founders, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, and Tezos Foundation president Johann Gevers broke out less than three months after the ICO. Yet, even after the Breitmans' seeming victory, with Gevers stepping down from the foundation in February, there wasn't an immediate launch of the blockchain.  As such, investors have been waiting for over a year since Arthur Breitman wrote – in May, before the token sale – that an early-2018 launch was ""entirely within the realm of possibility,"" if it even took that long.  And although Tezos' current timelinehttps://tezosfoundation.ch/news/preparing-launch-tezos-network/ for the beta launch is set by the end of the second quarter 2018, with the new KYC/AML process, some investors who are unable to complete the verification or refuse to now worry the won't ever receive their tezzies.  And with that, some investors are getting quite irritated. Echoing a common sentiment (in terms that weren't even especially hostile), one Reddit user said:  ""Just refund our goddamn money!""  Best practice?  CoinDesk reached out to the Tezos Foundation asking about refunds of investors' bitcoin and ether, but did not receive a clear response.  Instead, a spokesperson said the foundation would ""follow blockchain ecosystem and industry best practice"" in carrying out the KYC/AML checks. Neither the announcement nor an accompanying FAQ explained what would happen to investors' funds if they did not complete the checks.  While traditional financial services providers must carry out KYC/AML checks on customers, Matt Gertler, general counsel at Digital Asset Research, finds the foundation's justification for following newly refined industry consensus on ICO procedures unconvincing.  ""The rules haven't changed,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It's not that KYC/AML has become the norm, you either had to do it or not.""  Timothy Draper, a venture capitalist who has provided financial backing for the Tezos protocol and Dynamic Ledger Solutions (the Breitmans' company, which controls the still-proprietary code behind the network), was more forgiving, telling CoinDesk:  ""It is a dynamic regulatory environment. I am sure the team has weighed all options.""  And other Reddit users came to the project's defense. One wrote, ""You're buying tokens. You need to do KYC on any exchange for that.""  But because many investors are contending that the project's goal of decentralization clashes with its insistence on collecting data, some might decline to hand over their personal information. In that case, Gertler said, recission, or bringing the parties back into the position they were in before they made the contract, would be a reasonable approach.  Yet, the Tezos Foundation may not agree.  The ICO's terms  state that contributions were not investments, but actually ""non-refundable donation[s]."" The terms further warn of regulatory risk, and even state, ""The contributor understands and accepts that TEZOS [the Tezos Foundation] cannot guarantee that contributors shall have any allocation of XTZ when the TEZOS Network is created.""  On top of that, contributors are required to waive the right to sue any entity associated with the Tezos network.  However, that has not stopped plaintiffs from filing four lawsuits against the Tezos Foundation, the Breitmans, Dynamic Ledger Solutions and others associated with the project. And, with that, there's no guarantee that Tezos' terms will hold up to legal scrutiny.  Going rogue  Those terms might worry many investors and outside observers, but apparent differences of opinion among the Tezos ranks could also cause anxiety.  For instance, on Reddit Arthur Breitman appeared to disavow the decision to conduct KYC/AML checks – posting ""Not my call,"" in response to another user's call for clarity. After another user shot back, stating that Breitman is a founder and it's distressing that he doesn't have any ability to make a decision on his project, he merely posted, ""Agreed.""  Kathleen Breitman declined to comment on the news.  But there are not only whispers of unrest within Tezos, but also from the outside – in the form of a fork.  While crypto true believers make all sorts of asseverations on social media, a number of industry observers, including ethereum creator and crypto heavyweight Vitalik Buterin, have begun to advocate a Tezos hard fork. Hard forks have become a popular way for opposing camps within a cryptocurrency community to part ways, splitting the blockchain in two and creating an alternate cryptocurrency in the process.  ""This seems backwards,"" Buterin wrote on Twitter, adding: ""Why can't third parties just run a script to scan the BTC/ETH blockchains, see how much everyone contributed, calculate how much XTZ everyone should get, and generate the genesis block without Tezos Co involvement? That's how the Ethereum launch worked.""  Buterin even went so far as to provide a script program that would carry out the plan.  Still, that's just talk; but at least one group of disgruntled Tezos fans actually plans on executing a fork.  A developer going by the name yellow_snake has set up a website and social media channels for nTezos, which the group describes as an ""instantiation of Tezos"" that is independent from the foundation and is instead self-governed, with no KYC/AML checks. The group will give accounts the same allotment of tezzies as they had initially on the Tezos blockchain (with the exception of the Tezos Foundation, which will get nothing).  Speaking about the Tezos Foundation, yellow_snake told CoinDesk, ""As a well-defined legal entity with a lot to lose, it is an easy-target which can act as a pressure point on the network. I think the people at the [Tezos Foundation] act in good faith. But it is clear to me that they are in the wrong position to launch the network.""  He continued, ""This is what nTezos is aiming for: an independent and self-governing network of computers running the Tezos software.""  Still, the group, and any others that are interested in forking off the original blockchain, will likely have to wait till the beta launch, since unlike many blockchain-related projects, Tezos' code is under Dynamic Ledger Solutions' control, to be released as open-source software after the launch.  Yet, that doesn't seem to be influencing yellow_snake's insistence on forking Tezos.  Instead, speaking to many Tezos investors' feelings, the developer concluded:  ""The KYC was a breaking point for a lot of us. It is a breach of trust, an invasion of privacy and … it compromises Tezos' core value-proposition as a potential safe-haven for property rights.""

42429214,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsQxh,1528885535,Bitcoin Bulls Eye $6K Bottom After 4-Month Low,"Bitcoin is still looking south, having hit four-month lows today, but the bearish momentum may wane due to short-term oversold conditions, the technical charts indicate.  More bears joined the party in the U.S. session Tuesday after the cryptocurrency failed to cross twin resistance at $6,859 (50-hour moving average (MA) and 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). As a result, the price fell to $6,370 on Bitfinex today, the lowest level since Feb. 6. At press time, bitcoin was slightly higher at $6,453.  The drop to the four-month low has bolstered the already bearish technical setup and raised the odds of a sell-off to $6,000 (February low).  However, the bears may take a breather over the next day or two, as the relative strength index (RSI) is hovering at the key bullish reversal zone, and bitcoin could hold around support at $6,400 or possibly see a minor corrective rally.  Daily chart  Currently, the RSI is holding below 30.00. Historical data shows BTC stages a ""V""-shaped recovery every time the RSI drops to or below 30.00. However, things may pan out differently this time, as long-term technical charts are biased to the bears.  Weekly chart  The downside break of the pennant (bearish continuation pattern) indicates scope for a drop below the February low of $6,000.  Further, on the weekly chart, the RSI fell below key support of 53.00 in February, signaling a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and is currently hovering below 50.00 (still in bearish territory). Clearly, the bears now have more say in determining the BTC/USD exchange rate.  So, while the cryptocurrency may make a brief rally, courtesy of the oversold conditions, a major recovery will likely remain elusive.  View  Longer term, BTC is still eyeing a drop to $6,000 amid a generally bearish market.  In the next 48 hours, bearish momentum may weaken and prices could revisit the 5-day MA, currently located at $6,800.  The probability of a major ""V-shaped"" recovery is low.  Only a daily close above 10-day MA, currently seen at $7,214, would signal bearish invalidation.

According to a report from the Securities Times, an outlet of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, JD Finance established the trial in partnership with Huatai Securities, a brokerage firm that will underwrite the issuance, as well as Xingye Bank, which will act as a trust.  JD Finance aims to issue the securities using a consortium blockchain that will see each party act as a node, recording the transactions in a transparent manner. The experiment sets out to ascertain if the blockchain can meet the demands of the various parties involved in the asset securitization process, such as issuers, underwriters and buyers.  The financial services firm first rolled out its traditional, non-blockchain ABS product in 2015, as well as an online service that helps other companies to raise capital through their issuance. This typically comes in the form of a portfolio of loans or credit card debts that can be further traded on the secondary market.  According to a local news source, the firm issued an automobile loan in August 2017 using a blockchain platform, marking the firm's initial trial in incorporating distributed ledger technology to its financial services.  JD.com also announced in April that it will launch a proprietary blockchain-as-a-service platform this year, in line with other tech giants including Huawei, Oracle, IBM and Microsoft.

42429176,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsLLh,1528876826,EOS's Experimental Launch Might Be Putting Investor Money at Risk,"Who do you trust with your private key?  That's the question that may be on the minds of EOS token holders, who while incentivized to help the much-anticipated technology finally go live, haven't yet done so. As EOS is set up to enable self-governance by its users, it's these individuals and companies who have to make the first move, electing who they'd like to process transactions that occur on the network in an elaborate global vote.  But at the time of writing, they haven't exactly done that. Rather, EOS's blockchain is locked in a middle ground between ""launched"" and ""live"" that rests on the willingness of users to complete that process.  The issue is that, to vote, users have to prove they hold their tokens, a process that requires the use of their private keys, sensitive cryptographic strings that prove they own their funds, and if lost, would be gone forever. As such, it seems that while users are eager to take part, they are nervous that the tools that would enable them to vote might put their holdings at risk.  ""The biggest 'miss' in EOS launch is the failure to understand that retail EOS investors will be reluctant to vote with their private keys on the line,"" one EOS user wrote on Telegram.  As detailed by CoinDesk, the only voting software that has been subject to third-party security review is CLEOS, a command-line tool issued by the creators of EOS, Block.one. However, due to the degree of technical competency required to interact with the tool, many EOS token holders have been forced to opt for less trusted software.  Indeed, across community forums, distrust in third-party software created for EOS is matched only by the confusion faced by users engaging with the voting process.  While several pieces of software have been produced to address the issue, some are voicing concerns about the lack of third-party security auditing. Plus, there's the risk of scams and attacks that can intercept even the most honest developer effort.  ""Whenever something is too complicated for people, then bad actors appear which try to exploit those weaknesses,"" Krzysztof Szumny, the lead developer of a voting tool called Tokenika, told CoinDesk.  That said, there's some evidence that such concerns could be contributing to the slow-moving voting, which is, in turn, contributing to the sluggish start of the EOS experiment. At the time of writing, a mere 37.35 percent of the 150 million necessary votes to get the blockchain running have been cast.  As one EOS user on Telegram wrote:  ""Pretty sure I'm not the only one who's waiting until there's 100 percent safety in terms of putting private keys into new wallets.""  Security spectrum  Backing up, it's helpful to understand why private keys are needed to cast votes on EOS in the first place.  A private key is required with the use of any of the EOS voting software for two reasons – verifying the vote is legitimate and correlating that vote to a users' holdings, which is used to determine the weight of a vote.  ""Your private key is required to vote whether you are voting from a wallet, a command line tool or anywhere else. No one can bypass this requirement,"" said Yudi Levi, CTO and co-founder of Bancor, a blockchain project whose large ICO wrapped in June 2017 and is vying for a block producer candidate spot.  Bancor has also developed a voting tool for the new blockchain called LiquidEOS.  Essentially, using a private key for the voting process equates to transaction signing – where the same type of signature required in order to send a standard crypto transaction is needed.  However, the question boils down to in what way the private key is exposed.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Alexandre Bourget, co-founder of block producer candidate and voting software provider EOS Canada, said the current voting tools are on a spectrum of security, from trustworthy to extremely high risk.  On the one hand, there's command-line tools, like CLEOS, in which private keys have a minimal risk of exposure. As software adds code to provide user-friendly interfaces, it becomes increasingly hard to secure. Plus, the closer the code gets to the internet, the higher the chance private keys will be intercepted.  ""You have websites that will ask you to put your private key in and do things with it,"" Bourget told CoinDesk, adding:  ""They might be perfectly legit but this is a big, big risk because we've seen time and time again websites that were very well-intentioned but got hacked.""  And it's notable considering EOS token holders are in a sensitive phase. Bourget emphasized that the majority of EOS users have come straight from the token crowdsale and probably haven't reconfigured the access control to their EOS accounts. Or put another way, while it's possible to create multiple private keys to manage an account, for now, most users' tokens probably all correspond to one private key.  For hackers, this adds a significant incentive on phishing that alphanumeric string.  Best practices  That said, there are ways in which EOS holders can protect themselves when voting.  For instance, Bourget suggested that users reconfigure EOS account settings to generate a private key that could be used for vote signing but which isn't link to the actual wallet itself.  While there's limited documentation for how to do this, Bourget hinted that EOS Canada may create a video explainer soon. Until then, though, there are several simpler measures that users can undertake.  Bancor's Levi said, ""Use a downloadable voting tool that runs locally on your machine and outside the browser where votes are susceptible to manipulation by toolbars, botnets and other bad actors.""  Plus he encourages people to utilize tooling that has been produced by established companies, saying:  ""Established brands have more to lose.""  For example, while open-source voting tools like Scatter, Greymass, LiquidEOS and EOS Canada's ""EOSC"" have not been third-party audited, each company or project behind those applications has made an effort to limit the degree of private key exposure and carefully document these processes.  And as mentioned, because private keys are more susceptible to theft when they're used online, Tokenika has designed a tool that generates the vote offline, only connecting to the internet to publish the record of the vote.  ""For maximum security, we strongly encourage people to never use their private key on a device while being online,"" Tokenika's Szumny told CoinDesk.  Although, there's always still a chance that users will have malware active locally on their device.  ""Knowing the source of the binaries and who built it are very important, because there are risks, and it's cold catch, it's easy to just get away with it,"" Bourget told CoinDesk.  As such, Szumny warned EOS holders not to experiment, to be diligent about the use of their private keys and to take part in the voting process slowly so as not to make quick mistakes.  The developer concluded:  ""It is important to vote rather sooner than later, but it is more important to not make any mistakes in the process.""

42429186,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsLdh,1528862416,Quantstamp Under Fire: Buyers Say Faith Shaken In $65 Million Token,"A blockchain project is facing an uproar from community members who say the team has been undermining the value of the token it used to raise millions.  The controversy around Quantstamp, maker of a protocol that seeks to decentralize smart contracts auditing, reached a fever pitch late last week, with acrimony spilling into the project's social channels. There, representatives for the San Francisco-based company, registered in Delaware, took heated questions from token buyers.  At issue is Quantstamp's acceptance of U.S. dollars and ether, rather than its token, QSP – which it used to raise a little over $30 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) last November – as payment for smart contract audits it has performed.  In that offering, the company exceeded a targeted $11 million by $9.5 million, raising $20.5 million from an initial round. The remaining $9.5 million was sold through a public crowdsale. So far, 65 percent of those issued QSP tokens, out of a 1 billion supply, have been distributed.  Quantstamp raised the funds under a Reg-S exemption, one that seeks to cover U.S. entities raising funds abroad, according to a December filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  But Friday's discussion showcases that token owners are beginning to question the degree to which both QSP and the company's own technology have been involved in the 484 audits Quantstamp claims to have completed, according to its website.  Documents obtained by CoinDesk indicate that the company has accepted ether (ETH) for services in one instance and priced its offerings in U.S. dollars in another, practices that appear to have run afoul of user expectations, with some claiming this clashes with practices they believe the company said it would pursue.  ""We are concerned that you guys don't need the token to grow in value for your company to succeed as a payment for manual audits,"" James Chun wrote in the Quantstamp project's Telegram group on June 10.  The same day, another user in the group, who goes by the handle ""Carine,"" framed the concern this way:  ""As a token holder, we only benefit from those willing to hold and find value in the token. If the use case is unclear, this will not translate to increased ROI.""  Compounding the issue for these users is that the company wouldn't say how frequently it has accepted payment in a currency other than QSP.  ""Communication of the percentage of audits paid in QSP or USD would clear a lot [of] things up,"" a third Telegram user, ""Gato,"" wrote June 11. But ""for now it seems like [a] really vague story.""  In a statement to CoinDesk, Quantstamp said, ""from the start we've been following the roadmap put forth in our initial white paper."" The company declined to answer numerous other questions on the record.  Pricing of services  Stepping back, however, it's worth noting that in spite of user complaints there remains a real need for the kind of project envisioned by Quantstamp.  Founded by Richard Ma and Steven Stewart, both software engineers, Quantstamp cited in its white paper attacks on smart contracts in which hackers were able to steal millions as the motivation for starting the effort and raising funds. Underscoring the idea's appeal, last November, Quantstamp announced its participation in the Y Combinator class of 2018, a prestigious accelerator program which provides startups with seed funding.  But, an open question token buyers now seem to be raising is whether the company's decisions are economically aligned with their interests as well as the project's original design.  Like most decentralized projects, Quantstamp not only envisions that certain actors necessary to its launch will become less important over time, but that a central entity is needed to bootstrap the idea until its management can be given completely to users.  ""On the matter of open sourcing our codebase, that has always been the long-term goal because how else can the community take over the project?"" co-founder Stewart said June 10 on the Telegram thread. ""But, my present stance is that the codebase must reach a certain level of maturity first.""  This may be contributing to impressions held by users that Quantstamp's acceptance of the token is key to its current, and perhaps future value, but public statements as to the relationship between the company and its tokens are limited.  In a review of Quantstamp's public Twitter and Medium messages, as well as its ICO terms and conditions, the company doesn't seem to have ever explicitly stated that it would accept only QSP tokens for audits. However, until the public grilling Friday, the company hadn't indicated that it would accept U.S. dollars and ETH (though its white paper carves out room for exceptions).  ""No person is bound to enter into any contract or binding legal commitment in relation to the sale and purchase of the QSP tokens and no cryptocurrency or other form of payment is to be accepted on the basis of this white paper,"" it states.  Elsewhere, language on the Quantstamp website seems to hint at reasons for the confusion.  The company's ""Request a Full-Service Audit Form,"" available online, only includes an option for users to pay in QSP tokens, specifically stating that ""QSP tokens are required to power audits"" and that users ""must hold a minimum of 200,000 QSP to request an audit.""  According to the company's published materials, users are meant to trade QSP to pay for, receive and improve verification services within the Quantstamp network.  This means bounty-hungry bug fixers receive QSP tokens from contract creators, as do code contributors verifying the Solidity programs used to implement the contracts, and validators running the Quantstamp validation node.  Software use  Also at issue, though, is whether token holders accurately understand the state of development as it relates to Quantstamp's core technology.  While Quantstamp has been conducting audits, and publicizing its alleged success in performing the service, the protocol the company raised funds to build is far from complete.  According to a timeline in the original white paper, Quantstamp isn't expected to begin using its own protocol to conduct audits until late 2018. However, this schedule suggests it was meant to begin work on its smart contract insurance with partners in June. To date, it remains unclear how much of the company's technology has been built.  And it's important to note, any tokens that would power such a protocol may not currently exist. QSP, as it stands, is a token that runs on the ethereum protocol. The company has not decided whether it will swap those tokens for new ones when its network is up and running, and the white paper does not address this question.  Quantstamp said in its statement to CoinDesk:  ""This is a major decision and something we are spending time and resources on to determine the best course of action for our business, investors and community. At the appropriate time we will make a corresponding announcement.""  Still, the company has also been faulted by users for using open-source tools developed by competitors, namely Mythrill and Oyente, to conduct the audits, rather than the technology it claims to be developing.  Stewart confirmed on the Telegram channel that it is doing so, saying, ""Yes, the web product uses Oyente, an open source project that we have also contributed [to]."" To which a user going by the handle ""aplitt"" responded, ""In that case, I believe that fact should have been disclosed, proper attribution should have been given, and it should have been offered without charge.""  One possible explanation is that the current audit service is a separate activity from realizing the vision in the white paper, undertaken to generate revenue. Indeed, this is not an unheard-of practice among startups, one that helps them to keep the lights on while they embark on long-term infrastructure building.  But if so, that was not made clear to many users, who had interpreted the firm's April 30 announcement of a ""live working product"" as a sign of progress on Quantstamp's proprietary technology.  Public grilling  But if user sentiment has been building against Quantstamp, its representatives appear to be doing little to defuse the situation.  Founder Richard Ma, who also describes himself as Quantstamp's ""Chief Caring Officer"" on his Medium page, joined the company's Telegram thread at 23:00 UTC Friday to speak to investors, beginning communications that lasted for nearly an hour and a half.  There, he was greeted with pointed criticisms of his short, sometimes vague responses. One frustrated Telegram user, Ryan Edmondson, asked, ""Is this a soliloquy or a Q&A from people who really need answers?""  When Ma told the channel to reference the white paper for more information, another user sarcastically asked, ""How can we read your whitepaper when you are rewriting it?"" in a message that was subsequently deleted.  After receiving a volley of questions along the same lines, Ma finally admitted that U.S. dollars and ether were accepted for audits in certain cases.  ""Any USD or ether proceeds that we receive instead of QSP for manual audits support our overall mission to innovate in order to secure smart contracts,"" he said.  ""Some customers can't buy QSP to pay us, which means that we miss out on the opportunity to be helpful and stay true to our mission of driving smart contract adoption for the ecosystem,"" Ma continued. ""Other times, when the audit is very important for the community, such as the Binance audit, we audit at little or no cost, as a service to the wider community.""  From the thread, it seemed that Quantstamp was conducting some of its auditing for ""little to no cost"" in the case of cryptocurrency exchange Binance (which hired the firm to audit listed ERC-20 tokens), some in exchange for QSP tokens and some in exchange for dollars or ether depending on the customer.  However, when Ma was repeatedly asked what proportion of revenue was split between audits done in exchange for QSP tokens versus other currencies, he simply responded, ""I can't talk about any of this stuff.""  Frustrated users on the Telegram thread continued the conversation over the weekend, and it was still going strong at press time.  Ma's statement that some customers can't buy QSP points to a possible defense of Quantstamp's policies: because it never offered tokens to U.S. buyers, it has been unable to accept that method of payment when rendering its services to domestic customers.  What next?  Apart from Quantstamp's technology and token economics issues, a third complication plaguing the startup is a handful of recent employee departures.  These have also sparked suspicions of turmoil at Quantstamp on its associated Telegram thread.  ""We restructured the team to help us in the next stage of product development,"" said Ma when asked about the matter by concerned users.  He named three employees – two engineers and a UX designer – who he said were laid off for performance issues. ""It's a startup company - sometimes we need to fire people if they don't perform well. But as a startup company – we will also build, and we will hire good people and deliver."" As of Tuesday, the company website listed 29 employees in total.  Yet despite such assurances, the departures have given Quantstamp token holders one more reason to fret.  ""When a bunch of people leave the company not just one or two, it's usually a sign [of] bad company culture or something [like] internal conflicts,"" said Telegram user ""mindcrack.""  Following Friday's contentious digital town hall meeting, the price of Quantstamp's QSP token slid over the weekend as part of a broader rout in the cryptocurrency markets. Late Tuesday afternoon, the token was trading at about $0.10, off from an early-January all-time high above $0.80, according to CoinMarketCap. QSP's market capitalization now stands at $65 million.  Indeed, the decline in crypto prices overall since the beginning of the year has likely contributed to the suspicious sentiment in the Quantstamp community, as one sympathetic Telegram user pointed out.  ""Having to deal with a crypto community in a bear market is hectic,"" wrote Trent Savage. ""If we were at [an all-time high] – even if everything else was the same – you wouldn't have to deal with a hyperventilating community. There would be a lot more 'w[h]en lambo' – 'QSP is great'.""  Nevertheless, a comment from one particularly disillusioned user, aplitt, seemed to capture the overall tone of public sentiment and loss in investor confidence expressed over the course of the thousands of messages exchanged on the company's extensive Telegram thread.  ""I don't think they have any secret sauce or competitive advantage technologically and now they have a big contingent of previously loyal holders who have lost trust because they have misled us about token utility in connection with the manual audits,"" aplitt wrote, concluding:  ""What's left is a broken promise and a sliver of hope. Not good enough for me as an investor.""

42429191,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsLjh,1528858836,A 'Crypto Shopping Mall' Is Being Tested in Slovenia,"A major shopping center based in Slovenia is widening a cryptocurrency payments pilot.  BTC City Ljubljana, located in Slovenia's capital of Ljubljana, will allow a group of 150 people to use cryptocurrencies at 24 businesses located in the sprawling complex, which according to online materials boasts over 500 storefronts. Those include services for clothing and electronics as well as restaurants, Slovenian TV channel ""24 Ur"" reported on Monday.  Despite the seemingly relevant name, there's no relationship between bitcoin and the popular shopping complex, which has been called one of Europe's largest. It first opened in the 1950s before being renamed as the Blagovno Transportni Center – or BTC – Ljubljana.  Earlier this year, the shopping center co-developed the project with startup Eligma, which offers a payment system dubbed Elipay that facilitates transactions in cryptocurrencies by way of a mobile app.  With more than 500 stores on its territory, the shopping center aims to become the first retail hub in the world to accept cryptocurrencies.  The goal to establish a ""Bitcoin City"" in Slovenia as suggested by local reports was supported by the country's leadership when Prime Minister Miro Cerar and the secretary of state Tadej Slapnik visited the center earlier this month, during which Cerar had a cup of coffee bought by Slapnik using cryptocurrency.  Cerar also talked up blockchain last year during a conference appearance. As previously reported, the prime minister pointed to the use of blockchain within public services – a goal his administration was said to be seeking at the time.  ""We are also already laying the foundations for the initial pilot testing of the technology in the state administration,"" he said at the launch of a new think tank dedicated to the tech.
