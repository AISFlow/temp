42412701,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5ow6,1678538629,Bitcoin Regains $20K After $200M in Crypto Liquidations; Some Traders Brush Off USDC Fears,"Bitcoin and ether rose as much as 4% in the past 24 hours after a steep fall on Friday as contagion risks from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank spread to crypto markets, specifically the exposure of USD coin-issuer Circle to the bank.  Ether (ETH) rose over $1,450 while bitcoin (BTC) jumped over the $20,000 mark on Saturday to post early signs of market stabilization. Both tokens fell below strong resistance levels on Friday.  Other cryptocurrencies did not post similar gains, however, suggesting traders were not taking risks on lesser-known tokens yet. Polygon’s matic (MATIC) was up 1.6% while BNB coin (BNB) and XRP were up a nominal 2% in Asian evening hours on Saturday.  Sudden and steep market movement occurred Friday as regulators shut SVB amid a run on the bank. Traders sold their tokens holdings as USDC fell to as low as 87 cents early Saturday, spurring a sell-off.  Total crypto market capitalization fell under $920 billion for the first time since November, while over $200 million worth of crypto-tracked futures were liquidated in the past 24 hours.  Nearly $60 million in bitcoin futures were liquidated, the most among major cryptocurrencies, followed by $40 million in ether futures liquidations. Such liquidators likely contributed to the slide in bitcoin and ether.  Liquidation happens when a trader has insufficient funds to keep a leveraged trade open.  Meanwhile, some market analysts brushed off prolonged USDC fears by pointing to the token’s U.S. Treasury backing.  “80% of their assets are in the form of [6 million] US T-bills,” wrote one Crypto Twitter community member. “85% of these bills have been rolled over in the past 3 months. Interest rate risk is negative.”  Adam Cochran, partner at crypto fund CEHV, said the FIDC-insured nature of SVB suggested fears about the longevity of USDC were overblown.  ""Good comparable for FDIC recovery process – the entity got 62% of balances paid out right away under the FDIC's 'advanced dividend' process, and by final payment had recovered 94%,"" Cochran said in a tweet. ""If similar at [Silicon Valley Bank] then Circle's maximum damage is [$198 million on $3.3 billion].""  Elsewhere, North Rock Digital co-founder Hal Press tweeted that 77% of Circle’s reserves were held in U.S. Treasury bills – citing official documents – meaning that the theoretical floor price of USDC was 77 cents.  “Circle holds 77% of their reserves in 1-4 month T-Bills. These T-Bills are held at BNY Mellon and managed by BlackRock. This provides an absolute floor on USDC of 0.77,” Press said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/11/bitcoin-regains-20k-after-200m-in-crypto-liquidations-some-traders-brush-off-usdc-fears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fde84cadb8f296129e099039722986883421e527-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

USDC traded at 87 cents in Asian morning hours, reaching lifetime lows. It has since rebounded to just over 90 cents as of Asian evening hours.  Some traders bet on a gradual recovery to the $1 mark, buying the relatively cheap USDC for a potential 10% gain should the tokens repeg to the intended dollar mark.  Leverage could potentially magnify returns for traders betting on a recovery. As such, futures funding rates on the crypto exchange Bybit jumped to as much as 0.3% on Saturday morning.  That means traders made as much as 0.3% in fees from their total market position. The funding was paid by traders who shorted USDC, paying over 0.4% to borrow the asset and bet on lower prices.  Some $4 million in USDC futures were liquidated in the past 24 hours, Coinglass data shows.  Elsewhere, Maker’s decentralized stablecoin dai (DAI) also depegged from its intended $1 mark on Saturday amid market stress, CoinDesk reported. It hit an all-time low of 88 cents.  Friday’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) caused a market-wide drop for cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours as traders found some of the industry’s major players had exposure to the bank.  These players included U.S.-based stablecoin issuer Circle held a part of its USDC stablecoin’s cash reserves at Silicon Valley Bank as of Jan. 17, according to the firm's latest attestation.

Lawmakers from both major political parties were present at the meetings with regulators, a person familiar told CoinDesk.

""I am closely monitoring and convening Committee members with regulators so myself and members can understand the latest around the closure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) appointed as receiver. I appreciate the DFPI and the FDIC for taking decisive action today, and I remain confident in America’s financial markets and the ability of our regulators to protect consumers and investors.""  Several California lawmakers tweeted they were also following the situation. One key concern is whether depositors would receive any portion of their funds beyond the FDIC’s $250,000 limit per account.

42412718,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5pA8,1678513883,"USDC Stablecoin Depegs, Crypto Market Goes Haywire After Silicon Valley Bank Collapses","The cryptocurrency crisis went into high gear early Saturday as Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) failure caused some of the industry's core plumbing to go haywire.  Stablecoin prices wildly swung and gas fees soared as investors scrambled to move money around hours after regulators shut SVB amid a run on the bank, which had ties to crypto. It was the second crypto-linked bank to go under this week.  In the aftermath, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened top financial regulators to discuss the collapse of SVB. Not long after, crypto markets went into turmoil, suggesting the more-than-year-long bear market has entered an even darker phase.  There's echoes of the 2008 global financial crisis, when bad news kept getting followed up by even worse news. Though in the case of crypto, which lacks a central bank like the Federal Reserve that can bail out the industry, the question lingers: How will it end?  Read More: U.S. Lawmakers Met With Fed, FDIC to Discuss Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank  Circle Internet Financial's USDC stablecoin massively depegged from its intended $1 price – a harrowing development for a product designed as a place for investors to safely park money. The USDC/USDT pair (which tracks Circle's coin versus the bigger one issued by Tether) sank as low as 87 cents on the Kraken exchange at 07:16 UTC on Saturday – far lower than it ever got amid the market stresses that followed the FTX debacle in November. It was back around 94 cents as of 18:07 UTC.  The financial services company confirmed late Friday that about $3.3 billion of the reserves backing the world's second-largest stablecoin were tied up at SVB.  Read More: Coinbase Pauses Conversions Between USDC and U.S. Dollars as Banking Crisis Roils Crypto  Stablecoins derive their value from those reserves. If one is worth more than $43 billion – as USDC was earlier on Friday – there should be roughly that much cash or cash-like fixed-income instruments stashed somewhere backing that up. USDC's market capitalization has now slumped below $40 billion.  Another stablecoin, MakerDAO's DAI, also depegged from $1.  USDT, meanwhile, at one point spiked to $1.06 on Kraken versus the U.S. dollar as investors appeared to shift money away from USDC. Bitcoin climbed back above $20,000.  Gas fees, which measure how much it costs to complete an on-chain transaction, surged. For Ethereum, the median gas fee jumped as high as about 231 gwei, versus the roughly 20-to-40 range seen earlier Friday, according to Nansen.ai.  Crypto was born in the aftermath of – and, to some, in response to – the 2008 economic crisis. Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin paper debuted into a world where governments had just propped up the financial system by pouring money into it. Crypto lacks such a centralized authority. If SVB customers, including Circle and its USDC stablecoin, are forced to take a haircut on their money, the repercussions are unclear.  So who, if anyone, will step in?  When Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan tweeted late Friday that Twitter should buy SVB and turn into a digital bank, billionaire Elon Musk tweeted in reply, ""I'm open to the idea.""

In a tweet, the crypto exchange said it was ""temporarily pausing"" the conversions while banks are closed over the weekend. The exchange said it planned to restart conversions on Monday.

In its first statement following a day of chaos in crypto's stablecoin sector, Circle declined to specify exactly how much cash is stuck in Silicon Valley Bank. But it said the company and its stablecoin ""continue to operate normally.""  The sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank – the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history – has roiled the startup landscape, which was largely reliant on the tech-friendly lender. But it has also spooked parts of crypto dependent on or tied up in USDC, including decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure such as Curve's 3pool. On some trading venues USDC is trading below its dollar peg.",NEGATIVE,USDC,FIAT | TRADING | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/11/usdc-issuer-circle-says-it-awaits-clarity-from-fdic-on-silicon-valley-bank-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9bfacc43729daed7fb15a2d284673bb17f22de40-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The USDC/USDT trading pair dropped as low as 94 cents on Kraken, the lowest price since April 2021. It recovered to about 98 cents as of 02:54 UTC on Saturday.  USDC is meant to maintain a 1-to-1 peg with the U.S. dollar, but worries about the impact of Silicon Valley Bank’s failure drove it down from $1 on Friday.  An undisclosed portion of USDC’s cash reserves are parked at the now-failed bank, leading to concern that money backing the stablecoin is now stuck. Stablecoins such as USDC are a key part of the crypto industry’s foundation, and when they stray far from $1 (or whatever fiat asset they’re pegged to) that suggests concern about their financial footing.
