According to the announcement, the rise in bitcoin's price and the exchange listing four new crypto assets at the end of last year led to the increase in assets under custody, or the total value of financial assets the firm manages for its clients.  In the period from December 2019 through now, bitFlyer Japan listed XRP (XRP), basic attention token (BAT), Stellar lumen (XLM) and nem (XEM) on its exchange.  CoinDesk Japan reported that, according to latest statistics from the Japanese crypto asset trading industry, the physical transaction volume of domestic cryptocurrencies was down this year: July (in-kind trading) was approximately 604 billion yen, well below the 1.1 trillion yen recorded in July 2019.  Earlier this year, bitFlyer conducted an internet survey which revealed that during the first half of the calendar year most people who opened new accounts with the exchange were in their 20s.  Midori Kanemitsu, a market analyst at bitFlyer, explained in the same report that the attitude towards bitcoin had changed significantly as global monetary easing progressed during the COVID-19 pandemic, shifting the cryptocurrency from an investment target to an asset class that institutional investors can hedge against inflation.

42405140,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLR5w,1602189071,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Surges on Square News to $10.9K; December Ether Options Pile Up,"Bitcoin is flashing green as Square converts some of its cash to crypto while ether options traders are making lots of bets for December expiration.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,890 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,532-$10,962  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price popped Thursday, led higher almost immediately following the announcement that payments firm Square had invested $50 million to purchase 4,709 BTC. The development pushed the price per 1 BTC to as high as $10,962 before settling to $10,890 as of press time.      Read More: Square Puts 1% of Total Assets in Bitcoin in Surprise $50M Investment      “News that Jack Dorsey’s Square has purchased about $50 million worth of bitcoin is a definite positive that appears to have driven markets higher on the back of positive sentiment,” said Guy Hirsch, USA managing director of multi-asset brokerage eToro. “Dorsey has long been an advocate of the largest cryptocurrency, and this move reaffirms his bullish stance, and Square’s.” The stock price of Square (NYSE: SQ) also rose Thursday, in the green 1.8% at the close of trading today.      “Seeing traditional institutional firms such as Square invest into bitcoin to hold on their balance sheet after a publicly traded company such as MicroStrategy purchased $250 million worth of bitcoin as a ‘hedge against inflation’ brings significant credibility to bitcoin,” said Michael Gord, chief executive of trading firm Global Digital Assets. “The CEO of MicroStrategy even went so far as to call bitcoin superior to cash”.      If indeed these investments are a bet against fiat, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), a measure of the greenback versus a mix of other currencies, is one metric to watch. Though it has picked up since a late-August low, it’s still in the relative doldrums for 2020 and was flat, in the red 0.02% as of press time Thursday.      The positive market sentiment has certainly translated into higher-than-average bitcoin daily spot volume. Major exchanges already have $332 million in volume so far Thursday, higher than the $284 daily average in the past month.      While bitcoin volume is up Thursday, volatility remains low. In the options market, six-month at-the-money (ATM) volatility, the difference between option strikes to the price of bitcoin, is at 65%. The last time it was that low was back on July 31.      “The buy pressure from institutional investors is increasing, so we are seeing a nice ramp up,” said Marc Fleury, CEO of Two Prime, a crypto asset management firm. “We seem to be entering an era of a low-volatility bull market.”    Lots of ether options for December expiration    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday trading around $351 and climbing 3.3% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: As DeFi Deflates, Ethereum Users Get Reprieve From Soaring Fees      Ether options traders are heavily betting on the asset’s price at the end of the year. Over 473,500 ETH in open interest is set for expiration on Dec. 25, which is approximately $166,023,00 worth of options at Thursday’s spot prices.      Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha 5, says traders started piling up ether options positions for December a while ago. “It really started gearing up with DeFi a few months back,” he said. There’s two main reasons for the options bets, Shah added. “It’s either a levered play on DeFi doing well, or as a tail hedge against impermanent losses,” he said. Impermanent loss is when an investor contributes to a liquidity pool and can temporarily be worse off than actually just holding the asset due to protocol imbalances.

42405103,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLQx5,1602185432,New Ethereum Fee Model Has Some Miners Crying Foul: Survey,"Ethereum miners are signaling their disapproval of a technical proposal advocated by top Ethereum developers, a new survey shows.      Eight of the nine mining projects partaking in a community survey on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 had a negative impression of the proposal, with seven of the nine saying they would refuse to implement the EIP if it were included in a future hard fork.      EIP 1559 swaps Ethereum’s current bid-based transaction market for a set fee, BASEFEE, with a small tip for miner compensation. The EIP gained steam over the summer months as the cost to send even a basic transaction broke $10 multiple times.      Read more: Ethereum Developers Consider New Fee Model as Gas Costs Climb      The survey included 25 Ethereum projects, with most choosing to remain anonymous, Tim Beiko, ConsenSys product manager and survey implementor, said in the Medium post. The survey lacked participation from exchanges or wallets, according to Beiko.      Overall, positive and negative responses both garnered 42% of the vote, with the remainder being neutral or having no opinion.      First proposed in 2018 by Vitalik Buterin, among others, EIP 1559 is expected to make the blockchain’s fee market more predictable and relieve congestion.      What EIP 1559 does not do is promise lower transaction fees. Miners would still garner profits under the new model, but they would be restricted compared to the current setup as the BASEFEE would be burnt to the network. Doing so would add a deflationary mechanism to the Ethereum network’s native currency, ether (ETH).    Unhappy Ethereum miners    Yet, Ethereum miners have the most to lose from the proposal becoming the new standard because transaction fees would be limited to a smaller range. It’s never been more lucrative to be a miner, with profitability hitting all-time highs throughout 2020, according to BitInfoCharts.      “It has been a very misleading EIP, and a majority of the supporters are some Twitter thought-leaders (sic) who believe it will moon the price. lol,” BitFly technical writer Butta said in a private message to CoinDesk. BitFly’s Ethermine is the second-largest Ethereum mining pool by hashrate, according to Etherscan.      Conversely, the largest Ethereum mining pool, Sparkpool, is in favor of the change, according to statements made to CoinDesk in June. Sparkpool did not return a request for comment by press time.    Post-Berlin hard fork    As of now, Ethereum developers are still kicking the tires on the EIP. They will not include it until after the Berlin hard fork, which has yet to be scheduled for execution after it was postponed in June.      Read more: Ethereum Developers Delay Berlin Hard Fork to Stem Client Centralization Concerns      Moreover, the survey and EIP 1559 developer call Thursday morning raised separate concerns over the EIP itself. While miners are worried about their pocketbooks, decentralized applications (dapps) worry about implementing the EIP, its effectiveness and changes to developer tooling.      Some Ethereum clients such as Nethermind and Besu have begun implementing the EIP on testnets. But other clients, including Geth and OpenEthereum, are waiting for a finalized specification before releasing the EIP on testnet.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/08/new-ethereum-fee-model-has-some-miners-crying-foul-survey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b1bef656aef11ab73515661bde6b58bfde71654-2560x1828.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405100,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLQsA,1602185164,Pantera Capital’s First Venture Fund Did Pretty Well. Its Second Fund? Not So Much,"Pantera Capital, a cryptocurrency investment firm known for its blockbuster bitcoin returns, has been on the upside when investing in startups, though the returns have been falling below or closer to other types of equity investors.      The venture funds Pantera Capital raised in August 2013 and August 2014 have returned 46.5% and 15.9% from their inception to September 2019, respectively, according to firm data obtained by CoinDesk. The returns underperform index funds most retail investors can buy into and outperform venture funds limited to smaller pools of accredited investors.      Up to September 2019, the S&P 500 index, for example, has returned, adjusted for inflation, 62.6% over the first Pantera venture fund and 40.8% over the second Pantera venture fund. United States funds included in the 2019 Cambridge Associates Venture Capital Index have returned on average 12.08% on a five-year timescale and 14.55% on a 10-year time scale.    Why the drop?    Paul Veradittakit, a venture partner at Pantera Capital, attributed the dramatic gap in performance to the different focus and size of the funds. The closely aged funds’ returns slid as the second fund ramped up investments in 36 companies and counting, in diverse companies building mostly supplemental cryptocurrency products — a more than fourfold rise from the first fund’s eight companies dedicated to cryptocurrency services catering to the bare essentials.      While the first Pantera venture fund has invested in digital asset developers like Ripple Labs and basic exchanges and payment processors like Bitstamp, Xapo, Circle and Ripio (formerly known as BitPagos), the second venture fund has invested in exchanges with peripheral financial instruments like cryptocurrency futures platform ErisX, scattered cryptocurrency platforms that include Shapeshift, Abra, Brave, Civic, Starkware, BitOasis and BitPesa, and even another cryptocurrency fund manager, Polychain Capital.      Read more: Pantera Crypto Hedge Funds Are Losing Double Digits, Bitcoin Fund Is Up 10,000% to Date      Information was not provided on Pantera Capital’s third venture fund, which has raised $164.7 million as of August, just slightly under a $175 million ceiling sought since 2018. But if strategy and volume is any indication, the third Pantera venture fund has mirrored the approach of the second fund, putting more money into ErisX, Starkware and at least 16 in-the-weeds companies. Among these newer startups are The Block, a cryptocurrency research site; and Bakkt, a New York Stock Exchange corporation-connected bitcoin futures exchange.      In all, Pantera Capital’s assets were valued at over $448 million in financial filings this year, covering $249.3 million in the venture funds. The venture funds take at least $50,000 and $100,000 sums from investors and spend about $1 million to $3 million on 10% to 20% equity stakes in seed-stage investments. For Series A venture investments, Pantera Capital commits somewhere from $3 million to $8 million to 3% to 15% stakes in companies.    Hits and misses    Exits – mergers, acquisitions and listings on public stock exchanges – are how venture capital funds realize returns, positive or negative, on their investments, depending on company financials and investment timing. The seven-year-old cryptocurrency investment firm has had 14 exits make $66 million on $16 million of capital invested in its venture companies, according to the firm data dated to this month a year ago.      While not counted in realized returns, companies that do not exit still contribute to a venture fund’s value. All companies considered by last September, Pantera Capital grew the value of capital in the first venture fund from $12 million to $92 million, in the second venture fund from $26 million to $41 million.      Read more: Pantera Crypto Funds Report 100% Returns Amid DeFi Craze      In the first fund, the venture data says Pantera Capital in 2018 took away $50.5 million from a $9.2 million investment and 6% stake in Bitstamp when 80% of the bitcoin exchange sold to Belgian investment holding company NXMH. Pantera Capital also stands to make $22.3 million from the remaining 20% Bitstamp equity should it be bought, making it one of the fund’s more lucrative investments.      Less remarkable than the Bitstamp exit, the second Pantera venture fund drew in one of its notable exits in Korbit – $6 million from a $603,205 investment – when the Korean digital currency exchange was acquired in 2017 by Korean gaming developer NXC Corp.      Unlike the second fund, the first Pantera venture fund has not had a company end in a bankruptcy or a closure that did not involve a buy-out. At least two cryptocurrency apps backed by the second fund have shut down, bringing its value down along with them: Basis, a $133 million-funded coin that planned to back itself with fiat currency, and TruStory, a crowd-sourced crypto-offering fact-checking site that raised $3.3 million.    Exits with unknown returns    Five other acquisitions have also contributed to Pantera’s venture returns, but the data does not specify how much money they made, if any. Acquired in the first fund was promotional site Earn.com. In the second fund, there were security token issuer Harbor, trading platform Paradex and virtual currency portfolio tracker Blockfolio. The third fund invested in Blockfolio again and the digital currency brokerage Tagomi.      What is known is that two of the acquisitions, Harbor and Earn.com, sold for around or below the respective $38 million and $121 million they raised, suggesting some investors may have lost money or written them off. Many investors backed Earn.com when it was a bitcoin mining chip producer, 21 Inc., a business model and name that was subsequently scrapped and rebranded. Virtual currency exchange Coinbase in 2018 acquired Earn.com for about $100 million and Harbor sold for around $38 million to cryptocurrency custodian BitGo in 2019.

Coinbase bought Paradex in 2018 for more than its seed-only funding, and it added Tagomi for about $150 million in May.

42405105,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLQw6,1602180843,The DOJ's 'Crypto Enforcement Framework' Argues Against Privacy Tools and for International Regulation,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s Department of Justice (DOJ) believes cryptocurrencies pose an emerging challenge to law enforcement activities, according to a new publication filed Thursday.      The DOJ’s “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework” document, published by the Attorney General’s Cyber-Digital Task Force, outlines what cryptocurrencies are and their potential use cases, including sections on both legitimate and illicit uses (though the “legitimate uses” section was shorter and more skeptical). Crypto has been used to support terrorism, purchase illicit items, conduct blackmail and extortion, cryptojacking and launder funds, according to the document, and the DOJ has spent the last two years determining how best to address these issues.      “Those efforts are paying off,” wrote Sujit Raman, the task force’s chair, referencing recent cases against would-be token issuer Telegram; child-exploitation ring Welcome to Video; sanctions designations and other efforts. And while the report was published by the DOJ, it encompasses efforts by all parts of the federal government, including civil regulatory agencies.      In a statement, Attorney General William Barr said, “Cryptocurrency is a technology that could fundamentally transform how human beings interact, and how we organize society. Ensuring that use of this technology is safe, and does not imperil our public safety or our national security, is vitally important to America and its allies.”      The report itself is split into three sections: an overview of the cryptocurrency space and its current illicit uses; the laws and regulatory agencies that oversee the space; and the current challenges and potential strategies to address them.      The report warns that cryptocurrencies are more difficult for investigators to learn about than previous tools for executing crimes, citing pump-and-dump schemes as one example.    Cryptocurrency is a technology that could fundamentally transform how human beings interact, and how we organize society. Ensuring that use of this technology is safe, and does not imperil our public safety or our national security, is vitally important to America and its allies.    Investigators must learn to use “specialized communications applications,” the report said. Further, the markets being used evolve rapidly, with the report pointing to how the initial coin offering boom has given way to decentralized finance markets. The fact that blockchains are borderless, allowing anyone from any part of the world to interact with the markets, “adds a further layer of complexity.”      “Finally, decentralized platforms, peer-to-peer exchangers, and anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that use non-public or private blockchains all can further obscure financial transactions from legitimate scrutiny,” the report said.    In short    Much of the first section of the report simply provides an overview of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and distributed ledgers more broadly and how they’ve been used over the past few years.      The report distinguishes between virtual currencies, which are a “digital representation of value,” and cryptocurrencies, which it describes as being in a subset of virtual currencies that are decentralized and based on blockchains.      It goes on to explain addresses, wallets, miners and other aspects, noting that while some transactions are private and easy to query on the blockchain, some cryptocurrencies emphasize privacy (the DOJ does not appear to be a fan of these currencies).      “As discussed in Part I, a wide range of criminal activity may involve or be facilitated by the use of cryptocurrency. On numerous occasions, the Department of Justice has used available legal tools to pursue successful prosecutions of such activity,” the report said in the opening to its second section.      Read more: The DOJ Wants to Hire a Crypto Crime Attorney Adviser      It summarizes the U.S. government’s actions over the past few years. In addition to criminal cases brought by the DOJ, civil cases brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) were highlighted, such as the SEC’s case against Telegram, which raised $1.7 billion in an initial coin offering but ultimately had to refund investors.      Agencies with oversight or enforcement power in the space include the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the SEC, the CFTC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization that provides standards and recommendations for international money laundering rules, also received a mention.    Enforcement    It is the third section, “Ongoing Challenges and Future Strategies,” however, the DOJ noted that some exchanges and entities play “jurisdictional arbitrage,” looking for the friendliest jurisdiction in which to operate. This can harm law enforcement agencies’ efforts to “investigate, prosecute and prevent criminal activity” that involves virtual assets, the report claimed.      “In the United States, AML/CFT standards have been in place for [money services businesses, or MSB] engaged in virtual asset activities since 2011, and yet many [virtual asset service providers, or VASP] still are operating in ways that do not comply with the [Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA] and other regulatory requirements,” the report said, referring to anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism standards.      This concern is exacerbated with companies that operate across different countries. A VASP might apply a different standard within the U.S. than it does outside it, or use different standards for crypto-to-fiat transactions compared to crypto-to-crypto transactions, the report claimed.      “Such behaviors are flatly inconsistent with VASPs’ BSA obligations and can create significant financial intelligence gaps,” it said.      Read more: US Antitrust Chief Says Protecting Blockchain From Competitive Abuses Is Top Priority      The DOJ report also took particular aim at privacy coins, mixers, tumblers and other tools that are intended to conceal aspects of transactions.      Any website that offers mixing or tumbling services is “engaged in money transmission,” meaning it is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act. Websites that don’t follow the BSA or similar international regulations might face criminal prosecution, the report said.      As part of this section, the DOJ maintained its right and ability to prosecute violations conducted by entities based outside the U.S. should those entities still involve U.S. persons or services.      “The Department also has robust authority to prosecute VASPs and other entities and individuals that violate U.S. law even when they are not located inside the United States,” the report said. “Where virtual asset transactions touch financial, data storage, or other computer systems within the United States, the Department generally has jurisdiction to prosecute the actors who direct or conduct those transactions.”      While the DOJ most recently filed charges against BitMEX, it has in the past also gone after other non-U.S. based entities, such as 1broker.    ‘Response strategies’    The report similarly had an emphasis on national security concerns created by cryptocurrencies in its conclusion, saying rogue states and terrorists could take advantage of decentralized assets to undermine financial markets, avoid sanctions and fund harmful activities.      “As the use of cryptocurrency evolves and expands, so too will opportunities to commit crime and to do harm by exploiting cryptocurrency technology,” the report said. “Ultimately, illicit uses of cryptocurrency threaten not just public safety, but national security, as well … Current terrorist use of cryptocurrency may represent the first raindrops of an oncoming storm of expanded use that could challenge the ability of the United States and its allies to disrupt financial resources that would enable terrorist organizations to more successfully execute their deadly missions or to expand their influence.”    Current terrorist use of cryptocurrency may represent the first raindrops of an oncoming storm of expanded use that could challenge the ability of the United States and its allies to disrupt financial resources that would enable terrorist organizations to more successfully execute their deadly missions or to expand their influence.    A large part of the DOJ's future efforts will depend on education around the cryptocurrency space, bringing regulators and government officials fully up to speed as the space evolves.      The report stressed that private stakeholders in the industry must work with regulators and elected officials.      Federal authorities must also work with state officials, the report said, to ensure ""de-confliction"" while conducting investigations.

In a companywide memo obtained by CoinDesk, Armstrong informed employees that 5% of the company’s workforce had accepted the severance package offered last week. The deadline for employees to signal their interest in the package was Wednesday, and Armstrong said he expects the number to be higher after a “handful of other conversations” are completed.      “I know there have been many difficult conversations happening to help clarify what our apolitical culture means in practice,” Armstrong wrote. “It’s been great to see the whole team come together to reach understanding here, and support each other through it. It’s not easy to get through, but I think it will result in us having a stronger and more united team.”      Armstrong said the company could have done a “better job” helping Coinbase’s operating group and managers understand the new mission. He also said the exit package had been taken primarily by people who were not part of Coinbase’s “under-represented minority population” and that Coinbase would “continue to keep a close eye on this to ensure we are building a diverse, inclusive environment where everyone feels they belong.”    Coinbase employees speak    One employee at the firm, who spoke with CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity, said the severance package was taken mostly by engineers – as opposed to less-mobile employees like customer support. Another source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the departures were pretty evenly distributed.    I’m worried that the severance package was too good.    Another employee was surprised to hear the number of people who had left. “I’m worried that the severance package was too good,” he said.      Read more: Coinbase Offers Severance Package to Employees Unsatisfied With ‘Apolitical’ Mission      In his Thursday memo, Armstrong also clarified that the new mission would not mean employees don’t have to “pretend politics don’t exist.”      “We support each other through tough times and also have conversations about recent events like any team,” Armstrong wrote in the memo. “We have just made a decision to not engage in broader activism as a company outside of our mission.”      While it’s clear that employees are not allowed to talk politics in general Slack channels and have to set up separate non-general channels to talk politics, it’s not clear what counts as political and what counts as apolitical. As CoinDesk reported Friday, employees were told a #spaghetti-monster-for-president Slack channel would be in keeping with the new policy.

Armstrong also said the cultural norms at Coinbase will be re-articulated and clarified in the future as the company scales.      “I’m excited to be moving forward as #OneCoinbase to pursue our vision of economic freedom for every person and business,” he concluded.

42405116,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLQoE,1602175360,Reading Between the Lines of Brian Armstrong's Mission Memo,"Last week, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, published a Medium post stating the company would not engage in broad societal issues, would not take on activism and would not be a forum for political debate and discourse. He said he published this memorandum in response to internal strife at the company. If Wired is to be believed or the original text of the memo is any indication, much of that strife has been related to Coinbase’s response, or lack of it, to the Black Lives Matter movement.      Reading between the many lines of PR-appropriate language, the message Armstrong is sending is: If you want to push a progressive social agenda in the workplace, this is not the company for you. As the investor and writer Paul Graham said of the memo: “It is diplomatically phrased, but the underlying message, for those who grasp it, is anything but.”    Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.    So why such tortured – or rather diplomatic – phrasing? Why go to the length of openly publishing this company document and even framing it as an example for other CEOs, only to couch the message in code? And what makes this supposedly neutral stance “anything but” diplomatic?      I believe the indirectness of Armstrong’s memo speaks to the very issue that he is working to change within his company. Cancel culture and the performative wokeness pervasive to Silicon Valley have left little room for discussion around questions like where, when and how social justice issues should be addressed. Fear of being cancelled has left many who don’t subscribe to the most liberal perspectives feeling forced to speak in dog whistles. Armstrong’s post is one such example.      Hear Jill Carlson discuss this column with Emily Parker and Ben Schiller on the Opinionated podcast:      What is performative wokeness? To be ""woke"" is to be cognizant of issues related to social justice. Performative wokeness is the act of signaling to the world how woke you are, regardless of your actual engagement in the issues.      Some instances of this, I would argue, are at worst harmless and at best effective in raising awareness. A company changing its logo to a rainbow during Pride Month does not strike me as harmful, even if the move may ring hollow. A CEO stating publicly that “Black Lives Matter” may not be damaging but may turn out to be rather hypocritical depending on the company’s priorities and culture. Performative wokeness does more for performers than for the causes they are purporting to support, garnering them kudos from the community while doing relatively little for the community for which they claim to advocate.      See also: Emily Parker - Coinbase’s ‘Mission’ Violates the Spirit of Bitcoin      Indeed, many instances of performative wokeness actually backfire, harming the very causes for which the performer is advocating. This is where we get into censorship and cancel culture. Shaming others for their political views or demanding the dismissal of a colleague because of whom they voted for might be on some level understandable given the emotional and divisive nature of many of the most salient issues today. But silencing and shaming are not pragmatic because they are more likely to further radicalize the other side and drive any chance at discourse underground.      With this context, one view of Armstrong’s post is that he is denouncing performative wokeness in the workplace in defence of tolerance, diversity of thought and free speech. That, however, is not the message I actually gleaned from his letter. His words do not champion open-mindedness, civil engagement and respect for dissenting views and differing experiences. Rather, he instructs employees to leave political and social issues at the door and calls for the suppression of open discussion, all in the interest of focusing on the job at hand. He meets intolerance and silencing with further intolerance and silencing.      A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a piece predicting a future that looks remarkably like the present. In the world I describe, speech is not free, cancel culture is alive and well, and open discourse only takes place in private chats amongst the trusted and like-minded. Those who fall out of line are at risk of being fired from their jobs for their views. I could not have predicted that a week later Coinbase would be all but asking employees to leave for being vocal about their social stances and political views.    Fear of being cancelled has left many who don’t subscribe to the most liberal perspectives feeling forced to speak in dog whistles.    There are many aspects of Armstrong’s memo I find disconcerting. He talks about the workplace being a refuge from division and creating an environment in which employees can focus. He does not acknowledge that, for many, an environment in which they cannot discuss important issues or air their experiences is far from a refuge. He talks about bringing economic freedom to the world while seeming to avoid the inequalities in economic freedom in his own city, state, country. There are many dynamics he glosses over.      But what troubles me the most is that, instead of creating space for productive pushback, for the discussion of nuance and for diversity of opinion, he closes it off. This is worth noting and caring about because this pattern is playing out on a larger scale across Silicon Valley and across the country. The backlash against cancel culture is not manifesting as advocacy for dialogue, free speech, nuance and tolerance. Rather, the backlash is only driving discourse deeper underground, breeding an even more intense culture of fear and further entrenching intolerance.      Over the long term, this type of backlash will only result in greater division. And the wound to heal will be even deeper the next time the fire around these issues ignites, whether that happens across the country or within a single company.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | RESEARCH,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/08/reading-between-the-lines-of-brian-armstrongs-mission-memo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0aefcafac1fda4513bc9bc904d6cf40876f67a91-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Barr announced Thursday the release of “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework,” a roadmap for policing the cryptocurrency landscape.    The framework provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency, Barr said.  An 83-page document accompanying the release included three sections – threat overview, law and future strategies – to guide DOJ's handling of the space.  The document's release comes two years after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a ""Cyber-Digital Task Force"" to study the ramifications of technological advances.  “Despite its relatively brief existence, this technology already plays a role in many of the most significant criminal and national security threats our nation faces,"" said Associate Deputy Attorney General Sujit Raman, chair of the Cyber-Digital Task Force, which wrote the report.  There are a number of instances where the DOJ will exert its authority over foreign actors, the report said, namely when ""virtual asset transactions touch financial, data storage or other computer systems"" with the U.S., if they use crypto to import illegal goods into the country and if they provide illegal services"" to defraud or steal from U.S. residents.  The report at times sounds an almost apocalyptic note: ""Current terrorist use of cryptocurrency may represent the first raindrops of an oncoming storm of expanded use that could challenge the ability of the United States and its allies to disrupt financial resources that would enable terrorist organizations to more successfully execute their deadly missions or to expand their influence.”    Read More: The DOJ's 'Crypto Enforcement Framework' Argues Against Privacy Tools and for International Regulation",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Kevin Reynolds, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/10/08/doj-warns-of-possible-oncoming-storm-in-report-detailing-dangers-of-terrorist-use-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/844d9b5c173f567b24cc7ae7790569dc5e958097-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42384877,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlkvv,1602174858,"Blockchain Bites: Square's $50M BTC Investment, MetaMask's 1M Users, BitMEX's New CEO","CoinDesk is preparing for the invest: ethereum economy virtual event on Oct. 14 with a special series of newsletters focused on Ethereum's past, present and future. Every day until the event the team behind Blockchain Bites will dive into an aspect of Ethereum that excites or confuses us.    Increased usage    One of the best metrics of increased usage in the Ethereum economy comes via wallet adoption, the entry point for anyone wanting to interact with decentralized finance, or DeFi.      Wallets are a key part of the discussion around DeFi adoption and a focus of the CoinDesk invest: ethereum economy panel “Unlocked: TVL and Beyond - Measuring the DeFi Economy” on Oct. 14. Total value locked, or TVL, may measure the top-line numbers, but wallets are where investors park their crypto.      The MetaMask wallet, a browser extension that allows users to interact with the Ethereum network and its multitude of smart contract-based DeFi applications, has surpassed 1 million users. That's a fourfold increase for the wallet since 2019, which is developed and maintained by New York-based software firm ConsenSys.      Chasing juicy returns in the DeFi space, which can sometimes provide double- or triple-digit returns for lending crypto, is one of the reasons for MetaMask’s growth, said John Willock, CEO of Tritium Digital Assets, a crypto liquidity provider. “I think we can all recognize that a lot of the adoption of MetaMask is through the recent DeFi craze and interest in short-term returns that has been perceived to be out there to chase,” he said.      However, that speculation is bringing real adoption, Willock added, as he compared MetaMask to a web browser, which is the piece of software that has on-boarded almost everyone to the internet.      “I look at the MetaMask numbers as the same sort of early adoption indicator the uptake of Netscape browser use was in the 1990s. It is exciting,” he said.      What’s even more interesting: Developing countries lead in MetaMask adoption. India, Nigeria and the Philippines are the countries with most MetaMask usage after the United States.      “Metamask passing 1 million users is an impressive feat. It's by far the most used browser wallet and gives the community a best-in-class balance between security, functionality and usability,” said Brian Mosoff, chief executive of investment firm Ether Capital.      “I expect MetaMask will continue to dominate as DeFi and other Ethereum applications flourish over the coming months and years,” Mosoff added.      It’s simple: More wallet users means more adoption of the Ethereum economy. Although MetaMask requires some knowledge of mnemonic seed storage by users, it’s actually a pretty delightful wallet for an increasingly growing DeFi ecosystem.      – Daniel Cawrey    Featured panel    Stablecoins, Hyper-Collateralization and the DeFi Economy The rise of fiat- and algorithm-backed stablecoins has largely put crypto's volatility narrative to rest.

In a run-up to the event, our two-part CoinDesk Live: Inside the Ethereum Economy virtual miniseries on Oct. 8 and Oct. 12 introduces trending narratives we will break down at the main event: Why all the hype behind yield farming and food-inspired tokens? Should investors take them seriously or are they a fading trend?      On Oct. 8, CoinDesk senior business reporter Brady Dale hosts Priyanka Desai of Open Law, Mason Nystrom of Messari and Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX to assess the newest crazes sweeping the DeFi landscape.      Watch DeGeneration: How Ethereum Is Making Finance Weird on Oct. 8.    Ethereum 101    Just as MetaMask has become an important on-ramp to the Ethereum economy, so, too, are the narratives that capture people’s attention.      This past year has seen the rise of new memetic trading strategies – ways to both interact with and discuss Ethereum applications – that have set the pace for development.      Yield farming, “the rocket fuel of DeFi,” is one such strategy. A silly name, but an important concept. CoinDesk’s Brady Dale explained in July how it all works.      Minding fields The hot new term in crypto is “yield farming,” a shorthand for clever strategies where putting crypto temporarily at the disposal of some startup’s application earns its owner more cryptocurrency.      Another term floating about is “liquidity mining.” The buzz around these concepts has evolved into a low rumble as more and more people get interested.      The casual crypto observer who only pops into the market when activity heats up might be starting to get faint vibes that something is happening right now. Take our word for it: Yield farming is the source of those vibes.      Broadly, yield farming is any effort to put crypto assets to work and generate the most returns possible on those assets.      At the simplest level, a yield farmer might move assets around within Ethereum-based credit market Compound, constantly chasing whichever pool is offering the best APY from week to week. This might mean moving into riskier pools from time to time, but a yield farmer can handle risk.      “Farming opens up new price arbs [arbitrage] that can spill over to other protocols whose tokens are in the pool,” said Maya Zehavi, a blockchain consultant.      Because these positions are tokenized, though, they can go further.      In a simple example, a yield farmer might put 100,000 USDT into Compound. They will get a token back for that stake, called cUSDT. Let’s say they get 100,000 cUSDT back (the formula on Compound is crazy so it’s not 1:1 like that but it doesn’t matter for our purposes here).      They can then take that cUSDT and put it into a liquidity pool that takes cUSDT on Balancer, an AMM that allows users to set up self-rebalancing crypto index funds. In normal times, this could earn a small amount more in transaction fees. This is the basic idea of yield farming. The user looks for edge cases in the system to eke out as much yield as they can across as many products as it will work on.      Right now, however, things are not normal, and they probably won’t be for a while because liquidity mining supercharges yield farming.      Liquidity mining is when a yield farmer gets a new token as well as the usual return (that’s the “mining” part) in exchange for the farmer’s liquidity.      “The idea is that stimulating usage of the platform increases the value of the token, thereby creating a positive usage loop to attract users,” said Richard Ma of smart-contract auditor Quantstamp.      The yield farming examples above are only farming yield off the normal operations of different platforms. Supply liquidity to Compound or Uniswap and get a little cut of the business that runs over the protocols – very vanilla.      But Compound announced earlier this year it wanted to truly decentralize the product and it wanted to give a good amount of ownership to the people who made it popular by using it. That ownership would take the form of the COMP token.      By giving away a healthy proportion to users, that was very likely to make it a much more popular place for lending. In turn, that would make everyone’s stake worth much more.      So, Compound announced this four-year period where the protocol would give out COMP tokens to users, a fixed amount every day until it was gone. These COMP tokens control the protocol, just as shareholders ultimately control publicly traded companies.      Every day, the Compound protocol looks at everyone who had lent money to the application and who had borrowed from it and gives them COMP proportional to their share of the day’s total business.      COMP turned out to be a bit of a surprise to the DeFi world, in technical ways and others. It has inspired a wave of new thinking.      “Other projects are working on similar things,” said Nexus Mutual founder Hugh Karp. In fact, informed sources tell CoinDesk brand-new projects will launch with these models.      We might soon see more prosaic yield farming applications. For example, forms of profit-sharing that reward certain kinds of behavior.      As this sector gets more robust, its architects will come up with ever more robust ways to optimize liquidity incentives in increasingly refined ways. We could see token holders greenlighting more ways for investors to profit from DeFi niches.      – Brady Dale    The ledger    This year, decentralized finance emerged as Ethereum’s best bet at finding mainstream attraction. While still a fraction of the activity on Ethereum, and an even smaller portion of crypto generally, DeFi has captured the public’s attention.      The Financial Times, for instance, wrote a user’s guide to DeFi. But a few questions were left unanswered. CoinDesk contributor Alyssa Hertig responds to a few frequently asked questions, trying to filter the signal from the noise.      How do I make money with DeFi? The value locked up in Ethereum DeFi projects has been exploding, with many users reportedly making a lot of money.      Using Ethereum-based lending apps, as mentioned above, users can generate “passive income” by loaning out their money and generating interest from the loans. Yield farming, described above, has the potential for even larger returns, but with larger risk. It allows for users to leverage the lending aspect of DeFi to put their crypto assets to work generating the best possible returns. However, these systems tend to be complex and often lack transparency.      Is investing in DeFi safe? No, it’s risky. Many believe DeFi is the future of finance and that investing in the disruptive technology early could lead to massive gains.      But it’s difficult for newcomers to separate the good projects from the bad. And, there has been plenty of bad.      As DeFi has increased in activity and popularity through 2020, many DeFi applications, such as meme coin YAM, have crashed and burned, sending the market capitalization from $60 million to $0 in 35 minutes. Other DeFi projects, including Hotdog and Pizza, faced the same fate, and many investors lost a lot of money.      In addition, DeFi bugs are unfortunately still very common. Smart contracts are powerful, but they can’t be changed once the rules are baked into the protocol, which often makes bugs permanent and thus increasing risk.      When will DeFi go mainstream? While more and more people are being drawn to these DeFi applications, it’s hard to say where they’ll go. Much of that depends on who finds them useful and why. Many believe various DeFi projects have the potential to become the next Robinhood, drawing in hordes of new users by making financial applications more inclusive and open to those who don’t traditionally have access to such platforms.      This financial technology is new, experimental and isn’t without problems, especially with regard to security or scalability.      Developers hope to eventually rectify these problems. Ethereum 2.0 could tackle scalability concerns through a concept known as sharding, a way of splitting the underlying database into smaller pieces that are more manageable for individual users to run.      How will Ethereum 2.0 impact DeFi? Ethereum 2.0 isn’t a panacea for all of DeFi’s issues, but it’s a start. Other protocols such as Raiden and TrueBit are also in the works to further tackle Ethereum’s scalability issues.      If and when these solutions fall into place, Ethereum’s DeFi experiments will have an even better chance of becoming real products, potentially even going mainstream.      – Alyssa Hertig    At stake    Despite the buzz surrounding DeFi, the risks are clear. Donna Redel, adjunct professor of law at Fordham Law School, and Olta Andoni, of counsel at Zlatkin Wong, are two lawyers who have soured on the field (so to say): Regulators are circling, they said in an op-ed published in August.      DeFi’s demise? A corner of the crypto universe representing less than 1% of total market capitalization of crypto assets has been grabbing the headlines since June. This is the world of decentralized finance, or DeFi, which alternatively is referred to as the center of innovation, an experiment or the new wild, wild west where projects move fast and break things.      A recent glance of articles on CoinDesk demonstrates the phenomenon. Once again, crypto headlines are focusing on the “craze,” the “frenzy of yield farming,” “investors pouring money into” and “another protocol going up in a fireball.”      Will the nonstop headlines and framing around the “hot” new DeFi protocols chill the institutional adoption that is beginning in earnest for crypto, digital assets and blockchain technology?      We believe that, at a minimum, the industry needs self-regulation. Without it, it is on a trajectory to serious regulatory scrutiny and reputational risk.      As with almost everything in crypto, the strong sentiments and opinions make it difficult to determine the true essence and reality around the majority of DeFi projects. For us, this refrain is reminiscent of 2017’s frothy initial coin offering (ICO) days that ended badly for the good names of blockchain and crypto.      There are certainly similarities: trading frenzy; projects emerging with little or no testing and without audit; no clear regulatory guidance and the recycling of ETH now leading to inflated gas prices. Are we on the precipice of one of the regulatory agencies waking up and sending a missive similar to The Dao Report?      On the legal front, there is a lack of clear consensus about which agency should be regulating. And, again, there is a lack of guidance from multiple agencies that could be responsible for DeFi projects or for the space generally.      We are alarmed and concerned with the apparent lack of 360-degree understanding of the potential role of the various actors or operators and their possible interactions with the projects, the governance and hence DeFi ecosystem. Tokens are appearing overnight. Projects are hesitant to use, or totally avoid, terminology that might infer “issue,” “issuance” or “issuer,” as these are hypersensitive words in the securities world.      Calling a project an “experimental game” or an “innovation” is not sufficient to take it out of the regulatory ambit. The focus is shifting from securities regulation of “the issuer” and the Howey Test prevalent during the ICO days and after, to more complex analysis of the application of commodities regulation, questions relating to who is the “controlling stakeholder(s)” and whether liability or responsibility falls on them.      Many questions, from a perspective of both securities law and commodities laws, should be examined anew to see how they may be applied to, as well as reimagined for, a disintermediated-decentralized financial model.      The outstanding questions include whether the “controlling stakeholders” are determined by voting control on DeFi platforms, who among the investor group and founders who has voting control, and whether there should be standards for exchange listing.      Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether defining these projects as “decentralized” puts them outside of the regulatory reach or whether the “centralized” ones should be referred to as “disintermediated finance” – aka the ability to conduct secure financial transactions directly, without the use of financial intermediaries.      Despite the regulatory uncertainty, traders, projects and exchanges are going full steam ahead, with the result that tokens run high risks of unwarranted price changes, which impacts governance, liquidity and the well-being of the projects.      In our view, the DeFi experiment demonstrates the need for creating a new set of industry rules: audits, proper risk disclosures and planning to anticipate what could go wrong before it actually happens. DeFi self-regulation should normalize collateral sufficiency reviews, auditing standards, governance both on an ongoing and crisis basis as well as the distribution-centralized ownership of tokens.      It remains to be seen how a regulatory loophole in which these tokens are created, distributed and traded all without regulatory supervision will play out. At least with a modified Safe Harbor, proposed by Commissioner Hester Peirce, and which we commented on earlier this year, the SEC would have some oversight. For the moment, tokens in the DeFi are appearing daily and the explosion of tokens is leading to a distortion of purpose and “investors” are getting burned as projects implode.      – Donna Redel & Olta Andoni    Top shelf    Square <3s BTC Square, the payments company helmed by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, announced Thursday it has purchased 4,709 bitcoins, a $50 million investment representing 1% of the firm’s total assets. ""Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment and provides a way for the world to participate in a global monetary system, which aligns with the company’s purpose,"" the company said in a statement.

""For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.""      Options portend Activity in bitcoin options listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged Wednesday as investors traded call options. According to data source Skew, the CME traded $48 million worth of options during the day, the highest daily volume figure since Jul. 28. The number marks a 300% rise from Tuesday's figure of $12 million. ""The CME options had a strong session, and the spike in the volume was mainly due to increased activity in call options,"" Skew CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk over Telegram. The data suggests some traders foresee a bitcoin rally, but believe the upside will be capped near $16,000 until the end of December. Further, they expect prices to remain below $20,000 till the end of the first quarter of 2021.      Hayes steps down The founders of BitMEX are stepping down from their executive roles at the parent firm of the crypto derivatives exchange soon after U.S. authorities charged the firm over allegedly illegal conduct. In a blog post Thursday, 100x – the holding group for BitMEX operator HDR Holdings – announced that founders Arthur Hayes and Samuel Reed have “stepped back from all executive management responsibilities for their respective CEO and CTO roles with immediate effect.” Vivien Khoo, current chief operating officer of 100x Group, will become Interim CEO, while Ben Radclyffe, commercial director, will take on a supporting role with greater management of client relationships and oversight of financial products.      Enter Google Google Cloud is making moves to become an EOS validator, but not for the tokens. “Google Cloud is not getting into crypto mining. This is really an infrastructure play for us,” Google Cloud Developer Advocate Allen Day told CoinDesk’s Brady Dale. On Tuesday, Block.one, the company that runs the EOS blockchain, announced Google Cloud is mulling becoming one of the network’s 21 block producers. Day said the company is committed to supporting public blockchain infrastructure, as seen by previously forged relationships with Hedera Hashgraph and Theta Labs, a video content relayer.      FATF standards The Travel Rule Protocol (TRP), a working group favored by banks and traditional financial institutions and focused on bringing crypto in line with global anti-money laundering (AML) standards, has released the first version of its API. The 25-member TRP working group, which includes Standard Chartered, ING Bank and Fidelity Digital Assets, said the product aims to offer a straightforward way for firms to swap identification data. This includes data of originators and beneficiaries of crypto transactions, as per the requirements of global AML watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

42384870,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlkqt,1602173097,Ethereum Is the Frontier of Financial Innovation,"Innovation across various global industries seems to be moving at an accelerating pace. This makes sense because innovation in one sector ultimately makes innovation in other sectors cheaper. As innovation becomes cheaper, we can naturally expect it to increase in usage.      The advances we’ve seen in the world are all underpinned by silicon and computation. Whatever time-saving invention you’ve created is probably better with a chip in it, though finance is seemingly excluded from this hard and fast rule.    David Hoffman is the co-founder of Bankless, a content studio with a newsletter, podcast and YouTube channel focused on education on how to live a life without banks. He will lead a discussion, ""Trade Secrets: The 'Triple Point' Bull Case for ETH,"" at CoinDesk's invest: ethereum economy on Oct. 14.    Regulatory red tape and walled gardens between financial institutions are potential culprits. But it’s not obvious that removing these obstacles would enable the level of innovation seen in industries that have successfully integrated chips and software.      The reason why innovation in the finance industry seems to move at a snail's pace is the lack of a developer sandbox for experimentation. There are no startup studios where coders are able to attempt to turn an idea into a product and learn lessons along the way.      As research and development in finance moves into the developers' domain, the costs of innovation drops, leading to an innovation explosion. Once the keys to the kingdom are given over to those who code, thousands of global developers will compete to find the best way to supplement an industry.      This is what Ethereum offers to the world: A place for financial experimentation to mature into consumer products. DeFi, or decentralized finance, is both the place where financial products are tested (often in production), and also refined, finalized and shipped to the 4.5 billion users available on the internet.      While the rest of the finance industry is devoid of experimental oxygen, DeFi simultaneously offers both the tools needed to produce products and the consumers ready to consume them.      See also: Lex Sokolin – The Revolution You’ve Been Awaiting: Fintech + DeFi    Innovation occurs when the costs of iteration and experimentation reduce.    Ethereum’s permissionlessness creates an environment for anyone willing to learn Solidity to be able to access thousands of potential users and potentially billions of dollars in interested capital, so long as their product is worthy. It also increases the attractiveness of Ethereum as a financial platform for the end user, who may come to understand Ethereum as the frontier of financial innovation.      Innovation occurs when the costs of iteration and experimentation reduce. As a platform, Ethereum enables a low-cost developer sandbox to emerge. The nature of open-source software platforms means anyone can add knowledge and software to the common library of knowledge of mechanisms available to developers. Ethereans call this “money legos.” When someone builds something important, every other developer in the sandbox is able to access this construction and leverage it in their own product.      We saw this specifically with the YAM system, which integrated components from Ampleforth’s rebasing mechanism, Compound’s governance module, Yearn’s treasury and Synthetix’s staking contract as well as general purpose “liquidity mining.” As a result, YAM was a product that emerged from the repurposing of labor from other protocols in order to create a novel product. And broadly, the crucial primitive of the ERC-20 token standard was leveraged by every protocol mentioned.      YAM isn’t likely to solve any meaningful financial problem, but it is an illustration of experimentation for experimentation’s sake, which will always be available to future builders in the DeFi space.      There is no shortage of opportunity that DeFi offers to developers who want to tinker with financial toys that come with an opportunity to be refined into a consumer product.      See also: Michael Casey – Money Reimagined: COVID-19’s Lessons in Innovation      In an industry where development costs are not much greater than the time invested, I think we can expect a thousand experiments to bloom into dozens of world-changing products, with many runner-ups, honorable mentions and complete disasters.      One thing is certain: The experimentation will continue.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Hoffman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/08/ethereum-is-the-frontier-of-financial-innovation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00493dfb8a892fb50ce2a292c1ce4a23d739a40f-2400x1798.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384876,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlkuf,1602161678,"First Mover: Bitcoin 'Comatose' Under $16K for Rest of 2020, While Ether Traffic Eases","A slowdown in cryptocurrency trading on so-called decentralized exchanges has helped to alleviate congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, at least temporarily mitigating concerns the network was becoming overloaded.      The trading lull comes as prices tumble for many of the hottest tokens from the fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi. SushiSwap’s SUSHI token, one of this year’s splashiest debuts , fell by 77% in the past 30 days, while DeFi lender Compound’s COMP tokens lost 37%.      On Uniswap, the biggest decentralized exchange, or DEX, daily trading volumes have crashed to $224 million, versus a record high of $954 million on Sept. 1.      “Low volatility in the crypto market as a whole has contributed to lower transaction volume and costs,” said Connor Abendschein, a crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data.      DeFi, a subsector of the cryptocurrency industry where entrepreneurs are developing semi-automated trading and lending platforms atop blockchain networks, had surged in popularity in recent months among investors and traders alike. But the resulting congestion raised concerns elevated fees for sending transactions over the blockchain might stymie some users, or push application developers to consider alternative networks.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: As DeFi Deflates, Ethereum Users Get Reprieve From Soaring Fees, Congestion    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin remains comatose around $10,600 even though optimism has returned to equity markets.      S&P 500 futures are pointing to a positive open with a 0.53% gain. Stock markets in Asia and Europe eked out gains earlier today on renewed expectations for an additional U.S. fiscal stimulus.      The ""risk-on"" is weighing over the safe-haven U.S. dollar in the forex market. So far, however, that dollar weakness hasn't propelled bitcoin higher.      The top cryptocurrency is currently trading around $10,600, down 0.6% on the day.      And while the cryptocurrency remains stuck in a narrowing price range for the third week, activity in options listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has picked up the pace.      CME options trading volume surged by 300% to $48 million on Wednesday. The surge was fueled by increased activity in call options, according to Emmanuel Goh, CEO of crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Traders likely employed bull spreads by buying December expiry call options at $14,000 and simultaneously selling December expiry calls at $16,000. Similarly, calls expiring in March 2021 were bought at $18,000 and sold at $20,000.      These traders foresee a bitcoin price rally but believe the upside will be capped near $16,000 till the end of this year and $20,000 in the fist quarter of 2021.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Options Volume on CME Jumps 300% as Traders Take Bullish Bets    Token Watch    EOS (EOS): Alternative blockchain's ecosystem gets boost for trading liquidity as non-custodial digital-asset exchanger Eosfinex launches beta version, though Google Cloud does not intend to take EOS rewards as a block producer.

42384873,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlktP,1602158191,Bitcoin Options Volume on CME Jumps 300% as Traders Take Bullish Bets,"Activity in bitcoin options listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged Wednesday as investors traded call options, or bullish bets.    According to data source Skew, the CME traded $48 million worth of options during the day, the highest daily volume figure since July 28.  The number marks a 300% rise from Tuesday's figure of $12 million.  ""The CME options had a strong session, and the spike in the volume was mainly due to increased activity in call options,"" Skew's CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk over Telegram.  Options are derivative contracts used to hedge against sudden price swings or uncertainty in the spot market.  A call option gives the holder the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date; a put option represents a right to sell.  Volumes surged as some traders took $14,000 and $16,000 strike prices and $18,000 and $20,000 strike prices for the December 2020 and March 2021 expiry contracts, Skew noted early Thursday.  These can potentially be bullish structures [bull call spreads], Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk, adding that traders are unlikely to sell spreads in the current low volatility environment.  ""The likely case is that we're seeing some strategic gearing for the topside,"" Shah said.  To simplify, traders likely bought call options at $14,000 expiring in December and simultaneously sold December expiry calls at $16,000. Similarly, calls expiring in March 2021 were bought at $18,000 and sold at $20,000.  Traders employ bull call spreads when they expect the underlying asset to chart a limited rally in the near term.  The data suggests some traders foresee a bitcoin rally, but believe the upside will be capped near $16,000 until the end of December. Further, they expect prices to remain below $20,000 till the end of the first quarter of 2021.  Bitcoin is currently trading near $10,600, trapped in a narrowing price range for the third week.  A breakout would imply an end of the pullback from the August high of $12,476 and would expose resistance above $11,000.  Alternatively, a range breakdown may invite stronger chart driven selling, possibly yielding a re-test of September lows below $9,900.

42384863,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlki5,1602144000,"Group Backed by ING Bank, Fidelity and Standard Chartered Releases Crypto AML Tools","The Travel Rule Protocol (TRP), a working group favored by banks and traditional financial institutions and focused on bringing crypto in line with global anti-money laundering (AML) standards, has released the first version of its application programming interface (API).      Announced Thursday, the 25-member TRP working group, which includes Standard Chartered, ING Bank and Fidelity Digital Assets, has published the TRP API version 1.0.0.      The product aims to offer a straightforward way for firms to swap identification data about the originators and beneficiaries of crypto transactions, as per the requirements of global AML watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).      The headache of sharing personally identifiable information between virtual asset service providers (VASPs) has engendered a range of technical solutions from individual crypto firms and consortia dotted around the world. The TRP working group is the first to include large retail banks among its founding members, however.      “The impetus for the TRP API was a desire by the working group to ensure an easy path to Travel Rule compliance, as well as communications standardization and interoperability for VASPs around the world,” Maxime de Guillebon of SC Ventures, Standard Chartered’s innovation unit, said in a statement. “Our API allows organizations to do this as they mature, rather than attempting to integrate a number of already existing complex solutions during critical periods of time.”    How TRP works    The TRP release uses two simple RESTful APIs, designed for querying address ownership and sending required originator and beneficiary information about digital asset transfers.      The TRP API release builds on the widely-adopted InterVASP Messaging Standard (IVMS-101), said BC Group CEO Hugh Madden. (The TRP working group is chaired by Hong-Kong-based BC Group and its institutional crypto-focused subsidiary, OSL.)      Read more: In Banking First, ING Develops FATF-Friendly Protocol for Tracking Crypto Transfers      The IVMS-101 project, which is also a founding member of TRP, came up with a standard data format for the payload of Travel Rule messages. This innovation harmonized how information like date of birth, for example, is written in order to avoid data-field and formatting wrinkles.      “The TRP working group and API is about how you allow VASPs to share that [IVMS-101] data,” said Madden. “A RESTful API is the world standard for integrating business systems. It’s lightweight, well understood, and very interoperable. There’s no need to join any expensive industry associations or invest in vendor solutions, and it’s not an overly complicated technical implementation.”    Travel Rule implementation time    Travel Rule solutions coming to market comprise a range of approaches. Some solutions involve heroic attempts to preserve decentralization as much as possible while constructing global directories of VASPs, while others are focused on the tricky business of VASP discovery; in other words, flagging who is on the other end of a transaction and whether they can be trusted with customer data.      Madden said it makes sense to break things down into discovery type protocols and payload delivery systems. The work the TRP is doing, he said, is not so concerned with the discovery part, and rather concentrates on the process by which firms can compliantly deliver the information payload.      Read more: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      “The TRP focus doesn’t assume large-scale auto-discovery – although I know some groups are working on doing advanced auto-discovery, delivered transparently with nice user experience,” said Madden. “Not everyone is taking the same approach, but some TRP members are just intending to ask the user, before withdrawal goes out, which VASP are you sending it to. Then there’s no need for auto-discovery.”      This will obviously impact user experience, Madden said, “but once you know which VASP it is, and if the respective compliance teams are happy to share the data with the corresponding VASP, the TRP is about actually sharing that data in a secure way.”    Swelling ranks    It’s not surprising the TRP’s membership is growing, given the financial clout of its founding team. A spokesman for the working group said that while the names of new joiners could not be disclosed without their permission, it included four large exchanges and a host of large tech firms.      What can be revealed, however, is the new TRP API is being integrated by the consortium of financial institutions behind Pyctor, a digital-asset custody solution invited into this year’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) sandbox cohort.      Led by ING Bank, Pyctor includes ABN AMRO, BNP Paribas Securities Services, Citi, Invesco, Société Générale, State Street and UBS.      “We’re excited for the future as TRP is scalable in the financial sector while maximizing interoperability with other emerging Travel Rule solutions,” Hervé Francois, blockchain initiative lead at ING bank and Pyctor CEO, said in a statement. “We are implementing the TRP protocol in Pyctor and looking forward to driving the ecosystem adoption even further.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/08/group-backed-by-ing-bank-fidelity-and-standard-chartered-releases-crypto-aml-tools,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/294522a0d35b6d4b2e8aa45058e99d2849785886-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
