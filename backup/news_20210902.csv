The first and second cryptocurrencies by market cap seemed to be recovering well, after months of sustained selling pressure. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $49,319 with a 1.4% profit in the daily chart. Earlier, Bitcoin was rejected as it made its way back north of $50,000. BTC&apos;s price lost its first level of support at $49,800 and now sits at risk of returning to the mid-range of its current levels, around $46,000. This could be positive for Ethereum, as the second cryptocurrency by market cap keeps outperforming Bitcoin. A push too high from BTC&apos;s price could steal ETH shine. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,773 with a 1.9% and 16.8% profit in the daily and weekly charts, respectively. Investment firm QCP Capital made a market update, claiming that Ethereum &apos;started moving to their target&apos; on the ETH/BTC trading pair set at 0.0850, as seen below.

At an event organized by the Argentine Fintech Chamber on Tuesday, Pesce said that “the name cryptocurrency is not appropriate” because the blockchain-based units of account are precisely the opposite of what a currency should be, adding that crypto “refers to something hidden, opaque,” Argentinian newspaper Clarín reported.  Pesce also discussed an official document the BCRA published with Argentina’s Securities Commission (CNV), in which the central bank expressed that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender, have high volatility, are exposed to operational disruptions and cyberattacks, and have no safeguards, among other negative characteristics.  “We believe that we have to do [the] work of education, explaining to the population what these instruments are about to avoid generating situations in which, due to misinformation, someone makes an investment over which he has no control,” Pesce said.  Cryptocurrencies were created as a payment mechanism and not as an investment instrument, said Pesce, who added that their scarcity has made these instruments to become financial and raise their prices. That scenario, he commented, gives cryptocurrencies “a very high degree of volatility,” the very characteristic a currency should not have.  “For a currency, stability is something fundamental,” said Pesce, under whose central bank management the Argentinian peso dropped in value from $0.017 to $0.010, though it trades at $0.005 in the black market.  Because of a provision issued by the BCRA in 2019, Argentines are only permitted to buy up to $200 a month in dollars through official channels, with an additional tax of 65% over the official quote. Given this scenario, stablecoin purchases on cryptocurrency exchanges have increased sixfold during 2020.  In 2019, BCRA also forced service exporters to convert their income from dollars to Argentine pesos through an exchange channel authorized by the Argentine Central Bank. To avoid the switch to Argentine pesos, many exporters receive their payments in cryptocurrencies.  Pesce said on Tuesday that even if exporters get paid in cryptocurrencies, these have to be considered as dollarized payments that need to be converted into Argentine pesos.  “This is so, it is a rule of the Central Bank,” he said. “One can receive payment in the instrument or in the goods one wants: in the same way that one can receive a payment in species, one can receive a payment in cryptocurrencies.”  Pesce added that the BCRA is controlling the use of cryptocurrencies as a way to avoid exchange regulations. “The Central Bank is going to be careful that this type of instrument is not used to circumvent exchange regulations,” he said.  The BCRA is closely monitoring crypto movements in Argentina.

42396928,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT86k1,1630616105,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Enters September Slowdown; Cardano’s ADA at New High,"Bitcoin pulled back from the $50,000 resistance level on Thursday as overbought signals appeared on intraday charts. BTC was trading around $49,200 at press time and is up about 2% over the past 24 hours, compared to a 4% rise in Cardano’s ADA, which reached an all-time high of $3.09 before falling below $3.  Analysts expect limited upside for bitcoin as it enters a seasonally weak period. On average, bitcoin returns are typically negative in September. Returns in November, however, tend to be relatively high.  “Bitcoin is still above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating the positive trend is still in place, but the movement is slow,” Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at Bitpanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Instead, traders have shifted attention to alternative coins, which have outperformed bitcoin over the past month. However, some technical measures suggest the relative performance of these altcoins could weaken later this month.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $49,295, +2.2%  Ether (ETH), $3,782, +1.4%  S&P 500: +0.3%  Gold: $1,810, -0.2%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.287%  Historically weak September  “There is no love lost between bitcoin investors and the ninth month of the year,” FundStrat, a global investment advisory firm, wrote in a Thursday newsletter.  September appears to be the only month in which BTC has experienced a negative average return. “Based on the chart below, we can also see that the patterns in monthly returns roughly match the seasonality we experienced the past 12 months, with price increases in late-fall to early-winter followed by an all-time high in April,” FundStrat wrote.  Additionally, BTC drawdowns in September, or the percentage decline from peak to trough, has extended a four-year streak.  On a brighter note, bitcoin returns are typically strong after September, especially in November. “Even if bitcoin continues to mirror its historical seasonality, October through December could present an opportunity for outperformance,” FundStrat wrote.  Bitcoin dominance declines  Bitcoin’s market share relative to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization (dominance ratio) declined towards 40%. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has been losing ground to altcoins in terms of market share and returns over the past two months.  The chart below shows the BTC dominance ratio approaching levels last seen in May, which coincided with a top in the ETH/BTC ratio around the 0.08 resistance level. It appears that altcoin season could be due for a breather soon.  ETH used for NFT purchases  There is more ether leaving exchanges than bitcoin, possibly due to the resurgence of non-fungible token (NFT) activities.  “This shouldn’t come as a surprise at a time where the Ethereum ecosystem is creating a plethora of on-chain destinations for ETH outside the confines of centralized exchanges,” Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  Recently, traders have been using their ETH to buy NFTs and yield-generating decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens. “Meanwhile, bitcoin on exchanges remains mostly flat, as few incentives exist for deploying the assets outside centralized exchanges or cold storage,” Glassnode wrote.  The NFT frenzy has contributed to high network congestion and fees on the Ethereum blockchain, which can price out many retail investors. The table below shows NFT projects that consume the most network gas (computational effort).  Cardano tops $3  Cardano’s ADA token surged more than 7% Thursday to an all-time high over $3 as the project’s lead developer announced that smart-contracts functionality had been activated on a test network, bringing the blockchain a step closer to competition with Ethereum.  The ADA price rose as high as $3.09 before slipping to around $2.97 as of press time.  The latest rally came as lead developer IOHK, headed by Charles Hoskinson, tweeted that the Cardano test network had successfully deployed smart-contracts capability, and that the focus would now turn to the “Alonzo” upgrade of the main network, “still on track for deployment on Sept. 12.”  Cardano is currently the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap ($93.7 billion), behind rivals bitcoin ($934 billion) and Ethereum’s ether ($439 billion). The ADA token has soared 1,583% this year, versus 69% for bitcoin and 417% for ether.  Altcoin roundup:  FTX’s FTT token hits all-time high: The crypto exchange FTX led by Sam Bankman-Fried saw its native FTT token soar to fresh highs of nearly $70 on Thursday. The U.S.-based arm of the exchange announced earlier this week that it would be acquiring LedgerX, an options and futures trading platform regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  HaloDAO partners with DeFi protocol Balancer to build custom Automatic Market-Maker (AMM): HaloDAO, a stablecoin-focused DeFi project, has partnered with decentralized exchange (DEX) Balancer to facilitate swaps and yield generation for non-USD stablecoins. HaloDAO plans to create a custom automated market maker (AMM) to enhance stablecoin foreign exchange, creating markets like BTC/XSGD and ETH/THKD, among others. “The integration with Balancer v2 enables HaloDAO to complete several elements of its vision in one fell swoop,” said HaloDAO co-founder Jun Ming in a press release. “We want to create a full stack ecosystem for local stablecoins, and this means creating enough liquidity so that users could swap from local stablecoins into cryptocurrencies, or back.”  Relevant news:  Binance.US Could Go Public in 3 Years, CEO Zhao Says: Report  Stablecoins Are ‘Pretending’ to Be Currencies: ECB’s Lagarde  UXD Raises $3M to Bring Algorithmic Stablecoins to Solana  Central Bank Digital Currencies to Be Tested in BIS Experiment  Other markets:  Most digital assets in the CoinDesk 20 ended higher.

42396925,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT86j2,1630613435,Lido Dominates Booming Market for Ethereum 2.0 Staking Derivatives,"One of the hottest new ways to invest in ethereum is to lock money into a future, upgraded version of the Ethereum blockchain that’s already running in parallel, known as the Beacon Chain. The process is called “staking.” Investors put ether (ETH) into the Beacon Chain and can reap annualized yields in excess of 5%.  While that’s significantly higher than returns offered by most traditional bank accounts and U.S. Treasury bonds, the problem is that in some cases investors may not be able to “unstake” their tokens – get them back – for a year or more. For instance, the Beacon Chain won’t allow withdrawals until after Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work is complete.  To address the issue, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have created a new market known as “Ethereum 2.0 staking derivatives,” essentially special derivative tokens representing staked ETH. These tokens can be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications as collateral to earn additional yield. The whole point is to provide ether stakers with liquidity even while their tokens are tied up in the Beacon Chain, waiting for the upgrade that’s expected to go live next year. Have your cake and eat it too, as it were.  And one decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), in particular, Lido, has leaped to a dominant 80% market share in this fast-growing realm. Recently, the number of ether – the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain – staked via Lido crossed the 1 million milestone (worth $3.7 billion), marking a 45-fold year-to-date increase and accounting for 15% of all ETH staked on Ethereum’s Beacon Chain, according to Dune Analytics.  “With the progress being made toward Eth 2.0, there has been increased interest in staking ETH, and Lido is one of the best decentralized venues to do this through,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca Funds, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  “Eth 2.0” is shorthand for Ethereum 2.0, which refers to Ethereum’s ongoing transition from a proof-of-work blockchain (similar to Bitcoin’s) to proof-of-stake, which is supposed to be faster and far less energy-intensive. Ethereum staking began last December with the launch of the Beacon Chain, though the proof-of-work version still serves as the primary network until the upgrade takes effect.  Most staking pools, except SharedStake and Stakewise, have been growing, but Lido dominates the sector, according to Delphi Digital. Spartan Capital’s general partner and head of research, Jason Choi, said the protocol has received more than half of the recent new inflow.  Proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms secure blockchains by selecting transaction validators depending on the number of coins they hold. An entity needs to hold at least 32 ETH, worth about $120,960 at ether’s current price of $3,780, to become a validator on the Beacon Chain. (Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake mechanism is expected to happen early next year.)  Like Lido, centralized exchanges such as Kraken and Binance also pool user funds, allowing investors holding fewer than 32 ETH to contribute to Eth 2.0 and earn rewards. Those exchanges account for a significant portion of the coins held in the deposit contract of Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, according to a report from blockchain analytics firm Nansen emailed to CoinDesk on Aug. 17. The deposit contract currently holds more than 7 million coins, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  However, Kraken and Binance are losing share to decentralized staking protocols like Lido, according to Nansen.  Why Lido?  While centralized staking facilitates quick access and high liquidity, it comes with the risk of severe “slashing penalties” and reduced overall rewards. An Ethereum validator who engages in malicious behavior receives a slashing penalty and loses a significant amount of ether staked. Violators can also be forcibly removed from the network.  That risk is mitigated with Lido, which has several validators. “Nine active node operators [validators] are currently staking ETH on behalf of Lido, and five more have been on-boarded just recently,” the protocol’s tech lead, Vasiliy Shapovalov, told CoinDesk last week. So, even if one validator is identified as malicious, the resulting loss due to the slashing penalty is far less than what would be with a centralized exchange.  The protocol provides users liquidity on the underlying ether via a “staking derivative” token called stETH. When users deposit 1 ETH into the Lido protocol, they get 1 stETH in return.  “The rewards for stETH are accrued automatically. Each day your balance of stETH increases in your wallet,” Lido Finance said.  As Ben Giove, a contributor at crypto newsletter Bankless, noted, Lido users can earn staking yields, maintain their network share through the derivative token and use the same as collateral in other DeFi protocols.  Kraken offers a staking derivative. However, according to Lido DAO member Konstantin Lomashuk, it cannot be used outside of the exchange. Many of these centralized staking services require users to lock up their tokens. “Keep in mind that staked ETH cannot be unstaked,” Kraken warned in January on its website.  With Lido, technical risks associated with becoming a validator are transferred to industry experts. “Lido is non-custodial, but validation is handled by some of the best professional services, which gives even large funds confidence in entrusting their services,” Spartan Capital’s Choi said.  While Lido’s unique depositors and cumulative deposits have been trending up since the beginning of the year, the growth curve has been particularly steep in recent weeks.  Shapovalov, Lido’s tech lead, attributed the recent pickup in growth to several factors, including Lido’s staking referral program, its recent debut on the Terra blockchain-based Anchor protocol and a partnership with the decentralized finance protocol Curve Finance.  Referral program  Launched July 19, Lido’s referral program lets existing users earn lido token (LDO) rewards by encouraging other people to stake ether on the platform. LDOs are the Lido protocol’s governance tokens, offering potential value for holders through protocol fees.  According to the official website, the referring user receives 15 LDO tokens worth $87 for every ether staked due to a referral. So if a new user stakes 10 ETH (worth about $34,000 at current prices), the referring user receives a reward of 150 LDO or $870. The minimum stake to generate a reward is one ETH.  Users can claim referral rewards on the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange DiversiFi without having to pay gas fees.  The referral program has brought in about 300,000 ETH, Shapovalov told CoinDesk; that’s worth more than $1 billion at current ether prices. That accounts for most, but not all, of the 360,00 ETH increase on the platform since the referral program was launched, according to Dune Analytics.  “It’s important to also note the powerful Lindy effects at play,” Spartan Capital’s Choi said. The Lindy effect is the idea that the older something is, the longer it’s likely to be around in the future.  stETH’s DeFi foray  Some analysts said the recent move by Anchor protocol to adopt bETH – a version of the stETH tokens retrofitted to work on the Terra blockchain – as collateral has bolstered Lido’s growth.  “As it stands, Eth 2.0 staking is one-directional, i.e. you can deposit and stake your ETH, but you can’t withdraw it yet,” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said. In contrast, “bETH lets you lend and borrow your staked ETH on the Terra network, a dynamic which in turn has literally opened up flood gates.”  According to Messari research analyst Jack Anderson, bETH has opened up a cross-chain opportunity for stETH holders to earn a yield on their staked ETH.  “Before, they could take their stETH and deposit in the Curve pool to earn additional yield (on top of the ETH 2 staking rewards), and now they can use bETH to borrow Terra USD or UST by converting their stETH into bETH,” Anderson said. UST is the algorithmic stablecoin of the Terra blockchain. Anderson added that Lido’s efforts to decentralize and maintain transparency have given people a lot of confidence.  According to Bankless, the stETH-ETH pool on Curve Finance launched earlier this year is the most prominent stETH integration to date. The pool allows the stETH token holders to swap between the staking derivative and “regular” ETH. Anyone can provide liquidity to the stETH pool in return for staking rewards paid out in LDO and trading fees. At press time, the pool holds $4.8 billion in deposits and more than 700,000 stETH. That’s more than 50% of the derivative token’s total circulating supply.  Therefore, holders of stETH can simply stop staking by selling the derivative token for ether through Curve Finance. However, in that case the stETH seller loses staking rewards to the buyer.  While Lido and decentralized staking, in general, holds an edge over centralized exchanges, it is not devoid of risk, at least in theory. As Terra Money noted last year, liquid staking appears analogous to asset-backed securities in a sense that “both create a new layer of abstraction that tends to make people care less about the health of the underlying assets, something that we’ve also seen before during the transition from physical delivery to paper delivery in the futures market.”  Further, a validator can short the staking derivative token when found malicious, thereby profiting from the decline in the price of the token. “Theoretically that’s possible,” Lido said, adding that its validator set includes only validators who have good reputations.",POSITIVE,ETH | LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | LDO,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/02/lido-dominates-booming-market-for-ethereum-20-staking-derivatives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/794c2b9aa98f3d80b0eb6f4f30fb823de45ac241-1300x861.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Perhaps even more impressively, the Loot community now counts among its ranks an all-star list of Web 3 founders, builders and investors, including executives from projects including Aave, Axie Infinity and Fractional Art – many of whom are building new projects on top of the original drop in an effort to expand the “Loot-verse,” as Aave founder Stani Kulechov puts it:  While some believe the project signals the genesis of an open-source fantasy metaverse, others – including the founder himself – are worried the sky-high prices might be the latest sign of an unsustainable NFT bubble and could end up deterring more would-be players than not.  Free launch  With a simple tweet, Hofmann kicked off the Loot run last Friday.  The project had no front-end interface, and users had to directly interact with the minting contract in order to obtain the NFTs. Hofmann charged no mint fee and the NFTs do not include royalties – users only had to pay for the Ethereum network transaction fee to claim them.  While there was initial speculation that Loot may be a part of Hofmann’s forthcoming projects Supdrive, an “on-chain game console,” and Sugar, an on-chain game, Hofmann specified in the Supdrive Discord channel shortly after launch that Loot was “not related.”  Hofmann did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.  Despite clearly being a side project, a community quickly formed around Loot. Within hours there was a dedicated Discord channel, Twitter handle and even token-gated communities around certain items – social channels that could only be entered if users could prove they held a Loot NFT with a “Divine Robe” item.  In the following days, the “floor price,” or lowest price at which you can obtain an NFT for a given project, rose as high as 7.5 ETH, or $28,000. The floor currently sits at 5.25 ETH.  Read more: Why Everyone in NFTs Is Suddenly Talking About Price ‘Floors’  Developer ecosystem  While the rapid value accrual is impressive, the list of complementary projects is where Loot truly stands out. An expanding set of related NFT drops are forming what appears to be the early stages of a full game ecosystem.  On Tuesday night, Fractional Art founder and noted NFT collector Andy Chorlian released Ability Score (For Adventurers), a “Dungeons & Dragons”-style set of stats designed to add another character creation-style element to an adventurer’s Loot. Like the original Loot drop, Ability Score was free aside from the gas charge, and holders of Loot were each entitled to a single Score.  Chorlian confirmed he programmed and launched the drop “in 25 minutes.”  Chorlian told CoinDesk in an interview that the open-source nature of the project is what makes it special.  “What is cool about Loot and its new derivatives is the push to have them be unopinionated and fully on-chain. It makes it so that anyone can build games/art/lore without having to worry that one day it will go away,” he said via Twitter.  In a blog post on Wednesday, Darren Lau of crypto investment firm Not3Lau Capital argued that the simplicity of the project has galvanized and inspired the Web 3 community.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Lau said that Loot is similar to “the perfect writing prompt.”  “[Loot is] a minimum viable product that anybody can take up and expand upon, limited only by their collective imaginations,” he said. “The speed of which builders have flocked towards Loot has been astounding, incensed by the possibility of building something all together.”  Read more: ‘Rare Pepe’ Steeped in Bitcoin History Fetches $500K on NFT Market OpenSea  Other related projects now include cities, banquets, characters, weapon descriptions and multiple artistic renderings.  However, in the Cambrian explosion of related efforts, the project is showing some signs of having jumped the shark – one drop is called Diccs (For Adventurers), a project that gives statistics on the nature of each adventurer’s genitalia.  Likewise, copycat projects have emerged in full force sporting varying degrees of promise, including randomly generated soccer players similar to those seen in the popular Football Manager video game series:  While it’s too early to say this will be the beginning of a text-based NFT trend or a flash in the pan, more Loot-inspired projects appear to be emerging every hour.  Even in a space known for coordination and rapid iteration the pace of development since the initial drop less than a week ago has been torrid, with some industry veterans referring to the progress as “insane.”  Prices and players  Despite the number of developers devoting time to the Loot-verse, some have wondered whether the eye-popping prices may keep casual players away.  Rainbow Wallet co-founder Mike Demarais said Tuesday on Twitter the high price tag for a Loot NFT may prove to be a barrier. Hofmann responded, saying that “you shouldn’t need an NFT to play anything:”  Wednesday morning, however, Hofmann announced the launch of “synthetic Loot” – a contract that gives all Ethereum address holders the ability to generate a synthetic NFT.  The synthetic cannot be traded, sold or transferred, but can be used by game makers to ensure that anyone can play a hypothetical game utilizing the original Loot drop with just an Ethereum address.  Some observers remain worried that Loot prices represent a speculative bubble.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Fiskantes, a self-described “Crypto Degen and Venture Communist” at Zee Prime Capital, said that the success of the project now hinges on the various drops forming together in a functioning world.  “Loot floor pamped quite hard and is currently supported by the novelty, high expectations, promise of community-driven development and future drop optionality,” Fiskantes told CoinDesk via Twitter DM, adding:  “It remains to be seen whether it will reach escape velocity. That can only happen if Loot and its derivative drops will start being connected in a meaningful way to create a coherent ecosystem that’s fun to engage with. In the meantime we can expect many low-effort copycats.”  Editor’s note: This reporter minted and subsequently sold Loot NFTs on the day of the launch.

42396910,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT86WF,1630610626,‘Crypto Dad’ Giancarlo to Quit BlockFi’s Board After 4 Months,"Former chief U.S. commodities regulator Christopher Giancarlo has resigned from BlockFi’s board of directors after only four months, CoinDesk has learned.  It was not immediately clear why Giancarlo is leaving the cryptocurrency lender’s board. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Shortly after being contacted by CoinDesk for this story, BlockFi issued a press release saying Giancarlo has been replaced by Ellen-Blair Chube. BlockFi said Giancarlo “will continue to provide strategic counsel to the firm in an advisory role.”  “Crypto Dad,” as the Digital Dollar Project co-founder was known during his tenure as chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), was the BlockFi board’s first independent director.  His unexpected exit comes at a critical juncture for BlockFi.  Turbulence  It is simultaneously fighting a legal onslaught, recalibrating from a messy $500 million funding round and strategizing for a stock market debut that BlockFi’s Series E investors were told could come as soon as 2022.  The legal issues plaguing BlockFi’s interest-bearing crypto accounts are likely the company’s most pressing challenge. Multiple U.S. states alleged in July that the company’s flagship BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA) were unregistered securities, including regulators in BlockFi’s home state of New Jersey.  BlockFi has warned customers it could be forced to stop onboarding new interest accounts “worldwide” if it does not resolve the New Jersey case. A thrice-delayed cease-and-desist order takes effect on Sept. 30.  Torrents of bad press sent BlockFi into crisis mode just as it was finalizing a blockbuster funding round at a nearly $5 billion valuation. Lead investor Third Point LLC soon pulled out, according to venture capital reporter Eric Newcomer.  One month later and the independent director is jumping ship, too.  “If someone independent is leaving the board, that’s a huge signal,” said Matthew Semadeni, a professor at Arizona State University who studies corporate governance.  Stepping down  Giancarlo’s stature as a former regulator was a likely plus for BlockFi, Semadeni said, explaining that companies sometimes choose independent directors who “lend legitimacy to the board.”  Giancarlo’s April arrival certainly brought gravitas into the boardroom: With no BlockFi equity, he became the only independent voice among company insiders and investors. BlockFi described Giancarlo’s addition at the time as part of a board expansion to ensure a “public-market ready governance structure.”  With Giancarlo out, BlockFi is betting that Chube, a managing director at William Blair, is more eager to stick around.  “It’s like somebody putting an offer on a home,” Semadeni said of Giancarlo’s brief tenure, “doing the inspection, taking a look at the inspection and saying, ‘Yeah, I’ll pass on the house.’”  UPDATE (Sept. 1, 15:21 UTC): Adds information from a BlockFi announcement issued as this story was being published.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/01/crypto-dad-giancarlo-to-quit-blockfis-board-after-4-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecd8bc78b30c2d7231eefae866fd56ad21275877-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report by The Information on Wednesday, Zhao said “Binance.US is just going to do what Coinbase did” by following in the footsteps of Brian Armstrong’s exchange.  The move to go public would be a boon for the embattled Binance brand, with several countries having announced investigations into or published warnings against Binance.  A spokesperson for Binance confirmed with CoinDesk that Zhao had revealed a projected timeline during an interview with the publication and underscored his response as being dependent on market factors.  Asked during the interview about a clear sense of what the timing would be for Binance.US’s initial public offering, Zhao said it depended on the business’ growth.  “So if the business can grow consistently over the next three years, then three years should be sufficient for an IPO,” he said. “If there’s a prolonged bear market for, I don’t know, maybe three or five years, then it may be a little bit longer.”  Zhao had first brought the idea that its U.S. affiliate was eyeing an IPO during his time at the Redefine Tomorrow event in July. The timeline is highly dependent on a number of factors, including regulatory approval.  Binance.US is also eyeing the completion of a large private funding round within the next two months that would see the exchange’s CEO reduce control of the U.S. affiliate’s board, according to the report.  Earlier this year, the CEO said parent Binance had no plans to go public, citing comfort with its overall growth and cash reserves.

The ADA price rose as high as $3.09 before slipping to around $2.94 at press time.  The latest rally came as lead developer IOHK, headed by Charles Hoskinson, tweeted that the Cardano test network had successfully deployed smart contracts capability and that the focus would now turn to the “Alonzo” upgrade of the main network, which he said is still “on track” to be deployed on Sept. 12.  Cardano is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap ($93.7 billion), behind bitcoin ($934 billion) and Ethereum’s ether ($439 billion). The ADA token has soared 1,583% this year, versus 69% for bitcoin and 417% for ether.  Cardano is considered one of the so-called “Ethereum-killers” – fast, programmable blockchains that might eventually unseat Ethereum as the leader in decentralized finance (DeFi) as well as in other use cases like non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.

42410974,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggttXI,1630608576,Record Doge NFT Sale Highlights Growing Demand for Fractionalization,"Just three months after a non-fungible token (NFT) representing an image of the original Shiba Inu dogecoin meme sold for about $4 million, the NFT is now valued at more than $225 million after part of its ownership sold for over 11,000 ether.  Investors were able to boost the price of the doge NFT to a record high for NFTs in such a short time by fractionalizing it into nearly 17 billion tokens named DOG with 20% of the supply for sale via a 24-hour auction ended Thursday.  The event reflects investors’ rapidly growing demand for fractionalized ownership of NFTs, a new, easier way to participate in the increasingly pricey and volatile NFT market. The trend has been rising in recent months, although critics have questioned potential risks around this NFT innovation.  In fractionalization, the NFT owner deposits the NFT into a vault on one of the NFT fractionalization platforms, which allows them to mint ERC-20 tokens. The NFT owner also determines the total supply of the minted ERC-20 tokens. Unlike NFTs, which usually apply Ethereum’s ERC-721 token standard, the ERC-20 tokens are fungible and can be traded, sent and received on smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain.  NFT fractionalization “gives wider access to [the] community, and can help make NFTs productive assets,” Delphi Digital co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Anil Lulla said.  PleasrDAO, a group of investors who bought the doge NFT in June for 1,696 ether (about $4 million at the time), auctioned 20% – nearly 3.4 million DOG tokens – of the total $DOG supply on the decentralized fundraising platform Miso. The group fractionalized the doge NFT through a platform called Fractional Art. PleasrDAO still retains majority ownership of $DOG.  The investors behind the DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, include high-powered venture capitalists Su Zhu of Three Arrows Capital, Dragonfly’s Tom Schmidt and Compound’s Robert Leshner.  Fractionalized NFTs have sold at staggeringly high prices before. Another doge meme-related NFT sold for more than $86 million in late August after it was fractionalized into tokens called feisty doge NFT (NFD).  “I am really excited to see more work done on community ownership of internet culture and history,” Andy Chorlian, founder of Fractional Art, told CoinDesk. Fractional Art facilitated the fractionalization of both NFTs associated with doge, and the platform is backed by Paradigm, Delphi Digital and other investors.  While the NFT market has boomed this year, with sales hovering over 50,000 per week, sale prices have dropped 60% since early August, according to NonFungible.com, and some observers have even suggested the NFT phenomenon is a bubble.  Even after selling his NFT “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” for $69 million earlier this year, artist Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, called the market “extremely speculative.” “This is for people who are looking to take some risks because a lot of this stuff will absolutely go to zero,” he told The New York Times.  NFT fractionalization aims to reduce the risks around NFT pricing.  “Imagine if an individual wanted to get a loan based on the value of their CryptoPunk. You need to find a buyer and whoever provides you the loan is going to charge you some premium based on the risk associated with the fact that they might not be able to sell it very quickly,” Mason Nystrom, research analyst at Messari, explained. “Now, in an ideal world where Punks were fractionalized and therefore had greater access to buyers, then the risk to the person giving the loan would be less and the premium paid by the Punk owner would also be less.”  But like all innovations, fractional ownership of NFTs also has risks and has faced criticism, particularly the technology, which is still in its early stage.  By locking an NFT in a vault, the NFT fractionalization issuer has to bear the risk of potential hacks on smart contacts, said Dragos Dunica, co-founder of NFT data site DappRadar.  However, the fractionalization issuer often maintains the majority ownership of the NFT, which means the minority owners need to be aware of potential “pump and dump” schemes.  When the Feisty doge was fractionalized and sold in August, some NFT market observers called it a “scam.” Blockchain data suggested the initial owner of the Feisty doge NFT work removed liquidity from the NFD/ETH trading pair.  “You’re about to see EVERYTHING fractionalized and repackaged as an ERC-20 token that’s suddenly not a s**tcoin,” Twitter user @0xShual, who discovered the problem of the fractionalized Feisty doge NFT, tweeted dryly.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | SHIB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/02/record-doge-nft-sale-highlights-growing-demand-for-fractionalization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c9fb2ad8810d46c2c69d3ea3e1f26dc47d101e8-1024x687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the time of writing, ETH stands at $3,782 with a 6.7% profit in the daily chart. The second cryptocurrency by market cap has been outperforming Bitcoin. The price of BTC seems stuck in the $48,000 to $52,000 range and, should it sustain these levels, ETH could continue to benefit in the short term. Investment firm Delphi Digital claimed that ETH has broken out of a &apos;Multi-year long-term wedge&apos;, as seen in the chart below. Since funding rates across derivates are low, the firm expects Ethereum to push further into its previous all-time highs.

42424672,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVk7h,1630604345,Are DAOs Socialist?,"The Ethereum blockchain and surrounding infrastructure are increasingly seen as public goods.  Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable means we cannot exclude others from using the good. Examples include natural resources like the air, but also produced goods and services like public radio or the police. Non-rivalrous means in using them we don’t deplete them for others.  Dr. Paul J. Dylan-Ennis is an assistant professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin. Crypto Questioned is a forum to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.  Funding the upkeep of the Ethereum blockchain and its infrastructure is a longstanding concern of Vitalik Buterin and has been addressed pragmatically through the use of quadratic funding in Gitcoin.  The Ethereum blockchain seems an incontrovertible public good. Yet, the Other Internet collective has argued the Ethereum blockchain cannot be considered a public good because the public served is not a public in the broad sense, but large holders known as whales in niche areas like decentralized finance (DeFi). Intriguingly, Buterin rejected their account in a recent post and suggested Ethereum serves a much wider audience than DeFi.  The question of what is a public good in Ethereum remains unsettled. This is even true in practical terms. The issue has consistently arisen because some Gitcoin grants straddle the line between infrastructure and venture. While layer 2 solutions are funded as public goods uncontroversially there is some debate as to whether a podcast about Ethereum is a public good? Or what about a Twitter account disseminating updates about Ethereum?  I think the “whether to fund” problem rests on the lack of clarity regarding the term “public good.” The economics definition drawn from Elinor Ostrom – non-excludable, non-rivalrous – is cited often (as here), but it’s not super helpful in our context.  The Other Internet collective suggest we need to define public goods in a more expansive sense than the economic one and propose first expanding what we mean by public – to now mean the wider community beyond your immediate “squad” – and good to mean a shared value, specifically one people recognize as reflective of their own. In particular, this good should contain a longterm vision of what the community wants to bring about.  Scott Moore, of Gitcoin, argues we can find out what constitutes a public good by identifying what our “shared problems” are. A shared problem renders explicit what implicitly connects a set of shareholders. This lets us recognize we are not disconnected individuals driven purely by economic concerns. Crucially, hinted at here is the question of what would it mean to build with more than the cryptocurrency space in mind. Under the surface, I believe this is what Buterin in public philosopher mode recognizes as lacking in Ethereum: the long term vision of what all this is for.  The public goods discussion is a discussion about what are the “positive externalities” that could be developed by a cryptoculture thinking about the world beyond its own borders. The example used of negative externalities is Web 2.0 social networks that trundled on without any regard for their effects on privacy, disinformation, disconnection or mental health. We should not push blindly outwards like they did just because we can, but try to develop the Ethereum ecosystem consciously and with an eye toward the public beyond ourselves, generating positive externalities.  My position is Ethereum has an unconscious political bias I call mutualist minarchism.  Read more: Ethereum’s Political Philosophy Explained | Paul Dylan-Ennis  It is mutualist because the community emphasizes cooperativism and collaboration, but also minarchist as it develops new minimalist forms of governance, in that it creates decentralized analogues to the functions of the traditional state. These include alternate forms of finance in DeFi, art and culture in non-fungible tokens (NFT), and organization with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). These are social, economic and political ambitions but without a clearly identified politics.  It is a curious state of affairs that we can’t quite articulate what long-term shared values would represent Ethereum as public goods in the expansive sense. Decentralization is our tactic, that is clear, but decentralization for what end?  The answer to Ethereum’s political ambiguity is resolved, fittingly, from DAO culture upward.  In DAOs, however, we can espie a possible political position emerging that can help us answer this question. In the Ethereum ecosystem, we don’t typically encounter socialists/communists or even the right libertarians populating bitcoin culture. Instead, we encounter venture entrepreneurs with a strong inclination toward a public goods philosophy.  There is an online meme now about whether DAOs are socialists or not, but this probably constrains us a little too much by traditional definitions.  Instead, in DAOs public goods are an aperture into an attitude rooted fundamentally in capitalism but not the neoliberal fog of ultra-individualistic capitalism. The sense and feel for entrepreneurship remains, the venture, but there are too many shared problems in our society to discount the centrality of a shared commons. This produces venture commonism: Web 3.0 entrepreneurship with commonist characteristics.  This more sharply encapsulates a political ambition, a vision of ad hoc decentralized groups (what I jokingly call “Dunbar’s”) that spontaneously form to tackle manageable tasks that improve the lot of a shared commons. The answer to what a public goods value might look like is: We want to produce a society respectful of individualism, but contextualizes the individual within a set of shared communal problems. One value might then be “restoration of community” as a higher-level version of Nathan Schneider’s “exit to community.”  The Ethereum political project could then be reimagined as the restoration of community through venture commonism.

42394445,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdZ4j,1630600805,A Dictionary for Degens,"GM. Ape. Liquidity. Those words might not mean what you think – if you’re talking to an NFT degen.  It’s not easy making sense of the memeification of asset markets, the trend toward semi-coordinated groups investing in down-on-their-luck retailers like GameStop and so-ironic-it’s-not-ironic cryptocurrencies like dogecoin.  This column originally appeared in The Node, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter bringing you the biggest crypto news and ideas. Sign up here.  There’s the sometimes impenetrable slang, of course. But also the risk that a core group of insiders will buy in early and dump on retail followers. It’s essentially the problem of knowing when an audience has become a community. Ironically, it’s the slang that can help.  Yesterday, the pseudonymous non-fungible token (NFT) trader and influencer punk6529 wrote down a list of terms commonly used on Twitter among the Bored Apes, Punks and Penguins. It’s a dictionary for degens.  “We have a lot of newcomers to NFT Twitter. This is a thread to teach them our ways,” they wrote. Indeed, NFTs are back in the spotlight. Celebrities have swapped their profile pics for cartoon headshots. New projects launch and gain stream weekly. Billions worth of digital assets trade.  Obviously, NFTs are more than a technological or financial movement. From the early experiments of recapturing wealth from classic internet memes to art house power brokers like Sotheby’s and Christie’s moving into the scene, this is an evolving cultural event.  And so, an argot has formed around an asset class. Beyond a key characteristic of any ingroup – adopting a non-traditional language at the expense of outsiders – it’s interesting to consider how the structure of everyday speech influences our view of the world. I encourage you to read the full list of ~70 terms (complete with examples of usage in sentences!), but here are a few quick thoughts.  While the list is essentially unorganized, it’s notable that punk6529 started off with “gm,” short for good morning. It speaks to the welcoming intentions of making an informal community dictionary, and possibly the friendliness of the NFT community at large. That cultural openness parallels the real innovation of NFT markets that just about anyone, anywhere can access. It’s a community with arms wide open.  “We say good morning to each other because we are a friendly happy optimistic global community and it is nice to say good morning to your friends as you start your day,” Punk6529 said.  Many of the terms are taken straight from the larger crypto scene or beyond, showing how subgroups self-divide. Crypto itself has become so fragmented among different blockchains, use cases and industries that it’s nearly impossible to keep up.  The same terms you might be familiar with from Bitcoin Talk or traditional finance also take on slightly new characteristics in a new context. Take “liquidity.” For punk6529 it means your “Available ETH to buy JPGs.”  It’s sometimes said that crypto suffers from shallow liquidity, but in NFTs, “This is an impossible state of being. Any available ETH converts into JPGs immediately so everyone is in a state of perpetual illiquidity.”  See also: How NFTs Fit Into DeFi | David Z. Morris  The community has also developed something of an immune response to critics. There’s “Right Click Save As,” used ironically to counter the most common criticism that digital assets cannot be rare if anyone can download an image of a Weird Whale from a web browser. Similarly, people are trading and minting “JPEGs,” a way to reclaim an insulting way to refer to NFTs (even if the underlying asset is a GIF, PNG, audio file, video file or computer game).  In traditional art, calling a work “derivative” is an insult. In NFTs, “The intelligent view on derivatives is that they are fine, enhance the brand of the original and everyone should stay cool about them.”  Then there are the terms no one can define: “Gang Gang”  “Nobody can explain it well. Basically frens with the same JPGs as you, but I am not thrilled with my explanation either.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/02/a-dictionary-for-degens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5816ffed20e935ad256ecb1e5ab83e6079285108-3312x2207.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396924,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT86h4,1630600214,Stablecoins Are ‘Pretending’ to Be Currencies: ECB’s Lagarde,"Cryptocurrencies backed by fiat money are assets and should not be mistaken for currencies, said Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB).  “Stablecoins are pretending to be a coin but, in fact, it’s completely associated with an actual currency. For instance, some of them are saying that they can be used for transactions, but the value will be exactly aligned to the dollar,” Lagarde said, referring to stablecoin issuers.  Lagarde made the remarks during a 30-minute interview on Tuesday while discussing the “World’s Greatest Challenges” as part of the Time 100 Talks series with the world’s most influential people. World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab hosted the discussion.  “I want to focus on one aspect of this revolution, which is digital currencies – or should I say, decentralized digital currencies like bitcoin,” Schwab said.  Calling a ‘spade a spade’  Schwab asked Lagarde if decentralized currencies can contribute to financial stability, or if she believes them to be a threat.  Lagarde took the opportunity to clarify her view that, first, it is important to properly define and categorize crypto assets for what they are.  “They present themselves as currencies, which they are not. So I think that we should all in the finance sector and at the regulatory level call a spade a spade,” Lagarde said.  She went on to suggest that stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies that are pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, fit this description.  “I think very recent history has [shown] that those reserve currencies were not always available and as liquid as they were intended to be,” Lagarde said.  Lagarde may have been referring to the recent revelation that 49% of the “U.S. dollar reserves” backing the Tether-issued USDT stablecoin were actually made up of unspecified commercial paper. Since then, U.S. Federal Reserve official Eric Rosengren called Tether a “challenge to financial stability.”  USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle and Coinbase, similarly revealed that 9% of its reserves are made up of commercial paper.  Stablecoin issuers have to guarantee that users can exchange their coins for dollars at any time, Lagarde said, adding that issuers have to back up their coins with as many dollars as they have coins.  “That needs to be checked, supervised and regulated so that consumers and users of those devices can actually be guaranteed against potential misrepresentation,” Lagarde said.  Meeting the demand for a digital euro  Shwab also asked Lagarde about the ECB’s plan to launch a digital euro in the next four years.  “What would be the benefits of such a move, and what might the pitfalls be? Would it strengthen or weaken the position of the euro on a global level?” Schwab asked.  Lagarde responded the ECB will be kicking off a two-year experiment so the institution will be ready to meet the demand for a digital euro, should it exist.  “At the European Central Bank, we believe that we should be ready and have the technology available in order to respond to customer demands. If customers prefer to use digital currency rather than have bank notes and cash available, it should be available,” Lagarde said.  The two-year investigation was announced in July and it’s set to kick off in October.  Lagarde also said the experiment will focus on a number of things including the availability of a digital euro (in the same way that cash is available), safety and security, along with user friendliness, affordability and ensuring the digital euro is accepted not only in the euro area but around the world.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/02/stablecoins-are-pretending-to-be-currencies-ecbs-lagarde,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f11f290fa4df753a1c157262c525e51b435d8e5-3816x2249.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company has opened a waiting list for customers, who will be able to earn up to a 5% annual rate by converting their ether holdings into ETH2 tokens, which can be used for staking, the exchange said Thursday.  The tokens represent the right to withdraw staked ether once Ethereum 2.0 goes live.  The 5% rate is based on the estimated Ethereum 2.0 network rate and will change as more ETH2 is staked.  Coinbase has offered staking rewards since 2019, when it debuted the feature for Tezos. This was extended to Cosmos a year later.  ETH2 tokens are being launched to U.K. customers as a result of “unprecedented demand,” according to Coinbase’s announcement.  To run a validator for Ethereum 2.0 costs a stake of 32 ETH ($120,000). Companies like Coinbase are running validators and offering staking-as-a-service, thereby allowing clients to participate in the staking process and earn a share of the validators’ rewards without having to front the full amount.

FTT hit $66.08 after markets opened in the U.S. on Wednesday, according to data from Messari. With a market capitalization of $6.19 billion, FTT is the second-largest centralized exchange token, only behind Binance’s BNB.  The pending acquisition of LedgerX positions FTX.US to offer crypto futures, swaps, puts and calls to retail traders. It’s the latest sign of the growing ambitions of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Hong Kong-based crypto empire.  “There’s probably some momentum [because] we’re making quite a few strategic acquisitions at the moment,” Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at FTX, told CoinDesk.  Read more: FTX.US to Buy LedgerX in Bid for US Crypto Derivatives  LedgerX has several key licenses allowing it to offer bitcoin and ether derivatives in the U.S., making it easier and faster for FTX to enter the U.S. market with such products. Founded in 2017, FTX is known globally for its crypto derivatives.  Analysts previously told CoinDesk that FTX’s acquisition of Blockfolio in May 2020 made FTX “very retail-friendly.” Blockfolio, which was rebranded to “FTX” in July, is a portfolio tracking app primarily serving a retail customer base.  Cheesman also said FTX has benefited from rising concerns around some of its competitors.  Without mentioning the specific exchanges, Cheesman said one of the exchanges has been “under the spotlight” over regulatory concerns. (We’ll name it for him: Binance.)  Meanwhile, Chinese crypto exchanges including Huobi and OKEx have tightened their derivatives rules amid China’s renewed efforts to rein in crypto trading.  It all points to why FTT may be surging: Traders see such tokens as a way to bet on an exchange’s growth.  “We’ve kind of had a bit of gain from each,” Cheesman said.  Rising fortunes  According to data from the Coinbase-owned Skew, FTX is the No. 3 crypto exchange by bitcoin futures open interest, just behind Binance and Bybit.  On the bitcoin spot market, FTX has also gained market share against its more well-known and established competitors such as Binance and Coinbase.  Data from blockchain data firm Kaiko shows that since November 2020, on a percentage basis, FTX’s bitcoin spot volume versus the total volume has surged from 2.5% to 15.5%, an indication that the exchange known for its derivatives products has also attracted many traders to its spot market.  “FTX Global currently does not service U.S. traders but the exchange’s U.S. affiliate is aggressively ramping up marketing efforts, partnerships and regulatory relationships, which could pose a strong competitive threat to Coinbase,” Kaiko wrote in its weekly report dated Aug. 30.

42413872,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZXKDW,1630598862,Bitcoin Rises Above $50K After Ether’s Biggest Single-Day Gain in 6 Weeks,"Bitcoin is gathering steam in the wake of ether’s rally to a 3 1/2-month high on Wednesday.  The top cryptocurrency by market value crossed the $50,000 mark for the first time since Aug. 23 and is trading 2.7% higher on the day at press time, CoinDesk 20 data show.  The advance comes a day after ether, the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, jumped above $3,800 to reach its highest level since mid-May. Ether ended the day with an 11% gain, the biggest single-day rise since July 21, and analysts foresee continued advances.  Bitcoin is also looking north, with data pointing to bullish bias among large investors. The Commitments of Traders (COT) report published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Aug. 27 showed asset managers holding record long exposure of $165 million. “The net exposure of asset managers is positive for the first time since April, indicating that the institutions have turned bullish on bitcoin,” Arcane Research noted in a weekly report published Tuesday.  Some observers are citing the recent decline in bitcoin balances held on the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase exchange as evidence of fresh demand from large investors.  “Coinbase buyers are back,” William Clemente, lead insights analyst at Blockware Solutions, tweeted early today along with a chart from Glassnode showing the number of bitcoin balances falling by 32,000 BTC since Aug. 23. As of Wednesday, Coinbase held 709,695 BTC, the lowest number since 2017.  Coinbase outflows are often taken to represent institutional demand, as the exchange offers custody services directly integrated with its over-the-counter (OTC) desk. Institutions typically conduct transactions over the counter to avoid influencing the spot-market price. However, some observers are skeptical of the bullish Coinbase theory. CoinDesk’s Galen Moore noted in April that stablecoins have replaced bitcoin as the dominant quote currency and outflows represent that trend.  That said, other blockchain metrics point to renewed accumulation by investors. In a report published Tuesday, blockchain data company Santiment said the number of bitcoin held by addresses with between 100 and 10,000 BTC has climbed over the past week, signaling renewed confidence among some bitcoin whales, or larger investors.  “After a shaky start to the month, the combined balance of these holders has increased by roughly 30,000 BTC [worth $1.5 billion] in the last seven days, and now amounts to 48.95% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply,” Santiment noted. Address metrics are not perfect indicators because a single investor can hold multiple addresses.  On-chain supply dynamics warrant a price of $58,000, according to Blockware Solutions’ Clemente. From a technical analysis standpoint, bulls need to establish a foot hold above $50,000 for a move toward the next resistance at that level.

This happened after the hijack of the website of Banksy, a popular artist, for the promotion of a fake NFT auction. Nevertheless, almost the entire funds have been recovered. On August 31, Pransky identified one of Banksy&apos;s official website pages promoting the auction for an NFT on OpenSea, a popular marketplace. Though he disclosed his misgiving for the genuineness of the token, Pransky decided to join in the auction. He placed the highest bid by 87 Ethereum ($304,500) to nearly 100 Ethereum tokens.

42413867,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZXK5a,1630597940,"With Buterin Advising, Could Dogecoin Jump to Proof-of-Stake?","When the people behind dogecoin, the famous dog-depicting cryptocurrency worth $39 billion, announced last month a reboot of the Doge Foundation with the addition of Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin and Tesla representative Jared Birchall as advisers, it got tongues wagging in the crypto space.  The reinstatement of the foundation is great news for DOGE lovers because it formalizes development work on the cryptocurrency. But the inclusion of Buterin and Birchall also suggests a specific future-proofing of the dogecoin roadmap when it comes to crypto mining.  Dogecoin, like bitcoin and the current iteration of ethereum, relies on energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) mining. For now, at least.  “DOGE is going to be exploring proof-of-stake (PoS), probably with some kind of parallel chain,” a source with knowledge of the matter told CoinDesk. “But there’s no ETA and some internal friction.”  Buterin is overseeing Ethereum’s transition from PoW to PoS, a consensus mechanism that is not reliant on accumulating specialized mining computers.  Buterin recently voiced his feelings about a possible “switch” for dogecoin:  Much convincing to do  CoinDesk asked dogecoin core developer Ross Nicoll and community leader Gary Lachance for their views on the idea that DOGE might add the more environmentally friendly consensus system to its roadmap.  “Personally, I would love to see [PoS] explored,” Nicoll said in an interview. “But I couldn’t tell you when that would be, and I’d have to convince some other people. So you can certainly say, for me personally, absolutely. For the foundation, there’s a lot of people to convince.”  Dogecoin launched in late 2013 as a fork of litecoin (LTC), and therefore uses the same consensus mechanism, PoW and the same hashing function, Scrypt. In 2014, dogecoin’s developers decided to adopt merged mining, leveraging litecoin’s mining pools, the technical term for which is Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW).  Prior to dogecoin rallying in price, it was viewed as a byproduct of litecoin mining (today DOGE has a market cap of about $39 billion, versus LTC’s $12 billion, according to CoinMarketCap).  Herding dogs  Dogecoin’s move to merged mining can be viewed as a concession to the energy efficiency argument that has become a central theme in crypto today.  However, Lachance, who also runs popular community efforts like Doge Disco, believes PoW and bitcoin energy usage is more nuanced than some of the reports suggest.  “There have been a lot of assertions made about how bitcoin burns as much electricity as Argentina or whatever,” said Lachance. “I mean, it’s a nuanced discussion, whether or not that much energy is being burned. I’d love to see a transition to systems that are not depleting the environment. But I think it’s definitely important to have a stable foundation. To me, that’s the most important thing.”  Read more: ‘Silliness Is Next to Godliness’: Why Doge Still Thrives  It’s also worth noting no single cryptocurrency that has chosen to adopt merged mining has ever shifted away from AuxPoW. A look at Ethereum’s transition to PoS shows the level of complexity involved and raises all sorts of questions, said Nicoll, such as how that migration might look for dogecoin.  “There has to be some sort of path,” especially for the network’s current miners, Nicoll said, adding:  “What that means is we’re going to have maybe a maximum number of blocks per period of time that can be proof-of-work. And that decreases to give you time to recoup your hardware costs, but we discourage you from buying new hardware.”  Back to the fun stuff  For now there are other priorities to consider, such as completing an important reduction in the cost of transaction fees, and simply getting the foundation to a point where funds for development work can be disbursed.  The intent is to make the Dogecoin Foundation’s treasury fully transparent, said Nicoll, and current discussions include using a developer “tips jar,” which started out as “beer and pizza” money, but is now worth about $6 million. For now, some 250,000 DOGE (approximately $75,000) has been moved from the tip jar to pay for setting up the foundation, he said.  Of paramount importance, said Lachance, is to reinforce DOGE as the people’s currency: easy, fun and versatile.  “So this is where the lowering of the fees is huge. For other currencies, it might not be that big of an event,” Lachance said, adding:  “The fee right now is 1 DOGE, which is 30, 40 cents Canadian, just to send a DOGE to someone. So when that becomes 100 times cheaper, then we can get back to the culture of tipping and giving where you can send someone a bunch of DOGE and it costs basically nothing and it’s fun to do so.”",POSITIVE,DOGE | LTC,BTC | DOGE | ETH | LTC | MINING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/02/with-vitalik-advising-could-dogecoin-jump-to-proof-of-stake,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e378e929f1d453c8b121acafdcc9a66eee6165b0-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin was quite challenging in the early years until exchanges stepped in. This barrier to mainstream adoption is only getting lower as more financial institutions are joining the crypto industry, including banks. For the first time, a United States-based banking institution, Vast Bank, will provide customers the option to purchase, sell, and custody cryptocurrencies through their regular bank account.

42413855,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZXJf8,1630591248,UXD Raises $3M to Bring Algorithmic Stablecoins to Solana,"UXD Protocol, an algorithmic stablecoin that automatically generates interest and is minted on the Solana blockchain, has raised $3 million in seed funding led by Multicoin Capital.  UXD, which announced Thursday that it’s launching into testnet phase, is also backed by Alameda Research, Defiance Capital, CMS Holdings, Solana Foundation, Mercurial Finance, Solana founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal and Saber founder Dylan Macalinao.  The $120 billion stablecoin market is beset by opaque asset backing, a reliance on centralized banking and capital inefficient methods, making the quest for a fully decentralized and highly scalable “algocoin” something of a Holy Grail.  Of the current algorithmic stablecoin crop, UXD claims to be the first to be backed by delta-neutral positions, a hedging strategy from portfolio management that uses multiple positions with balancing positive and negative deltas – the degree to which an option is exposed to shifts in the price of the underlying asset.  Read more: The Quest for a Truly Decentralized Stablecoin  It’s worth noting that stablecoins that automatically work like a savings account are not a new concept; for instance, Origin launched Origin Dollars, or OUSD, back in September 2020, a stablecoin whose reserves leverage decentralized finance (DeFi) so that balances grow wherever it resides, no staking or account required.  In the case of UXD, the delta-neutral position is long one BTC spot position, and short one BTC perpetual-swap position, explained UXD Protocol founder Kento Inami.  “If you have a hedged position, and you don’t make or lose any money, that’s basically what a stablecoin does,” he told CoinDesk, adding:  “There’s also a native yield for UXD, because when you create a delta-neutral position, you receive the funding rate from the perpetual swap when the price of the perpetual swap is higher than the spot price. This will go directly to the UXD holder’s wallet, which has never been done before.”  The yield on UXD depends on market conditions, as the funding rate is variable, Inami said. On average, at current market rates, it should be around 10% APY. Meanwhile, the stablecoin can also be used at the same time for liquidity mining or on lending platforms.  A portion of the yield will be reserved to secure the protocol’s insurance fund in the event that derivatives trade at a discount to spot. For example, if a market is in “backwardation,” the insurance fund is used to compensate depositors and keep the position fully hedged. The insurance fund will begin accumulating once the protocol goes fully live in Q4, and after a governance token sale in October or November, said Inami.  Read more: Solana’s Mango Markets DEX Raises $70M in MNGO Token Sale  Under the hood, the perpetual swap protocol is connected to a decentralized exchange (DEX); to begin with, UDX is working with Mango Markets, the biggest DEX on Solana.  “If the derivative DEX fails, then the UXD will not be backed 100%. And so you’re taking on kind of like the counterparty risk of the derivative DEX,” said Inami.  But in view of the shortcomings of many stablecoins in the market, Inami said he was surprised no other project has so far leveraged delta-neutral positions as a way of pegging.  “I have wondered why no one else has tried it,” Inami said. “I guess the implementation has been difficult because it’s only recently that derivative DEXs came out. But with Mango Markets on Solana we can now create this type of stablecoin.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/02/uxd-raises-3m-to-bring-algorithmic-stablecoins-to-solana,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42424664,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVjrh,1630587249,"India’s Crypto Startups Come of Age, Despite Uncertainty","The Indian crypto ecosystem has seen rising investor interest. India recently ranked second on Chainalysis’s Global Crypto Adoption Index for 2021. Indian blockchain startups have also started acquiring capital flows from global markets for capital generation. Startups that have successfully fundraised recently include Vauld ($25 million led by Valar Ventures), GoSats ($700,000 from Alphabit Fund, Fulgur Ventures, Stacks Accelerator and SBX Capital), Biconomy ($9 million in private funding round led by DACM and Mechanism Capital including other investors), Mudrex ($2.5 million in a seed funding round led by Nexus Partners along with Village Global and prominent angels such as Kunal Shah (CRED), Anand C. (Five9 Inc.) and Anjali Bansal (Avaana Capital), and many others.  Tanvi Ratna, a CoinDesk columnist, is the founder and CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on new policy approaches for digital assets.  The funding garnered by crypto startups in India has crossed the $100 million mark, with India now seeing its first crypto unicorn in CoinDCX and first major protocol play in Polygon. A big reason behind this growth and investor interest is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), which has finally given India’s talented developers a product-market fit for technical and core crypto products.  The global adoption of decentralized finance has been running at its peak with the current total valued locked of around $90 billion gathering developers’ interest globally. The Indian ecosystem is now building products such as privacy stacks, protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEX), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and so forth. DeFi gave Polygon its growth boost as the layer 2 protocol solved challenges faced by Ethereum including heavy fees, low transactions per second and poor user experience.  By facilitating faster and cheaper transactions, the project saw rapid adoption and interest from global investors. This brought attention to Indian projects that were building similar core crypto solutions. In addition, the team behind Polygon has now started providing funding and network support to other blockchain startups in India.  “Arcana Network had a significant helping hand from the team at Polygon guiding them for creation of credibility to the product and developing a network within the ecosystem”, said Aravindh Kumar, co-founder of Arcana Network, a project offering privacy stacks to developers that recently raised $375,000 from Coinbase’s Balaji Srinivasan, Sandeep Naiwal and JD Kanani (founders of Polygon), Kendrick Nguyen (founder and CEO of Republic), and other top angels.  This newfound focus on core crypto development is in stark contrast to the dire situation most startups found themselves in before 2020. Running a crypto exchange was the only feasible business model, and core technology players struggled to attract investment. With the enforcement of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2018 circular that banned Indian banks from dealing with virtual currency, the fundraising ecosystem for existing startups became more difficult.  Indian venture firms and investors always had the fear of their bank account getting seized by regulators. The initial coin offering bubble in 2018 also created a widespread notion of crypto projects being “scams,” an idea also widely shared by regulators in the country. “Most of the banks turned us down thinking of our idea as one of the cryptos dealing scams,” said Mohammed Roshan, co-founder of GoSats, a crypto stacking app.  “Most of us startups began to consider the international market in which the system is legal with high-value generation,” said Darshan Bathija, co-founder and CEO of Vauld, a crypto lending and borrowing platform.  The industry faced restrictions for dealing with banks and financial institutions until March 2020 when the Supreme Court of India lifted the curb imposed by the RBI. The scope of opportunity and growth for startups opened up again along with the commencement of the bull market.  “The fundraising flow from investors to blockchain startups got escalated after bitcoin broke its previous all-time high of $20,000 in December 2020. It was the manifestation of the upcoming bull cycle in the market which global investors didn’t want to miss out,” said Siddhartha Jain, co-founder of DefiDollar, a meta stablecoin index. The surge in the prices of cryptocurrencies escalated the adoption pace in India. Meanwhile, the capital flow by foreign funds also increased which helped startups in building projects.  However, despite the enthusiasm of foreign investors, the participation of Indian venture capitalists and investment funds remains comparatively low. The primary reason being regulatory uncertainties. “The fundraising ecosystem within India has been limited by venture capital firms as they are taking cautious steps in the current scenario of regulatory uncertainty,” said Aniket Jindal, co-founder of Biconomy.  “One can say that the investment approach of global investors is from the long-term perspective with more understanding of the domain. Whereas for Indian investment funds, it might just be restrictive to projected returns and regulatory compliance”, said Darshan Bathija. This might indicate that along with clarity in regulations, Indian investment firms need to have a full appraisal and understanding of a project’s fundamentals.  To counter the bottlenecks of fundraising due to regulatory uncertainty, conventionally settled projects like Polygon are now building their own funds and support systems for emerging projects. At the same time, the whole ecosystem is waiting for India’s crypto bill which will help in understanding the intention of policymakers and government authorities. For India to become a leading center for the blockchain industry, the crypto industry hopes to see progressive regulations from the government soon.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TOKEN SALE,Tanvi Ratna,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/02/indias-crypto-startups-come-of-age-despite-uncertainty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6dbd74648d057509755006b12136459236f961b-2800x1926.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394452,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdZZV,1630585800,Important Conversations to Have About Crypto With Clients,"When we get through all the numbers and metrics that make up our business – AUM, ROI, fees, alpha, beta – what we actually end up doing is having real conversations with clients. We need to understand their situations, risk, goals and needs and discuss possible solutions and strategies.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here.  Whether you are advising on crypto, managing digital asset portfolios or just starting down this journey, the most important part for now will be the new conversations you’ll need to have with clients about crypto. It’s important to remember that this is not only a new asset class, but also a new technology. Your understanding and ability to discuss it with your clients is what takes crypto from media hype and speculation to an investable asset and valuable part of a portfolio.  Here are some of the new conversations you’ll likely be having with clients as digital assets relate to their investments and financial lives.  Custody of digital assets  For quite a while, the main conversation around custody with clients has been explaining why their statement comes from Schwab or Fidelity. Crypto brings additional custodial options that you’ll have to discuss and come to some decisions.  Crypto is really centered on the idea of self-custody, which, in this case, means control over the private keys. “Not your keys, not your crypto” is a regular mantra.  In order to eliminate some of the technical barriers to adoption and investment, we now have institutional custody as an option, with providers such as Gemini, Anchorage and Kingdom Trust. We also have funds and trusts, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) from Grayscale, and Bitwise Crypto Index Fund (BITW) from Bitwise. (Disclosure: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.) These vehicles wrap the digital assets in an easily digestible investment product, which can be held and traded with traditional custodians.  This gives your client options with regard to the custody of their digital assets, which means they look to you for guidance. As the advisor, your job is to understand the technical risks, and how those risks are being offset by any benefits.  You might end up with a single asset, like bitcoin, held in two or three different custodial platforms, based on the investment and use case for each.  Your client can have some bitcoin stored offline (usually referred to as cold storage or a hard wallet), some in a custodial account that earns interest and some in an account you manage and trade for them. One asset, three custodial platforms, all viable.  Fear, uncertainty, doubt (FUD)  Even as we attempt to find more regulatory clarity and build custodial and trading platforms that fit within the current regulatory framework, the values of the underlying digital assets are based on worldwide supply and demand.  The prices can obviously fluctuate wildly, usually generating a call or email from clients who are invested.  This is where your new understanding and skills need to fit in. News in any number of geographic locations – or even a social media post from an influencer or investor – can send the price skyrocketing or crashing. The asset class hasn’t been around long enough for us to know how demand will react over the long term to certain news. Therefore, most guess as to the potential impact of any news, and the prices adjust.  We sometimes refer to these news items, and the requisite price reactions, as FUD – fear, uncertainty and doubt. They manifest even more through the 24/7 use of social media to perpetuate and opine on stories and their effect on crypto prices.  When your client contacts you to ask why the price of bitcoin dropped 15% over the weekend, you’ll have to be prepared with a few points.  First, you go back to your original discussion about the volatility of the asset class, and how you have a certain time horizon in mind.  Next, you can address the issue. You should have some thoughts as to why the price moved the way it did.  Last, based on the first two parts of the conversation, you and your client make a determination as to whether to alter their crypto positions.  Store of value, inflation hedge, and more  We are seeing so many opportunities for new valuation metrics and reasons for allocating to digital assets. Bitcoin is the most widely invested and notable cryptocurrency and usually comes with the store-of-value investment thesis.  In financial planning, we usually talk about preparing for some inflation when considering college or retirement accounts. The number planned for most often is around 2% inflation.  However, we haven’t seen real inflation in 15 years, so we have not had to address the issue in regard to a typical portfolio. Now, with recent money printing, inflation is trending up for the first time since the mid 2000′s, and many large bitcoin investors are using it as their investment thesis.  When your clients hear of another hedge fund giant or institutional investor allocating to bitcoin, you have the opportunity to discuss inflation and how bitcoin might be a way to help offset the effects on their expenses. This is the chance to address the real expense needs your clients might face, with a great example of how to solve those needs. You get to educate, and then shine.  Crypto as an investment and medium of exchange  We are used to breaking out client finances into investments and cash. At any time, if the client needs to pay for something, they can use some cash from their bank or cash account, or they have to sell some invested part of their portfolio and wait for the cash.  Crypto, on the other hand, can be used as a medium of exchange, or converted to cash or a stablecoin almost instantly for a very small fee.  For planning purposes, this means advisors and clients will be able to look at investments in digital assets as spendable. Imagine being able to pay for coffee or a car with Apple stock or an international ETF.  Moving forward  Crypto is a new asset class we haven’t seen before. It brings with it all new technologies, risks and opportunities. Your clients who want to participate still expect their advisor to be able to help keep their funds safe and explain how this investment fits their portfolio and their financial lives.  Educating yourself about this new technology is the key to having these conversations about the most exciting asset class we’ve seen in quite some time.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/02/crypto-for-advisors-important-conversations-to-have-about-crypto-with-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf3288624b41cf78fb7469a3823ec163ba012769-6048x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394450,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdZK7,1630585800,Big Institutions Are Eying Crypto. But Where Are the Inflows?,"In a June 2020 survey by Fidelity Digital, more than one-third of institutional investors in Europe and the U.S. reported holding digital assets. But traditional financial behemoths don’t exactly seem to be stampeding into the cryptocurrency space – so what gives? Will institutions’ slow entry into digital assets mean that advisors will have to wait longer to access this asset class?  Many of the largest institutional holders of cryptocurrency come from outside of the traditional financial world. Two corporations, MicroStrategy and Tesla, boast enormous crypto holdings. As of June 21, MicroStrategy had over 105,085 bitcoins, which at the time were valued at $2.7 billion, while Tesla’s second quarter bitcoin holdings were reported at over $1.3 billion. Former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Holdings owns over $500 million worth of bitcoin alone, while crypto brokerage Voyager Digital has nearly $400 million in bitcoin itself.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here.  Other major non-traditional buyers include Square, the Jack Dorsey-led commercial payments platform; Marathon Digital Holdings, a bitcoin miner; and crypto exchange Coinbase.  But traditional institutions may not be far from diving into the digital assets space, said John Sarson, a founder of crypto asset manager Sarson Funds. They’re attracted to cryptocurrencies for their promise as a hedging and diversification strategy, their potential for use in market-neutral strategies and as an alternative investment strategy.  “It looks to me like there’s going to be an institutional stampede into the cryptocurrency space,” Sarson said. “Once they start going, they don’t stop. I haven’t heard of any institutions that bought into cryptocurrency on the way up that are selling, because nothing has happened to make them want to sell.”  What could institutional adoption mean?  Large financial institutions entering into the cryptocurrency space en masse could lead to thousands of more investors and billions of additional dollars following. This would have a long-term positive impact on the underlying value of those assets.  That’s because a cryptocurrency’s value comes from the size of the underlying network supporting it, not from the independent price action of its tokens in the marketplace, said Sarson Funds co-founder Jahon Jamali. A token like bitcoin or ether becomes more valuable with each node, or junction of connections, or participant because it signifies the continued growth of a network.  A good example is the internet. In its early stages, linked computers and dial-up connections could share information via a shared protocol, but the low numbers of participants meant the value of having a computer with a modem was relatively low for most users.  In my first encounters with the internet, in elementary school in the mid-80s, the only place we could reach with our 300bps dial-up modem was NASA. A few years later, companies like America Online, Prodigy and Compuserve were bringing millions of Americans online, and the value of being able to dial into another computer grew exponentially.  Jamali said that it will be much the same with cryptocurrency.  “They [cryptocurrencies] aren’t a stock,” he said. “What we’re witnessing is more like the growth of the internet, or the expansion of telecommunications.”  Still, much media attention is spent on price action. In April, Bitcoin achieved an all-time high price at nearly $65,000 before tumbling by more than 50% in subsequent months amid a Chinese crackdown on crypto mining, trading and banking, and increased scrutiny by regulators, elected officials and the media around bitcoin’s environmental impacts, volatility and security.  But a run-up in the value of tokens like bitcoin could create thousands of clients newly eligible for an advisor’s services. These clients will need help managing and diversifying their growing holdings and muting the potential tax impacts of greatly appreciated assets.  But where are the institutions?  Even with lower bitcoin prices, however, institutions haven’t been in a rush to invest. A June 30 story by CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma noted stagnation in the balance of bitcoins held on certain exchanges and a decline in the number of bitcoin “whale” accounts, or those with more than 1,000 BTC.  That’s partially because institutions are moving slowly into the crypto space, if at all, said Sarson.  “I called an Australian pension fund with $200 billion in holdings because they wanted to know more about cryptocurrency, and I asked what their timeline was like,” said Sarson. “They were like ‘Well, we’ll do research into that asset category and whether or not we want to invest this quarter, or maybe into the summer. Then we’ll do a presentation to our board, and then we’ll decide whether to invest. If we do decide to invest, we’ll study if we want to do it ourselves or hire managers, which takes a quarter. Then we’ll conduct another study to evaluate managers.’ It will be at least two years before they invest – but at least the ball is rolling.”  Sarson pointed out that State Street’s creation of a 450-person-strong digital assets unit shows that even institutional behemoths – notoriously slow for implementing new assets, techniques and technology – are starting to take the crypto space seriously.  BNY Mellon also recently revealed plans to potentially enter the crypto custody business via a partnership with Grayscale. (Disclosure: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  “What I’m hearing from our clients is that they’re all trying to understand this [space] and learn and figure out how they want to be a part of it,” said Ram Nagappan, chief information officer at BNY Mellon Pershing. “On our side, we’re trying to get the infrastructure and chassis to handle these assets in place.”  “This is not going to go away,” he continued. “When you have so many institutions, regulators and laws coming to bear, it can’t just go away; it will just be reshaped into a more acceptable format for all of the folks still on the sidelines.”  Other methods, other influencers  There are also new methods coming to market for advisors to access crypto – most notably, ProFunds’ recent launch of a bitcoin mutual fund that will invest in futures contracts instead of in the token itself. These innovations will allow more Western institutions to hold cryptocurrencies through channels familiar and comfortable to them.  While a U.S.-domiciled crypto and bitcoin ETF still awaits a nod from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, institutional investors can also now access the space via Canadian and European exchange-traded products.  Even Capital Group, a conservative asset management stalwart, is getting into cryptocurrency, by acquiring a large position in MicroStrategy, a firm whose stock is now widely viewed as an analog for bitcoin itself, Sarson noted. At the beginning of the year, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor announced plans to invest his company’s cash reserves in bitcoin. Today, MicroStrategy holds more than $3 billion worth of bitcoin.  And as firms like Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and BlackRock have announced or expanded their digital asset efforts in recent months, this growth in institutional interest makes it likelier that a round of big institutional money will be entering the cryptocurrency space in the months to come. Each of these new participants will be designing products and exchanges that will bring new investors, and, at last, a greater community of financial advisors and their clients into cryptocurrencies.  “There really hasn’t been broad-scale adoption yet where everyone is going all-in to cryptocurrencies,” said Lisa Burns, head of platform technology at Fidelity Institutional. “More and more, though, we’re seeing an accelerating increase in interest, and thus as a company, we’re investing very heavily into it.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/02/crypto-for-advisors-big-institutions-are-eying-crypto-but-where-are-the-inflows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0212b374bfe025514bbc30ba759523e5bc997452-4288x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After that we started getting a lot of messages from our readers asking us to check this company and their 3% daily profit. Today we are going to tell you whether the Flirt Invest is another scam project or a reasonable investment. 1) Registration The company claims that it has been officially registered under the following number: 13326826. This information is easy to fact-check. The registration chamber of England provides publicly available information about all companies. You can go to the website of the registration chamber https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/ and search for a company with this number or name. As you&apos;ll see, FLIRT INVEST GROUP LTD is registered under this exact number. Registration address matches the address on the company&apos;s website. Also at the Filling History tab we can check that they really have a capital statement for 1 million pounds. Judging only from this fact we can see that the company is not a scam, but we went on for further research. Not a single scam project will contribute the authorized capital, especially in this amount. 2) Address We decided to go to the business center, where the company is located, and investigate their office. The office is located almost in the center of London, and we can assume that the cost of real estate or even rent is extremely high.

With nearly $2 billion in total value locked, the DeFi protocol is getting noticed by many people. Algorithmic liquidity will play a crucial role in the future development of decentralized finance solutions and products. What Is BENQI Exactly? As a company founded by individuals involved in Ethereum and its DeFi ecosystem, BENQI&apos;s team acknowledged the potential of blockchain and crypto assets early on. Although Ethereum&apos;s blockchain has technical limitations leading to scaling concerns and high transaction fees, Avalanche provided a solution. The blockchain has a different consensus algorithm, warranting a closer look. For BENQI&apos;s team, Avalanche could help offset some of the load from Ethereum and provide a better transaction experience for users. Even though the Avalanche ecosystem is still in the very early stages, several DeFi protocols leverage its technology. As Ethereum congestion remains a pressing issue for many - as is the centralized nature of Binance Smart Chain - Avalanche can give BENQI a first-mover advantage. Bringing lending and borrowing services to this ecosystem combined with algorithmic liquidity market solutions puts a very different spotlight on this blockchain ecosystem.

42413864,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZXK0I,1630583749,Ether’s Options Market Sees Highest Trading Volume Since May,"Ether’s options market has come alive with the cryptocurrency resuming the uptrend from July lows.  Major exchanges traded 172,472 ether (ETH) options contracts on Wednesday, the highest single-day figure since May 20, according to data tracked by Glassnode. Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange, alone accounted for 172,000 contracts, while OKEx contributed the rest.  Including over-the-counter trading, daily volume tallied more than $630 million in nominal terms, also the highest in over three months. Over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm accounted for 40% of the global volume, Paradigm’s co-founder, Anand Gomes, told CoinDesk. Trades facilitated by Paradigm are automatically executed, margined and cleared at Deribit.  “Our highest market share for ETH has been 45%, so yesterday was one of our highest days,” Gomes said in a Telegram chat. Deribit and Paradigm introduced an institution-focused block-trading service two years ago.  Ether’s rally to 3.5-month highs above $3,800 has boosted options market activity, most of which has been concentrated in the higher strike or out-of-the-money calls or bullish bets.  Deribit data tracked by Laevitas shows Sept. 24 expiry calls at $6,000 and $7,000 registered trading volumes of more than 13,000 contracts as sophisticated traders set up “call spread” strategies at these strikes via Paradigm.  Call spread strategies involve buying/selling calls at a particular strike ($6,000 in this case) and simultaneously taking an opposite position in the higher strike call ($7,000). Paradigm, however, doesn’t reveal the nature of the flows, and so it’s not clear whether traders initiated the limited risk, limited reward bull call spreads by purchasing $6,000 calls and selling an equal number of $7,000 calls or did the reverse to set up a bear call spread.  That said, the way the options are priced suggests bullishness in the market. Data provided by derivatives analytics firm Skew shows the one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the value of puts relative to calls, continue to trade negative, indicating greater demand for calls than puts or bearish bets.  Ether is currently trading near $3,750 on major exchanges.

The country’s Financial Crime Investigation Unit (FCIU) confirmed receiving documents requesting an investigation into multiple transactions, which included cash and property worth over $10 billion, Seychelles News Agency reported Monday.  Tania Potter, head of legal affairs for the FCIU, said that the unit had “received quite a number of documents, as part of the complaint, some of which need to undergo a verification process to identify any links to the Seychelles and upon completion, a decision on the next step will be taken.”  The lawyer lodging the complaint, Jonathan Levy, said that the “the misuse of the Seychelles jurisdiction and involvement of public officials to commit the crypto crime of the century calls into question the use of the Seychelles by other crypto ventures.”  “If Seychelles lacks the ability to regulate crypto asset transactions worth billions, then there are serious anti-money laundering issues raised about cryptocurrency companies that choose to base their operations there,” he said.  The alleged OneCoin Ponzi scheme is said to have defrauded around $4 billion from millions of investors.  Investors were told OneCoin could be mined and had actual value, though it did not in fact exist on a blockchain and its perceived value was manipulated by automatic generation of new coins.

42413854,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZXJhm,1630562070,Singapore Issues Investor Alert for Binance,"The Monetary Authority of Singapore issued an investor alert for Binance’s global website, according to the central bank and regulator’s site.  The list includes entities that are unregulated by the MAS but that may be erroneously perceived as licensed or regulated, the agency said.  The MAS subsequently said Binance may have breached Singapore’s Payment Services Act by providing payment services to and soliciting business from residents of Singapore, Bloomberg reported. The authority ordered Binance to stop such activities immediately, according to the report.  In early July, MAS said that it would “follow up” with Binance’s Singapore entity, which at the time was waiting for the review of its license application.  In an emailed statement to CoinDesk on Thursday, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, said it is aware of the notice and is “actively working” with the MAS to address the watchdog’s concerns.  In late August, Binance hired Richard Teng, the former CEO of Abu Dhabi’s financial watchdog, to head its Singapore operations, possibly to curb the regulatory tide against it.  Binance has been in regulators’ crosshairs all around the world in recent months, including in Japan and the U.K.  Singapore’s 2019 Payment Services Act requires crypto companies to be licensed to operate in the city-state.  The law has been perceived as largely positive toward the industry, because it creates a comprehensive legal framework under which crypto companies can operate. Hundreds of companies have applied for the licenses, and the MAS has started granting the coveted certifications.  On Wednesday, the MAS issued a digital token payments license to local fintech firm FOMO Pay.

The gambling regulator said in a blog post on Thursday that while the technology presents “unprecedented” opportunities, challenges relating to government regulation and issues of national sovereignty are also present.  The National Betting Authority is exploring whether blockchain technology can support and enhance its supervision of Cyprus’ gambling industry.  A presentation by the University of Nicosia is expected to touch on blockchain and cryptocurrency use in the industry with a panel discussion to follow on the benefits the technology brings to the public and private sectors.  Meanwhile, Christiana Aristidou, a technology lawyer and president of the Technology Committee of the Cyprus Bar Association, is expected to moderate the discussion, which is scheduled to take place next Wednesday.  In 2013, Nicosia became the world’s first accredited university to accept bitcoin from students as a form of payment for tuition and fees.

The bank said Thursday the goal of “Project Dunbar” is to develop prototype platforms that can support international settlements with digital currencies issued by multiple central banks. According to the statement, the project will focus on developing these prototypes on different distributed ledger technology platforms and experiment with various governance and operating designs that could help central banks to share CBDC infrastructures.  “These multi-CBDC platforms will allow financial institutions to transact directly with each other in the digital currencies issued by participating central banks, eliminating the need for intermediaries and cutting the time and cost of transactions,” the announcement said.  Despite taking a cautionary stance on CBDCs back in 2019, BIS changed gears and announced it was planning its own digital currency trials the very next year. In its annual economic reporthttps://www.bis.org/a/arpdf/ar2021e3.htm for 2021, BIS highlighted that CBDCs could improve cross-border payments. The report also said that while multi-CBDC solutions could ease sharing of required information (like digital IDs) across borders, it will require international cooperation.  The bank announced its Innovation Hub initiative to build testing platforms for multiple digital currencies back in January. Three centers of the Innovation Hub in Singapore, Hong Kong and Switzerland are all working on multi-CBDC settlements, while Project Dunbar is led by the Singapore Centre.
