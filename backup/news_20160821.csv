42427020,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJybDh,1471787432,Bitcoin and the Law of Conservation of Energy,"Alex Millar is a blogger, podcaster and YouTube publisher, with a degree in Engineering Physics from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.  In this opinion piece, Millar expounds his theory that money is energy, arguing that bitcoin provides a superior alternative to fiat currencies from a purely scientific perspective.  In physics, the definition of ""energy"" is ""that which allows work to be done.""  This means that money is energy, since it can be used to do work via payments to people. The energy in money can be thought of as ""economic energy"". Economists call economic energy ""price"" and measure it in terms of ""euros"" or ""Kenyan shillings"" and so on.  But, these units are abstract because their quantity changes over time. Physicists would prefer to use units such as joules or kilowatt-hours, which have a concrete basis in physical realities of mass (kg), length (m), and time (s).  Since money is energy we can apply the Law of Conservation of Energy, which says: ""Energy cannot be created or destroyed, merely transformed.”  You might remember examples of this law from high school science: a toaster transforms electrical energy into thermal energy; a blender transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy.  A $100 bill has significant economic energy. And yet, it was created in an automated process using inexpensive raw materials and an insignificant amount of electrical energy. This invites the question: from where did the economic energy in a $100 bill come from?  The answer lies in economics 101, which says that price (economic energy) is a function of supply and demand.  As the overall supply of a commodity increases, the energy of each unit decreases. Therefore, the energy contained in a new $100 bill was transformed from pre-existing dollars, each of which lost a tiny fraction of its energy. Power is a zero-sum game.  This realization has ramifications for traditional monies such as dollars, proof-of-stake (PoS) monies such as those planned for future versions of ethereum, and proof-of-work (PoW) monies such as bitcoin.  Dollars, euros, etc  As explained above, when authorities create new dollars, they take energy from holders of pre-existing dollars.  The energy equation is simple:  Let’s assume a future ethereum is a PoS network that awards new coins to ether holders in proportion to their holdings.  In other words, everyone holding X coins will have Cx coins after the next coin reward, (where C is some constant). Energy is transformed from old coins to new coins, which are held by the same people.  Without a flow of energy it is difficult to see the point of creating new coins in a PoS system. Supposedly the purpose is to find consensus on the growth of a blockchain. This remains to be seen.  Proof-of-work coins  The creation process of PoW coins (like bitcoin) consumes large amounts of electrical energy.  Bitcoin fans might be tempted to assume that this energy is completely transformed into economic energy of new coins and that, therefore, pre-existing coins do not lose energy.  However, the mining process also creates heat. If the energy in the heat is equal to the electrical energy consumed, then the energy in new coins must come from pre-existing coins. Fortunately, this seems unlikely, since machines tend not to be used if energy input is completely lost to heat.    It seems much more likely that economic energy is transformed from electrical energy with some efficiency loss to heat.  Summary  Whereas those who store energy in dollars have energy syphoned by economic parasites, those who store energy in bitcoin do not.  Bitcoin miners have found a way to convert electrical energy into economic energy.  As logical people realize that they can store pure economic energy without the drawback of hosting an economic parasite, they will sell their dollars for bitcoin. This will result in a conversion of energy from dollars to bitcoin.  It will also create a positive feedback loop: even people who cannot see the logic of holding a parasite-resistant money will see the economic energy (price) of bitcoin rise due to rising demand.  Later, as the total economic energy in bitcoin approaches that of dollars, people will notice the economic energy of dollars fall due to falling demand. Like a chemical reaction, energy will then transform quickly, and nearly completely (I say ""nearly completely"" because some people will refuse to stop believing in dollars).  Finally, from a physicist’s perspective, there is an inevitable trend in the universe for entropy (disorder) to increase.  Since PoW coins like bitcoin are the only money that contributes to increasing entropy through heat loss in mining, they are the only money that has a purpose from a universal perspective.

42427005,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyanh,1471779756,Can Two Ethereum Markets Co-Exist?,"How big is the ethereum market? In light of recent developments, answering this question has become more complex for traders and market observers.  Due to the unintended consequences of the ethereum community's decision to create a new version of its blockchain last month, there are now two ethereum markets representing the value of almost identical platforms.  The planned technical change, which at first had seemed to go off without a hitch, soon got a little strange, as a whole ecosystem of exchanges, miners and traders sprung up around the abandoned blockchain.  At press time, this has resulted in a market for tokens trading on two separate blockchains. Ethereum, the blockchain created in the hard fork, had a total market cap of nearly $900m, while ethereum classic's market cap stood at $141m. Ethereum tokens (ethers/ETH) were worth just over $10, while classic ethers (ETC) were valued at $1.70.  For some time, the fork created a field day for traders.  Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, recalled the sudden rise, telling CoinDesk:  ""It initially looked like ETC was going to experience a quick death as it was worth nearly nothing and the vast majority of miners were supporting ETH.""  After the hard fork was executed, he said, ""big players"" in the digital currency trading space starting buying ""large amounts"" of ETC. Further, as those who owned ETH were automatically credited an equal amount of ETC, trading volume surged as speculators sought gains.  ""The markets weren’t very liquid, and so even a small boost in demand was able to boost the price,"" he added. ""Price appreciation drove interest.""  However, now that the dust has settled, market observers are beginning to wonder how long ETC and ETH will be able to coexist. Will the ethereum blockchain be abandoned by developers? Will the new chain be embraced? Or will both stubbornly continue to coexist?  For now, it seems, experts aren't really sure.  Ideology drives fundamentals  While the two blockchains are near identical, some market observers believe the ideological differences create separate price dynamics.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, spoke to how desires for ideological purity helped fuel the creation of ethereum classic.  His argument is that by rejecting the decision to return funds stolen by the so-called DAO hacker, ETC established itself as a blockchain that would preserve the finality of transactions.  ""The rise of ETC is a direct testament to the power of a decentralized, non-governed blockchain system, despite its flaws, and a clear rejection of ETH, which is now regarded by some as a centralized, influenceable system governed by a few enlightened developers,"" he said.  As traders were drawn to this idea, so were other key blockchain players.  Following the hard fork, as trading volume grew, miners saw value in mining the old version of the blockchain.  Demand questioned  Now that ETH and ETC coexist, the more important question is whether this situation is sustainable. Do both markets exhibit the needed fundamentals?  Zivkovski emphasized that the volatility on ""ETH-based pairs"" remains high, as the ETH currency is just over a year old.  Demand, he said, will be required to keep up this volatility.  ""The question that's on every market observer's mind is whether this demand can be sustained,"" he noted, adding:  ""ETH (and ETC) volumes in the recent past have been overwhelmingly speculative, and we all know that speculative demand comes to pass.""  Zivkovski asserted that both currencies have yet to define themselves as uniquely as bitcoin, arguing they have limited use as a store of value.  Past that, Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, emphasized that both markets may be sustained as they have proved profitable for traders.  ""Holders of ETH pre-fork have actually increased their wealth since the fork [when you combine] the ETH and ETC prices,"" he said.  Technical concerns  Still, some market observers point to the potential technical limitations of having twin platforms.  After all, the tokens are meant to power decentralized ethereum applications, and it's not immediately clear what having two versions of ether provides developers.  Calibrated Markets LLC's Jacob Eliosoff has argued that having two markets simply isn't practical for end-users.  ""'The more the merrier' is a fine philosophy for ideologues and traders, but for people who actually want to run or build smart contracts, two chains are a mess,” he said.  He also wondered whether the two blockchains will be able to draw enough developer talent to continue.  Here, Burniske said, he sees ETC at a disadvantage.  ""While developer support is growing for ETC, I don’t see a cohesive team of rock-star developers moving to support it, in the way that we’ve seen with ETH,"" he said.  Burniske noted that, while he doesn’t necessarily think ETC will ever ""die"", he said digital currencies often fade into obsolescence. After all, to remain ""alive"", the network only requires one mining rig.  Hayes provided the most optimistic view, however, stating that, through clear ideological differences, the two versions of ethereum could continue.  He concluded:  ""Both coins can co-exist because they serve different purposes and stakeholders.""
