42399387,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj242,1475698709,Demand for Zcash Mining Grows as Blockchain Launch Approaches,"With less than a month to go before its launch, momentum is continuing to build around Zcash.  The much anticipated anonymous cryptocurrency project gained a big ally today in hosted mining company, Genesis Mining, which announced that users would soon be able to mine for the digital currency. With the news, customers can now buy miners operated by Genesis, which offers similar services for bitcoin and ethereum.  But while the genesis block for the Zcash blockchain won't launch until 28th October, the product offering can be seen as evidence that interest in the technology, first announced in 2014, is continuing to grow.  Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, explained that his interest lies in how the Zcash could complement other blockchain projects. For a cryptocurrency to be viable, he argued, it needs to be fungible (ie one bitcoin has to be indistinguishable from any other) and if there is no privacy, there is no fungibility.  Zcash attempts to solve this problem, as despite what some believe, public blockchains like bitcoin are surprisingly not that anonymous. By simply auditing the blockchain, users can gain insight into whether their coins were ever used for illegal activities, such as on Silk Road.  By using what's known as a zero-knowledge proof construction, a cryptographic proof that allows the sender to prove to the receiver that value has been transferred without sharing any data or interacting, the ledger is able to secure all balances without identities and amounts being shared. Only those that have the correct key can see the actual value of the transaction.  Those interested in mining Zcash should note that the reward follows a similar path to bitcoin's, though with a twist planned around the time of its launch. During the first 34 days, the block reward will gradually increase from 0 ZEC to 12.5 ZEC.  Further, unlike many other altcoins that followed bitcoin's use of the SHA256 algorithm for proof-of-work, Zcash (ZEC) relies on an algorithm called Equihash.

42399396,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj2Av,1475684242,Bitcoin Lightning Payments Pass 'Milestone' With Blockstream Test,"Progress on the bitcoin lightning network continues to advance.  Following a promising trial of its routing network last week by French startup Acinq, Montreal-based Blockstream has announced that it has sent the first end-to-end transaction over the Lightning Network, a highly-anticipated top layer for the bitcoin network designed to boost transaction capacity.  What the team called ""Lightning's first strike"" saw its developers send a transaction across a test version of the network successfully to another party, a process that included invoicing that party for bitcoin and routing the payment through multiple nodes.  Sent over the bitcoin testnet, the transaction of 0.01 test BTC was used to ""sell"" a picture of two cats sitting in front of a sunset composed of ASCII characters.  While this may seem trivial, the announcement can be seen as a sign that Lightning is progressing from the concept stage toward implementation. To date, most of the implementations have focused on high-level items like routing and privacy, rather than offering an example of how Lightning might enhance bitcoin at scale.  Blockstream core tech engineer Rusty Russell told CoinDesk:  ""We had all these pieces. That's really exciting as a geek. In some ways, attaching them all together is trivial. In another way, it's a real milestone to get to that point.""  Though not the company's signature project, Blockstream has long been a contributor to the Lightning Network, as have several other startups. (There's even one VC-backed firm called Lightning, launched last year).  In particular, Russell has been working on an implementation of Lightning Network since March 2015. Likewise, Blockstream core tech engineer Christian Decker, who joined Blockstream in August, originally proposed Duplex Lightning Micropayment Channels, another way to tap micropayment channels for the same purpose: scaling bitcoin.  Inside details  But the Blockstream engineers described the end-to-end implementation as quite a different test than Acinq's. Rather than focusing on efficient routing, the engineers were testing a successful transaction across the network.  ""Their work shows how, by way of simple analogy, one can create a streetmap to get from A to B in an efficient way, while the test we've demonstrated here ... has us actually walking that path on the street,"" the blog post explains.  And the testing was conducted on the bitcoin testnet. The two developers view their move from bitcoin regtest (a way to test features on top of bitcoin) to the sometimes unpredictable testnet a big deal.  ""This is poking your nose a little further out into the real world,"" Russel said.  The engineers also noted that the transaction speed was about a few tenths of a millisecond, a time they compared to those executed on the bitcoin blockchain and its 10-minute block confirmation times. The results, they inferred, thereby show the increased user experience Lightning could bring to the network at scale.  ""It's really incredible to us,"" Decker said, adding: ""It took me longer to go back to the webpage and click on a link to get my cat, than the actual transfer.""  Future Lightning development  This promising progress could also continue in the coming weeks.  All of the implementers of different Lightning projects plan to meet in Milan, Italy, after this weekend’s big bitcoin developer conference Scaling Bitcoin to draw up new standards.  Along the lines of this goal, Decker said the plan is to ""set up a small ecosystem"" on the bitcoin testnet for micropayment channels. Blockstream further plans to release its work so that anyone can try out the technology, or so that ""you can buy your own cat on testnet,"" as Russell put it.  But while the implementation is a working end-to-end system, the engineers say there are other features they have worked on that still need to be added to this testnet version.  For example, each node in this testnet version has ""global knowledge"" of the topology of the network. So, as far as finding a path across the network, it doesn't use an efficient routing system that is able to scale to a larger number of network nodes.  Nonetheless, they were able to put the pieces together for a working testnet transaction.  ""I think it was incredibly exciting to do this,"" Russell said. ""I was surprised. Working for year on this, it’s easy to lose perspective on how exciting this stuff is. To see it come together and to see someone buy a cat is surprisingly cool.""

42399381,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj1y8,1475682019,Dubai Wants All Government Documents on Blockchain By 2020,"The Crown Prince of Dubai announced a strategic plan today that would see all government documents secured on a blockchain by 2020.  Revealed at an event hosted by the Dubai Future Foundation and the Smart Dubai Office, the final goal of the government-led initiative is to open the blockchain platform to other cities around the world.  In remarks, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum explained the effort is part of a larger bid by the emirate, one of seven in the larger UAE, to set the ""standard"" for smart cities.  He said:  ""The emirate is building on that achievement by constantly working to foresee the future and keep up with the fourth industrial revolution and all the prospects of increased efficiency that come along with it.""  According to a statement, the Dubai government estimates its blockchain strategy has the potential to generate 25.1 million hours of economic productivity each year in savings, while reducing CO2 emissions.  The initiative announced today is notably part of Dubai's year-long push to become a global leader in blockchain tech. In April of this year, for example, Dubai launched its Global Blockchain Initiative (GBI) with 30 members from both the public and private sectors, and the initiative now counts 47 government and financial entities as members.  Two groups involved in that effort, the Dubai Future Foundation and Smart Dubai Office, are slated to take leading roles in the new plan's execution.  The three pillars  According to a statement, Dubai's blockchain strategy will be built on ""three pillars"", including government efficiency, industry creation and international leadership.  The organizers expect the blockchain project will contribute to increased government efficiency by creating a new digital layer for city transactions. Further, once the documents have been moved to a blockchain, the organizers believe the project will create business opportunities for the private sector.  Industries Dubai expects to benefit from the transition include real estate, banking, healthcare, transportation, urban planning, smart energy, digital commerce, and tourism.  But perhaps the most interesting aspect of the news is the government's plan to open its platform to to other cities and nations.  Dubai Future Foundation and Smart Dubai said they believe the international network could make it easier for travelers to cross borders with certain pre-approved forms of identification and pre-authenticated digital wallets and payments.  Mohammed Abdullah Al Gergawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs and the Future said in a statement:  ""Users will only need to log in their personal data or business credentials once; it will then be updated and verified in a timely manner through the blockchain network in all government and private entities including banks [and] insurance companies.""

42399386,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj224,1475674210,No R3: Overstock Plots Blockchain Consortium For 'Everyone Else',"Online retail giant and upstart blockchain innovator Overstock has begun work on its own blockchain consortium.  To be called ""Revolution 4"", the project is envisioned as a way for the company, long one of the most bullish on blockchain, to share its technology and regulatory expertise as it relates to the emerging tech. In a new interview, Revolution 4 president John Tabacco said Overstock is seeking to launch the effort for small businesses, FinTech firms and startups, and that it is currently seeking partners.  Tabacco lauded the work R3 has done in creating a meeting place for large banks and institutions, however, he expressed a desire to extend the startup's model to participants that haven't yet been courted by the industry's dominant collaborative, or that have been priced out of the group.  Tabacco told CoinDesk:  ""There’s the large banks and the entrenched incumbents, and then there's everyone else in the world. But, if you’re going to change the paradigm and organically innovate, you have to have access to valuable resources.""  Tabacco indicated Overstock has a few potential members so far interested in the offering, but that he has company CEO Patrick Byrne's ""full blessing"" in pursuing the idea to fruition.  Notably, he suggested Overstock isn't interested in using the consortium as a way to develop technologies that would serve these members, a move that appears counter to the strategy of R3 and its work on its own distributed ledger platforms.  ""The hope is we can use this innovation marketplace as a backbone and then, we can work with members to strategically partner,"" Tabacco said. ""The idea is not to sell something back to our members, it's to make all participants' overall product offering better.""  The news follows increasing competition among blockchain consortium efforts, though to date most of these initiatives have been centered on geographic regions.  In recent months, for example, consortium efforts have sprung up in Russia and China amid a rise in enterprise interest in the emerging technology.  Overstock indicated there would be a membership fee for enrollment, but stopped short of offering any timelines for a formal launch.

42399401,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj2Ds,1475666484,How Switzerland's First Financial Markets Blockchain Was Born,"A prototype currently being developed by Swiss infrastructure provider Six Securities is just the beginning of its plan to reimagine how operations could be restructured with distributed ledgers.  Built in collaboration with Digital Asset Holdings, the prototype is designed to show how corporate actions (such as the sale of company shares or a change in leadership) could be communicated via the technology. Instead of shareholders being informed via middlemen, a single shared ledger, the firm believes, could near-instantly reflect the changes.  While an early version of the prototype was demoed at Sibos last week, the man in charge of the effort said it is part of a broader effort to investigate how blockchain could impact its role in government and corporate securities.  Six Group head of innovation management, Markus Graf, explained how distributed ledgers could come to impact what the company calls its 'Swiss Value Chain'. Yet, he also spoke about challenges, including sorting through the kinds of big ideas that can be encouraged by blockchain.  Graf told CoinDesk:  ""At the moment, we have about 17 different ideas [for] how we could bring certain parts of our four market divisions on a blockchain.""  But before the efficiencies of a shared distributed ledger can be built into the Six Securities Swiss Exchange, its securities services, its financial information provider and its payments services provider, Graf said he and his team need to make sure all the possible applications are interoperable.  Sorting through the soup  Six Securities said it has been working with blockchain since last summer when it hired an outside consultant to train its innovation team.  Divided into two groups, half the team (the same group that heads its virtual reality and AI projects) works with each of the company's four market divisions to identify new blockchain products for their customers. The F10 Incubator, on the other hand, is focused externally and focusing on helping finance entrepreneurs incorporate and identify markets.  Graf describes the resulting atmosphere as one where blockchain ideas ""pop up"" on a regular basis, but that was initially disorganized due to the organic nature of the work.  ""In the end you have this soup of different blockchains which doesn’t really help,"" he said. “Essentially, it doesn’t need to be one blockchain, but at least they should be able to talk to each other.""  To begin to make sense of all its ideas, Six Securities began work on a private blockchain called Sixchain. The initial effort combined financial information on a blockchain with an exchange-traded derivatives product.  ""It worked, it was fantastic, everyone was clapping,"" said Graf. ""It was an aperitif, everyone said it was fantastic. Then someone said, 'What's the value proposition for the customer of Six?' It was a bit like, 'Hmmm, good question.'""  The answer, it turns out, became apparent during interviews with various stakeholders in response to the proof of concept itself: corporate actions.  ""We just realized [putting corporate actions on a blockchain] would be easier,"" said Graf. ""But also, when we spoke to customers of Six, especially banks, there would be need for a new kind of product in these areas.""  It so happened that right around the corner from Graf's office, a startup on the verge of being acquired by New York-based Digital Asset Holdings had begun work to help his company.  Founded in 2015, Zurich-based smart contract startup Elevance was already engaged in conversations with Six Securities when it was purchased in April for an undisclosed amount. (As the deal was closing, Six Securities sent a request-for-proposal, to which Elevance and Digital Asset jointly responded).  As part of the deal, much of the Elevance team stayed on to help run DAH’s Zurich offices, and its work with Six Securities continued unabated.  In addition to DAH building a prototype for Six Securities with their own technology, the distributed ledger startup that has raised more than $60m in venture capital is helping its partner lay out a roadmap for how blockchain or another distributed ledger can help Six save its customers money.  Graf concluded:  ""This is the main part of the work Digital Asset Holdings is doing with us. Basically, with our architecture and my engineers from our innovation lab, to try to figure out how we will do that in the future.""

42399376,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj1vB,1475629566,Tim Draper Leads $4.2 Million Series A for Blockchain Startup Factom,"Blockchain startup Factom has raised $4.2m in new funding to build a series of unnamed new products for its blockchain data network.  The Austin, Texas-based company that lets users verify data using its Factom blockchain, fresh off winning a $200,000 grant from the US Department of Homeland Securities, now plans to scale with a series of hires to be announced over the coming months.  Factom co-founder and CEO Peter Kirby said the Series A round, led by venture capitalist Tim Draper, will also be used to further develop its core technology and suite of products.  Kirby told CoinDesk:  ""We really believe that when you move all the data in the world into the blockchain you can create a lot of transparency and value.""    Factom had previously raised over $3m, and already has three enterprise products: a data protection tool, an identity solution and distributed data storage service similar to a more traditional database.    In total, Factom's protocol is being used to secure 67.4 million records, according to its official website.  Behind the investment  Investment news site Frisco Fastball picked up the Series A filing with the SEC and provided insight into the round, ultimately concluding that the funding could represent confidence in the company given that it sold 100% of its offering.  ""On average, companies in the not disclosed sector, sell 67.77% of the total offering size. Factom sold 100.00% of the offering,"" the news source wrote.  The comments may be a surprise given that the startup has long been one of the more contentious in the industry. In addition to questions about its use of a publicly traded digital asset to fund its operations, Factom has also seen potentially key partnerships fail to materialize.  Still, investor Tim Draper lauded the firm in statements to CoinDesk, focusing on how he believes the platform can mitigate issues common to centralized data storing services.  Draper said:  ""Centralized data is prone to critical failure by any individual mistake, whether by user error or malicious hacking. By decentralizing data through the blockchain, Factom avoids critical failures due to user error or hacker.""
