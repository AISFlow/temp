42399180,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZsg,1469655646,Bitcoin Price Impact Debated Ahead of Possible Japan Stimulus,"The price of bitcoin has benefited from macroeconomic uncertainty this year, rising more than 50% over the last six months as China devalued the yuan and the UK dramatically exited the European Union.  As the calendar rolls ahead to August, and excitement over these price drivers fades, market observers are beginning to wonder if further global events will benefit the digital currency's markets in 2016.  Against this backdrop, a Bank of Japan (BOJ) meeting approaching later this week has many digital currency market observers wondering how any new easing announced by the central bank could come to impact the price of bitcoin.  If the central bank uses additional stimulus, this move could place downward pressure on the yen's buying power, motivating market participants to flee the currency and purchase safe haven assets like bitcoin instead. Of course, the perception that this event could occur may be just as powerful given that the bitcoin price is often driven by speculation, in both senses of the word.  A majority of economists participating in a recent Reuters poll – as well as the most respondents in a survey conducted by Citi – indicated their expectation is that further easing will come from the BOJ's meeting, to be held on 28th and 29th July.  CoinDesk received similar responses when speaking with economists.  For example Usha Haley, professor of International Business at West Virginia University, stated that the market is still expecting ""some form of easing"" at the BOJ’s policy meeting next week, even if the extent of this stimulus is not clear.  Fiscal policy  Regardless of what methods of easing the central bank decides to use, more than one market expert emphasized the key importance of fiscal policy.  ""Market expectations are such that the BOJ has to do something 'big' or they will risk disappointing the market,” said Jack McIntyre, CFA and portfolio manager for Brandywine Global Investment Management.  He said that he believes more than $10tn ($94bn) must be injected into the markets in order for the actions to be viewed ""positively"".  ""That fiscal stimulus cannot be smoke and mirrors – it needs to go to actual increases in government spending,"" he emphasized.  Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, also stressed the importance of ""aggressive fiscal policy,"" noting that it is one of the few remaining options left for spurring growth since Japan’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing have been ineffective.  Should the Japanese government decide to implement aggressive fiscal policy, this approach could increase the money supply and potentially spur inflation by lessening the yen’s buying power.  Expert predictions  While market observers seem to have high hopes for the Japanese government stimulus, they are divided in terms of how these initiatives will affect the yen.  Burniske spoke to this situation, emphasizing how the goal of ""aggressive monetary and fiscal policy"" is spurring growth, and along with it, inflation.  He said:  ""Of course, inflationary fiat makes the long-term deflationary structure of bitcoin all the more appealing.""  Greater BOJ stimulus might push the yen lower, Samuel Rines, senior economist and portfolio strategist for independent registered investment advisor Avalon Advisors LLC, told CoinDesk.  However, he suggested that markets have already begun to move to offset or capitalize on this action, meaning any impact from the announcement, including any benefit to bitcoin, could be limited.  ""Markets have begun to price in some of the stimulus. So the amount of reaction there may be minute,"" he said.  While the aforementioned market observers spoke to potential yen weakness on the horizon, Oana Aristide, senior economist at Dun & Bradstreet UK, spoke to the currency’s strength.  ""On the yen, our view is that most influences point to strength rather than weakness,” she said. ""There is more monetary easing coming in Japan, as well as a substantial fiscal stimulus package, but none of these are novel for 'Abenomics'; it is worth noting that the BOJ's latest major move (switching to negative interest rates) actually resulted in a slightly stronger yen.""  Finally, Aristide added that since Japanese officials have ruled out so-called helicopter money, her firm expects the yen to continue to experience volatility, but maintain a ""strengthening bias"" when compared to other major currencies.  Bitcoin impact  Digital currency market experts seemed, on the whole, a bit more reserved in terms of how they believed such actions would affect the bitcoin market.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, described further easing as ""bullish"" for bitcoin, although he asserted that ""the BOJ’s actions are not catalytic enough to spark any significant change in trading activity in Japan"".  McIntyre cast doubts on the idea that further BOJ easing would spur investors to flock to bitcoin.  ""I don’t believe that a weak yen by itself drives the Japanese to shift money into bitcoin,” he said, adding:  ""The more likely scenario would be a flight to safety that drives Japanese money offshore. Expect to see the Japanese retail investor chase yield in places like Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and New Zealand.""  Currently, Japan is in a ""dangerous situation"" characterized by negative interest rates and balance sheets laden with cash that is not going to use, Burniske emphasized.  As the nation's officials make an effort to remedy Japan’s economic malaise, we will simply have to wait and see how effective they are.  The policy of other central banks – for example the Federal Reserve – will also play a key role in determining how strong the Japanese yen is relative to other currencies.  Should the Asian nation require significant stimulus going forward, such developments could help drive continued weakening of the Japanese yen, spurring market participants to flee the currency, and potentially, consider alternative assets instead.

42399179,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZtf,1469651477,Financial Stability Board Still Weighing Digital Currency Risks,"The Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body composed of central bank officials and finance regulators, said in its latest annual report that it continues to assess opportunities and risks related to digital currencies.  The report  , published earlier this week, indicated that the FSB’s work is largely in line with previous statements from the organization. In March, the group said that it was actively discussing the technology and its impact on the financial system.  The report states:  ""The FSB's continued work in this area will consider both the risks and opportunities presented by the developments in financial technology, the issues raised for public authorities by these technologies, possible steps to address potential risks, and opportunities for cooperation in the FSB and with the standard-setting bodies to deepen analysis and develop regulatory perspectives.""  The FSB disclosed its work in the area earlier this year, when Reserve Bank of India deputy governor Subhash Sheoratan Mundra offered details during a speech given in February.  Currently chairng the FSB is Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and former governor of the Bank of Canada. Carney recently detailed the central bank's work on blockchain technology in statements released earlier this month.  The FSB was formed in 2009 by the international organization G-20 in the wake of the financial crisis.

42399166,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZhr,1469647954,ItBit Hit With String of Departures in Bitcoin-to-Blockchain Transition,"A series of recent departures at itBit have left the company looking much different than it did just a few months ago.  Following the release of itBit's enterprise clearing and settlement network Bankchain last year, three directors (and at least three other employees) have gone on to other endeavors. The exits appear to come amid a larger company transformation from bitcoin-only exchange to enterprise blockchain service provider.  Multiple former employees have confirmed with CoinDesk that at least seven itBit employees have transitioned to other companies in that time. Only six have updated their LinkedIn, while the seventh one has not replied to requests for comment. ItBit has also declined to comment.  Two of the three departing directors have moved onto investment companies in the digital currency space, with the third launching a recruiting firm.  After departing itBit earlier this month, the company's former director of institutional clients, Daniel Kim, took a position at Gemini Exchange. Also this month, itBit’s former global director of talent, Leanne Wong, departed the company and is now listed as a founding partner of MC Partners, a New York-based recruiting firm, on LinkedIn.  Further, former itBit director Bobby Cho departed the company in April and now works at DRW Capital, a subsidiary of Cumberland Mining Materials, the stealth startup that last year won 27,000 bitcoins from a US Marshals auction of Silk Road funds.  Another notable departure is itBit's former blockchain software engineer Michael Wozniak, who appears to have left blockchain altogether for a job at instant messaging service Snapchat.  New direction?  While the departure of so many top-level employees in such a short period of time would be notable in any startup, there is reason to believe the moves coincide with a bigger-picture transformaiton at the company.  ItBit is currently seeking to fill eight vacancies, several of which, including its blockchain engineer and senior recruiter roles, appear to be replacements for the recent departures. But other hires focused on precious metals clearing and settlement indicate a new focus on Bankchain.  The recent spat of departures could be linked to plans itBit might have for its trading platform.  Sources told CoinDesk itBit may be considering closing or selling its exchange as early as September, with Kraken listed as possibly interested. The company could be considering a rebrand as Paxos, a name that comes from a group of consensus protocols.  The decisions certainly wouldn't be surprising given the state of the industry.  For the past year and a half, digital currency firms have been faced with questions of how to respond to the rising interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology, an uptick that has coincided with declining consumer demand.

42399185,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZvd,1469631629,Blockstream Buys Bitcoin Wallet to Boost Sidechains Development,"Bitcoin infrastructure architect Blockstream has acquired wallet provider GreenAddress in a move the startup says could impact the development of its signature, still in-development sidechains solution.  Following the acquisition, GreenAddress Wallet's team of three developers will continue to work on privacy and security bolstering features for the wallet as well as compatibility for sidechains, a bitcoin infrastructure component that Blockstream has raised $76m in two investment rounds to engineer.  In interview, former GreenAddress founder and CEO Lawrence Nahum, now senior architect at Blockstream, said that the goal is to shape the wallet into a something like a portal for sidechains, a technology meant to enable a new wave of interoperable blockchains that could be anchored to the bitcoin blockchain.  Nahum told CoinDesk:  ""Blockstream is not just going to need some node service that provides some functionality, but it's also going to need an interface, a wallet. It will provide an integrated solution for Blockstream customers.""  The move is perhaps not surprising, as the two teams have been working closely for two years.  Launched in 2014, GreenAddress Wallet was early to support innovative wallet features, such as deterministic wallets that allow for improved key creation and multi-signature security.  Sidechains compatibility  But, more than absorbing GreenAddress, the two companies plan to merge their technologies.  Nahum explained that GreenAddress already supports Blockstream’s sidechains alpha functionality, which doesn't appear to be publicly supported by other wallets, and the plan is to further integrate the two.  One way for the wallet to integrate the technology is by supporting Sidechain Elements, the open-source tool that allows developers to mix and match features, such as Segregated Witness or new scripting opcodes expanding bitcoin’s functionality, to create customizable sidechains.  ""Schnorr transactions and confidential transactions, these are all things we’re providing support for,"" Nahum said.  Current sidechains in-progress include the alpha testnet and the first commercial sidechain, Liquid, geared toward enabling the faster movement of funds between exchanges.  Incorporating the technology into the wallet could mean further exploration of these interoperable blockchains for GreenAddress users, with the wallet eventually supporting a wide array of assets and innovations.  Future plans  Looking into the future, the team hopes to continue working on other privacy and security features, including support for smart contract upgrades made to bitcoin, as well as updates to the core bitcoin code such as checklocktimeverify and checksequenceverify.  While bitcoin offers trustless transactions, these features offer ""more trustless"" transactions, according to Nahum.  The team is also working on a multi-platform wallet library, eventually to be open sourced, which will be available across platforms and programming languages.  Overall, Nahum thinks the new ownership will bode well for the wallet’s development.  He concluded:  ""I couldn't wait for the acquisition. I think GreenAddress will flourish better, faster and more robustly than it could ever.""

42399182,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZrh,1469627763,Blockchain Researchers Debate Future of Consensus Tech at IBM Event,"More than 40 researchers met at a workshop hosted by IBM in Chicago this week to discuss the future of the consensus mechanisms that today form the governance layer for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.  Whereas frequent participants in blockchain conferences might assume the event was geared toward informing those new to the technology, Distributed Cryptocurrencies and Consensus Ledgers (DCCL) consisted of high-level academic conversations and was designed to foster communication at the cutting edge of development, according to those involved.  Attendees included well-known cryptocurrency researchers Aviv Zohar and Ittay Eyal.  Event chair and IBM researcher Christian Cachin, who is a contributor to the Hyperledger Project and president of the International Association for Cryptologic Research, told CoinDesk:  ""The audience was predominantly academics with deep technical knowledge of consensus protocols and blockchain security, most of them are active in this space.""  The IBM workshop was designed to give participants the opportunity to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various consensus protocols including so-called ""Nakamoto consensus,"" named after bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  Attendee Jude Nelson of New York City-based Blockstack Labs told CoinDesk the conference was established to serve as a way to galvanize interest in blockchain in the academic community.  According to Nelson, topics discussed included separating block rewards from the coinbases in blockchain systems and building a more efficient gossiping mechanism.  The workshop was part of a larger event hosted by the Association for Computing Machinery and dedicated to a wide range of principles of distributed computing.  Sharing ideas  The event was the culmination of a call by IBM earlier this year to the computer science community for contributions pertaining to cryptocurrencies, with a special focus on the way their underlying protocols help groups reach agreements.  Specifically, IBM Zurich called for papers pertaining to distributed consensus among selfish nodes, mechanisms for consensus ledgers and Nakamoto consensus and protocols based on proof-of-work, among other topics.  The event comes at a time when many are asking deep questions about the nature of consensus mechanisms following the recent, and newly contentious, ethereum hard fork that resulted in two separate blockchains divided between ideological grounds.

42399163,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZgs,1469620705,Bitcoin Trading Platform Coinigy Raises $400k,"Coinigy has raised $400,000 in seed funding to develop an updated version of its bitcoin trading platform.  The funding comes more than a year after the US-based startup raised $100,000 to offer traders real-time charts, news feeds and technical indicators. According to the startup, the new funds come from a single undisclosed angel investor.  The capital will be used to hire additional developers as part of what Coinigy business development lead Derek Urben called the push toward the ""2.0"" version of the platform.  Urben told CoinDesk:  ""I guess the biggest problem we have, which is a really good problem to have, is that we just quite literally don’t have enough hands to type up the code and enough bodies to do all this work.""  Currently, Coinigy’s platform lets users trade digital currencies across multiple platforms, gathering price data from a range of bitcoin and other digital currency services. The plan now is to develop a more comprehensive resource for data and trading capability, while attracting smaller institutional investors.  Urben said that the startup is hoping to grow its subscription-based membership model, and is also looking to attract traders outside of major financial hubs like New York and London.

42399165,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiZft,1469579083,Coinbase: 'Longest Chain' Likely to Decide Ethereum Support,"Coinbase, one of the largest ethereum exchanges by volume and the best capitalized business serving the ecosystem, is reporting it has no ""near-term plans"" to offer support for Ethereum Classic, the alternative version of the ethereum blockchain that has been gaining market traction this week.  Representatives from the San Francisco-based company indicate that the decision extends to both its consumer wallet, as well as GDAX, the digital asset exchange on which it offers trading in both bitcoin and ether.  The company said:  ""In the near term, we’re not planning on adding support for Ethereum Classic.""  The startup, which has raised upwards of $100m in venture funding, however, said it is ""keeping an eye on"" developments as it relates to competition between the two versions of the ethereum blockchain, created over a disagreement over how best to resolve the collapse of a high-profile project called The DAO.  Ethereum Classic has opted to continue maintaining a blockchain history containing transactions that were invalidated on the ethereum blockchain overseen by the majority of developers and voted for by community members.  The statement follows actions taken by major exchanges (including market leaders Poloniex and Kraken) to support the alternative implementation and comes amid growing transaction volume for the digital asset.  Over the last 24 hours, classic ether trading volumes have eclipsed volumes for ether, the native asset on the blockchain network on which Ethereum Classic is based, surpassing $93m amid a 300% rise in value.  As for how it would be measuring the success of Ethereum Classic, representatives said the company would support the ""longest chain"", or the version of the blockchain containing the most sealed transaction blocks.  ""Our guiding light here is that we follow the longest chain, the most popular chain, and that’s what we’re continuing to support,"" the representatives said.  The company noted it is likely to continue to monitor the situation, and that it will continue to watch how developments unfold in the coming weeks.  The comments are notable as Coinbase has been one of the most vocal supporters of the ethereum platform, adding ether buying and selling to its consumer wallets last week.
