With expectations mounting already even amid the crypto winter, there are key factors that stakeholders believe could drive the altcoin’s price as high as $12. ADA Price Could Reach $12 In the last bull market, the ADA price went on a tremendous rally that saw the coin rise from as low as $0.03 to as high as $3.10 at its peak. This price action cemented the token as one of the winners of the bull, and some investors believe that the coin could be poised for another repeat of this price action. One X (formerly Twitter) user has given some points as to why this could be the case. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Burn Rate Sees Exponential 627% Jump In the post, the user points to the current state of interaction and sentiment in the crypto market right now, which they refer to as brutal. However, they do not believe that this will always be the way things will be. According to the user, a quick change in the interaction and sentiment would lead to a rapid price increase. At this point, they believe that most investors will end up entering the asset at a much higher price of $3 and above. This would put it at its previous all-time high. However, it doesn’t end there. They put forward that at the end of the next bull market, the ADA price would be between $8 and $12. $ADA will be a top mover in the bull mrkt once again But most will be jumping in above $3 Interaction & sentiment out here in #crypto is brutal at this point But this will change very quickly – and when it does there will be drastic price movements that most won’t be able… — ADA WON’T BE UNDERVALUED FOREVER (@ADA_ONEVETCOTI) September 23, 2023 As with any forecast, a timeframe is often asked and they responded that they expect this to happen in the second quarter of 2025. This would coincide with the current 4-year cycle that usually sees prices of cryptocurrencies topping out by Q2 and Q3. ADA wavers amid expectations | Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Cardano Is In Better Shape A prominent Cardano influencer has also painted a bullish picture for the digital asset. @cardano_whale, an account that boasts over 137,000 followers on X, said in a tweet that the Cardano network is currently in better shape than it has ever been. Related Reading: Is Cardano (ADA) The Worst Investment Of 2023? Here’s What The Data Says They urged investors who have been increasingly critical of the network to think if they are that way because they are projecting their emotions from the ADA price action onto the network itself. “If you’ve noticed yourself become increasingly negative about it over the last year or so, consider that you might just be projecting emotions from price action onto it,” the post read. Although ADA has not seen the most impressive performance, it has not deterred bullish predictions from analysts. One analyst explained that ADA at $0.25 was a prime accumulation price and that the price of the digital asset could climb as high as $5.

The hacker reportedly moved 1,000 ETH to a separate wallet, 0x799, shortly after compromising the platform and has since remained silent. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Weighs In: Why A Higher XRP Price Is Beneficial For Adoption Huobi Resolves Breach, Offers Hacker Lucrative Deal For Stolen ETH Justin Sun, the Founder of TRON and an Advisor to Huobi, confirmed the incident on X (formerly Twitter), stating that HTX suffered a loss of 5,000 ETH due to the hack. Sun stated: HTX has suffered a loss of 5,000 ETH ($8 million USD) due to a hacker attack. HTX has fully covered the losses incurred from the attack and has successfully resolved all related issues. All user assets are SAFU and the platform is operating completely normally. Sun reassured users that HTX had fully covered the losses and resolved all related issues. He emphasized that user assets were secure and that the platform operated normally. According to Sun, the stolen amount of $8 million represents a relatively small fraction compared to the $3 billion worth of assets held by HTX users and is equivalent to just two weeks’ revenue for the platform. Sun further stated that the hack was detected immediately after the incident on September 24th. HTX swiftly took action to prevent further losses and promptly addressed all issues, restoring the platform to its normal state immediately. Trading operations have continued without interruption. Notably, as an incentive for the hacker to return the stolen funds, HTX offers a 5% white hat reward of $400,000. Additionally, if the hacker returns the funds, they will be considered for a position as a security white hat advisor for HTX. On this matter, Sun claimed: We are willing to offer 5% of the stolen amount (400,000 USD) as a white hat reward to encourage the hacker to return the stolen funds. If the hacker returns the funds, we will also hire them as a security white hat advisor for HTX. However, if the hacker fails to return the funds within seven days, HTX will transfer the information to law enforcement authorities for further action and potential prosecution.

18058288,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552806,1695675642,Crypto’s Six-Week Bleed Out: XRP And Solana Defy The Outflow Downtrend,"With contrasting events in the industry, crypto investment products have witnessed a continuous outflow for the sixth week. Some altcoins demonstrate resilience in this trend, defying the broader market sentiment. Dissecting The Crypto Outflow Trend Crypto funds have witnessed a net outflow of $9 million in the past week, taking the total to roughly $464 million over the last ten weeks, according to Coinshares’ latest digital asset fund flow weekly report. Related Reading: Crypto Fund Flows: Millions Exit Bitcoin, But These Three Coins Hold Their Ground Relevant digital asset management players like CoinShares, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and ProShares have felt the heat of this ongoing trend. To put things into perspective, the outflows have cooled from the previous week’s $54 million, but they still extend the continuous ten-week streak of net capital movement away from these products. A closer look into the report reveals this trend isn’t uniform across regions. Europe has somewhat resisted this wave, recording inflows of $16 million. James Butterfill, Research Head at CoinShares, pinpoints the regional sentiment divergence to varying reactions to the regulatory environment. According to Butterfill, European investors see the “recent regulatory disappointment as an opportunity,” while their US counterparts have pulled out $14 million, possibly due to dismay over recent events. Moreover, trading volumes in crypto funds have reflected the same caution. From exceeding $1 billion in the previous week, the volume plunged to $820 million, substantially less than the yearly average of $1.3 billion. Not All Assets Feel The Pinch Bitcoin, the flag bearer of crypto, hasn’t been immune to this trend, registering outflows for three consecutive weeks, with a dip of $6 million in the past week alone. Interestingly, Short-Bitcoin products, which gain when Bitcoin prices fall, have seen outflows of $2.8 million. This suggests a larger narrative where investors may unwind their bearish bets on Bitcoin. According to Butterfill, this outflow signifies a reduction of 78% in those assets under management over the past 22 weeks. Ethereum, another heavyweight in the crypto arena, has also felt the pinch, with outflows recorded for six weeks consecutively, resulting in a recent reduction of $2.2 million. In contrast to the major players, XRP and Solana are bright spots in the market. This week, they registered inflows of $660,000 and $310,000, respectively. Interestingly, this isn’t the first time these two altcoins have shone amidst the gloom. Last week, both assets witnessed significant inflows. Solana led the way with $700,000, followed by Cardano and XRP, which attracted inflows of $400,000 and $100,000, respectively. While Cardano didn’t cut notable inflows this week, XRP and Solana’s positive inflows amid broader negativity suggest a selective and value-driven approach by some investors in the altcoin market, according to the report. Meanwhile, despite their recorded upward capital movements, XRP and Solana still feel the brunt of the global crypto market downturn. Related Reading: FTX’s Billion-Dollar Solana Liquidation: Market Crash Or Just Hype? Particularly, both assets have been in red, with XRP down by 1.5% in the past day with a current price of $0.50 and Solana seeing a slight 0.5% upward move over the same period with a trading price of $19.60 at the time of writing.

42392521,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg7SGT,1695672865,"U.S. Shutdown, Assuming It Doesn’t Run Long, Will Slow, Not Cripple Crypto Efforts","The crypto industry’s business in Washington is coming to a head just as a looming congressional budget impasse could shut down an array of federal services next week. But the digital assets sector can expect its most important matters won’t go entirely dark, experts suggest, even if they’re dragged out longer than crypto firms had hoped.  The industry’s most urgent needs from the federal government include answers from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, progress in several key court cases and the next hurdles in crypto legislation. It’s unlikely any of those will be entirely derailed.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has warned the agency will operate with a “skeletal” staff during a shutdown, just as his agency is facing deadlines that could determine the future of easily traded crypto ETFs even as its many court cases are steaming toward resolutions that could remake the U.S. crypto industry.  An SEC spokeswoman told CoinDesk that the agency is following its operations plan for shutdowns, a situation it’s faced more than once, including during the Trump administration when the federal government went dark for 35 days. That plan says the agency will halt litigation when possible, unless the situation poses a threat to consumers’ property, and will stop reviewing and approving applications for new products.  That sounds bad for those companies waiting for SEC decisions on bitcoin spot ETF applications and for companies such as Binance that are in the middle of court disputes with the regulator, but those who've been through this process before suggest it probably won’t stop the wheels from turning completely.  Anne Kelley, a longtime former SEC official who is now at Mercury Strategies, said that while the agency’s plan technically “only allows work to be done to prevent a risk of imminent harm to investors, our markets, or property,” it has some budgetary flexibility to use reserved funds.  In 2013, she said, it stayed open “for the entire 16-day shutdown period,” and in 2018, it kept its doors open for a portion of that record shutdown.  “It will be interesting to see if the SEC has the necessary funds this time and whether they decide to stay open,” Kelley said.  One silver lining of a sort: Most of the SEC’s investigations and enforcement activity will grind to a halt, apart from urgent interventions to rescue investors. That means the agency is unlikely to continue what’s been a steady enforcement drumbeat against crypto firms, giving a temporary reprieve to the companies that haven’t been targeted yet.  This week, lawmakers in the House of Representatives are planning to hit Gensler with shutdown questions when he shows up at a Sept. 27 SEC oversight hearing, according to a person familiar with the planning for the House Financial Services Committee’s hearing.  Courts Have Cash  Federal courtrooms are likely to continue operating for a few weeks as normal until the judiciary runs through the cash it collects from court fees and the like.  Near-term disputes such as the legal battle between the SEC and Binance or the similar one with Coinbase should remain in motion for now. If the shutdown were to move past those initial weeks, a reduced version of its workload and staffing takes over under the Anti-Deficiency Act, with limited personnel handling only certain cases.  Those in the cryptocurrency industry who are preparing to tune in to the lengthy criminal trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried next month can seek some assurance from the fact that criminal trials should proceed.  “Federal criminal processes just constitutionally have to continue,” said John Sparacino, a lawyer at McKool Smith. If the shutdown persists, he said, some court activity may slow. “You might start to see some process slowdowns in the bankruptcy courts.”  With so many companies such as FTX, Celsius and Voyager, having tailspun into bankruptcy during last year’s meltdown, some of the industry’s future strength depends on the outcomes of those cases, which should be returning locked-up funds to crypto investors.  Stalled Congress  As for the cryptocurrency sector eventually gaining a system of tailored U.S. rules, the federal legislation that would move in that direction probably isn’t going to be helped by a disrupted Congress.  “If the government shuts down, forward progress on bills will be stalled,” said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, an industry advocacy organization, who says she’s concerned about lawmakers losing the focus that’s been a challenge for the industry to build. “In the aftermath of a shutdown, it is unclear what issues will rise to the top of the priority list in terms of gathering congressional interest. The one thing we know for sure is that the policy world is not static; every week a new issue rises to the top of the list.”  Of course, the House bills that have cleared their committee hurdles – most notably one that would set up top-to-bottom regulations for U.S. crypto markets and another that would establish rules for stablecoins – are generally expected to represent a limited success, because the Senate isn’t likely to pick up the House’s ball and run with it.  Former Sen. Pat Toomey, who now advises Coinbase in policy matters, told CoinDesk TV he thinks the pain from a potential shutdown is being overblown, though he said Congress would necessarily have to focus on getting the budget resolved instead of working on other priorities.  “Does that focus come at the expense of potentially moving crypto related legislation on the House floor? Probably not,” he said. “I think the time frame for getting legislation on the House floor is a little later, maybe November.""  Of course, those comments would assume the shutdown is resolved in less time than it took to end the last one, which stretched almost five weeks. If the impasse goes longer, with conservative Republican lawmakers holding the line on making major cuts to U.S. spending, it may test uncharted waters.  The apparatus of the U.S. government has been growing more accustomed to periodic drama from Congress, so crypto world may not notice a stark difference at first. Of course, a shutdown that blows through previous records would almost certainly begin having heavy repercussions as unpaid employees start finding work elsewhere and government offices run through the final pennies in their rainy-day funds.

MicroStrategy Bolsters BTC Holdings According to a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MicroStrategy has expanded its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring an additional 5,445 BTC, totaling approximately $147.3 million. The average purchase price for these Bitcoins was $27,053 per unit. Related Reading: Ethereum Funding Rates Turn Deep Red, What Does It Mean? With this latest acquisition, MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 158,245 BTC. The company has accumulated this substantial amount of digital assets at an average price of around $29,582 per Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately $4.68 billion. According to the company, these acquisitions underscore MicroStrategy’s commitment to Bitcoin and long-term belief in its potential. The company has been actively accumulating Bitcoin over time, establishing itself as a major participant in the cryptocurrency market. In contrast, MicroStrategy’s stock, listed as MSTR on the Nasdaq, has followed a prolonged downward trend since July 13th. As of the latest trading session, the stock is currently priced at $321.25, reflecting a decrease of 0.14% since the stock market’s opening. Notably, the stock’s performance has exhibited a significant correlation with the value of Bitcoin over the same period, as both have experienced declines. Furthermore, MicroStrategy’s decision to expand its Bitcoin portfolio coincides with a consolidation phase in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has been trading between $25,000 to $27,000 since August 16. The largest cryptocurrency in the market is valued at $26,200, representing a 1.5% decline over the past 24 hours and a decrease of over 4% over the past seven days. Bitcoin Bearish Fractal Holds Strong Renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggests that the bearish Bitcoin fractal, previously highlighted by NewsBTC, remains intact, raising whether the cryptocurrency is still in Phase A-B or has transitioned to Phase B-C, as seen in the chart below. According to Rekt Capita, Bitcoin typically forms a new lower high in Phase A-B, and recent price movements, whether reaching around $29,000 or as low as $27,400, satisfy this criterion. However, a more pronounced lower high is possible if the support level of $25,000 to $26,000 is broken and the Bull Market Support Band becomes resistant. For Phase B-C to commence, two conditions need to be met. Firstly, a relief rally must occur, confirming a new lower high. Secondly, the $25,000 to $26,000 support area must be lost. Although a relief rally forming a new lower high has been witnessed recently, the second condition remains unfulfilled. Phase B-C will be initiated if the $25,000 to $26,000 support area fails. Related Reading: Number Of Ethereum Addresses Losing Money Just Reached A New All-Time High Several key technical events are anticipated. During the downward movement, Bitcoin may briefly touch the $25,000 to $26,000 area. If the price struggles to surpass $26,000 and acts as resistance, it could indicate weakening support in the $25,000 to $26,000 range. In such a case, a collapse to the $22,000 to $24,000 region might occur to establish a local bottom denoted as “C.” To invalidate the bearish Bitcoin fractal, three criteria need to be met. Firstly, the Bull Market Support Band must be held as support. Secondly, a weekly close above the lower high resistance is required. Finally, breaching the yearly high of $31,000 would further challenge the bearish scenario.

42419519,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEpn3,1695671949,Optimism Slumps Most Among Crypto Majors Ahead of $30M Token Unlock,"Optimism (OP) price slid Monday as the Ethereum scaling network’s native token braces for an increase in its circulating supply this week.  The token has a scheduled unlocking event this Saturday, according to Token.Unlocks, which will see the release of 24.16 million of OP or 3% of its circulating supply, worth roughly $30 million. Some $16 million of the assets will be issued to core contributors of the project, while $14 million were earmarked for investors.  Cryptocurrency projects often lock a part of the token’s supply and release it gradually to prevent early investors and insiders from selling in large quantities immediately after they get the allocations. When the tokens are unlocked, they become available to sell, and thus, such events are usually considered bearish; often they induce price drops. However, sometimes investors front-run and may sell before the unlocking happens.

The attack reportedly led to a loss of approximately $200 million worth of crypto funds stolen from its mainnet. Related Reading: What The Drop In Spot And Derivatives Volumes Means For The Price Of Bitcoin Blockchain security platform Peckshield conducted a separate investigation and it was revealed that Mixin network’s total portfolio accounted for approximately $141 million as at the time of the attack. According to the announcement made by the Mixin team on X on Sunday, September 24, 2023, the attack happened during the early hours of September 23, 2023, Hong Kong time. The Mixin network immediately suspended deposits and withdrawals to prevent more losses. However, the Mixin team has assured its users that these services are expected to resume once all vulnerabilities are thoroughly checked and fixed, but in the meantime, transfers are not affected during the period of suspension. In addition, the Mixin team stated that once these vulnerabilities are determined, an announcement will be made later concerning a solution for handling the lost funds. The Mixin team stated that the exchange’s founder Feng Xiaodong will throw more light on the alleged attack on September 25, 2023, in a public Mandarin live stream at 13:00 Hong Kong Time, of which an English version is also expected to come afterwards to cover a wider audience. So far, the exchange has contacted Google and blockchain security company Slowmist to aid in the investigation of the attack. SlowMist also took to X to announce its assistance in the investigation of the attack following a security alert post on September 24, 2023. Mixin is a decentralized network service that offers a high-speed peer-to-peer transactional network for digital assets, which enables other blockchain ledgers to gain high transactions in seconds, and faster transaction confirmations, with low transaction fees. However, it is believed that Mixin which is a decentralized network depended on a centralized database for its network and that led to its vulnerabilities. Mixin Founder Throws More Light On The Attack As promised by the Mixin team that its founder would throw more light on the alleged attack on September 25, 2023, in a Mandarin live stream at 13:00 HKT, the exchange kept its word. During the live stream, Mixin founder Feng Xiaodong stated that the exchange can only guarantee the safety of half of its user’s assets from the affected $200 million worth of crypto assets. Related Reading: Explosive 6-Week Growth Sees Base Hit New Milestone “No matter what your assets are — whether it’s Bitcoin or Ethereum — we will ensure that half of it is unaffected, We are trying to find a way to recover the compromised money, but that is very difficult,” Feng stated. However, for the other half of the funds, Feng added that the Mixin team will issue “bond tokens” for its users to claim which the exchange intends to buy these tokens back from its users in the future. This way, the users get back their funds. Nevertheless, the exchange has promised to establish a new system to host user’s assets with enhanced security measures.

Bitcoin Social Dominance Has Declined To Just 17% Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC-related discussions on social media have dropped recently. The relevant indicator here is “social dominance,” based on the concept of “social volume.” The social volume of any asset is a measure of the degree of talk it receives on the major social media platforms. The metric makes this measurement through a text-based data collection that Santiment has procured from different websites. A feature of the indicator is that it only counts the unique number of posts or messages that mention the coin. This means that if a thread receives many mentions of the cryptocurrency, its contribution to the social volume will remain just one unit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run May Not Begin Until This Ratio Reverses Trend This restriction helps the social volume provide a more accurate representation of the trend being observed throughout social media. The aforementioned social dominance is a metric that tells us what percentage of the combined social volume related to the top 100 assets by market cap is being contributed by any cryptocurrency. Here is a chart that shows how the social dominance of Bitcoin has changed during the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have taken a plunge in recent days | Source: Santiment on X As shown in the above graph, Bitcoin’s social dominance has registered a downtrend during the last few days, implying that the share of the social media discussions occupied by the number one cryptocurrency has shrunken. This is perhaps a result of the asset’s price stagnating recently. Generally, investors don’t find such price action interesting, so they may stop paying attention to the coin during phases like this. With the latest drop in the indicator, its value has dropped to 17%, meaning that 17% of the discussions related to the top 100 coins currently involve the topic of Bitcoin. This level of social dominance is the lowest it has been since June. Related Reading: Ethereum Funding Rates Turn Deep Red, What Does It Mean? Naturally, this drop suggests that the altcoins have recently attracted some attention. Santiment notes that traders are looking elsewhere to FOMO right now, as some of the smaller projects in the market are observing a surge in talks. Historically, the holders dropping BTC in favor of alts has been a sign of greed in the market. Such greed, however, is generally not favorable for the sector as a whole, as only weak rallies emerge in periods like these. BTC Price Bitcoin is trading around the $26,100 level after having decreased by more than 2% during the past 24 hours.

18052303,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552799,1695661232,"Cardano Sees Spike In Development Activity, Can The Price Of ADA Follow?","Cardano (ADA) has been experiencing a persistent downside trend since the start of 2023; the selling pressure has increased in the past week. However, network development continues to grow and could hint at a reversal for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Is Cardano (ADA) The Worst Investment Of 2023? Here’s What The Data Says Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.24 with sideways movement on its weekend price action as of this writing. In the previous seven days, the cryptocurrency recorded a 4%, with the potential for further losses if the price of Bitcoin continues on its current trajectory. Cardano Price Bound For A Change In Trajectory? Data shared by Cardano’s leading developer, Input Output Global (IOG), and seen on the chart below, shows that while ADA has been trending to the downside, network activity is on the rise, with 75.3 million transactions processed, 79,182 token policies, and over 1,250 projects currently building on the network. As seen above, 144 projects have been launched on Cardano with over 8.8 million tokens. This network has been one of the fastest growing in development activity in 2022 and 2023 upon implementing smart contract capabilities via the Hard Fork Combinator event dubbed “Alonzo.” Currently, IOG is working to launch other core improvements to Cardano, including a fix for its consensus algorithm set to improve performance and scalability. In addition, the IOG team has continued to work on its smart contract platform, Plutus, and in the native crypto wallet, Lace. Two of the most significant upcoming events for the blockchain are the introduction of Hydra to improve scalability and Mithril. IOG stated the following about the recent developments for these projects: (…) the team made progress working on the aggregator performance bottleneck that occurs with high client traffic and started creating a new distribution. The above, and the data provided by IOG, could have an impact on ADA. However, additional data provided by TokenTerminal paints a different picture. The crypto analytics firm indicates that Cardano experienced a 6% decrease in its circulating market cap and a 35% loss in its annualized fees. Moreover, while the number of developers working on the network has increased by about 6%, the number of core commits is down 29% in 30 days. Related Reading: Cardano Analysis: How Much Energy Do ADA Bulls Have To Hit $0.3 Milestone? As the chart below shows, the correlation between the number of commits to the project and the price of ADA has been decreasing.

A man in Australia who mistakenly received nearly 10.5 million Australian dollars (AUSD) from Crypto.com will appear in court next month on theft charges, the Guardian reported.  Jatinder Singh will attend a plea hearing on Oct. 23 at the County Court of Victoria in Australia for failing to report that he received AUSD 10.47 million (roughly $6.7 million) from Crypto.com in 2021. Singh used the money –sent to him because of an accounting error – to buy four houses, cars, art, furniture and other things, The Guardian reported.  A lawyer for Singh wasn’t immediately available to respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  The accounting error occurred when a Crypto.com worker accidentally entered Singh's account number into a company spreadsheet tracking customer refunds, according to the publication. The company discovered the massive overpayment seven months later, in December 2021.  Singh attempted to transfer funds into a Crypto.com account in 2020, using the bank account of his partner, Thevamanogari Manivel. However, the company rejected the payment and attempted to refund Singh roughly AUSD 64 because the name on the bank account did not match the name on the Crypto.com account.  Singh discovered he had been overpaid the day after receiving the millions of dollars from Crypto.com. After becoming aware of the error, he instructed his partner to transfer much of the funds to a joint Westpac account, and transferred AUSD 4 million to a bank account in Malaysia, The Guardian reported.

Here’s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency’s price. Ethereum Funding Rates Have Been Under The Zero Mark Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a short squeeze may be a possibility for the asset currently. The “funding rate” is an indicator that keeps track of the periodic fees that traders on the futures market are exchanging with each other. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the long contract holders are paying a premium to the short holders right now. Such a trend implies the longs outweigh the shorts currently, and hence, a bullish mentality is the dominant force in the sector. On the other hand, negative values suggest the majority of the futures market users share a bearish sentiment at the moment as the shorts are the ones paying a fee. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run May Not Begin Until This Ratio Reverses Trend Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum funding rates over the past week: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite negative in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum funding rates had been positive until just a couple of days back, implying that the majority of the futures traders had been betting on the asset’s price to go up. The metric’s value has plunged to the negative zone during the past day or so, however, suggesting that a complete flip in mentality has occurred among the investors. This bearish sentiment, though, may not necessarily be bad for the price. This is because the more the mentality has become skewed in one direction historically, the more probable the price of the cryptocurrency has become to show a sharp move in the opposite direction. One major reason why this happens is that mass liquidation events, which are popularly called “squeezes,” are more likely to involve the dominant side of the futures market. During a squeeze, a sudden swing in the price ends up liquidating a large amount of contracts at once. Such liquidations only provide fuel for the price move that caused them, thus amplifying it further. This can lead to a cascade of more liquidations. Related Reading: “Paper BTC” Is Counteracting A Bullish Bitcoin Supply Shock, Analyst Explains As shorts have piled up in the Ethereum futures market recently, the probability of a short squeeze occurring would be elevated. Naturally, if such an event does take place, the asset’s value could see a sharp rebound. This doesn’t necessarily have to happen, of course, and if it does, it may not be soon. From the chart, it’s visible that the funding rate had remained at notable positive values for a while before the ETH price finally registered its plunge.

42419523,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEptF,1695654842,How Much Does the First Mover Advantage Matter for Crypto Staking?,"Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade has been the catalyst for the emergence of new financial demand for liquid staking derivatives, an emerging class of assets also called LSDs. Following a brief period of uncertainty about withdrawing capital, ether (ETH) staking participation has surged by 95% over the past year to approximately $41.6 billion from just over $22 billion, according to Dune Analytics.  This article is part of ""Staking Week."" Jordi Alexander is the chief investment officer at Selini Capital, and the chief alchemist at Mantle.  However, amid the meteoric rise of decentralized finance's (DeFi) latest investment vehicle, there’s a growing concern regarding the consolidation of power within the nascent sub-sector as large staked ETH pools accumulate across a small number of players. The emerging market of liquid staking derivatives finance, or LSDFi, is dominated by a select few.  With decentralization core to the blockchain ethos, Ethereum’s most vocal advocates have been united in spearheading distributed validator technology to quell centralization fears. As we inch closer to the next era of the ubiquitous smart contract blockchain ecosystem, what lies ahead for the future of staking? And could concerted collaboration in fact push the industry towards a more decentralized future?  First move advantage in a decentralized age  Understanding the reasons behind increasing centralization within the LSD market necessitates a deep-dive into the broader landscape. The premise of capital efficiency and long-term yields is an irresistible allure for retail and institutional investors alike.  The explosive growth of LSDFi, with its three-pronged offer of yield maximization, capital liquidity and network security validation has been garnering attention from players in conventional finance. At the same time, for crypto-native traders who approach Ethereum with a long-term horizon, active staking participation serves as a logical next step.  See also: Staking Brings Decentralization Back to DeFi | Opinion  This interest fueled the creation of a specialized LSD service offerings, donimated by a few early entrants. Critics of the nascent LSD market have argued this disproportionate control by a few potentially stifles equitable access and market advancement.  Post-Shanghai, the Ethereum upgrade that allowed validators to withdraw their staked ether, many stakers have withdrawn bulk of their ETH rewards and moved to popular LSD providers like Lido and Rocket Pool. These players were best positioned to capture these flows due to their potential for immediate liquidity through on-chain pools, expansive utility of liquid staking tokens as DeFi collateral and added accessibility to new staking innovations such as EigenLayer.  Issues around regulatory risk faced by centralized exchanges further encouraged the move towards liquid staking providers, who have yet to face such intense scrutiny. The first-mover advantage of these LSD primitives who established the initial infrastructure and liquidity pools resulted in a pendulum swing of market share distribution to be heavily weighted towards such players.  It’s important to note this was not a malicious orchestration. Dominance by players including the likes of Lido and Rocketpool is in code, and not control — rather, it’s a natural outcome that speaks volumes to daring innovation in uncharted terrain.  Efforts to establish effective governance over decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which manage a number of crypto protocols including Lido, deserve further recognition for attempts to develop robust frameworks to advance decentralized and self-custodial ethics, enabling credible neutrality and permissionless innovation on Ethereum.  Let’s seize this opportunity to course-correct  By allowing users to implement safe compounding yield strategies, alongside market-making opportunities to provide further earning potential, decentralized LSD providers, including Rocket Pool, Frax Finance and Lido, have brought significant merit to the Ethereum ecosystem by securing coveted institutional and retail buy-in.  Such trailblazers have strengthened the overall repute of DeFi and Web3 by credibly lowering entry barriers like high upfront capital, lock-in periods, complexities in technical know-how — bridging the gap to substantively, and sustainably, establish a new financial system.  Preserving permissionless: A subtle balance  Despite the momentum, crypto and DeFi are miles away from achieving the goal of mass adoption. At the same time, threats to crypto's core tenets of decentralization and self-custody grow more urgent as it incrementally reaches critical mass. Finding a way forward that preserves decentralization, noting the realities of today's market, is essential.  The latest push in distributed validator technology provides such a path towards a more decentralized and resilient Ethereum ecosystem. But keeping hold of crypto's core tenets in a fast-evolving industry requires deliberate action — not letting competition completely determine where the market will lead, and fostering cooperation.  By pooling the resources of decentralized protocols, layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions and DAOs, staking presents immense potential to expand the Web3 pie for all by proliferating unique LSDFi innovations in the market. This is another level of interoperability, not just at the technical level but making sure a contingent of the industry remains committed to decentralization.  On the building front, it is simply more cost efficient to deploy and maintain advanced DeFi protocols and other computing-intensive apps on L2s, which are seeing a jump in stakers and ousers of other LSDFi activities. Ethereum's emerging scalability solutions (and items in the pipeline like danksharding) are a pressure release for the World Computer.  By letting L2s take care of infrastructural tooling needs, developer support and liquidity provision, app teams are able to consolidate resources to focus on app-specific strategies.  I’m of firm belief that liquid capital will remain in LSDFi and, as a result, infrastructural ecosystems should be built for the user as well as the protocols. Growth and longevity across L2s will therefore need to cater to diverse DeFi user bases, while actively streamlining cross-collaborations to capitalize on synergies across platforms.  Take the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA): This sub-sector is gaining traction for use-cases that strike the balance between DeFi and centralized finance. Bringing RWA into the LSD realm is imminent as technically, anything that bears yield and is stackable could become an LSD.  Taking this a step further, there is potential for a decentralized stablecoin partially backed by both LSD and RWA primitives to supercharge an effective yield strategy and reduce dependencies on today's dominant providers. (The Mantle ecosystem is planning to launch an LSD product.)  See also: How Tokenized Governance Can Make DeFi More Resilient  Soon, we’ll also see LSD integrations into other DeFi sub-sectors such as perps and option markets. As mentioned, LSDs can be made from any yield-generating asset meaning this market can evolve in unpredictable directions.  This version of Web3 that preserves decentralization will depend on getting users to actively participate in token-governed technologies. This will require making staking more streamlined for users by increasing composability across the ecosystem, upending information asymmetry and taking a hands-on approach to what users want.

With the bears winning at a much higher rate than the bulls, Ethereum holders have found their holdings have continued to lose value. This time around, the plunge has sent the number of investors losing money to a new all-time high. Number Of Ethereum Addresses In Loss At ATH On-chain data tracker Glassnode Alerts on X (formerly Twitter) has revealed a shocking development regarding Ethereum addresses. According to the tracker, the number of addresses seeing losses on a 7-day moving average (MA) has jumped to its highest level ever. Related Reading: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Reveals The Challenges Of The Network This metric takes note of the price at which the ETH coins being held on addresses were last moved. Then it is compared to the current price of the altcoin to figure out if the addresses are seeing gains or losses. The metric had been rapidly climbing in 2023 due to the bear market, culminating in a new all-time high. According to Glassnode’s report, the total number of addresses in loss is now sitting at 49,939,211.006, rising from its previous all-time high of 49,921,736.464 that was reached on September 15. If the price of ETH continues to drop, then this figure will likely hit another all-time high soon. Number of addresses in loss hit new all-time high Source: Glassnode Other ETH Metrics Flashing Bearish Ethereum’s open interest in perpetual futures contracts had also taken a hit with the price struggles. It dropped to a one-month low $445,789,354, just weeks after hitting a previous one-month low of $450,965,900 on September 13. Accumulation also seems to be dropping among mid-sized investors in the meantime. Glassnode also reports that the number of addresses holding at least 10 ETH had plunged to a 3-month low of 347,825. This suggests that these investors may be offloading their holdings to prevent more losses. Small investors are also not left out of this trend. Another metric that tracks the number of Ethereum addresses holding at least 0.1 ETH also showed a decline in recent months. This has led to a 5-month low for the metric, with only 5,120,950 addresses holding 0.1+ ETH. Related Reading: Bitwise Withdraws Application, A Big Blow To Ethereum ETFs? These declines come as no surprise as the ETH price had lost support above $1,600. With the bears dragging the price below $1,600, the losses for holders had climbed rapidly as the altcoin’s price fell to two-week lows. Founder Vitalik Buterin had also made transactions carrying a significant amount of ETH toward centralized exchanges. This has sparked speculations that the founder is selling, which in turn could influence investors to sell as well.

The ECB is due to take major decisions over whether to press ahead with preparations for the CBDC in the coming weeks, but many members of the European Parliament – who would need to sign off on the plans – appear skeptical.  “It’s not until later in October that the [ECB] Governing Council will decide whether we can move ahead with more piloting of the project,” ECB President Christine Lagarde told lawmakers on the EU Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. “The pilot will probably take us another two years, at least, before it’s the final say.”  If “we can address all the conspiracy theories that abound about this – as if Big Brother was going to suddenly determine what you buy, when you buy it and how restricted it should be – then I think it would be characterized as a success,” Lagarde said, adding that the digital euro will need to offer privacy without full anonymity, and be user-friendly, free and universal.  ECB Board Member Fabio Panetta has previously promised there’ll be no decision to issue until lawmakers and the bloc's member governments agree on legislation to set out privacy measures for the CBDC, and they still have plenty of qualms.  “How do you check all the major privacy concerns if you ask for transaction and holding limits, and identification, with the consequence of total traceability?” German centrist lawmaker Nicola Beer asked Lagarde on Monday, referring to ECB plans intended to curb money laundering and stop large CBDC holdings from upending the commercial banking system. “Will this not hinder the acceptance of the digital euro?”  Last month, the parliament announced that the digital euro law will be shepherded through the parliament by Germany’s Stefan Berger, an architect of the EU’s crypto licensing law MiCA.

42419527,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEpvJ,1695652337,We Need to Reclaim the Narrative on Staking,"A year ago, a major event called the Merge took place, rapidly improving how Ethereum operates. While this engineering feat made Ethereum more energy efficient and capable of handling more transactions at faster speeds, it also caused certain U.S. federal regulators to pay greater attention.  Last year, SEC Chair Gary Gensler Gary Gensler suggested that transitioning to proof of stake might make ether a security. Gensler said allowing tokenholders to stake tokens results in “the investing public anticipating profits based on the efforts of others” and further that “offering staking services to its customers “looks very similar — with some changes of labeling — to lending.”  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Staking Week, sponsored by Foundry.  As someone who spends her time educating lawmakers about crypto and PoS technology, these statements showed that there was a critical need for us to educate lawmakers, regulators and the general public on the distinctions between crypto lending and securing a protocol.  Nearly two months later, the implosion of FTX heightened regulatory scrutiny of the industry in general, and eventually staking-as-a-service (StaaS) programs specifically. In February, the SEC announced an enforcement action against digital asset exchange Kraken related to their custodial staking services. The agency put other StaaS providers on notice that they need to “come in and register.” Later, the SEC sued digital asset exchange Coinbase on a number of counts, including the allegation that Coinbase’s staking services are unlawful. Then several state regulators alleged that Coinbase violated securities laws by offering “staking rewards programs” to residents without registration.  Read more: The State of Staking: 5 Takeaways a Year After Ethereum's Merge  This past July Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden and Finance Committee Ranking Member Mike Crapo specifically requested comments on taxation of digital assets with a section devoted to the taxation of staking rewards. Industry leaders and trade groups including POSA, the Blockchain Association, CCI, Polygon Labs, Coin Center, and others solidified the near universal agreement of industry that staking rewards should be taxed like all other created property: at the time of sale, not at the time of creation. Yet, the IRS’s first published opinion on staking Revenue Ruling 2023-14 suggested that some staking rewards should be taxed as ordinary income in the year that the taxpayer gains control over the rewards. In August, Treasury and IRS also issued proposed regulations on reporting by brokers for sales or exchanges of digital assets, excluding validators on PoS networks from such reporting requirements (but elsewhere in the 200-plus page document suggested there may be requirements for others).  The U.S. is not the only jurisdiction focused on regulating staking. In the U.K., FCA rules set to go into effect next month classify staking programs as “complex yield arrangements” similar to crypto-asset lending and borrowing.  All of this to say: There has been a lot of regulatory action in this space recently but there is a lot that remains unclear. What is clear is that there is an increased need for better explanations about how this technology works, what staking is and why it matters.  Defining staking  PoS blockchains, like Ethereum, enable all token-holders, not just those with industrial-scale computer systems, to benefit from securing and in many cases governing the network. The more token owners stake, the more secure, neutral, and sustainable these networks are. Today, almost every major blockchain relies on staking in order to function. PoS blockchains have grown to include 19 of the top 20 smart contract platforms with millions of users globally, representing a market cap of nearly $100 billion as of this month.  Given the importance of staking, why have StaaS providers been the subject of regulatory scrutiny? In part, because there is still confusion around the term. While the term staking refers to the process of securing a PoS network, as a number of industry experts have pointed out, the term is often confused, and more recently co-opted, to describe a variety of activities that do not involve validating transactions on a blockchain. These other activities typically involve users receiving payments for storing or transferring certain digital assets to a third-party that exercises discretion over the assets and uses them for a variety of activities, some of which may be risky.  And yet even in those cases, assertions that facilitating individual participation in the securing of PoS blockchain networks constitutes an unregistered security are misguided. Participation in a particular consensus mechanism used by a blockchain is not the type of activity that the U.S. federal securities laws were designed to regulate.  In 2020, POSA developed and published principles for participants in PoS protocols that offer staking services. Those abiding by these principles should be regulated like the technical service providers they are – instead of as providers of a financial product. Their services were technical then, and they remain technical today.  In her dissent in the Kraken settlement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce cited these principles, saying that “solutions need not come from a regulator.” POSA continues to urge all participants in PoS blockchain ecosystems to ensure that the space is characterized by long-term, responsible growth – instead of short term profit-driven incentives.  The broader crypto industry is at a unique historical moment. A year after the Merge, persistent confusion and misconceptions about staking continue to affect how we are governed. There’s a clear need for industry leaders to agree on appropriate terms and standards of what is and isn’t staking, and to the extent that there is risk involved, what the nature of that risk truly is – technical, instead of financial.  The staking industry should come together, once again align on industry principles and do the hard work of educating lawmakers and regulators to foster a thriving PoS ecosystem. Until that happens, America’s digital asset industry will continue to be clouded in uncertainty and unable to fulfill its potential. For the sake of all participants in PoS ecosystems, I hope we can end that confusion soon.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Alison Mangiero,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/25/we-need-to-reclaim-the-narrative-on-staking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6948369d066d60879fd061e1da9c7bf2760c77ac-3620x2475.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The international move by Bengaluru-based Mudrex is rare for Indian entities that have mostly struggled due to harsh taxes and a global crypto winter. Even rarer is its ""bullish plan"" for global expansion, revealed in this detail for the first time. ""Half our team is working on international expansion,"" said Patel.  Mudrex has also started the approval process to operate in the U.K., he said.  Mudrex was approved for registration with Italy's Organismo Agenti e Mediatori (OAM), a mandatory step for crypto firms, on Sep. 1, 2023. OAM is the local legal entity which maintains lists of financial agents operating in the country subject to the nation's anti-money-laundering requirements. ""We just wanted some time to pass after the approval before we made the news public,"" said Patel.  Mudrex has only one million registered users but is one of India's largest crypto platforms that offer index investing options through sets of coins called Coin Sets as an alternative to speculative trading. This includes small, mid and large cap, BTC and ETH in the broad-based category. The thematic indexes include layer one, layer two, NFT, Metaverse projects and Dow trackers.  ""While India is our base and where we grew up, customers abroad told us investment products there are all the same,"" said Patel. ""We believe that our product is unique and has some very different offerings.""  Patel said we chose Italy because a survey by Italy's securities regulator Consob on financial investments of Italian households revealed data points that suited our products such as higher risk diversification, higher gross saving and higher knowledge of crypto than most other EU nations. ""We shortlisted through this research but Italy gave us the best results on the ground.""  According to Mudrex, the Italian foray was made easier because the company had already fulfilled the requirements to operate in the EU after obtaining a licence in Lithuania less than a year ago. In the six months it pursued registration in Italy, Mudrex's presence in the EU rose from around 5,000 users to 17,000.  ""Now we can offer our investment products via all other registered entities like banking partner apps and we are in talks with them,"" Patel said.

42419526,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEpsD,1695649795,Staking Brings Decentralization Back to DeFi,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) has a problem. We set out to build a financial alternative, driven by the shortcomings of opaque businesses that often put their interests over those of their customers. The goal was a decentralized, self-governed economy that was transparent and largely independent from external influences.  Instead, crypto markets today hang on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s every word, run almost entirely on centralized stablecoins and are onboarding real-world bonds as collateral assets.  This article is part of ""Staking Week."" Conor Ryder is the head of research and data at Ethena Labs.  While I’m fully aligned with a pragmatic approach — making short-term sacrifices that give us a better chance of reaching an end goal — the time has come to accept that DeFi as it stands today is not so decentralized. Blockchain finance might be a better term.  But crypto native staking yields can help bring us back to DeFi.  How have we got to this point?  Stablecoins  Many previous attempts at decentralized stablecoins have fallen by the wayside. In short, this is because they either have struggled to scale and compete with their centralized counterparts, or they scaled too quickly based on fundamentally flawed designs.  Decentralized stablecoins are the holy grail, but we have seen a lack of innovation in the space since the collapse of Terra. Novel approaches are dismissed immediately if they dare suggest anything but an overcollateralized approach. DeFi was left scarred and shaken after Terra, and an emphasis since then has been placed on security, at the expense of innovation.  Centralized stablecoins power DeFi today, with more than a 95% market share of on-chain volumes versus their more decentralized counterparts. Web2 incumbents like PayPal entering the stablecoin space will only exacerbate this trend. Centralized stablecoins are built to get into as many hands as possible and have spread quickly throughout DeFi as a result. On the other hand, overcollateralized stablecoins, constrained by their design, have lagged behind and failed to achieve the same level of adoption.  While it’s positive to see stablecoin adoption, regardless of who issues them, it's important for DeFi to offer a competitive decentralized stablecoin that can stand on its own two feet and put the “De” back in DeFi.  Yields  Second, the rise of U.S. bond yields has shifted the real risk-free rate to 5%, leaving crypto collateral assets that earn little to no passive income facing a competitive mountain to climb. If you are a struggling crypto protocol, where decentralization isn’t your first priority, moving your collateral into a risk-free asset earning 5% yield makes a lot of sense. However, this hasn’t just been struggling protocols onboarding real world assets (RWAs) in search of higher yield — some of DeFi’s biggest blue chips have shifted a large portion of their assets into RWAs. According to rwa.xyz, tokenized treasuries are up from $100 million at the start of 2023 to over $600 million today.  The speed and rate of adoption of U.S. Treasuries and RWA’s should make us question the industry’s commitment to decentralization. To be clear, it’s fine if we have other goals, like moving finance on the blockchain à la PayPal USD or Visa settling transactions via USDC on Solana. But let’s be honest about the state of DeFi today: it’s Blockchain Finance running on U.S Treasuries and centralized stablecoins. That may modernize finance and bring more users onto crypto rails, but we need to start building out solutions that serve as decentralizing forces to the space to provide viable options for holding money outside the banking system.  Where do we go from here?  Enter crypto staking yields, or more specifically, “post-Shapella” staking yields. Since the Shapella upgrade of the Ethereum network, users can stake and unstake their ether (ETH) at will, significantly de-risking staked ETH from a liquidity standpoint. This has been reflected in the staked ether, or stETH, discount to ETH, barely dipping past 30 bps since Ethereum’s last major upgrade. Before the Shapella upgrade, stETH was a poor collateral asset due to its illiquidity and discount volatility. Now that stETH has been derisked, we have seen it overtake ETH as the primary collateral asset throughout DeFi.  See also: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking?  This means that DeFi now has a yield-bearing collateral asset that is native to crypto as well as being decentralized. StETH yields rival bond yields at 4%-5% and give protocols another option without the censorship risk profile of bonds. This will only help decentralize DeFi as protocols and stablecoins can now build on top of stETH rather than RWA’s and evolve independently of the traditional banking system.  An interesting addendum is that we are quite likely at the top of a rate cycle for bond yields and interest rates, meaning that in a few years’ time we could see staked ETH yields outpace bond yields. In that scenario, the decision to hold RWA’s for crypto protocols would be difficult to justify. At that point, we might just see DeFi become truly self-sufficient, built upon crypto-native, yield-bearing collateral.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | ENA | PYUSD,Conor Ryder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/09/25/staking-brings-decentralization-back-to-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cfdc3c9a9c5de9562364c6e49387e6b552d9ff39-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have taken the hit, losing 3% and 4% of their past week’s gains, respectively. However, Chainlink (LINK) resisted the prevailing bearish market forces amid this onslaught, holding 6.51% gains on the weekly chart. Also, the token has recorded a 1.68% price increase in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Drop To $20,000? EURUSD Correlation Indicates It Might Amid the upturn, LINK has broken past the $7 price mark; could it ride the prevailing bullish waves to record new highs? Let’s find out. ChainLink’s Daily Active Addresses Hits A 2-Month High LINK’s price uptick comes amid a significant increase in active unique addresses on the network. Data from leading on-chain analytics firm Santiment shows that Chainlink’s unique addresses exceeded 3,900 for the first time since July 21. Furthermore, this uptick indicates increased network activity and engagement, reflecting the rising community interest and involvement. Moreover, increasing unique active addresses is often synonymous with increased usage and adoption of the network’s native token, LINK. And this could be seen in the increase in LINK’s market value over the past seven days. In addition, an update on Chainlink adoption shows four of the network’s services integrated across six different chains. These chains include Arbitrum, Avax, BNB Chain, Etherem, Optimism, and Polygon. Again, these integrations further reflect a wider usage of the LINK token and increased participation in the Chainlink ecosystem. It shows that more people are adopting Chainlink, exerting a higher buying pressure on LINK, a plausible explanation for the ongoing price uptick. Chainlink (LINK) Breaks The $7 Resistance; What’s Next? The daily LINKUSD chart below suggests that LINK is gearing up to hit $8 as it conquers critical barriers while buy pressure remains high. After posting notable gains over the past eight days, LINK trades above two key support levels, $5.72 and $6.595. The token’s price oscillated between these key price levels from mid-August to September 18. Meanwhile, all this time, LINK traded below two critical points, the 200-day and 50-day moving averages ($6.488 and $6.706), before a sharp spike pushed it above $6.8. It maintained the momentum through the past few days, breaking the $7.00 barrier, and now targets the $7.8 resistance level. Related Reading: Is Terra Classic Planning For USTC To Be Pegged To The Dollar Again? LINK now trades above the 50 and 200-day price levels, indicating a strong bullish momentum in the market. If the ongoing buy frenzy continues, LINK could reclaim the year-high of $8.898, recorded on November 7, 2022. And if the buying strength continues to increase, the token could even set a new record high in the coming days. However, while LINK has regained over 21% of its past month’s gains in the ongoing rally, the token remains 9% down from its year-high, and he bulls must increase momentum for the token to reclaim this level.

42419534,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEq3Z,1695645969,First Mover Americas: Aptos Rallies While Major Cryptos Trade Lower,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  A token that’s designed to fool users into thinking it's an authentic version of Aptos temporarily shut down services on Korean exchange Upbit for the APT token after some were able to deposit and cash out the counterfeit coin. According to on-chain data, the token, which originated from the airdrop scam site ClaimAPTGift.com, is held by approximately 400,000 wallets. On X (formerly known as Twitter), one user highlighted a bug on Upbit that caused the exchange to accept the fake tokens because it didn’t thoroughly check the underlying source code.  Aptos’ APT token was one of the only digital asset tokens trading in the green on Monday, rallying 10% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, traded down almost 2% over the same time period. Chainlink’s LINK was the only other digital asset that gained on Monday, up 2% after a strong week last week. Looking forward, eToro analyst Simon Peters noted in a morning update that this week looks slow for cryptocurrencies due to few macroeconomic updates. “With little in the way of major macro updates this week, there is little to stir the market bar unplanned events,” said Peters. “The market is looking for signals to take a direction and has been moving fairly flat for some time now.”  On Friday at 08:00 UTC, a total of 1.217 million bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) options contracts with a notional value of $4.8 billion will expire on leading crypto options exchange Deribit. Roughly 10% or 117,000 contracts out of the total are tied to bitcoin, while the rest are ether options. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC and one ETH. Options are derivatives that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying at a predetermined price at a later date. These derivatives contracts will be valuable or worthless depending on how the top two cryptocurrencies trade by the end of the week. Both seasoned traders and retail investors track monthly and quarterly options expiries, given their propensity to influence markets ahead of and following the settlement.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows gaming and cryptocurrency trading platform Rollbit's revenue from casino games, sportsbook and futures trading has increased 10% or more in the past 30 days.  The uptick in revenue contradicts the downtrend in Rollbit's RLB token. The cryptocurrency's price has decreased by 44% in the past four weeks, per Messari.  ""While Rollbit's revenue is steadily increasing, the token price is going down. $1.3M worth of RLB was bought back & burned only last week. I expect the RLB price to eventually catch up to the fundamentals,"" pseudonymous crypto analyst The DeFi investor said.

18046433,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552761,1695645022,Ripple CTO Weighs In: Why A Higher XRP Price Is Beneficial For Adoption,"In an era where crypto analysis is ever-evolving, some sentiments retain their significance. This was underscored when XRP influencer Crypto Eri delved into a statement from Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, that, although over five years old, still echoes pertinently within today’s cryptocurrency discourse. When Crypto Eri shed light on this older response from Schwartz, she revisited a debate on XRP’s value dynamics. The query, which originated on Quora, surrounded the speculation that institutions might prefer XRP’s price to remain low for optimizing transaction processes. However, Schwartz’s comprehensive clarification brought forth an opposing perspective. Ripple CTO Weighs In On XRP Price And Liquidity Schwartz articulated that the presumption of banks or financial entities wanting a subdued XRP price is an overreach. He pointed out a fundamental relationship, stating, “Higher prices tend to correlate with higher liquidity, which means cheaper payments.” To elucidate further, he ventured into the intricacies of how XRP functions as a payment medium. Related Reading: ASO Bullish Cross Reveals Bull Run Start For XRP: Crypto Analyst Drawing an analogy with Bitcoin, Schwartz offered a more vivid understanding. If one were to transact $1 million at a time when Bitcoin was valued at a mere $100, the liquidity constraints would induce significant price volatility. As Schwartz elaborated, “… trying to buy enough Bitcoin to buy the house, you’d push the price up significantly. And when the recipient tried to convert those bitcoins into their local currency, they’d push the price down significantly.” However, as Bitcoin rose and crossed the $10,000 threshold (at the time of Schwartz’s contribution), its vulnerability to price fluctuations for larger transactions had decreased. Schwartz attributed this stability to the increased value, which requires a smaller share of total assets to facilitate significant transfers. When drawing parallels, he emphasized that XRP behaves similarly. Therefore, a rising XRP price would undoubtedly make it a superior channel for high-value transactions for the Ripple payment solutions. Schwartz Clarifies (More) Rumors Beyond this age-old yet continually relevant perspective, Schwartz remains active in enlightening the community on diverse XRP-related queries. Addressing a recent Twitter proposition about XRP potentially bolstering the top 1%, Schwartz replied with a rebuttal, “I’m not sure I understand this claim. The top 1% of what exactly? XRP empowers anyone who wants to use the ledger to track the ownership and exchange of assets. What kind of control is he talking about exactly?” Related Reading: XRP Price Poised For A 250% Surge, Analyst Points To This Key Catalyst On speculations of the Department of Homeland Security’s capability to ‘hack’ XRP, Schwartz demystified, “I’m not sure what a hack of XRP would even mean. The ledger contents are public. The rules are public… No such bug is known, of course. And any exploited bug would be fixed, so you couldn’t hack it the same way twice.” Lastly, when probing the connection between an old patent of his and XRP’s architectural design, Schwartz elucidated, “I can’t see any real connection between my patent and XRPL design… the patent became mostly irrelevant.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.4952.

Price action, in particular, has had Bitcoin breaking below the $26,500 support, indicating a potential risk of more losses below the $26,000 support in the near term. Some analysts, however, are still betting on a new Bitcoin bull run in the near future. According to crypto analyst “Titan of Crypto”, the Bitcoin price is poised for a huge surge over the next year that could see it double in value or more. Crypto Analyst Predicts 100% Bitcoin Price Increase The crypto analyst, who goes by the X handle @Titan of Crypto, believes Bitcoin is poised for massive gains leading up to the next halving event in 2024 based on historical price patterns.

Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results. However, if history repeats itself, the price of Bitcoin could double from $26,130 to $48,700 based on the analyst’s prediction. A similar prediction from the analyst puts the next peak for Bitcoin’s current cycle at $108,000. BTC price struggling to hold $26,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com The Bitcoin halving, which cuts the block reward for miners in half, has been known to have a bullish effect on Bitcoin. A similar prediction by equity research firm Fundsrat to its clients predicted the next halving to have a bullish effect on the price of Bitcoin. While the next halving isn’t slated to occur until April 2024, analysts have predicted Bitcoin rising before then. Another analyst who goes by the X handle @100trillionUSD also predicted a series of events before the next halving, with a Bitcoin price rise being one of them. This checkbox has been marked, as Bitcoin has risen from $18,000 since the beginning of the year. According to him, the 2024 halving should meet Bitcoin at a price greater than $32,000 and a bull market will push Bitcoin above $100,000.

The company demonstrates strong financial management with a dramatic reduction in operational expenses. We place a 'Buy' rating on Coinbase. Coinbase ( COIN ) in the intricate tapestry of the cryptocurrency world, has carved a distinctive niche for itself. Its blend of meticulous financial strategy with innovative interventions has rightfully positioned it as a vanguard in the realm of digital currencies. We believe that at current prices there is a moderate Risk/Reward ratio and we are placing a rating of 'Buy' on the stock. We believe at current price levels Coinbase offers a discount for exposure to the whole crypto ecosystem. In the following article we will dive in to the details of Coinbase's operations, why we believe COIN offers upside and we offer recommendations for investors to help manage the volatility associated with Coinbase's pricing. Operational Review Q2 Coinbase, traditionally recognized as a cryptocurrency exchange, is witnessing a notable diversification in its revenue streams. Despite the anticipated dip in consumer transaction revenue — a direct consequence of the significant price drops in Bitcoin and Ethereum in recent quarters — the surge in other revenue sources is striking. The growth is particularly evident in blockchain rewards. However, the standout performer is the interest income, which has seen a meteoric rise from $32.5 million to an impressive $201.4 million in Q2 2023. Coinbase The company's latest earnings report is emblematic of its ability to stay ahead, even in turbulent times. Reporting an adjusted EBITDA of $194 million in the recent quarter is no minor feat especially when compared to Q2 2022 where revenue was $140 million greater but losses were $345 million greater. Such figures are rarely the result of serendipity; they often echo a brand's prowess in financial management. It's remarkable to note the company's conscious efforts in reducing operational expenses by nearly 50% year-over-year. This achievement is not just about numbers; it’s a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic foresight. Lowering operational expenses this dramatically opens up further operational leverage down the line. While this reduction in Opex is massive it does raise some concerns around why they had that level of spending to begin with considering how easy it has been for them to reduce the costs. With that said, if another strong crypto rally emerges Coinbase is more than prepared to capture significant upside. Coinbase Coinbase In an industry where trust can be more than elusive, Coinbase has managed to stand out as a beacon of reliability. Across diverse markets, the brand has managed to foster a reputation synonymous with trustworthiness in the crypto arena. Such reputations are cultivated over time and are a product of unwavering commitment, transparent operations, and a user-centric approach. This earned trust is evident not just in its primary trading platform but also in its diversified offerings. With ventures spanning from versatile financial products like savings, rewards, and the pioneering Coinbase card to its forays into the revolutionary Web3 space, Coinbase’s strategy is unmistakably holistic and offers ecosystem wide upside. Changing Dynamics An interesting insight from the company’s data is the evolving user engagement with cryptocurrencies. What was once predominantly seen as a volatile trading asset is now being embraced for its multifaceted utility. This shift underscores a broader evolution in the crypto market and aligns seamlessly with Coinbase's forward-looking vision, which sees the role of crypto expanding beyond just trading and becoming a part of digital life. On the international stage, Coinbase's ambitions are clearly delineated. The initiation of a derivatives exchange in a curated list of international markets signals its commitment to broaden its horizons. But its global aspirations don't stop at mere market expansion. Coinbase is methodically embedding itself in the institutional framework of the cryptocurrency world. This is evident in its strategic positioning in the realm of ETF applications, indicating its readiness to be an institutional pivot in the crypto sphere. As leading Crypto Exchange Binance continues to wobble we expect to see Coinbase to seize more market share internationally. Technology, as one would expect in such a domain, remains at the core of Coinbase's endeavors. By emphasizing scalable Layer 2 blockchain solutions, Coinbase is not only addressing the pressing needs of the present but is also laying robust foundations for the future. Such technological foresight is crucial in an industry marked by rapid advancements and equally swift obsolescence. The recent announcement of their Base product will enable them to help developers expand the overall business opportunities of crypto products while also granting them upside through these products being built on their scalable solution. The crypto realm, for all its dynamism, has often found itself at loggerheads with regulatory frameworks. Here too, Coinbase has chosen to be a long term trailblazer. Instead of a reactive stance, which is often the norm, the company has taken the bull by the horns. Through proactive engagements, grassroots campaigns, and strategic interventions like the ""Stand with Crypto"" initiative, Coinbase has transitioned from a mere participant to a key influencer in policy determinations. The company's role in the advancements of the crypto market structure Bill is indicative of its proactive and influential stance in the regulatory space. With the recent SEC troubles it is important to highlight that there are continued regulatory pressures and risks to Coinbase. While Coinbase is pushing to have the case dropped we believe that it is important to highlight that these risks are likely to remain until clear regulation is passed. Valuation Google In recent quarters, Coinbase has undergone a notable valuation adjustment. During the cryptocurrency boom, Coinbase was perceived as a high-growth company, and its valuation was primarily driven by revenue growth metrics. Long-term profitability took a backseat in favor of aggressive expansion. However, as market conditions became less favorable, there was a clear shift in Coinbase's strategy towards emphasizing profitability. This change in direction is evident in recent quarters, particularly with the reduction in operational expenses. Although Coinbase has yet to report a positive Operating Income, the reduction in its cash burn rate is commendable. Comparatively, just a year ago, the company was burning through $570 million each quarter. Seeking Alpha Although the cash flow of the business is garnering significant and well-deserved attention, we argue that the real potential lies in the customer deposits held on the platform. As illustrated in the provided data, customer assets on the platform saw an impressive surge of nearly $50 billion from Q4 2022 to Q2 2023. While some of this growth might be attributed to the challenges faced by competitors like Binance and FTX, we interpret this spike in deposits as a testament to the power and credibility of the Coinbase brand. Coinbase Although it's not entirely accurate to equate total assets with customer deposits directly, we contend that Coinbase's total assets can serve as a reasonable proxy for gauging customer deposits. Seeking Alpha Considering that September 2021 marked Coinbase's peak revenue quarter, the almost tenfold increase in deposits on the platform since then underscores a remarkable transformation in Coinbase's market stance. As Coinbase evolves into a comprehensive financial institution within the crypto sphere, it stands to benefit from broader ecosystem opportunities that a mere exchange platform couldn't offer with the biggest risk to their continued growth being either regulation or continued drops in interest in the crypto space. Using traditional Enterprise Valuation metrics Coinbase current sits at $16 Billion and has a TTM revenue of $2.5 Billion pricing them at roughly 6.4X Revenue/EV. Adding in their crypto holdings of ~$800 million brings the EV/Sales to ~6.0X. Which brings it in line with companies such as: ATVI :7.4X RBLX :5.9X U :7.5X CBOE : 4.5X While none of these offer a direct comparison it does highlight the valuation of COIN relative to the other in the tech space. While Coinbase doesn't offer a dramatic discount to others it does present a decent entry point for the crypto ecosystem if you are a believer in its long term success. Due to its lack of obvious discount we are placing a 'Buy' rating on it vs a 'Strong Buy.' Below we highlight some of our key levels of what we believe is fair pricing considering the current metrics. Key Levels for Coinbase (Author) Based off of these various levels we plan to initiate a few trades using options to reach some of these key levels. We believe that crypto and web3 is here to stay and that AI will help developers innovate and develop rapidly and that Coinbase's suite of options will enable even further development. In addition to this we have a long term bullish view for both BTC and ETH and that factors in to our opinion of Coinbase. We believe that profitability is near, especially as interest rates continue to climb. They are well capitalized and their midterm survival is not in doubt. They are definitely a high risk/high reward trade and we recommend selling options to take advantage of the high volatility. Conclusion In a domain characterized by volatility, both in terms of market prices and brand fortunes, Coinbase's journey stands out. Its blend of strategic initiatives, technological innovations, regulatory engagements, and a keen understanding of market dynamics make it a force to reckon with in the crypto world. As the contours of the digital currency landscape continue to evolve, Coinbase's role is becoming increasingly pivotal. It's not just a witness to the changing tides but is actively shaping the future of this vibrant ecosystem. It will be intriguing to see how this brand, with its clear vision and unwavering commitment, continues to mold the future of digital currencies and we believe in the long-term of Coinbase and place a rating of 'Buy' on them.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4637096-coinbase-shift-from-exchange-to-financial-powerhouse?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18043904.jpeg

Here’s What To Watch For,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has been ensnared in a prolonged period of stagnation, hinting at the ongoing battle between the bulls and bears for market control. This extended phase of inactivity has been persistent for over a month, signifying a short-term consolidation stage. Against the backdrop of a tumultuous cryptocurrency market, DOGE enthusiasts and investors are eagerly seeking cues for the coin’s next move. A meticulous examination of the daily chart in a price analysis unravels two distinctive patterns that have been shaping DOGE’s price trajectory. There is a range formation with defined limits at $0.068 and $0.056, anchoring the coin’s recent price movements. In addition, an ominous descending resistance trendline looms large, presenting an additional hurdle for DOGE’s potential ascent. Related Reading: XRP Forecast: Is A Retreat Below $0.5 Likely Before October? Bearish Dogecoin Impediments And Crucial Thresholds In light of the recent downturn in the broader crypto market, DOGE is currently grappling with formidable supply pressure around the $0.063 mark. The persistence of the descending trendline is emboldening sellers, increasing the likelihood of a retest of the enduring support at $0.059. Should this crucial level be breached, validated by a daily candle close, it could potentially intensify bearish sentiments, setting the stage for a 5.5% downturn toward the $0.056 level. However, amidst this challenging terrain, the $0.059 support level converges with an ascending trendline, generating a region of heightened significance. Should the buyers seize this juncture of market indecision, a successful breakthrough above the descending trendline could breathe fresh life into bullish sentiment. A confirmed breakout has the potential to usher in a rally, potentially propelling DOGE by an estimated 10%. DOGE market cap currently at $8.5 billion.

42419531,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEpzR,1695636780,How to Stake: 7 Strategies When Starting Out,"Is staking the new HODL? One recent analysis showed that 20% of all Ethereum is tied up in staking, and some ETH developers predict this could climb to 50%.  Whether the boom in staking is good or bad for the Ethereum ecosystem is a fair question, and one CoinDesk is exploring extensively in Staking Week, but it’s not the question we’re here for today.  This feature is part of Staking Week, presented by Foundry.  Instead, let’s acknowledge the basic fact that a lot of people -- regular old investors -- now care about staking, and presumably want to do it in a way that’s smart, savvy, and as safe as possible.  Maybe you want to put your crypto to work and make some extra money, especially as it languishes in the bear market. And maybe you know the basics of staking and why Ethereum switched to Proof of Stake (if not, here’s a fine primer), but you could use some guidance from the experts. As always, this is not financial advice and you should Do Your Own Research and floss your teeth and wear sunscreen, but here are some core principles to help you get started.  Spoiler alert: The secret sauce is something we rarely hear about in crypto: Boredom.  1. Think T-Bills  It’s easy to get distracted by the exotic staking possibilities -- obscure coins offering juicy rewards -- but the first and most important principle is to remember why you’re doing it in the first place, says Felix Lutsch, an advisor at staking company Chorus One. “Why you would stake on a personal level is mostly to avoid getting inflated by the new tokens that are minted,” says Lutsch. “It’s a bit like buying treasury bills.” With U.S. Treasury Bills, maybe you only earn a 3% yield but at least you’re (hopefully) outpacing inflation, and it’s better than keeping your cash in a near 0% savings account.  2. Watch out for incestuous collateral  Okay, it’s true that “incestuous collateral” is a phrase I just made up. But it seems like the best way to describe the twisted -- even dirty -- scenario where the collateral backing one asset class is the exact same as the asset it’s backing. Paweł Łaskarzewski, a DeFi expert and CEO of Nomad Fulcrum, uses the traditional finance example of “The Big Short” to explain the problem: In 2008, many of the banks’ sketchy mortgages were “backed” by warped versions of these same dodgy mortgages (often masked in a bundle), so when the mortgages failed it toppled the entire system.  “In the crypto world, the staking solutions are very often connected to some kind of over-collateralized lending protocols,” says Łaskarzewski. “We secure one crypto with another crypto, which means we use one class of asset to secure another asset of the same class.” Łaskarzewski says this kind of over-leverage is how we see “massive liquidations in crypto with billions lost by the users.”  3. Focus first on the underlying asset, not the staking  One of the biggest mistakes that rookie stakers make, says Lutsch, is to get so enamored with staking returns that they overlook the underlying project. “This is one of the core places where retail users lost a lot of money last year,” says Lutsch. The classic example is Terra, the failed stablecoin project. The project offered an alluring yield on USD, but “once you looked into it, you realize that it’s all based on the stability of the mechanism,” and that most people didn’t understand how the system worked, says Lutsch. Be suspicious of black boxes.  To minimize the risk of these kind of meltdowns, Lutsch recommends first investing in an actual project or token you believe in -- like Ethereum -- and then thinking of staking as the icing on top.  It’s a very boring thing, at some point. You’re just earning yield over time. There’s not much to it  4. Swim in the pool if you know the risks  Staking pools like Lido, Stakewise and Rocket Pool are “quite an innovative idea,” says Dr. Steve Berryman, CBO of Attestant (a staking company). Normally, on your own, you’d need 32 ETH to set up as a validator and stake directly. This requires tech-savvy, infrastructure, and its own set of risks. (What if you set it up wrong?)  With Rocket Pool, for example, you “only” need 8 ETH to become a node operator, as a clever system of smart contracts fills up the rest of the pool. (In other words, your 8 ETH are the anchor in a block of 32, and the other 24 are made of small chunks of ETH from randos.) As a de facto node operator -- without having to actually handle the physical infrastructure -- you earn rewards and can likely earn a higher return than vanilla staking on a platform like Coinbase.  You’ll also receive “liquid staking tokens” for the Ethereum you pledge to the network, such as stETH for Lido and rETH for Rocket Pool, which can be used on DeFi Applications. In theory this juices your returns and lets you do something useful with your ETH while they’re pledged to the network, but Berryman says that these pools do contain some sneaky extra risk, such as “slashing” (when your validator is slashed or penalized by the network because of some mistake) or the fact that collateral in Rocket Pool is held in RPL, so a plunge in RPL could leave you exposed. Given the extra risks and rewards, Berryman says strategy for bigger players is “is to put 10% into Rocket Pool [or Lido] because they like that bit of extra yield, and they understand the risks associated with it.”  5. Beware over-leverage  The phrase “yield farming” has somewhat gone out of fashion, but that’s essentially what you’re doing when you plunk USD in one staking protocol, then get liquidity tokens in return, and then you put those new tokens into another staking protocol, then get more liquidity tokens in return, ad infinitum. This is leverage. It can net you 5X the typical returns, says Łaskarzewski, but he warns that “once something goes wrong, you’re completely liquidated because you are over-leveraged.”  6. Vet the underlying project  Who’s on the leadership team? What’s their track record? Does the underlying project seem legitimate? “The main mistake people make is not thinking of the connection between the project and the yield,” says Lutsch. Especially in the number-go-up delirium of a bull market, the yield might look frothy and tempting, but then you later learn of glitches in the system or outright fraud. This is why Lutsch says it’s so crucial to vet the underlying asset, or as he puts it, “If you don’t trust the underlying project, don’t trust the yield.”  7. Embrace boredom  So much of crypto trading involves wild price fluctuations, jolts of adrenaline, and the feelings of elation or despair. Staking should be the opposite. If you are earning a steady (but relatively modest) yield on your capital and not thinking about it very often, good, then you’re doing it right. “It’s a very boring thing, at some point,” says Lutsch. “You’re just earning yield over time. There’s not much to it.”",NEUTRAL,ETH | RPL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RPL,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/25/how-to-stake-7-strategies-when-starting-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8adf2090f5be5515bb1e3d59f9ec02d5be48d03-1932x1087.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42419536,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEq5d,1695636757,The State of Staking: 5 Takeaways a Year After Ethereum's Merge,"It’s been a little over a year since Ethereum, the largest smart-contract blockchain, switched out its old energy intensive proof-of-work (PoW) model, used by blockchains like Bitcoin, for proof-of-stake (PoS).  The switch, known as the Merge, introduced “staking,” a new way to add and approve a block of transactions to the blockchain.  This feature is part of Staking Week, presented by Foundry.  Under PoW, miners would compete to add blocks by solving cryptographic puzzles. Now under PoS, Ethereum validators stake 32 ether (~$50,000) on the network, and they are randomly selected to add blocks. Under both models, miners and validators are rewarded some ETH if their block is added to the blockchain.  With staking, Ethereum drastically cut the blockchain’s environmental impact, but it continues to face a slew of challenges around centralized power, censorship, and exploitation from certain infrastructure intermediaries. Here are five takeaways that the Ethereum ecosystem has learned over the last year since the Merge:  Ethereum’s energy consumption has fallen 99.9%  Ethereum’s Merge overhauled the network’s consensus mechanism – the system that a “decentralized” community of network operators use to secure the network and process transactions. The old model, “proof-of-work,” operated using a power-hungry “mining” system, where network operators essentially competed to process blocks (and earn rewards) by expending compute power.  The shift away from crypto mining to staking was expected to drastically reduce Ethereum’s energy consumption – completely retiring the energy-intensive system that the network previously used to produce blocks and secure users.  Ethereum’s energy footprint pre-Merge was around the size of a small country, and the statistics around its energy usage were a main point of contention for critics of early NFTs and DeFi. Bitcoin, which still uses a proof-of-work system to power its network, continues to consume the same amount of energy as Singapore, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.  Ethereum’s new emission numbers have dropped drastically  A year on from the Merge, and Ethereum’s new emission numbers have dropped drastically. Ethereum’s new proof-of-stake system consumes 99.9% less energy than its old mining-based system. Whatever the other successes – or failures – of the upgrade, it is now much harder to paint Etheruem as harmful to the environment.  Stake distribution raises centralization questions  In addition to facing criticism for its high energy costs, Ethereum’s old consensus model came under fire for concentrating power into the hands of a small cadre of crypto mining syndicates – entities that had the money, specialized hardware and know-how to build massive crypto-mining facilities. Before the merge, just three mining pools dominated a majority Ethereum’s hashrate – a measure of the collective computing power of all miners  When the Merge transitioned Ethereum to PoS, the network abandoned mining in favor of staking. The new system stripped away the hardware requirements and compute costs of PoW, in part as a way to open the door for more people to pitch in to operate the network..  A year on from the Merge, however, centralization remains one of Ethereum’s biggest challenges. To stake on Ethereum, a validator needs to lock up 32 ETH, or roughly $50,000 with the network – funds that earn a steady stream of interest, but can be revoked if a validator errs or acts dishonestly. Setting up a validator node to stake on the network can also be a complicated task, meaning financial penalties can result if things are set up improperly.  Because of the expense and technical barriers to setting up a node, intermediary services arose – from companies like Coinbase and “decentralized” collectives like Lido – allowing users to pool their ETH together to create 32 ETH for a node. These intermediary entities do most of the heavy lifting: they take ETH from users, stake it on their behalf, and take a cut of the rewards that they earn from operating a validator.  Even before the Merge, some anti-PoS advocates feared staking could increase Ethereum’s centralization – meaning a small number of these intermediaries (or even a single one) might gain disproportionate control over which blocks are added to the network.  That scenario seems to be playing out: currently, the largest staking provider is Lido, the biggest decentralized staking pool. Lido currently accounts for 32.3% of the total share of staked ETH, leading to concerns of centralization as it nears the 33% mark, a threshold that developers say could cause security problems.  MEV and censorship  After the Merge, Ethereum’s validators have managed to net significant extra profits via a practice called maximal extractable value (MEV). This is sometimes seen as an “invisible tax” that validators and builders can collect from users by strategically inserting or reordering transactions before they’re added to the network.  When MEV became an unexpected vector of centralization and censorship on the network, third-parties stepped in to try and address some of the practice’s more pernicious side-effects.  Flashbots, an Ethereum research and development firm, invented MEV-boost, a piece of software that validators can run to reduce negative side-effects of MEV. Flashbots’ solution to the MEV problem is a controversial one, however. While some think MEV should be eradicated altogether, Flashbots’ introduced MEV-Boost to make the practice ubiquitous.  Currently, about 90% blocks on Ethereum go through MEV-Boost, which optimizes how transactions are organized into blocks in order to extract the maximum profit for validators.  The popularity of MEV-boost has become a point of contention for the network. As mentioned, MEV is viewed by some as an unfair tax on users. Flashbots’ central role in Ethereum’s MEV market has come under fire: most blocks assembled via Flashbots’ software are “relayed” – or delivered to validators – via Flashbots itself.  This kind of centralization has been viewed by some as a potential vector for censorship: when the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned some Ethereum addresses associated with Tornado Cash, a mixer program, Flashbots stopped adding those transactions to the blocks it sends to the validator. This move was anathema to Ethereum builders who think that the infrastructure level occupied by Flashbots should be completely neutral – lest the entire network become more similar to centralized payment processors like Visa.  Since the early days of the Merge, the Ethereum community has made efforts to reduce censorship by configuring MEV-Boost to use non-Flashbots relays. Currently, 17.3% of blocks rely on Flashbots’ relay to extract MEV, and censorship is down to 35%, a tremendous reversal compared to its highpoint of 78% in November 2022.  Liquid staking tokens have taken over the ETH market  Following the Merge, the emergence of liquid staking has risen in the Ethereum ecosystem.  Anyone can earn rewards and participate in Ethereum’s security system via the process of staking, which involves locking up ETH tokens in an address on the Ethereum blockchain in exchange for a steady stream of interest. But there’s one problem: Once tokens are staked, they can’t be bought, sold, or used in DeFi (eg. as collateral for loans) — limiting staking’s appeal for investors interested in maximizing the value they earn from their investments.  Liquid staking services from third-parties present an alternative to traditional staking. Users who stake through services like Lido — rather than stake directly with Ethereum — earn a kind of derivative ETH token representing their staked assets: liquid staking tokens, or “LSTs” for short.  LSTs earn interest just like regular staked ETH, but they can be bought and sold like any other crypto — which makes them an extremely appealing investment for DeFi traders who want easy exposure to ETH staking. As an added bonus, LSTs offer users exposure to staking without the requirement that they put up 32 ETH, the minimum required for staking oneself.  Staked ETH was impossible for stakers to withdraw before the Shapella upgrade in April 2023, so people initially turned to liquid staking to earn staking yields without the risk of locking up tokens for an unknown amount of time. Once it became possible to withdraw staked ETH — removing one of the key risks of staking, but eroding one of the value-adds of LSTs — some thought the liquid staking market might shrink in favor of conventional staking. That’s not what happened.  Macroeconomic factors have probably had the larger impact than supply changes in the near-term  Currently, the liquid staking market is worth almost $20 billion, and it is growing rapidly — largely due to the ubiquity of LSTs in DeFi and the accessibility of LSTs compared to conventional staking. Lido’s token, stETH, represents the largest share in the LST market, with about 72.24% of the total share of LSTs.  Net supply of ETH is down  The Merge update came with some tweaks to ether’s tokenomics – the rules underpinning the blockchain’s native token.  Most notably, the upgrade made ETH “deflationary” for the first time, meaning that the overall supply of the token is now decreasing rather than increasing. The circulating supply of ETH today is .24% lower than it was a year ago. The decrease in supply stemmed in part from EIP-1559, a network upgrade that preceded the Merge by about a year. That upgrade began “burning” some ETH with every transaction on the network, but ETH didn’t become net-deflationary until the Merge made additional cuts to the rate at which new ETH is issued.  When ETH’s supply was growing year over year, some investors fear their share of tokens will become devalued over time. Some hoped that deflation would help make ETH more valuable. So far, it’s hard to say whether that’s happened. Ether’s price hasn’t changed much in the months since the Merge, and macroeconomic factors have probably had the larger impact than supply changes in the near-term.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,"Margaux Nijkerk, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/09/25/the-state-of-staking-5-takeaways-a-year-after-ethereums-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0a664a91664f590f30e4cda1c45ff20fc3d8182-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419522,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEpp7,1695636000,Sam Bankman-Fried (Probably) Won’t Get a 115-Year Prison Sentence,"If he’s convicted of wire fraud and/or conspiracy charges, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried will probably spend quite a bit of time behind bars. But there’s a good chance the 31-year-old won’t spend the rest of his life in prison.  Bankman-Fried’s trial tied to the operation and collapse of FTX and its affiliated hedge fund, Alameda Research, kicks off next week. Prosecutors will have to prove that he knowingly lied to his customers or lenders, knew it was wrong, was trying to defraud them, or knowingly worked with at least one other person to try and defraud lenders, customers or investors.  Latest News: Sam Bankman-Fried Guilty on All 7 Counts in FTX Fraud Trial  The burden of proof rests on the prosecution’s shoulders. The defense team, in contrast, only has to convince a jury that the U.S. Department of Justice didn’t successfully make its case that Bankman-Fried violated the law.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Charges against Sam Bankman-Fried  The charges themselves are:  committing wire fraud on FTX customers  conspiring to commit wire fraud on FTX customers  committing wire fraud on Alameda Research lenders  conspiring to commit wire fraud on Alameda Research lenders  conspiring to commit securities fraud against FTX investors  conspiring to commit [commodities?] fraud against FTX customers  conspiring to commit money laundering to hide the proceeds of wire fraud on FTX customers  Substantive versus conspiracy  Of these, only charges one and three – wire fraud on FTX customers and Alameda Research lenders – are “substantive” charges, meaning the Department of Justice is alleging that Bankman-Fried himself actively committed the crimes.  The remaining five are “conspiracy” charges, meaning prosecutors allege he planned to commit a crime with at least one other person. The DOJ, in its proposed jury instructions, asked Judge Lewis Kaplan to clarify that “there is no need to prove that the crime or crimes … actually were committed,” with conspiracy charges, unlike the substantive charges.  Martin Auerbach, an attorney with law firm Withersworldwide, told CoinDesk that for the conspiracy charges, the DOJ will have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least two people “agreed that they’re going to defraud people,” and overtly acted to do so.  Sending out emails or otherwise trying to (allegedly) defraud people through some online tool meets the interstate requirement for the wire fraud charge, he said.  For the substantive charges, the DOJ will have to prove that Bankman-Fried actually committed the crime, Auerbach said.  Making a case  The fraud-related charges are relatively similar, Jordan Estes, a partner at Kramer Levin, told CoinDesk. They all involve Bankman-Fried allegedly lying to customers or lenders. The DOJ will likely try to simplify the case as much as possible for the jury to focus on the lies and deceit they’re claiming he engaged in.  Part of this is intent, Estes said. If Bankman-Fried’s defense team can prove he didn’t intend to try and commit fraud, he may be found not guilty of the charges arrayed against him.  The defense’s job is to argue that the DOJ did not make its case. With an advice-of-counsel defense, which Bankman-Fried’s attorneys have said they'll make, the argument may be that the FTX founder ran his actions by his lawyers while at the exchange, and they okayed them.  “It really goes to the intent of the defendant, because one of the things the government has to prove is that he intended to defraud, that he intended to do something wrongful,” Estes said. “And he may be able to show that he had lawyers that were helping him at every step of the way, and ask the jury to infer that based on that … that he had every reason to believe he was not doing anything wrong.”  To do this, the defense team may try and attack the credibility of the DOJ’s witnesses or the evidence, Auerbach said. For example, they may say that some of the cooperating witnesses – meaning members of the FTX inner circle – are testifying on the DOJ’s behalf and using the DOJ’s characterization because they run the risk of going to jail themselves otherwise.  Prosecutors may also have to show that Bankman-Fried either didn’t provide his lawyers with all of the material information they needed to advise him properly to push back against the advice-of-counsel defense.  Defense attorneys also hope to bring on certain expert witnesses to rebut testimony. While the judge rejected all of the proposed defense witnesses, the defense can still try to call some up provided they meet certain requirements, a ruling Estes said was appropriate. It would be difficult for these proposed witnesses to know what, specifically, they need to discuss before they see what they are rebutting.  As CoinDesk previously noted, a verdict on each of the charges needs to be unanimous. Every member of the jury will need to believe that Bankman-Fried did or did not commit each of the seven crimes he’s accused of.  If a jury comes back and says they are divided on any of the counts, the judge can send them back with instructions to try again. If the jury keeps coming back, the judge can say the jury hanged on that charge.  The DOJ could retry Bankman-Fried on any hung charges, Estes said. Prosecutors can’t bring back any charges that he is acquitted of, however, though the defense can appeal any guilty verdicts.  115 years in jail for Sam Bankman-Fried?  The DOJ noted that under federal sentencing guidelines, convictions under the wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy charges each carry a 20-year maximum prison sentence, while the commodities fraud, securities fraud and campaign finance conspiracy charges each carry a maximum five-year sentence. Totaled, the original eight charges Bankman-Fried faced (one was later dropped) carried a total sentence of 115 years.  Though there's headlines suggesting Bankman-Fried could spend over 100 or 150 years in prison, in reality, he will likely spend nowhere near that much time behind bars should he be convicted. For one thing, even if there's multiple convictions, the sentences are more likely to be concurrent than consecutive.  Similar charges are grouped, Estes said.  “When a judge is sentencing a defendant in a multi-count case, assuming conviction on multiple counts, judges generally say ‘I’m going to distill this down to what the alleged crime is,’” Auerbach said. “If the essential crime is, let’s assume a conviction that Bankman-Fried misled his investors, his lenders and his customers, basically those are all variations on the same theme, so [the judge will] sentence for that core wrongful conduct.”  There's no mandatory minimum, Estes said. Given the nature of the charges, there may still be a large sentence though. Under federal sentencing guidelines, the dollar amount of losses and other details could lead to enhancements, which would add to the potential sentence.  Before the judge gets to sentencing, the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System will create a recommendation. They may look at the trial transcript and Bankman-Fried’s background, and may potentially interview Bankman-Fried himself.  That recommendation will go to the judge, and the defense and prosecution will each provide their own recommendations.  Several lawyers CoinDesk spoke to said that Bankman-Fried – if convicted – could spend 10 to 20 years or so in prison, given the severity of the crimes and the estimated losses. Of course, Judge Kaplan has broad discretion, and he will ultimately set the final sentence.  “At bottom, [fraud cases] – even if they involve cryptocurrency or these complicated things – they can be really simple. They can be about ‘did he lie to these people, investors, lenders, customers? And when he did, did he think it was wrong?’” Estes said. “I think there's a way to simplify it … both for the prosecution and the defense, and that’s ultimately what the case will come down to. And it’s interesting that even as we move to complicated assets and all these novel things in the financial industry, the heart of a fraud case is actually pretty similar.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/25/sam-bankman-fried-probably-wont-get-a-115-year-prison-sentence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419533,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEq1V,1695635557,Crypto Traders Brace for Nearly $5B Bitcoin and Ether Options Expiry,"On Friday, 117,000 BTC options contracts and 1.1 million ETH options contracts will expire on Deribit.  Max pain levels for BTC and ETH are $26,500 and $1,650, respectively.  Traders expect prices to remain stable ahead of the expiry.  On Friday at 08:00 UTC, a total of 1.217 million bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) options contracts with a notional value of $4.8 billion will expire on leading crypto options exchange Deribit.  Roughly 10% or 117,000 contracts out of the total are tied to bitcoin, while the rest are ether options. On Deribit, one options contract represents one BTC and one ETH. Options are derivatives that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying at a pre-determined price at a later date.  These derivatives contracts will be valuable or worthless depending on how the top two cryptocurrencies trade by the end of the week.  Both seasoned traders and retail investors track monthly and quarterly options expiries, given their propensity to influence markets ahead of and following the settlement.  ""Quarterly expiries are typically the most significant in terms of volume and value. For instance, last June witnessed expiries totaling $5.4 billion, while March saw $5.2 billion. The current quarter is consistent with the preceding ones in 2023,"" Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk.  ""This September, $3 billion in BTC options and $1.8 billion in ETH options will expire, with the Max Pain level close to current price levels,"" Strijers added.  The max pain for bitcoin and ether September expiry options is $26,500 and $1,650. At press time, bitcoin and ether changed hands at $26,100 and $1,580.  Max pain is the level where options buyers stand to lose most money on expiration. The theory is that writers or sellers of options look to keep prices pinned near the max pain point while heading into the expiry to inflict maximum pain on buyers. They do so by purchasing and selling the underlying asset in the spot/futures markets.  Another feature that makes quarterly settlements important is the hedging activities of market makers or entities tasked with creating liquidity in an order book.  Market makers looking to hedge their gamma exposure and maintain a market-neutral book by actively buying and selling the underlying asset as expiry nears. Gamma refers to the rate of change of delta or sensitivity of an option's price to the changes in the underlying asset's price.  When market makers' gamma exposure is net positive, they ""buy low and sell high"" in the spot market, arresting price volatility. On the other hand, they buy high and sell low, amplifying price moves when their net gamma exposure is negative.  Strijers doesn't foresee a volatility explosion while heading into the event.  ""In the past month, we have seen stable markets whilst the Gamma of the September expiries has increased gradually as a function of time. The impact of an uneven distribution of Gamma amongst traders would have resulted in much more volatility as compared to what we have seen these days. Therefore, we don't anticipate strong market moves in the coming week,"" Strijers said.  According to Options Insights founder Imran Lakha, ether dealers predominantly hold long gamma positions near $1,650-$1,700, which means these levels could act as glue ahead of the expiry.  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said the same is the case with bitcoin.  ""The possibility of price stabilization is very high. The option expiring on Sep. 29 has a very significant positive gamma. As the expiration date approaches, the gamma will become larger and larger, thus exerting a powerful attraction on the price,"" Ardern said.  ""Friday’s quarterly settlement price is more likely to be near the peak gamma exposure levels, which are $26,000-$27,000 for BTC, and $1,500 or $1,650 for ETH,"" Ardern added.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/25/crypto-traders-brace-for-nearly-5b-bitcoin-and-ether-options-expiry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aac40eeab200c68cb7681be87c371160521e18c0-1280x640.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18042519,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552730,1695634216,"Will Bitcoin Drop To $20,000? EURUSD Correlation Indicates It Might","In recent discussions surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) and its potential future price trajectory, crypto-enthusiasts and analysts alike are finding new correlations to dissect. Most notably, a correlation with the EURUSD pair (the euro against the US dollar) has come into the spotlight due to a Twitter thread by esteemed analyst Josh Olszewicz. Olszewicz begins by setting the stage, drawing attention to the widely acknowledged inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the DXY (US Dollar Index). He notes, “Most are aware of the strong historic BTC-DXY inverse correlation. DXY is a USD index against a basket of currencies which has a EURUSD weighting of around 58%. So the BTC-EURUSD correlation should also be relatively high.” Will Bitcoin Price Follow EURUSD? What’s intriguing here is the observation Olszewicz makes about the BTC-EURUSD correlation in the period following the pandemic and the last Bitcoin halving. He mentions that the “post-pandemic (post-halving) EURUSD pair has led BTC in both the bullish and bearish direction by anywhere from a month to a full year.” This pattern, if it continues to persist, might spell some bearish tendencies for Bitcoin. Olszewicz goes on to suggest that, “If this relationship continues to hold, BTC should break down towards the BTFP low of $20k.” This statement is a significant one, indicating a potential substantial drop from its current position, all based on the movement patterns of the EURUSD. Related Reading: New Bitcoin Prediction: Analyst Backs BTC To Reach $34,500 In 2024 Further supporting this projection, he highlights a technical pattern observed in both BTC and EURUSD, stating, “the EURUSD has completed a bearish H&S, similar to BTC, providing technical fuel for further downside.” A ‘bearish H&S’ refers to the bearish ‘head and shoulders’ pattern, a chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. However, it’s not all gloom and doom. Olszewicz does provide a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin bulls. He posits, “If you’re bullish on BTC here, you’re either hoping this relationship weakens/breaks, or the EURUSD begins to strengthen instead of continuing to weaken.” BTC’s Second High Does Not Fit Olszewicz also touches upon some “tin foil” speculations, discussing how the BTC-EURUSD correlation had been seemingly disrupted during Bitcoin’s second high in November 2022. He suggests that the continued fall of EURUSD did not immediately impact Bitcoin’s bullish trend, speculating that actions from major crypto players like 3AC, FTX/Alameda, and the Anchor BTC reserve might have played a role. Related Reading: Coinbase Holds $25 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin, Becomes Largest Holder With 1M BTC He states, “It is both possible and likely that the funny business behind the scenes by 3AC & FTX/Alameda, as well as the Anchor BTC reserve, helped delay the inevitable bearish trend by about a year.” While correlations can provide insight, they are by no means a guarantee of future market movements. Investors should exercise caution and conduct their own research when making investment decisions. Rose Premium Signals added, “interesting observation about the BTC-EURUSD correlation. It’s essential to consider multiple factors in crypto analysis. The relationship could indeed evolve, impacting BTC’s future movements.” At press time, BTC stood at $26,180.

42419532,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEq0T,1695632539,Terra Classic Community Votes to Stop USTC Minting as Revival Efforts Continue,"The Terra Classic protocol will no longer mint terraUSD (USTC), the infamous token that slumped 99% amid the implosion of the once high-flying Terra protocol in 2022.  A community vote on Terra Classic’s governance forum that ended last week won 59% approval to stop all USTC minting. The current value of USTC is 1 cent as of Monday afternoon.  Terra Classic is the original network created by Terraform Labs. It has continued as an independent blockchain rather than Terra 2.0, which is a forked version that was created in the wake of Terra's collapse.  TerraUSD was the token at the center of Terra’s collapse and led to a 99.9% drop in LUNA token prices, $28 billion being hemorrhage from Terra-based DeFi applications and an eventual spiral to crypto funds going bust.  Community members say the move could help protect users and outside investors who are burning USTC to help to achieve the repeg. Burning refers to the permanent deletion of tokens from circulation by sending them to an address that’s not controlled by anyone.  Algorithmic stablecoins like USTC are backed by a basket of assets, such as LUNA and bitcoin (BTC), without depending on any centralized third party to hold those assets. Most of the tokens, however, fall victim to a “death spiral” – with outflows or sales of backing assets causing a sudden de-pegging of USTC-like projects.  The USTC was intended to be pegged at $1 by this mechanism, and members hoped that burning tokens could eventually let USTC meet that goal. This, however, could require the trillions of tokens to be burned.  “Any form of minting or reminting goes completely against any community effort,” the proposal read. “Most importantly, this proposal opens the door for institutions like Binance to start burning USTC knowing that the minting and reminting is over.”  Such proposals and moves are part of a small set of engineers hoping to return Terra to its glory days.  A group calling itself the “Samurai Six” is actively working toward creating applications built on Terra Classic and rewards for developers working on the network, as CoinDesk previously reported.  These efforts aim to eventually drive value to the Terra Classic ecosystem, and, hopefully, an increase in LUNC value over time.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LUNC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LUNC | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/09/25/terra-classic-community-votes-to-stop-ustc-minting-as-revival-efforts-continue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bcd05ef7e284a330350e372c9195e3d4873cff4-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18040973,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=552725,1695630650,Is Terra Classic Planning For USTC To Be Pegged To The Dollar Again?,"The Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) community has voted overwhelmingly, with nearly 60% in favor, to cease the minting and reminting of Terra Classic UST (USTC) tokens. The drastic decision, in a decisive move aimed at rescuing the beleaguered Terra Classic stablecoin, comes in the wake of Terra’s collapse in May 2022, which had sent shockwaves through the crypto market, leaving USTC’s value in shambles. The proposal to halt USTC minting and reminting is part of a comprehensive plan to facilitate the re-pegging process of the stablecoin. To accelerate this process, members of the Terra Classic community are actively encouraged to participate in the burning of USTC tokens, effectively reducing the token’s circulating supply. Related Reading: XRP Forecast: Is A Retreat Below $0.5 Likely Before October? Before the catastrophic events of May 2022, Terra’s blockchain network allowed users to seamlessly swap between USTC and LUNA, Terra’s native cryptocurrency. However, as the network crumbled and USTC lost its peg to the US dollar, the system began minting LUNA coins in a desperate attempt to restore stability. This emergency measure led to an oversupply of LUNA tokens and a cascading effect on its price, dragging USTC’s value far below its intended $1 mark. The Yes votes have it. Source: Atom.Scan Terra Luna Burning Challenge The community’s primary objective with this proposal is to expedite the burning of LUNA tokens, ultimately driving up their value. The burning process, where tokens are permanently removed from circulation, has been sluggish so far, with only 75 billion LUNC tokens successfully incinerated. This leaves the circulating supply at approximately 5.9 trillion LUNC, out of a total supply of 6.84 trillion. As more LUNA tokens were minted to restore the USTC peg, the oversupply put immense downward pressure on LUNA’s price. Consequently, USTC’s value suffered a steep decline from its initial $1 valuation. LUNC/USDT trading at $0.000060 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Accumulation Signals Amidst Uncertainty Despite the tumultuous journey thus far, there are positive indicators that offer a glimmer of hope for the Terra Luna Classic community. According to CoinGecko, the current price of LUNC stands at $0.00006150, reflecting a 2.9% increase in the past 24 hours and a promising 6.6% surge over the past seven days. Key momentum indicators observed within a 24-hour window show signs of approaching overbought levels. LUNC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53, indicating moderate strength, while its Money Flow Index (MFI) is at 76, suggesting robust accumulation. This shift in sentiment indicates that the community’s efforts to restore value may be gaining traction. LUNC price action in the last seven days. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: ImmutableX Makes Noise As IMX Dominates Top 50 Roster With 33% Climb The Terra Luna Classic community’s bold decision to halt USTC minting and reminting signifies a concerted effort to revitalize the ailing stablecoin. With a renewed focus on burning LUNA tokens and correcting the supply-demand imbalance, the community aims to steer USTC back on course towards its $1 peg, providing a glimmer of hope amidst a challenging journey of redemption.

The industry’s oldest asset saw a tepid weekend marked by price stability and low volumes, nearing the $26,000 level, losing 1.7% in the past 24 hours.  Major tokens such as XRP and dogecoin (DOGE) led declines, with drops of 4% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) fell 0.9%, outperforming the general market, as the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based tracker of hundreds of tokens, slumped 1.1%.  Aptos's APT, Chainlink’s LINK and gaming platform ImmutableX’s IMX were the only tokens in the green, rising as much as 6% on various growth – and fake – catalysts.  Analysts at trading firm FxPro told CoinDesk in a note they remain bearish for the next few weeks, expecting prices to reach as low as $23,000 amid the general lack of interest in trading riskier assets and the absence of market-moving catalysts.  However, there’s still hope for bulls. On-chain data platform CryptoQuant published in a weekly note that bitcoin's recent price performance closely resembled past cycles, suggesting that the asset was “likely to remain in a consolidation phase until the 2024 halving event” but hinted at a “significant price increase after the halving.”  “This assessment is supported by various long-term valuation metrics, including logarithmic growth curves,” analysts at CryptoQuant wrote. “There’s also the realized cap of short-term user transactions (UTXOs), which indicates under-valuation and the absence of widespread retail speculation, reinforcing the potential for future price growth.”  Bitcoin prices have historically boomed after its halving, a term when block rewards are slashed in half in typically four-year cycles.

However, many might not be conversant with the challenges the network encounters. In a recent interview, Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, revealed the biggest of them all. Ethereum’s Biggest Challenge Speaking with CNBC, Buterin mentioned that the biggest challenge that the “Ethereum ecosystem” faces is ensuring that it builds products that provide value to its users. According to him, the last decade was test-running, but now Ethereum needs to provide utility. Ethereum is known to host some of the biggest decentralized applications (dApps), including prominent decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, Curve Finance, and Sushiswap. The network has also grown massively to the extent that several Ethereum layer-2 networks have sprung up in a bid to scale the network. Related Reading: Bitwise Withdraws Application, A Big Blow To Ethereum ETFs? Despite this, it seems that Buterin believes that there is more to be done, even as Ethereum has asserted itself as the go-to network for dApps and other decentralized solutions. Meanwhile, ETH, its native token, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Buterin also spoke about how cryptocurrencies enjoy greater use in less-developed countries as people use crypto tokens to make payments and for savings. Cryptocurrencies have long been touted as a hedge against inflation, and it would seem that crypto is being put to use where it is needed most. A recent report by Chainalysis showed that the highest-ranked countries for crypto adoption are being plagued with a devaluing fiat currency. The Ethereum founder also stated that centralized entities like Binance need to take a back seat for crypto adoption to move forward. While he appreciates these entities’ role in growing the crypto industry, he believes crypto needs to become more decentralized. His reason for saying this isn’t far-fetched as he noted that these entities are vulnerable to “both pressure from the outside and to themselves being corrupted.” Truly, centralized entities have taken many hits this past year, which has had far-reaching consequences on the industry. Last year, one of the biggest crypto exchanges, FTX, collapsed, which had several ripple effects on the crypto industry and market. Meanwhile, the two largest crypto exchanges by trading volume, Binance, and Coinbase, are currently embroiled in legal battles against the SEC. ETH price sits at $1,578 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com The Future Of Ethereum Last year, Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake following the Merge. Buterin stated this move has made the network more decentralized as it is “harder to shut down” than a proof-of-work network. He also banished the idea that the network was heavily reliant on him, which many had identified as a weakness as the government could easily go after him to clamp down on the network. Related Reading: What The Drop In Spot And Derivatives Volumes Means For The Price Of Bitcoin According to him, Ethereum has grown to become independent of him and the Ethereum Foundation. He points out how several independent applications on the blockchain have taken the workload off him and made the network more autonomous. As to Ethereum’s future plans and projects, he said that the network is focused on privacy and scaling with the help of zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups. ZK rollups are layer-2 scaling solutions that help scale the Ethereum network by moving computation off-chain, thereby reducing the computing workload on the network. It also promotes privacy, as one can verify transactions without knowing what it is about.

42419538,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEq4b,1695623959,Bitcoin and S&P 500 Eye Quarterly Loss as Bonds Look Most Attractive Since 2009,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Wall Street's benchmark equity index, the S&P 500, appear on track to end the third quarter lower as a key metric shows the case for owning bonds over stocks and risk assets in general, is strongest since 2009.  The top cryptocurrency by market value traded at $26,100, representing a 14% decline for the third quarter, assuming losses hold through Sept. 30. At Friday's close of $4,320.05, the S&P 500, the benchmark for risk assets worldwide, including cryptocurrencies, was down nearly 3% for the third quarter.  The equity risk premium, the gap between the S&P 500’s earnings yield and the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, has declined to -0.58, the lowest since 2009, according to charting platform TradingView. The spread has averaged roughly 3.5 points since 2008.  In other words, the allure of investing in stocks and other risk assets has dimmed with safe-haven government bonds offering a relatively higher return. Treasury securities are regarded as risk free, given they are backed by the United States government, which has never defaulted on its debts. The 10-year yield, therefore, is considered a benchmark risk-free rate of return against which other returns from other assets are compared.  The difference between the S&P 500's dividend yield and the 10-year Treasury yield paints a similar picture. The spread has declined to -2.87, the lowest since July 2007.  Juicy bond yields also mean less incentive to invest in bitcoin. Crypto propounders consider bitcoin a haven asset like digital gold, although historically, the cryptocurrency has been a pure play on liquidity, often acting as a lead indicator to stocks.  ""Bitcoin is a non-yield bearing, risk-on asset. As such, it will be adversely affected by a high USD risk-free rate due to portfolio rebalancing,"" Alex McFarlane, co-founder of Keyring Network, said on LinkedIn.  ""The suggestion that we can go forward ignoring rates markets and trade BTC as an orthogonal portfolio component doesn’t square unless BTC can offer a risk-free rate - which it cannot, unlike POS [Proof-of-stake],"" McFarlane added.
