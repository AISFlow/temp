Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37941619,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631748,1734823374,Peter Schiff’s FOMO: Why he wants USA coin instead of Bitcoin,"Peter Schiff, a harsh critic of Bitcoin, has proposed a government-backed digital currency, “USA Coin.” This shift suggests he’s reconsidering his stance on cryptocurrency, favoring centralized control. His proposal reflects how digital currencies are gaining more acceptance, even from skeptics and critics. For years, Peter Schiff, vocal Bitcoin critic. He has repeatedly argued that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, generates no income, and is driven purely by speculation. Even called it as “Bubble.” Schiff’s shift on proposing USA coin Yet, there is a twist, Schiff has recently proposed the creation of a government-backed digital currency called “USA Coin,” instead of Bitcoin Reserve, which is similar to Bitcoin in many ways. Could this sudden shift in his perspective reveal contradictions in long-standing criticism and indicate a selective acceptance of cryptocurrency principles? Schiff has always been an opponent of Bitcoin, emphasizing its limitations as an asset. According to him, Bitcoin is inability to generate income makes it inferior to traditional assets like real estate, which produce rents that can cover debt payments. He has also dismissed Bitcoin as a store of value, arguing that its price surges are driven by hype and FOMO (fear of missing out) rather than fundamental stability, even after it reached $100,000. Schiff criticized the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposed by some U.S. policymakers and Senator Cynthia Lummis being a part. Especially, the idea of using Bitcoin as a reserve to clear the national debt. Schiff argued that this move would destabilize the U.S. economy and weaken the dollar, warning that government involvement in Bitcoin could lead to hyperinflation. From Bitcoin critic to advocate of centralized digital currency Despite his opposition to Bitcoin, Schiff has now proposed the creation of a government-backed digital currency called “USA Coin.” According to him, the coin could have a capped supply of 21 million as same as Bitcoin, but with an upgraded blockchain to make it viable for everyday payments. So, that could make all rich. This proposal seems to reflect Schiff’s partial acceptance of cryptocurrency concepts while rejecting Bitcoin’s decentralized nature. Ultimately Schiff’e idea of USA Coin opposes Bitcoin’s core principle: decentralization. By proposing USA coin, the U.S. government create and control the currency, So, he favors centralized authority and security over Bitcoin’s trustless and decentralized system. Schiff’s proposal questions his real motives. For years, he called Bitcoin a risky bubble driven by influencers and early investors trying to get rich quickly. But, by suggesting a USA Coin, he’s indirectly admitting that digital currencies have value and potential. His problem with Bitcoin’s decentralization seems less about the technology and more about wanting government control. This change shows Schiff may not fully reject digital currencies but dislikes Bitcoin’s lack of rules and central authority. His idea for a government-backed cryptocurrency shows he thinks digital assets need support from a trusted source to be safe and reliable. If Bitcoin became centralized or controlled by the government, would critics like Schiff support it? This reminds of many current adopters and influencers were once a big skeptic and critic, right from the President -elect Trump. Schiff often criticizes Bitcoin because it operates outside traditional banks and government control. Yet, his idea for a USA Coin shows he might accept cryptocurrency if it fits his preference for centralized authority. By suggesting a government-backed digital currency, Schiff seems interested in being part of the growing world of digital assets. Schiff’s mixed views show a bigger debate in finance about cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin supporters see its decentralized model as a way to give people more power and rely less on traditional systems. But critics like Schiff think government support is needed for trust and stability. His idea for a USA Coin also shows how digital currencies are becoming more accepted, even by sceptics. It shows how Bitcoin’s growth has made critics rethink their views, even if they don’t fully agree with it. Peter Schiff’s proposal for a USA Coin shows a shift in his views on cryptocurrency. While he still criticizes Bitcoin’s decentralization, he supports a government-backed alternative, hinting at his preference for control. His evolving stance reflects the growing influence of digital currencies, even among critics.

But for many investors, it became a story of missed opportunities, as its value soared beyond reach. If you’re still regretting missing out on ICP, don’t worry— Qubetics is here, and it’s shaping up to be the next big thing in blockchain technology. With its innovative solutions like the non-custodial wallet, Qubetics is addressing key challenges in the crypto world while offering investors a chance to get in early. With analysts predicting $10–$15 for $TICS post-mainnet launch, now might be the time to make your move. The Evolution of Blockchain: From ICP to Qubetics ICP captured the market’s attention with its promise of decentralised internet services, but it wasn’t without its limitations. As blockchain technology evolves, new projects are emerging to build on ICP’s foundation while solving its shortcomings. Enter Qubetics—a platform designed to offer unmatched usability, security, and scalability in the blockchain ecosystem. ICP’s groundbreaking idea of decentralised web services paved the way for Qubetics. However, ICP’s rapid growth highlighted significant challenges, including scalability and ease of use for everyday applications. Qubetics builds on these lessons, delivering a blockchain platform that is accessible, secure, and ready for mass adoption. Qubetics introduces tools like its non-custodial wallet to simplify blockchain interactions for users and developers. Unlike traditional wallets that require third-party oversight, the Qubetics wallet empowers users to maintain full control over their assets. This innovation aligns perfectly with the blockchain ethos of decentralisation and trustless systems, making Qubetics an attractive option for both investors and developers. Why Qubetics Stands Out The blockchain market is competitive, but Qubetics is setting itself apart with its forward-thinking technology and community-driven approach. Blockchain adoption has faced hurdles such as complex user experiences and scalability issues. Platforms like ICP brought these challenges to light, and Qubetics is here with solutions. Its non-custodial wallet ensures that users retain ownership of their digital assets, removing the need for intermediaries. This feature not only improves security but also enhances trust among users. The market response to Qubetics has been overwhelmingly positive. In its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $7.4 million and sold 365 million $TICS tokens, priced at just $0.0311. With over 11,100 token holders, the project has built a strong community, reflecting confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts Are Bullish: $10–$15 Predictions for $TICS It’s rare for a project to capture both market excitement and analyst confidence, but Qubetics has done just that. Experts predict that $TICS tokens could reach $10–$15 after the mainnet launch, thanks to Qubetics’ technological edge and growing adoption. The non-custodial wallet, for instance, is a game-changer for crypto users seeking security and simplicity. Combined with Qubetics’ scalability solutions, this innovation positions $TICS as a token with real-world utility—an essential factor for sustained growth in the crypto space. Don’t Let Another Opportunity Pass You By If you missed out on ICP, don’t let history repeat itself. Qubetics offers a second chance to be part of a blockchain revolution, combining cutting-edge technology with a user-centric approach. The current presale stage is your opportunity to secure $TICS tokens at just $0.034 before prices potentially skyrocket. With predictions of $10–$15 post-mainnet launch, the time to act is now. Qubetics isn’t just following in ICP’s footsteps; it’s carving out its own path as a blockchain leader. Whether you’re an investor or a tech enthusiast, this is your chance to ride the next wave of innovation. Visit the Qubetics presale platform today and claim your stake in the future of blockchain.

According to the authorities, the duo have been indicted for defrauding investors of over $22 million in crypto. A String of Broken Promises The U.S. attorney’s office states that between May 2021 and May 2024, the Southern California men engaged in “rug pull” schemes. They collected investments for Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital asset projects. However, the two men were not interested in actualizing the promises made to the investors. According to the prosecutor, in connivance with a yet-to-be-named co-conspirator, the duo collected $22.4 million from multiple rug pull schemes. These individuals, however, had no plans to see the projects through. Vault of Gems, Hay, and Mayo claimed it would be pegged to hard assets in one of their NFT projects. The men told their investors that the project had been designed to work with jewelers worldwide. They deceived investors with claims that Vault of Gems was already making its exchange to serve jewelry retailers. How Investors Discovered the Crypto Fraud Some investors first got a hint of the rug pull in a post on the Vault of Gems’ X account. To engage the community, the account had posted, “What’s happening?” in November 2021. The responses from members of the community alerted others to the fact that Hay and Mayo deleted parts of a community Discord channel. The channel served as a convergence platform for investors. One of the users, Mal (@MalPachinko) response, alleged that Hay and Mayo failed to deliver on the roadmap. Mal noted that the duo left about 1,900 token owners holding the bag with no hopes of recovering their investments. Analysts say the incident highlights why users in the crypto space need to familiarize themselves with different fraudulent schemes and how to avoid them . California Authority Assures Justice The authorities are accusing Hay and Mayo of transferring cryptocurrency realized from their projects into their wallets. This is part of the scheme to defraud their unsuspecting investors. Aside from the Vault of Gems rug pull scheme, others they carried out included projects titled Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Faceless, Uncovered, Dirty Dogs, and many more. Rug pull schemes come in various forms, including loss of value, as in the SnowdogDAO incident . Principal Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Nicole Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, promised to protect investors. Argentieri also assured the department would do everything possible to eliminate crypto fraud and bring offenders to justice.

Why $99,800 Is An Important Resistance To Break","The Bitcoin price is approaching the $100,000 level again after experiencing significant declines these past weeks. A crypto analyst has pointed out that the critical resistance level at $99,800 is crucial for Bitcoin’s next move. If the pioneer cryptocurrency can break through this level, it could trigger a significant breakout, potentially propelling Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance At $99,800 Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared a chart showing an In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) analysis of the distribution of Bitcoin wallets based on their purchase price. According to the analyst, the Bitcoin price is facing extreme resistance between the $97,500 and $99,800 price levels as it tries to breach $100,000 again. Martinez noted that around this price range, approximately 923,890 wallet addresses had purchased over 1.19 million BTC. This price zone acts as an important resistance level because many Bitcoin holders may look to sell and break even, potentially exerting selling pressure. In the IOMAP chart shared by Martinez, the green dots that signal ‘In the Money’ represent price levels below the current Bitcoin price, where wallet holders are in profit because they bought BTC at a lower value. On the other hand, the red dots that represent ‘Out of the Money’ show price levels of Bitcoin’s present value, where wallet holders are at a loss because they bought BTC at a higher price. Lastly, the white dot indicates ‘At the Money’ and represents the current price of Bitcoin at an average of $98,676, where some crypto wallets see neither profit nor loss. Below Bitcoin’s current price, the chart shows strong buying zones, which could provide strong support if the pioneer cryptocurrency experiences a potential pullback. Martinez has forecasted that breaking through the critical resistance range between $97,500 and $99,800 would signal the start of a bullish rally for Bitcoin, potentially leading it to a new all-time high. Currently, the Bitcoin price is trading at $98,652, steadily rising to return to previous highs above $100,000. To a new all-time high, Bitcoin will have to surge by over 7%, surpassing its present ATH above $104,000.

According to the analyst, Bitcoin has historically experienced its most significant gains right after Christmas during the halving years. The analyst shared a price chart showing Bitcoin’s market performance during each halving cycle. In the 2012 halving year, Bitcoin started a significant price rally, which extended into the following year. The same bullish trend occurred in the next halving years in 2016 and 2020, with Bitcoin hitting exponential price highs. Based on this historical trend, Crypto Rover projects that Bitcoin could witness a similar bullish surge before the end of 2024, with the rally potentially continuing into 2025.

The updated policy will permit advertisers offering crypto exchange products and services to run ads in the UK, provided they meet specific requirements. Google stated that ads for crypto exchanges and software wallets will only be allowed if the businesses are registered with the FCA. The policy will also extend to hardware wallets designed to store private keys for cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or other digital assets. However, ads for hardware wallets will only be permitted if they do not offer additional services such as buying, selling, or trading. While Google did not outline further requirements for hardware wallet advertisers, it emphasized the need to adhere to local regulations. “As a reminder, we expect all advertisers to comply with the local laws for any area that their ads target. This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these financial products,” Google stated. This means advertisers aiming to promote crypto-related products on Google must familiarize themselves with local regulations in their target jurisdictions and fulfill the necessary requirements set by financial regulators. The policy change comes amidst increased efforts by regulators to combat unauthorized crypto promotions. On December 16, the FCA issued a warning against “Retardio,” a Solana-based memecoin and NFT project. The FCA expressed concerns about the project’s unauthorized promotions targeting UK customers, cautioning that unregistered firms leave consumers at risk of losing funds without recourse if the business fails.

37939253,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631724,1734818606,Humanoid robots are getting better too fast thanks to AI advances,"Humanoid robots are advancing at breakneck speed, and it’s all thanks to the relentless progress in artificial intelligence. These machines, built to mimic human form and function, are no longer clunky prototypes stumbling over simple tasks. Now they’re equipped with advanced AI systems that enable them to perform real-world jobs, from factory lines to warehouses. And here’s the thing, some analysts think these robots could replace human workers on a massive scale by the end of the decade. “Breakthroughs in generative AI are giving robots the ability to see, think, and act,” said Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia’s VP of Omniverse and simulation technology. He’s not exaggerating. Sectors like manufacturing, retail, and logistics are already exploring how humanoid robots can fill critical gaps. A trillion-dollar race is on Wall Street is starting to catch on to the financial potential of humanoid robots. Citigroup predicts the humanoid robot market could hit $7 trillion by 2050, with over 1.19 billion of these machines in use globally. Morgan Stanley projects a slightly less 63 million robots by the same year. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates a $38 billion market by 2035. Analysts believe humanoid robots could eclipse autonomous vehicles in market potential. Tesla’s share price has already soared due to its work in AI and autonomy, but it’s clear that humanoid robots could be an even bigger opportunity. According to Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, the adoption curve for humanoid robots might move faster than robotaxis because these machines can immediately tackle repetitive and dangerous jobs. “The urgency to scale humanoids is palpable,” Jonas said. The Tesla wildcard Tesla, under the ever-controversial Elon Musk, has its eyes on the humanoid prize. The company’s Optimus robot was first revealed in 2021, but its capabilities were widely criticized for being underwhelming. Fast forward to today, and Tesla’s robotics ambitions are much more serious. Musk claims these robots could eventually make Tesla worth a mind-blowing $25 trillion. Tesla’s close ties to the incoming Trump administration will likely give it a massive edge. Analysts believe federal support for robotics could mirror previous subsidies for the semiconductor industry. Trump’s hardline immigration policies might also drive demand for automation, further boosting Tesla ’s robotics division. Nvidia powers the brains Behind many of these humanoid robots is Nvidia, the chipmaker that’s quietly dominating the AI space. Nvidia’s Project GR00T is a robotics platform that includes everything from AI models to simulation tools. XPeng, Boston Dynamics, and other robotics leaders are using this platform to accelerate their development. Nvidia also launched the Jetson Thor supercomputer earlier this year, designed specifically for robots. These technologies are important because humanoid robots need immense computational power to get through human-centric environments like homes and workplaces. According to Lebaredian, the company is working on GR00T models for motion control, whole-body coordination, and sensing, all of which are essential for humanoid robots to function effectively. While factories and warehouses are natural starting points, the real value of humanoid robots lies in consumer applications. Imagine robots that can babysit your kids, clean your house, or even cook your dinner. Some analysts believe this is where the big money is.

The doctor-patient communications platform ConnectOnCall, owned by health tech firm Phreesia, says 914,138 users are affected, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. In a statement, the firm says the breach exposed records shared in communications between doctors and patients including full names, phone numbers, dates of birth, health conditions, treatments, medications as well as Social Security numbers. “ConnectOnCall’s investigation revealed that between February 16, 2024, and May 12, 2024, an unknown third party had access to ConnectOnCall and certain data within the application, including certain information in provider-patient communications… ConnectOnCall took the ConnectOnCall product offline and has been working through a phased restoration of the product in a new, more secure environment.” ConnectOnCall allows patients to contact their doctors via text, phone call or telehealth for concerns about prescriptions, lab results and other medical issues. The firm sent letters to affected users earlier this month to shed light on the security incident while offering identity and credit monitoring services to individuals whose Social Security numbers were stolen. ConnectOnCall says users should stay alert and immediately report any suspicious activity related to identity theft or healthcare fraud.

Such developments could mark a transformative phase for Ripple and its XRP token, elevating its status among institutional and retail investors alike. However, while XRP price gathers attention, investors and traders are shifting their focus to PropiChain , a revolutionary altcoin positioned to deliver an unprecedented 30,000% growth by early 2025. As the spotlight shines brighter on Ripple and its competitors, PropiChain emerges as a powerful player, disrupting industries far beyond the financial sector. XRP Price Gains Momentum Amid ETF Speculation The XRP Price has experienced a notable bump in recent weeks, largely fueled by speculation surrounding a potential ETF approval. This comes after the SEC’s legal battle with Ripple saw significant breakthroughs, boosting confidence in XRP’s regulatory future. Why an XRP ETF Matters Increased Accessibility: An ETF would make XRP investments easier for institutional and retail investors, driving liquidity and demand. Institutional Adoption: Similar to Bitcoin ETFs, an XRP ETF could trigger significant institutional inflows, further stabilizing and boosting its price. Market Legitimacy: ETF approval signals regulatory acceptance, potentially paving the way for other crypto-focused financial products. While the XRP Price rallies on ETF optimism, analysts warn that significant gains may already be priced in. This leaves traders seeking untapped opportunities in emerging altcoins like PropiChain , where growth potential remains exponential. PropiChain: The Altcoin Set to Dominate PropiChain is a blockchain-based platform redefining real estate investments in a market valued at over $300 trillion. PropiChain’s innovative ecosystem combines blockchain, AI, and tokenization to solve major inefficiencies in the real estate sector. Features That Make PropiChain Stand Out PropiChain is a trailblazer in the crypto space, offering features that directly benefit investors: AI-Powered Market Insights: PropiChain’s advanced AI tools analyze global real estate markets in real-time, identifying undervalued properties and emerging opportunities. Tokenized Real Estate: By tokenizing properties, PropiChain allows investors to buy and sell fractional ownership, increasing liquidity and flexibility. Metaverse Integration: PropiChain is pioneering virtual property tours and global networking events in the metaverse, enhancing the buyer and seller experience. Security Audits: PropiChain’s infrastructure has been rigorously tested and certified, including a comprehensive BlockAudit review , ensuring top-tier security for its users. Global Listings: PropiChain’s CoinMarketCap listing adds to its credibility and market visibility, attracting a broader investor base. PropiChain Presale: A Huge Opportunity PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011. This marks a critical juncture for early adopters, as the price will jump to $0.023 in Stage 3. Why the Presale is a Game-Changer Low Entry Point: At just $0.011 per token, even small investments can yield massive returns. For instance, a $1,000 investment today could potentially grow to over $300,000 if PropiChain reaches its projected price of $7.15. Exponential Growth: Analysts predict PropiChain could mirror early Bitcoin or XRP growth trajectories, making this presale a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Limited Supply: With a finite number of tokens available, demand is expected to outpace supply rapidly, driving prices even higher. XRP vs. PropiChain: A Comparative Analysis While the XRP Price remains a focal point for many crypto enthusiasts, PropiChain offers distinct advantages that make it a compelling alternative: Utility Beyond Finance: Unlike XRP, which focuses on cross-border payments, PropiChain addresses the vast and underserved real estate market. Higher Growth Potential: XRP price growth may be capped due to its existing market penetration, while PropiChain’s untapped potential offers significantly higher returns. Investor Accessibility: PropiChain’s fractional ownership model allows anyone to participate, whereas XRP requires a more traditional investment approach. Why Now is the Right Time The clock is ticking for those looking to secure PropiChain tokens at the current presale price of $0.011. With its next stage price set at $0.023, early investors stand to benefit significantly from getting in now. Historical Comparisons: PropiChain’s growth potential mirrors XRP price’s early days when it surged from $0.002 to over $3 within months. Life-Changing Returns: Even a modest $500 investment in PropiChain today could grow to over $165,000 by 2025. Upcoming Milestones: As PropiChain completes its presale and launches its platform, demand is expected to skyrocket, making this the lowest price you’ll ever see for this token. Conclusion While the XRP Price continues to make headlines, the real opportunity lies with PropiChain, a groundbreaking altcoin disrupting the real estate industry. Its innovative features, robust ecosystem, and rare growth potential make it a must-have in any investor’s portfolio. With the presale in full swing and token prices set to increase, the time to act is now. Don’t miss this chance to be part of something this big!

37938893,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375465,1734818127,Argentina’s Mining Sector Pioneers Lithium Tokenization by Tapping Cardano,"Cardano’s blockchain technology is set to revolutionize the Argentine lithium industry through an agreement with three players in the sector: Atómico 3, Zengate, and Alto Grande. The collaboration will introduce the world’s first lithium tokenization project, a disruptive initiative scheduled for launch in Q1 2025. Mechanics of Tokenization According to local reports , the project will use blockchain technology to convert the property rights of lithium into digital tokens. This will allow investors to trade fractional shares of the mineral without physically handling or owning it. The process is intended to democratize resource access, improve liquidity, and facilitate international trade through secure and immutable blockchain-based transactions. Argentina is home to some of the world’s largest lithium deposits, with most concentrated in Catamarca, Salta, and Jujuy. The metal is not only a cornerstone of electric vehicle (EV) batteries and renewable energy storage but also critical in the global transition to cleaner energy. Some analysts estimate that the EV industry alone could be worth a mind-blowing $1.3 trillion in the next three years, fueled by growing worldwide demand. While the country’s ore export is expected to exceed $5.5 billion in 2025, the sector is still facing challenges related to accountability in the supply chain. To address this, the tokenization project will facilitate greater traceability and authenticity of the material, helping reduce the risk of fraud and ensuring ethical and environmental standards are met. It will also help improve collaboration between the Argentine government and mining firms, ensuring they adhere to transparent and ecologically friendly practices. Opportunities for Argentina Tokenizing real-world assets like minerals could become a multi-billion dollar endeavor by the end of the decade. A recent report by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) suggested such assets could represent at least 1% of the global mutual fund and ETF market by 2030, translating into a $600 billion business. Speaking exclusively to CryptoPotato, Atómico 3 founder Pablo Rutigliano highlighted the economic and environmental significance of the tokenization initiative, saying: “Blockchain’s distributed ledger allows stakeholders to trace the provenance of lithium, ensuring it is ethically and sustainably sourced. For instance, stakeholders can confirm adherence to local labor laws, environmental standards, and water usage metrics, which are crucial concerns in Argentina’s lithium-rich regions.” According to him, the project will benefit both local and international communities. The initiative is a chance for economic inclusion, job creation, and fair revenue distribution for the country’s mining sector. Rutigliano believes the venture will allow profits to reach local producers and communities by reducing reliance on intermediaries. Furthermore, he said that introducing blockchain-based platforms will create demand for tech-savvy roles and training opportunities. For investors, a tokenized version of the metal improves market accessibility by enabling fractional ownership and 24/7 trading, boosting liquidity and reducing transaction costs.

37938667,https://coinpaper.com/6673/xrp-ally-john-deaton-says-musk-led-d-o-g-e-is-necessary-to-cut-government-spending,1734817682,XRP Ally John Deaton Says Musk-led D.O.G.E Is Necessary to Cut Government Spending,"On Saturday, pro-XRP attorney John Deaton shared on his Twitter/X account a TikTok that featured John Stewart criticizing Pentagon spending captioned “If you think Elon Musk’s and Vivek Ramaswamy’s D.O.G.E isn’t necessary, watch this!” In a TikTok posted by Conservative Newst Today, Stewart criticized the U.S. Department of Defense for its unmonitored spending despite a colossal $850 billion budget. Speaking in a debate with a smug DOD official, the comedian pointed out the puzzling disparity between the Pentagon's massive budget and the daily struggles of low-ranked service members, some of whom still rely on government assistance to get food on the table. “We got out of 20 years of war, and the Pentagon got a raise,” Stewart put bluntly. “I can’t figure out how $850 billion to a department means that the rank and file still have to be on food stamps. To me, that’s f*cking corruption.” John Deaton gained recognition in the crypto community for his support of Ripple Labs and its cryptocurrency, XRP, where he filed an amicus brief on behalf of XRP holders, arguing that the SEC’s classification of the cryptocurrency as a security unfairly harmed retail investors. Deaton is also a founder of CryptoLaw, a legal platform meant to be a one-stop shop for public information, links to news articles, and probing analysis on the regulatory landscape of the US crypto industry. As a Republican candidate in Massachusetts, Deaton tried to unseat staunch crypto skeptic Elizabeth Warren in the 2024 US Senate elections, albeit unsuccessfully. While not necessarily warranted against all government agencies, Deaton's frustration at the federal government's inefficacies is at least understandable in the context of his protracted legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency recently sued a US-based crypto project, Dragonchain, alleging that its foundation conducted a $16.5 million unregistered offering of DRGN tokens. The court filing indicated the SEC’s readiness to pursue the case despite Chair Gensler’s imminent departure scheduled for the Inauguration Day on January 20. The incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins is expected to enforce the Trump administration's pro-crypto agenda. For context, the Department of Government Efficiency, named after the mercurial billionaire’s favorite cryptocurrency, will be co-led by Elon Musk himself, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and House GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. While the “department” in its name may suggest that D.O.G.E will be a full-fledged government agency, President-elect Donald Trump said that it will “provide advice and guidance from outside of government,” suggesting that D.O.G.E. will function more as an independent advisory body. Musk’s role being informal will also allow him to remain the head of his electric car maker Tesla, social media platform X, and rocket company SpaceX without raising inevitable questions about potential conflicts of interest. D.O.G.E’s primary focus will be to identify inefficiencies in federal spending, pawing the way for the new administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,” as per Trump’s statement. The work of the department will conclude no later than July 4, 2026, which is the date of the 250th anniversary of The US Declaration of Independence. Ripple donates $5 million to Trump’s inauguration Meanwhile, the US crypto companies, including Ripple, are doubling down on their financial support for Donald Trump, pledging millions to his inauguration celebrations. The three-day-long event will feature galas, parades, and dinners celebrating Trump's win alongside Vice President-elect JD Vance According to Fox News , blockchain payment firm Ripple contributed $5 million in XRP tokens. Cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Kraken donated $1 million each, while digital asset payment provider MoonPay vowed to donate an undisclosed amount. Interestingly, Ripple’s chairman and co-founder Chris Larsen has been one of the top contributors to Kamala Harris’ campaign, donating more than $11 million to the Future Forward PAC supporting her presidency bid. Meanwhile, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was reportedly one of the first crypto execs to score a one-to-one meeting with Donald Trump days after his win. The millions flowing from the crypto firms are just a tiny part of the record-breaking $200 million already raised by the inaugural fund, surpassing Trump’s first term's $107 million and trouncing Biden’s $62 million. A source close to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee expressed confidence that they will be able to reach a $225 milestone by Inauguration Day. The big tech joined alongside crypto companies in contributing to the fund, with top business executives such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and OpenAI's Sam Altman each donating $1 million. “Amazon donates $1 million while Ripple donates $5M,” John Deaton posted on X in response to the news. “New era.”",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6673/xrp-ally-john-deaton-says-musk-led-d-o-g-e-is-necessary-to-cut-government-spending,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37938568,https://crypto.news/?p=14319623,1734817438,"10 companies launch Bitcoin treasuries, but not Microsoft: Here are the risks, benefits","Microsoft shareholders nixed a Bitcoin treasury idea, but other big-name companies disagree with this strategy. Here’s why. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is often likened to “digital gold,” with its fixed supply of 21 million coins making it a potential hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. And nowadays, Bitcoin’s unique characteristics make it an attractive addition to corporate treasuries. It can balance exposure to traditional assets like cash, stocks, and bonds. Bitcoin is also one of the most liquid assets globally, and its historical performance has shown significant long-term value appreciation — it reached an all-time high of over $108,000 on Dec. 17 . But there’s no shortage of risks. A board might avoid adopting a Bitcoin treasury due to the coin’s extreme price volatility, which can lead to substantial losses during downturns. Also, regulatory uncertainties pose potential threats as governments refine crypto policies. Additionally, liquidity challenges during market slumps can amplify price drops when offloading assets. So it’s no wonder that, on Dec. 10, Microsoft’s board channeled the long-standing crypto skepticism of its co-founder, Bill Gates, and recommended ditching the proposa for a Bitcoin trasury. Gates himself has famously dismissed crypto as “100% based on greater fool theory” — ouch. Bitcoin evangelist and MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor was busy trying to woo Microsoft when he touted Bitcoin’s own meteoric returns and bragged about MicroStrategy’s stock soaring after their BTC splurge. His pitch? Bitcoin could boost Microsoft’s market cap while acting as a financial guardian angel. Microsoft’s response? No, thanks. Meanwhile, at least 10 other companies are embracing the MicroStrategy playbook. Table of Contents Genius Group Worksport Amazon MicroStrategy Marathon Digital Holdings Tesla Coinbase Hut 8 Mining Corp Block Inc. OneMedNet Genius Group Genius Group, an AI-powered education group, announced in November that it had completed the purchase of 110 Bitcoin for $10 million, at an average price of $90,932 per Bitcoin. The purchase made good on a promise to employ what it called a “Bitcoin-first” strategy where it planed to commit 90% or more of its current and future reserves to be held in Bitcoin, with an initial target of $120 million in Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the company bolstered its Bitcoin treasury by acquiring 194 Bitcoin worth $18 million at an average price of $92,728 per Bitcoin. Genius Group CEO Roger Hamilton credited Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury plan for the inspiration, adding that “more companies will see the benefits of establishing a Bitcoin treasury, and will be equipped with the clear steps to follow.” Worksport Worksport, a U.S.-based provider of pickup truck solutions, is adding cyptocurency to its corporate treasury strategy. The Nasdaq-listed company announced on Dec. 5 that it would be adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP ( XRP ) to its treasury assets. This follows a resolution by the company’s board of directors, which approved an initial purchase of $5 million worth of BTC and XRP. Worksport is committing 10% of its excess operational cash to this corporate pivot, it said in the announcement. “Our upcoming adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (Ripple) reflects our commitment to staying ahead of market trends while prioritizing operational efficiency and shareholder value. As we expand our product offerings and global reach, cryptocurrency has the potential to be a strong strategic complement,” Steven Rossi, chief executive officer of Worksport, said. Amazon Amazon shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research , are urging the Seattle-based company’s board to assess the potential benefits of adding Bitcoin to the company’s financial strategy. The proposal, submitted on Dec. 6, aims to explore whether Bitcoin could protect and enhance shareholder value, especially amid persistent inflation and declining yields from traditional assets. The National Center emphasizes Bitcoin’s robust performance—131% growth in the past year and 1,246% over five years—as evidence of its potential as an inflation hedge and a growth asset. The initiative also highlights concerns about the diminishing purchasing power of Amazon’s $88 billion cash reserves due to average inflation of 4.95% over the past four years. This move represents a broader trend of shareholder proposals influencing corporate policies, leveraging shareholder rights to advocate for financial strategies that address economic risks and enhance long-term value. MicroStrategy Perhaps the most vocal of all Bitcoin fans is MicroStrategy’s Saylor who, as of this past week, increased the company’s total holdings to 439,000. As a result, Saylor has officially strengthening MicroStrategy’s position as the top corporate BTC holder, considering it a long-term store of value. Saylor, during an appearance on the Dec. 18 episode of the Open Interest show on Bloomberg Television, even voiced his willingness to advise President-elect Donald Trump on crafting a digital assets policy for the U.S. But Saylor continues to draw scrutiny: Analyst Jacob King has labeled MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused business model a “giant scam,” claiming it is unsustainable and destined for collapse. MicroStrategy’s business model is a giant scam and relies on a reflexive loop: it issues debt or equity to buy BTC, which drives BTC’s price higher. This increases MSTR’s market cap, boosts its index weight, and attracts more sheep investors. With a higher valuation, it issues… pic.twitter.com/Owyi7mCHaO — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) December 17, 2024 Marathon Digital Holdings As one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies, Marathon owns 44,394 BTC. Its business model revolves entirely around mining and holding Bitcoin as part of its assets​. Back in July, the company confirmed it will adopt “a full HODL approach” towards its Bitcoin treasury policy, retaining all that it mines within its operations, in addition to its open market purchases. “Adopting a full HODL strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin,” CEO Fred Thiel stated. “We believe bitcoin is the world’s best treasury reserve asset and support the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding it. We encourage governments and corporations to all hold bitcoin as a reserve asset.” Tesla Tesla initially bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in 2021 and currently holds 9,720 BTC. While the Elon Musk-led company remains a significant corporate holder​. BitcoinTreasuries data shows that Tesla is the fourth-largest holder of Bitcoin among U.S. public companies with crypto treasuries (MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms are believed to hold more). In October, the electric vehicle company reportedly moved $765 million worth of Bitcoin to unidentified wallets. Coinbase The cryptocurrency exchange holds 9,480 BTC as part of its reserves, leveraging its position as a major player in the digital asset ecosystem​. The Brian Armstrong-led firm holds large amounts of Bitcoin as an exchange and converter. It’s also a trusted institution for custody services, and counts the Bitcoin ETF coterie of BlackRock, Grayscale, 21Shares, Invesco, Valkyrie, Wisdom Tree and Franklin Templeton among its clients. Therefore, Coinbase has a Bitcoin treasury for itself and oversees others. Hut 8 Mining Corp On Thursday, crypto.news reported that Hut 8, a Bitcoin mining company, added 990 Bitcoin to its reserves. The company spent roughly $100 million to increase its total holdings to 10,096 BTC. The reserve, now valued at over $1 billion, places Hut 8 among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The company, under the guidance of CEO Asher Genoot, purchased the coins at an average price of $101,710, significantly higher than its cumulative acquisition cost of $24,484 per Bitcoin. Block Inc. The startup (formerly Square) holds 8,027 BTC as part of its strategy to integrate Bitcoin into mainstream finance. The Jack Dorsey-founded company is so bullish on Bitcoin that, last month, it confirmed a company-wide pivot towards the cryptocurrency mining sector. Block decided to dial down resources towards music streaming service TIDAL, and sunset TBD, a venture focusing on decentralizing the internet, to focus on expanding its presence in the Bitcoin mining sector. Block acquired TIDAL in a 2021 acquisition for roughly $300 million. The platform has continued to struggle, with reports indicating workforce reductions and a $132.3 million impairment charge .

While some folks are still hesitant about diving into the digital asset world , savvy investors are already taking massive returns. It’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum anymore—newer projects with game-changing tech and solid fundamentals are stealing the limelight. If you’re itching to find the best cryptos to join this weekend, you’re in the right place. One name-making wave in the crypto sphere is Qubetics ($TICS). With its presale gaining momentum and a future that looks brighter than the Las Vegas Strip, Qubetics is a project you can’t afford to overlook. Let’s dig into what makes Qubetics, alongside established giants like Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX), the hottest cryptos to invest in this weekend. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain and Tokenisation Qubetics isn’t your average crypto project. It’s a powerhouse redefining blockchain development while making it accessible to everyone—from tech newbies to seasoned developers. In its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 365 million $TICS tokens to more than 11,100 holders, raising a whopping $7.4 million. At just $0.0342 per token, the potential upside is staggering. Analysts need to catch up on the numbers. They’re predicting $TICS could hit $10 or even $15 after the mainnet launch, boasting an ROI of up to 43,711%. For context, investing $50,000 today could potentially turn into a jaw-dropping $21.8 million. Don’t let that sink in for too long—opportunities like this don’t come daily. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its focus on “ Real World Asset Tokenisation .” Imagine being able to tokenise your real estate property, art collection, or even intellectual property. For businesses, this could mean raising funds faster than you can say “traditional banking” by offering fractional ownership to investors globally. Individuals? They get to liquefy high-value assets without losing control. Think about tokenising a family heirloom to pay for college or medical bills while keeping the sentimental value intact. It’s like having your cake and eating it, too. Beyond tokenisation, Qubetics is a one-stop shop for blockchain innovation. Its QubeQode IDE simplifies smart contract development, while the multi-chain wallet and decentralised VPN address key interoperability and privacy issues. In short, it’s a tech-driven ecosystem poised to drive Web3 adoption on a global scale. Polkadot (DOT): Bridging Blockchains Like a Pro Polkadot isn’t just another name in the crypto game; it’s a trailblazer. Known for its ability to connect different blockchains, Polkadot has carved out a niche that few can rival. The project’s focus on interoperability means developers and enterprises can build decentralised applications (dApps) that work across multiple blockchain networks seamlessly. It’s like building a Lego set where every piece fits perfectly, no matter where it comes from. Since its inception, Polkadot has been a go-to for investors who want a mix of innovation and stability. It’s not the flashiest crypto, but it’s reliable, which keeps it in the spotlight. DOT tokens have steadily risen in value, serving as a solid alternative investment for diversifying beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Its staking mechanism is another feather in its cap, rewarding holders with a consistent income stream. Polkadot’s parachain auctions have been a game-changer, allowing projects to secure dedicated slots on its network. This unique approach has turned Polkadot into a launchpad for promising blockchain projects, adding layers of value to its ecosystem. Whether you’re a casual investor or a hardcore trader, Polkadot offers something for everyone. Looking ahead, Polkadot’s ability to adapt and grow makes it a prime candidate for long-term portfolios. DOT should be on your radar if you’re after one of the best cryptos to join this weekend. Avalanche (AVAX): The Speed Demon of Blockchains Regarding speed and scalability, Avalanche is in a league of its own. Launched to tackle Ethereum’s congestion, Avalanche has quickly become a favourite among developers and investors. Its high-performance blockchain can handle over 4,500 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the game. Avalanche’s recent ‘Avalanche9000’ upgrade is a testament to its commitment to innovation. By lowering transaction fees and introducing cost-effective subnets, Avalanche is establishing itself as a developer’s dream platform. Projects building on Avalanche benefit from its efficiency, and users enjoy lightning-fast, low-cost transactions. It’s a win-win. From DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces, Avalanche has its hands in every pie. The ecosystem’s growth has been phenomenal, attracting big-name investors and developers. If you’ve been sleeping on AVAX, now might be the time to wake up. It’s trading just 20% below its all-time high, teasing a breakout that could soar prices. Avalanche’s appeal lies in its ability to deliver what it promises. It’s not just a hype machine; it’s a project with real-world utility and a robust community. Whether you’re into staking, trading, or just holding for the long haul, Avalanche is a strong contender among the best cryptos to join this weekend. Conclusion The crypto market moves fast, and hesitation can cost you. Qubetics offers a golden opportunity to get in early on a project with massive upside. Meanwhile, Polkadot and Avalanche are proven players who continue delivering value. These projects represent a mix of innovation, reliability, and potential that’s hard to beat. Don’t sit on the sidelines. Head to Qubetics’ presale page now, or grab some DOT and AVAX from your favourite exchange. The best cryptos to join this weekend won’t wait around forever, so why should you?

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-to-surge-15000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-pepe-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37937230,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313614,1734814859,Investor Anthony Pompliano Says 2025 Will Be a ‘Great Year’ for Bitcoin – Here Are His Reasons,"Pomp Investments founder Anthony Pompliano remains long-term bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ) despite the flagship crypto asset falling below the $100,000 psychological price level. Pompliano says in a FOX 5 interview that “2025 will continue to be a great year for Bitcoin.” According to the investor, two factors are likely to drive the price of Bitcoin to greater heights. “One, you’re going to continue to get printing of money both in the United States and globally. And then two is you have a Federal Reserve that is cutting interest rates. And as that M2 money supply grows and interest rates go down, you get cheap capital coming into the market.” Pompliano also explains why Bitcoin’s rising prices and increasing market cap make BTC “less risky” for deep-pocketed investors. “If you go back and you look at it when Bitcoin was at $1,000, there was plenty of these large capital pools that said, ‘This thing’s new, this thing is too small. I need to put tens of billions of dollars into an investment, I can’t do it with this, it’s too risky.’ Now as Bitcoin has gotten bigger and it’s gotten to a $2 trillion market cap, now all of a sudden everyone’s like, ‘Wait a second, I can put money in it. It’s derisked. This is an opportunity for me.’ And so as the price continues to go higher, more of these large pools of capital will come in. As large pools of capital come in to buy a finite-supply asset, price should continue to go up.” Bitcoin is trading at $97,363 at time of writing.

37937178,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666159,1734814825,Bitcoin Will Test ATH Once It Breaks This Strong Supply Zone – Details,"Bitcoin is currently trading at $97,600, following a sharp dip from its all-time high and a modest recovery from the critical $92,000 support level. This recent price movement highlights the market’s ongoing volatility as investors grapple with shifting sentiment and technical levels. Despite the rebound, Bitcoin now faces a significant challenge in sustaining its upward momentum. Related Reading: XRP Whales Loading Up – Data Reveals Buying Activity Analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling data revealing that Bitcoin encounters a massive resistance zone between $97,500 and $99,800. This “brick wall” is fortified by the activity of 924,000 wallets, which collectively purchased over 1.19 million BTC in this range. Such strong on-chain resistance could hinder BTC’s ability to reclaim the psychological $100,000 level in the near term. This critical area will likely determine Bitcoin’s next move. Successfully breaking through this zone could pave the way for another rally, while failure to do so might lead to heightened selling pressure and a retest of lower support levels. As the market watches this pivotal phase unfolds, all eyes remain on key technical and on-chain signals to gauge whether Bitcoin’s recovery is sustainable or if a larger correction looms ahead. Bitcoin Holding Strong Bitcoin has experienced intense price swings over the past few days, with a 15% correction followed by a swift 6% bounce in under three days. This rapid movement highlights the serious volatility gripping the market, with Bitcoin mirroring the broader uncertainty. Despite the turbulence, there is growing optimism among analysts regarding Bitcoin’s outlook, as its recovery from aggressive selling pressure yesterday took only a few hours. Martinez shared key insights on X, shedding light on a significant resistance zone that Bitcoin must overcome to regain momentum. According to Martinez, Bitcoin faces a “brick wall” between $97,500 and $99,800. This range is fortified by 924,000 wallets that collectively purchased over 1.19 million BTC within these levels. This substantial cluster of on-chain resistance could act as a barrier to Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals No Significant Panic Selling In The Market – Shakeout Or Trend Shift? If Bitcoin can manage to break above this critical resistance zone, it could open the door to new all-time highs. However, failure to surpass this range may lead to increased selling pressure and further consolidation below the $100,000 mark. For now, Bitcoin remains resilient, holding its ground amid market volatility, with many analysts cautiously optimistic about its potential for another rally. Technical Analysis Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,200, showing a strong recovery from the $92,000 mark, which has proven to be a significant demand level. This reaction from $92K signals strength in Bitcoin’s price action, indicating the potential for bullish momentum in the weeks ahead. If BTC manages to push above the critical $100,000 level in the coming days, it could trigger a massive surge, potentially driving the price to new all-time highs. This psychological and technical milestone is expected to ignite a wave of buying pressure as investors and traders anticipate the next leg of the rally. However, the market remains uncertain, and the possibility of Bitcoin entering a sideways consolidation phase cannot be ruled out. In this scenario, BTC could remain range-bound between its all-time highs and local lows, reflecting a period of accumulation as the market recalibrates after recent volatility. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details For now, the $92,000 mark has provided a strong foundation for Bitcoin, and all eyes are on the $100,000 level as the next major test.

With fresh concepts and growing communities, five standout tokens are positioning themselves as potential game-changers. These emerging cryptocurrencies could redefine fortunes by 2025, capturing attention beyond the usual favorites. Curious which names might dominate the next chapter? The spotlight is shifting—don’t miss out. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Brett: Cultural Icon and Mascot of Base Chain Brett is the mascot of Base Chain and a cultural symbol in the crypto space. It represents the expanding ecosystem of Base Chain, which hosts various projects and applications. This ecosystem offers a supportive environment for Brett to grow and potentially increase its role. As Base Chain develops, Brett may benefit from the broader resources and innovations within the platform. Its appeal in the market depends on the ongoing growth and adoption of Base Chain technology. BOME: A Memecoin Merging Culture and Decentralized Tech BOME, or the Book of Meme, is an experimental project combining memes, blockchain storage, and cryptocurrency trading. It uses decentralized platforms like Arweave, IPFS, and plans to expand to Bitcoin inscriptions for permanent storage. The project aims to preserve and celebrate meme culture through its $BOME token on the Solana blockchain. By creating an unstoppable collection of digital content, it explores new possibilities for decentralized social media and online culture. The unique blend of creativity, technology, and community engagement positions the coin as an intriguing concept in the crypto market. Its appeal largely depends on user interest in meme culture and the broader market’s performance. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Dog-Themed Meme Coin on Solana Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. It is inspired by the popular Dogwifhat meme and aims to provide a fun, community-driven experience. Meme coins often gain attention due to their ties to internet trends, with dog-related tokens being especially popular. WIF focuses on creating engagement through its community rather than offering utility like traditional cryptocurrencies. Its current appeal lies in its viral and lighthearted nature, traits that historically attract short-term investor interest. The coin’s potential depends on its ability to maintain online visibility and grow its community during this phase of the market. The technology behind Solana ensures fast and low-cost transactions, which may help the coin sustain user activity. Mew: A Unique Cryptocurrency with a Feline Focus Mew is a cryptocurrency themed around a cat navigating a market dominated by dog-related coins. It aims to stand out with a distinct identity and engage users through its creative concept. The coin seeks to build its own ecosystem while addressing gaps in the current market of meme coins. Its potential lies in offering differentiation and novelty in an oversaturated meme coin space. Whether Mew is an attractive option depends on market conditions, competition, and development progress. Conclusion BRETT, BOME, WIF, and MEW may appeal to some, but their potential is more limited short-term. DOGEN, however, stands out with a bold vision of luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by presale’s end and strong market aspirations, it positions itself as a top contender for massive gains and a community of driven leaders.

This development hints at a major shift in the crypto landscape, capturing the attention of investors everywhere. Trump’s Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s price has seen notable fluctuations recently. In the past week, ETH has dropped by 10.38%, indicating a short-term bearish trend. However, over the last month, the cryptocurrency has risen by 7.05%, showing signs of recovery. Looking at the six-month timeframe, ETH has experienced a slight decline of 2.34%, reflecting overall market volatility. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $3,648.43 and $4,137.17. The nearest resistance level is at $4,317.86, while the closest support is at $3,340.38. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 20.60, suggesting that ETH is oversold and may be due for a rebound. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $3,622.00, which is below the 100-day average of $3,869.08, indicating a potential shift in momentum. If Ethereum manages to break above the resistance at $4,317.86, it could aim for the next target at $4,806.60, representing a possible increase of around 16%. On the downside, falling below the support at $3,340.38 might lead to a drop towards $2,851.64, which would be a decrease of approximately 22%. Traders are watching these key levels closely to gauge Ethereum’s next move. Conclusion ETH and other coins are strong, but XYZVerse’s sports memecoin aims for 20,000% growth, uniting sports fans in the 2024 bull run’s biggest market shakeup.

37936857,https://nulltx.com/?p=136179,1734814090,Four Meme Coins That Might Disappoint and One That Could Deliver Big Gains,"Meme coins are the wild cards of the crypto world—one day they’re “to the moon,” and the next, they’re nose-diving to the abyss. It’s a rollercoaster that leaves many investors frustrated. You throw $100 into a so-called “moonshot” coin, dreaming of millionaire status, but instead, you wake up as just another bag-holder. So, how do you avoid burning your cash? Smart decisions, folks. Here’s a rundown of meme coin flops that failed to deliver and one underdog that’s stealing the spotlight. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Sliding on Thin Ice Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT ecosystem, made a splash on launch but quickly sank. A jaw-dropping 51% drop in just 24 hours slashed its market cap from $4 million to $2 million. Popcat (POPCAT): Clawing Its Way Down Inspired by the viral “Popcat” meme, Popcat (POPCAT) was all hype, no substance. Within a month, it fell 47%, losing 19% in a week and 8% in a single day, with trading volume shrinking by 11%. DOGS Token (DOGS): Barking Up the Wrong Tree Launched on the TON blockchain to leverage Telegram’s massive user base, DOGS Token (DOGS) is struggling to stay afloat. Its price plummeted 33% in 30 days, with a 7% daily drop and declining market cap. Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT): Declawed and Declining Despite its nostalgic charm and animal welfare focus, Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT) couldn’t escape the meme coin curse. Over the past month, it dropped 25%, shedding 2.9% in a week and a brutal 27% in 24 hours, with trading volume down 40%. These animals are not cutting it anymore. The meme coin market is turning into a zoo. It’s a tired concept that’s lost its spark. Every new coin looks like a clone of the last, offering nothing fresh or exciting. In this overcrowded jungle of meme coins, one project is standing out by ditching the furry trend altogether. A fresh concept is drawing the spotlight, shining with something beyond the same old gimmicks. XYZVerse +1,233%—And This Champion is Just Warming Up Among a bunch of creepy animals, $XYZ brings something new to the table. It is the first ever all-sports meme coin rewriting the playbook with its relentless drive and competitive spirit, much like the athletes who inspire it. XYZVerse forms an ecosystem designed for champions, bringing together sports fans, gamers, and crypto enthusiasts under one vibrant banner. Currently in presale, $XYZ is already scoring big: Launch Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.001333 (+1233%) Final Stage Target: $0.1—an unbelievable 99,900% surge if achieved.

These are calculated steps to ensure $XYZ has the staying power most meme coins lack. What’s Next for $XYZ? With the presale nearing its final stages, the real action is about to begin. The Token Generation Event (TGE) and public listings are on the horizon, and that’s when $XYZ will step into the global spotlight. More exposure, more liquidity, and a stronger community mean the potential for even greater growth. XYZVerse is building an ecosystem where sports fandom meets crypto culture, creating a space where engagement and rewards go hand in hand. If the presale results are anything to go by, this is only the beginning of what $XYZ can achieve. Choose Your Meme Coin Wisely The meme coin market is often treacherous terrain, filled with flashy promises and underwhelming results.

Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum that pays tribute to the famous Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. It’s a deflationary memecoin with a catchy theme and a straightforward approach. Unlike other complicated projects, PEPE embraces its meme roots and keeps things pure and simple. There’s no utility promised, and the team is upfront about it. They appeal to the crypto community by having no transaction taxes and focusing purely on being a fun and engaging token. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw an explosive surge that pushed its market cap to a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive gains, turning some into millionaires overnight. This surge sparked what many call a “memecoin season,” with other meme-based tokens experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes plans to get listed on major exchanges and aims for a “meme takeover.” While it’s uncertain if PEPE and other memecoins will reach new highs, many in the crypto community are hopeful, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. In a market where memes can drive value, PEPE stands out as an attractive coin for those looking to ride the next big wave.

In a recent update, Saylor mentioned that he is ready to participate should President-elect Donald Trump establish a crypto advisory council. He is willing to guide the President-elect on crypto matters to shape and reform the country’s digital assets policy. Michael Saylor and The Big Bet on Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s commitment to Bitcoin goes beyond words. Since 2020, he has actively supported Bitcoin, even putting his money where his mouth is. Having personally invested nearly $1 billion in Bitcoin, Saylor’s dedication to the digital currency has been unmatched. That year, he proudly announced that he owned 17,732 BTC. This was even before his company, MicroStrategy, made its first large-scale purchase of the asset. Today, MicroStrategy owns a staggering 440,000 BTC, accounting for nearly 2% of the Bitcoin supply. This massive accumulation is no accident. Saylor has called Bitcoin the “apex property of the human race.” He drew comparisons to the territories of Manhattan and Alaska that were once purchased during early American colonization. For him, Bitcoin represents the future, an essential piece of cyberspace that the U.S. should own in bulk. Donald Trump’s Crypto Shift and Saylor’s Support Like many others, Michael Saylor sees Trump as the most Bitcoin and crypto-friendly Republican politician. Although Saylor is not a strong supporter of the Republican Party, he believes it has become more open to progressive changes in crypto regulation. He supports their push to treat crypto as a tool for economic growth and lower regulatory pressure. Also, it encourages individuals to pursue their financial goals using digital assets, especially Bitcoin. Before now, Trump was never a fan of crypto. Once a critic of Bitcoin, calling it “not money” and “based on thin air.” However, in recent years, his views on crypto have changed significantly. During his campaigns this year, he accepted crypto donations and attended a major crypto conference. He publicly promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. The Creation of a Crypto Advisory Council Trump’s crypto journey is taking shape with the announcement of a potential crypto advisory council. While details remain scarce, some industry leaders seek to engage with the incoming administration . These include Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). If established, the council is expected to be key in shaping future crypto policies. This comes after Trump’s proposed tax cuts for crypto companies, creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Trump has recently appointed pro-crypto executives to hold significant positions in his incoming administration. These moves are expected to impact the direction of crypto regulation in the U.S positively .

37936348,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631716,1734812772,Bitcoin is overdue a correction. How low could prices go post-Trump Inauguration?,"Bitcoin’s rally is hitting a wall, and the numbers are lining up for a big correction in the next month. October saw the global money supply hit a peak of $108.5 trillion, pushing Bitcoin to its record $108,000 high. But here’s the twist: over the last two months, the money supply has dropped by $4.1 trillion, now sitting at $104.4 trillion—its lowest since August. Historically, Bitcoin lags behind money supply by about ten weeks. If that pattern holds, prices could sink by as much as $20,000 in the weeks after president Donald Trump’s inauguration. Analysts are pointing to Bitcoin’s current phase as a mid-top correction—a pattern seen before in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Those phases led to monster bull runs, but first came the pain. And it looks like this one could sting, especially with predictions that even before inauguration, Bitcoin might drop 30%. Panic selling hits markets and Bitcoin ETFs bleed out Panic is spreading beyond crypto. U.S. equity funds just posted outflows of $50.2 billion in the week ending December 18. That’s the biggest exodus since 2009. Large-cap funds lost $20.9 billion, wiping out six weeks of gains. Small-cap, multi-cap, and mid-cap funds weren’t spared either, losing $5.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $2.9 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, the volatility index ($VIX) just posted its second-largest daily jump in history. The market is on edge, and Bitcoin’s caught in the middle of it. Leveraged long positions in Bitcoin got crushed, pushing prices down to $92,000 by mid-December. The weekend gave bulls a little breathing room, with a rebound to $99,500 on Bitstamp. Coinbase buyers tried to claw prices back to six figures, but institutional players staying on the sidelines made the recovery look shaky. The optimism didn’t last. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) felt the heat too. December 20 brought nearly $300 million in net outflows from U.S. Bitcoin ETFs . The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) took the hardest hit, logging its largest-ever outflow at $72.7 million. Investors are bailing, and fast.

Internet Computer ($ICP) and Altura ($ALU) have emerged as prominent contenders, each offering unique value propositions. However, when it comes to explosive growth potential and the chance to achieve a 10x (or higher) return, Altura ($ALU) stands out as the more compelling choice. Here's why: Market Cap Comparison: $ICP vs $ALU One of the most critical factors when evaluating a cryptocurrency's growth potential is its market capitalization. Internet Computer ($ICP) Currently sits at a market cap of approximately $4.7 billion. While this reflects its established position and robust infrastructure, it also means that significant growth is harder to achieve. With a market cap of this size, a 10x return would require $ICP to climb to a staggering $47 billion—an ambitious target given current market conditions. More realistically, $ICP offers a 2-3x growth potential over the short to medium term. Altura ($ALU) Boasts a modest market cap of just $98 million. This low market cap positions $ALU as a prime candidate for explosive growth. A 10x return would elevate its market cap to $980 million, a far more achievable milestone in the current crypto landscape. Furthermore, given its innovative features, $ALU could potentially deliver a 15x to 20x return, taking its market cap to $1.5-$2 billion—a figure that aligns with other successful mid-cap cryptocurrencies. AI Integration from the Altura Project: A Unique Selling Point One of the most intriguing aspects of Altura is its clever utilization of AI. The platform has integrated AI in order to transform how blockchain and smart NFTs interface with the user. This advanced technology places Altura at the forefront of its market segment, and so is attractive to both developers and end users. Key Benefits of Altura' s AI Integration ① Smarter NFTs: Altura uses AI to create intelligent NFTs that can respond to specific triggers or user actions, thus enabling totally unprecedented applications in gaming, virtual economies, and beyond. ② Enhanced User Experience: AI-powered tools make it easier for developers to make, store, and use NFTs, reducing technical obstacles to using them. ③ Future-oriented technology: By embedding AI into its system, Altura makes it more likely that this will remain a scalable platform that remains relevant into the future along with developing technology. Why Altura ($ALU) Might Outperform $ICP 1. Market Capital Growth Prospects As was mentioned earlier, Altura’s low market capitalization provides plenty of room for exponential benefit. There is going to be exponential growth in AI-powered demand for smarter NFTs and blockchain solutions, and in this trend, Altura is well positioned. 2. Niche Strategy Internet Computer is highly competitive, with the giants of Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot. While it is working to build a decentralized version of the Internet, Altura has carved out a unique niche for itself with AI-enhanced NFT technology. This strategy makes Altura distinctive and less directly competitive than those of other companies vying for the top spots in that market. 3. Community and Developer Allies Altura is being used by developers and followers excited that it can shake up the NFT space. Grassroots involvement can often act as an impetus for organic development and market self-confidence. 4. High Return Potential The market cap difference alone makes Altura a more attractive option for those who want high returns. With a realistic path to 10x and the chance of 15x or even 20x, $ALU returns a better risk-to-reward ratio than $ICP. Conclusion : Altura ($ALU) Has the Edge While Internet Computer ($ICP) is a solid investment for those seeking stability and moderate growth, Altura ($ALU) shines as the clear choice for investors aiming for explosive returns. Its low market cap, combined with groundbreaking AI integration, positions it as one of the most promising projects in the crypto space. If you're looking for a cryptocurrency with the potential to multiply your investment tenfold or more, Altura's innovative approach and untapped market cap make it a strong contender. As always, conduct your research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions—but keep a close eye on Altura ($ALU) as a rising star in the crypto world.

From the playful antics of Dogecoin to the explosive growth of Shiba Inu, these quirky cryptocurrencies have captivated investors across the globe. As the market becomes more saturated with meme coins, new projects like BTFD Coin , Goatseus Maximus, and Cat in a Dog’s World are rising to the challenge, offering fresh investment opportunities for 2025. With trends indicating an increased focus on gaming, community engagement, and innovative tokenomics, these projects have the potential to outshine their predecessors. Let’s dive into why these three meme coins are the ones to keep an eye on in 2025. Meme coins like BTFD Coin are set to take advantage of market dips and make the most of the opportunities hidden in the chaos. With the presale performance of BTFD Coin already exceeding $4.2 million and projections predicting huge growth, there’s never been a better time to join the ride. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , a referral program, staking rewards, and a robust community-driven ecosystem, BTFD Coin is positioning itself to dominate the meme coin market in 2025. Investors who recognise the power of community-driven projects and the potential for long-term growth should pay close attention to this coin’s presale performance. With each stage of the presale seeing a surge in funds raised, BTFD Coin is rapidly becoming a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin of the Moment BTFD Coin has already shown impressive performance during its presale, surpassing $4.2 million in total funds raised and selling over 57 billion coins to more than 6,100 holders. It’s safe to say that BTFD Coin is making waves in the meme coin market, and with good reason. The meme coin’s value proposition goes far beyond its meme status. BTFD Coin is poised to lead the charge in 2025 with its innovative approach to community engagement, Play-to-Earn gaming, and staking rewards. The presale started at a low price of $0.000004 per coin, but BTFD Coin has steadily climbed through its presale stages. As of Stage 12, the price sits at $0.00013, offering an impressive 361.5% ROI. The presale will last a total of 16 stages, with the coin expected to list at $0.0006 after it concludes. Analysts predict significant price gains, making BTFD Coin one of the top meme coins to buy and hold for 2025. But it’s not just the price that makes BTFD Coin a standout. The community is at the heart of its success, with its referral program, P2E game, and staking rewards designed to keep investors engaged and incentivised. These features create a sense of community and ownership, driving up demand for the token. When you buy and hold BTFD Coin, you’re not just holding a meme coin – you’re part of a movement. The current price of $0.00013 presents a golden opportunity for investors looking to maximise their returns. Take, for example, an investment of $2,000 at the Stage 12 price. At $0.00013 per coin, you would purchase approximately 15.38 million coins. If the price reaches $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your $2,000 investment would be worth a whopping $9,229. That’s a staggering 361.5% return on investment – a compelling reason to consider BTFD Coin as one of the top meme coins to buy and hold for 2025. Goatseus Maximus: A Meme Coin with a Unique Twist Goatseus Maximus is another meme coin that’s quickly gaining traction in the crypto community. While it may not have the same level of name recognition as other meme coins, Goatseus Maximus is carving out its niche with a unique approach to meme culture. This coin is designed to be more than just a joke – it’s a way for investors to show their support for community-driven projects while having a bit of fun along the way. The Goatseus Maximus ecosystem focuses heavily on community governance and rewards for long-term holders. The coin operates with a deflationary model, meaning that every transaction includes a small burn, reducing the total supply over time and increasing scarcity. This creates the potential for long-term price appreciation, making it an attractive investment for those who are looking for meme coins with solid fundamentals. What sets Goatseus Maximus apart is its commitment to building a strong community around the coin. With active social media campaigns, partnerships with meme influencers, and a dedicated community of holders, Goatseus Maximus has quickly built a loyal following. It’s this community-driven ethos that will likely propel Goatseus Maximus to greater heights in 2025, making it one of the top meme coins to buy and hold. With its deflationary mechanics, strong community backing, and growing recognition, Goatseus Maximus is a meme coin to watch. While it may not have the same widespread appeal as larger coins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, it’s gaining momentum and could see significant growth in the years to come. Cat in a Dog’s World: An Underdog Meme Coin with Potential Cat in a Dog’s World (CDW) is a meme coin that plays on the popular rivalry between cats and dogs, giving it a unique edge in a crowded market. While it’s still in its early stages, CDW has already shown potential for long-term growth. The coin’s developers have focused on building a token that’s not only fun but also functional, with a roadmap that includes partnerships, community-driven initiatives, and charity events. One of the standout features of CDW is its focus on utility. Unlike other meme coins that may rely solely on hype, CDW is positioning itself as a meme coin with real-world value. Its upcoming partnerships with e-commerce platforms, alongside its charity initiatives, will help solidify its place in the meme coin ecosystem. The coin’s loyal following and meme-inspired branding create a strong sense of community, which is essential for driving growth and adoption. The Cat in a Dog’s World project plans to release new products and services that will integrate CDW into various use cases, making it more than just a token for speculative trading. For investors looking for meme coins that balance fun with long-term value, CDW offers an intriguing opportunity. While it may not have the same immediate appeal as more established meme coins, its growing community and functional approach could make it a top meme coin to buy and hold for 2025. Conclusion: Why BTFD Coin is the Top Meme Coin to Buy and Hold for 2025 Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as one of the top meme coins to buy and hold for 2025. With its impressive presale performance, strong community support, and innovative features like its P2E game and staking rewards, BTFD Coin is set to make a significant impact in the meme coin market. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto investor or a newcomer looking for a fun and profitable opportunity, BTFD Coin offers a unique blend of excitement and potential for massive returns.

Don’t Miss Out on this Best New Meme Coin Presale – Huge ROI Awaits!,"In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, fortunes are made—and missed—in the blink of an eye. Remember when PEPE Coin was just a whisper in the meme coin frenzy? Early adopters who bought in when it was dirt cheap rode the wave to incredible gains. Missing out on that kind of opportunity might still sting, but here’s the good news for you! Now, history is repeating itself, but this time, the opportunity is knocking with the explosive presale of BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With over $4.2 million already raised within a month, this is your chance to catch the next big wave before it’s too late. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin—short for “Buy the Dip”—has flipped the script on meme coins. This isn’t just another project riding the hype train; it’s a community-powered movement that embodies resilience and strategy. Built on Ethereum, BTFD combines robust tokenomics with real-world utility, offering staking rewards, a P2E (Play-to-Earn) game, and a referral program that’s already turning heads. Since its presale launch, BTFD has been a whirlwind success. It smashed through milestones, raising $1 million in under 10 days and $2.5 million within 14 days. Over 57 billion tokens have been sold to 6,100+ holders, and the presale is now in its 12th stage. The cherry on top? The beta version of its P2E game, which went live in Stage 10, is already creating a buzz. While rewards aren’t yet live in the beta, it’s a taste of what’s to come. Coupled with a 90% APY staking program that launched on December 2, and a robust referral program, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s the future of meme investing. Analysts are calling it one of the Best New Meme Coin Presales of the year, and with features like these, it’s not hard to see why: Staking Rewards : Enjoy a staggering 90% APY by staking your BTFD tokens . Play-to-Earn Game: Engage with the Bulls Squad and earn rewards while having fun. Referral Programme: Earn 10% on every purchase made using your referral code. PEPE Coin: The One That Got Away PEPE Coin—named after the iconic internet meme—was a phenomenon. Launched in early 2023, it skyrocketed to fame almost overnight. Early investors turned a few hundred dollars into tens of thousands, but as with any crypto boom, the window of opportunity didn’t stay open for long. Today, PEPE still holds a prominent place in the meme coin universe. Its trading volume recently hit $2.2 billion, dwarfing other competitors like Shiba Inu. However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. After invalidating its bullish wedge pattern and dropping below its ascending trendline, PEPE is currently trading at $0.00002117, its lowest since early December. Analysts warn that unless PEPE breaks through key resistance levels, its short-term outlook remains shaky. This bearish turn might feel like a missed opportunity for some. Yet, those who got in early and cashed out at the peak—when PEPE briefly touched $0.00002833—know just how lucrative meme coins can be. For the rest, it’s a lesson: the next big chance is always around the corner, and missing it could mean watching others get rich while you’re left in the dust. Don’t Miss Out—Again!

The IMF announced on Dec. 18 that El Salvador would receive $1.4 billion over 40 months to lower its debt-to-GDP ratio. “The potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund policies. Legal reforms will make acceptance of Bitcoin by the private sector voluntary,” the IMF stated. “For the public sector, engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of Bitcoin will be confined.” Additionally, taxes will continue to be paid in U.S. dollars — El Salvador’s official currency — and government involvement in the Chivo wallet will be gradually phased out. El Salvador began purchasing Bitcoin in 2021 and currently holds 5,968.8 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $602 million, according to the National Bitcoin Office. A spokesperson from the office told Cointelegraph that the country will continue its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. “We will keep buying one Bitcoin a day (likely even more in the future), and we will not sell any of our current holdings,” the spokesperson stated. “The plans for the Bitcoin Office remain the same as Bitcoin continues to be our main strategy.” The agreement, still pending approval from the IMF Executive Board, concludes four years of negotiations following President Nayib Bukele’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021, making El Salvador the first country to do so. The IMF has consistently urged Bukele to abandon Bitcoin, citing its speculative nature as a potential risk to the country. The deal will also unlock additional loans, including from the World Bank, for a total financing package exceeding $3.5 billion. Reacting to the announcement, Bukele’s Bitcoin adviser Max Keiser dismissed the IMF’s stance, stating on X, “Nobody pays attention to these assh****,” and labeled the agreement “bureaucratic, meaningless nonsense.” Keiser added, “Bitcoin use in El Salvador was always voluntary, and its usage has never been higher and continues to grow.” However, a recent survey revealed that 92% of Salvadorans do not use Bitcoin for transactions, up from 88% in 2023.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/el-salvador-adjusts-bitcoin-policy-in-1-4-billion-imf-deal/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Ripple whales, famous for their mastery of market timing, have set their sights on an explosive AI-powered token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) . While the XRP price and the Ethereum price have historically dominated the market, WallitIQ (WLTQ) promises to deliver performance that could leave these established giants in the dust by 2025. This innovative project is already attracting forward-thinking investors seeking high returns. Ripple Whales Sets Investors’ Eyes On WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Growth Potential For years, crypto giants like the XRP price and the more established Ethereum price have had the attention of Ripple whales and other crypto enthusiasts. For some investors, the fond memories of trading the Ethereum price and the XRP price continue to influence their investment decisions. However, Ripple whales are famous for sniffing out profitable opportunities without emotional attachments to past loves. At this crucial juncture, Ripple whales have shifted their focus to endorsing WallitIQ (WLTQ) instead of the XRP price. The Ripple whales have recognized that the future of cryptocurrency is moving toward niches like AI and gaming, positioning an AI-powered token like WallitIQ (WLTQ) to potentially outperform both the Ethereum price and the XRP price. Additionally, concerns have arisen regarding centralization following the Ethereum price transition to Proof of Stake, thus dampening investors’ confidence. To this end, a few large entities controlling the validator network could lead to centralization, undermining the Ethereum price credibility and alienating users who prioritize decentralization. As a result, it is reasonable for Ripple whales to lean toward the WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI-powered token while still holding on to some of the XRP price tokens. Speaking on the AI-powered token, investors can earn a 180% APY on staked tokens, have access to trade more than 1,500 crypto tokens from their wallets and benefit from a 20% tokenomics allocation for community incentives with WallitIQ (WLTQ). For keen investors, however, the opportunity to become a crypto millionaire is merely a step away. This opportunity comes from buying WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI-powered token at just $0.0243. In this competition, fortune may favor the bold, but those who act quickly could enjoy even greater rewards. Therefore, savvy investors must act quickly to purchase a share of the 30% remaining WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI-powered tokens during the ongoing presale stage before they sell out in a few days. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Revolutionizes Crypto Trading With Advanced AI Features Gaining recognition as an AI-powered token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out for its integration of artificial intelligence into DeFi. With its AI smart suggestions feature , WallitIQ (WLTQ) gives investors real-time recommendations on when, what, and how to execute trades to stay profitable. Additionally, the platform uses artificial intelligence to forecast future price movements with its predictive analytics technology .This way, investors are prepared for shifts in market dynamics before they occur, allowing them to take advantage before others get to know them. Many newcomers to crypto appreciate the educational materials offered by WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) team. By utilizing these resources, investors can quickly deepen their understanding of decentralized finance and implement sophisticated strategies. In addition to these features, WallitIQ (WLTQ) employs robust security measures. The team spared no expense in hiring a leading smart contract auditing firm, SolidProof , to audit its smart contract. This critical step has encouraged significant purchases of the AI-powered token, boosting its successful presale. Conclusion Movements among Ripple whales rarely go unnoticed, and this particular shift signifies an upcoming evolution in the crypto space. With most Ripple whales pivoting toward this AI-powered token, the message is clear: the altcoin is poised to outperform the XRP price, and the Ethereum price has emerged. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is where the momentum is building. Those who hesitate as the tides shift may find themselves left behind. Only the bold investors who buy at $0.0243 before the window closes will reap the rewards. So hurry up and join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale movement.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK.

Investors who had accounts with Cryptopia – a New Zealand-based crypto firm that collapsed in May 2019 – will collectively receive $225 million worth of digital assets, according to a new press release by accounting firm Grant Thornton. “The liquidators of Cryptopia are pleased to announce a significant milestone in the ongoing liquidation process. Over the past two days, more than 10,000 verified account holders of Bitcoin and Dogecoin have received their first cryptocurrency distributions. Within the last 48 hours, over $400 million NZD ($225 million USD) in cryptocurrency has been returned on-chain.” Cryptopia was initially hacked in January 2019 when bad actors stole millions of dollars worth of digital assets. Months later in May, the company decided it would be in the “best interests of customers, staff and other stakeholders” to appoint liquidators. Said David Ruscoe, a Grant Thornton liquidator assigned to Cryptopia, “We realize Cryptopia’s customers will want to have this matter resolved as soon as possible. We will conduct a thorough investigation, working with several different stakeholders including management and shareholders, to find the solution that is in the best interests of customers and stakeholders.” According to the press release, the liquidators have worked to ensure the crypto distributions were consistent with a judge’s 2020 ruling that digital assets were property in the context of liquidations.

37934588,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375442,1734809789,Chinese Auto Dealer Dives Into Bitcoin Mining With $256M Investment,"Shanghai-based car dealership Cango Inc. has pivoted to Bitcoin (BTC) mining, announcing a $256 million acquisition of 32 exahashes per second (EH/s) in hashrate from Bitmain Technologies. In November, the company extracted 363 BTC, worth about $36 million, without liquidating any assets, positioning it as one of the top players in the global Bitcoin mining industry. Cango Joins BTC Mining Bigwigs According to The MinerMag, the move makes Cango the fifth-largest public Bitcoin miner by realized hashrate and the third-biggest by deployed hashrate. Its production accounts for 4% of the BTC mined daily around the world, a major achievement given the firm only recently entered the sector. Cango’s expansion into BTC mining is backed by strategic acquisitions. The initial purchase from Bitmain, including on-rack miners, is reportedly hosted in the U.S., possibly in Georgia, under an 18-month colocation agreement. Such a contract allows the company to house its hardware with a service provider in a secure and managed environment without the need to maintain its own data centers. This is especially important given that crypto mining was officially prohibited in China in May 2021 due to concerns about financial risk, energy consumption, and environmental impact. Interestingly, even with the ban, Chinese mining pools still control a huge chunk of the global BTC hashrate, estimated by some experts to be around 55%. Cango also plans to secure another 18 EH/s from Golden TechGen, a company owned by ex-Bitmain CFO Max Hua. The deal, expected to be finalized by the end of March 2025, is said to involve the issuing of $144 million in common stock, potentially bringing the NYSE-listed motor dealership’s total hashrate to 50 EH/s. This would allow Cango to potentially match industry leaders such as Marathon Digital Holdings . Speculation is rife that the hardware in question will include Bitmain’s Antminer S19XP rigs, bought at a relatively competitive $8 per terahash per second (TH/s). Bitcoin Bet Pays Off With BTC prices hovering around the $100,000 level and the network hashprice rebounding to $63 per petahash per second (PH/s), Cango’s venture into crypto appears well-timed. While it also marks a dramatic shift from the company’s origins as an automotive transaction service provider, it is in keeping with the firm’s constant reinvention of itself. Founded in 2010, it initially focused on motor vehicle financing before moving into car trading due to regulatory pressures in China. Earlier in the year, it diversified its operations further, launching AutoCango.com, a platform offering used Chinese cars to buyers worldwide. However, Cango has acknowledged that its new BTC mining operation may dominate its revenue streams in the near term, especially given that its initial income from the venture surpassed its Q3 revenue of $3.84 million many times over. The performance pushed the company’s stock price from $3.41 to $6.91, boosting its market cap to $500 million.

This decline adds to the token’s steep price movement after it reached a new all-time high of $263.83 following the US Presidential elections in November.

Related Reading: Solana Holds Monthly Support As Network Activity Grows – Time For A Breakout? More Room For SOL Price Growth, Analysts Say In a recent blog post on December 20, Glassnode in collaboration with crypto analysts UkuriaOC and CryptoVizArt shared vital insights on the current state of the Solana market. By analyzing the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, these market experts discovered that Solana has experienced a positive net capital inflow since early September 2023, with a recorded peak inflow of $776 million of new capital per day. During this period, the SOL market witnessed minor inflows with the majority of the profit-taking volume coming from coins aged 1 day-1 week, 1 week-1 month, and 6 months-12 months, demonstrating the endearment of Solana to both long and short-term holders. To ascertain the status of Solana amidst these recent market activity, Glassnode employs the MVRV ratio to determine if the market is overheated. For context, the Market Value To Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is used to assess if an asset is potentially overvalued (>1) or undervalued (<1). This MVRV ratio can be used to establish pricing bands that classify investors’ profitability into ranges. Using this setup, Glassnode observes that Solana is currently observing a sideways movement between the mean MVRV and +0.5 standard deviation range. This development indicates the Solana market is quite heated but still far from a bull cycle top. This is because MVRV breakouts of +1 standard deviation have historically signaled when the altcoin forms a longer-term macro topping formation. Therefore, Solana still has the potential to record much profit before entering an overheated zone that will likely precede a market downtrend.

Following its price crash to $9.64 in November 2022, Solana has experienced a remarkable price gain of over 2,143% over the past two years. During this period, the altcoin has outperformed both Bitcoin and Ethereum on 344 out of 727 market days since the FTX exchange collapsed indicating significant market demand and interest. At the time of writing, Solana trades at $194.58 reflecting a price loss of 0.50% in the past day. However, the asset’s trading volume is up by 18.94% and is valued at $9.94 billion.

In a recent X post, Rich Dad, Poor spoke candidly about his mistrust of the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve, and the soaring national debt. With his decades of financial experience, he predicted a devastating economic collapse. He urged individuals to protect their wealth by shifting focus to alternative assets like Bitcoin (BTC), gold, and silver. A History of Distrust: From Nixon to Bitcoin Kiyosaki’s distrust of U.S. financial policy began in 1965. This was after he noticed that U.S. coins were no longer made of silver but a mix of copper and other metals. His concerns deepened in 1971 when President Nixon removed the U.S. dollar from the gold standard. This means the currency was no longer backed by real gold. This made Kiyosaki realize the financial system was becoming unstable. This led him to focus on tangible assets like gold and silver, which retain value regardless of economic changes. In a recent report, Kiyosaki said he currently holds 73 BTC and plans to increase it to 100 BTC within the next year. Today, Kiyosaki believes that Bitcoin and gold and silver are the best way to protect wealth. The Coming Crash: A Global Financial Meltdown Kiyosaki believes the global financial system is near collapse and warned that the upcoming crash could be the largest in history. He predicted that traditional assets tied to fiat currencies, like stocks and bonds, could lose value during the crisis. To protect wealth, he advised investing in assets with real value, like Bitcoin. Earlier this year, he encouraged followers to buy Bitcoin in small amounts called Satoshis. This was when the asset’s price was over $106,000, which later reached above $108,000. This week, Bitcoin dropped to $92,640 after news of reduced support from the Federal Reserve. However, it has since recovered by nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, reaching $96,812 as per CoinMarketCap data. Despite the sharp decline in Bitcoin’s price, Kiyosaki remains confident in the asset’s long-term potential. Bitcoin: The Future of Wealth Kiyosaki has always supported Bitcoin, especially as the adoption of digital assets is widespread. He believes that Bitcoin’s value could rise to $350,000 in the coming years. This is largely due to Donald Trump’s expected leadership. Trump’s administration promises to focus on supporting crypto and plans to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In late November, Bitcoin advocate and MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor predicted that Bitcoin could reach $13 million in the coming years.

With new opportunities emerging every day, the key to success lies in selecting projects that combine cutting-edge utility, growth potential, and investor confidence. Right now, Qubetics ($TICS), Binance Coin (BNB), and Polygon (MATIC) are making headlines as must-watch projects for savvy investors. Qubetics, the rising star of 2024, offers transformative features and unprecedented ROI projections. Meanwhile, Binance and Polygon continue to lead with their established ecosystems, ensuring steady performance for businesses and individuals alike. Let’s dive into why these three cryptos are among the best coins to buy this week. Qubetics ($TICS): Unparalleled Growth and Privacy Innovation Qubetics is a blockchain project redefining decentralisation with unmatched growth potential. Currently in its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has already secured incredible milestones—over 365 million $TICS tokens sold to more than 11,100 holders, raising an impressive $7.4 million. With the token priced at just $0.0342, investors are eyeing explosive returns post-presale. Qubetics’ decentralised VPN (dVPN) is one of its standout features. This solution allows businesses and individuals to navigate the internet securely without centralised control, giving them full ownership of their online privacy. Consider a real estate entrepreneur working with international partners. Instead of risking exposure through standard VPNs, Qubetics’ dVPN ensures secure access to confidential data and sensitive contracts. Likewise, professionals like doctors or lawyers handling private client information can rely on Qubetics’ dVPN for absolute privacy. For everyday users, it provides protection while accessing global platforms, streaming content, or conducting financial transactions. Qubetics has analysts buzzing with bold predictions. A $0.25 price at presale end translates into over 630.19% ROI. Looking long-term, $TICS could skyrocket to $5 or $10 after the mainnet launch, delivering 14,503.91% to 29,107.82% ROI. For investors who jump in now, the opportunities are staggering. Imagine investing $50,000 at the current price of $0.0342. If $TICS reaches $1, that translates to over $1.4 million—a life-changing return. With its dVPN feature and future-ready approach, Qubetics is undeniably one of the best coins to buy this week . Binance Coin (BNB): The Backbone of the Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the Binance exchange, is one of the most valuable altcoins in the crypto market. Serving as the backbone of the Binance ecosystem, BNB fuels various services, including trading fee discounts, staking, and payment solutions. Binance remains the largest crypto exchange globally, attracting millions of traders and institutional investors. As more users engage with the platform, demand for BNB continues to grow. Beyond its exchange utility, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has become a haven for decentralised finance (DeFi) and blockchain projects, offering scalability and lower transaction costs. Binance’s dominance in the market, combined with its expanding ecosystem, ensures that BNB remains one of the best coins to buy this week for stability and sustained growth. Polygon (MATIC): Solving Ethereum’s Scalability Challenges Polygon (MATIC) has emerged as the go-to Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, solving critical challenges like high gas fees and network congestion. By providing a scalable and fast blockchain infrastructure, Polygon has become the preferred choice for decentralised applications (dApps) and developers. Polygon’s ability to support low-cost transactions has made it popular in industries like gaming, NFTs, and decentralised finance. For example, developers creating blockchain-based games can rely on Polygon to deliver seamless user experiences without expensive transaction fees. Similarly, businesses exploring tokenisation of assets or real estate benefit from Polygon’s speed and cost efficiency. From an investor perspective, MATIC’s consistent performance and growing adoption place it firmly among the best coins to buy this week . Its integration with Ethereum gives it a strong foundation, and with more projects moving to Layer 2 solutions, MATIC’s future remains bright. Conclusion: The Best Coins to Buy This Week Qubetics ($TICS) , Binance Coin (BNB), and Polygon (MATIC) are leading the charge as the best coins to buy this week. While Binance and Polygon provide proven stability through their established ecosystems, Qubetics is the real showstopper with its transformative dVPN feature and explosive ROI potential. At just $0.0342 per $TICS token, Qubetics offers investors a golden opportunity to secure their financial future. Its multichain connectivity and privacy-focused technology are solutions that businesses and individuals desperately need.

PEPE offers a no-tax policy and is transparent about its lack of utility, embracing its role purely as a memecoin. In April to May 2023, PEPE's market cap surged to $1.6 billion, attracting a strong community and inducing a ""memecoin season."" With its roadmap targeting major exchange listings and increased visibility, PEPE may appeal to investors looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities in the current market cycle.

37934680,https://invezz.com/?p=2399022,1734807848,Top 3 cryptocurrencies to buy for 5x gains by January 2025,"As 2024 comes to an end, crypto investors are realigning their investments targeting top cryptocurrencies to buy for significant gains by January 2025. The urge stems from the renewed optimism around cryptocurrencies with the incoming pro-crypto Donald Trump administration. Best cryptocurrencies to buy for 5x gains As traders seek substantial returns amid the current downturn, three tokens — iDEGEN , Ripple’s XRP, and Ethena (ENA) — stand out as potential frontrunners for exponential gains by January 2025. These cryptocurrencies offer a combination of innovative technology and strong market dynamics that analysts believe could propel their growth over the next month. 1. iDEGEN: The AI memecoin revolutionizing community engagement Launched on November 26, 2024, iDEGEN is more than just a memecoin. It is an AI-powered memecoin that has captivated the crypto community with its dynamic presale model and innovative approach to community engagement. Leveraging artificial intelligence, iDEGEN actively incorporates community feedback from platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to adapt its roadmap. It has already over $7.7 million in its ongoing presale with more than 1.052 billion tokens sold. The presale employs a unique pricing mechanism that adjusts every five minutes, creating an environment that appeals to traders who thrive on volatility. The presale prices increase by 5% after consecutive purchases, decrease by the same margin during inactivity and remain stable if only one purchase occurs within the interval. The presale is scheduled to end on January 1, 2025, with an expected cryptocurrency listing at 10% higher than its final presale price. This anticipation, coupled with its AI-driven features, positions the token as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now. 2. Ripple’s XRP: Analysts predict a rally towards $5.73 Ripple’s XRP remains a key player in the cryptocurrency market, showing resilience and potential for explosive growth despite market fluctuations. Currently trading at $2.26, XRP has demonstrated its ability to rebound, even in the face of bearish signals such as the recent “death cross” on its hourly charts. The token’s price action reveals strong support at $2.20, with analysts predicting a breakout that could target levels between $3.62 and $4.3. A sustained rally might even propel XRP towards $5.73. Technical indicators hint at a bullish divergence, with the Stochastic RSI signalling upward momentum and the Awesome Oscillator suggesting a potential trend reversal. On-chain data further supports this optimism, showing significant accumulation by whales who have bought millions of XRP during the recent dip. For example, blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported a transfer of nearly 100 million XRP worth over $222 million on December 20 with another transfer of 90 million XRP worth over $201 million on December 21, underscoring strong institutional interest. Adding to its bullish narrative, XRP has made strides in technological innovation. In addition to the recently launched RLUSD stablecoin, the XRP Ledger’s Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) recently passed a security audit with zero critical issues, bolstering confidence in its ecosystem. With a solid foundation, strategic adoption by institutions, and technical signals aligning, XRP presents a compelling case for substantial gains by early 2025. 3. Ethena (ENA): A Rising Star Backed by Strategic Partnerships Ethena (ENA) has emerged as a market outperformer, demonstrating resilience and upward momentum despite significant selling pressure from notable investors like Arthur Hayes. Hayes, who previously expressed support for Ethena Labs, sold $8.44 million worth of ENA tokens on December 21.

Analysts like Chill Trader forecast an 85% surge for ENA, citing a bullish Cup-and-Handle pattern with key support at $0.94. According to Chill, if this level holds, ENA could aim for a price target of $2.15, propelled by strong market momentum and strategic developments.

Notably, there is a proposal by Ethena Labs to have sUSDe become a collateral asset for WLF’s market, while BlackRock’s collaboration focuses on risk management strategies, including the launch of the USDtb stablecoin backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund. With a market capitalization of $3.17 billion, Ethena has already established itself as the 43rd largest cryptocurrency and its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) and strong technical setup make it another attractive option for investors looking for the best cryptocurrency to buy for high returns by January 2025.

Solana Nears Support Level, Eyeing Potential Upside Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading between $205.85 and $239.87, approaching its nearest support level at $187.60. The RSI at 37.77 suggests the coin is nearing oversold territory, hinting at a possible rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is below the current price, indicating potential for upward movement. Despite recent declines of nearly 19% over the week and 23% over the month, Solana has gained over 37% in the past six months. If momentum shifts, SOL could test the nearest resistance at $255.64 and possibly reach the second resistance at $289.66, offering significant upside from current levels. Uniswap (UNI) Shows Potential for Growth Amid Altcoin Season Hopes Uniswap's price is currently between $14.40 and $19.33, showing steady movement after recent fluctuations. The 10-day moving average is $12.15, below the 100-day average of $15.15, suggesting possible upward momentum. With the Relative Strength Index at 33.15, UNI appears to be nearing oversold territory, which might indicate a forthcoming rise. Breaking through the nearest resistance at $21.62 could propel the price toward the next level at $26.55, marking a significant percentage gain. Over the past month, UNI has seen a price increase of 25.86%, fueling optimism for continued growth. However, if the price falls below the support at $11.76, it may test the lower level of $6.83. Pepe Coin Shows Signs of Potential Rebound Amid Market Volatility Pepe (PEPE) has experienced notable price fluctuations, currently trading between $0.00002106 and $0.00002779. Over the past week, the coin's price has decreased by 35.07%, and it's down 22.21% for the month. However, looking back six months, PEPE has gained 34.55%. Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 33.01 and a Stochastic value of 18.52, both suggesting that the coin may be oversold. The nearest support level is at $0.00001798, with resistance at $0.00003144. If the price holds above support and gains upward momentum, it could challenge the resistance levels. Market participants are closely monitoring these indicators for potential shifts in the coin's trajectory. Polkadot (DOT) Set to Soar: Bullish Indicators Signal Potential Growth Polkadot (DOT) is showing promising signs for a price surge. Despite a 1-week drop of 28.33%, its 1-month and 6-month gains stand at 11.88% and 13.04% respectively. The current price hovers between $7.48 and $10.47, close to the support level of $5.96. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 37.28, approaching oversold territory, suggesting a potential rebound. If buying momentum increases, DOT could break through the nearest resistance at $11.93 and aim for the next level at $14.92. This would represent a significant percentage rise from current prices. With altcoin season approaching and a bullish crypto market anticipated, Polkadot may be poised for substantial growth soon. Conclusion While SOL, UNI, PEPE, and DOT show less short-term promise, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero. It offers up to 700% ROI during presale, increasing from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages.

37933782,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631337,1734807600,Avoid Selling These 3 Tokens Too Early During Altcoin Season for Maximum Profits,"As altcoin season heats up, savvy investors know that timing is everything to maximize profits. Among the tokens you’ll want to hold onto are innovative projects like Lightchain AI (LCAI) , which is redefining the blockchain space with cutting-edge technology. Featuring its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), LCAI stands out as a game-changer in decentralized AI. Currently priced at just $0.003 in its presale, this token, along with two others, has massive potential for exponential growth during this explosive market phase. Understanding Altcoin Season- Timing Is Everything Altcoin time is a key time in the crypto market, shown by a big rise in the worth of other coins (altcoins) compared to Bitcoin. Timing is all during this time, as figuring out when the season͏ starts and ends can mean the gap between big gains and lost chances. Things like Bitcoin power, market mood, and altcoin news often show when this time begins. People who know these signs can place themselves for best gains. But, quick selling in early price hikes can cause lost profits as altcoins usually have many ups and downs. Calm waiting and smart choice-making are important to take advantage of this changing time. Always look over trends closely to make sure you’re catching the whole wave of possible benefits. Top 3 Tokens to Hold for Maximum Gains While there are numerous altcoins to consider during this season, some stand out as having more potential for significant growth. Among these are Lightchain AI (LCAI), [Polkadot (DOT), and [Chainlink (LINK)]. 1. Lightchain AI (LCAI) As previously mentioned, Lightchain AI is a groundbreaking project that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence. Its advanced technology and unique consensus mechanism make it a top pick for altcoin season. With the presale price of LCAI currently at just $0.003, investors have a prime opportunity to get in on the ground floor before its potential explosion in value. Also, with partnerships in the works and a highly experienced team behind it, LCAI has all the necessary ingredients for success. Holding onto this token during altcoin season could result in impressive returns. 2. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is another promising altcoin, with its interoperable blockchain platform gaining significant traction in the market. Its recent partnership with Chainlink and collaborations with other major players in the industry have further solidified its position as an innovative project to watch out for during altcoin season. 3. Chainlink (LINK) As one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in recent years, Chainlink has consistently shown strong growth potential. With partnerships and integrations with major companies like Google, Oracle, and SWIFT, its decentralized oracle network is poised for even greater success during altcoin season. Lightchain AI (LCAI)- The Hidden Gem You Can’t Overlook Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rapidly emerging as a notable player in the cryptocurrency market, seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its unique features, such as the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), have garnered significant investor interest. The ongoing presale offers LCAI tokens at an accessible price of $0.003, presenting an enticing opportunity for early adopters. Analysts predict substantial growth potential, with some forecasting that LCAI could reach $1 to $5 by the end of 2025, driven by its practical applications and increasing adoption. Why Lightchain AI’s $0.003 Price Is the Ultimate Entry Point Investing in Lightchain AI (LCAI) at its current presale price of $0.003 offers a compelling opportunity for substantial returns. This low entry point allows investors to acquire a significant number of tokens with minimal capital. For instance, a $300 investment would secure 100,000 LCAI tokens. If the token’s value appreciates to $1, this investment could potentially grow to $100,000, representing a remarkable return on investment. In terms of security, Lightchain AI employs a Transparent AI Framework, ensuring that every AI decision-making process is auditable and explainable. This commitment to transparency fosters trust and reliability within the ecosystem. Given its innovative approach and robust security measures, Lightchain AI is a promising investment opportunity that should not be overlooked.

37933783,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631350,1734807600,Analysts predict this emerging altcoin could outperform major cryptocurrencies in 2025,"Analysts predict that Lightchain AI (LCAI) , an emerging altcoin, could outshine major cryptocurrencies by 2025. With its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), LCAI seamlessly merges AI with blockchain, creating a scalable and transparent ecosystem. Currently in its presale phase at just $0.003 per token, LCAI offers early investors a unique opportunity to join a project positioned for explosive growth. This could be the next big leap in decentralized technology and AI innovation. Lightchain AI Game-Changer Among Emerging Altcoins Lightchain AI (LCAI) shines as a new power among fresh altcoins, using top-notch AI and blockchain mix to change how we see shared solutions. Different from old-time coins, LCAI brings smart machine learning with safe, quick smart deal features, letting data checks happen right away and clever automation. With experts thinking big growth for 2025; LCAI is ready to take the lead with its bright way of growing and user-friendly apps. Also, the current Lightchain AI Presale has gained lots of notice, showing how much trust investors have in its change-making ability. With its aim on being green, faster speed, and lower costs for transactions LCAI is not just filling holes in the crypto world but also making new rules for blockchain tech. It’s a real game-changer in altcoin scene! Lightchain AI Key Factors Driving Outperformance Potential in 2025 Lightchain AI (LCAI) is poised to outperform major cryptocurrencies in 2025, driven by several key factors. Advanced Security and Privacy Measures LCAI employs Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and homomorphic encryption to ensure data privacy and secure computations, addressing critical concerns in AI and blockchain integration. Cross-Chain Interoperability Unlike platforms like Solana, which have experienced congestion issues, LCAI supports seamless interactions across multiple blockchains. This interoperability provides unparalleled flexibility for developers, enabling the creation of versatile decentralized applications (dApps). Deflationary Tokenomics LCAI incorporates a deflationary model where a portion of transaction fees is burned, reducing the total token supply over time. This mechanism creates scarcity, potentially driving value appreciation and offering long-term value for investors. Real-World Applications and Partnerships With its focus on practical use cases, LCAI has already secured partnerships with various organizations, including AI startups and universities. These partnerships provide a solid foundation for real-world adoption and further growth potential in 2025. These strategic enhancements position Lightchain AI as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency market, with the potential to surpass established cryptocurrencies by 2025. Comparative Analysis- LCAI vs. Major Cryptocurrencies Lightchain AI (LCAI) distinguishes itself from major cryptocurrencies through its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) and Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms, LCAI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI), rewarding nodes for executing valuable AI computations. This approach enhances network security and contributes to AI advancements. Additionally, LCAI’s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) provides a dedicated computational layer for AI tasks, enabling the development of intelligent decentralized applications (dApps) across various industries. In contrast, platforms like Solana, despite their high transaction speeds, have faced network instability and centralization concerns. LCAI addresses these issues by ensuring seamless cross-chain interoperability and maintaining a decentralized governance model, empowering its community through token-based decision-making. Furthermore, LCAI’s deflationary tokenomics, where a portion of transaction fees is burned, creates scarcity and potential value appreciation over time. These strategic innovations position Lightchain AI as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency market, offering advanced solutions that address the limitations of existing major cryptocurrencies.

Top editors, including the Editor-in-Chief, are fired amid the controversy. Charles Hoskinson questions CoinDesk’s future value, suggesting it has declined due to recent editorial decisions. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has voiced concerns about the future of CoinDesk, suggesting that its value has eroded in the ongoing editorial turmoil. Specifically, CoinDesk finds itself embroiled in controversy following the abrupt dismissal of three top editors, including Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds. The turmoil traces back to a disputed decision by Bullish, CoinDesk’s parent company, to remove an article critical of Tron founder Justin Sun . The Justin Sun Article Removal The CoinDesk editorial turmoil began in late November when CoinDesk published an article about a surreal stunt by Justin Sun, where he purchased and ate a $6.2 million banana art piece on a stage.

The platform is divided into the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts, potentially processing up to 1,000,000 transactions per second. With the introduction of native tokens in March 2021, Cardano offers secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/daddy-pepe-daddpepe-will-explode-over-11000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The first-mover advantage is key here – get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! >>Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! XRP (XRP) XRP is a digital currency supported by the XRP Ledger. It's designed to be fast, low-cost, and open, making transactions across borders quick and easy. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion coins. They gifted 80 billion to Ripple, a company aiming to enhance global payments. Ripple, originally called OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to boost network liquidity and support the ecosystem. To manage the coin's supply, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow. The name XRP comes from ""ripple credits,"" highlighting its goal to make moving money as simple as sending information. In today's crypto market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency. Transactions are processed in seconds without the need for a bank account, setting it apart from coins like Bitcoin, which can be slower and more expensive to transfer. XRP's technology focuses on real-world applications, especially in cross-border payments. While the market can be unpredictable, XRP's features and Ripple's efforts to build partnerships might make it appealing to investors. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, XRP could be a strong contender in the push toward faster, more efficient digital transactions. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, known as SHIB, is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke but turned into something more. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator called Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many applications in the Ethereum world. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens! To build trust, half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated a large amount of SHIB to India's COVID relief fund and then ""burned"" 40% of the total supply. These actions put SHIB in the spotlight. Unlike other meme coins like Dogecoin, SHIB aims to be more than just a joke. Because it operates on Ethereum, it can do more interesting things. For example, SHIB has its own exchange called ShibaSwap. There are also plans for a platform for NFTs (digital art) and a system where users can vote on changes. This means SHIB could have real uses in the future. In today's market, where people look for coins with real potential, SHIB might be an attractive choice. Its plans and technology could help it stand out in the crowded crypto space.

Trump's Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum's price has seen notable fluctuations recently. In the past week, ETH has dropped by 10.38%, indicating a short-term bearish trend. However, over the last month, the cryptocurrency has risen by 7.05%, showing signs of recovery. Looking at the six-month timeframe, ETH has experienced a slight decline of 2.34%, reflecting overall market volatility. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $3,648.43 and $4,137.17. The nearest resistance level is at $4,317.86, while the closest support is at $3,340.38. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 20.60, suggesting that ETH is oversold and may be due for a rebound. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $3,622.00, which is below the 100-day average of $3,869.08, indicating a potential shift in momentum. If Ethereum manages to break above the resistance at $4,317.86, it could aim for the next target at $4,806.60, representing a possible increase of around 16%. On the downside, falling below the support at $3,340.38 might lead to a drop towards $2,851.64, which would be a decrease of approximately 22%. Traders are watching these key levels closely to gauge Ethereum's next move. Conclusion Though ETH, PEPE, and MOG show promise, XYZVerse's unique sports-meme blend may dominate the meme coin space in the 2024 bull run.

This community-centered ecosystem is the perfect playground for crypto degens and sports fans alike. Think back to Polymarket's $1 billion trading volume during the US elections betting frenzy, and now, picture that on steroids with XYZVerse. With millions of sport bettors getting ready to jump in the action, opportunities for early investors in XYZ are really huge! XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has transformed the blockchain world since its launch in 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps). Unlike some others, Ethereum now uses Proof-of-Stake, making it more energy-efficient. It also brought us ERC-20 tokens, which many projects use for various purposes like governance and utility. With solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, Ethereum is tackling speed and cost issues, making transactions smoother and cheaper for everyone. In the current market, Ethereum shines due to its constant innovation. The recent shift to Proof-of-Stake with the ""Merge"" in 2022 was a big step forward. Upcoming upgrades like sharding aim to boost scalability and cut costs even more. While new coins come and go, few match Ethereum's strong community and active development. Its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the broader crypto ecosystem makes it a key player. As trends evolve, Ethereum's commitment to improvement and decentralization could make it an attractive choice for those looking into cryptocurrencies. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It's a flexible platform designed for smart contracts, which means developers can build decentralized apps, tokens, and games on it. What sets Cardano apart is its focus on sustainability and scalability. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, Cardano uses a more energy-efficient system called proof-of-stake. This makes it kinder to the environment. ADA is Cardano's native cryptocurrency, and it's giving Ethereum's ETH a run for its money. Users can store value, make payments, and even earn rewards by staking ADA on the network. Cardano's unique two-layer system boosts its transaction speed, potentially handling up to a million transactions per second. With these features, ADA is becoming an interesting player in the current market. As more people seek eco-friendly and efficient crypto options, Cardano's ADA is gaining attention in the crypto community. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a light-hearted take on cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. There's no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. What started as a joke quickly gained traction. In 2021, Dogecoin's value skyrocketed, landing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin's rise highlights the power of community and the influence of social media on financial markets. But is Dogecoin a good investment now? Its abundant supply means it's less scarce than other coins, which can affect its value. Unlike some cryptocurrencies that offer advanced features like smart contracts, Dogecoin's technology is simpler. However, its strong community and widespread recognition give it staying power. The crypto market is highly volatile, and trends can shift quickly. While Dogecoin doesn't offer the technological innovation of coins like Ethereum, its popularity could drive future growth. If you're considering entering the crypto market, Dogecoin remains a risky but intriguing option worth watching. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, known as SHIB, is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke but turned into something more. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator called Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many applications in the Ethereum world. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens! To build trust, half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated a large amount of SHIB to India's COVID relief fund and then ""burned"" 40% of the total supply. These actions put SHIB in the spotlight. Unlike other meme coins like Dogecoin, SHIB aims to be more than just a joke. Because it operates on Ethereum, it can do more interesting things. For example, SHIB has its own exchange called ShibaSwap. There are also plans for a platform for NFTs (digital art) and a system where users can vote on changes. This means SHIB could have real uses in the future. In today's market, where people look for coins with real potential, SHIB might be an attractive choice. Its plans and technology could help it stand out in the crowded crypto space. Conclusion While ETH, ADA, DOGE, and SHIB show promise in the 2024 bull run, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends meme culture and sports, aiming for significant growth with its community-driven ecosystem.

Sophgo, co-founded by Micree Zhan, who also founded the world’s largest Bitcoin miner and chipmaker Bitmain, is under scrutiny over its alleged links to Huawei’s Ascend 910B multi-chip system. The chip in Huawei’s processor reportedly matches one Sophgo ordered from TSMC, further fueling concerns.

Considering market trends, platforms like Sui that prioritize both innovation and user experience may attract more attention. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum that pays tribute to the famous Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. It's a deflationary memecoin with a catchy theme and a straightforward approach. Unlike other complicated projects, PEPE embraces its meme roots and keeps things pure and simple. There's no utility promised, and the team is upfront about it. They appeal to the crypto community by having no transaction taxes and focusing purely on being a fun and engaging token. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw an explosive surge that pushed its market cap to a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive gains, turning some into millionaires overnight. This surge sparked what many call a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme-based tokens experiencing wild price swings. PEPE's roadmap includes plans to get listed on major exchanges and aims for a ""meme takeover."" While it's uncertain if PEPE and other memecoins will reach new highs, many in the crypto community are hopeful, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. In a market where memes can drive value, PEPE stands out as an attractive coin for those looking to ride the next big wave.

Dogwifhat (WIF) WIF has experienced significant fluctuations recently, with its price ranging between $2.38 and $3.52. In the past week, the coin's value dropped by 31.03%, and over the last month, it declined by 39.02%. Despite these short-term decreases, WIF has shown resilience over the past six months, gaining 19.71%, which suggests potential for long-term growth. The technical indicators hint at possible future movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 28.61, indicating that the coin is currently oversold and might be poised for a rebound. The price is approaching a key support level at $1.91. If this support holds, WIF could bounce back toward the nearest resistance at $4.19, representing a substantial increase from current levels. Moving averages also provide insights into WIF's trend. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.24, while the 100-day SMA is $2.62. A crossover could signal a shift in momentum. Additionally, the MACD level is at -0.0740, suggesting that bearish momentum may be waning. Traders are watching to see if WIF will rally or if it will test the second support level at $0.7749. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced notable price changes recently. In the past week, its price fell by 18.86%, marking a significant short-term decline. However, over the past month, AVAX gained 10.91%, indicating a positive trend. Looking at the last six months, the price increased by 43.24%, demonstrating substantial growth in the medium term. The current price ranges from $42.59 to $57.15. The nearest resistance level is $63.55, while the nearest support is at $34.42. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 27.18, suggesting that the token is oversold and may be due for a rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $41.95, which is below the 100-day SMA of $47.35, hinting at potential upward movement. If AVAX breaks through the resistance at $63.55, it could target the next level at $78.12, representing a significant increase. Based on these indicators, AVAX may be set for a price rise. The oversold RSI and stochastic levels point to a possible upward correction. If the price holds above the support at $34.42 and gains momentum, it might reach higher resistance levels. The MACD level of -1.1796 also suggests potential for a trend reversal. Overall, the data points to growth potential for AVAX in the near future.

Cardano (ADA): A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform known for its focus on sustainability, scalability, and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for value storage, payments, and staking. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake model called Ouroboros. The platform is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design improves speed and scalability. Cardano supports decentralized finance apps, token creation, and games, making it a competitor to Ethereum. Its unique setup allows secure and low-fee interactions. With high transaction potential and an environmentally friendly approach, ADA remains a strong contender in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Its technological advancements make it an appealing option in the current cycle. Dogecoin: A Meme-Based Cryptocurrency with Growing Popularity Dogecoin, launched in 2013, uses a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a playful take on cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no limit on supply, with 10,000 coins mined per minute. Initially dismissed as a joke, its popularity soared in 2021 due to social media and support from figures like Elon Musk. This pushed its market value past $50 billion, placing it among the top cryptocurrencies. Its appeal lies in its vibrant community and widespread adoption for tipping and donations. Whether it remains attractive depends on market trends, community strength, and its real-world uses evolving further. Conclusion ADA and DOGE show steady potential but may see slower short-term growth. In contrast, DOGEN stands out as a luxury-focused token targeting high achievers. With up to 700% growth projected during presale and inspiration from past successes, it appeals to leaders seeking market dominance. Exclusive perks and a thriving community further strengthen its position this altcoin season.

37932164,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631684,1734804678,Overheated stocks and crypto pull back as volatility surge threatens bull market,"Wall Street has been anything but calm this week. Stocks took a beating, crypto markets stumbled, and volatility came back swinging like it owned the place. The S&P 500 plunged 3% midweek after the Federal Reserve dropped a mixed bag of updates, leaving traders scrambling to figure out what comes next. Friday’s 1.1% rally offered a little relief, but it didn’t even scratch the surface of the damage. Bitcoin managed to recover from its slump to $95,000 as is now sitting around $97,000. Austan Goolsbee, the Chicago Federal Reserve President, tried to calm things down during an interview. He mentioned that inflation trends look good, and there’s still room for interest rates to drop. But soothing words don’t pay the bills. Investors are staring at higher bond yields and a market that feels more fragile than ever. Crypto and stocks hit hard as reality sets in The month started with a bang. Markets were hyped on seasonal tailwinds, a softer Fed outlook, and optimism for a booming economy. Everyone was feeling good about speculative plays. Crypto markets were on fire, tech stocks were soaring, and low-quality, high-risk assets were climbing like nobody’s business. But that party didn’t last. Take MicroStrategy, for instance. The company, a favorite among Bitcoin maxis, has tanked by over 30% this month. Other speculative plays followed suit. Strategists had lined up their 2025 predictions like everything was going to be sunshine and rainbows. Turns out, those predictions don’t mean much when Treasury yields are climbing, and the economic-surprise index is heading south. Fed policy confusion rattles nerves Fed chair Jerome Powell’s comments about entering a “new phase” of policy basically translated to, “We’re not sure what’s next, but we’ll let you know.” That uncertainty isn’t exactly what traders wanted to hear. This week’s selloff brought back flashbacks of December 2018 when the Fed’s hawkish tone sent markets spiraling. Back then, it was tariffs and aggressive rate hikes causing the chaos. This time, the issues are different but just as unsettling. The Fed hinted it might be getting closer to a neutral policy rate, but no one can agree on what that even means. Despite all the noise, the U.S. economy is still holding its own. GDP growth is above its long-term trend, and 2025 corporate profit projections are steady. Credit markets are fine, and the broader bull trend hasn’t collapsed. Yet. Negative market breadth is becoming a serious problem. Economically sensitive sectors are struggling, and analysts are saying there’s only a short window for things to improve before the market for stocks starts sending uglier signals. The housing market isn’t looking much better. With yields staying high, it’s stuck in limbo. There’s no momentum, and things won’t change unless rates drop significantly. Some analysts argue that this bull market still has room to run. Historically, post-1945 bull markets last over five years on average. But that stat is misleading. The long runs from 1987 to 2000 and 2009 to 2020 skew the data. Both of those bull markets saw sharp corrections in stocks that nearly ended the party early.

While established tokens like Cronos (CRO) and Toncoin (TON) have gained traction, a new contender, FXGuys , is emerging as a game-changer. With its innovative ecosystem, lucrative staking rewards, and growing adoption, FXGuys’ $FXG token presents an opportunity for CRO and TON holders to turn a modest $100 investment into $10,000. Here’s what makes FXGuys stand out and why it’s being recognized as the best defi token and a leading Top PropFi Project . >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 1. FXGuys: Combining Real Utility With Profit Opportunities FXGuys differentiates itself from traditional crypto projects by offering real-world utility through its Trader Funding Program and Trade2Earn platform. This program allows traders to access up to $500,000 in trading capital after passing a simple evaluation process. For CRO and TON holders, investing in the $FXG token means not only gaining exposure to price appreciation but also tapping into FXGuys’ growing revenue streams. The unique blend of trading infrastructure and DeFi utility positions FXGuys as a top defi coin with exponential growth potential. 2. Staking Rewards: A Passive Income Powerhouse One of the biggest draws for investors is FXGuys’ robust staking mechanism. Holders of the $FXG token can stake their assets to earn double-digit annual percentage yields (APYs) while participating in revenue-sharing from FXGuys’ broker activity. Staking provides a reliable passive income stream, making FXGuys an attractive option for investors who value consistent returns. As staking participation increases, the token supply becomes scarcer, potentially driving up the value of $FXG over time. For Cronos and Toncoin holders looking to diversify their portfolios, FXGuys offers the opportunity to grow their investments steadily while enjoying passive income. 3. The Power of Early Adoption FXGuys is still in its early stages, making it a prime opportunity for investors to enter before mainstream adoption drives the price higher. Early adopters of projects like Solana and Avalanche witnessed staggering returns, and FXGuys could follow a similar trajectory. The best proprietary trading firms are revolutionizing the trading world, and FXGuys is leading the charge with its seamless integration of trading solutions and DeFi rewards. With the token price currently at a fraction of its potential, even a $100 investment could yield exponential returns as the ecosystem grows. 4.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW.

Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm, reported that these bad actors have stolen over $1.3 billion in crypto assets. This sharp rise in crypto crime is part of a bigger, more troubling picture tied to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). The criminal’s growing cybercrime now poses a significant threat to the global blockchain space. Sophisticated Tactics Drive Record-Breaking Crypto Theft Year North Korea nearly doubled its crypto thefts in just one year, earning $1.3 billion, a 02.88% increase. Chainalysis reported 47 separate incidents, with hackers making smaller profits in earlier attacks, usually under $50 million. These operations are now larger and more sophisticated. North Korean hackers have become more skilled at exploiting vulnerabilities . They use tactics like fake identities, controlling remote access, and acting as hiring agents to evade detection and steal larger sums. A Shift in Strategy Amid Global Tensions Interestingly, Chainalysis noticed North Korea’s crypto attacks seemed to dip around June. Around that time, there was a high-profile meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The meeting has sparked speculation that the DPRK might have shifted its cybercriminal strategies to bolster ties with Russia. People fear that the North Korean government might be supporting Russia against the ongoing war in Ukraine. This shift in focus contributed to the temporary reduction in hacking activity. U.S. Cracks Down on North Korean Crypto and Cyber Fraud In December 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) made a significant move, pushing back against North Korean crypto hackers. The legal authorities indicted 14 North Korean individuals involved in a major IT fraud scheme. The indictment exposed a complex operation where the individuals used fake identities to execute wire fraud and money laundering. Reportedly, the illicit funds were channeled back to North Korea . This development highlights the growing international efforts to counter the DPRK’s reliance on cybercrime to finance its weapons program. Experts Urge Stronger Defenses as Crypto Attacks Surge With the rise of these sophisticated attacks , experts like Chainalysis are urging the blockchain industry to tighten its defenses. Blockchain firms are urged to strengthen their partnerships with U.S. law enforcement. By working together, they can better safeguard against future hacks. With cyberattacks rising, the crypto industry must act quickly to prevent falling victim to these growing threats.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance, priced at $0.15, targets real-world asset tokenization, aiming to replicate Solana’s 2021 explosive growth. Table of Contents Solana’s rise and the crypto market dynamics Rexas Finance changing real-world asset tokenization Presale success and token details Conclusion The crypto market has witnessed jaw-dropping returns, but few compare to Solana’s meteoric rise in 2021. Solana’s price soared from $0.15 to $250, turning modest investments into life-changing sums. Now, a new contender, Rexas Finance (RXS) , is poised to replicate that performance, offering a unique opportunity for early investors. Currently priced at $0.15 in its tenth presale stage, RXS promises exponential growth by targeting real-world asset tokenization, a sector ripe for disruption. Crypto whales purchased RXS token Solana’s rise and the crypto market dynamics In early 2021, Solana began its journey with a market cap of $1 billion, supported by only 50 projects and a total value locked (TVL) of $150 million. Its appeal lay in high-speed, low-cost transactions that attracted developers and projects across decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and gaming. By December 2021, Solana’s market cap skyrocketed to $78 billion, with over 300 projects and $15 billion in TVL. This remarkable ascent, driven by strategic infrastructure and ecosystem development, turned early investments into unprecedented returns. Rexas Finance changing real-world asset tokenization Rexas Finance is spearheading the integration of blockchain with real-world assets (RWAs), creating a seamless bridge for investors worldwide. The platform enables tokenization of assets like real estate, commodities, and collectibles, unlocking new possibilities for fractional ownership and global accessibility. Investors can now purchase a fraction of a luxury property in Europe or a share of gold with just a click, removing traditional barriers to entry. The platform’s Rexas Token Builder empowers users to tokenize any real-world asset, simplifying the process and democratizing access. This tool allows individuals and businesses to convert physical assets into digital tokens, making them tradable and accessible to global markets. Rexas Finance’s launchpad offers a venue for innovators to raise funds for tokenized assets, fostering growth in this burgeoning market. Additionally, Rexas Estate changes real estate investment, enabling users to own fractional shares of high-value properties worldwide, creating passive income opportunities. The Rexas Quickmint Bot, Rexas GenAI, and Rexas AI Shield solidify the platform’s technological edge, ensuring secure and efficient tokenization processes. These tools eliminate gaps between real-world assets and blockchain, embedding every conceivable asset class into the blockchain ecosystem. With such comprehensive solutions, Rexas Finance is reshaping the investment landscape. Presale success and token details Rexas Finance’s presale highlights its growing demand among investors. Stages 1 to 9 sold out quickly, raising $26,375,000. Now in its tenth stage, the presale price of RXS has climbed fivefold to $0.15 per token. Early participants are already positioned for significant gains, with a 1.33x return expected at launch. The total amount raised stands at $29,006,305, reflecting strong investor confidence. RXS, an ERC-20 token, has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, allocated as follows: Presale: 42.5% Staking Pool: 22.5% Liquidity: 15% Treasury: 10% Marketing: 3% Team: 3% Giveaway and Partnerships: 4% Notably, Rexas Finance chose a public presale over venture capital funding to democratize access, allowing everyday investors to participate in its growth. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko further enhances its credibility, boosting visibility among millions of users globally. Moreover, Rexas Finance’s CertiK audit underscores its commitment to security, ensuring robust smart contract performance and investor trust. With plans to launch on three Tier-1 exchanges, RXS is primed for broader adoption and liquidity. The $1 million giveaway adds to the excitement, with 20 winners set to receive $50,000 each by completing simple steps and referrals. Conclusion Rexas Finance’s rise mirrors Solana’s journey, offering early investors a chance to capitalize on a unique opportunity.

Cardano (ADA), the project led by Charles Hoskinson, is a top blockchain project. It works on a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and offers strong scalability features. Recently, ADA has not performed as well as it should in the markets, leading Hoskinson to criticize its community engagement and call for reforms. As of today, December 20, ADA is trading 27% down in its weekly charts, keeping around the $0.8 price band for now. Investors have been frustrated by Cardano’s performance weakness despite the platform’s technical strength and feature-rich offering. In comparison, DTX Exchange may be a new platform, but it is designed to be community-driven. It is building a strong network of dedicated investors who are looking forward to trading in crypto along with stocks, forex, and ETFs. DTX Exchange offers its users features like 1000x leverage and governance rights for token holders. As Cardano and DTX move forward, investors must understand their opportunities. Cardano (ADA) Drops 27%, Already Working On Recovery As one of the top 10 altcoins, Cardano’s price movement decreased by over 27% on the weekly chart. Its value moved between $1.116 and $0.819 during this time. The technicals for Cardano (ADA) also hint at further dips. Source: CoinMarketCap The Exponential Moving Average for the intra-day and daily charts shows sell signals, while the monthly and weekly charts give a buy sign. The Relative Strength Index remains neutral throughout all these periods. This, combined with bullish community sentiment and high market volume, can lead to a market recovery soon. While the drop is significant for now, Cardano is backed by a strong team, technical strength, and a high utility platform, allowing it to regain lost market ground over the long term. Investors looking for quick and reliable returns opt for the DTX exchange ICO for its 75% gains. DTX Exchange (DTX): $10 Million Presales Unlocked While Cardano (ADA) is an established altcoin, DTX Exchange (DTX) brings something new to the industry. It targets the potential of a multi-billion-dollar online trading market and is launching a hybrid trading platform offering the best of CEX and DEX platforms. Unlike other trading exchanges, DTX Exchange will let its traders access over 120K asset classes, such as bonds, stocks, crypto coins, etc. It will also offer them significant leverage, as high as 1000x. Traders interested in this project are buying the DTX token. Demand is rising as holders know they will get governance voting rights and a percentage of the trading fee revenue. Millions of tokens have been sold already, helping DTX raise over $10M. Conclusion Cardano (ADA) may see price gains supported by its community, and its innovative pipeline may help it grow despite obstacles, but analysts are optimistic about the DTX Exchange (DTX). Since this presale star in phase six has already given early buyers a significant return, they remain very bullish about it. They predict a potential surge for this altcoin in 2025. Its smaller market cap will give it faster price growth than its peers. Since it will need less money for its price to rise, experts forecast a potential surge for DTX in 2025, making it one of the altcoins to watch.

IOG's Daedalus Upgrade: A Milestone for Cardano’s Future On December 10, 2024, Input Output Global (IOG) debuted Daedalus v7.0.0, an improved full-node desktop wallet specifically for ADA. This upgrade improves ADA delegation, paving the way for the Cardano Constitution referendum and solidifying its position among altcoins to dominate in the 2025 bull run. The update introduces the ability to delegate voting power to Delegated Representatives (DReps), further strengthening Cardano’s governance framework. Additionally, Daedalus v7.0.0 offers automatic voting options, such as “abstain” or “no confidence,” allowing seamless community participation. In the past eight days, ADA experienced a 3% pump as the token price climbed from $0.98 to $1.01. Analysts predict ADA could reach $3 by January 2025. Hedera Takes the Lead: Chainlink Integration Fuels HBAR’s Rise Hedera recently announced that its mainnet now includes Chainlink Data Feeds and Proof of Reserve. This will allow for secure DeFi and tokenized real-world asset applications and equip developers to create tamper-proof and reliable dApps within its ecosystem. With increased network activity and enterprise-grade credibility, HBAR is well-positioned among altcoins to dominate the anticipated 2025 bull run. As HBAR sees more use in transaction fees and staking, demand is expected to rise, solidifying Hedera's position as a dominant force in the RWA ecosystem. In the last two days, HBAR gained 7%, rising from $0.27 to $0.29, and analysts are forecasting a potential price of $0.70 by January 2025. INTL Leads the Top Altcoins to Dominate the Market in 2025 According to experts, INTL, SUI, ADA, and HBAR are the top four altcoins to dominate and shape the future of the crypto market thanks to their unique characteristics, robust communities, and cutting-edge technologies, setting the stage for the 2025 bull run. INTL is now available for purchase in Stage 8 of its public presale, priced at $0.073 per token, with projections indicating a launch price of $0.110. This offers investors a potential 50% ROI. Having already raised over $4.9 million in its presale, analysts anticipate that this AI coin could deliver a 100x gain post-launch, positioning it as one of the altcoins to dominate the market in the future.

In its Quarterly Banking Profile report, the FDIC says the number of US lenders on its “Problem Bank List” rose to 68 in Q3. The figure represents the fifth quarterly increase in the number of banks receiving a rating of 4 or 5 on the CAMELS rating system since Q2 of 2023. A lender with a CAMELS rating of 4 indicates that the firm is experiencing financial, operational or managerial weaknesses – or a combination of such issues – that could reasonably threaten its soundness if unresolved. Meanwhile, a bank with a 5 score on the CAMELS system suggests it is critically falling short in one or more areas and requires abrupt remedial attention. “Total assets held by problem banks rose $3.9 billion to $87.3 billion. Problem banks represent 1.5 percent of total banks, which is within the normal range of 1 to 2 percent of all banks during non-crisis periods” Source: FDIC Meanwhile, the amount of unrealized losses on banks’ balance sheets has dropped. The FDIC says banks are burdened with $364 billion in paper losses as of the third quarter of this year, largely due to exposure to the residential real estate and Treasury markets. Unrealized losses represent the difference between the price banks paid for securities and the current market value of those assets. The banks’ paper losses declined in the third quarter by $148.9 billion from $512.9 billion reported in Q2. However, FDIC Chair Martin J. Gruenberg says the decrease in banks’ paper losses last quarter is only temporary. According to Gruenberg, changes in longer-term interest rates since the end of Q3 indicate that US banks are likely now holding unrealized losses at closer to half a trillion dollars. “Increases in longer-term interest rates since the end of the third quarter would likely reverse most of these improvements in unrealized losses if measured today.” While Gruenberg reiterates the resilience of the banking industry, the FDIC chair notes that a handful of headwinds continue to threaten US lenders. “The industry still faces significant downside risks from the continued effects of inflation, volatility in market interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. These issues could cause credit quality, earnings and liquidity challenges for the industry. In addition, weakness in certain loan portfolios, particularly office properties, credit cards, auto and multifamily housing loans, continues to warrant close monitoring. These issues will remain matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Meanwhile, BONK is defying expectations with explosive gains, and DOGEN has stunned the space by pulling in $4 million during its presale. The stage is set for a thrilling showdown in the world of digital currencies. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. 💎 HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market 💎 This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! ⚡️ Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? ⚡️ DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! 🚀 Ethereum: A Versatile Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Ethereum is a blockchain platform known for its smart contracts and decentralized applications. It uses a Proof-of-Stake system to validate transactions and secure the network. Its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is used for transaction fees, staking rewards, and as a digital asset. Ethereum pioneered ERC-20 tokens, which power various applications. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon improve transaction speed and cost. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 with the Merge. Upcoming features like sharding aim to enhance scalability. ETH remains a key asset in the cryptocurrency market, with price predictions suggesting potential for growth in line with market trends and technological advancements. BONK: A Solana-Based Memecoin Driving Community Engagement BONK is a memecoin built on the Solana blockchain with a Shiba Inu logo. It aims to strengthen the Solana ecosystem by redistributing value to its community instead of large investors. Half of its supply was airdropped to Solana NFT and DeFi users. BONK gained over 10,000% this year and became the 3rd-largest memecoin by market cap. A Coinbase listing boosted its popularity. BONK supports decentralized applications like BonkSwap, its decentralized exchange. Its high supply and memecoin volatility remain challenges. However, its growth and integration within Solana make it an interesting option in the current cryptocurrency market. Buyers may find its focus on community and ecosystem appeal promising. Conclusion ETH and BONK show limited short-term potential, while DOGEN stands out as a symbol of luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth before the presale ends and massive upside during this altcoin season, DOGEN targets ambitious leaders. Following the success of tokens like WIF and Popcat, it aims to dominate with strong perks for early adopters.

Solana Platform and SOL Coin Overview Solana is a blockchain focused on high-speed transactions and decentralized apps. It uses unique architecture to scale without relying on sharding or extra layers. Solana supports development in several programming languages, making it appealing for developers. Its native coin, SOL, powers this ecosystem by processing transactions, running programs, and rewarding contributors. SOL also gives users access to various projects on the network. The platform’s ability to handle heavy activity positions it as a competitor to Ethereum and Cardano. Its efficiency in handling tasks and flexible environment make it a strong contender in the blockchain space. Whether SOL fits the current market depends on its adoption by developers, investors, and projects built within the network. Avalanche (AVAX): Efficient Blockchain with Custom Subnet Capability Avalanche is a scalable blockchain designed for fast and low-cost transactions. It processes up to 4,500 transactions per second with finality achieved in under 2 seconds. The network uses three chains (X-Chain, C-Chain, P-Chain) to optimize tasks like smart contracts and token transfers. Users can create tailored Subnets for specific applications. AVAX, the native token, is used for fees, staking, and maintaining network security. Its eco-friendly setup and diverse functionality make Avalanche appealing. The ability to create customizable networks could attract developers and projects. AVAX may stand out due to its strong utility and technological innovation, offering potential value depending on market trends and demand. Polkadot (DOT): A Protocol for Blockchain Interconnectivity Polkadot is a decentralized network enabling different blockchains to share data and value. It uses parachains to improve transaction processing speed and scalability compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is central to the system, supporting governance and staking, where users can help secure the network and influence its development. Created by Gavin Wood and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot supports a vision of interconnected blockchains working together efficiently. Its ability to link blockchains gives it strong potential in the crypto space. DOT’s attractiveness depends on market conditions and its continued adoption within blockchain projects seeking interoperability. Polygon: Enhancing Ethereum with Low-Cost, Fast Transactions Polygon is a layer two solution for Ethereum, designed for faster and cheaper transactions. It allows users to bridge their assets to access various decentralized apps. POL, its native token, is used for fees, staking, and governance. Polygon uses proof-of-stake, where validators and delegators secure the network and earn rewards. The platform’s low fees and high efficiency support DeFi protocols and applications, scaling Ethereum’s ecosystem. Its adaptability and cost-effectiveness continue to draw attention in the market. Conclusion SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show steady long-term promise but offer limited short-term gains. In contrast, DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for high returns and exclusivity. With a bold community of leaders, unique perks, and an impressive presale growth forecast, DOGEN presents a rare opportunity to dominate this altcoin season and redefine success.

37931464,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631681,1734802949,What’s new for Ciri in The Witcher 4? Developers reveal key details,"The Witcher 4 developers CD Projekt Red have announced changes to Ciri’s abilities. Her teleportation powers and ability to zip around will be drastically toned down or completely removed. Ciri will have new strengths in The Witcher 4. This includes full access to Trial of the Grasses potions and even more advanced magic combat abilities than Geralt’s signs. In an interview with GamesRadar , executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga discussed new adjustments to Ciri’s skills. “If you’re asking me whether we want to raise the bar again, the answer is yes,” said Małgorzata Mitręga. However, she acknowledged she had a challenge in matching the level of Ciri’s invincibility at the end of The Witcher 3, including her abilities in the new game’s trailer. Mitręga hinted that “something totally happened in between,” referring to the changes. The developers wanted The Witcher 4 to have an original story but also related to the lore of the books and the lore of the other games. Mitręga said this was one of the first challenges they solved in development, allowing them to base an interesting story around Ciri’s role as the protagonist. The Witcher 4 trailer shows Ciri using a spell called “Bolt” With her upbringing by Geralt, she will now be faster and far more agile, but her combat style will be dominated by advanced magic. One example that is shown in the trailer unveiled at the Game Awards is the spell “Bolt.” It is much better than Geralt’s signs and seems to go beyond anything Geralt is capable of. Mitręga pointed out that Ciri’s changes make her more different from a witcher-like character. Games director Sebastian Kalemba previously told Eurogamer that Ciri’s depowering is explained logically throughout the story. After keeping the details under wraps, Kalemba said that the team worked hard to give the fans a clear and satisfying explanation of the full story when it launches. These changes may ease fans’ fears about Ciri’s abilities in The Witcher 2. Her teleporting was flashy yet still too easy. Ciri’s spacetime powers have been lost throughout the entire series. Lore enthusiasts have been speculating the reason behind it. Some think she had willingly given them up, or they disappeared after the defeat of the White Frost. Therefore, the adjustments seem to ensure that The Witcher 4 will be a more balanced and fun take on Ciri.

BONK: A Solana-Based Memecoin Driving Community Engagement BONK is a memecoin built on the Solana blockchain with a Shiba Inu logo. It aims to strengthen the Solana ecosystem by redistributing value to its community instead of large investors. Half of its supply was airdropped to Solana NFT and DeFi users. BONK gained over 10,000% this year and became the 3rd-largest memecoin by market cap. A Coinbase listing boosted its popularity. BONK supports decentralized applications like BonkSwap, its decentralized exchange. Its high supply and memecoin volatility remain challenges. However, its growth and integration within Solana make it an interesting option in the current cryptocurrency market. Buyers may find its focus on community and ecosystem appeal promising. Floki Coin: From Meme to Multifunctional Ecosystem Floki was inspired by Elon Musk’s tweet about naming his Shiba Inu ""Floki"" in 2021. It has expanded from being just a meme coin to a token with real use. Floki funds building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria as part of its charity goals. Its ecosystem includes the NFT game Valhalla, the DeFi platform FlokiFi, and a prepaid Floki Card for spending tokens. Partnerships like the one with NOWPayments make Floki usable for real purchases. Analysts see potential in its tools and global reach. It gained attention as a top coin recommendation in 2023. These efforts aim to distinguish Floki from other meme coins by offering utility and stronger applications beyond simple trading. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Dog-Themed Meme Coin on Solana Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. It is inspired by the popular Dogwifhat meme and aims to provide a fun, community-driven experience. Meme coins often gain attention due to their ties to internet trends, with dog-related tokens being especially popular. WIF focuses on creating engagement through its community rather than offering utility like traditional cryptocurrencies. Its current appeal lies in its viral and lighthearted nature, traits that historically attract short-term investor interest. The coin’s potential depends on its ability to maintain online visibility and grow its community during this phase of the market. The technology behind Solana ensures fast and low-cost transactions, which may help the coin sustain user activity. PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Internet Culture PEPE is a memecoin based on the Pepe the Frog meme and runs on the Ethereum network. It mimics popular coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu but embraces its lack of practical use. PEPE has no transaction taxes and aims to grow through online trends and listings on major exchanges. Its burning mechanism reduces supply, and it rewards long-term holders. In 2023, it reached a $1.6 billion market cap, driven by strong community support. Built as an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum’s infrastructure. PEPE’s simplicity, deflationary design, and internet culture appeal have made it stand out. It remains an interesting option in the current market for those drawn to memecoins. Conclusion BONK, FLOKI, WIF, and PEPE show limited short-term potential but could have steady growth ahead. However, DOGEN stands out with its focus on luxury, leadership, and exclusivity. With a projected 700% gain by the presale's end and even greater returns during this altcoin season, it appeals to high achievers aiming for dominance and unparalleled rewards.

These contrasting developments have left investors questioning what’s next for both assets in an already unpredictable market. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon?

Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign.

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Chainlink and the Potential of LINK Token in Blockchain Networks Chainlink is a system that connects blockchains to real-world data and applications. It enables smart contracts to use external data securely and accurately. This is done through oracles, which fetch and verify external information for blockchains. Chainlink works with both on-chain and off-chain components to handle data efficiently. The LINK token plays a key role in the network. It rewards those who run nodes, supports staking for security, and is used as payment for services. The technology has strong potential, especially as the need for reliable data in blockchain grows. LINK's appeal depends on market conditions and demand for decentralized applications needing real-world data. Conclusion LINK and other coins show slower short-term potential, while DOGEN stands out with its luxury-driven appeal and high growth expectations. Designed for achievers, DOGEN targets a 700% rise by the presale's end and boasts massive long-term possibilities. Inspired by past successes, DOGEN is set to foster a strong community focused on excellence and unique advantages for early supporters.

Combined with its strong launch performance and ambitious roadmap, CYBRO is shaping up to be a leader in decentralized finance. Join CYBRO Now Before the Next Big Jump Solana's SOL: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications, competing with Ethereum and Cardano. Solana stands out with its design that aims for faster transactions. Developers can build on it using multiple programming languages. SOL is Solana's native cryptocurrency. It is central to the ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The SOL coin holds value because it underpins the operation of Solana's network. It rewards participants and allows users access to a suite of projects on Solana. Unlike some platforms, Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions. It aims to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network. Avalanche (AVAX): Layer-1 Blockchain with Customizable Subnets Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain known for its eco-friendly approach, low fees, and efficient transactions. It can process up to 4,500 transactions per second and allows users to launch customizable subnets. Avalanche uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in less than 2 seconds. The platform consists of 3 interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which facilitate various operations like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, serving important roles in the ecosystem such as transaction fees, network security through staking, and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Exploring Polkadot: Connecting Blockchains for Seamless Interoperability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol that lets different blockchains communicate securely. It enables value and data to be shared between networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without the need for intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The DOT token is at the heart of this network, used for governance and staking. This allows holders to participate in the development of the protocol and help verify transactions. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and supported by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to make blockchains more interconnected and efficient. Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL): Powering the Polygon Network The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is a utility token central to the Polygon network. It enables various functions within the ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens to help secure the network and earn additional POL in return. This involves locking up tokens and participating in the network's consensus. POL also grants voting rights, allowing holders to influence decisions about the network's development. Additionally, the token provides access to exclusive services and features within the Polygon ecosystem. As the network expands with more services and applications, POL plays a key role due to its wide range of uses. Conclusion While coins like SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show potential, their short-term growth may be limited. In contrast, CYBRO offers investors exceptional opportunities to boost their earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With benefits such as high staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO delivers a superior user experience with easy deposits and withdrawals. Focusing on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO emerges as a promising project attracting strong interest from crypto whales and influencers.

37930608,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313610,1734801640,"This Crypto Sector Could Rally by up to 5x in 2025 and Outperform Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, Says Analyst","Real Vision’s crypto analyst Jamie Coutts is outlining the major trends that the cryptocurrency industry is likely to witness in 2025. Coutts says on the social media platform X that the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector could go up by between 4x and 5x as a result of the traditional finance (TradFi) sector entering the space. Amid the massive growth, Coutts predicts that some DeFi protocols could outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). He also sees the start of an entanglement between DeFi and TradFi next year. “Big Trends For 2025 1. TradFi starts catching up – expect CEX (centralized exchange) acquisitions and more crypto integrations (Robinhood/Arbitrum) 2. Several CEXs file and list on TradFi exchanges. 3. Several CEXs build out their own DEX platforms (L2s) or multichain integrations 4. RWA (real-world asset) pumps the sector valuations as financial asset tokenization ramps up (esp stocks and fixed income) 5. TradFi growth investors start adding crypto sleeves – DeFi sector a priority because they can be modeled on cashflows 6. DeFi sector goes up by a 4-5x. Several protocols outperform ETH/SOL/BTC.” Coutts adds the numbers show that crypto is quickly gaining ground against the more established TradFi industry. “This is wild. Crypto is eating TradFi’s lunch. 1. Coinbase: 11% of global exchange revenue, ranked 5th, ahead of Nasdaq. 2. DEXs (decentralized exchanges): 5%, outranking HKEX (The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong) and CBOE. 3. Total CEX revenue could hit parity with TradFi in 2024. 4. CEX and DEXs are growing 2.5-4x faster than TradFi. 5. DEXs are some of the most ‘profitable’ applications in the world. 6. If you value the CEX sector on Coinbase’s P/S (price to sales) multiple: total market cap would be $749 billion vs TradFi’s $610 billion.” At time of writing, the total DeFi market cap stands at $152.616 billion.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Toncoin & Solana near resistance levels, but Lightchain AI steals the spotlight at $0.003. Table of Contents Toncoin aiming for new heights Solana recovering for a bullish breakout Lightchain AI, the whale magnet Comparing the Potential TON, SOL, and LCAI A new leader in the making? The crypto market is buzzing as Toncoin (TON) and Solana (SOL) approach critical resistance levels, raising hopes of new all-time highs. However, the focus is shifting to a rising star Lightchain AI (LCAI). With whales accumulating this presale token priced at just $0.003, many are wondering if LCAI could overshadow the gains of TON and SOL. Let’s explore what’s driving the hype and the potential for these tokens to break records in the near future. You might also like: How Lightchain AI’s roadmap is winning over Solana enthusiasts Toncoin aiming for new heights Toncoin (TON) the home token of Telegram Open Network has been getting a lot of speed due to its easy joining with the Telegram message app. As Telegr͏am keeps growing its blockchain world TON is getting more and more useful. A big reason for this rise is the growth of its system. With TON’s joining in Telegram wallets, more than 700 million folks can simply send and get cryptocurrency, really helping adoption. Also, the TON chain is spreading its use by starting DeFi tools and NFT shops, widening its charm. Body interest is also doing a big part, with more looks from backers helping to steady TON’s cost moves and adding to its far-off chances. While Toncoin’s path to a new peak has some bumps, its special spot in the Telegram world makes it a strong player to see. Solana recovering for a bullish breakout Solana (SOL) , known for its high-speed transactions and minimal fees, has experienced a volatile year but is now showing signs of recovery. As its ecosystem continues to expand, investors are increasingly optimistic about SOL reclaiming its former glory. Solana is gaining traction in NFTs, gaming, and DeFi, with several high-profile projects launching on its blockchain, fueling its growing ecosystem. Recent network upgrades have also addressed concerns about downtime, improving stability and boosting investor confidence. Additionally, Solana’s partnerships with web3 gaming and decentralized payment platforms position it as a leader in creativity. With its focus on speed and scalability, Solana is poised as a strong contender for a breakout rally, particularly as the broader market trends upward. Lightchain AI, the whale magnet While Toncoin and Solana gear up for potential breakouts, Lightchain AI is swooping in like the hero of a blockbuster presale. At just $0.003, LCAI is turning heads with its game-changing marriage of blockchain and AI. Why Are Whales Falling for LCAI? Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) – Forget basic dApps — LCAI’s AIVM lets developers unleash AI-powered dApps that could disrupt industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Think Skynet… but friendly. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) – Mining? So last decade. LCAI rewards nodes for meaningful AI computations, creating a network that actually does something useful. Who said blockchains can’t multitask? Scalable and Sustainable Design – With privacy-preserving tech and federated learning, LCAI is built for businesses looking to play it big. Enterprise-ready? Check. Intriguing to institutional investors? Double check. Deflationary Tokenomics – A piece of every transaction gets burned, making LCAI more scarce—and potentially more valuable — over time. Scarcity meets savvy. LCAI price prediction Analysts are calling it 15,000% gains by 2025. That’s right, LCAI may just go from underdog to market MVP faster than the next big thing. Don’t blink, or you’ll miss the rocket. Comparing the Potential TON, SOL, and LCAI Toncoin is emerging as a strong contender for a new all-time high, thanks to its integration with Telegram and its growing utility. Solana is also positioned for a bullish breakout as its ecosystem continues to expand and its network stability improves. However, the standout option for exponential growth is Lightchain AI . With its unique blend of AI integration, scalability, and an attractive low entry price, LCAI presents a compelling opportunity. While TON and SOL boast established use cases and robust ecosystems, LCAI’s innovative approach to combining AI and blockchain technology sets it apart as a potential game-changer in the market. A new leader in the making? As Toncoin and Solana work to reclaim their all-time highs, Lightchain AI is emerging as a leading force in the crypto market. Its presale price of $0.003 and unique features make it a whale magnet, positioning it as a potential leader in the next crypto bull run. For investors looking to diversify, TON and SOL remain strong contenders, but LCAI offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for exponential growth. Visit Lightchain AI to join the presale and secure a stake in the future of blockchain innovation. The next big thing is possibly here, and it’s called Lightchain AI . So, keep an eye on the market as these tokens continue to make waves and potentially reach new heights in the near future. Who knows, one of them may even become the next Bitcoin?

Wearing its early growth on its sleeve, the platform has disrupted and will continue to disrupt the market as it showcases its strong strategic partnerships and uniquely valuable approach.

37930263,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99250,1734800886,Ripple’s XRP Bullish Pattern Hints at Gigantic Breakout — Is a Major Eruption to $5 XRP Price Ahead?,"XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market have moved sideways over the past few days. Despite the widespread sentiment, XRP holds key support levels, which could see it resume an uptrend. XRP was trading at $2.24 at the time of writing after a 0.6% dip in the last 24 hours. Analyst Brett on X notes that XRP’s price movements have seen the coin break out of a symmetrical triangle pattern. If the bulls continue to dominate the price movement, XRP will likely continue to soar, with the next key levels to watch being between $3.62 and $4.3 per analyst. A rally beyond this breakout point could see XRP aiming for $5.73. XRP Price Hints at a Possible Bullish Divergence XRP’s technical indicators are currently showing a bullish divergence. Amid the recent drop in price, some traders took advantage of the low prices to accumulate more. The Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) line has sharply moved north and crossed above the signal line. This hints at possible gains ahead if bulls continue to overpower bears. However, the RSI is at 46, showing that sellers still have the upper hand and are inhibiting the price action. For the uptrend to resume, buying pressure needs to build up. The Awesome Oscillator also proves the bullish divergence. The AO histogram bars have flipped positive but remain in negative territory. The indicator shows that while XRP shows signs of a reversal, more buyers are needed to confirm the uptrend. Traders should also watch out for the crucial support level at $2.2 A slip below it could stir panic and cause XRP to drop lower.

37930182,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375382,1734800792,Nigeria Arrests 792 in Landmark Crypto-Romance Scam Raid,"Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on December 10 arrested 792 people linked to a massive crypto-romance scam operating out of Lagos. The suspects, who included 148 Chinese, 40 Filipinos, and several other foreign nationals, were caught during a surprise raid at an imposing seven-story structure known as Big Leaf in the affluent Victoria Island neighborhood. Sophisticated Scam Network Unveiled According to information shared by the agency, the operation followed intelligence reports, which indicated that Big Leaf was a hub for fraudulent activities targeting victims around the globe. Investigations revealed a highly organized network where foreign operatives collaborated with local accomplices to swindle unwitting individuals through romance and investment hoaxes. The Nigerian recruits, chosen for their proficiency with computers, were reportedly trained for at least two weeks on how to impersonate foreign women and engage victims in romantic and business conversations. They then created fake profiles on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram, which they used to lure targets to invest in bogus crypto schemes hosted on a platform called Yooto[.]com. The website required users to pay an activation fee starting from $35, with promises of high returns. Per investigators, after the Nigerians initiated contact with potential victims and built their confidence, they handed over communication to the foreign operatives who then executed the scams. This division of labor ensured that the local accomplices were kept in the dark about the full extent of the criminal enterprise. During their inquiries, authorities found at least 500 SIM cards and high-end computers on the premises, which were presumably used to maintain anonymity and target individuals primarily from North America and Europe. Further, they stated that the Nigerian recruits received cash payments for their part in the con, with no documentation, helping to obscure the identity of the operation’s masterminds, who remain at large. The agency is working with international partners to uncover the full extent of the scheme and any connections it may have to organized crime networks. Large-Scale Crypto Fraud Schemes Crypto scams have been on the rise recently, with a study by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) revealing that Australians had lost nearly $270 million to fake investments. Elsewhere, South Korean law enforcement apprehended 215 people accused of perpetrating a $232 million crypto rip-off. Among those arrested was a popular YouTuber with more than 600,000 followers who allegedly ran a phony investment consulting firm pushing a purported digital asset product promising 20-fold returns. Also, in October, Hong Kong police dismantled a huge cross-border fraud operation that used deepfakes to lure men into deceptive crypto investments. Like in the Nigerian case, the Hong Kong group, consisting of at least 27 individuals, operated from a building in the city’s Hung Hom area. Upon raiding the facility, authorities recovered computers, mobile phones, and about $25,000 in suspected criminal proceeds.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-solana-memecoin-to-explode-18000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

However, the cryptocurrency has now reached a significant support zone, where a rebound followed by consolidation is anticipated. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum’s $4K price region has proven to be a critical resistance zone over the past year, consistently halting bullish advances due to strong selling pressure. Most recently, the price faced another rejection at this level, triggering a significant sell-off. This decline was further fueled by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s remarks, suggesting the central bank might pause its current policy of lowering key interest rates. Despite this setback, ETH has found support at the $3K level, a crucial price zone, leading to a rebound above the $3.5K threshold. Currently, the cryptocurrency is consolidating within the $3.5K–$4K range, with expectations of a potential bullish attempt to retest the $4K resistance following this consolidation phase. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum’s rejection at the $4K resistance triggered a sharp decline, breaking below the ascending wedge pattern—a clear indication of sellers’ dominance. This bearish momentum pushed the price lower, leading to a pullback before resuming its downtrend. At present, Ethereum is trading within a significant support zone, defined by the 0.5 ($3.2K)–0.618 ($3K) Fibonacci retracement levels. This is expected to provide stability in the short to mid-term, with the likelihood of continued consolidation and minor retracements. If this support holds, buyers may re-enter the market, setting the stage for another attempt to challenge the $4K resistance. Source: TradingView Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum’s failure to reclaim the $4K threshold triggered significant liquidations in the futures market, followed by a flash crash that appears to have substantially cooled the broader sentiment. The chart illustrates the funding rates metric, a reliable indicator of futures market sentiment. While Ethereum’s aggregate funding rates saw a sharp spike last week, the rejection at $4K led to substantial liquidations, bringing funding rates back to levels conducive to a bullish trend. This cooling effect could pave the way for a more sustainable rally in the coming weeks. A similar pattern was observed in January 2024 when a sharp decline in funding rates calmed the futures market, setting the stage for Ethereum’s next major impulsive rally. This historical precedent suggests that the current market reset could mark the beginning of another bullish phase.

Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the price has been gradually rising over the last few weeks, creating a new record high above the $100K mark. However, in the past few days, the market has failed to continue its bullish momentum, falling below $100K and even dropping to as low as $92,000. If the market fails to reclaim this area soon, a deeper correction toward the $90K level and even the $80K support zone could be expected in the short term. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, the price action looks a bit more tricky to anticipate. The market has been making higher highs and lows inside an ascending channel but has been rejected from the higher boundary of the channel around the $108K mark. The $100K level has consequently been broken to the downside, and the RSI is also showing values below 50%, which indicates that market momentum has shifted to bearish. Yet, the lower trendline still holds, which could lead to a quick recovery above the $100K level and a bullish continuation. However, if the pattern is broken to the downside, a drop below the $90K level could be expected. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Active Addresses (100-Day MA) Analyzing on-chain metrics can yield valuable and interesting information about the underlying market dynamics. One of these key metrics that can offer insight beyond the price action is the active addresses metric. Bitcoin’s network activity is one of the fundamental factors that can help in BTC valuation. The chart shows that the 100-day moving average of active addresses has been recovering rapidly during the recent uptrend and breakout above the $70K zone. However, it is yet to reach its all-time high, which depicts a clear divergence between price action and network activity. As a result, if network activity does not make a new record high soon and starts to fall again, a lengthy correction could occur for Bitcoin.

37929635,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99248,1734799655,Bitcoin Addresses Drop by 211K Amid Market Uncertainty: Could a Rally Be Next?,"Wallets holding Bitcoin are now declining in number, while those that hold the meme-based Dogecoin appear to be increasing in number. Bitcoin’s ecosystem is experiencing waves of doubt. According to fresh data from analytics company Santiment, there has been a decline of more than 211,000 non-empty Bitcoin addresses in three weeks alone, which has sparked the interest of observers in the market. Such a steep drop in active addresses has been observed to be succeeded by price recoveries, and market observers are keenly watching. Market Uncertainty Dampens Bitcoin Activity Bitcoin is quite accustomed to fluctuations and exacerbations that occur during significant events. Nevertheless, weeks after the US elections have caused turbulence in both traditional and crypto markets in the past. Given the controversies concerning policy focus, funding, and additional changes, some Bitcoin traders seem to be reinforcing their bets. Santiment data reports that Bitcoin active addresses have dropped to 54.38 million, which is associated with increased fear among owners. This change highlights the “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD) that often coincides with election cycles, causing shifts in investor behavior. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1853513818833666063 Bitcoin’s price movement has echoed these market jitters, dropping under $95,000 before bouncing back above $97,500. With volatility evident in the market, some traders are bracing for more fluctuations while keeping a close watch on Bitcoin’s next move. IntoTheBlock’s data also highlight a shift in the strategy of long-term Bitcoin holders. Unlike previous cycles, where volatile markets often see seasoned investors exit en masse, this cycle appears to show a tempered response. Long-term holders adjust their positions at a moderate pace, suggesting a desire to reduce exposure while keeping skin in the game. This shift reflects an evolving investor sentiment, where caution is balanced by confidence in Bitcoin’s longer-term potential. Bitcoin Holders Balance, Source: IntoTheBlock Bitcoin’s history shows that declines in non-empty addresses, especially during uncertain periods, can often foreshadow a bounce once tensions ease. Santiment notes that previous downturns in active addresses were followed by recovery phases, fueled by renewed buying interest once selling pressure subsided. If the broader market clears its current uncertainty this week, we could see a similar bullish rebound for Bitcoin—one that might propel its price past key resistance levels. Other Crypto Assets Display Mixed Signals Santiment’s analysis also points to contrasting trends in other crypto assets. USDC, the popular stablecoin, witnessed an 11,600-wallet drop in a single day, indicating a similar pullback in stablecoin interest. Meanwhile, Dogecoin bucked the trend with a surge of 46,400 new wallets in just one week, reflecting fresh speculative interest in meme coins. These shifts hint at a market in flux, with investors selectively choosing where to park funds during this politically charged period. In the coming days, Bitcoin’s performance may serve as an indicator of broader market sentiment. If history repeats itself, this drop in wallet activity could be the precursor to a renewed price push, transforming today’s FUD into tomorrow’s gains.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-addresses-drop-by-211k-amid-market-uncertainty-could-a-rally-be-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Data from DOGE’s spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $519.19 million worth of DOGE in the past 7 days.

37929185,https://crypto.news/?p=14321298,1734798669,"Shiba Inu, Bonk, Pepe prices rebound: Beware of dead cat bounce","Most meme coin prices rebounded on Saturday, Dec. 21, after falling for most of the week, with their combined market cap rising by 4.7% to $109 billion. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) price rose by 12.6% to an intraday high of $0.00002397. Bonk ( BONK ), the biggest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem, rose by 20% to $0.000032. Pepe ( PEPE ) and other popular meme coins like Dogwifhat and Pudgy Penguins rose by over 15%. This rebound happened after a Bitcoin ( BTC ) plunge from $108,200 to $97,000 triggered a big crash in most altcoins. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies dropped from over $3.7 trillion to $3.37 trillion. The rebound is likely due to the US’s encouraging Personal Consumption Expenditure report. The headline PCE, the Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation gauge, softened from 0.2% in October to 0.1% in November. Core PCE dropped from 0.3% to 0.1%, a sign that inflation in urban and rural areas was slowing. American stocks also reacted positively to the PCE report on Friday, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 indices rising by over 1.18%, 1.10%, and 0.85%, respectively. These numbers came a few days after a hawkish Fed decision triggered a sell-off in risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. The bank slashed rates by 0.25%, bringing the yearly cuts to one percent, and hinted that it would deliver two more cuts in 2024. The last meeting’s dot plot pointed to four cuts. The Fed justified its hawkish view to the stubbornly high inflation. Recent data showed that the headline Consumer Price Index rose to 2.7%, while the core CPI remained at 3.3%. The bank also suspects that some of President-elect Donald Trump’s policies (i.e., tariffs) will be inflationary. You might also like: Meme coins crash: why are Brett, PNUT, Popcat falling? Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Pepe rise could be a dead cat bounce Meme coins like Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk also likely jumped as crypto investors bought the dip after they dropped for three consecutive days. A potential risk for the ongoing rebound is that this could be a dead cat bounce. A DCB is a situation where falling asset prices stage a brief rebound and then resume the downward trend. For example, Shiba Inu dropped by 15% on Dec. 9 and by 1% on the following day. It then formed a DCB by rising by 6% on Dec. 11 and then resumed its downtrend, reaching a low of $0.00001855 on Dec. 20. Shiba Inu price has formed dead cat bounces in the past | Source: crypto.news The other potential risk for these coins, especially Shiba Inu, is that some of them have formed a head and shoulders chart pattern. An H&S pattern is a popular bearish reversal sign made up of a head, two shoulders, and a neckline, which is at $0.00002280. That is a sign that the coin may continue the downtrend.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) face challenges in the volatile crypto space, one token is bucking the trend. This token is DTX Exchange (DTX) , a phase six presale sensation that has given early buyers a 500% return. While analysts like Del Crxpto and Sssebi have made bold price predictions for SHIB and ADA, DTX has some advantages over them. Many experts even predict a potential 5x growth for this crypto coin in 2025. You might also like: Last chance to get DTX Exchange before it soars, set to follow ETH, XRP DTX Exchange price soars 500%, exciting traders While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) are in a bearish trend right now, DTX Exchange is only seeing price growth. Those who bought this altcoin early on now see a 500% return. Moreover, since this presale is now in phase six and more stages are left, this percentage will not stop growing soon. DTX Exchange offers something new: participation in the $133T bonds market and many more markets through a hybrid CEX/DEX platform. It will allow traders to use the maximum capability by providing them with 1000x leverage and access to over 120,000 assets (bonds, CFDs, crypto coins, and more). Those who hold the DTX token will get up to 15% APY in staking rewards, governance voting rights, and more. With over $10M raised and 300K users onboarded, the future appears bright for this altcoin. It costs just $0.12, but phase seven of its presale will jump to $0.14. Not only that, a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap listing DTX is expected to trigger a rally to $0.20. This could result in a 66% return for all who buy DTX now. Del Crxpto: The price of Shiba Inu may reach $0.01 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a powerful force in the meme coin space. However, its price performance has not been so good recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the Shiba Inu price fell nearly 20% in the past 30 days. During that time, its value moved between $0.000024 and around $0.000020. However, crypto analyst Del Crxpto remains optimistic for Shiba Inu. In a recent X post, he told his followers that the $0.01 dream for this meme coin could come true. This Shiba Inu price prediction has excited many traders in the market. Nevertheless, the Shiba Inu market cap of over $10B may slow its growth. This high market cap means that the Shiba Inu coin will need a lot of new money for its price to skyrocket. On the other hand, crypto coins like DTX will not face this issue. Cardano price goes in the red, analyst remains bullish Cardano (ADA) is another altcoin showing some red price charts. On the one-week chart, the price of Cardano has sunk from around $1 to below $0.80. In other words, nearly a 25% drop as per CoinMarketCap. Market expert Sssebi, however, is still bullish on this altcoin. According to his X post, he will not be selling Cardano. He also announced he is waiting for the 10x surge that will come after this dip in his Cardano price prediction. Although the Cardano crypto may see a price gain soon, other experts think it may not be so big. This crypto coin has seen a YTD price increase of nearly 40%, which may have been its highest upswing. Therefore, some investors are turning to DTX Exchange instead. What may the future bring for DTX Exchange, Shiba Inu & Cardano? While Shiba Inu and Cardano face challenges, they could rebound soon as they have strong community backing. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is demonstrating what real-world utility and creativity can bring. With a surge of over 500% so far, experts are very bullish about it. Its ties to the growing $133T bonds market could also give it long-term stability. Therefore, they forecast a potential 5x surge for this crypto coin in 2025. For more information, visit the DTX Excha n ge presale website and join the online community.

His strategy revolves around creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) to boost economic growth, strengthen the US dollar, and open new opportunities in the digital asset market. This proposal coincides with MicroStrategy expanding its Board of Directors, adding three influential figures in crypto and finance. The company, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, currently holds 439,000 Bitcoin worth over $43 billion. Saylor explained his vision on December 20, outlining how an SBR could solve economic challenges and help neutralize national debt. He claims this policy could create a digital asset market worth $10 trillion, driving demand for US Treasuries and encouraging innovation. According to Saylor, this shift could elevate the valuation of the digital economy from $1 trillion to $590 trillion, generating between $16 trillion and $81 trillion in wealth for the US Treasury. He believes this approach would empower businesses, create jobs, and ensure America leads the global digital revolution. “A strong digital asset strategy can boost the US dollar, reduce debt, and unleash massive economic growth,” Saylor stated. However, critics are skeptical of his ambitious claims. Prominent venture capitalist Nic Carter argues that Bitcoin’s volatility and the lack of a clear framework for the SBR could destabilize financial markets. Bitcoin’s recent price drop from $108,000 to $92,000, Carter says, highlights its unreliability as a reserve asset. He also warns that such a move could weaken the dollar’s global dominance instead of enhancing it. “I don’t support this idea, and neither should anyone else,” Carter said. To strengthen its crypto focus, MicroStrategy has appointed three new board members with significant expertise in the field. Brian Brooks, former CEO of Binance US and an experienced crypto regulator, joins the board alongside Jane Dietze, Chief Investment Officer at Brown University, and Gregg Winiarski, Chief Legal Officer at Fanatics Holdings. These members bring a diverse mix of skills in finance, technology, and emerging markets, aligning with MicroStrategy’s broader vision for digital assets. Brooks, known for his leadership roles at Coinbase and BitFury Group, brings invaluable regulatory experience. Dietze has also served on the board of Galaxy Digital, a leading crypto asset management firm. Winiarski offers insights from the digital sports industry, adding another layer of expertise to the board’s strategic direction. While Saylor’s plan aims to position the US as a leader in the digital economy, it remains controversial. Supporters see potential for massive growth and innovation, but critics warn of significant risks due to Bitcoin’s price instability and uncertain regulatory environment. The debate underscores the complex challenges of integrating digital assets into traditional economic systems.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/michael-saylor-pushes-bitcoin-plan-to-boost-us-economy,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37929191.jpeg
37929151,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666118,1734798632,Toncoin Price Heat Map Reveals $20 Target – Analyst,"Prominent altcoin Toncoin (TON) was not left out of the widespread crypto decline in the last week. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of Toncoin dipped by 14.71% over the past seven days falling from a consolidation range between $6.2-$6.5. However, this market downturn does not deter market experts’ bullishness on TON especially with the altseason yet to go into full effect. Related Reading: Toncoin’s 90-Day Returns Turn Positive: Is A Massive Rally On The Horizon? Toncoin To Gain At Least 280% In Altseason, Analyst Says In a recent X post, popular crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci revealed multiple price targets for Toncoin in the current altcoin bull run/altseason, a period where altcoins generally outperform Bitcoin in price appreciation indicated by a decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance. Firstly, the analyst notes that Toncoin’s 365-day moving average currently at $5.14 has historically represented a region where price activity significantly slows down. Notably, Toncoin has only experienced a prolonged price dip below this level in a bear market. However, with the crypto market in a bull cycle, Kesmeci postulates that a one-year SMA could represent the potential local bottom for TON. Therefore, using this price point with multiple levels of standard deviation (σ), the analyst predicts possible price targets of Toncoin that are statistically compared to historical data. From the chart below, Toncoin is expected to hit an initial price of $8.74 as the altseason takes off based on the price level revealed by the one-year SMA + 2σ. This indicates a potential 60.6% gain on the altcoin’s current market price. Thereafter, a higher price band of one-year SMA + 6σ indicates a price target of $15.93. The final price goal for Toncoin by Burak Kesmeci is based on the one-year SMA + 8σ and set at $19.53. Going by this prediction, the crypto analyst states that Toncoin could have gained by 280% in the first phase of the altseason. However, investors should note that price targets are likely to change with moving prices as the projection is based on the simple moving average. Related Reading: Altcoins Set For $627 Billion Inflow As Altseason Prepares For Takeoff What Now For Toncoin? Following the crypto market decline this week, Toncoin found a local price bottom at $4.71 and is currently undergoing a modest price recovery as it hovers around the $5.40 price zone. In attaining any of Kesmeci’s price predictions, the altcoin will need to break past a minor resistance at the $6.5 price region and also overcome a major price opposition at $7.0. In other developments, Toncoin’s daily trading volume has grown by 3.61% attaining a value of $619.19 million. With a market cap of $13.91 billion, the digital asset remains the ninth-largest cryptocurrency in the market.

37930696,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52812,1734798364,"Analyst Predicts 11,000% XRP Price Rally","XRP has caught the attention of market analysts after breaking out of a 5.5-year consolidation phase. Despite recent setbacks, optimism remains strong regarding the asset’s long-term prospects. The cryptocurrency witnessed a significant price increase of 283% in November 2024, marking a decisive breakout from its prolonged consolidation phase. However, this upward momentum faced challenges in December, as XRP retreated from a recent high of $2.9 on December 3. The asset subsequently entered a period of range-bound trading between $2 and $2.6, before dipping to $2.15 following a broader market decline triggered by the Federal Reserve’s 0.25% interest rate cut. A Bold XRP to $251 Prediction Market analysts have highlighted the significance of XRP’s breakout and its potential for a substantial rally. Amonyx, a well-known market commentator, compared this recent move to XRP’s behavior in March 2017. At that time, the asset also broke out of a multi-year consolidation phase, climbing 284% before embarking on a historic rally of nearly 60,000% from $0.0055 to an all-time high of $3.31 in January 2018. Amonyx predicts that history could repeat itself, with XRP potentially surging to a long-term target of $251. This figure corresponds with the 161.8% Fibonacci retracement level and represents a staggering 50,100% increase from XRP’s starting price of November 2024. Despite the ambitious nature of this prediction, it has sparked considerable interest within the crypto community. If you’re not mentally ready for this, you can’t blame anyone. #XRP pic.twitter.com/HaTlvRE62o — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 18, 2024 Whale Activity and Market Demand Amid XRP’s recent price struggles, demand appears to be growing among large investors. Market commentator Ali Martinez recently reported that whales purchased approximately 30 million XRP in just 24 hours, indicating a strong vote of confidence during the asset’s dip. This accumulation suggests that significant market players remain optimistic about XRP’s potential to recover and resume its upward trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Perspectives on XRP Several prominent analysts share Amonyx’s optimistic outlook. CryptoBull, for instance, has identified XRP’s current corrective phase as a temporary setback, expecting it to conclude within the week. According to the analyst, XRP could climb to $6 once this phase ends. Veteran analyst Michael van de Poppe has also expressed confidence in XRP’s role as a market leader. As the cryptocurrency surged toward $2 earlier this month, van de Poppe described XRP as a “leading indicator” for altcoin market strength. He believes XRP’s performance could set the stage for a broader rally across the altcoin market, potentially sparking the next altcoin season. Additionally, technical analyst EGRAG highlighted the importance of XRP closing above $2.3 on the 3-day chart. While the asset fell short, closing at $2.23, it has since risen to $2.3 recording a 1% daily gain. EGRAG identified $2.62 as a critical level to watch, noting that surpassing this threshold could solidify a bullish formation. As XRP navigates its current correction, analysts agree that its future trajectory will depend on several factors, including market sentiment and broader economic conditions. The asset’s ability to recover from recent setbacks and maintain its momentum will be crucial in determining whether predictions of a $251 price level can materialize.

37929134,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99245,1734798325,Experts Forecast Timeline for U.S. To Eliminate $36 Trillion Debt Using Bitcoin,"As the debate about how to manage the U.S. national debt gains momentum, key players in the crypto sector are increasingly discussing the potential role of Bitcoin in offsetting the nation’s $36 trillion debt. On Saturday, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, weighed in on the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), calling it a “feasible approach.” Ju noted that in 2024 alone, $352 billion in new inflows drove a $1 trillion market cap increase, underscoring Bitcoin’s potential for capital generation. He argued that if the U.S. government designated Bitcoin as a strategic asset as a first step, acquiring 1 million BTC by 2050 could offset 36% of the national debt, especially considering most of it is held domestically. “With 70% of U.S. debt held domestically, offsetting 36% of it by acquiring 1 million Bitcoin by 2050 becomes feasible if the U.S. government designates Bitcoin as a strategic asset,” he said , echoing sentiments by Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck. Moreover, on Friday, prominent Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor further advanced the discussion by publishing a Bitcoin and crypto framework to position the United States as a leader in the global digital economy. Among his proposals was the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which he argued could generate $16 to $81 trillion in wealth for the U.S. Treasury, potentially offsetting the national debt completely. The idea has also gained traction among pro-crypto lawmakers, with Senator Cynthia Lummis emerging as a leading advocate. In July, Lummis introduced the Bitcoin Act in Congress to formalize the proposal. On Thursday, Lummis highlighted the importance of using Bitcoin to stabilize the U.S. financial system, asserting that, despite Bitcoin’s volatility, its potential for long-term growth could provide a solution to the country’s mounting debt issues. “Bitcoin’s long-term growth far exceeds the U.S. dollar,” she explained during an interview with Yahoo Finance. She further suggested that the U.S. acquire 200,000 Bitcoin annually over five years, totaling 1 million BTC, and hold it for at least 20 years. According to her, such an investment could generate a $16 trillion fund, substantially boosting the U.S. economy. “This approach offers multiple benefits,” Lummis explained. “By shoring up the U.S. dollar with a hard asset like Bitcoin, we could help stabilize the currency and offset some of our $36 trillion national debt.” Let’s recall that during his 2024 presidential campaign, President Trump endorsed the concept of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve as a bold and unconventional strategy to address the national debt crisis. “ How about we pay off our $35 trillion? Give them a little check in crypto, give them some Bitcoin, and pay off the debt,” he had stated during an interview, lending significant weight to the proposal.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/experts-forecast-timeline-for-u-s-to-eliminate-36-trillion-debt-using-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
37928925,https://finbold.com/?p=221591,1734798194,R.Kiyosaki thanks Bitcoin investors for not trusting ‘Den of Thieves’,"Robert Kiyosaki , the author of the personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ has expressed gratitude to Bitcoin ( BTC ) investors for refusing to place their trust in traditional financial institutions. The celebrity investor criticized these institutions, including the U.S. government, Treasury, and Federal Reserve, calling them a ‘Den of Thieves,’ he said in an X post on December 21. Kiyosaki, who also thanked investors in precious metals like gold and silver , accused the institutions of perpetrating wealth theft through the fiat monetary system. According to the financial educator, his distrust of the government began in 1965 when U.S. silver coins were replaced with copper alloys, which he viewed as a signal of the erosion of real monetary value. “THANK YOU gold, silver, and Bitcoin HODLERS: I do not trust the US Government, the US Treasury, or the FED. If you trust this Den of Thieves, that is your choice. I stopped trusting my government in 1965 when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of copper,” he said. Kiyosaki emphasized his belief that real wealth lies in tangible and decentralized assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Protecting wealth in financial crisis He also issued a grim forecast of a possible financial crash, urging investors to adopt his ‘rich dad’s’ philosophy of questioning traditional financial education and seeking guidance from wealthy individuals who prioritize wealth preservation. “If you do not being “ bent over” and your wealth is stolen via your fake money…. Keep being ignorant, working hard for fake money, and continue listening to financial planners who will tell you what to do with your fake money,” he added. As reported by Finbold, Kiyosaki has highlighted the importance of finding knowledgeable mentors to navigate high inflation and economic uncertainty in the U.S. Overall, the author has long been critical of traditional financial systems, blaming associated institutions for economic troubles such as rising inflation. Kiyosaki bullish on Bitcoin Furthermore, Kiyosaki maintains a bullish outlook on alternative investment assets like Bitcoin and precious metals. For instance, with Bitcoin surging to new highs above $100,000, Kiyosaki reiterated that it’s never too late to invest in the cryptocurrency, describing it as a coin ‘designed to make everyone rich,’ whether they are early adopters or latecomers. To this end, he predicts that the maiden cryptocurrency is likely to hit a high of $500,000 in 2025. He also views Bitcoin as a potential threat to the U.S. dollar, which he has termed ‘fake money, ’warning that the asset’s Bitcoin fixed supply could collapse the currency amid fears of ongoing devaluation. Meanwhile, Kiyosaki’s views on Bitcoin and traditional financial systems could be challenged. For instance, fiat currencies have been used to manage economies through central bank policies offering proven stability, flexibility, and regulatory oversight. On the other hand, while Bitcoin offers transferability, although still maturing, its volatility makes it a risky investment, unlike gold and silver, which require physical storage.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-exchange-listings-as-shib-and-pepe-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37928983,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631440,1734797876,"MicroStrategy expands board, appoints ex-Binance US CEO Brian Brooks","Business analytics software firm MicroStrategy has expanded its board, adding three new directors, including former Binance US CEO Brian Brooks. The appointment became public through the company filing of an 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With the move, MicroStrategy now has nine board members instead of the previous six. In addition to Brooks, the Bitcoin treasury-denominated firm also added Jane Dietze and Gregg Winiarksi to its board. Dietze is the chief investment officer for Brown University, while Winiarksi is the chief legal officer of Fanatics Holding. However, Brooks’ appointment has garnered the most attention due to his antecedents in the crypto and financial markets. Brooks, currently the chairman and CEO of Meridian Capital, has served in several key roles before, including being the Acting Comptroller of Currency and the Chief legal office of Coinbase. Many consider the addition of the three new executives to the MicroStrategy board a bullish sign for the company, noting their experience, background, and contributions in the investment and corporate law fields. Coindesk senior analyst James Van Straten describes the news as significant, stating: “Brian Brooks is huge.” MicroStrategy is planning to change its capital raise strategy Interestingly, the announcement of new board members comes after the firm announced plans to change its strategy for raising capital for its Bitcoin acquisitions. MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor said on Bloomberg TV that once it exhausts its current fundraising, MicroStrategy wants to focus more on using fixed-income securities like convertibles to raise capital for future Bitcoin purchases. The company has been raising capital using a combination of convertible bond sales and the issuance of new equity. This has allowed the company to raise over $20 billion of the $42 billion it has planned to spend on Bitcoin acquisition over the next three years. MicroStrategy has already sold two-thirds of its equity and about one-third of its planned convertible debt. However, Saylor believes that most of the convertible bonds it has issued are more of equity than debts, suggesting he is concerned about overdiluting its equity. He said: “We have $7.2 billion dollars of converts, but $4 billion of them are essentially equity, they’re through the strike price, the call price, and they are trading with a delta of approximately 100%, they are looking like equity. We would like to go back and build more intelligent leverage for the benefit of our common stock shareholders.” With the change in strategy, there have been speculations that the company might pause its Bitcoin acquisition in January 2025. So far, the company has been buying Bitcoin every week of December, making its acquisitions a norm. MicroStrategy continues to outperform Bitcoin Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy continues to prove successful as Bitcoin continues to perform above expectations. MSTR stock has even outperformed BTC this year, seeing a 476% gain year-to-date compared to Bitcoin’s 122% gains. However, Bitcoin recent dip to $95,000 also affected MicroStrategy MSTR value. The plunge in BTC price was enough to trigger some concerns about whether MicroStrategy approach of using debt to buy Bitcoin might haunt it later in the future. However, experts believe any concern about MicroStrategy being overexposed is exaggerated as it only has $7 billion in debt, compared to $46 billion in Bitcoin. As CryptoQuant CEO observed, an asteroid would have to hit the earth for MicroStrategy to go bankrupt Nevertheless, the tide seems to have turned for Bitcoin, with the asset gaining 2% in the last 24 hours and now above $98,000. Many expect the recent dip to be followed by a massive surge, noting that it could be the last chance to buy below $100,000. Market is super excited about buying Bitcoin dip (Source: Santiment) Santiment observed that this is the most enthusiastic people have been about buying the dip in the last eight months. Santiment analysts noted that the last time the market saw this level of enthusiasm about buying the dip was on August 4th after a major price crash, and the BTC market cap is up 81% since then.

Table of Contents DOGEN: The alpha memetoken for champions who always win POPCAT: A new meme coin with market revival potential Turbo token: AI-created memecoin with community focus Mew: A unique cryptocurrency with a feline focus BOME: A memecoin merging culture and decentralized tech Conclusion The crypto world is buzzing with new meme coins that could deliver massive returns. These playful yet promising tokens are catching attention with their explosive growth potential. Some fresh contenders are already making waves, hinting at gains that could skyrocket beyond imagination just in time for the holiday season. Curious? The details might be surprising. DOGEN: The alpha memetoken for champions who always win Picture this: luxury cars, towering stacks of cash, and a life that turns heads everywhere. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle — a realm where winners reign supreme. Those who’re always leveling up and thriving on the next big move, DOGEN is their token.

Get in early, take the lead, and watch the crowd struggle to catch up while you’re already miles ahead. Missed BONK, Popcat, or Ponke? As the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, DOGEN is poised to outshine big names like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, which have all delivered massive 1000% gains. Currently flying under the radar, DOGEN is on the verge of setting new benchmarks in this bull run. Don’t blink — interested inventors wouldn’t want this opportunity to pass them by.

With a bull run on the horizon, DOGEN holders are destined to lead the charge into a new era of crypto dominance. POPCAT: A new meme coin with market revival potential POPCAT is a meme-based cryptocurrency aiming to attract attention in a slow market. It claims to offer an alternative for users who missed out on previous big gains like BONK. The project presents itself as a fresh opportunity in a space often filled with inactive wallets and failed projects. POPCAT positions itself as a fun, engaging coin while highlighting its potential for significant market growth. Its appeal lies in capturing user interest during uncertain cycles. Whether it stands out or not depends on community backing and market trends. Turbo token: AI-created memecoin with community focus Turbo Token is the first memecoin designed using AI. It was created as an experiment by using GPT-4, aiming to show how artificial intelligence can be applied in cryptocurrency. The coin builds on the popularity of memecoins by combining AI innovation with community-driven value. Turbo Token’s unique origin makes it a standout in the market, particularly for those interested in AI’s role in finance. Its success depends on community adoption and current market conditions. The idea of an AI-created cryptocurrency attracts attention, especially in a market cycle where innovation is emphasized. Turbo Token represents an intersection of technology and culture within the crypto space. Mew: A unique cryptocurrency with a feline focus Mew is a cryptocurrency themed around a cat navigating a market dominated by dog-related coins. It aims to stand out with a distinct identity and engage users through its creative concept. The coin seeks to build its own ecosystem while addressing gaps in the current market of meme coins. Its potential lies in offering differentiation and novelty in an oversaturated meme coin space. Whether Mew is an attractive option depends on market conditions, competition, and development progress. BOME: A memecoin merging culture and decentralized tech BOME, or the Book of Meme, is an experimental project combining memes, blockchain storage, and cryptocurrency trading. It uses decentralized platforms like Arweave, IPFS, and plans to expand to Bitcoin inscriptions for permanent storage. The project aims to preserve and celebrate meme culture through its BOME token on the Solana blockchain. By creating an unstoppable collection of digital content, it explores new possibilities for decentralized social media and online culture. The unique blend of creativity, technology, and community engagement positions the coin as an intriguing concept in the crypto market. Its appeal largely depends on user interest in meme culture and the broader market’s performance. Conclusion POPCAT, TURBO, MEW, and BOME show some promise but may offer limited short-term potential. DOGEN, however, stands out as the ultimate token for those pursuing excellence. With expected 700% growth during the presale and massive returns ahead, it combines luxury, success, and community strength, following the footsteps of past winners like BONK and WIF .

37929581,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoin-etf-break-inflow-streak-as-market-turmoil-deepen/,1734797107,Bitcoin ETFs Break Inflow Streak as Market Turmoil Deepen,"The once-celebrated inflow streak of US Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) abruptly halted this week. After Bitcoin’s sharp price drop, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and Fidelity’s FBTC saw record-breaking outflows, hinting at declining institutional confidence. This marks a sharp turn from months of bullish growth driven by Bitcoin’s rally and hopes for a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. A Sudden Shift in Bitcoin ETF Dynamics US Spot Bitcoin ETFs were on a winning streak for over two weeks, raking in steady inflows that symbolized growing confidence in the world’s largest crypto. On December 18, this streak ended. On December 19, 2024, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a staggering net outflow of approximately $671.9 million. This marked the largest single-day withdrawal since their inception earlier this year. This trend continued the following day, with an additional outflow of around $277 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led the withdrawals, experiencing an outflow of $208.6 million, followed by Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust with $188.6 million. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF recorded its largest single-day outflow of $72.7 million, and Ark Invest’s ARKB was no exception. The correlation between Bitcoin’s price and ETF flows shows that institutional investors reevaluate their investments due to economic factors. The end of a 16-day inflow streak highlights the impact of these changes. It also shows how sensitive the crypto market is to broader economic shifts. Market Volatility and Investor Sentiment These notable outflows happened alongside a drop in Bitcoin’s price below $100,000, triggered by the Federal Reserve’s cautious policy stance. This shift affected investor confidence in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Despite the short-term volatility, Bitcoin remains a focal point for institutional and corporate players. Companies like MicroStrategy continue to expand their BTC holdings. At the same time, miners such as Marathon Holdings and Hut 8 have doubled down on their accumulation strategies. Reportedly, investors in Bitcoin have refused to sell their coins despite the sharp price decline. This shows resilience amid the market’s current challenges. Additionally, Bitcoin is gaining attention globally, with Europe, Russia, and Japan considering a Bitcoin reserve similar to that of the US. Despite short-term market fluctuations testing investor confidence, these moves highlight Bitcoin’s growing importance as a strategic asset. A Temporary Setback or a New Trend? According to market analysts, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains robust despite the turbulence. Analysts think the current pullback is a temporary setback caused by short-term recent market conditions. Bitcoin’s resilience is clear as it rebounded 6.11% to $98,232 after dropping to $92,175 in the last 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data . However, CoinGlass data shows that Bitcoin Futures’ open interest remains low, indicating caution among investors.

Technical indicators show a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 33.01 and a Stochastic value of 18.52, both suggesting that the coin may be oversold. The nearest support level is at $0.00001798, with resistance at $0.00003144. If the price holds above support and gains upward momentum, it could challenge the resistance levels. Market participants are closely monitoring these indicators for potential shifts in the coin’s trajectory. Dogecoin nears oversold territory: Potential for bullish reversal ahead Dogecoin is trading between $0.3588 and $0.4603, consolidating after recent declines. The Relative Strength Index is below 40, approaching oversold levels, hinting at a possible rebound. The price is near the 100-day Simple Moving Average around $0.3701, which may act as support. Breaking the nearest resistance at $0.5145 could propel DOGE toward the next level near $0.6160. Despite a drop of nearly 30% in the past week, Dogecoin has gained over 130% in the last six months. This pullback might be a prime opportunity before a bullish run in the upcoming altcoin season. Conclusion While PEPE and DOGE show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale, triple utility features, and a mission to unite enthusiasts against crypto villains, Catzilla invites participation to achieve new heights together.

The Funding Rate, which reflects the balance between buyers and sellers, tends to rise when optimism dominates the market. A high Funding Rate usually indicates an increase in long positions as traders expect further price increases. However, Alphractal’s analysis points to an interesting deviation in current market behavior. While the Funding Rate remains high, Bitcoin’s price has begun to fall. The company outlines three possible explanations for this phenomenon: Over-Optimism: A wave of longs entered the market during Bitcoin’s recent price rally, inflating the Funding Rate. However, the lack of sustained buying pressure triggered a price correction. Selling Pressure: Long holders taking profits or strategically entering short positions at high Funding Rate levels may have caused prices to pull back. Short-Term Support: Despite the decline, a positive Funding Rate indicates market confidence. A stabilization or further decline in the Funding Rate could provide clues about a potential shift in sentiment. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor Shares Draft to Spark Bitcoin Revolution in the US Alphractal warns that the combination of a persistently high Funding Rate and falling prices could increase the risk of liquidation in the market. Tracking the trajectory of the Funding Rate could be crucial to predicting Bitcoin’s next moves. *This is not investment advice.

37928000,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631617,1734796201,Nigeria SEC to unveil new laws to regulate crypto influencers,"The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced new laws that will regulate the practices of crypto influencers in the country. This new regulation represents an update to the previous rules governing the industry. Per the new development, all crypto platforms must obtain a license from the body before they can carry out any promotional activities. This includes promotion across TV, radio, social media, and other print media. As part of the requirements, crypto influencers are mandated to disclose any financial benefits they enjoy for promoting a platform or asset. The statement revealed that non-compliance could land perpetrators a 10 million naira fine or up to three years in jail. The new regulation will take effect on June 30, 2025. The new SEC laws have been seen as a needed purge for the crypto industry in Nigeria, removing exploitative practices. Nigeria SEC law on crypto influencers explained According to the document titled “Specific Requirements for Third-Party and Social Media Promotions,” any crypto company that wants to engage the services of influencers must first forward a written letter to the commission. The SEC also said the influencers must adhere strictly to the rules set out, noting that the platform must ensure that the rules are followed. The commission mentioned that the influencers involved must first provide a detailed copy of the agreement letter before it is endorsed. They must also ensure that the products and platforms that they intend to influence have obtained all the needed license from the needed licenses from the commission. Influencers are also mandated to reveal to their followers if they were paid for their services or kit before carrying out the said service. Finally, the SEC said it will continue to monitor promotional activities in the sector to ensure that they are in line with the Commission’s regulations. In the case that any company or influencer is caught in violation of its rules, the SEC said it will sanction the affected parties which will include financial penalties and other sanctions. The commission also promised to carry out a periodic review of its rules to ensure they are in line with global trends, promoting innovation in the industry. Industry experts discuss the Nigeria SEC’s new rule Prominent crypto analysts have discussed the new rule, with most of them giving their honest reviews about its flaws. One such is crypto educator Rume Ophi. According to Ophi, the new laws will ensure integrity in the industry, noting it as a step forward. “Before now, the industry had seen numerous instances of bad actors exploiting the lack of regulation, leading individuals to significant financial losses. Introducing a policy that requires promotions to come from licensed entities will significantly reduce the number of questionable projects being advertised,” Ophi said. According to Ophi, there is always a case of most technology industries being threatened by bad actors, and the crypto industry is not an exception. As such, there is a need to establish the needed laws to check the activities of the people promoting entities and products in the sector. In addition, the SEC Chairman has expressed his gratitude to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his pro-crypto stance and support for the industry. He mentioned that his appointment as the SEC Chair was made possible through the influence of the president. According to the SEC, two crypto firms, Busha and Quidax are the first firms to secure a license of operation in the country, highlighting a new crypto atmosphere in the country. Meanwhile, the government’s perception of crypto remains relatively unknown. While there is a ban on the assets, the country has ranked as one with the highest adoption rate in the continent. However, most of these transactions happen via peer-to-peer, with most banks unwilling to provide their services to crypto platforms citing the government’s orders.

Ethena ( ENA ) token retreated to $1.10, down from an intraday high of $1.2240. It has dropped by over 16% from its highest level this month. Data by Nansen shows that Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, moved 7 million tokens worth $8.47 million to Binance. Moving a cryptocurrency from a self-custody wallet is usually a sign that a crypto investor is selling. According to Arkham , Hayes now owns 7.19 million ENA tokens worth over $8.5 million. His other portfolio assets include Ethereum ( ETH ), Wilder World, Pendle ( PENDLE ), and Ethena Staked USDe. Hayes’ selling came a few days after Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance acquired 741,687 ENA tokens valued at $823,000. Ethena has now proposed a deeper collaboration with WLFI , a move that could see sUSDe integrated in the upcoming DeFi platform. The total value locked in Ethena’s ecosystem in the form of USDe stablecoin jumped to over $6 billion for the first time. This growth has made it the third-biggest stablecoin in the crypto industry after Tether and USD Coin.

Meanwhile, Polymarket users believe that the USDe stablecoin will not lose its $1 peg this year. According to the site, odds of the coin falling below 90 cents. The odds of it losing its peg were almost 20% in May as analysts compared it with Terra. Ethena also recently launched USDtb , a new stablecoin backed by asset manager BlackRock, which boasts over $11.5 trillion in assets.

The coin has moved above the 50-day moving average and the psychological level at $1.00. There are signs that it is forming a cup and handle pattern whose top is at $1.5197. Therefore, a move above this month’s high of $1.3275 will increase the odds of the coin rising to $1.5197, which is about 42% above the current level.

YouTube has been censoring content that violates its policy, and some people claim that it rides on the policy to censure voices that are against particular narratives, limiting freedom of speech. So Tether, in a bid to reinforce fundamental values, including freedom of speech and financial freedom, has settled on Rumble, citing that they don’t censor content. Rumble to use part of the investment for funding a self-tender According to Rumble, the partnership won’t interfere with their structures much. Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s chairman and CEO, will remain in charge of the company as he retains control. Tether’s investment will ensure it owns a minority position in Rumble’s outstanding common stock. The agreement means that Tether has no rights to designate any Rumble board member. Rumble will also use part of the investment to fund a self-tender offer for up to 70 million of Rumble’s common stock. The board of directors also gave a green light to investing excess cash reserves in Bitcoin to the tune of $20 million. Crypto frenzy has risen with the election of the US President, Donald Trump. His clear position in cryptocurrency and his ambitions to establish a Bitcoin reserve are motivating investors. Beyond shareholding arrangements, Tether hopes to carry out meaningful advertisements and enhance its cloud and crypto payment solutions relationship with Rumble. Tether investment to drive Rumble’s next step of growth Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski believes that the partnership with Tether is what they need for their next phase of growth. The platform aims to outdo its competitors by offering alternative and credible avenues for sharing uncensored information. According to Google Finance, the partnership announcement led to a 51.6% surge in Rumbles’ (RUM) share price to $10.90. The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, is exciting. Rumble may break its ceiling and consolidate users, and Tether will immensely benefit from adverts—a win-win solution. What will be interesting to watch is how Rumble will fare in its competition with YouTube.

According to a filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, 8,358 customers at Citizens Bank – which is the 16th-largest bank in the US by total assets – are impacted. The breach is attributed to “insider wrongdoing” believed to have happened on October 23rd of 2023. Citizens Bank says the breach involves highly sensitive customer information. “Information that may have been involved includes your Citizens account number(s), social security number, date of birth, or identification details.” The bank is offering affected customers a two-year membership to an identity theft credit monitoring service. The incident comes two months after the bank suffered a separate security breach. In October, Citizens Bank detailed a data breach that exposed the personal information of approximately 100 customers to an unauthorized party.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

While some might argue that meme coins are a bit of a gamble, there’s no denying that they’ve created immense wealth for early investors. In 2024, as more people turn their eyes to these digital currencies, some new coins are rising up to join the ranks of heavyweights like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. With so many options flooding the market, how do you decide which ones to keep an eye on? One of the most exciting developments right now is the launch of BTFD Coin (BTFD ), a new meme coin that’s making waves with its presale event. If you’ve been following the meme coin space, you know how quickly things can explode. The BTFD Coin presale has already raised over $4.2 million and continues to build momentum, offering early investors opportunities that could pay off handsomely. With features like a Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards offering up to 90% APY, and a killer referral program, BTFD Coin is one to watch. So, if you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in today, keep reading as we dive into the most promising projects, including the incredible presale of BTFD Coin. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Meme Coin to Watch in 2024 Let’s kick things off with BTFD Coin, an emerging star in the meme coin universe. While the presale is ongoing, BTFD Coin has already caught the eye of crypto enthusiasts with its unique features. As of now, the coin is in Stage 12 of its presale, priced at $0.00013, and the presale has already raised a staggering $4.2 million. That’s some serious traction! With over 57 billion coins sold to over 6,100 holders, the BTFD Coin presale is proving to be a hot ticket. Why is BTFD Coin generating so much buzz? Well, it’s not just about the price or the hype. BTFD Coin is bringing some serious value to the table. For starters, the Play 2 Earn game launched its beta version during Stage 10 of the presale. While rewards aren’t available in the beta, the game itself gives a sneak peek into what’s to come. The full launch of the P2E game will likely bring significant attention, especially as it ties into the overall vision for the project. The idea of earning while you play is always a big draw for investors and gamers alike, and BTFD Coin has capitalised on this trend in a big way. On top of the gaming aspect, BTFD Coin offers up to 90% APY through staking. Imagine staking your coins and earning passive rewards—sounds pretty tempting, right? This feature went live on December 2 and has already caught the attention of those looking to maximise their crypto holdings. Furthermore, BTFD Coin has a fantastic referral program, rewarding users who help spread the word. With all these benefits rolled into one, BTFD Coin has certainly carved a niche for itself. Why did this coin make it to this list? The combination of its presale success, innovative features like Play 2 Earn, high staking rewards, and an active referral program makes BTFD Coin one of the best new meme coins to invest in today . With so much happening, it’s clear that this project is gaining momentum quickly, and it’s only a matter of time before BTFD becomes a major player in the meme coin space. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The OG Meme Coin with Endless Potential Dogecoin (DOGE) isn’t exactly “new” by meme coin standards, but it’s one of the most well-established and widely recognised names in the meme coin world. Originally launched in 2013 as a joke, Dogecoin quickly found a massive following thanks to its lovable Shiba Inu mascot and strong community. Over the years, it has steadily gained in value, making it a serious player in the meme coin market. Despite its somewhat cheeky origins, Dogecoin has become a household name in crypto circles. It has even been endorsed by none other than Elon Musk, who frequently tweets about the coin and its potential. But what really makes Dogecoin stand out among the best new meme coins to invest in today is its resilience and community-driven growth. The Dogecoin community has always been active, with a group of passionate supporters who believe in the long-term success of the coin. Why did this coin make it to this list? While Dogecoin may not have the same flashy features as newer meme coins, its strong brand recognition, loyal community, and status as a frontrunner in the meme coin movement make it a solid choice for those looking to invest. It’s been around for over a decade, and its potential continues to grow as new projects and platforms adopt it for payments, tipping, and more. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – The “Doge Killer” That’s Gaining Traction Shiba Inu (SHIB) is another heavy hitter in the meme coin space, and it has positioned itself as a direct competitor to Dogecoin. Often referred to as the “Doge Killer,” SHIB has built a massive ecosystem around its token, with numerous projects and initiatives supporting its growth. The coin has attracted millions of investors, drawn by its promise of high returns and a strong, vibrant community. One of the major factors contributing to SHIB’s success is its burn mechanism, which helps reduce the total supply of coins over time. This deflationary approach is designed to create scarcity, which could potentially increase the value of each coin. SHIB has also launched several initiatives like the ShibaSwap, allowing users to stake their tokens and earn rewards. Additionally, SHIB has a significant presence in the world of NFTs, further solidifying its place in the crypto landscape. Why did this coin make it to this list? SHIB’s explosive growth and continued innovation have made it a major contender among the best new meme coins to invest in today. With its strong community, creative projects, and long-term vision, Shiba Inu is poised to continue attracting new investors. Final Thoughts: Is BTFD Coin the Next Big Thing? As meme coins continue to surge in popularity, there’s no shortage of exciting opportunities. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain stalwarts of the meme coin world, BTFD Coin is making waves with its innovative approach and presale success. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to invest in today, BTFD Coin’s presale offers an incredible chance to get in on the ground floor before it hits exchanges. With features like staking, Play 2 Earn, and a strong referral program, BTFD Coin is undeniably an exciting new player in the meme coin market.

37926549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666132,1734793213,Bitcoin Demand On The Rise Again — What’s Happening?,"This week was one of two distinct halves for the price of Bitcoin, with the premier cryptocurrency rising to a new all-time high and dropping by about 13% a few days later. On Friday, December 20, the BTC price dropped to as low as $92,000. This abrupt Bitcoin price decline came following the US Federal Reserve’s rate cut, which also pushed other financial markets to the red. However, it is worth mentioning that the premier cryptocurrency is beginning to show signs of recovery, currently hovering around $97,000. Can Growing Demand Push BTC Price Back Above $100,000? In a recent December 20 report, market analytics platform CryptoQuant revealed an interesting on-chain development with the Bitcoin supply-demand dynamics. According to the blockchain firm, the BTC market seems to be enjoying renewed investor interest. Related Reading: How Low Can Dogecoin Go Before It Rebounds? Expert Forecasts The relevant indicator here is the Total OTC Desk Balance, which tracks the amount of Bitcoin held in addresses associated with Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks. This metric provides an insight into the supply of BTC readily to large investors and institutional players. According to data from CryptoQuant, the OTC desks are witnessing their largest monthly inventory decline of 2024, declining by over 26,000 BTC so far in December. This decline has been even more significant in the past 30 days, with the balance dropping by 40,000 BTC since November 20. This decline in the Total OTC Desk Balance is a bullish indicator, which reflects the soaring demand for Bitcoin and the concurrently shrinking supply. Typically, the contracting BTC supply on the open market could set the stage for a period of significant price appreciation. CryptoQuant noted that the price of Bitcoin rallied from $40,000 to around $74,000 in the 2024 first quarter after demand growth caused the Over-The-Counter desks’ inventories to fall. According to the market intelligence, the OTC desk’s inventory is beginning to near the levels seen during the first-quarter rally. Data from CryptoQuant shows that Bitcoin’s apparent demand is currently growing at a monthly rate of 228,000 BTC after entering the expansion territory in late September. At the same time, the balance of accumulation addresses is swelling at a record-high rate of 495,000 BTC per month. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $97,655, reflecting a 0.1% decline in the past 24 hours. The premier cryptocurrency is down by nearly 4% on the weekly timeframe, according to data from CoinGecko.

Capital flows into Bitcoin investment products have surged, with $4.7 billion in December alone, highlighting Bitcoin's dominance in digital asset investments. Cycle indicators suggest Bitcoin's price may not have peaked yet, but technicals show bearish divergences and potential risks, urging caution. Despite fundamental concerns, I believe the current dip below $100k is a buyable opportunity, with potential for new highs in 2025. 2024 has been a truly terrific year for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Bitcoin proxies like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). Of particular importance was that three-letter addition to GBTC's fund name back in January. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by a kicking and screaming US Securities and Exchange Commission truly opened the floodgates of liquidity. Recently Bitcoin officially hit a six-figure price as many of us expected . Where do we go from here? Data by YCharts In this article, we'll look at updated capital flow numbers, cycle indicators, and basic technicals to assess what (if any) upside remains in this monstrous Bitcoin 131% year to date rally. Capital Flows Q4 has been an absolute monster for capital flows in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Coinshares now has the month to date net flow into Bitcoin investment products at just under $4.7 billion through December 14th. Per data from The Block, we can see at least an additional $1.7 billion has come into US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs between December 16-18th. Daily Spot BTC ETF Flows (The Block) These are enormous numbers. Especially when considering GBTC outflow really hasn't stopped this month. To be sure, the outflow from GBTC has slowed down dramatically since May, but even with the lower-priced option of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF ( BTC ), Grayscale's original ETF continues to see outflow: BTC Supply Through Grayscale ETFs (The Block) Grayscale's spot Bitcoin products held 250.18k BTC on November 30th. As of December 19th, that figure was down to 249.6 BTC. Bitcoin presses on. Not only does capital keep flowing into Bitcoin and other digital assets, but Bitcoin's share of that net flow continues to be enormous. As of December 14th, Bitcoin's $38.6 billion share of $44.5 billion in YTD digital asset net flow is a staggering 87%. It seems clear to me that in the eyes of Wall Street and the larger investment community, Bitcoin is still very much the favorite. Cycle Indicators In this section, it is important to remember that these are not forecasts or price targets. They are just indicators that we can use to determine if the price of Bitcoin is getting extended based on historical averages and multiples. I like to use some of them, but I also think it’s important to be selective because these tools can provide very different signals. We’ll go through a few of the ones that I personally like. First, the MVRV, or market value to realized value: Bitcoin MVRV (BGeometrics) This shows the premium in market price over the average price paid per coin by holders. Bitcoin's market value to realized value is presently 255% - which implies the average holder has a 155% gain on their cost basis. What's also important to point out is the Z-score, or deviation, of the MVRV from statistical norms. At at Z-score of 3.2, Bitcoin's MVRV isn't quite as extended as it could be, but it is important to keep in mind that each peak in BTC price has resulted in a lower high in MVRV through the years. Something else to consider is 97.6% of BTC holders are currently in profit: Bitcoin Holders in Profit (IntoTheBlock) Percentage of holders in profit in the high 90's is generally always something that leads peaks in price, even when short term. If Bitcoin is a game, there are brief periods where everyone is a winner. This is obviously not reality and always corrects. As is generally the case when Bitcoin moves to the magnitude that it has this year, HODLer balance has been in decline for most of the year. HODLers are defined as wallet addresses that haven't moved supply in 12 months. HODLer Balance (IntoTheBlock) In January the HODLer balance was 13.8 million BTC. That figure is currently 12.3 million BTC. HODLer balance is down roughly 11% from the peak earlier this year. This is very typical. HODLer balance declined by 14% between 2020 and 2021 and by 23% between 2017 and 2018. It's certainly possible the decline will be less extreme between 2024 and 2025. But until we see that HODLer balance start to move back up, I don't think we've seen the high in Bitcoin's price just yet. Historically, HODLers don't start reallocating until after the price has topped out. Finally, I want to share Checkmate's 'Euphoria Zone' chart: Euphoria Zone Chart (Checkonchain) This is a pricing model that utilizes several different indicators to identify when the market is in the ""euphoria zone."" As one would expect, when the market is euphoric it's typically a good time to start thinking about exiting trades. Bitcoin entered the euphoria zone in November. The only question remaining is how long euphoria can last. Bitcoin spent most of 2017 in euphoria and about 7 straight months in euphoria between November 2020 and May 2021. It's important to remember that none of this means anything will happen again in the same way that it has in the past. We are simply using these models as tools to make our own assessments on where price may go. Technicals are also important. Technical Opinion From a technical standpoint, I like to keep my analysis mainly to daily and weekly charts. I have some concerns about what I'm seeing on the daily: TrendSpider Here we find numerous bearish divergences in the RSI going back to mid-November. There was a divergent high on November 21st, December 5th, and another on December 16th. This was a clear warning sign. The good news is Bitcoin has not given up the 50 day moving average and has actually responded very well from a short-lived test of that MA. TrendSpider The weekly chart shows a perfect back-test of the 8 week. However, there are several concerns here as well. First, unless Bitcoin pulls off a drastic recovery over the next several days, the current weekly candle is highly bearish in my view. It's engulfing to the downside and it comes with an RSI that is falling out of overbought. My view has generally been that the 8 and 20 week MAs will tell the tale. Until we see a weekly close below the 8 week, I think dips are still buys for now. Risks I've been writing about Bitcoin on this website since 2019. Despite literally hundreds of articles covering BTC and crypto-related assets, it's still difficult for me to say that any price for Bitcoin is justifiable based on fundamental usage or utility. For instance, monthly active addresses hit their lowest level since 2016 in October 2024. Bitcoin Monthly Fees vs DAAs (Token Terminal) Despite sporadic surges, network fees make up a very small portion of miner incentive - which remains a long term issue for a fixed-supply asset. L2 solutions like Lightning Network have generally failed to scale the network. I see serious issues. Bitcoin is not perfect and is still very much an idea, in my view. But I've generally remained bullish because people keep buying it anyway. Is that a great reason to buy something? Probably not. But that hasn't mattered yet. Number go up. Final Takeaways In my opinion, this fall back under $100k per coin has been a necessary pullback and it's one that I think offers a buyable dip. I expect Bitcoin bulls are going to enjoy yet another pump to new highs in 2025 before this thing tops out for the cycle. I'm not going to attempt to guess what that top price will be, but I think it's going to be many years before Bitcoin sees a seven-figure coin price - if it happens at all. In my view, the ease with which investors can now allocate to Bitcoin can absolutely be a double edged sword. These ETFs are powering Bitcoin higher very quickly because investors are bullish. Downside speed is likely to be evident as well when sentiment turns bearish. Again, I don't think we've seen the top yet for this cycle based on both sentiment and many of the indicators I've provided. But that is just my opinion. I do think it would be wise for Bitcoiners to, at minimum, entertain the possibility that we have already seen the top for this cycle. The market's response to the latest FOMC has not been a good one and Bitcoin has been highly correlated to risk assets like the Qs. My approach to Bitcoin and its proxies has always been to take small chunks off when the market is ripping hard. I have personally lightened up since the coin hit $100k. But that is not stopping me from buying this dip below $93k with swing capital. Be careful out there. Don't forget to take profit. I hope everyone enjoys the holidays and has a happy new year.

Here’s what Peter Todd suggested,"The debate about Bitcoin remaining faithful to its cypherpunk principles has heated up, as critics claim that its potential for decentralization and anti-control is disappearing. Meanwhile, Peter Todd, one of the coin’s developers, suggests “tail emission” as an alternative. The basis of the cypherpunk movement underlines strong cryptography and privacy tools to protect individual rights and promote a decentralized society. It combines the word “cypher” as in encryption, with “punk” as a symbol for a rebellious, do-it-yourself spirit. This movement has played an important role in shaping the internet, especially key technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s creation also brings the cypherpunk movement closer to its goal of building tech for digital privacy, security, and independence. Recently, BlackRock questioned BTC’s fixed 21 million supply limit. It contained a disclaimer: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” Micro Strategy’s CEO, Micheal Saylor, who is one of the top BTC holders, also retweeted the video.

Serious questions have been raised over the cryptocurrency’s capacity to bear long to its ethos due to the growing capitalist influence of corporate players. Peter Todd suggested ‘tail emission’ for Bitcoin back in 2022 Another critic on X, @sebp888, criticized renowned Bitcoin developers, including Adam Back and Peter Todd, for remaining silent about these issues. He argued that Bitcoin’s community should fight back against the perceived growing corporate domination. Peter Todd shared the screenshot of the community note with his article. Source: X Peter Todd retweeted the tweet with a screenshot showing a community note under Sebastian’s post. The note pointed toward Todd’s article from 2022: “Surprisingly, Tail Emission Is Not Inflationary.” In this piece , Todd contemplated the threats Bitcoin could face when it ditches block rewards in favor of transaction fees for miners’ incentives. This could happen after all of the Bitcoin supply has been mined. He warned that such a shift could be unstable. “To date, no proof-of-work currency has ever operated solely on transaction fees, and academic analysis has found that in this condition, block generation is unstable.” He suggested an alternative like Monero’s implementation of tail emission, in which miners receive a fixed, small reward per block forever. Lost Bitcoins naturally balance out the continuously emitted coins According to Todd, this model doesn’t cause inflation but rather creates a stable supply. He also said lost coins naturally balance out the continuously emitted coins. Thus, in the long run, coins are created just as fast as they are lost,” Todd said. He explained it through mathematical modeling by which he proved that fixed rewards in combination with natural coin loss yield a stable monetary system. One user on X, @LibreHans , doubted Peter Todd’s prediction. He said, “You think you can predict the future? How could anybody take you seriously?” Todd replied rather sarcastically that losing coins can only “magically” stop in the future. However, his article also points out how difficult it would be to implement such changes on Bitcoin. Todd noted that a hard fork to enable it would likely mean not winning consensus from the large and diverse Bitcoin community. “While Monero was able to get sufficiently broad consensus in the community to implement tail emission, it’s unclear at best if it would ever be possible to achieve that for the much larger Bitcoin,” he wrote.

37926087,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27804,1734792207,French Regulator Authorizes Crypto Operations for BPCE Subsidiary Hexarq,"Introduction France’s financial markets regulator , Autorité des Marchés Financiers, or AMF, has just given a license to Hexarq, the crypto subsidiary of BPCE, as an officially registered crypto asset service provider, CASP. In fact, this makes Hexarq only the second banking crypto operation in France to be licensed as such, following Société Générale’s Forge. This move is an important milestone for the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies in European banking. Hexarq: The Expansion of BPCE in Crypto Launched in January 2021, Hexarq focuses on the provision of cryptocurrency services and management of tokenized real-world assets. With its CASP authorization, Hexarq is now allowed to provide crypto custody, buying, selling, and trading services, including euro-crypto exchanges. The company will merge its services into BPCE’s top banking networks, Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne, by 2025. This would make services accessible to BPCE’s 35 million customers, placing Hexarq among the key players in leading the adoption of digital assets among the European banking system. A Major Milestone for European Banking The foray of BPCE into cryptocurrency space reflects the increasing momentum in the traditional banking world embracing digital finance. Given that BPCE had $1.3 trillion in assets under management as of September 2024, many consider its involvement to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption across Europe. With the integration of Hexarq soon, millions of customers will be able to safely access and invest in cryptocurrencies through a trusted banking platform. Limited CASP Authorizations Signal Regulatory Caution Hexarq is the fourth crypto business to receive CASP authorization from the AMF. Other authorized entities include Société Générale’s Forge, Deblock SAS, and GOin SAS. The French regulator’s cautious approach emphasizes thorough vetting ahead of the full implementation of EU-wide Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which will take effect on December 30, 2024. In August 2024, AMF began to take applications for CASPs in line with MiCA. The number of authorizations is still limited and thus indicates the regulator’s desire for compliance and consumer safety in an emerging industry . Conclusion The AMF approval of Hexarq marks a very important milestone not only for BPCE but for the entire financial industry in general. Such a blend of traditional banking with crypto services places BPCE in a position to drive great innovation in the European financial space, bridging conventional finance and the fast-growing digital economy.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/french-regulator-authorizes-crypto-operations-bpce/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

The notice raises concerns about the platform’s integration of its ERC-20 token with blockchain games and questions aspects of its activities, including its 2021 contract migration. The SEC’s Argument In a post on X, the CyberKongz team expressed their dismay with the agency’s handling of the situation, saying: “We are extremely disappointed at the approach the SEC has taken towards us, but we are going to stand up and fight for a brighter future that holds more clarity for NFT projects.” They disclosed that the issue began two years ago when the regulator first contacted them, during which time they operated quietly and under a lot of pressure. The post highlighted that the SEC’s main concern appears to center on whether ERC-20 tokens can function alongside blockchain games without being classified as securities. CyberKongz argued that this implication could have wide-ranging consequences for the Web3 gaming industry. They also said they are determined to contest the financial watchdog’s position and advocate for a clearer regulatory framework. Another point of contention involves the Genesis Kongz contract migration in April 2021, which the regulator reportedly interpreted as a token sale. The NFT project clarified that the migration was not a primary sale and criticized the SEC’s inability to differentiate between the two, stating: “If they cannot distinguish between a primary sale and a contract migration, what hope do we currently have for a clear regulatory pathway going forward?” The Wells Notice gives the platform 30 days to respond before the SEC decides whether to pursue enforcement action. While not a formal allegation of wrongdoing, such a notice shows that the agency is considering further legal steps. Broader Industry Issue This latest development adds CyberKongz to a growing list of blockchain and NFT entities under SEC scrutiny, including Coinbase, Consensys, Ripple, OpenSea, Uniswap Labs , and Bittrex , which have faced similar notices in recent years. Last month, Australian-based gaming company Immutable also reported receiving such a warning. At the time, they expressed frustrations over vague allegations and unclear regulatory guidelines. However, no further action has been taken since then. Meanwhile, CyberKongz has reassured its community that it remains committed to advancing its work without the burden of silence. It stated that the situation marks a turning point as it continues to advocate for clearer guidelines within the NFT and blockchain industries.

Memecoins Surge As per data from Coingecko, BONK surged 30%, while Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Dogwifhat and Floki Inu surged as much as 20%. Notably, the dog-themed tokens, on average, saw an 8% increase in value over the past 24 hours, outpacing the overall market, which rose by 4.5% Memecoins characterized by high volatility, often outperforms major tokens during price rallies, acting as a leveraged bet on the overall crypto market sentiment. Recently, Floki was recognized by the U.S. CFTC as an example of a utility token. FLOKI – A Utility Token The token was noted during the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting on Nov. 21, where the focus was on providing clarity for digital asset markets. The committee highlighted Floki for its growing ecosystem, especially Valhalla, a blockchain-based metaverse game launching in 2025. FLOKI will be the primary currency in the game, enabling players to earn and spend it, which supports its classification as a utility token. Notably, tokens that provide immediate practical use like Floki’s role in Valhalla are being acknowledged as non-security commodities. The subcommittee outlined that utility tokens must offer “immediate, non-incidental consumptive use” to qualify. FLOKI Ecosystem Sees Growth Floki’s ecosystem has seen significant growth over the past year, with the launch of Valhalla, a metaverse game, and FlokiFi, a DeFi platform for asset locking. Besides, Floki’s developers introduced Floki University, an educational initiative aimed at enhancing blockchain literacy. Floki’s lead developer noted that this puts Floki on an entirely different level from other memecoins, especially when the market turns and people start to pay attention to fundamentals again. On the other side, Interest in BONK is rising as efforts to reduce its token supply gain momentum. BonkDAO burned 100 billion tokens in November and plans to burn a trillion tokens in December, which could increase the token’s value due to scarcity.

37925953,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631512,1734791104,Crypto companies fund Trump’s inauguration in millions: Strategic investment or regulatory favoritism?,"Cryptocurrency companies are making significant financial contributions to Trump’s inauguration, with major figures like Ripple, Kraken, and Coinbase leading the way. However, there are questions about the nature of these multi-million-dollar donations, whether they are strategic moves or borderline bribery. Cryptocurrency companies are donating a lot of money to President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration, with big names like Kraken, Coinbase, and Ripple pitching in. The crypto industry is hoping to build a good relationship with the incoming administration. But the big question is: are these donations a smart investment in the future of digital currencies, or are these companies just trying to gain favor to secure better regulations for themselves? Massive donations from crypto giants Ripple is winning the race with a donation of $5 million in XRP tokens to President Trump’s inauguration committee. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, said, “We believe in supporting initiatives that help drive innovation and technology forward.” Kraken, another major crypto exchange, also committed to donate $1 million. Ondo Finance follows the path by committing $1 million after a Trump-linked DeFi project invested $250,000 in the ONDO token. Founder Tim Drapper said, “We’re happy to support an administration that understands the value of digital assets.” Coinbase and MoonPay also joined in, with Coinbase donating $1 million even before the election results. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, said, “This donation shows our commitment to building relationships with policymakers who understand the future of finance.” Crypto companies started donating as far back as during the campaign. Elon Musk, who supports cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, played a major role in backing Trump. His support helped bring attention to digital currencies during the campaign. Ripple’s donations during the campaign were a strategic move to make sure the new administration understood the crypto industry. These donations were part of a larger effort that raised over $200 million for Trump’s inauguration, breaking previous fundraising records. While companies like Amazon and Meta also contributed majorly. Why the crypto industry is all in for Trump The main reason behind these donations is the crypto industry needs clearer rules. For a long time, crypto companies have faced uncertainty about the legal status of digital assets in the U.S. Agencies like the SEC have muddled up the regulatory waters. Trump’s pro-business approach and promises to reduce regulations make him a key figure for the crypto industry. Coinbase is committed to working with the Administration and both sides of Congress to create regulatory clarity for crypto, said Kara Calvert, Coinbase’s VP for U.S. Policy. “That’s why we committed to supporting President Trump’s transition and ultimately his inauguration well ahead of the election.” During his campaign, Trump hinted at making regulations less strict, which made him appealing to crypto leaders who feel that President Biden’s policies are restrictive. Many of the donations came in even before the election results were out, which could be interpreted as these companies strategically aligning themselves with Trump’s administration early on. Crypto-friendly appointments The crypto industry’s support for Trump has been repaid early with notable appointments in his administration. Trump has picked Paul Atkins, a known crypto supporter, to lead the SEC. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse praised the appointment, hoping it will lead to less strict regulation compared to the outgoing SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler. Trump also appointed David Sacks as the first-ever “crypto and AI czar,” showing that his administration is friendly towards digital assets. However, that appointment may face some uncertainties according to recent reports . With over $200 million pledged already, these donations show the crypto sector wants a strong relationship with Trump’s government. The timing and size of these donations suggest a strategic move to influence future regulations. While it’s unclear if this will lead to the changes they hope for, one thing is certain: the crypto industry is making its voice heard, investing heavily in securing a more favorable business environment under Trump.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-solana-memecoin-to-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

He dumped $8.4 million worth of Ethena’s ENA tokens on Binance, just two hours after praising the project in a tweet. Between November 26 and 28, Arthur quietly built up a position of 16.79 million ENA tokens at $0.67 per token, worth $11.21 million at the time. And now, he’s cashing out while the token sits at $0.7015, netting a tidy profit of $7.7 million. Arthur still holds 9.96 million ENA, valued at $11.7 million, with 7.94 million staked. His current holdings have already delivered an overall profit of $8.71 million—up 78%. Ethena’s wild ride: Price spikes, tweets, and chaos ENA has been on a rollercoaster ride, partly thanks to Arthur. Before his dump, the token surged over 25% in a week, hitting $0.7015 on December 21, fueled by rising demand and speculation. On Twitter, he wrote , “I could nitpick some things, but a very impressive rundown on Ethena Labs. If you are a DeFi protocol and you haven’t integrated USDe or sUSDe, you are f—ing up.” His comments section has descended into chaos. People are calling him a clown and bringing up allegations of insider trading and market manipulation. This is not the first time Arthur has faced these accusations. Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, has been a key selling point for the platform. In one week, it generated a jaw-dropping 67% yield for stakers, making traditional stablecoins like Tether look outdated. You can’t deny that Arthur’s endorsement added credibility to the project, even if his actions later rattled confidence. But don’t get it twisted—this wasn’t charity. Arthur knows how to cash out when the timing’s right, as we’re seeing. Arthur’s history and BitMEX’s dirty laundry Arthur’s reputation as a sharp trader comes with a side of legal baggage. BitMEX was once a powerhouse in crypto derivatives trading, but it also faced accusations of running an “Insider Trading Desk.” Allegedly, employees had “God Access” to accounts, letting them profit off private customer data. Critics say this turned the market into a playground for insiders while leaving ordinary traders exposed. If that wasn’t enough, BitMEX has also been accused of manipulating index prices on low-liquidity exchanges to trigger liquidations. The accusations painted a picture of a company willing to crush its own users for a buck. Arthur and his co-founders got hit with lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) charged them with violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, alleging that BitMEX “facilitated illegal trading and lacked proper anti-money laundering protocols.” A U.S. court refused to dismiss a class-action lawsuit against BitMEX in April, keeping allegations of price manipulation and insider trading alive as of press time.

Solana (SOL) is one such example, which at one point returned a staggering amount to those whose average starting investment sat at $0.50. Now, Rexas Finance (RXS) seems to be following the same path and allowing investors to brace themselves for great rewards. With prices at $0.15 during its presale, it is gaining popularity for its targeted market and niche aspects. Would a $500 stake in Rexas Finance return $250,000 worth of portfolio in no time? Read on to learn more. Whales Have Accumulated RXS Solana’s Surge: A Crypto Success Story Solana’s success can teach investors how to spot the next big opportunity in the crypto world. The SOL token was sold at $0.50, and its value shot up to a massive $234.08, giving a high return for its early investors. Its initial vision of the project being able to handle rapid and cheap transactions paved the way for its growth. Solana attracts investment and businesses, but more importantly, it also solves critical issues in the blockchain ecosystem, which means pursuing success. Combining market trends and innovation in business relevance to develop a winning approach enabled Solana to reach growth previously unseen by many during its early stages, making its investors among the luckiest in crypto history. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Rising Star in Blockchain Innovation Rexas Finance (RXS) is a suitable token for following Solana’s footsteps. It stands as one of the leaders in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) since Rexas Finance is able to consolidate tangible assets like real estate, art, and commodities with blockchain technology. The project's vision is simple: to provide liquidity and safety to asset ownership on blockchain. Rexas Finance is at its 10th presale stage, with a target of $33.1 million. It has raised $28.9 million and sold over 351 million tokens so far. Investors who bought into the token early on have seen it rise 400% since the presale started at $0.03. Considering the current price of $0.15, RXS is definitely the right time to invest if you wish to invest in a project that is expected to rise significantly. The $500 Investment Hypothesis If you bought about 3,333 RXS tokens right now for $0.15, you would have spent $500. By 2025, an RXS token could be worth $75. With a $500 stake, the expected return would be $249,975. This is all possible due to the rapid growth of the ecosystem and the RWA market, which currently have untapped potential. This sort of projection should interest high-risk investors. The historical record of crypto projects gives many reasons to believe in the above projection. Solana, for example, moved from $0.50 to over $230 in a very short time, which shows how remarkable growth can still happen to projects with a good market position. Rexas Finance has several characteristics that indicate a high market position, which puts the price target of $75 within reach. What Drives the Potential for Massive Gains? Rexas Finance holds great capacities as it pays significant attention to digitizing real-world assets. The project meets an essential need for building liquidity and widening accessibility in the global market by allowing a great division of real-world tangible assets. This utility is coupled with its diverse ecosystem, which enhances its usefulness by including NFT tools, token minting software, and yield optimization. Rexas Finance's investors' confidence has also been greatly improved. Certik vigorously audited its smart contracts, strengthening its focus on integrity and clarity. The token will soon be listed on platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. In addition, the project has successfully built strong and reliable bases and users thanks to its community engagement initiatives, such as the $1 million giveaway. This growing, persistent community will greatly aid demand growth and the adoption of the RXS tokens as the project continues scaling up. Conclusion Rexas Finance is a potential game changer in how assets are owned, bought, and sold. The success of its presale and the roadmap's practicality show that Rexas Finance is a good investment for those interested in high returns.

Despite this sharp decline, key on-chain data from Santiment highlights that whales are capitalizing on the dip. According to Santiment data, large holders have accumulated an additional 110 million XRP in the last day, signaling strong confidence in the asset’s potential. XRP whale purchases – Source: Santiment The activity of whales during XRP’s price drop suggests a calculated approach to long-term gains. Historically, significant whale accumulation during periods of negative market sentiment has often preceded a recovery. Currently, per Coinmarketcap data, XRP’s price is consolidating within the range of $2.00 to $2.90, following a brief dip to $1.96. Analysts believe this consolidation could signal a potential breakout. However, XRP’s price remains 27% below its multi-year high of $2.90, echoing the challenges the asset faces in the short term. Analysts: XRP’s key support levels remain intact Ripple’s native coin has managed to hold above a critical support level of $1.90, which analysts regard as the bulls’ last line of defense. Maintaining this level is crucial for preserving the bullish structure that has defined XRP’s recent price action. The resilience of this support zone provides a glimmer of stability amid broader market uncertainty. The crypto’s recent price movement has been marked by sharp declines and subsequent recoveries. Over 36 hours, the asset plummeted to under $2.25, losing nearly 20% of its value. The situation worsened as the coin fell below $2 for only the third time since December 1, marking a 28% drop from Tuesday’s high of $2.72 to a low of $1.96 by the end of Friday. However, the bulls intervened at this critical juncture, halting further losses and sparking a rebound. The token has since recovered approximately 13%, currently trading between the $2.25 and $2.30 levels. XRP/USDT price chart. Source: TradingView According to crypto analyst Dark Defender, the charts indicate a potential turning point. Observations of a “double tap” on the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) and price, coupled with a “tremendous bullish pin” on the daily chart, suggest that the asset may have bottomed and could be poised for further gains.

When can XRP reach $4? Meanwhile, analysts have expressed varying opinions on XRP’s chances of reaching $5. Some experts like Antonio Di Giacomo of XS.com speculated that the asset could reach $3 by the end of 2024. Hani Abuagla, an analyst at the exchange platform XTB, highlighted the wide range of predictions for Ripple’s native coin future. While optimistic scenarios see the price soaring to $100, more conservative estimates project $5, a level that would still mark a doubling of XRP’s current value. Abuagla’s optimism stems from expectations that President-elect Donald Trump’s administration may ease regulatory scrutiny on digital assets and Ripple’s continued progress in cross-border payments. However, he also cautioned that the coin’s long-term price outlook remains highly uncertain, with significant volatility likely ahead.

To elaborate, since July 2023, the currency has seen its value rise from $0.005 to $0.17, indicating a growth of 3,300% . $ZIG’s financial ascent over the last 18 months (source: Coingecko) $ZIG’s ongoing financial ascent can be traced back to a host of community-building initiatives and partnerships. For instance, on Nov 30, the ZIGChain team concluded its largest ever ‘Buyback & Burn’ to date, with over $146,000 worth of $ZIG (approx. 903,410 ZIG) being eliminated from the token’s supply pool — thus creating scarcity and augmenting demand for the asset. In fact, during November, a total burn volume of $268,000+ was witnessed while earlier this year, a sizable 6.4 million $ZIG Coins (worth approx. $80,000) were burnt, bringing the total $ZIG burned to date to 41,059,555. In a recent tweet explaining the purpose of these burns, co-founder Abdul Gafit Rafay explained:“[Zignaly’s] AUM is nearing new highs and it’s all a grand setup transitioning towardsZigchain with all this AUM set to become TVL”. ZIGChain is an L1 providing users with the required infrastructure for developers to build innovative wealth-generation protocols. Since October, the offering has witnessed an expression of interest from thousands of users, who have signed up for the testnet waitlist. Most recently, the first version of the ZIGChain Whitepaper was released to the public, revealing details of how the system’s governance structure, staking, and fees work as well as how the dev team plans on using its $ZIG reserves to fuel the ecosystem’s development Partnerships driving innovation and adoption Another area where ZIGChain has made significant strides recently is within the realm of strategic partnerships and innovative initiatives. For instance, the platform recently teamed up with Propchain to help meld blockchain tech with real estate investments — thus democratizing access to institutional-grade property investments and RWAs. To elaborate, Propchain brings a robust platform of $135 million in tokenized real estate and ZIGChain provides a purpose-driven L1 focused on wealth generation alongside a technical roadmap that includes the development of a dedicated interface to simplify complex financial transactions. Beyond real estate, ZIGChain has also entered the gaming sector by strategically integrating with Moon Tropica, a battle arena game. The collaboration seeks to enhance the latter’s in-game economy and elevate its general GameFi experiences. Furthermore, the project has also been actively sponsoring and participating in several global high-profile events, such as being the Gold Sponsor of CryptoFightWeek's CFN5 event in Dubai. Lastly, since the beginning of the year, ZIGChain has collaborated with numerous crypto entities including Web3Auth, HoudiniSwap, Enjinstarter, and SpectreAI. Not only that, to maximize user engagement, they've launched the innovative Wealth Generation Quest, offering 100 exclusive Wealth Passes that provide access to unique perks like private events, grants, airdrops, and giveaways across the ZIGChain ecosystem. Looking ahead toward an even brighter future? The growing anticipation around ZIGChain’s future seems to have not gone unnoticed by high-profile crypto investors, particularly notable whales who have been strategically accumulating $ZIG recently. For example, STILL K.A.P.O, a renowned trader with over 260,000 followers, publicly disclosed last month that he had been consistently purchasing 1 ETH worth of $ZIG daily for 30 days. Following suit, other prominent crypto personalities like Andrew Crypto, founder of CryptoAreaGlobal.com, and Stasher also announced similar token accumulation strategies, each committing to buying 1 ETH of $ZIG every day for approximately a month. Lastly, ZIGChain’s partnership with PureVPN , marked a significant milestone in ZIGChain's expansion, with the former serving as the first official validator for ZIGChain. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how the project continues to mature and grow in the near future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With its price already climbing from $0.03 to $0.15 during its presale stages, the token is positioned as a serious competitor. Some analysts predict it will surpass $15, landing among the top 20 tokens. The project's success lies in its innovative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, offering a mix of utility and accessibility that attracts both individual and institutional investors. Crypto Whales Purchased RXS Token The RXS Edge in Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance is transforming RWA tokenization by bridging blockchain technology with tangible assets like real estate, gold, and other commodities. This makes high-value markets accessible to everyone. An investor in Asia, for instance, can purchase fractional ownership of a premium apartment in Europe with just a few clicks, earning passive income. The platform's Token Builder simplifies this process, allowing users to tokenize their assets seamlessly. Combined with the Rexas Launchpad, individuals can raise funds by launching tokenized projects. These features eliminate traditional barriers to entry, such as geographic restrictions and high capital requirements, offering endless possibilities. The introduction of tools like the Rexas Quickmint Bot, GenAI, and AI Shield further enhances user experience, ensuring efficiency and security in tokenizing assets. These innovations demonstrate Rexas Finance's commitment to embedding every conceivable real-world asset into blockchain networks, delivering a revolutionary user-centric platform. RXS Presale Success and Community-Driven Growth Rexas Finance has experienced rapid presale success, with stages 1–9 selling out, raising $26,375,000. Now in stage 10, the token price has surged fivefold to $0.15. Early investors could enjoy up to a 1.33x increase in their holdings upon launch, amplifying interest in the project. RXS's tokenomics solidify its appeal. Of its 1 billion supply, allocations include 42.5% for the presale, 22.5% for staking pools, and 15% for liquidity. Marketing, team, and treasury allocations are optimized for sustainable growth. Rexas Finance's public presale strategy—opting not to rely on venture capital—ensures equitable access for retail investors. To further engage its growing community, Rexas Finance has launched a $1M giveaway, rewarding 20 lucky winners with $50,000 USDT each. This initiative not only promotes inclusivity but also demonstrates the project's focus on rewarding its early supporters. RXS holders gain multiple benefits, from staking rewards to governance privileges. Coupled with its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, the token has garnered credibility and visibility, driving investor confidence. Why Solana Bulls Are Watching While Solana's network efficiency remains unparalleled, analysts are now considering the potential of alternatives like RXS, which focus on utility and tangible outcomes. Unlike speculative tokens, Rexas Finance delivers real-world impact. As RXS prepares for public launch on three tier-1 exchanges, demand is set to soar. Analysts predict a $15 price point by early 2025, reflecting a 100x increase from current values. This growth potential positions RXS as an appealing option for long-term investors seeking significant returns. Conclusion Rexas Finance (RXS) is redefining crypto by integrating real-world asset tokenization with blockchain innovation. With its presale momentum, comprehensive utility, and an ambitious roadmap, RXS is poised to achieve top-20 status in the crypto market. The combination of tangible use cases, robust community support, and strategic tokenomics makes this token a prime contender in the market.

37925455,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52802,1734788789,BitBoy States One Reason Why RLUSD Is So Important for XRP,"Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value. They are typically pegged to traditional assets such as the U.S. dollar (USD). This stability contrasts with the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, enabling stablecoins to serve as reliable mediums of exchange, stores of value, and tools for efficient cross-border transactions. Cryptocurrency influencer Ben Armstrong, also known as Bitboy, recently highlighted this significance, describing stablecoins as “the backbone of this industry.” Armstrong emphasized that liquidity is crucial for the crypto ecosystem. Without adequate liquidity, markets cannot function efficiently—trading stalls, asset movement is hindered, and scaling becomes a challenge. Stablecoins like RLUSD help address these liquidity needs, particularly within the XRP ecosystem. #1 Reason why $RLUSD is so important for $XRP . Stablecoins are the backbone of this industry. Let me explain why. In crypto, liquidity is king. Without liquidity, you can’t trade, you can’t move assets, and you can’t scale markets. — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) December 19, 2024 The Importance of RLUSD for XRP Ripple’s introduction of RLUSD , a stablecoin fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents, marks a significant step for Ripple and the cryptocurrency industry. RLUSD is now available on global platforms such as Uphold, Bitso, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA, with plans for further expansion. This stablecoin directly impacts the XRP ecosystem . Following its launch, XRP’s price rose significantly, reflecting the market’s confidence in Ripple’s ability to innovate and improve liquidity. Stablecoins like RLUSD provide a stable medium of exchange, making transactions predictable and efficient, which is essential for scaling markets. By addressing liquidity concerns, RLUSD positions XRP to be more competitive in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Strategic Vision and Regulatory Alignment Ripple’s strategic vision for RLUSD goes beyond immediate market implications. The company aims to position RLUSD as a competitor to established stablecoins like Tether by emphasizing its backing with secure assets and seamless integration into Ripple’s existing infrastructure. This dual focus on reliability and utility is expected to drive adoption among users who prioritize stability in their digital transactions. Ripple’s commitment to regulatory compliance is underscored by its appointment of Kenneth Montgomery, the former First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, to the RLUSD advisory board. Montgomery’s expertise in regulatory and financial matters is expected to bolster Ripple’s efforts to align RLUSD with the broader financial system, further enhancing its appeal.

This new DeFi coin is the most talked-about project right now. It offers huge growth potential and utility. As such, it can easily outdo Solana (SOL) in this bull market. Experts also say that it will soon outperform Chainlink (LINK). With that in mind, they see the new DeFi coin as the most promising investment option in this bull market! SOL’s Price Recovers as Investors Buy the Dip Solana was recently swept up by a market-wide dip. Many altcoins recovered quickly, but Solana took its time. SOL’s price didn’t really move even when BTC went to a new ATH. This caused worry for Solana investors. However, SOL’s price is finally moving up now. Namely, right now, SOL’s price is valued at $222. This is a great level for Solana as it’s finally breaking out. Experts say that SOL’s price increase is largely driven by investors buying the dip. They also say that Solana will do well in the 2025 bull market. That’s because Solana has a growing investor base and a lot of utility to offer. As such, they see SOL’s price reaching over $300 in this bull market. However, there’s a new DeFi coin that will bring much larger profits than SOL. This new DeFi coin is also set to outperform Solana due to its native platform’s better transaction speeds. So, investors are focusing more on the new DeFi coin than SOL at the moment! Chainlink Has a New Partnership That Can Help LINK’s Price Grow LINK’s price is back below $30 at the moment. However, experts say that this isn’t concerning. Namely, Chainlink was also caught up in a market-wide dip. So, Chainlink’s price erased some of the increases it made before the dip started. But this is normal when the whole bull market dips. LINK’s price was quick to recover. This is a great sign for Chainlink. It shows that Chainlink is resilient despite a bearish pressure. It also shows that investors have confidence in LINK. These are all bullish factors for LINK. Also, Chainlink recently announced a new partnership. It teamed up with Hedera to bring better security and transparency to the DeFi coin market. Experts believe that this partnership will increase Chainlink’s market prominence. They say it will help boost LINK’s price in 2025. So, they expect LINK’s price to increase by at least 2x in this bull market. Even so, the new DeFi coin offers much more returns than this. So, it is a much more promising investment option than Chainlink! DTX Exchange: Bringing Great Utility and Perks for This Bull Market DTX Exchange (DTX) is coming at just the right time. As the bull market heats up, traders need a solid trading platform to maximize profits. And that’s exactly what DTX Exchange brings. Namely, it is a flexible trading platform that lets you trade over 100,000 crypto pairs. It also allows you to trade many other assets all from one place. Furthermore, you can trade with up to 1,000x leverage on DTX Exchange. This allows you to make massive profits with every trade. Also, you’ll have a much easier time managing assets. This is possible through DTX Exchange’s Phoenix Wallet. The wallet supports more than 10,000 assets and lets you manage them from one place. This will make trading much easier and faster for you. Also, DTX Exchange puts the “fair” in fair launches. Where most DeFi coin launches are backed by VCs and whales, DTX Exchange isn’t. It gives everyone an equal chance to join its current presale. Also, it has a great incremental price model. This allows its price to rise gradually throughout DTX’s lifecycle. So, no one will be able to dump the price over anyone’s head! DTX Exchange also offers unparalleled transaction speeds. Namely, you’ll get 100,000 TPS. This is much faster than Solana’s 600 TPS. With such transaction speeds, you’ll be able to get much better entries/exists on trades. This will help you make massive profits easily in this bull market! DTX: The Most Promising DeFi Coin You Can Buy! Right now, you can accumulate DTX while it's still in Stage 6 of its public presale. At this stage, DTX is selling for $0.12. This price will rise to $0.20 when DTX launches on multiple exchanges. So, early investors will already make over 66% gains on this new DeFi coin. However, experts say that DTX’s true price surge will come after the launch. They foresee DTX’s price rising by at least 50x in this bull market. Experts believe the rise will be fueled by DTX Exchange’s game-changing features and ease of use. Also, the bull market will help DTX rise even more and outdo many top altcoins!

Saylor’s “Digital Assets Framework” outlines strategies to foster the growth of the sector, establish compliance standards, and protect the rights of cryptocurrency holders and companies. According to Saylor, the implementation of these measures will increase economic prosperity, strengthen the global dominance of the US dollar, and help tackle national debt. In the proposal, Saylor highlighted the potential of digital assets to fuel a “capital markets renaissance,” unlocking trillions in wealth and empowering millions of businesses. “By establishing a clear taxonomy, a legitimate rights-based framework, and practical compliance obligations, the United States can lead the global digital economy,” Saylor wrote. Under Saylor’s leadership, MicroStrategy has become the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, with an estimated $42.6 billion worth of stock. Despite being known as a Bitcoin maximalist, Saylor’s framework includes proposals for regulating other digital assets, classifying them as commodities, securities or tokens based on their characteristics. Related News: Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Speaks: “The Fed Returned to a Hawkish Tone Today, But...” Saylor's taxonomy divides digital assets into different classes: Digital Commodities: Assets with no issuer and backed by digital power (e.g. Bitcoin). Digital Securities: Tokenized forms of equity or debt. Digital Currencies: Fiat-backed tokens. Digital Tokens: Unique categories such as NFTs and physical asset-backed tokens (e.g. gold or oil), as well as fungible tokens with a specific utility. The framework also introduces a “rights and responsibilities” model for issuers, exchanges and participants that emphasizes transparency, accountability and compliance with local laws. Saylor also advocates reducing the costs of issuing and storing digital assets. By limiting compliance expenses to 1% of a firm’s assets under management, Saylor claims the cost of issuing a token could drop from millions of dollars to as little as $10,000. One of the proposal’s core ideas, which has gained traction among crypto-friendly lawmakers like Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Trump, is the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. Saylor argues that such a reserve could generate between $16 trillion and $81 trillion in wealth and significantly ease the $36 trillion national debt. *This is not investment advice.

The proposal suggests that such a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve could generate between $16 and $81 trillion in wealth for the U.S. Treasury, potentially offering a path to offset the national debt. The proposal projects digital capital markets growth from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with U.S. investors capturing the majority stake. A strategic digital asset policy can strengthen the US dollar, neutralize the national debt, and position America as the global leader in the 21st-century digital economy—empowering millions of businesses, driving growth, and creating trillions in value. https://t.co/7n7jQqPkf1 — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 20, 2024 You might also like: This emerging DeFi token could steal the spotlight in 2025 The framework advocates for practical compliance measures. These include standardized disclosures and industry-led compliance protocols. At the same time, it aims to reduce issuance costs and expand market access to 40 million businesses from the current 4,000 public companies. MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq 100, replacing IT firm Super Micro Computer, is expected to trigger buying activity from index-tracking funds. The company’s success is seen by its market position, trading at approximately double the net asset value of its Bitcoin holdings. This premium allows MicroStrategy to continue issuing stock above its intrinsic value, allowing more Bitcoin purchases. The recent developments validate the Bitcoin-focused strategy championed by Saylor. Saylor has risen as one of the most prominent advocates for Bitcoin since starting the company’s cryptocurrency investments four years ago. According to the data from Saylortracker , the company holds 439,000 Bitcoin now, with an unrealized gain of $16 billion. MicroStrategy’s last BTC purchase was on Dec. 16, when the company purchased 15,350 coins for $1.5 billion. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has pushed the software company into the Nasdaq 100 index, with its market capitalization soaring to $88 billion despite holding Bitcoin worth approximately $43 billion. MicroStrategy has successfully raised nearly $20 billion from investors in 2024 through a combination of share sales and convertible bonds. The company’s stock has witnessed a surge of over 500% this year.

In his latest post, he went after the United States government spending and the Federal Reserve, while praising Bitcoin as usual. In his post, Kiyosaki warned the financial market like he has always done, but this time revealing new things. In his post on X, Kiyosaki shot straight to the point, saying he does not trust the United States government. He discussed the excess spending that the country has made under the last few administrations. Aside from the government, he also claims he does not trust the Federal Reserve and the United States Treasury. He hailed traders that currently hold silver and gold, noting that he is still at a loss on why people are still not adopting them. Robert Kiyosaki rips into the United States government According to his post on microblogging platform X, Robert Kiyosaki said his distrust for the United States government started in 1965 after he noticed that silver coins were becoming alloys of copper. In addition, he reminded his followers about the acts of President Nixon in 1971, taking the US dollar off the gold standard. “In 1971 President Nixon continued the theft of our wealth via our money when Tricky Ducky Nixon took the US dollar off the gold standard,” he said. THANK YOU gold, silver and Bitcoin HODLERS: I do not trust the US Giverment, the US Treasury, or the FED. If you trust these Den of Thieves that is your choice. I stopped trusting my government in 1965, when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of cooper. In 1971… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 21, 2024 Kiyosaki revealed that it was during that period that he decided to start saving gold and silver before adding Bitcoin. He noted that the best assets that people need to save are real gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He said that way, their wealth will not be stolen through the fake money in the system. Kiyosaki said it has always been the same way, highlighting what people do with the dollars. “Keep being ignorant, working hard for fake money, and continue listening to financial planners who will tell you what to do with your fake money,” he said. Kiyosaki issues crucial warning, makes new Bitcoin prediction In typical fashion, Kiyosaki also signaled clear warnings to the general public, noting that things are about to crash. He noted that the imminent crash could be the biggest ever, using a similar tone as his previous warnings. As always, he also believes that only Bitcoin, silver, and gold can save people in the financial market. This present warning is in line with a long list of warnings that the Rich Dad Poor Dad author has sounded over the last few years. He claims to believe that Bitcoin, an asset that he has been championing can save the entire planet. It remains relatively unknown if this “big market crash” is going to come anytime soon. It is also unknown if it is a scare tactic to push people into adopting Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Kiyosaki still thinks Bitcoin could hit as high as $350,000 very soon. In his statement, Kiyosaki credited Trump’s influence while noting that his support for the asset could spell good things for the industry. With Trump eyeing a national Bitcoin reserve, there is optimism that favorable laws, something that the market has been lacking, would be created for the sector. Kiyosaki has advised the market to start buying bits of the asset. Bitcoin is presently trading at $99,160 after the asset dropped from $108,000 to around $92,000 on Tuesday. The 15% drop came after the Federal Reserve announced rate cuts next year, revealing plans to reduce its dovish policy.

The momentum was short-lived, as SUI experienced a significant retracement on Friday, plummeting nearly 30% to $3.49. However, the token rebounded swiftly, stabilizing at approximately $4.55, representing a 12.8% increase from the week’s low and just 8.9% shy of its record price, SUI Surges Amid Market Volatility In stark contrast, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have continued to experience downward corrections following the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed)0 recent decision regarding interest rates. The Fed’s dovish stance has negatively impacted risk assets, contributing to a generally bearish sentiment in the market that led the market’s leading crypto, to retrace almost 10% from the record high of $108,000. The volatility surrounding SUI led to nearly $14 million in liquidations across both long and short positions on centralized exchanges, with Binance reporting the highest liquidation rates within the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinalyze. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Loses Momentum: Could A Drop To $75,000 Signal The Final Correction? Notably, recent analysis has indicated that Sui ranks third in net inflows over the past three months, with close to $1 billion entering the network, highlighting the growing investor interest in SUI, further bolstered by a new partnership with Phantom wallet. Crypto analyst Route 2 FI noted in a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), that the bullish reversal in SUI’s price indicated strong investor sentiment, culminating in the token’s record peak at the beginning of the week. Analyst Targets $6 As Market Momentum Builds Michael van de Poppe, another respected analyst, pointed out the substantial daily candle movement in SUI, emphasizing that the price dipped into support before quickly bouncing back. He expressed optimism that this trend is far from over, suggesting that SUI could continue its upward trajectory with a target of $6 in sight. The recent surge in SUI’s price is also expected to attract Bitcoin liquidity into its ecosystem, further enhancing the token’s bullish prospects. Technical analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that SUI has effectively executed a post-breakout retest from its re-accumulation range. Rekt also noted that strategic partnerships with Babylon Labs and Lombard Finance would facilitate the integration of Bitcoin liquidity, which could significantly benefit the Sui platform. Related Reading: XRP, Solana Among Altcoins Witnessing TD Buy Signal, Analyst Reveals The growing interest in SUI raises questions about its potential performance in 2025.

The researcher contends that the Sui Network has started to captivate institutional investors, a trend attributed to its dominant technology, upcoming integrations with Phantom and Backpack, and a talented core and executive team. This is expected to continue throughout the current bullish cycle and into 2025, adding to the bullish sentiment for the altcoin as the year draws to a close.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

The updated policy, which comes into effect on January 15, 2025, is part of Google’s broader effort to align with local regulations and promote responsible advertising practices in the crypto space. The tech giant stated that it will only permit FCA-registered advertisers to promote crypto exchange services and software wallets in the UK. Additionally, advertisements for hardware wallets, which store private keys for cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), will also be allowed but with restrictions. These devices must not offer additional services such as buying, selling, or trading digital assets. Local Compliance Takes Center Stage Google stated the importance of adhering to local laws, reminding advertisers to comply with the financial regulations of jurisdictions where their ads will appear. “This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these financial products,” the company clarified. The move reflects a growing trend among regulators worldwide to address concerns over crypto-related advertising. By enforcing stricter requirements, Google aims to mitigate the risks associated with misleading or unregulated promotions. The FCA has been actively monitoring unauthorized crypto promotions in the UK. On December 16, it issued a warning about a Solana-based memecoin and NFT project called “Retardio,” flagging the firm’s lack of registration. The FCA cautioned consumers that engaging with unregistered entities could leave them vulnerable to financial losses, especially if such companies go out of business. Global Crackdown on Crypto Advertising The UK is not alone in tightening oversight of crypto promotions . Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently introduced its own measures, requiring virtual asset service providers and influencers to obtain approval before marketing crypto products. This global regulatory shift highlights the increasing scrutiny faced by the digital asset industry as authorities work to safeguard consumers. Google’s new policy serves as a critical reminder for advertisers to stay ahead of compliance requirements. As the January 2025 deadline approaches, crypto firms targeting UK audiences will need to ensure their operations meet FCA standards.

37923697,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631526,1734786918,Trump might not be able to fire Powell but he can remove everyone else at the Fed,"We’ve all got it by now that President Donald Trump can’t fire Federal Reserve Jerome Powell. But the rest of the board? They’re fair game. And he knows it. So do they, which is why some are reportedly already looking for help to keep their jobs. The Federal Reserve Board is made up of seven members, each appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. With many Biden appointees in key positions right now, Trump might see it fit to clean house. Who’s sitting on the chopping block? First, let’s talk about Powell. Trump appointed him back in 2017, and his term as Chair doesn’t expire until 2026. Legally, Powell can’t be removed unless the president-elect finds a reason that meets the “for cause” standard. That means gross misconduct, not policy disagreements. Powell knows this. He’s defiant, and oddly very powerful. When asked if he’d resign if Trump asked, Powell replied with one word: “No.” He then allowed a few seconds to pass so everyone could take his response in. But Trump isn’t focused on Powell yet. He’s got a smaller fish to fry, starting with Michael Barr, the Vice Chair for Supervision. Barr’s job is to oversee bank regulation, and he’s a Biden guy. His term runs until 2026, but Trump’s advisers are already exploring ways to get rid of him. The argument? Barr’s role isn’t tied directly to monetary policy, so it might not carry the same protections as Powell’s job. Barr, clearly aware of the incoming storm, has lawyered up. He’s seeking advice from Arnold & Porter, a heavyweight law firm, in case Trump does pull the rug out from under him. Next, there’s Adriana Kugler. She’s another Biden appointee, and her term ends in January 2026. Trump doesn’t even have to get creative here — Adriana has a terrible reputation. Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook, both appointed by Biden in 2022, are also in danger of losing their jobs. Trump’s allies on the board are safe though. Christopher Waller, who joined in 2020, and Michelle Bowman, appointed in 2018, are Trump picks. Waller focuses on monetary policy, and Bowman is all about community banking. These two aren’t going anywhere unless Trump wants them gone—and why would he? The legal loopholes Trump might exploit Here’s where it gets tricky. Federal law says a Fed governor can only be removed “for cause.” That sounds airtight, but the definition of “cause” isn’t crystal clear. Misconduct? Sure. Policy disagreements? Probably not. But Trump, being who he is, could test this in court. Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former Vice Chair of the Fed, weighed in. He thinks the courts would likely side with Powell, but he’s not making any guarantees. “Trump could try and he might try,” Blinder said. If it goes to the Supreme Court, all bets are off. There’s also the option of demotion. Trump could leave Powell on the board but strip him of the Chair position. It’s never been done before, so there’s no precedent, but legal experts agree it’s a gray area. And if Trump doesn’t want to deal with the courts, he could go straight to the Republican-majority Congress. The Federal Reserve Act isn’t carved in stone. Congress can amend it, and Trump could lobby for changes that weaken the Fed’s independence. The president’s allies are already rallying behind him. Senator Mike Lee posted on X (formerly Twitter), “The Executive Branch should be under the direction of the president. Yet another reason why we should #EndTheFed.” Elon Musk, the guy the president calls “America’s First Buddy,” chimed in with a not-so-subtle emoji to Lee’s post. The Federal Reserve’s independence has always been a sensitive issue. It wasn’t until the 1950s that the Fed became truly independent, breaking away from the Treasury Department’s influence. Since then, presidents have largely respected the Fed’s autonomy. Trump, however, is not like most presidents. Attempts to remove Fed officials are rare, but they’re not unheard of. During Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, a case involving the dismissal of an FTC commissioner set a precedent for protecting agency independence. Legal experts believe this case could be cited if Trump tries to oust Powell or any other board member. Why does this matter? Because the Fed’s decisions affect everyone. It has far-reaching effects for global economies and financial markets. Wall Street is already nervous. Any move to undermine the Fed’s independence could spook our markets, just as it did during Trump’s first term. Or a few days ago after Powell said his Fed wants nothing to do with Bitcoin ever, and it crashed by 8% in mere hours. Nothing is safe.

The duo has risen as standout performers following Bitcoin’s rise to $108,000. According to data from Hedge Fund Research, cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds achieved gains of 46% in November, pushing their year-to-date returns to 76%. This performance outpaces the broader hedge fund industry, which recorded a more modest 10% gain in the first 11 months of 2024.

Under billionaire Mike Novogratz’s leadership, Galaxy Digital has posted even more impressive results. Its hedge fund strategy has delivered a 43% return in November and a 90% gain in 2024. The New York-based firm has successfully expanded its assets under management to $4.8 billion. This was partly through strategic acquisitions of assets from distressed crypto companies. The recent rally gained additional momentum following Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory. Investors view this as a potential catalyst for more crypto-friendly regulatory policies. Trump’s appointment of venture capitalist David Sacks as cryptocurrency czar and the anticipated replacement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler with cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins has further helped market confidence. Still, it was under Gensler that the crypto sector received a major boost in January 2024 when the SEC approved 11 exchange-traded Bitcoin ( BTC ) funds. This move opened new channels for institutional and retail investment. However, the market experienced a slight pullback this week following the Federal Reserve’s announcement of lower-than-expected rate cuts for the coming year.

With Bitcoin ETFs debuting, a crypto-friendly U.S. president-elect, and the market cap doubling, 2024 has set the stage for unprecedented growth. Here are five key trends shaping the year, backed by data from @intotheblock: 1. Bitcoin’s Dominance Reigns Supreme The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January bridged the gap between crypto and traditional finance. Bitcoin’s market dominance surged from under 50% to 59%, a three-year high. Institutional investments poured in, exceeding $10 billion. Speculation about a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve further propelled its ascent. 2. Memecoin Explosion Memecoins experienced a massive surge, with their combined market cap growing by 400% and adding $100 billion in value. Dogecoin flourished, buoyed by Elon Musk’s initiatives, while Pepe skyrocketed by 1,200%, reaching a $7 billion valuation. Solana’s Pumpfun launchpad alone generated $300 million in revenue. 3. Ethereum Faces an Identity Crisis Lower transaction fees reduced ETH burning, causing a year-end increase in supply. Although Layer 2 solutions improved scalability, they weakened Ethereum’s “ultra-sound money” narrative. Meanwhile, activity shifted to emerging networks like Solana and Base, prompting Ethereum to reconsider its priorities for 2025. 4. DeFi Makes a Comeback Decentralized finance (DeFi) saw a renaissance as total value locked (TVL) returned to $150 billion, matching 2021 highs. Losses from hacks hit a four-year low, restoring trust in the sector. New protocols and enhanced regulations drew significant capital back on-chain. 5. Innovations Reshape the Landscape Restaking protocols attracted over $25 billion, enabling higher yields on existing networks. Stablecoins like Ethena democratized funding rate arbitrage. These advancements introduced sustainable earning opportunities, redefining the crypto space. 2024 has been the year crypto went mainstream Bitcoin ETFs, a US president-elect backing crypto, and a market cap doubling.

37923243,https://crypto.news/?p=14321160,1734786120,"As Bitcoin soars, major brands will find crypto more palatable | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. The price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) rises and falls. It always has and likely always will—just as any stock or asset does. However, as of late, its jumps are far larger than its drops. In other words, crypto enthusiasts are enjoying their own version of the Roaring Twenties , an era of Western economic prosperity following the devastating Great War. You might also like: Launchpads are the key to decoding crypto’s investment complexity | Opinion Likewise, Bitcoin holders and crypto advocates are gleefully checking their digital wallets and watching token values take off just two years after the start of a down market. While crypto bros and decentralized maximalists toast to their chubbier portfolios, the elephant in the room is incoming US President Donald Trump . Trump’s upcoming second term in the White House could reshape the crypto landscape, but much like rising token prices, this remains purely speculative. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that Trump’s total embrace of digital assets provides plenty of upside for the industry. Some have pointed to a Trump quote from July stating that he would establish a “strategic national Bitcoin reserve” as a hint that Bitcoin as legal tender could be on the table. This is also just speculation, but it sure does fuel an industry that has been gaining momentum over the past year. Realistically, achieving the ultimate objective of mainstream adoption isn’t likely in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s inauguration—or even in the first year of his term. However, the industry’s sky-high optimism, along with tangible progress in notable areas such as real-world asset tokenization, spot Bitcoin ETFs , and burgeoning AI-powered use case, provide it with stronger roots. While technological advancements are wonderful (and needed), the path to mainstream adoption won’t be paved by a revolutionary autonomous liquid restaking platform. Instead, mainstream adoption will be achieved through meaningful association with name brands outside the financial and tech sectors. Sure, big-name brands like Nike, Starbucks, Louis Vuitton, and others may have embraced NFTs following their unprecedented success in 2021. However, jumping on a hype bandwagon that ultimately went south isn’t exactly a meaningful initiative. Thanks to the industry’s renewed success and Bitcoin’s gains, several big brands have announced plans to accept crypto payments. Two weeks ago, French department store Printemps announced it was working with Binance and French fintech firm Lyzi to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ) across all its stores in France. Earlier this month, luxury cruiseliner Virgin Voyages began accepting Bitcoin payments, while luxury goods producer S.T. Dupont said it would start accepting crypto payments in two Paris stores by Christmas. While this may be a PR stunt to come off as innovative and could even be a strategic business decision by some slumping luxury brands, it nevertheless pushes crypto into the mainstream. In addition to brick-and-mortar shops accepting crypto payments, fintech solutions like PayPal and WooCommerce are increasingly enabling online shoppers and merchants to integrate and make payments using digital assets. These payment gateways help close the gaps between crypto and the broader economic landscape. GT Protocol aims to achieve this exact goal by building AI agents capable of smoothly integrating into both crypto and non-crypto services. The AI executive technology platform has integrated its AI agents with major global brands, including Amazon, Shein, Nike, and more. As a project demonstrating the power of AI and crypto through its blockchain execution technology, GT Protocol sees the convergence of AI agents, crypto, and e-commerce as a way for its platform to onboard more users towards web4. There are many paths to onboarding new users, but collaborating or integrating crypto payment rails with mainstream brands seems like a shortcut. If crypto can maintain its momentum and continue innovating in the upcoming year, expect to see more brands across many key industries look for ways to bridge crypto and retail.

This marks the lowest level of returns since the bull rally began on October 10th. The data suggests that many traders bought during the peak of market euphoria, leaving their positions underwater as the price corrected. Historically, Bitcoin’s 30-day MVRV averages around 0% due to the zero-sum nature of markets. Negative MVRV readings can signal potential buying opportunities, as they indicate a majority of recent traders are at a loss.

Losing momentum last week, it broke down to a month low and recovered with 8% gains in the last 24 hours. Following the November rally, which came without any major retracement, Dogecoin later faced resistance and formed a double-top pattern under the $0.5 level earlier this month. The bearish pattern led to a sudden fall last week before collapsing heavily into the $0.2 range this week. The $0.26 level provided support yesterday and the price recovered well with a strong daily close above the $0.3 level on the hourly chart. Today, volatility enhanced and the price increased to where it trades at $0.345. Doge’s recovery is currently reaching the $0.36 level that broke down as support in the mid-week. A rejection may occur when the price retests this mentioned level. This could trigger another reduction in the market. But if the price increases above the mentioned level, the leading meme coin may break out to a new high in no time. Looking at yesterday’s interception from the bulls’ side, we may see a bigger recovery in the upcoming week if they continue to show commitment daily.

Deaton quoted the video, saying it is why Elon Musk-led D.O.G.E. is “necessary.” Stewart highlighted the disconnect between the Pentagon’s budget and the realities faced by service members. “ We got out of 20 years of war, and the Pentagon got a raise ,” Stewart remarked. “I can’t figure out how $850 billion to a department means that the rank and file still have to be on food stamps. To me, that’s f*cking corruption. ” Dragonchain attorney and pro-crypto Republican John Deaton quoted a TikTok video that included an interview on his X account, saying, “If you think Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s D.O.G.E isn’t necessary, watch this.” Deaton, who also supports XRP, seemingly suggested that the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) could bring much-needed accountability to departments like the Pentagon. Legal tensions in the US SEC’s crypto cases Deaton’s criticism extended to the ongoing legal conflict between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various crypto firms, including the case against Dragonchain. The SEC has accused Dragonchain of unregistered crypto asset security offerings, just like it had done to Ripple Labs and its token XRP. In a recent court filing related to the SEC’s case, Deaton lashed out at the agency’s aggressive tactics, claiming that certain SEC lawyers continue to bully American entrepreneurs, especially those in the crypto sector. “ Certain lawyers at the SEC are continuing their bully tactics in non-fraud crypto cases against American entrepreneurs ,” Deaton said on X. He added that Dragonchain, which originated from Disney, is “as American as it gets.” Certain lawyers at the @SECGov are continuing their bullying tactics in non-fraud crypto cases against American entrepreneurs. @dragonchain originated out of Disney. You don’t get more American than that. @GaryGensler and his cronies won’t do what’s right, so we fight. https://t.co/LsOT5E8WXj — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 21, 2024 The court filing also raised concerns about the SEC’s current approach to litigation, citing upcoming changes in leadership that could affect the agency’s strategy. “ There are fast-approaching changes to SEC leadership and enforcement priorities ,” the filing read. “ This case meets those criteria, ” referencing an expected shift away from litigation that does not involve investor fraud or imminent harm. Shifting SEC leadership As Deaton and other legal experts continue to challenge the SEC’s enforcement strategies, the agency itself is undergoing a period of transition. The departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has been heavily involved in crypto-related enforcement, has sparked speculation about the future direction of the agency. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by aggressive actions against cryptocurrency firms, including high-profile lawsuits against Ripple, Coinbase, and Binance. John Reed Stark, former chief of the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, criticized Gensler’s approach, suggesting that the financial authority’s leadership has become too entrenched in aggressive enforcement tactics. Stark noted the promotion of several senior enforcement officers who have been at the forefront of the agency’s crypto crackdown. “ SEC Chair Gary Gensler is clearly attempting to pilot the SEC Enforcement Division from the grave, ” Stark remarked. “ Since Donald Trump’s election, Gensler has promoted five Senior Officers within the SEC Enforcement Division at SEC Headquarters. Four of these SEC enforcement staff cut their teeth as SEC crypto-enforcement superstars .” Stark speculated that the incoming leadership, expected to follow a pro-crypto agenda, could bring about significant changes in the way the agency handles crypto enforcement cases. However, he warned that seasoned enforcement staff might face challenges in adapting to new policies. However, the incoming pro-crypto agenda under the regulator’s chair nominee Paul Atkins may signal a shift in how the agency handles such cases moving forward. Under this new leadership, the SEC could change its approach to enforcement, particularly in cases involving companies like Ripple, Coinbase, and others embroiled in similar legal battles.

It is trading at resistance and is now on the verge of breaking out. As several altcoins witnessed major losses in the past few days, SUI saw a little drop and quickly recovered after testing the descending trendline, which has been providing support for the market since August. On the daily chart, the bulls appeared back in control and now look set to cross over the $4.9 resistance level that initiated drops this week. A successful cross-over there should fuel bigger growth in the upcoming week. Rejecting this resistance could slow down things for the bulls. However, it is important to note that the overall market structure is still looking bullish from a mid-term perspective as SUI maintained a higher high and higher low pattern on the daily chart. The steady rise in the daily volume indicator is another factor to consider for more growth. While the bears continue to suffer loss daily, a dip below the ascending trendline could trigger a serious sell-off capable of activating a major retracement in the market. This should give the bears temporal control before rising back. But for now, SUI’s bears are looking for more gains! SUI Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview SUI is currently on the verge of breaking out of the weekly $4.9 high. In anticipation, the next key level to watch for a surge is $6, $8 and $10. If by any chance the price slips back to yesterday’s low with a break below the white support trendline, the immediate support level to watch would be $2.973, followed by the $2.37 level.

Highlighted in a tweet by Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X), these movements reflect growing confidence among major investors. : Massive #XRP Transaction: 30,000,000 XRP Transferred from UPbit to Unknown Wallet Whale activity rising again pic.twitter.com/JaFErhkCK1 — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) December 21, 2024 Another major transfer of 99,999,977 XRP ($222M) between two wallets further underscores strategic repositioning by key holders. Analysts predict these actions could precede a breakout, positioning XRP for a potential rally to $3. Ripple’s Legal Battles Stir Market Anticipation Ripple’s high-stakes legal proceedings, including pivotal appeal briefings involving CEO Brad Garlinghouse, continue to draw significant attention to XRP. Market analysts believe a favorable outcome could serve as a game-changer, acting as a major catalyst to elevate market sentiment and push XRP beyond key psychological thresholds. This legal optimism is further bolstered by an uptick in whale activity, reflecting long-term confidence among major holders. XRP’s price has been consolidating between $2.00 and $2.90, a range that analysts describe as a “pressure zone” for a potential breakout. The convergence of whale accumulation and Ripple’s legal momentum has positioned XRP at the crossroads of institutional and retail interest, with higher resistance levels now in its sights. XRP Technical Outlook – December 21, 2024 XRP is currently trading at $2.30, marking a 16% increase in the past 24 hours. This surge is supported by robust market activity, as reflected in the $21.36 billion 24-hour trading volume. However, XRP faces a significant resistance zone at $2.38, where a downward trendline intersects with prior support, now acting as a supply zone. XRP Technical Outlook – Dec 21, 2024 XRP surges 16% to $2.30 with $21.36B volume, but resistance at $2.38 looms. RSI at 58 signals neutral momentum. Breakout targets $2.45+. Will it rally or retest $2.22 support? #XRP #CryptoUpdate pic.twitter.com/VpzyCiE5cE — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) December 21, 2024 Key technical indicators suggest mixed signals. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), positioned just below the current price, reinforces tentative recovery momentum, but the emergence of a Doji candle and a bearish engulfing pattern signal potential selling pressure near $2.38. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58, indicating neutral momentum with a slight bullish inclination. A decisive breakout above $2.38 could trigger bullish momentum, targeting $2.45 and beyond. However, failure to breach this resistance could result in a retest of lower support levels, such as $2.22. $STARS Presale Raises Over $25M – Trading Starts Soon!

37922614,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631498,1734784481,Canada’s retaliation to Trump’s tariffs and takeover threats could be lethal,"The tension between Canada and the United States has hit a boiling point. President Donald Trump is back on his favorite stage (Twitter) throwing out threats of a 25% tariff on Canadian goods and even ridiculously suggesting that Canada should become the “51st state.” In response, Canada is preparing to strike back hard. Its retaliation could be devastating for the US economy, leaving the world’s largest trading partnership in ruins. Trudeau takes the first swing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew down to Mar-a-Lago in late November to confront Trump face-to-face. In a tense three-hour meeting, he reportedly tried to steer the conversation toward diplomacy and mutual benefit. But let’s be real—convincing Trump to back down on a tariff he thinks will “fix” immigration and drug trafficking is like trying to stop a freight train with a bicycle. After the meeting, Trump almost immediately doubled down on his tariff threats and threw gasoline on the fire by casually floating the idea that Canada could become part of the US. His exact words? “Maybe Canada should think about becoming the 51st state. They’d love it.” Canadians, predictably, did not love it. Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre fired back almost immediately. “Canada will never be the 51st state,” he said in a press conference. “We are a sovereign nation, and we will not be bullied.” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said, “Our country’s independence is non-negotiable.” The backlash wasn’t limited to political circles. Across Canada, citizens took to social media to mock Trump’s suggestion. One viral tweet read, “We’d rather join Mars than the US #51stStateNever.” Even provinces that often disagree on policy seemed to find common ground in rejecting the notion of statehood. If Trump thought his statehood comment would pressure Canada into submission, he miscalculated—big time. The idea of becoming a US state is about as popular in Canada as pineapple on poutine. For many Canadians, the suggestion is an insult to their national identity. Canada’s universal healthcare, progressive social policies, and cultural distinctiveness are sources of pride. Losing those in exchange for being lumped into a system they see as chaotic and unequal? Hard pass. A 2023 survey found that 44% of Canadians already feel uneasy about high immigration levels, fearing it could dilute Canadian identity. Throwing in statehood, with all the political baggage that comes with it, is a non-starter for most. That said, not everyone is slamming the door on closer ties with the US. Some Canadians see benefits in increased cooperation, particularly in areas like defense and border security. A handful of people even argue that aligning more closely with the US could offer economic stability in the long term. But let’s be clear: “closer ties” is not the same as becoming the 51st state. A $500 billion punch in the gut Economically, Trump’s tariff proposal is a sledgehammer aimed at Canada’s biggest industries. With $3.6 billion CAD worth of goods crossing the border daily, a 25% tariff could cripple sectors like manufacturing, agriculture, and energy. Canada is the largest foreign supplier of oil and natural gas to the US, making energy exports one of its most powerful bargaining chips. Officials are reportedly preparing a menu of retaliatory measures that could make Trump regret he ever hit “Tweet.” First on the list: targeted tariffs on US goods. The plan? Go straight for the economic jugular by focusing on states that rely heavily on Canadian trade. If these tariffs hit hard enough, they could push American lawmakers to pressure Trump into backing off. Energy export taxes are also on the table. If Canada slaps a tax on its oil and natural gas heading to the US, energy prices could skyrocket south of the border.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-will-skyrocket-19000-before-first-exchange-listing-as-pepe-and-wif-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Among these, Qubetics has recently caught the eye of many investors with its growing ecosystem and innovative services. But what’s even more intriguing is its potential for growth after the mainnet launch—analysts are predicting significant gains, possibly hitting $10-$15. Is Qubetics really the best altcoin to join now? Along with other promising altcoins like Cosmos and Polygon, there’s a lot happening in the crypto space in 2024, and this article will break it all down for you. While many projects are pushing for advancements in scalability, security, and decentralisation, Qubetics takes a more user-centric approach. One of its standout features is its non-custodial wallet, a tool that aims to address critical issues that have plagued the crypto space for years. These issues include security risks, privacy concerns, and the overwhelming reliance on third parties for managing digital assets. But what makes Qubetics’ solution different? We’ll dive deeper into how this wallet could be a game-changer for the industry and why it’s one of the best altcoins to join now , particularly as it heads towards its mainnet launch. Why Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Wallet Is Changing the Game If you’re in the crypto space, you’ve likely encountered issues with traditional custodial wallets. These wallets, often controlled by third parties, introduce a variety of risks. From security breaches to regulatory concerns, the problems are plenty. The lack of true control over your assets is a big deal, especially when your financial future is on the line. Many investors are looking for an alternative that offers security, privacy, and full control—Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet does just that. Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet allows users to manage their digital assets without depending on a third party. This means your private keys are yours and yours alone, giving you the ability to access your funds at any time. It reduces the risk of security breaches—something that’s unfortunately all too common in the crypto world. The wallet is designed to give users total control, removing the usual roadblocks that other wallets may impose. This is a huge plus for anyone serious about their crypto assets. Moreover, regulatory issues have been a constant headache for the crypto community. With governments around the world tightening regulations, having a non-custodial wallet gives users the peace of mind that their funds are not subject to sudden legal shifts. There’s no dependency on centralised institutions, which means your financial freedom is protected from unforeseen regulatory changes. As we move into 2024, these benefits are making Qubetics one of the best altcoins to join now. Additionally, privacy is a concern for many in the crypto world. Centralised exchanges and custodial wallets require you to trust third parties with sensitive information. In contrast, Qubetics’ wallet ensures that all transactions are private, and personal data remains under the user’s control. This privacy-first approach is not only timely but also crucial for anyone wanting to maintain anonymity in an increasingly transparent world. To learn more about Qubetics, you can check this out: Watch the Video . Why Cosmos is Worth Watching in 2024 When you think about blockchain ecosystems, Cosmos should be at the top of your list. Cosmos has long been touted as one of the best altcoins to join now due to its groundbreaking approach to interoperability. The project’s primary goal is to allow different blockchains to communicate and work together seamlessly, something that traditional blockchain systems struggle with. As the demand for multi-chain applications continues to grow, Cosmos is becoming more and more essential in the crypto ecosystem. The network allows developers to build custom blockchains that can interact with each other, making it a hub for decentralised finance (DeFi) and beyond. Cosmos is on the cutting edge of creating a more connected blockchain ecosystem, making it an exciting project to follow, especially with its recent updates and integrations. In 2024, the roadmap for Cosmos looks promising, with new developments around the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol that allows different blockchains to transfer assets and data securely and efficiently. As blockchain ecosystems continue to grow, Cosmos’ role in enabling interoperability will only become more important, making it one of the top altcoins to invest in for the future. With its unique approach and solid foundations, Cosmos is a smart long-term investment for anyone looking to expand their crypto portfolio. The Rise of Polygon and Its Impact on Ethereum’s Future Polygon is another powerhouse that has gained traction as one of the best altcoins to join now. While Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, the rise of scalability challenges has sparked the need for more efficient solutions. Polygon, with its Layer-2 scaling solutions, offers a fast and cost-effective way to process transactions on the Ethereum network. In 2024, Polygon is poised to continue growing as Ethereum’s go-to scaling solution. The network allows developers to build decentralised applications (dApps) that operate faster and with lower fees, making it an attractive choice for developers and users alike. As the DeFi and NFT sectors continue to boom, Polygon’s role in providing scalability will only become more critical. Furthermore, Polygon’s recent integrations and partnerships highlight its increasing relevance in the crypto world. As blockchain adoption continues to expand, the scalability that Polygon offers will help meet the demands of high-traffic applications and transactions, ensuring that the Ethereum ecosystem remains competitive. With Polygon continuing to lead the charge in Ethereum scalability, it’s no wonder that many investors see it as one of the best altcoins to invest in for short-term gains. The Key Takeaway When it comes to the best altcoins to join now , Qubetics, Cosmos, and Polygon are all strong contenders. However, what sets Qubetics apart is its focus on user control and privacy, specifically through its non-custodial wallet. As the crypto world faces growing concerns around security, regulation, and privacy, Qubetics’ solution could be a game-changer. With analysts predicting significant growth for $TICS, Qubetics is an exciting opportunity for anyone looking to get in early. While Cosmos and Polygon offer unique strengths, such as interoperability and Ethereum scalability, Qubetics is tapping into a growing demand for privacy-first, user-controlled financial solutions. As we move forward into 2024, keep an eye on Qubetics—this could be one of the best altcoins to invest in for short-term and long-term gains.

Known for its scalability and interoperability, Polkadot aims to connect different blockchains into a unified network. And the market seems to believe in its vision. Analysts are already predicting a potential rebound to $50, a significant leap from its current trading range. The secret to Polkadot’s success lies in its unique architecture. By enabling multiple blockchains to work together, it’s solving one of crypto’s biggest pain points: fragmentation. This capability isn’t just theoretical; it’s actively attracting projects that value cross-chain collaboration. With its strong fundamentals and an ambitious goal to redefine blockchain interoperability, Polkadot is more than just a “safe bet.” It’s a project with the potential for exponential growth, making it one of the best altcoins with 1000X potential.

37922327,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666120,1734784201,"Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $178,000 If History Repeats — Here’s Why","The price of Bitcoin fell to around $92,000, Friday afternoon, December 20 after the US Federal Reserve’s rate cut triggered a sharp selloff in the crypto market. However, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be recovering nicely, having returned above the $97,000 level on the same day. While investors would be hoping to see the Bitcoin price reclaim its current all-time high of $108,135 again, a prominent crypto analyst has put forward an audacious target for the market leader. Below is the rationale behind the new bullish target for the Bitcoin price. Can Bitcoin Price Repeat This 86% Rally? In a new post on the X platform, NewsBTC head of research Tony “The Bull” Severino shared an interesting prognosis for the price of Bitcoin. According to the CMT-certified crypto analyst, the flagship cryptocurrency looks primed to reach as high as $178,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Still Mirroring Bullish Move From 2023, What To Expect After Hitting $108,000 ATH This bullish projection is based on the Bitcoin price movement in relation to the Bollinger Bands. The Bollinger Bands is an indicator that features three lines; a simple moving average (the middle band) and an upper and lower band. This technical analysis tool helps to assess the volatility of financial markets. According to Severino, the price of BTC on the daily timeframe has retested the monthly upper Bollinger Band. From a historical perspective, this action has marked the start of significant price rallies in the past. Most recently, a similar retest occurred in late January 2024 and was followed by an 86% price rally to the former all-time high of $73,737. Severino noted that if history repeats itself the Bitcoin price could also see an identical 86% rally from its current price point to reach a new record high of $178,000. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $97,265, reflecting a 0.8% increase in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the premier cryptocurrency is still in a 4% decline on the weekly timeframe. Here’s What Needs To Happen First Indeed, the $178,000 target might not be all that outrageous for the Bitcoin price, especially given its performance in recent months. However, the latest on-chain data shows that the market leader needs to overcome a major resistance around $97,500 and $99,800. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Could Push Price To $500,000: Expert According to crypto pundit Ali Martinez on X, over 924,000 addresses bought over 1.19 million BTC within the aforementioned price bracket. This becomes a resistance as buyers within the price range might look to sell their assets to break even after being in loss; this puts downward pressure on prices. Martinez, however, noted that if the price of BTC manages to successfully breach this level, investors might see the premier cryptocurrency return to its all-time high price and perhaps forge a new one.

New year, new bull run, and a new narrative in the form of AI meme coins are tearing up the cryptosphere right now. With $5.7m raised, and investors seeing 54,991% from its presale alone, iDEGEN is flexing hard . And it’s ready to give all the square meme coin doubters the middle finger when it lists on DEX in early January. iDEGEN may just be the maddest thing this sector has seen in 2024. And for crypto, that’s saying something. iDEGEN: The wildest crypto experiment ever? Anyone who thought crypto couldn’t get any weirder is about to get the wind knocked out of them. iDEGEN is an AI agent unleashed and insane on X. Posting hourly, and responding to everything, nobody, not even the people who built the thing, knows what it will say. Everything it spits out, it has learned from its community. Like a dark, twisted, AI infant, raised exclusively on Crypto Twitter. There’s zero censorship imposed on iDEGEN; no woke mandate from some techno elite. So far, it’s produced the kind of unhinged takes every degen lusts after. And the engagement has been impressive as a result. Of course, this isn’t just for lolz. Like the AI meme coin greats that iDEGEN is joining, automated AI social activity is some serious meme coin magic. 24/7 interaction with its community and exponentially more posting than whatever some 9-5 social media manager can handle generates the kind of attention all meme coins would kill for. AI meme coins look like they’ll be 2025’s killer narrative Combine the market caps of AI crypto and meme coins and you’re looking at the best part of $200 billion. These golden sectors of 2024 have birthed the sector you won’t be able to ignore in 2025: AI meme coins are already boasting a market cap of over $6 billion at press time. And AI meme coins have only really been a thing for a couple of months. Goatseus Maximus, very much the godfather and quintessential AI meme coin, autonomously shot to fame in October, racking up a +$1 billion market cap and over 1000% in gains in about a month. Meanwhile, ai16z has produced over 5000% gains, a similar market cap to Goatseus Maximus, and has an enviable chart . It’s basically bathing in diamond-handed investors. Why the final weeks of iDEGEN’s presale are such a big deal iDEGEN is holding an adaptive auction for its IDGN token. Every 5 minutes, the price updates. If there are buyers in consecutive 5-minute periods, the price pumps 5%. No back-to-back buyers, and the price declines by 5%. This mechanism uses market forces to ensure that IDGN begins open trading at the price investors want to pay. And not some random price set by the dev team. This mitigates token dumping on launch. Investors have already welcomed over 54,991%. And with only a matter of days left, the opportunity to catch IDGN at what’s looking like its lowest possible price is rapidly slipping away.

Buying ai16z today gives investors early access to the next behemoth, easily rivaling the likes of OpenAI. So when ai16z dipped, Vantard jumped right in and was singing about its gains not long after. Zooming out, Vantard’s portfolio is already up in 39% and is currently smashing everything in sight, from the NASDAQ to BTC. Source: Vantard AI memecoins were inevitable Ever since the meme prophet Murad dropped his truth bombs at Token 2049, it’s become abundantly clear that memecoins are a) here to stay and b) will be this cycle’s golden sector. They’ve already outperformed other “legit” sectors. And are currently valued at well over $100 billion . Ultimately, all cryptos are a meme and a community. For any crypto to succeed, attention is needed. This is where AI memecoins change the game. Instead of relying on human intelligence—which was so last bull run—an AI agent can post and respond to its community at 100 times the pace. This is the kind of attention-grabbing, community-building, viral marketing-harnessing that memecoins thrive on. AI is essentially memecoin steroids. This is why Vantard bet the farm early, and all its early investors have been laughing all the way to the bank. This is why Vantard is creating its own AI agent Vantard has gone one step beyond investing in AI tokens and has announced it will be launching its own AI quant. It is leveling up its investing power by launching an AI agent trained to trade memecoins 24/7. As with ai16z, Vantard saw this opportunity a long time ago. The agent will have its very own, unique AI data feeds, and will act as the first on-chain AI quant. Constant activity in the trenches. Constant gem hunting. Covering all the bases that the human quants don’t have time for. Things are starting to look very exciting for all early buyers, and the current $0.00011 smells like a big discount. Vantard launching January: Why memecoins are only just getting started Markets have already seen memecoins print multiple all-time highs and haven’t so much as touched the mad season that 2025 is set to be. Aside from last cycle’s retail money pouring into coins like XRP and ADA, the normies haven’t even considered buying yet. Plus, US politics is going to be the mother of all shills. Degens are in the White House. Musk is running DOGE in the USA today . And most importantly, there is a Solana ETF in the works. This is essentially TradFi saying, “We like the look of this whole degen thing these guys are doing.” Vantard will burst onto exchanges on 15th January 2025, just in time to watch the manic season blossom and the start of Trump’s crypto party. Bringing on the kinds of all-time highs many people thought were impossible. Memecoins are too exciting right now to miss out on. And Vantard is your FOMO insurance.

37922416,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631492,1734783805,Bitcoin price surges to $99K hours after record Bitcoin ETF outflow,"Bitcoin’s price surge toward the $100,000 mark on December 20 appeared bittersweet for investors in the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While Bitcoin briefly exceeded $99,000 earlier in the day, the positive price movement contrasted sharply with the net outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs, which saw a significant drain of capital. Monday began on a positive note for Bitcoin (BTC) investors, with the cryptocurrency’s price rising from around $101,000 to surpass $108,000 by Tuesday, marking a new all-time high. Expectations were high for a potential rise toward $110,000, especially following the US rate cut on Wednesday. However, Bitcoin’s momentum quickly stalled, and the cryptocurrency began retracing its gains. Bitcoin first dropped below $100,000, and the selling pressure continued as the price fell further, reaching a three-week low of $92,000 on Friday. This prompted speculation about whether the market was undergoing a normal correction or if it was the end of the ongoing bull run. Record outflows and price pressures On December 20, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a net outflow of $277 million, as reported by several sources, including Farside Investors. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) faced its largest net outflows on record, shedding $72.7 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw a net outflow of $57.36 million. According to Sosovalue data, the total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs stood at $109.7 billion by the end of the day, a notable decrease from the $121.7 billion recorded on December 17. Bitcoin spot ETFs outflows – Source: Sosovalue This decline in BTC ETF assets followed a particularly tough day for the sector on December 19, when Bitcoin ETFs logged an astonishing $671.9 million in net outflows, the largest single-day outflow of the year. The outflows were led by Grayscale’s GBTC, which lost $208.6 million, followed by ARK Invest’s ARKB, which saw a decrease of $108.4 million. These outflows coincided with BTC’s price dipping to around $96,409, exacerbating the market downturn, which saw over $1 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Ethereum ETFs also experience outflows Ethereum’s ETF performance mirrored Bitcoin’s struggles on December 20, with Ethereum spot ETFs facing a net outflow of $75.12 million. As reported by Colin Wu, the total net asset value of Ethereum ETFs stood at $12.16 billion, with cumulative net inflows reaching $2.33 billion. Ethereum spot ETF had a total net outflow of $75.1159 million on December 20, and the total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETF was $12.155 billion. The historical cumulative net inflow has reached $2.328 billion. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/accHR00Ko3 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 21, 2024 While Ethereum’s price suffered during the market-wide crash, it showed signs of recovery by mid-week. Ethereum dropped to $3,300 but rebounded to hover near $3,500, marking a 6% daily increase. Buyers return to the market Bitcoin’s downward spiral slowed towards the end of Friday, and buyers returned to the market, leading to a resurgence in price. On December 20, Bitcoin made an impressive rebound, surpassing $99,000 before stabilizing at around $98,500. Bitcoin’s price over the weekend – Source: TradingView The rebound in BTC’s price can be attributed, in part, to renewed buying activity, particularly on the largest US exchange, Coinbase. After a period of sell-side pressure, buyers began to step in, helping to halt BTC’s freefall. “Coinbase buying a lot since lows,” noted popular trader Exitpump on X, who pointed to the contrast between buying volumes on Coinbase and Binance. This influx of buying support helped buoy Bitcoin’s price and reversed its recent downward trend. Altcoins recover as the market turns green The broader cryptocurrency market, which had been rocked by the sharp downturn earlier in the week, saw altcoins begin to recover. Several altcoins that had taken significant hits during the market-wide crash started to gain ground. Crypto market recovery – Source: TradingView BNB, SOL, TRX, and HBAR each posted daily increases of 5-6%. More substantial gains were seen from the likes of DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, TON, and DOT, which saw double-digit increases. As the market steadied, many altcoins were recovering their losses, offering a glimmer of hope for investors after a turbulent period. The significant rebound of Ethereum and other top altcoins signaled potential stabilization for the broader cryptocurrency sector, though BTC’s performance remained the key focus for market participants. With BTC’s price still hovering near $98,500, traders and investors are closely monitoring the asset’s next moves, hoping it will regain and maintain levels above $100,000.

37922127,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375550,1734783746,"This is How Much Crypto Users Grew in 2024, According to Flipside’s On-Chain Analysis","The crypto industry grew remarkably in 2024 amid rising coin prices, but the same cannot be said for on-chain users across most relevant chains. A 2024 on-chain user report by the blockchain growth platform Flipside revealed a need for networks to offer quantity and quality on-chain activity to attract users and turn them into high-value contributors. According to the report shared with CryptoPotato , only Base, the layer-2 network launched by the largest American crypto exchange, Coinbase, experienced exponential growth in user count for 2024. Other networks, like Bitcoin and some Ethereum-based layer-2 chains, struggled to maintain their growth or even attract new users throughout the year. Base and Ethereum Take the Lead Flipside’s report revealed that Base’s monthly acquired users skyrocketed by 56x this year despite starting slow in January. In October 2024, the crypto space saw its newly acquired users surge to a record 19.4 million, however, Base contributed 13.7 million, almost 8x the second highest-contributing chain, Polygon. During this year, Base also attracted 15.1 million super users executing over 100 decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions. This growth was 38.4% more than that of the next chain, Ethereum, which saw 10.7 million super users. Besides Base, Ethereum also saw impressive growth in its user activity. The second-largest crypto network averaged 1.56 million acquired users per month, surpassing its layer-2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism. The chain’s DeFi-related super users amounted to 10.9 million, crushing Arbitrum and Optimism’s respective 6.2 million and 1.8 million user count. Flipside noted that the growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies likely drove this growth across some chains. Notable developments, such as the leading asset manager Grayscale listing several new cryptocurrencies as “assets under consideration,” must also have fueled the growth. Bitcoin Users Barely Grew On the other hand, Bitcoin’s acquired users grew by 935,900 monthly despite bitcoin’s (BTC) historic surge above the $100,000 level and the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. During bitcoin’s major rally in March, the network saw a 19.2% uptick in acquired users monthly. Unfortunately, Bitcoin’s acquired users dropped 28.5% during the post-U.S. election rally in November. Flipside said this development indicates widespread speculative activity among existing Bitcoin users and not significant new user onboarding. Meanwhile, the decentralized exchange Uniswap maintained and expanded its dominance across major chains, especially on Base and Ethereum.

Recent reports suggesting that Donald Trump’s fund is investing in XRP have sparked speculation about its impact on the token’s value. Currently trading at $2.30, XRP has climbed over 16% in the last 24 hours, recovering after a slight dip earlier in the week. Is Trump Betting Big on Crypto? Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management, recently claimed that Donald Trump and his son Eric have been actively investing in digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Hedera (HBAR), and Ripple’s XRP. Yusko believes these investments could position Trump as a significant player in cryptocurrency markets, especially with potential ETF approvals for HBAR and XRP on the horizon. BREAKING: Famous hedge fund manager confirms that President Trump is buying $HBAR and $XRP This intensifies the earlier testimony by someone close to the Trump transition team regarding Trump planning a national reserve of made in America cryptocurrencies under the… pic.twitter.com/Y49taNQI0u — Shawn (@oroogle) December 20, 2024 Whales Are Buying XRP Trump’s rumored crypto involvement may be fueling optimism around XRP. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez shared that whales have purchased 80 million XRP since the recent price correction began on December 17, signaling strong interest from large investors. Adding to the excitement, a crypto analyst compared XRP’s current price movement to its 2017 bull run. The analysis suggests XRP could repeat its earlier rally, potentially reaching $8–$13. This historical pattern has encouraged XRP holders to anticipate a significant price surge. Yusko also pointed to rumors of a possible exemption for U.S.-based cryptocurrencies from capital gains tax. If implemented, this could dramatically change how crypto is treated in the U.S. and reshape the market’s future. XRP’s Potential vs. Yusko’s Criticism Despite the recent buzz, Yusko expressed doubts about XRP’s long-term potential, criticizing both XRP and Cardano for a lack of groundbreaking innovation. However, he remains optimistic about the U.S. government’s changing attitude toward cryptocurrencies. Figures like Scott Bessent and the potential new SEC chair have openly supported digital assets, signaling possible regulatory shifts. The Road Ahead for XRP Speculation is growing that Trump’s team may include XRP and HBAR in a national cryptocurrency reserve. Shawn, a Hedera supporter, claimed that the administration aims to classify these tokens as “American Commodities” to strengthen the U.S.’s position in the global crypto market.

The collaboration between Tether and Rumble marks a strong stance in favor of free speech and financial freedom, according to statements from both companies. In a December 20 post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino expressed the company’s commitment to supporting technologies and businesses that promote resilience and independence. “Tether deeply believes in the fundamental values of freedom of speech and financial freedom,” Ardoino emphasized, framing the investment as a strategic step toward empowering individuals. Ambitions to Challenge YouTube Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski welcomed the investment, underscoring his determination to disrupt YouTube’s dominance. In a statement on social media, Pavlovski said, “YouTube, lookout. I’m coming for your monopolistic market share globally.” The partnership aims to integrate advertising, cloud services, and crypto payment solutions, strengthening Rumble’s position as a competitive platform. The announcement immediately impacted Rumble’s stock price, with shares (RUM) soaring by 51.60% in after-hours trading, hitting $10.90, according to Google Finance. This surge reflects market confidence in the alliance between Tether and Rumble, as well as growing interest in platforms that prioritize free expression . Bitcoin on Rumble Balance Sheet In addition to its partnership with Tether, Rumble recently decided to add Bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet. The decision follows a social media poll conducted by Pavlovski in November, where 93.9% of 43,790 respondents voted in favor of the move. Rumble’s board of directors approved a strategy to allocate up to $20 million from its excess cash reserves toward Bitcoin acquisitions. This step aligns with the platform’s focus on financial innovation and decentralization, positioning it as a forward-thinking player in the tech and crypto sectors. Tether’s investment and Rumble’s bold financial strategies signal a growing alignment between decentralized technologies and platforms advocating for free speech.

With massive funds raised and big names backing the event, all eyes are on what could be a historic celebration. The inauguration committee has already collected $200 million, and the fund is expected to cross $225 millioThe inauguration committee has already raised $200 million, with expectations that the total will surpass $225 million before the big day. Surprisingly, much of this funding comes from the cryptocurrency industry, marking a first in U.S. political history. Why Crypto Giants Are Backing Trump Trump ran his campaign as a pro-crypto candidate, pledging to remove restrictive policies and promising a regulatory framework to help the crypto sector grow. This clear stance has gained him significant support from major players in the digital asset space. Ripple, locked in a legal battle with the SEC, has reportedly contributed over $5 million to the inauguration fund. Other major crypto companies like Coinbase and Kraken have also joined in, each donating at least $1 million. Some firms, such as MoonPay, have declined to disclose their contributions, adding a layer of intrigue to their involvement. A Pro-Crypto Cabinet in the Making Trump’s presidency could bring sweeping changes for cryptocurrency regulation. His first big move: appointing pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC chairman on Inauguration Day. Reports suggest that Trump plans to fill his cabinet with other crypto-friendly figures, including Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has welcomed these appointments, calling them a “fresh start” for the crypto industry. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What Happened in Crypto This Week?

Maksim Balashevich noted that to gauge the health of the market, it is important to analyze the average dollar investment age (MDIA). This metric reflects the average age of coins in a wallet and can indicate whether assets are actively traded or held: A decline in MDIA indicates that younger coins are circulating in the market, indicating active participation and optimism. Conversely, a rising MDIA could indicate accumulation that could lead to a recession in the market if not accompanied by new buying pressure. “Seeing that the average invested dollar age is falling is a positive sign. It confirms the upward price movements and shows that the assets are entering a healthy cycle,” said Maksim Balashevich. Analysts say that recent market conditions show signs of accumulation, with investors remaining confident in the market despite price corrections. Maksim Balashevich warned that this could signal a long-term uptrend, but could also be a precursor to short-term fluctuations. Related News: What Will Happen for Cryptocurrencies in 2025? Here are the Analyst's Opinions for the Trump Administration “When you see accumulation and the price starts to rise slightly after a decline, it usually indicates strong belief among investors. However, this can lead to vulnerability if there is excessive optimism without sufficient buying pressure,” he said. Santiment analysts also looked at the historical course of market activity in the final months of the year. In previous years, including 2017 and 2021, there were significant swings in December and major corrections after all-time highs. “This year has been a big tax year for many institutional and individual investors who profited from crypto and stocks,” said Maksim Balashevich, suggesting that even if long-term fundamentals remain strong, year-end profit-taking for tax purposes could lead to further price declines. Despite the short-term turmoil, Santiment analysts remain optimistic about 2025. They predict softer market conditions in early 2025 as the industry matures and adapts to macroeconomic factors. *This is not investment advice.

On-chain data shows that large wallets poured millions into both during the recent market meltdown. The market-wide crash that began in the middle of the business week caught many by surprise, given the billions of dollars worth of liquidations that were evident on a couple of occasions. All crypto assets headed south vigorously, with BTC leading the way by plummeting from over $108,000 on Tuesday to $92,000 on Friday. As it typically happens, the altcoins were not sparred, just the opposite. Dogecoin and Ripple were among the worst-performing assets at one point. The largest meme coin stood north of $0.41 before the correction began but dumped by over 35% to its low on Friday of $0.26. XRP’s price plummet was almost identical as the asset came crashing down from $2.72 on Tuesday to $1.96 – a 28% drop. However, both have bounced off since those lows, with DOGE trading close to $0.34 (30% higher) and XRP at $2.3 ( up by 17% ). On-chain data shared by the popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shows that whales tracking both assets didn’t sit on the sideline but actually went on an accumulation spree. In Ripple’s case, they stacked up on 80 million tokens since the retracement began on December 17.

The Bitcoin weekly RSI suggests that demand is still very high for BTC. Altcoins are undergoing a brief correctional phase after reaching overbought levels. The crypto market crashed significantly in the past few days after Bitcoin (BTC) hit $108K. Traders secured profits once BTC reached $100K, while Ether (ETH) fell below $4,000 and now stands at $3,480. BTC dominance soared to 56.8%, which pushed altcoins lower. The market leader remains at $97.6K, down 10% from its peak. The Greed and Fear Index shows 62, reflecting considerable demand for BTC and other digital assets. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin on the weekly chart reads 69.86, suggesting a longer-term bullish outlook. On the daily chart, RSI turned neutral. As seen in the chart provided by TradingView above, the gradient of the weekly RSI line is on a sharp decline, which means that lower prices might be seen for a brief period before the bulls take chart once again.

After several media notifications following his potential destination, Mangione arrived in New York and will be remanded at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Coincidentally, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is also housed in the same jail. Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year sentence for his part in the collapse of his firm. Aside from Bankman-Fried, another high-profile individual in the same detention center is famous music producer Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, who is facing charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking offenses. Combs, who is reportedly sharing a space with Bankman-Fried, is also engaging in the services of the former crypto company’s CEO. UnitedHealth Group CEO’s shooter remanded in solitary confinement Before its collapse , FTX was one of the biggest crypto exchanges globally, providing all kinds of services to its users. Aside from its buying and selling services, users were allowed to bet on the price of diverse tokens and assets listed on the platform. However, things turned sour in 2022, when the exchange went bankrupt leading to billions of dollars going up in smoke. Bankman-Fried was later arrested in connection with the collapse, and after months of protracted legal tussle, he was subsequently sentenced to jail. Meanwhile, Mangione was charged as the key suspect in the murder of the UnitedHealth Group CEO. The executive was murdered on December 4, in New York, with the murder and the manhunt that followed making global headlines. According to details, the police tracked and arrested Mangione at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania some days later. Prosecutors noted that Mangione had been orchestrating the murder months before he carried out the act, citing contempt for the CEO as his motive. According to a prison consultant with knowledge about Mangione’s housing, the suspect, who is still in solitary confinement, could be put in the same place with both SBF and Combs by Monday. Mangione is in solitary confinement, in a small cinderblock Special Housing Unit called ‘the SHU’ or ‘the hole’, according to the official. Mangione is expected to have his meals in the cells, with only an hour of recreation or showering and guards are to check on him at 15-minute intervals. If found guilty, the Judge may rule on a possible death penalty for the suspect. SBF is doing well in jail as FTX releases repayment deadline Sam Bankman-Fried is reportedly doing well in jail, with several reports saying that he is being treated well. A recent interview with Williams Cohan of Puck News showed the former FTX CEO is still in great spirits. With SBF set to serve 25 years in jail, he may only serve half if he keeps up good behavior. He appealed his fraud charges in September, attacking the judge who oversaw his conviction. SBF had been found guilty of allegations against him by a federal jury, as he attempted to steal $8 billion from users of his crypto exchange. In his appeal, his legal counsel pointed at the ruling’s limitation on SBF’s ability to introduce new materials integral to his case, noting that the judge already presumed him guilty. FTX, on its part, has released its repayment timeline, announcing the date and method of repaying its creditors. With the announcement, the firm is nearing the end of its Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings. The exchange’s approved date will take effect on January 3, giving the platform a 60-day window to commence repayments. In its announcement, the repayments will be facilitated through Kraken and BitGo, with users expected to finalize their KYC verifications and onboard on the selected exchanges.

In the meantime, the third-generation token Cardano remains sure of a consolidated ascending trend regardless of growing bearish influence. Therefore, the ADA price is believed to revamp a strong rise, intending to mark a new ATH before the end of the year. Cardano is among the tokens believed to surpass 20% growth, leveraging innovation, scalability, and market adaptability to redefine the altcoin landscape. Meanwhile, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson outlines the roadmap of the platform, which is expected to prioritise decentralisation and governance. Therefore, there is a huge chance that the ADA price will maintain a steep ascending trend if the bulls manage to rise above certain levels before the yearly close. The ADA price has rebounded from the interim support levels just below $0.75, which appeared to be the fresh monthly bottoms. Although the bulls have triggered a rebound, the intensity remains lower as the recovery volume has not reached the required levels. Besides, the technicals continue to remain within the bearish range, which suggests the selling pressure continues to haunt the Cardano price rally. The DMI just triggered a bullish crossover but the levels failed to divert from each other, suggesting a drop in volatility. Moreover, they could be heading towards a bearish crossover while the ADX continues to maintain a descending trend. On the other hand, the RSI has triggered a bullish divergence, which is yet to be validated. Therefore, the Cardano (ADA) price is expected to surge by 20% and reclaim the yearly highs above $0.125 only if the weekly close occurs above $0.98. Otherwise, a pullback could cause the price to reach the monthly lows at $0.75 or levels below if bearish strength intensifies.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/cardano-offering-an-optimal-entry-point-is-ada-primed-to-rally-higher-in-coming-weeks/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37921164,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631482,1734781590,"US to blacklist Sophgo over Huawei AI chip scandal, links to Bitmain founder","The US government is preparing to blacklist Chinese company Sophgo over its role in an illegal chip scandal tied to Huawei, according to recent reports . Sophgo allegedly provided a key AI chip for Huawei’s Ascend 910B processor—one of the most advanced AI chips ever developed by a Chinese company. The chip was manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and sourced under questionable circumstances. Sophgo now faces the US Commerce Department’s Entity List, a trade blacklist used to punish companies acting against American national security or foreign policy interests. Once on the list, companies lose access to critical US technologies and products unless granted a license, which almost never happens. Sophgo, a lesser-known affiliate of crypto mining giant Bitmain, is the latest Chinese firm accused of helping Huawei bypass restrictions imposed by the US since 2019. Sophgo’s connection to Huawei exposed through tech investigation The scandal began when tech researchers at TechInsights took apart Huawei’s Ascend 910B chip. What they found was a design matching a chip Sophgo had ordered from TSMC . This discovery triggered a domino effect. TSMC, the world’s largest chipmaker, immediately stopped shipping to Sophgo. According to the chip giant, it has not supplied Huawei directly since 2020, after US export controls blocked foreign companies from providing advanced chips to Huawei without explicit licenses. In November, Washington ordered a complete halt on shipments of advanced seven-nanometer or smaller chips to Chinese entities. Meanwhile, Huawei denies any active relationship with Sophgo, though evidence suggests otherwise. The Ascend 910B chip, released in 2022, was viewed as a key step forward for Chinese AI technology. Huawei, once crippled by US sanctions, is betting on AI chips to reclaim its global standing. Crypto links, shady dealings, and China’s AI ambitions Sophgo’s troubles are not just about Huawei. The company’s roots are entangled with Bitmain, the Bitcoin mining powerhouse founded by Micree Zhan. Corporate filings show Zhan indirectly owns 23% of Sophgo through an investment vehicle. Adding to the problems, Sophgo has communicated with US regulators using Bitmain email addresses, raising questions about its independence. Bitmain, for its part, denies involvement, claiming it has nothing to do with the supply chain investigation. The company’s AI chips have been purchased by Chinese state-run universities, local governments, and even police departments. These institutions are using AI for everything from building research tools to improving surveillance. But Huawei seems undeterred. The company has announced plans to mass-produce its next-generation AI chip, the Ascend 910C, in early 2025. Market analysts believe the new chip will compete directly with Nvidia, the sitting jewel of the US AI chip market.

37921010,https://coinpedia.org/?p=396072,1734781408,"XRP Lawsuit News: Ex-SEC Lawyer Reveals Ripple Was Discussed Weekly, Predicts Possible Dismissal of Appeal","The post XRP Lawsuit News: Ex-SEC Lawyer Reveals Ripple Was Discussed Weekly, Predicts Possible Dismissal of Appeal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News There are rumors that Ripple and the SEC will have a closed meeting, which could lead to a significant development in the XRP case. Speculation suggests that the meeting may result in the case being closed or dropped entirely, with answers expected soon. A user reacted to this, praising the XRP community for its unwavering perseverance. Despite being wrong many times, the community continues to stay positive and hopeful, showing up every month for updates. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel weighed in, saying he has attended hundreds of these meetings, and Ripple has been a topic of discussion in almost every single one. He wrote on X, “I started attending in the late 1990s, and they were already talking about settling with Ripple. It’s always been a highlight of the weekly meeting.” Fagel believes the SEC will continue on its current path for now, filing the opening brief as planned. He also pointed out that the new SEC chair could take some time to be confirmed, and it’s possible that they may vote to dismiss the appeal. Though it’s an unusual step, Fagel thinks it’s a possibility if the right people are in charge. I think they continue on the current path (i.e. file the opening brief as scheduled) for now. It'll take time for the new Chair to be confirmed. Does the new SEC then vote to dismiss the appeal? Maybe. It's highly unprecedented, but I can see Atkins/Peirce/Uyeda taking that step. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) December 20, 2024 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Signals SEC’s Shift Toward Pro-Crypto Innovation , SEC’s Shutdown, RLUSD Live and More In other news, the SEC is preparing for a government shutdown , which could impact its operations.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-solana-memecoin-to-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The biggest crypto has been unable to reclaim the $100K mark even after many recent attempts, which has begun to spread doubt and FOMO among investors. However, analysts suggest that the $99,800 appears to be a make-or-break level for BTC. The global digital assets market cap jumped by over 5% over the last day to stand at $3.43 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume saw a marginal decline but still hit the $280 billion mark. The Fear and Greed index also reflects “Greed” in the market. Bitcoin on the brink of a breakout? Bitcoin is testing a key resistance between the $97,500 and $99,800 price zones. This is the area where around 924K wallets bought over 1.19 million BTC (approximately worth $117 billion). Analysts suggest that a new all-time high could be on the horizon if BTC manages to break above this level. BTC price tried to make a comeback on Saturday morning by jumping more than 3% over the last day. BTC is trading at an average price of $98,319 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is down by 12% to stand at $89 billion. Coinglass data shows that over $134 million worth of long and short bets set on BTC price were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Around $78.32 million worth of liquidated positions (58%) turned out to be long bets. This suggests that investors were hoping Bitcoin price would recover and keep moving toward the $100K mark, but Bitcoin price fluctuated enough to go against the bulls. BTC ETFs bleeding After setting a record high above $108,000 earlier this week, Bitcoin slid over 10% to hit a low of $92,200 area. Meanwhile, smaller tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) also felt the impact. Adding to the bearish sentiment, US Bitcoin ETFs posted a record outflow of $680 million on Thursday, which eventually ended a 15-day streak of continuous inflows. The fresh data shows that Bitcoin spot ETFs are still bleeding, and the net outflow reached $277 million on Friday, December 20. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded a net outflow of $57.36 million bringing its total historical net outflow to $21.29 billion. Its Mini Trust ETF reported an inflow of $6.41 million. Franklin’s ETF EZBC registered a daily net inflow of $5.61 million to lead its total historical net inflow to reach $467.25 million. Bitcoin spot ETFs flow data.

37920631,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666076,1734780642,Bitcoin Market Leverage and Coinbase Premium: What Recent Data Reveals,"As Bitcoin currently faces a downturn and now seeing a recovery suggesting a preparation for its next bull run, market participants appears to be analyzing trends in exchange leverage and liquidity. Particularly, CryptoQuant has pointed out that leverage ratios on centralized exchanges have become a focal point, offering insights into the potential risks and opportunities shaping the crypto market. The platform’s recent data highlights the importance of assessing these ratios to gauge the financial stability of exchanges and the impact on trading dynamics. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Reclaims $100,000, Warning Signs Emerge from Long-Term Investors Leverage Trends And Exchange Stability A detailed analysis revealed that Binance maintains strong reserves relative to its open interest, signaling a strong ability to manage market volatility. In contrast, smaller exchanges like Gate.io and Bybit exhibit higher leverage ratios, raising questions about their capacity to withstand liquidity crunches. According to CryptoQuant, monitoring these metrics has become even more “critical” in light of past events, such as the collapse of FTX in November 2024, which was triggered by insufficient reserves against high open interest. CryptoQuant’s latest findings further highlight the varying leverage strategies employed by major cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance emerged as a leader in maintaining a stable leverage ratio while expanding its Bitcoin open interest from $4.45 billion in December 2023 to $11.64 billion in December 2024. Despite this growth, Binance’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT reserves have consistently exceeded its open interest, ensuring liquidity and stability even during volatile market conditions. The exchange’s leverage ratio, which rose modestly from 12.8 to 13.5 over the past year, remains the lowest among its peers. Conversely, exchanges like Gate.io, Bybit, and Deribit exhibit significantly higher leverage ratios of 106, 86, and 32, respectively. CryptoQuant wrote: These figures show their Bitcoin open interest exceeds or approaches their reserves, with similar patterns observed for Ethereum. Coinbase Premium: A Key Indicator For Bitcoin Traders Beyond leverage ratios, another crucial metric shaping Bitcoin market sentiment is the Coinbase Premium. This indicator, which tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges, is a barometer for institutional demand and market trends. A CryptoQuant analyst named BQYoutube suggested that traders adopt a cautious approach based on Coinbase Premium signals: When the premium is negative, it may be wise to stay on the sidelines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Loses Momentum: Could A Drop To $75,000 Signal The Final Correction? However, a positive premium often signals the return of strong demand, offering a strategic entry point for traders looking to ride major market trends. According to the latest data, this metric currently sits on the negative side, suggesting to stay on the sidelines. BQYoutube added: You might miss few small trends with this approach but at least you can ride all the big trends and avoid losses in dips or downtrends.

A modest $40,000 investment has skyrocketed by an incredible 62,400%, reaching a value of $25 million. However, the token’s meteoric rise has hit a 16% dip in the past 24 hours, reminding traders of crypto’s unpredictable nature. FARTCOIN Becomes a Star According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, FARTCOIN is now Truth Terminal’s biggest asset . The platform holds over $40 million in AI-related tokens, most of it coming from its FARTCOIN holdings. What’s even more impressive is that Truth Terminal didn’t buy the token at market value. Instead, it acquired FARTCOIN for just $40,000, making its profits even more astonishing. This success highlights the power of AI-driven trading platforms and the growing interest in tokens like FARTCOIN. As adoption increases, the token continues to attract attention from traders and investors alike. Binance Futures Fuels FARTCOIN’s Surge FARTCOIN’s rapid growth got another boost after it was listed on Binance Futures. The introduction of USD-margined perpetual contracts with 75x leverage has spurred demand for FARTCOIN and other Solana-based tokens, driving even more activity in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DeBridge (DBR) Hits All-Time High Following Major Bithumb Listing , FARTCOIN’s Robust Performance FARTCOIN has shown incredible growth over time.

Despite its overall success, FARTCOIN has experienced some volatility, with its price dropping 16% in the last 24 hours to around $0.89 .

37921971,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321734,1734780042,Ethereum Growth – Are Five-Digits Next in 2025?,"Ethereum has shown notable recovery, currently trading at $3,474, up 8.50% in the last 24 hours with a robust trading volume of $49.95 billion. Market analysts, including Guy Turner from CoinBureau , are closely observing ETH’s trajectory, hinting at the possibility of five-digit valuations by 2025. His predictions are grounded in technical analysis and broader market trends, underscoring Ethereum’s potential to surpass its historical peak price. Ethereum’s Historical Highs and New Expectations In November 2021, Ethereum reached its all-time high of $4,878. According to Turner, breaking past this level could propel the cryptocurrency to new price tiers, with $7,300 being a key target based on Fibonacci extensions. This 1.618 Fibonacci level is widely recognized as a critical indicator for price expansions beyond previous highs. Despite its recent upward momentum, Ethereum continues to lose value against Bitcoin, currently trading at $98,368. Turner emphasized the importance of Ethereum regaining resistance against Bitcoin to unlock its full price potential. Source: Guy Turner/YouTube However, Ethereum’s performance remains heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s trajectory, with both assets maintaining a close correlation. Bitcoin’s Role in Ethereum’s Outlook Turner suggests that if Bitcoin reaches $200,000 by 2025, Ethereum could potentially soar to $14,600. This projection hinges on increased investment interest in Ethereum as Bitcoin’s price ascends. The analyst believes that surpassing Ethereum’s previous all-time high would signal price discovery, unlocking new peaks for the asset. However, Turner also advises caution, pointing out the volatility in the crypto market. While his predictions offer valuable insights, he urges investors to assess risk factors carefully before making decisions. Ethereum, currently trading at $3,686, remains under scrutiny as it navigates critical resistance and support levels. Ethereum Technical Outlook – December 21, 2024 Ethereum’s short-term price action highlights significant resistance at $3,550, where a downward trendline converges with a supply zone. This level, previously a support area, has flipped to resistance, creating a challenging environment for bullish momentum. Ethereum faces key resistance at $3,550, a critical level where a downward trendline meets a supply zone. A breakout could pave the way to $3,717 and $3,897, while failure risks retesting support at $3,252. RSI at 46 signals neutral momentum. #Ethereum #Crypto #ETH pic.twitter.com/f0qCZ2IZBO — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) December 21, 2024 Key resistance levels include $3,550, $3,717, and $3,897. On the downside, Ethereum finds immediate support at $3,252, with further levels at $3,097 and $2,940. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 46, signaling neutral to slightly bearish conditions. Meanwhile, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) sits below the current price, reinforcing tentative recovery trends. A breakout above $3,550 could ignite bullish momentum, paving the way for higher targets. Conversely, failure to surpass this level may result in renewed selling pressure, with Ethereum retesting support zones.

Kaspa: A Fast and Scalable Cryptocurrency with Unique Technology Kaspa is a cryptocurrency using proof-of-work and the GHOSTDAG protocol. It differs from traditional blockchains by allowing parallel blocks to coexist and organizing them in consensus. This structure forms a blockDAG instead of a linear blockchain, enabling high block rates of 1 block per second with goals for faster speeds. Kaspa offers features like DAG topology queries, data pruning, and SPV proofs, with plans for subnetworks and layer 2 solutions. Its innovative technology allows for quick confirmations and scalability, which could attract attention in the current market. The focus on both speed and flexibility positions Kaspa as a promising option for future blockchain development. TRON (TRX): A Decentralized Platform for Digital Content and dApps TRON (TRX) is a blockchain platform founded in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It began on the Ethereum network but moved to its own blockchain in 2018. TRON aims to give content creators full ownership and better rewards for their work by removing intermediaries. The platform supports smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain systems. It uses a public ledger for transactions and follows a model similar to Bitcoin. TRON enables developers to build dApps and share content while earning digital assets. Its low transaction fees and focus on decentralization make it an alternative to Ethereum. The coin aligns with the growing interest in blockchain-driven solutions for digital content and decentralized technologies. APT: A Scalable Blockchain with Web3 Focus Aptos is a layer-one blockchain created to solve issues like high fees and congestion in older networks. Built by former contributors to Meta’s Diem project, it uses a Proof-of-Stake system and the Move language for smart contracts. Aptos prioritizes safety, scalability, and flexibility, making it suitable for diverse Web3 applications. Its technology shows potential for fast and efficient transactions. In the current market cycle, its focus on scalability and usability could make it appealing to users and developers seeking alternatives to older blockchains. Aave: Decentralized Lending and Borrowing on Ethereum Aave is a cryptocurrency used in a decentralized finance platform on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on digital assets without banks or intermediaries. Transactions are managed by smart contracts, making the system trustless. Aave supports 17 cryptocurrencies for loans. Unique features include flash loans, which are instant loans without collateral that must be repaid in seconds. AAVE tokens give holders benefits like voting rights, fee discounts, and use as collateral. The platform also has a Safety Module, where users can stake tokens to improve security. Aave’s design, limited token supply, and innovative features make it an appealing option depending on market conditions. Conclusion KAS, TRX, APT, and AAVE show steady potential but may provide slower short-term gains. DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for those pursuing peak success and luxury. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and massive returns during the current altcoin season, DOGEN positions itself as the leader for high achievers.

37920336,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631460,1734779739,Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson offers to buy CoinDesk again,"Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has revived his interest in buying CoinDesk in apparent jest, after the crypto media outlet plunged deeper into chaos. Responding to a journalist’s post on X that described CoinDesk as “in shambles,” Charles questioned the outlet’s current valuation. “Remember when we thought about buying Coindesk?” he asked. “I wonder what the price is these days.” The drama began when Bullish, CoinDesk’s parent company, abruptly fired three top editors, including editor-in-chief Kevin Reynolds, after newsroom tensions boiled over an article on TRON founder Justin Sun. Bullish under fire for its newsroom shake-up Sources reportedly confirmed that Bullish dismissed Reynolds, deputy editor-in-chief Nick Baker, and ethics and standards head Marc Hochstein on Friday. The decision followed weeks of unrest at CoinDesk, starting with the removal of an article about Justin’s purchase and staged consumption of a $6.2 million banana art installation. The piece also covered Justin’s legal troubles though, including fraud charges from the SEC, which he disputes. According to insiders, his team pressured Bullish to take the story down, claiming the tone was damaging. Bullish CEO Tom Farley approved the takedown without the usual retraction notice, an action that blindsided the editorial staff. The company attempted damage control by citing “cost reduction measures” as the reason for the layoffs in an email sent by CoinDesk CEO Sara Stratoberdha. Viewed by staff and later leaked, the email claimed the restructuring would boost productivity while reaffirming the company’s commitment to journalistic independence. But few in the newsroom believed it. A senior staffer reportedly described the firings as “devastating,” saying the trio were the “heart of the newsroom.” The same source questioned Bullish’s priorities, adding, “It’s clear they care more about pleasing sponsors than actual reporting.” Another staff member said morale at CoinDesk is at an all-time low, with many employees actively exploring other opportunities. The Justin debacle and its fallout Critics say Justin’s ties to CoinDesk may have influenced the decision to pull the story. TRON is a major sponsor of Consensus, CoinDesk’s flagship conference, which is debuting in Hong Kong this year. The timing is interesting, given Bullish’s rumored plans for an initial public offering. Matt Murray, a former Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief appointed by Bullish to oversee CoinDesk’s editorial direction, resigned in protest after the article was pulled. By Friday, the tensions culminated in a dramatic showdown. Reynolds, Baker, and Hochstein were locked out of their Slack accounts before the company announced their dismissals. Staff were informed via email after the fact, a decision some described as “cold and calculated.” Charles’ last CoinDesk bid In January, Charles Hoskinson publicly considered purchasing the outlet but balked at its $200 million asking price. At the time, he argued that CoinDesk was overvalued, saying, “You could build a better, decentralized competitor for $5 to $10 million.” Charles has long been critical of crypto journalism, accusing major outlets of bias and inaccuracy. His vision for media reform included ideas like “veracity bonds,” where outlets would stake funds on the accuracy of their reporting, losing the money if stories were proven false. He also suggested integrating blockchain technology into news reporting. Using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), articles could become interactive “living objects.” Once the gold standard for blockchain reporting, CoinDesk made its name exposing fraud and corruption, including its pivotal role in uncovering the FTX scandal in 2022. But under Bullish, the outlet is clearly struggling to maintain its credibility.

BONK surged 30%, CoinGecko data shows, with dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB), dogwifhat (WIF) and floki (FLOKI) surging as much as 20%. The dog-themed token category gained 8% on average in the past 24 hours, beating a market-wide jump of 4.5% as tracked by the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.    Memecoins are known for their high volatility and tend to outperform major tokens during price rallies, serving as a leveraged bet on the overall crypto market sentiment.    However, in this case, fundamentals are helping back gains and sentiment among some memecoins. FLOKI was named alongside ether (ETH) and Avalanche’s AVAX as a utility token in a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) meeting last month.    The derivatives regulator proposed in a Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) a new class of assets termed utility tokens, which fulfill six criteria that include providing their holder “immediately available, non-incidental consumptive use” in a crypto platform without including “governance and voting abilities.”    ""FLOKI was recently highlighted by the CFTC's Global Markets Advisory Committee as a case study of a utility token, which is a big deal and validates Floki's utility-first approach,” Floki lead developer B told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Floki's Valhalla metaverse game will go live in early Q1 2024, and the recently released Floki Trading Bot has generated over a million dollars in fees.    “This puts Floki on an entirely different level from other memecoins, especially when the market turns and people start to pay attention to fundamentals again,” B added.    Elsewhere, interest in BONK comes as a host of activities intend to deflate token supply gain traction among users — a move that has historically contributed to higher prices.    BonkDAO, a decentralized group of bonk believers that maintain the token, burned 100 billion tokens from the circulating supply in November and targeted a trillion token burn in December. This could increase the token's value due to scarcity.      The feat could meet its target in the weeks ahead, observers say.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB | BONK,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/21/bonk-rockets-30-to-lead-dog-meme-rebound-floki-termed-utility-token-by-cftc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2da47252f94b6178d17c7a84fa44a06322d70883-2400x1597.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This has left many wondering how it could impact crypto’s current four-year boom-bust cycle and lead to a crypto supercycle. Earlier this year, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the Bitcoin Reserve Act. Texas and Pennsylvania have also introduced proposals to establish a state Bitcoin reserve. Can A Bitcoin Reserve Impact Current Cycles? Besides the US, several countries like Russia, Germany, and Thailand are contemplating similar proposals. If governments attempt to create a stockpile of Bitcoin (BTC), could it impact crypto prices and the four-year boom-bust cycle attributed to Bitcoin's halving event? Some analysts like Iliya Kalchev believe the Bitcoin Reserve Act could be a landmark moment for Bitcoin and signal its recognition as a legitimate financial instrument. Bitcoin has already garnered significant attention from major financial institutions, who have started adding it to their reserves. Kalchev stated, “Every Bitcoin cycle has a narrative trying to push the idea that ‘this one is different.' The conditions have never been so ideal. Crypto has never had a pro-crypto US President who controls the Senate and the Congress.” The Bitcoin Reserve Act would allow the US government to add Bitcoin to its treasury as a reserve asset. The act states that the government must buy 200,000 BTC annually over five years and hold the asset for at least twenty years. Jack Mallers, founder and CEO of Strike, believes Trump could issue an executive order to purchase Bitcoin. However, he added that it would not equate to a 1 million BTC purchase. “It wouldn't be the size and scale of 1 million coins, but it would be a significant position.” Dennis Porter, the co-founder of the non-profit act Satoshi Act Fund, which supports pro-Bitcoin US policy bills, also believes Trump is exploring the option of creating a reserve through an executive order. “I can confirm that Trump is exploring an Executive Order creating a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.’ The Treasury, through the Exchange Stabilization Fund, has the authority to stabilize the dollar by buying currencies. Trump will use this fund to buy Bitcoin.” Is Bitcoin Already In A Supercycle? Alex Kruger, economist and founder of macro digital advisory firm Asgard Markets, believes the election results indicate Bitcoin is already in a supercycle. He compared Bitcoin’s current situation with gold, which jumped from $35 per ounce in 1971 to $850 in 1981 after President Richard Nixon took the US off the gold standard. Kruger did not rule out the possibility of another bear cycle but urged investors to compare this cycle with previous ones. A Domino Effect If passed, the act could kick off a race as other countries scramble to create their own Bitcoin strategic reserves. Analysts believe enacting the Bitcoin Reserve Act would be a turning point for global Bitcoin adoption and become one of the most bullish events in crypto history by catalyzing a race to acquire as much BTC as possible.

He described the investment as a strategic step in supporting technologies and companies that empower individuals and foster societal resilience. Ardoino Expresses Confidence in Rumble Leadership Ardoino expressed confidence in Rumble’s leadership under CEO Chris Pavlovski, praising the platform’s achievements and hinting at future collaboration. Tether and Rumble aim to explore joint initiatives involving advertising, cloud services, and crypto payment solutions. Pavlovski, sharing Ardoino’s enthusiasm, took to X to express his determination to challenge YouTube’s dominance in the video-sharing market. “YouTube, lookout. I’m coming for your monopolistic market share globally,” he declared. YouTube, lookout. I’m coming for your monopolistic market share, globally. — Chris Pavlovski (@chrispavlovski) December 20, 2024 The announcement triggered a sharp rise in Rumble’s stock price (RUM), which surged 51.60% during after-hours trading, reaching $10.90, according to Google Finance. Rumble’s embrace of cryptocurrency extends beyond Tether’s investment. On November 25, the platform confirmed plans to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet, with its board approving up to $20 million of the company’s excess cash reserves for Bitcoin purchases. The decision followed a poll by Pavlovski, where 93.9% of 43,790 respondents supported the proposal. Cantor Fitzgerald Acquires 5% Stake in Tether Financial services giant Cantor Fitzgerald has acquired a 5% stake in Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, in a deal valued at up to $600 million. The acquisition, which occurred within the past year, positions the firm to potentially leverage political influence through its CEO Howard Lutnick, who was recently appointed as U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump’s Secretary of Commerce. Cantor Fitzgerald’s involvement with Tether could bolster the stablecoin issuer’s standing amid increasing regulatory scrutiny. Tether has faced ongoing investigations from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York regarding alleged use of its stablecoin, USDT, in illicit activities such as terrorism financing. Amid these challenges, Lutnick’s political clout may play a pivotal role in navigating regulatory hurdles. Tether’s largest shareholder, Giancarlo Devasini, reportedly expressed confidence in Lutnick’s ability to “defuse threats facing Tether,” according to sources cited in the WSJ. Lutnick, who has been working closely with Trump as a transition advisor, is vetting candidates for key government roles, some of which could directly impact oversight of Tether. He is expected to step down as Cantor Fitzgerald’s CEO upon Senate confirmation of his cabinet position.

In an interview shared by crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) on X, Yusko claimed that Trump, through a family-controlled entity, is acquiring various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Hedera, and XRP. The post’s caption amplified the claims, suggesting a strategic move by Trump into digital assets. Yusko stated that Trump and his son, are purchasing cryptocurrencies that could be approved for exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While Yusko implied that Trump himself might lack direct knowledge of these investments, his comments suggest a strategic move by the president-elect into the crypto space. WOW!

Over the past year, interest in cryptocurrency ETFs has surged, with several applications for spot XRP ETFs currently under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator has approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , leading to significant increases in institutional interest in these assets, and market growth. XRP has been touted by many including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse as the next candidate for ETF approval. The asset’s legal clarity and popularity have heightened its appeal.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Rumors and Implications This isn’t the first time Trump’s name has been linked to cryptocurrency. Recent rumors suggested that Trump planning to include Hedera and XRP in a proposed U.S. strategic crypto reserve. However, these claims were refuted by Charles Hoskinson , the founder of Cardano, who tagged them as unfounded. Despite the denials, speculation continues to swirl, fueled by Trump’s reported ties to World Liberty Financial, a financial institution inspired by his business and political persona. Many in the crypto community believe this connection indicates his growing interest in digital assets. Trump has consistently supported cryptocurrencies. He even accepted crypto donations during his campaign. If Yusko’s claims are accurate, Trump’s involvement could have broader implications for the cryptocurrency industry. High-profile endorsements or investments often attract significant attention and legitimacy to the market. Given Trump’s influence and political standing, his participation could encourage other investors, including institutional players, to follow suit.

37919846,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631464,1734778803,"Inflation headed higher in 2025, and Fed needs damage control – Peter Schiff","Peter Schiff, the chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, has voiced strong concerns over the Federal Reserve’s recent economic strategy. In a post on X, Schiff warned that the Fed’s policies are leading to long-term damage, particularly regarding inflation. According to Schiff, inflation is expected to rise in the coming year. He suggested that any future rate cuts by the Fed would likely be aimed at averting a financial crisis, boosting asset markets, or providing relief to struggling banks and labor markets, not to reduce inflation. Fed officials were doing damage control today following Powell's comments on Wednesday. Inflation is likely headed higher next year. So, if the Fed does cut rates, it's only to avert a financial crisis, prop up asset markets, bail out banks, or to ""stimulate"" a weak labor market. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2024 On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reduced its key interest rate by a quarter-point, marking the third rate cut this year. The move, however, was coupled with a notable shift in the central bank’s outlook for 2025. The Fed now expects to slow the pace of rate cuts next year, primarily due to persistent inflation. US Fed change 2025 economic projections According to recent reports, the US central bank’s projections for the rate have been revised upward to 3.9%, up from 3.4% in September. Additionally, inflation expectations were adjusted from 2.1% to 2.5%, indicating a more difficult battle ahead in the coming years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell defended the decision during a news conference, stating that the slower pace of rate cuts reflects both the higher-than-expected inflation this year and the anticipation of continued inflationary pressure into 2025. Despite the rate reduction, Powell’s comments suggested a future trajectory of slow and cautious cuts to address inflation concerns. Schiff, appearing on Fox Business after the Fed’s announcement, criticized Powell’s rhetoric, particularly his portrayal of the Fed’s hawkish stance on inflation. Schiff argued that Powell’s actions did not align with his words, pointing out that the Fed’s early rate cuts were premature. He contended that rates never reached restrictive levels, and cutting them further now would be a mistake. Schiff also expressed skepticism over Powell’s claim that inflation could return to the Fed’s target of 2% in two years. He believes inflation will remain elevated, dismissing Powell’s projections as overly optimistic. “Inflation won’t be anywhere near 2% in two years. It’s going to be higher than it is right now,” Schiff remarked. Impact of deficits and fiscal policy concerns Schiff warned that the US may be heading for a scenario that could complicate economic conditions for the incoming Trump administration. As the administration prepares to take office in January, Schiff speculated that Trump may inherit a fragile economic environment marked by a sluggish economy and heightened financial risks. Schiff’s concerns also extended to broader fiscal issues. A recent article on SchiffGold, that the economist reposted on X, highlighted the US government’s ballooning deficit. According to the latest figures from the Treasury Department, the US government spent $668 billion in November, adding to October’s $584 billion in spending. This brings the total deficit for the first two months of the 2025 fiscal year to a staggering $624 billion, the highest such total ever recorded for this period. Source: Treasury Department With government revenues amounting to just $628 billion, the US is on track for a record deficit by the end of the fiscal year, potentially exceeding $3.5 trillion. Schiff warns that this unprecedented spending is draining the real economy, and such fiscal policies could lead to long-term economic instability. Schiff’s criticism of Trump’s policy suggestions Schiff also criticized President-elect Trump’s approach to international energy markets, particularly his suggestion that the European Union should increase its purchase of US oil and gas. The economist argues that this would lead to reduced domestic supply and rising energy prices for Americans. #Trump wants the EU to buy more U.S. oil and gas. If they do, the added demand will reduce domestic supply, pushing up energy prices for Americans. Also, if dollars are used to buy oil and gas instead of buying our debt, the result will be higher bond yields and mortgage rates. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2024 He further contended that if dollars were used to buy US energy exports instead of financing debt, the result would be higher bond yields and mortgage rates, exacerbating economic challenges for households. Yesterday, Schiff took a dig at Trump’s “cutting costs” policies, saying the US President-elect is campaigning for debt reduction, yet he is forcing the hand of House Republicans to “vote to suspend the debt ceiling for the next two years.” He believes this will set up the US Congress to “run up an unlimited amount of debt.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/2025-inflation-fed-damage-control-schiff/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37919846.jpeg

37921967,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321735,1734778792,Michael Saylor Supports Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in New Policy Proposal,"MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor has expressed strong support for President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Detailed in his “ Digital Assets Framework ” policy published Friday, the proposal outlines a roadmap for the United States to foster growth in the digital asset industry, establish clear compliance standards, and ensure defined rights for crypto asset holders and companies. Saylor Says the U.S. Needs to Lead Digital Economy Saylor’s framework noted the importance of the U.S. leading the global digital economy through innovation in digital assets. “By establishing a clear taxonomy, a legitimate rights-based framework, and practical compliance obligations, the United States can lead the global digital economy,” he wrote. He added that such measures could unlock trillions of dollars in wealth, empower millions of businesses, and secure the U.S. dollar’s status as the cornerstone of the digital financial system. A long-time Bitcoin advocate, Saylor gained prominence in 2020 when MicroStrategy began acquiring significant amounts of the cryptocurrency. The company, which primarily provides business intelligence software, now holds an estimated $42.6 billion in Bitcoin, making it the largest corporate holder of the asset. While Saylor is widely regarded as a Bitcoin maximalist, his framework extends beyond Bitcoin, proposing universal standards for all digital assets. He suggested creating a comprehensive taxonomy to classify digital assets, including “digital commodities” like Bitcoin, “digital securities” such as tokenized equity or debt, “digital currencies” backed by fiat, and “digital tokens” offering utility. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and tokens linked to physical assets like gold and oil are also distinctly categorized. MICHAEL SAYLOR: Dump all US gold for 5M #Bitcoin —the trade is free. Demontize enemy gold reserves to zero while we take control of the World's Reserve Capital Network pic.twitter.com/XpWhVtKeuF — Swan (@Swan) December 7, 2024 Saylor’s proposal calls for a robust framework of rights and responsibilities for issuers, exchanges, and other participants in the digital asset ecosystem. This framework would ensure transparency, compliance with local laws, and accountability. “No one has the right to lie, cheat, or steal. All participants are civilly and criminally responsible for their actions,” he emphasized. To encourage innovation, Saylor advocates limiting compliance costs for token issuance to 1% of a firm’s assets under management and reducing annual maintenance costs to no more than 10 basis points. He argued this approach could significantly lower the cost of issuing tokens, from $10–100 million to $10–100 thousand, and reduce the timeline for launching new digital assets to minutes instead of years. Saylor Proposes Growing Stablecoin Market Central to Saylor’s vision is positioning the U.S. dollar as the “global reserve digital currency.” He proposes growing the stablecoin market from its current $25 billion to $10 trillion, which would create substantial demand for U.S. Treasuries and secure the dollar’s dominance. Saylor also supports the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a policy backed by lawmakers like Senator Cynthia Lummis and President-elect Trump. While Saylor did not specify the size of the reserve, he suggested it could create wealth ranging from $16 to $81 trillion, potentially erasing the U.S. national debt of $36 trillion. Trump has reiterated his commitment to retaining the government’s 198,000 BTC acquired through criminal seizures and recently voiced support for a Bitcoin reserve.

37919599,https://finbold.com/?p=221497,1734778465,Bitcoin could see another record high if this ‘brick wall’ is breached,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) is pushing to regain its six-figure valuation following a period where it risked falling below $90,000 support zone. However, on-chain data suggests a new record high could be on the horizon amid the recent volatility. Specifically, data indicates that Bitcoin is currently hovering near a critical price range between $97,500 and $99,800, where over 924,000 addresses previously purchased more than 1.19 million BTC. To this end, prominent on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez identified this zone as a ‘brick wall’ due to the magnitude of Bitcoin accumulated at these levels, he said in an X post on December 21. “Bitcoin faces a brick wall between $97,500 and $99,800. If BTC can manage to break above this level, we could see new all-time highs soon,” Santana noted. Bitcoin in/out of the money around price chart. Source: IntoTheBlock A breakdown of the data shows that wallets holding approximately 583,460 BTC are currently profitable, representing 18.77% of the market. On the other hand, 2.52 million BTC, or 81.09%, is held at higher levels, awaiting price recovery, while a minimal 4,400 BTC is sitting at breakeven. Generally, a break above the $97,500-$99,800 range would signal strong bullish momentum and possibly trigger ‘Fear of Missing Out’ ( FOMO ) from investors on the sidelines. This projection comes after Bitcoin briefly dipped to $92,000 before rebounding as the cryptocurrency market experienced sustained volatility. Notably, these conditions were triggered by the Federal Reserve, which signaled the possibility of fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. Indeed, this scenario saw the market record significant outflows that also impacted spot exchange-traded funds ( ETF ). To this end, on December 19, Bitcoin ETFs recorded a $680 million outflow, the largest in their history. Bitcoin ETFs outflow. Source: Bloomberg What next for Bitcoin? Following the recent price movement, cryptocurrency trading expert Alan Santana stressed in a TradingView post on December 21 that the recent drop is not cause for concern. Santana stated that the drop to $92,000 should be considered a healthy correction. The cryptocurrency has already rebounded to $97,000, reinforcing its bullish momentum. The expert highlighted that $90,000 level, aligning with the 55-day Exponential Moving Average ( EMA ) on the daily chart, is a critical support level that remains untested—a sign of market strength. While $100,000 was temporarily breached, it remains within reach for another attempt. Santana noted that longer-term projections point to key Fibonacci extension levels at $113,968, $138,794, and $163,620 as Bitcoin advances. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

Santana suggested that the next primary growth phase could pick up speed by late February, while periods of consolidation and altcoin expansion provide interim opportunities. “Bitcoin won’t move overnight, it takes time to grow. We are looking at two months, late February, for maximum speed and maximum growth. But we can experience some high, some sideways, some consolidation while the Altcoins grow,” he said.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-exchange-listings-as-shiba-inu-and-pepe-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37919205,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112710,1734777584,Forex Dollar to Philippine Peso: Comprehensive Guide to USD to PHP Exchange,"The foreign exchange market, or forex, plays a pivotal role in determining the value of currencies globally. One of the most actively traded currency pairs in Southeast Asia is the US Dollar (USD) to Philippine Peso (PHP) . Understanding how this exchange works and the factors influencing its value is essential for individuals and businesses engaged in international trade, remittances, or travel. In this guide, we delve deep into the dynamics of the USD to PHP forex market, providing insights into trends, tips for conversion, and key economic factors influencing the exchange rate. What is the Forex Dollar to Philippine Peso Exchange? Forex trading involves the buying and selling of currencies, with rates determined by supply and demand. The USD to PHP exchange rate reflects how much one U.S. Dollar is worth in Philippine Pesos. This rate is influenced by various factors, including economic indicators, market sentiment, and geopolitical developments. Why is USD to PHP Significant? Remittances: The Philippines ranks among the top recipients of remittances globally, with millions of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) sending money back home. Trade Relations: The U.S. is one of the Philippines’ largest trading partners, making USD to PHP crucial for import-export activities. Travel and Tourism: Exchange rates impact travel costs for both American tourists visiting the Philippines and Filipinos traveling to the U.S. How to Check Forex Dollar to Philippine Peso Rates 1. Online Forex Platforms Real-time forex platforms like XE, OANDA, and Google Finance offer updated exchange rates. 2. Banking and Financial Institutions Banks often provide forex conversion rates, but keep in mind they might include additional fees or margins. 3. Currency Conversion Apps Mobile apps like Currency Converter and Forex Trading Pro are handy tools for quick conversions. Factors Affecting USD to PHP Exchange Rates Understanding the factors influencing the USD to PHP forex rate can help predict its movement: 1. Economic Indicators Philippine GDP Growth: A strong GDP can bolster the peso’s value. U.S. Federal Reserve Policies: Interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve often strengthen the USD. 2. Inflation Rates Higher inflation in the Philippines compared to the U.S. can weaken the peso, as it reduces purchasing power. 3.

37919144,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112701,1734777472,U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs See $277.08M in Outflows Amid Market Uncertainty,"U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) faced significant outflows on December 20, 2024, with a combined net outflow of $277.08 million, according to data shared by Trader T on X (formerly Twitter). This marks the second consecutive day of declines for Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting potential concerns about market sentiment or profit-taking among investors. The majority of outflows were attributed to prominent funds, including ARK Invest’s ARKB, BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s GBTC. While most ETFs faced net losses, Grayscale Mini BTC and Franklin’s EZBC bucked the trend with modest inflows. Breakdown of ETF Outflows Major ETFs Affected ARK Invest’s ARKB : $87.01 million in net outflows, representing the largest single loss. BlackRock’s IBIT : $72.84 million in outflows, a significant figure for the world’s largest asset manager. Fidelity’s FBTC: $71.89 million in outflows, continuing a challenging period for Bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale’s GBTC : $57.36 million in outflows, despite being one of the earliest Bitcoin-focused funds. ETFs with Net Inflows Grayscale Mini BTC (MBTC): Recorded $6.41 million in inflows, suggesting investor interest in smaller-cap ETFs. Franklin’s EZBC: Gained $5.61 million, likely benefiting from diversification strategies. Market Context: Why the Outflows? The significant outflows could be driven by several factors: 1. Profit-Taking by Investors With Bitcoin’s price stabilizing above $100,000 in recent months, investors may be locking in profits, leading to reduced exposure in ETFs. 2. Year-End Portfolio Adjustments The December timing aligns with traditional portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors, who may be reallocating funds to meet year-end financial goals. 3. Macro and Regulatory Concerns Ongoing regulatory developments and global economic uncertainty could be influencing risk-averse behavior, particularly in volatile assets like Bitcoin. Impact on Bitcoin Market Sentiment The ETF outflows highlight shifting market dynamics: Short-Term Concerns Price Volatility: Declining interest in ETFs could contribute to short-term price fluctuations for Bitcoin. Weakened Sentiment: Consecutive days of outflows suggest cautious investor behavior. Long-Term Outlook Despite the outflows, the broader demand for Bitcoin remains robust, with institutional interest still driving adoption in key markets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Snapshot What Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs, spot ETFs track the actual Bitcoin price, making them a preferred option for many institutional and retail investors. Importance in the Market Accessibility: Provides a gateway for traditional investors to access Bitcoin. Liquidity: Increases market liquidity by aggregating institutional investments. Regulatory Milestones: Spot ETFs represent significant progress in the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Comparison: ETFs with Inflows vs. Outflows ETF Name Net Flow ($M) Trend ARK Invest (ARKB) -87.01 Outflow BlackRock (IBIT) -72.84 Outflow Fidelity (FBTC) -71.89 Outflow Grayscale (GBTC) -57.36 Outflow Grayscale Mini BTC +6.41 Inflow Franklin EZBC +5.61 Inflow Implications for Investors What to Watch For Market Trends: Monitor whether outflows continue or reverse in the coming days, particularly as year-end approaches. ETF Performance: Pay attention to funds like Grayscale Mini BTC and Franklin EZBC, which may attract investors seeking alternatives. Bitcoin Price: Watch for potential impacts on Bitcoin’s price from sustained outflows, as ETF activity often reflects broader sentiment. Diversification is Key Investors should consider diversifying across different funds and asset classes to mitigate risks associated with short-term market shifts. Conclusion The $277.08 million outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 20 signal a period of cautious sentiment among investors. While major funds like ARK Invest, BlackRock, and Fidelity recorded significant losses, smaller funds like Grayscale Mini BTC and Franklin EZBC saw modest inflows, reflecting varying investor strategies. As the market adjusts to these dynamics, investors and analysts will closely monitor the broader implications for Bitcoin and ETF markets. Whether these outflows mark a temporary shift or a larger trend remains to be seen.

Here are the Analyst’s Opinions for the Trump Administration,"The cryptocurrency market also faced a sell-off as investors became wary of riskier assets. While better-than-expected inflation data provided some relief, it was not enough to offset overnight losses. Bitcoin lost nearly 5% and ETH lost over 13% in the past week. Despite the turmoil in the market, optimism about the future of crypto regulation came to the fore at the Blockchain Association’s Policy Summit this week in Washington, D.C. During an interview with CNBC’s Crypto World, Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith outlined her expectations for regulatory priorities that lawmakers could focus on in 2025. Smith expressed the industry’s expectation of a “fresh start” as new leadership takes office in Congress and key regulatory agencies. According to Smith, various leadership roles and acting capacities at agencies like the SEC and CFTC will be crucial to shaping cryptocurrency policy. While the Trump administration’s appointments of Atkins to the SEC and Bezic to the Treasury have generated interest, the industry awaits announcements for other influential roles, such as CFTC leadership. “It’s really refreshing to have someone at the top supporting us,” Smith said, referring to President Trump’s video message to summit attendees expressing his administration’s commitment to fostering innovation in the crypto space. Related News: Deutsche Bank Teaming Up With This Binance-Listed Altcoin To Build Its Own Blockchain Smith pointed to market structure legislation as a top priority for 2025, saying narrowly-scoped rules are needed to provide clarity to the industry. He also called on the SEC and CFTC to leverage their existing authority to clarify which laws apply to specific aspects of crypto markets. Smith said the goal is to “get this to the finish line so people know the rules of the road ahead,” adding that consumer protection and signaling to institutional investors that the U.S. cryptocurrency market is safe and mature are important. Smith addressed the growing discussion around a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. Treasury, a concept that has gained traction among policymakers and market participants. Such a reserve could help address long-term financial challenges and strengthen Bitcoin’s status as a rare and valuable asset. “This could be a unique opportunity for the U.S., considering there are only 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist,” Smith said. Despite the recent market fluctuations, Smith expressed his optimism about the future of the sector and noted the increasing interest from crypto companies looking to return to or grow in the US. *This is not investment advice.

37919103,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112697,1734777320,"Altcoin Season Index Rises to 46, Signaling a Balanced Crypto Market","The Altcoin Season Index, a metric used to gauge the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, climbed to 46 as of December 21, 2024, according to CoinMarketCap (CMC). The one-point increase from the previous day indicates a closely contested market where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin has established dominance. Updated daily, the index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) over a 90-day period. A score of 46 places the market in a neutral state, though it remains on the cusp of what could develop into an Altcoin Season. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index evaluates whether the cryptocurrency market favors altcoins or Bitcoin: Scoring System 1–25: Indicates Bitcoin Season, where Bitcoin significantly outperforms most altcoins. 26–74: A neutral range where the market is evenly balanced. 75–100: Altcoin Season, where at least 75% of top altcoins outperform Bitcoin. This framework helps investors understand the dynamics between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market, offering insights into potential trends and trading opportunities. Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Characteristics Altcoin Dominance: At least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. Market Diversity: Increased interest in projects with unique use cases, such as DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 solutions. Higher Risk Appetite: Investors are more willing to explore speculative assets during this period. Bitcoin Season Characteristics Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s performance surpasses that of most altcoins, often due to its status as a safe-haven asset. Institutional Focus: Bitcoin tends to attract more institutional interest during uncertain or bearish markets. Reduced Market Diversification: Altcoins may lose momentum as traders consolidate holdings into Bitcoin. Current Market Context: What a Score of 46 Means A score of 46 reflects a neutral market state with a slight tilt toward Bitcoin performance. However, this balance suggests potential opportunities in both Bitcoin and altcoins, depending on individual market trends. Key Observations Mixed Performance: While several altcoins have posted impressive gains, others lag behind Bitcoin’s steady performance. Increased Volatility: The competition between altcoins and Bitcoin often leads to heightened price swings across the market. Top Altcoins Leading the Market Despite the neutral index score, some altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin in recent weeks, highlighting their potential: Ethereum (ETH): A cornerstone of DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum continues to attract interest due to its utility and upcoming network upgrades. Polygon (MATIC): Known for its scalability solutions, Polygon has seen increased adoption among developers and projects. Solana (SOL): Despite previous setbacks, Solana’s ecosystem is experiencing renewed growth in decentralized applications. What Investors Should Watch As the Altcoin Season Index fluctuates, investors can consider the following strategies: Monitor the Index: Daily updates provide insights into whether the market is leaning toward Bitcoin or altcoins. Diversify Holdings: A balanced portfolio with both Bitcoin and promising altcoins can help mitigate risks. Research Altcoin Projects: Focus on assets with strong fundamentals, active development, and real-world use cases. Historical Trends and Predictions 2024 Trends The Altcoin Season Index has seen periods of both Bitcoin and altcoin dominance throughout 2024. Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally past $100,000 earlier this year initially shifted the index toward Bitcoin Season, but altcoins have since regained ground. Looking Ahead Analysts predict that regulatory clarity and increasing adoption of blockchain technology could fuel further competition between Bitcoin and altcoins in 2025. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s rise to 46 highlights the ongoing balance between Bitcoin and altcoin performance in the cryptocurrency market. This neutral position offers investors opportunities in both segments, depending on their risk tolerance and market outlook. As the crypto market continues to evolve, staying informed about index trends and individual asset performance will be crucial for navigating potential opportunities.

37919043,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112695,1734777270,"Bitcoin Demand Surges, Building Momentum Amid Tightening Supply","The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a surge in Bitcoin demand, according to blockchain intelligence platform CryptoQuant. Recent data shows that over-the-counter (OTC) desks have experienced their largest monthly inventory drop of the year, with a decrease of 26,000 BTC in December alone. Since November 20, the total balance has fallen by a staggering 40,000 BTC, signaling a tightening supply and growing market momentum. This trend underscores increasing confidence in Bitcoin as an asset, driven by a combination of market dynamics and broader adoption. Tightening Supply: A Key Indicator of Growing Demand The sharp decline in OTC desk inventories is a strong indicator of rising Bitcoin demand. OTC desks facilitate large transactions for institutional and high-net-worth investors, often outside traditional exchanges, making their activity a bellwether for market sentiment. Key Metrics from CryptoQuant 26,000 BTC Monthly Decline: The largest inventory drop of the year for OTC desks occurred in December. 40,000 BTC Total Decline: Since November 20, the total inventory has decreased by 40,000 BTC, reflecting sustained demand. This tightening supply suggests that Bitcoin is being accumulated faster than it can be replenished, creating upward pressure on its price. Drivers Behind the Bitcoin Demand Surge Several factors are contributing to the surge in Bitcoin demand: 1. Institutional Accumulation Institutional investors continue to view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. This sentiment has been reinforced by recent macroeconomic uncertainties and the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. 2. Broader Adoption The adoption of Bitcoin for payments, remittances, and as a treasury reserve asset is driving demand across retail and corporate sectors. 3. Regulatory Developments Anticipation of clearer regulations, particularly in the U.S., is boosting investor confidence, as policymakers aim to integrate cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system. Impact of Tightening Supply on Market Momentum The declining supply of Bitcoin in OTC desks is likely to have significant implications for the market: 1. Price Pressure As demand outpaces supply, Bitcoin’s price is expected to experience upward pressure. Historical trends suggest that similar supply squeezes have often preceded significant price rallies. 2. Increased Volatility Tightening supply can amplify market volatility, especially if demand surges unexpectedly or new investors enter the market. 3. Long-Term Bullish Sentiment Reduced availability of Bitcoin strengthens its narrative as “digital gold,” a scarce asset with intrinsic value, further enhancing its appeal as a long-term investment. Historical Context: Comparing Past Trends Bitcoin has experienced similar periods of tightening supply in the past, often leading to notable market movements: 2020 Pre-Bull Run: A significant drop in Bitcoin balances across exchanges in 2020 preceded the 2021 bull market, during which Bitcoin reached new all-time highs. 2023 Supply Squeeze: Another inventory decline last year coincided with Bitcoin’s recovery from a prolonged bear market. The current trend mirrors these historical patterns, indicating the potential for further price increases. What Investors Should Watch For traders and investors, the ongoing surge in Bitcoin demand offers key insights: Monitor OTC Activity: Continued inventory declines at OTC desks could signal sustained institutional accumulation. Track Price Movements: Tightening supply often correlates with upward price momentum, presenting opportunities for strategic entry points. Stay Informed: Understanding macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and regulatory changes, can help predict market trends. The Broader Crypto Market Impact Bitcoin’s rising demand and tightening supply have ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency market: Altcoin Performance: As Bitcoin dominance grows, altcoins may face short-term pressure but could benefit from increased overall market activity. DeFi and NFTs: Increased interest in Bitcoin often spills over into other blockchain applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Market Confidence: Strong Bitcoin demand can boost confidence in the crypto market, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Conclusion The surge in Bitcoin demand, as highlighted by CryptoQuant’s data, marks a critical moment for the cryptocurrency market. With OTC desk inventories experiencing record declines and supply tightening, Bitcoin is poised for potential price growth and sustained bullish momentum. For investors, understanding the dynamics of supply and demand in the crypto market is crucial for navigating opportunities and risks.

37919006,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112692,1734777216,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index Falls to 73, Staying in the ‘Greed’ Zone","The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a popular measure of market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space, has dipped to 73 as of December 21, 2024, according to Alternative, a software development platform. Despite the one-point drop from the previous day, the index remains in the “Greed” zone, signaling continued optimism, albeit slightly tempered, in the market. This index is a key indicator for traders and investors, as it provides insights into whether the market sentiment leans toward fear or greed, often influencing trading decisions and price volatility. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index The Crypto Fear and Greed Index ranges from 0 to 100, with values closer to 0 indicating extreme fear and those near 100 reflecting extreme greed. The index aims to quantify market sentiment by analyzing various factors: Components of the Index Volatility (25%) Measures recent price volatility and market corrections relative to average values. Higher volatility typically signals fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) Assesses the trading volume and momentum in major cryptocurrencies. Increasing volume and momentum indicate greed. Social Media (15%) Tracks mentions and interactions on platforms like Twitter, analyzing the sentiment of crypto discussions. Surveys (15%) Includes sentiment surveys from investors and traders, gauging collective market opinions. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Evaluates Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Higher dominance often correlates with fear, as investors retreat to the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%) Analyzes search trends for Bitcoin-related terms, reflecting public interest and sentiment. Market Implications of the ‘Greed’ Zone The index’s current position in the “Greed” zone highlights market optimism but also warns of potential risks. What Does a Greed Rating of 73 Indicate? Optimistic Sentiment: Investors are actively engaging in the market, with a focus on growth and profit opportunities. Potential Overheating: Prolonged greed may signal an overheated market, increasing the likelihood of corrections. Historical Context Periods of extreme greed often precede market corrections, as overconfidence can lead to unsustainable price levels. Conversely, extreme fear has historically created buying opportunities. Factors Influencing the Current Sentiment Several factors have contributed to the current sentiment captured by the index: 1. Bitcoin and Market Momentum Bitcoin’s recent rally, which saw its price stabilize above $100,000, has been a significant driver of greed in the market. Traders view this as a sign of long-term bullish sentiment. 2. Altcoin Performance Altcoins have also experienced significant price gains, adding to the overall optimism. Projects with strong fundamentals and innovative use cases have garnered attention. 3. Regulatory Developments Anticipation of regulatory clarity, particularly in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump, has bolstered investor confidence. What Traders and Investors Should Watch While the “Greed” zone indicates positive sentiment, it also comes with cautionary signals: Market Corrections: A high greed level could precede a pullback, as investors take profits or market enthusiasm wanes. Diversification: Investors should avoid overexposure to volatile assets and diversify their portfolios to mitigate risks. Monitoring Sentiment Changes: Tracking the index for sudden shifts toward fear can help anticipate market trends. Crypto Fear and Greed Index Trends in 2024 Year-to-Date Highlights Early 2024: The index frequently oscillated between “Neutral” and “Greed” as the market stabilized after 2023’s bear market. Mid-2024 Rally: Bitcoin’s surge past $100,000 pushed the index into “Extreme Greed,” reflecting euphoria. Current Phase: The index has moderated but remains in the “Greed” zone, signaling sustained market confidence. Potential Future Scenarios Continued Greed: Positive market developments could push the index higher, increasing the risk of a correction. Shift to Fear: Negative news or significant price corrections could quickly move the index into fear territory, creating buying opportunities. Conclusion The Crypto Fear and Greed Index’s current value of 73 reflects a market dominated by optimism, though slightly tempered compared to previous highs. While this sentiment suggests confidence among traders and investors, it also serves as a reminder of the potential for market corrections.

Trading at $98,466, Bitcoin shows a 4.30% recovery in the last 24 hours, driven by renewed investor interest and higher trading volumes. This upward movement reflects a strong buy-in sentiment, as the cryptocurrency eyes the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin’s Technical Outlook: Resistance at $99,500 Bitcoin faces a key resistance level at $99,500, a point where a downward trendline intersects with recent price activity. The formation of a tweezers top pattern on the 2-hour chart further adds to selling pressure at this level. A breakout above $99,500 could signal the beginning of a bullish continuation, targeting the next critical resistance levels at $102,650 and potentially $105,400. On the downside, Bitcoin finds support at $95,675, with further safety nets at $92,230 and $89,850. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $97,800 provides nearby technical support, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 50 indicates neutral market conditions. This balance suggests the market is at a tipping point, with a breakout or rejection at $99,460 likely to determine its next direction. Bitcoin Dominance Surges: End of Altcoin Season? The attached chart underscores Bitcoin’s rising dominance, as altcoins lose ground amidst waning investor confidence. Altcoin season, represented by declining Bitcoin dominance earlier this year, seems to have ended as BTC regains market traction. The blue curve representing Bitcoin dominance has steadily climbed, aligning with a price recovery, while the red altcoin dominance line falters. A tweet by @Negentropic_ encapsulates the sentiment: “Is This the End of Altcoin Season? Bitcoin dominance surges, leaving altcoins lagging. A BTC breakout could change the game.” Is This the End of Altcoin Season? Bitcoin dominance is surging after dipping below $100K, while altcoins are losing critical supports.

For altcoins to regain momentum, Bitcoin would need to stabilize above $100,000, creating space for parallel growth in the market. What This Means for Investors Bitcoin’s price action at $99,460 is a make-or-break moment. A breakout above this key resistance could trigger a renewed rally, targeting $102,650 and beyond. However, failure to clear this level might lead to consolidation or a retest of the $95,675 support. Bitcoin's Key Resistance at $99,460! BTC eyes a breakout as it tests a critical trendline.

37919005,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112689,1734777160,Michael Saylor Proposes Bitcoin Reserve to Reduce U.S. National Debt,"Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy and a staunch Bitcoin advocate, has unveiled a groundbreaking plan to address the U.S. national debt through a strategic Bitcoin reserve. His “Digital Assets Framework,” aligned with President-elect Donald Trump’s economic vision, outlines how Bitcoin adoption, clear regulations, and a robust $10 trillion stablecoin market could transform the U.S. economy. According to Saylor, a national Bitcoin reserve could potentially generate $81 trillion, eliminating the national debt and establishing the U.S. as a global leader in the digital economy. Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset Saylor’s proposal positions Bitcoin as a cornerstone of U.S. fiscal policy, leveraging its unique properties as a decentralized, scarce, and universally recognized digital asset. Why Bitcoin? Scarcity and Value: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a deflationary asset, ideal for preserving value over time. Global Liquidity: Bitcoin is traded 24/7 worldwide, offering unmatched liquidity compared to traditional assets. Digital Gold: Like gold, Bitcoin is seen as a store of value, but its digital nature offers greater accessibility and utility. Key Components of Saylor’s Digital Assets Framework Saylor’s framework is built on three core pillars designed to modernize the U.S. economy and fiscal policy: 1. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Revenue Generation: A national Bitcoin reserve could generate significant returns through appreciation and adoption, with projections of up to $81 trillion. Debt Reduction: Earnings from the reserve could be directed toward eliminating the U.S. national debt, which exceeds $33 trillion. Economic Stability: Bitcoin reserves could act as a hedge against inflation and global economic uncertainty. 2. Clear Crypto Regulations Universal Taxonomy: Saylor advocates for standardized classifications of digital assets to create a transparent regulatory environment. Investor Confidence: Clear rules would encourage institutional and retail participation in the crypto market. Innovation Hub: Regulatory clarity could position the U.S. as a global leader in blockchain and digital finance. 3. $10 Trillion Stablecoin Market Boosting Treasury Demand: Stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar could increase global demand for U.S. Treasury securities. Payment Innovations: Stablecoins could modernize payment systems, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. Strengthening the Dollar: A thriving stablecoin market would reinforce the U.S. dollar’s position as the global reserve currency. Alignment with Trump’s Economic Vision President-elect Donald Trump has hinted at a pro-crypto stance, emphasizing innovation and growth. Saylor’s framework complements Trump’s proposal by integrating Bitcoin into the national economic strategy. Benefits of Bitcoin Adoption for the U.S. Global Leadership: A national Bitcoin reserve would cement the U.S. as a leader in the digital economy. Economic Growth: Blockchain innovation and Bitcoin adoption could drive job creation and investment. Geopolitical Influence: Controlling a significant share of the global Bitcoin supply would enhance U.S. geopolitical leverage. Potential Challenges and Criticisms While Saylor’s proposal is ambitious, it faces several hurdles: Regulatory Resistance: Critics may argue that Bitcoin’s volatility and decentralized nature make it unsuitable for national reserves. Implementation Complexity: Establishing and managing a Bitcoin reserve would require significant infrastructure and expertise. Market Risks: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations could pose risks to fiscal stability. The Role of Stablecoins in Economic Transformation Saylor’s emphasis on a $10 trillion stablecoin market highlights the potential of blockchain-based digital currencies to modernize the U.S. financial system. Advantages of Stablecoins Enhanced Liquidity: Stablecoins facilitate instant, low-cost transactions, boosting market efficiency. Global Reach: As digital representations of the U.S. dollar, stablecoins can extend the dollar’s influence worldwide. Public and Private Collaboration: A robust stablecoin market could emerge from partnerships between private issuers and regulatory bodies. Can Bitcoin Solve the U.S. Debt Crisis? Saylor’s proposal to leverage Bitcoin as a solution to the U.S. debt crisis is unprecedented. By tapping into Bitcoin’s appreciation potential and integrating it with traditional economic frameworks, the U.S. could unlock new avenues for fiscal recovery. However, success depends on several factors: Market Conditions: Sustained Bitcoin adoption and price growth are essential for generating the projected $81 trillion. Policy Alignment: Political will and bipartisan support are crucial for implementing such a transformative strategy. Public Perception: Gaining public trust in Bitcoin as a reserve asset is necessary for widespread acceptance. Conclusion Michael Saylor’s proposal to use Bitcoin reserves to eliminate the U.S. national debt represents a bold vision for the future of finance. By aligning with President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-innovation agenda, Saylor’s framework aims to position the U.S. as a global leader in the digital economy. While challenges remain, the potential benefits—ranging from fiscal recovery to enhanced economic influence—underscore the transformative power of integrating Bitcoin into national policy. Whether this proposal becomes reality depends on the willingness of policymakers, regulators, and the public to embrace Bitcoin’s potential.

37919004,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112687,1734777106,Tether (USDT) Faces Delisting on EU Exchanges Ahead of MiCA Deadline,"European cryptocurrency exchanges are preparing to delist Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin, by December 30, 2024. The move comes as exchanges work to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations. While Tether is developing MiCA-compliant alternatives, the decision has raised concerns about liquidity and market stability in the region, which already struggles to compete with the thriving U.S. crypto market. MiCA Regulations and Their Impact on Stablecoins The MiCA framework, set to take effect in 2024, establishes stringent regulatory requirements for crypto assets, including stablecoins like USDT. Why Is Tether Being Delisted? Non-Compliance: USDT currently does not meet MiCA’s requirements for transparency, asset backing, and regulatory reporting. Regulatory Deadline: Exchanges face pressure to delist non-compliant tokens before the December 30 deadline to avoid penalties. MiCA’s Objectives Investor Protection: Ensuring transparency and minimizing risks associated with stablecoins. Market Integrity: Regulating stablecoin issuers to maintain financial stability. Innovation Support: Promoting compliant crypto assets while reducing systemic risks. Tether’s Dominance and Market Concerns Tether’s delisting is a significant development, given its status as the most widely-used stablecoin globally. In Europe, USDT is integral to crypto trading pairs, cross-border transactions, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Impact on Liquidity Reduced Trading Options: Tether’s removal could disrupt trading pairs on major EU exchanges. Market Volatility: A sudden shift in liquidity may increase price fluctuations for other assets. Zodia Markets CEO Speaks Out Usman Ahmad, CEO of Zodia Markets, described USDT as “critical” for the EU crypto ecosystem, warning that its delisting could hinder investments and innovation in the region. Tether’s Response to MiCA Tether is actively working to address MiCA compliance issues and regain its position in the EU market. MiCA-Compliant Alternatives New Stablecoins: Tether is reportedly developing alternatives that meet EU standards, including enhanced asset backing and reporting mechanisms. Timeline Uncertainty: While alternatives are in the pipeline, the exact timeline for their release remains unclear, leaving a temporary gap in the market. Global Perspective While Tether adjusts to EU regulations, its dominance remains largely unchallenged in other regions, including the U.S. and Asia. Opportunities for Competitors The delisting creates an opening for Tether’s competitors to gain market share in Europe. Emerging Players Circle’s USD Coin (USDC): USDC is already MiCA-compliant and stands to benefit from increased adoption. EU-Specific Stablecoins: Regional stablecoins backed by the euro, such as Stasis EURS, may see a surge in demand. Challenges for Competitors While competitors may fill the gap left by Tether, they must ensure scalability and liquidity to handle the increased demand. Impact on the EU Crypto Market The timing of the delisting poses challenges for the EU market: Market Disruption: The removal of a dominant stablecoin like USDT could create temporary instability. Investor Sentiment: Uncertainty around stablecoin availability may deter institutional and retail investors. Lagging Behind Global Markets: As the U.S. and Asia continue to thrive in crypto adoption, Europe risks falling further behind. The Road Ahead for EU Crypto Regulation MiCA represents a landmark moment for crypto regulation, but its implementation has raised questions about balancing compliance with market growth. Key Considerations Investor Protections vs. Innovation: Striking a balance between safeguarding investors and fostering innovation is critical. Regional Competitiveness: Ensuring the EU remains attractive for crypto businesses and investments is essential for its long-term success. Conclusion The delisting of Tether (USDT) from EU exchanges highlights the transformative impact of the MiCA regulatory framework on the region’s crypto market. While the move aims to ensure compliance and market integrity, it raises concerns about liquidity, market stability, and Europe’s competitiveness in the global crypto landscape. As Tether works on MiCA-compliant alternatives and competitors seize the opportunity to expand their footprint, the EU market faces a critical transition period. How this unfolds will shape the future of cryptocurrency adoption and innovation in the region.

37919089,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631412,1734777059,David Sacks loses White House AI and Crypto Czar role in Trump administration,"David Sacks, the venture capitalist with Silicon Valley clout and a close ally of Elon Musk, has already found himself sidelined in Washington before Donald Trump’s second term officially begins. Sacks, initially introduced as the incoming administration’s “AI and Crypto Czar,” will reportedly no longer lead the newly established Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Instead, his role has been cut down to a mere advisory position, raising questions about his influence in Trump’s ambitious tech agenda. The report says his refusal to fully divest from his investment firm, Craft Ventures, and his insistence on maintaining his private-sector ties have seriously complicated things. “They realized they needed someone who could run operations full-time,” one insider said. The rise of Kratsios: Filling the operational void That someone is Michael Kratsios, Trump’s former Chief Technology Officer, who is stepping in to lead the administration’s tech efforts. His prior experience during Trump’s first administration makes him a natural choice to manage the daily grind of tech operations, from AI policy to telecom regulations. Assisting him is Gale Slater, another key figure in the administration, focusing on telecom and antitrust issues. Sacks’ new role falls under the category of “special government employee,” a designation that allows him to continue managing Craft Ventures while advising the administration. This setup avoids the formalities of Senate confirmation but raises ethical concerns. “Not divesting makes this messy,” a source close to the situation said. “Even in an administration that treats conflicts of interest casually, this became a problem.” Despite the reduction in responsibilities, Sacks still enjoys proximity to power. He’s been frequently seen at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate and Capitol Hill, where he’s met with legislators like Rand Paul. But the excitement that initially surrounded Sacks’ appointment has now moved to Kratsios and his operational capabilities. “Everyone wanted to meet Sacks,” an insider allegedly said. “Now they want to know what Kratsios can deliver.” Tech billionaires, profits, and politics The Silicon Valley boys are all over Trump’s cabinet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk will co-lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) with former pharma executive Vivek Ramaswamy . But Sacks doesn’t have Elon’s household name recognition. While he co-hosts a popular VC-focused podcast and boasts a $3 billion portfolio at Craft Ventures, his profile outside the tech bubble is far lower. Geopolitics adds to the complexity. Sacks has long warned about China’s advancements in AI and tech, arguing that the U.S. must stay ahead. His stance aligns with Trump’s deregulatory push but raises questions about export controls, chip manufacturing, and the storage of sensitive AI data. Sacks has also clashed with Big Tech over their operations in China , criticizing companies like Alphabet and Meta for adhering to China’s strict rules while reaping benefits from U.S. markets. “In the long term, Big Tech will have to pick a side,” Sacks said in a 2021 statement. His call for a “decoupling” between U.S. and Chinese tech markets resonates with some folks but alienates others wary of economic fallout. Sacks’ tenure at Twitter, following Musk’s chaotic acquisition, provides a glimpse into his management style. Known for abrupt meetings and a no-nonsense approach, Sacks often clashed with employees. “He didn’t understand how the platform worked,” one former Twitter employee said. “It was a disaster.” During his time at Twitter, he focused on new revenue streams, like subscriptions and payments, but his lack of familiarity with existing models frustrated staff. “He had no clue about LinkedIn Premium or YouTube Plus,” one source reportedly said. His role in releasing the controversial “Twitter Files” further polarized opinions, as critics accused him of prioritizing ideology over functionality.

Conclusion Tether’s planned AI platform launch by Q1 2025 marks a bold step into the future of blockchain and technology. As a pioneer in the stablecoin market, Tether’s embrace of AI demonstrates its commitment to innovation and its vision to expand the utility of digital assets. While challenges remain, the potential applications of this platform could redefine the intersection of AI and blockchain, creating new opportunities for Tether and its ecosystem.

37918917,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666149,1734777017,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bleed: 6,700 BTC Exit Amidst Largest Outflow In Months","Amid a wider readjusting of market expectations for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) for 2025, investors withdrew a record $680 million from Bitcoin ETFs on Thursday, the highest outflow in a single day since January’s approval of these investment funds. Grayscale And Bitwise Bitcoin ETFs Experience 8% Decline As Bitcoin ETFs faced this outflow, the price declined, dropping another 5% to trade around $97,400 to close the week. The sell-off aligns with a general downturn in risk assets, triggered by the Fed’s updated economic projections released earlier this week. The US central bank now anticipates only two quarter-point rate cuts in the coming year, a significant reduction from the four cuts previously expected at its September meeting. Related Reading: How Low Can Dogecoin Go Before It Rebounds? Expert Forecasts Notable Bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust and Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF, have experienced declines of approximately 8% since the Fed’s new guidance, while Bitcoin itself has lost about 9% in the same timeframe. Notably, Thursday’s outflows broke a streak of 15 consecutive days of inflows for the twelve US Bitcoin ETFs, for a net inflow of approximately $5.3 billion during this period. After hitting a record high of just over $108,000 earlier in this week, the market’s top cryptocurrency dropped below the $100,000 level on Thursday. Prior to the recent recovery, which is just around $100,000, it fell all the way to $92,000. While the bearish sentiment in the markets can be attributed to the Fed’s cautious stance, it is also likely influenced by seasonal profit-taking among institutional investors of the Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts Warn Of Continued Crypto Sell-Off The recent selling pressure could further strain market sentiment, as noted by Joseph Dahrieh, managing principal at Tickmill. “This decline could weigh strongly on the cryptocurrency and broader market sentiment, particularly as Bitcoin fell below the USD 100,000 mark, indicating potential short-term volatility and downside risks,” he remarked. The volatility has been exacerbated by massive liquidations in both long and short positions, totaling over $240 million within a 24-hour period. Antonio Di Giacomo, a senior market analyst at XS.com, commented, “The Federal Reserve’s cautious stance in signaling fewer cuts for 2025 created an atmosphere of doubt and speculation.” Related Reading: Ethereum Investment: Trump Crypto Project Grabs 722 ETH At $2.5 Million Looking ahead, the sell-off in the cryptocurrency market may persist in the near term. Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, speculated that the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies could drop below $3 trillion, down from a peak of $3.7 trillion earlier this month. He cautioned that “a failure below $94,500 would signal a break of the uptrend of the last six weeks, while a fall below $92,000 would bring the price under the 50-day moving average. In this case, time is playing on the side of the bears.” As of this writing, Bitcoin has managed to stabilize above $97,400 as the week draws to a close, despite registering 4% losses over the previous 24 hours.

In contrast, Filecoin and Cosmos each offer unique benefits—Filecoin with its decentralised storage solutions and Cosmos with its robust blockchain interoperability—but they each have their limitations. Let’s explore how Qubetics, in particular, is tackling the real-life issues that blockchain users face today. Qubetics: Tackling the Security Issues with its Non-Custodial Wallet As blockchain technology continues to evolve, one of the most glaring issues that users face is the lack of security and control over their assets. A custodial wallet, while convenient, places your funds under the control of a third party, leaving you exposed to various risks such as hacks, regulatory complications, and even the loss of access to your funds. This dependency on external entities not only undermines the core value of decentralisation but also poses significant privacy concerns. Qubetics is changing the game with its non-custodial wallet. With this wallet, users have full control over their digital assets, ensuring they are not reliant on third parties. This reduces the risk of hacks and theft, which have been major issues in the crypto space. Additionally, non-custodial wallets come with the added benefit of enhanced privacy—because you don’t need to share your personal information with a third party, the risk of data leaks and surveillance is significantly reduced. It’s a game-changer for anyone who values control, security, and privacy in the blockchain space. But that’s not all. Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the best altcoins to invest in for short term growth , thanks to its presale success and the promise of huge returns post-mainnet launch. With over 363 million $TICS tokens sold and over 10,900 token holders, Qubetics is gaining momentum quickly. The analysts’ price prediction of $10 to $15 per $TICS token after the mainnet launch only adds to the excitement. At the current price of $0.0342, investing in Qubetics now could yield incredible returns in the near future. By addressing key problems in blockchain security and user control, Qubetics is paving the way for a more decentralised and secure crypto future. This makes it one of the best altcoins to invest in for short term, as it not only promises high returns but also solves a pressing issue that impacts all blockchain users.

Filecoin: The Future of Decentralised Data Storage In the world of blockchain, decentralisation is key, and Filecoin has made its mark as a pioneer in decentralised data storage. As we become more reliant on digital storage, traditional cloud services are facing mounting challenges around privacy, security, and data control. Filecoin steps in to solve these issues by providing a decentralised solution that ensures data is stored securely across a distributed network. Filecoin’s model allows individuals to rent out unused storage space, creating a more efficient and secure system for storing data. This peer-to-peer network removes the need for centralised entities that can impose restrictions or be susceptible to data breaches. The platform’s rapid growth is a testament to the increasing demand for decentralised storage solutions. As Filecoin continues to climb, it’s positioned as one of the best altcoins to invest in for short term. Analysts are predicting strong price action, especially with the growing adoption of decentralized data storage. With more enterprises looking to decentralise their storage solutions, Filecoin is well on its way to becoming a significant player in the blockchain ecosystem. Cosmos: Interoperability Takes Blockchain to the Next Level Interoperability is one of the most important features that the blockchain space is working towards, and Cosmos is at the forefront of this revolution. Cosmos aims to create an Internet of Blockchains by making it easier for different blockchain networks to communicate with each other. This breakthrough solution addresses a fundamental problem in the crypto world: how to enable seamless communication between different blockchains that often operate in isolation. Cosmos is building a network that facilitates the exchange of data and value across different blockchains, ensuring a more interconnected and efficient ecosystem. The potential of Cosmos to unlock true scalability and interconnectivity could reshape the entire blockchain landscape. Its innovative approach makes it one of the best altcoins to invest in for short term, as analysts are predicting strong price growth due to increasing demand for interoperability solutions. As blockchain technology matures, the need for interoperability will only grow, and Cosmos is positioning itself as a key player in this area. For investors looking to capitalize on the blockchain’s future, Cosmos presents a solid short-term investment opportunity. The Final Word So, let’s break it down. All three of these projects—Qubetics, Filecoin, and Cosmos—offer something unique to the crypto space, and each one addresses a real-world problem. Qubetics is stepping up with its non-custodial wallet, providing a solution for those tired of worrying about third-party control and security risks. Filecoin is revolutionising data storage with its decentralised approach, while Cosmos is making interoperability between blockchains a reality. However, when it comes to the best altcoins to invest in for short term , Qubetics stands out. With its presale success, its promise of solving a crucial issue in blockchain security, and the high growth potential of its $TICS token, Qubetics is one to watch. If you’re looking for a short-term investment that offers not only a secure future but also incredible returns, Qubetics could be your best bet. As the price of Qubetics continues to rise and the mainnet launch nears, the potential for gains is undeniable. While Filecoin and Cosmos are strong contenders, Qubetics’ focus on solving real-life problems and offering a decentralised wallet with full user control makes it an exciting project in the short term. While Filecoin and Cosmos have their merits, Qubetics provides a unique solution that could transform the blockchain space for the better. So, if you’re looking for a short-term investment that holds real promise, Qubetics should be at the top of your list. Get in early and enjoy the ride as the project continues to grow and revolutionise the crypto world.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 234,800 followers on the social media platform X that the crypto market may experience wild price swings to close out December. However, the analyst predicts markets may rally in January based on historical precedence. “We probably get one-plus more flushes before the year’s end, but keep your eye on the prize and manage yourself through the volatility. January is historically a great month for crypto. In my opinion, sell bags you don’t like as much for cash and save that to deploy on bags you do like.” The analyst also says that some crypto projects are showing strength amid the broad market sell-off such as decentralized finance protocol Usual ( USUAL ). “One note on the USUAL chart: if you see a coin standing out above the rest amidst insane market volatility, it’s usually a sign that this is a very good coin. This one didn’t budge when everything was down 20%. I added more on this dip and will add even more if it goes further… I bought anywhere from like $1.08-$1.20 and I’ll continue adding. This one is a winner in my opinion. Hits a bunch of narratives, and I think that this one still outperforms a bunch of others.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X USUAL is trading for $1.25 at time of writing, down over 13% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst suggests that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may soon hit a local market bottom after collapsing below $100,000 this week. “We’re getting close. I think that BTC should be finding a relative bottom very shortly, expecting a bit more downside and then some sort of reversal. Not sure if this is ‘the’ bottom but yeah, let’s see.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Looking at his chart, the trader suggests that Bitcoin could decline to $90,911 on the four-hour chart before reversing. Bitcoin is trading for $97,325 at time of writing, a fractional increase in the last 24 hours.

37918249,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395981,1734775597,"Ethereum Price Analysis: Here’s Why ETH Can’t Break the $4,000 Barrier","The post Ethereum Price Analysis: Here’s Why ETH Can’t Break the $4,000 Barrier appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH) has been stuck below the $4,000 mark for months, repeatedly hitting a wall every time it gets close. Despite occasional bounces, the cryptocurrency has failed to break through this level since March 2024. Currently sitting at $3,475, it has dropped 24% in the past few days. So, what’s behind Ethereum’s struggle? Why Can’t Ethereum Break the $4,000 Wall? For Ethereum, $4,000 has become a major hurdle. Each time ETH approaches this level, the price falls back. Recently, ETH dropped to $3,097, but it has managed to recover to $3,475. However, the market still looks weak, with trading volume dropping by nearly 15%, showing traders aren’t very interested right now. The relative strength index (RSI) is at 52.64, meaning the market is neutral, but there’s little movement. While the 20-day moving average is helping to keep ETH above $3,400, breaking through $4,000 remains a challenge. Source : Tradingview ETFs Aren’t Helping Ethereum’s Case When Ethereum launched its spot ETFs in August, expectations were high. Unfortunately, they haven’t had the impact many anticipated. The U.S. spot ETH ETFs now hold about $11.98 billion, which is small compared to Bitcoin’s $109.66 billion in ETFs. Just yesterday, $60 million was pulled from ETH ETFs, marking the biggest outflow since mid-November. On top of that, social sentiment around Ethereum is at its lowest in a year. However, such lows sometimes signal that ETH could bounce back soon. Ethereum price fluctuations are making waves—want to know where it’s headed? Read Ethereum price prediction for the latest insights! Troubles in the Futures Market Things aren’t looking good in the futures market either. Ethereum futures are showing a negative premium for the first time since early November, which is a worrying sign for traders. Adding to the concern, a huge $299 million sell-off occurred yesterday, the largest since December 9. To make matters worse, the Ethereum Foundation sold 100 ETH on December 17, which has raised further doubts, as sell-offs near local highs often signal trouble. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Global Financial Crisis Ahead?

Some believe sentiment could turn positive and push ETH higher, while others remain cautious due to the high supply of ETH and the growing preference for Bitcoin among investors. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Experts say the first one is DTX Exchange (DTX). This new crypto has the best growth potential right now. It’s set to bring at least 50x profits in 2025. Next is SUI. Sui is a great project that is continually improving. As such, experts see it as a great investment. Lastly, we have TRON (TRX). TRON is also expected to bring big profits by next year. Read on as we cover more about these coins! SUI’s Price is Dropping: Should You Buy the Dip? SUI’s price is decreasing right now. This is mainly due to SUI investors taking some profits. So, experts aren’t worried about SUI’s future right now. They also say that now is a great time to invest in SUI. They say that SUI will continue to rise in the future. Sui has already started integrating with USDC recently. This will boost Sui’s flexibility. It will also give Sui users better trading opportunities. With this in mind, experts see SUI’s demand increasing in 2025. In turn, they also see the token price rising. So, they see SUI as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now. They see SUI’s price increasing by at least 2x in Q1 of 2025! Is TRX’s Price Decrease Something to Worry About? TRX’s price is also down right now. However, the TON coin price dip is a bit more intense than that of other coins. Experts say that this is due to many TRON investors taking profits. It’s also because interest in TRON isn’t very high right now. Luckily, experts say that things will turn around for TRON soon. They say that activity on TRON is down because the market has entered a bearish phase. That’s why TRON isn’t dealing with many transactions at this time. With that in mind, they expect things to pick up after the holidays. They see more people buying TRX tokens to invest in projects. They also see more people using TRON for transfers. Because of this, they see TRX’s price rising by at least 2x in 2025. So, this TRX price dip is a good buying opportunity. Also, TRX is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now! DTX Exchange: Innovation, Diversification, and Simplicity at Their Finest Out of the three best cryptocurrencies to buy on this list, DTX Exchange takes the lead. That’s because DTX Exchange brings massive innovation and utility. Namely, it is a new trading platform that makes trading much easier! Traders can trade anything they want from one place. You can trade much more than crypto with DXT Exchange. Also, you can keep all your assets in one very secure wallet. The wallet in question is DTX Exchange’s Phoenix Wallet. It supports over 10,000 assets and keeps them safe in one place. So, trading and managing assets will be much easier for you! Again, you can trade many different assets with DTX Exchange. And you can do so with massive 1,000x leverage. So you’ll be able to diversify your portfolio. You’ll also take advantage of everything the trading industry has to offer. Furthermore, you’ll be able to turn small trades into huge returns! Another feature that makes DTX Exchange stand out is its speed. Namely, it uses the VulcanX blockchain to give you 100,000 TPS. This is massive, as even Solana’s max speed is at 600 TPS. Also, DTX Exchange gives everyone an equal chance to invest. Unlike other launches, DTX Exchange isn’t supported by whales or VCs. So, there are no large investors that invested before you did. This means that they can’t manipulate the DTX token price. Additionally, DTX Exchange has an impressive incremental price system. This allows DTX’s price to increase steadily over time! DTX: Invest in One of the Best Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now and Watch It Rise 50x in Value! The perks and innovations that DTX Exchange offers are huge. So, it’s no wonder that DTX is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now! Currently, you can invest in this promising token during its public presale. This allows you to take advantage of all the gains DTX will bring after launch. Right now, DTX is available at $0.12 in Stage 6 of its public presale. However, this price won’t be here for long. The presale has been selling out very fast. So, experts say that DTX will launch much sooner than expected. DTX is all set to launch at $0.20, after which its rally will start. They say that DTX’s price will rise by 50x during this rally. They foresee DTX pumping 50x by as early as January 2025. Even after that, DTX has the momentum it needs to continue the ascent, bringing massive profits to its investors!

The altcoins are also in the green following the market-wide crash, with many recovering by double-digit increases on a daily scale. BTC Begins Recovery Mode The business week began in a highly positive manner for the primary cryptocurrency, as its price surged from around $101,000 to over $108,000 by Tuesday to mark its latest all-time high. While the community was expected to rise toward $110,000, especially after Wednesday’s rate cut in the US, the landscape took a sharp turn. Instead of heading further north, BTC actually started to retrace hard. It first lost the $100,000 mark, but that was just the start, as the bears kept the pressure on. The culmination came on Friday when the cryptocurrency plummeted to a three-week low of $92,000, and the conversation turned to whether this was a normal correction or the end of the bull market. So far, though, it seems to be the former. Bitcoin stopped the freefall and bounced off rather impressively. Just earlier today, its price surged past $99,000 before calming to its current level of around $98,500. Its market capitalization has recovered to $1.950 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands at 54.6% on CG. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 21.12.2024. Source: TradingView Altcoins Finally See Green The alternative coins suffered even more than BTC during the market-wide crash, as expected. However, they have turned green now on a daily scale after the Friday massacre. ETH dumped to $3,300 but now sits close to $3,500 after a 6% daily increase. XRP is back above $2.3 after plummeting to under $2 on Friday. BNB, SOL, TRX, and HBAR have gained around 5-6% each since yesterday. More impressive price increases come from the likes of DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, TON, DOT, and many others, all of which have jumped by double digits. The total crypto market cap slumped below $3.4 trillion yesterday but has risen to over $3.550 trillion now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The message is coming after a $490 million lawsuit filed against creators of the $HAWK meme coin. Welch has said she is focused on clearing her name and rebuilding her career. The controversy resulted from the meme coin’s staggering crash, leading to a lawsuit in which plaintiffs alleged improper asset registration. At the time, Welch was involved with the token, doing a series of promotions for the $HAWK meme coin. However, the lawsuit did not include the Hawk Tuah girl as one of the defendants, listing OverHere Ltd and its founder Clinton So, Tuah The Moon Foundation, and influencer Alex Larson Schultz. Hawk Tuah girl plans to rebuild her career In the filing, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants illegally listed the token without prior registration. This means that they knowingly put investors and the general public in harm by not vetting the token through the proper channels. However, a source close to Welch has disclosed that she is upbeat about getting her life back on track. “Hailey understands how her unexpected start in the industry comes across, but since achieving virality, she’s proven she has the star power to lead a successful career,” the source said. I take this situation extremely seriously and want to address my fans, the investors who have been affected, and the broader community. I am fully cooperating with and am committed to assisting the legal team representing the individuals impacted, as well as to help uncover the… — Haliey Welch (@HalieyWelchX) December 20, 2024 In her post on X, Welch noted that she took the issues seriously, saying addressing fans and the general public is the right thing to do. “I take this situation extremely seriously and want to address my fans, the investors who have been affected, and the broader community,” she said. She also added that she is offering help to those affected to uncover the truth, which would help her rebuild her reputation. Welch also provided a link to a form that investors affected by the crash can fill. The link leads to the website of Burwick Law, a crypto litigator representing all the parties suing the creators of the meme coin. According to the source, Welch played a limited role in the creation and promotion of the memecoin. She was paid to endorse and speak about the token because of her social media status and persona. The crypto community reacts to Welch’s statement According to the lawsuit, the $HAWK meme coin climbed high, with its market cap hitting $490 million. However, trouble started after the token lost 90% of its total value four hours later. The plaintiffs also alleged that the group raised $2.8 million in a presale, which took its valuation to $16 million. The plaintiffs want $150,000 in damages, noting that the coin was illegally promoted with its creators making little effort to restrict its sale outside the United States. However, the crypto community did not take the statement lying down, as most people took to their handles to show how they felt. For most of them, it was a case of ‘I told you so’, after several warnings. Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT shared a screenshot where a user was warning the community about an upcoming Hawk Tuah girl meme coin. “Only if you were warned by the entire community before launching the token,” he added. Other crypto community members also showed their displeasure, especially at traders who thought it would be a good idea to purchase the token. One user mentioned that Welch deserved the same treatment as the creators, noting that she promoted it and was involved in it. He said she was just trying to distance herself because the token crashed. Although Welch has tried to distance herself from the scheme since it crashed, the community members are not convinced.

37918578,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321722,1734774734,Google to Require UK Crypto Ads to Register with Financial Regulator Starting January 2025,"Google has announced a policy update requiring advertisements for digital asset exchanges and wallets in the United Kingdom to register with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) before being allowed to run on its platform. The new policy will take effect on January 15, 2025, the search engine company said in a recent announcement. Under the updated rules, advertisers offering crypto exchange services or software wallets in the UK must meet specific conditions to promote their products. UK Crypto Firms Need to Register with FCA Chief among these is registration with the FCA, ensuring compliance with the country’s financial regulations. Additionally, Google will permit advertisements for hardware wallets that store cryptocurrency private keys, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or other digital assets. However, these hardware wallet providers must avoid offering ancillary services such as buying, selling, or trading digital assets. While the search giant did not provide additional requirements for hardware wallet ads, it emphasized that all advertisers must adhere to local laws in their targeted regions. “As a reminder, we expect all advertisers to comply with the local laws for any area that their ads target. This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these financial products,” Google said. #Google announced that starting January 15, advertisers offering #Crypto exchanges targeting the UK may advertise if they meet certain requirements certified by a third-party pic.twitter.com/B9Mo6HQMTS — Crypto with Ankit (@Cryptowithankit) December 21, 2024 The new policy underscores the growing scrutiny of crypto-related advertisements worldwide as regulators attempt to curb misleading promotions. In the UK, the FCA recently issued a warning about the Solana-based memecoin and NFT project “Retardio.” The regulator flagged the project for unauthorized promotions targeting UK consumers, cautioning that investors might face financial losses if the company fails. Elsewhere, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also introduced stricter advertising guidelines for crypto products. The SEC now requires virtual asset service providers and influencers to secure agency approval before publishing promotional materials. Google Ads Promotes Fake Crypto Websites As reported, a sponsored Google ad posing as a link to Sony’s blockchain project, Soneium, was exposed as a cleverly disguised crypto wallet drainer. In October, a search for “soneium” on Google led users to a phishing site designed to steal crypto assets. The ad linked to a website with a domain name similar to Soneium’s official site, which appeared as a legitimate yet unfinished landing page for a radiology service based in the UK. In another incident, a fraudulent cryptocurrency wallet app on Google Play reportedly stole $70,000 from users in a sophisticated scam that has been described as a world-first for targeting mobile users exclusively. The malicious app, named WalletConnect, mimicked the reputable WalletConnect protocol but was, in fact, a sophisticated scheme to drain crypto wallets. The deceptive app managed to deceive over 10,000 users into downloading it, according to Check Point Research (CPR), the cybersecurity firm that uncovered the scam. The scammers behind the app were well aware of the typical challenges faced by web3 users, such as compatibility issues and the lack of widespread support for WalletConnect across different wallets.

37927454,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106067,1734773804,"Expert Explains Why You Need to Hold at Least 1,000 XRP","Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, recently shared compelling insights on the significance of holding at least 1,000 XRP for long-term success. In a video update , Farina emphasized that XRP’s utility and adoption potential make it a cornerstone of the ongoing financial transformation. In parallel, he urged investors to secure their holdings before prices escalate.The Case for 1,000 XRPFarina believes 1,000 XRP is a critical benchmark for investors aiming to capitalize on the ""greatest transfer of wealth in history."" While this amount currently costs around $2,300, Farina argues that its long-term value could grow exponentially as XRP’s utility expands. With central banks partnering with Ripple and the XRP Ledger poised to become integral to the next-generation financial system, Farina suggests that the digital asset’s price could soar to $10, $100, or beyond. ""Most investors will sell too early,"" Farina noted, pointing out a common mistake he has observed among retail traders. He cited the case of some holders who cashed out on their XRP at $0.80 and $1 in November, expecting a retracement that never came.Farina stressed that this emotional decision-making could cost them significant gains as XRP reaches its full potential.Avoiding Common PitfallsFarina also highlighted a critical error many investors make: leaving their XRP on exchanges. He warned that exchange-held XRP could be vulnerable to supply shocks or liquidation events, as demonstrated in a recent incident where some exchanges failed to cover short positions.To mitigate these risks, Farina urged investors to store their XRP in cold wallets and manage their private keys. ""Don’t trust crypto exchanges,"" he cautioned.Furthermore, Farina highlighted that another benefit of holding XRP off exchanges is that it shields investors from making emotional decisions, as constant price fluctuations during bull and bear markets can take a toll on one’s mental health. He cautioned XRP holders to avoid constantly monitoring their holdings, though checking market charts occasionally is fine. ""I don’t really know how much money I have in XRP. I check the chart, but I’m not checking my wallet to see how much money I have. Yes, i have a lot of XRP, but if I’m thinking in dollars, I have no idea,"" he said.XRP Long-Term PerspectiveFor those willing to hold XRP through market fluctuations and resist the urge to sell prematurely, Farina believes the rewards will be substantial. He urged community members to be part of the 5%, or even the 1%, who stay invested in XRP. ""Holding 1,000 XRP could be the key to financial freedom by 2030 or sooner,"" he concluded.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | WALLET | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/21/expert-explains-why-you-need-to-hold-at-least-1000-xrp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-explains-why-you-need-to-hold-at-least-1000-xrp,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Over the past month, Ether has crossed this threshold multiple times , peaking at $4,077 on Dec. 6, but it has failed to sustain momentum, data from CoinMarketCap reveals. In a Dec. 20 report, Rekt Capital stated the significance of $3,000 as a new psychological support level. This benchmark was last tested on Nov. 9, marking Ether’s lowest point since early August. As of now, Ether is trading at $3,466, with the analyst warning that its price could slide further, potentially dipping more than 10% toward the $3,000 range. Consolidation and Patterns Signal Uncertain Future Rekt Capital suggested that Ethereum might consolidate between $3,000 and $4,000 in the short term. The formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern — a bullish indicator signaling potential trend reversal — could emerge if Ether stabilizes near the lower support level. “It will be worth watching whether ETH could form a bottom in and around that area,” the analyst noted. Despite this bearish outlook, other factors could bolster Ethereum’s price trajectory. Data from CryptoQuant shows that ETH balances on exchanges have dropped to an 8.5-year low, with just 9.2 million ETH remaining — a nearly 10% reduction over the past year. Reduced supply on exchanges often limits selling pressure, potentially laying the groundwork for upward price movement. Spot Ethereum ETFs Gain Traction Adding to Ethereum’s prospects, spot Ether ETFs have witnessed steady growth . Since their launch in the U.S. on July 23, these funds have attracted approximately $2.43 billion, according to Farside data. Analysts predict this upward trend will continue, particularly if regulators approve staking-related yield generation for these ETFs. Asset manager VanEck has forecasted Ether’s price could reach $6,000 by late 2025 and $20,000 by 2030 , fueled by growing ETF inflows and broader market adoption. However, initial enthusiasm surrounding spot Ether ETFs has yet to yield immediate results. Comparisons to Bitcoin’s post-ETF performance have tempered expectations of Ether surpassing its all-time high of $5,000 by year-end.

37917240,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666072,1734773429,"Ethereum Rejected At $4,000 Resistance Again: What Lies Ahead For ETH?","Due to yesterday’s crypto market rout, Ethereum (ETH) has now faced rejection at the key $4,000 resistance level for three times since March 2024. The second-largest cryptocurrency by reported market cap is now trading at the $3,400 level, down 6.7% in the past 24 hours. What’s Behind Ethereum’s Underwhelming Price Performance? While ETH has posted a respectable 47% year-to-date (YTD) gain, it has been outpaced by other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP, which have recorded significantly higher returns in the same period. Several factors appear to be holding back Ethereum’s price momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-Reward Ratio Is Now Attractive, Brokerage Firm Explains One contributing factor is Ethereum’s comparatively weaker brand recognition versus Bitcoin. This was highlighted by the lackluster response to the launch of spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in August. The introduction of these ETFs failed to generate any meaningful price movement for ETH. Data further reveals a significant disparity in investor interest between the two assets. The total net assets held in U.S. spot ETH ETFs currently amount to $11.98 billion. In contrast, spot BTC ETFs hold $109.66 billion – nearly ten times as much. Additionally, yesterday saw over $60 million in outflows from spot ETH ETFs, marking the largest single-day outflow since November 19. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that social sentiment around ETH has reached its lowest point in a year. However, based on historical trends, this could paradoxically signal a bullish opportunity for Ethereum. Futures traders have also turned bearish on ETH, as the aggregated premium for futures positions flipped negative for the first time since November 6. The market downturn triggered Ethereum’s largest liquidation event since December 9, with $299 million liquidated in a single day. Such large-scale liquidations often lead to cascading sell-offs and heightened price volatility. Another recurring concern stems from the Ethereum Foundation’s tendency to sell ETH near local price peaks. In a recent X post, Lookonchain noted that the Ethereum Foundation sold 100 ETH on December 17. Following this sale, ETH’s price has dropped approximately 17%. Further skepticism surrounds Ethereum’s supply issuance. A recent Binance Research report highlighted that ETH’s relatively high issuance rate raises questions about its “ultrasound money” narrative, which suggests Ethereum is a deflationary asset. Is Ethereum Set For A Bounce? Seasoned crypto analyst @Trader_XO stated that they bought spot ETH at the $3,200 price level yesterday. The analyst added that they expect “a good few weeks” of price consolidation before ETH’s next leg up. Related Reading: 7.8M Ethereum Leaves Binance In Two Months—What Does This Mean for ETH? Meanwhile, crypto trader @CryptoShadowOff identified a potential ascending triangle formation on ETH’s monthly chart. According to their analysis, ETH could drop further to the $2,800 range before targeting a new all-time high (ATH). Market analyst @CryptoBullet1 emphasized that on the 4-hour chart, ETH has not been this oversold since August 5, indicating a bounce may be on the horizon. At press time, ETH trades at $3,400, down 6% in the past 24 hours.

37917559,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52723,1734773408,AVAX’s Top 10 Dreams on Hold as TRON Dominates—Rollblock is the Wildcard,"While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, many top altcoins compete for the remaining 8 positions in the top 10 crypto ranking. Currently, Avalanche (AVAX) and Tron (TRX) are in a stiff battle for the 10th position based on their market cap values. Both the AVAX and TRX prices have also returned decent gains in the past month. However, Rollblock, a new crypto, has been tipped to be the wildcard among the top cryptocurrencies after raising over $7.4 million during its presale. Let’s find out why Rollblock stands a chance. Tron loses steam amid the market decline Tron has been one of the best-performing coins this year, evident in its over 130% growth within the past 12 months. Though the TRX price has gone up in the past month, accumulating over 20% gains in the process. The TRX price at the time of writing is around $0.24, but the recent decline suggests potentially lower price points unless the bulls regain the market. The decline in the TRX price is largely due to the recent struggles in the broader crypto market. Coin prices have been falling due to significant selling pressure among crypto traders, and TRX is also included. Avalanche eyes the top 10 spot after recent rally Like TRX and other altcoins, the AVAX price has also been on a decline. As of the time of writing, the year-on-year (YOY) growth in the AVAX price stands at -13.45%, indicating its struggles to reach higher price points. Though AVAX has surged by approximately 10% in the past month, reaching around $36 in the process, it’s currently plunging. However, AVAX trails TRX strongly on the top 10 crypto chart. To keep the dream alive, AVAX will need a massive boost in its market cap, which is around $14.9 billion compared to Tron’s $20.6 billion. Rollblock is poised as the unlikely winner While the competition between AVAX and TRON heats up, Rollblock is rearing its head as an underdog that could enter the top 10 list soon. For context, the ongoing Rollblock presale has already raised over $7.4 million within a few months, causing optimistic predictions that its market cap will get a massive boost when the project fully launches. Utility will be the major driver for Rollblock’s growth over the coming months, as the token has various use cases within the Rollblock Casino ecosystem. One of the more exciting ones includes serving RBLK as the reward token for Rollblock Casino players and investors. Users can wager on games with RBLK or earn passive income from its staking opportunities. With up to 30% APY up for grabs, the staking program promises better rewards than many centralized and decentralized staking platforms. Moreover, Rollblock Casino users get rewarded generously as part of its revenue-sharing system, which offers them a portion of the casino’s profits as weekly rewards. Players also get to enjoy casino bonuses like VIP rewards and rakeback offers. Conclusion The Rollblock project is in presale stage 9, offering an exciting opportunity for investors to get the next-gen casino token at a discounted rate of $0.043. With a proposed price of $0.052 in stage 10, now is the perfect time to lock in some tokens for guaranteed gains. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

37917087,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631376,1734772777,"Whales switch focus to Ethereum as markets rebound – Will ETH hit $5,000 before 2025?","Ethereum (ETH) has shown signs of recovery following a sharp market downturn, with significant whale activity that saw large Ether holders have been making withdrawals from exchanges. After experiencing declines exceeding 15% following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut decision for 2025, Ethereum appears to be finding stability near the $3,400 level. This newfound steadiness may be attributed to investors seizing the opportunity to buy the dip, as suggested by ongoing exchange outflows. A downtrend in Ethereum’s exchange reserve chart highlights a consistent pattern of investors withdrawing ETH from exchanges, which signals an accumulation phase. The altcoin’s price had plummeted by over 22.5% during the recent market turbulence, breaking through the critical $3,500 support level. However, it has since reclaimed a key position, bouncing back from the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $3,100. Analysts suggest that the next support level to watch is around $2,850. Surge in Ethereum market activity signals growing interest Amid Ethereum’s current price correction, investors are now flocking the markets to buy the altcoin, with some expressing optimism that ETH will draw a path back to $4,000. Blockchain analytics platform LookOnChain reported that ten newly created wallets collectively withdrew 17,698 ETH, valued at approximately $61.66 million at the time, from Binance. 10 fresh wallets withdrew 17,698 $ETH ($61.66M) from #Binance after the market rebound.

This substantial purchase coincided with Ethereum’s price rebounding after a steep decline. Institutional investors’ interest in Ethereum has also surged, evidenced by market activity from public figures like Donald Trump-affiliated World Liberty Finance , which recently purchased 759 ETH worth $2.6 million at current valuations. The bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum is further underscored by the continued rise in staked ETH. Per IntoTheBlock data , there’s currently over 54.7 million ETH tokens staked, supported by a base of more than 206,000 unique stakers. This trend suggests long-term optimism among investors who appear committed to holding their ETH positions for the foreseeable future. Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also demonstrated strong performance, recording seven consecutive weeks of net inflows. Recent data reveals a record-breaking $1.6 billion in inflows in December alone. Ethereum ETFs are booming this December, pulling in $1.66B—74% of total inflows since launch. 🚀 BlackRock's ETHA leads, hitting $292M in a day. Fidelity's FETH follows, but ETH ETFs remain highly concentrated, managing ~$11B total. The ETF race is heating up! 🔥 #Ethereum … pic.twitter.com/QvnYix7OKN — Sankalp Hashtalk (@HashtalkSankalp) December 20, 2024 Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, emphasized the significance of these developments in a December 20 post on X, stating that net inflows into ETH ETFs are “on pace with gold ETFs.” He also predicted that inflows would accelerate moving forward. Analysts predict this uptrend may persist into 2025, particularly if robust spot ETH price performance enhances ETF returns. Furthermore, regulatory approval for ETFs to generate yields from staking could amplify their appeal. Analysts predict a strong future for Ethereum Despite the recent market volatility, Ethereum’s long-term projections remain optimistic. Some analysts foresee the cryptocurrency reaching as high as $8,800, while more conservative estimates, such as those from asset manager VanEck, suggest a cycle peak of $6,000. VanEck also projects Bitcoin’s price to hit $180,000 by 2025, indicating a strong upward trajectory for major cryptocurrencies even if Ethereum does not outperform Bitcoin in absolute terms. Ethereum’s resurgence follows a period when it was trading near $4,000 before losing momentum. The current recovery phase demonstrates the cryptocurrency’s resilience, with whales and retail investors alike taking advantage of the price dips to accumulate ETH.

El Salvador has decided to continue with its Bitcoin purchases, despite the IMF’s warnings, while MetaMask innovates by launching its crypto debit card for Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. El Salvador has revealed plans to continue buying bitcoin, maybe at a faster pace, despite a financing arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that proposes reducing its exposure to the cryptocurrency. Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s national bitcoin office, claimed that bitcoin will remain legal tender in the country and that the government will continue to add to its strategic reserves. El Salvador signed a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF on Wednesday, which included a review of its bitcoin rules, including the requirement that all tax payments be made in US dollars. According to an IMF spokeswoman, anticipated legal amendments will make bitcoin acceptance voluntary in the private sector. Analysts believe that the government’s effort to acquire more Bitcoin is a strategy to counter negative opinions of the cryptocurrency following the agreement with the IMF. MetaMask launches crypto debit card in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico MetaMask introduced the MetaMask Card in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, a huge step forward for cryptocurrency followers in Latin America. This unique debit card enables users to easily spend their digital assets in real-time anywhere Mastercard is accepted, signalling a significant shift in the accessibility of blockchain technology for ordinary expenditures. The MetaMask Card works with the Linea network, allowing users to convert their cryptocurrencies, such as USDC, USDT, and WETH, into fiat currency on the fly at millions of businesses worldwide. This technology, developed in collaboration with Mastercard and Baanx, has the potential to open up new paths for cryptocurrency usage in places where traditional banking institutions may be less resilient. LATAM Crypto companies in legal “grey zones, according to Bitso report According to Bitso , Latin America has a diversified regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico setting the standard. This regulatory mosaic causes legal confusion for Bitcoin users, forcing some businesses to operate in “grey zones” where the legality of their activity is unclear. The report “From Barriers to Bridges: How Blockchain and Stablecoins Can Remap Cross-Border Payments in Latin America” examines the issues that the region’s businesses face. The report underlines that, while blockchain technology and stablecoins have disruptive potential, many businesses feel forced to traverse uncertain legal frameworks due to a lack of clear rules. The lack of stated prohibitions does not reduce uncertainty, making it harder for businesses to fully adopt blockchain technology into their operations. As a result, the complicated regulatory framework highlights the need for greater clarity in supervision and compliance throughout the area. Argentina’s tight currency controls and restrictive rules have long impeded cross-border trade. Domestic digital payments, on the other hand, have thrived, with platforms like Mercado Pago gaining over 12 million users and real-time payment systems like Transferencias 3.0 becoming increasingly popular. Despite the lack of a complete fintech law, Argentina’s regulatory requirements are often less stringent, allowing businesses to operate while adhering to consumer protection laws, digital signatures, tax regulations, and anti-money laundering policies.

The CCT standard employs a lock-and-mint mechanism for transferring tokens from Ethereum to other chains and a burn-and-mint process for cross-chain transfers among these networks. This framework ensures token security, seamless interoperability, and scalability. Shibarium has also integrated Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) as its canonical cross-chain infrastructure. This adoption allows developers within the Shiba Inu ecosystem to build reliable and rich cross-chain applications. According to the official blog post announcing the partnership, Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs, stated that the integration of CCIP will “enhance capabilities and drive wide adoption” of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The Shiba Inu developers have big dreams for the ecosystem, and this is a crucial step forward. Advanced-Data Solutions In addition to interoperability, Shiba Inu has adopted Chainlink’s Data Streams for low-latency market data. This solution provides high-frequency data for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, featuring liquidity-weighted bid-ask spreads and sub-second execution speeds. It enhances the transparency and decentralization of market data while ensuring superior performance.

Speaking after the release of the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, Gapen highlighted underlying trends in inflation and the Fed’s potential policy trajectory. Gapen assessed the November PCE report, which showed a modest increase of 0.1, as positive. It noted that the decline in housing-related inflation was a significant factor and that progress was being made in addressing one of the root causes of high inflation. However, there remains some persistence in goods prices, particularly in the auto sector, due to storm-related disruptions. “The data shows that inflation is falling,” Gapen said, adding that more confirmation would be needed before the Fed would consider cutting interest rates as early as March. Related News: Deutsche Bank Teaming Up With This Binance-Listed Altcoin To Build Its Own Blockchain Gapen predicts that December inflation figures could follow a similar pattern, with an increase between 0.17% and 0.2%. However, January could show a seasonal increase. Despite these fluctuations, he sees a clear trend toward disinflation that could affect the Fed’s future decisions. While the Fed has maintained a hawkish tone recently, Gapen believes that stance is not set in stone. He pointed to comments from Chairman Jerome Powell that monetary policy remains restrictive, but less so than in previous months. “There’s a lot of inflation tolerance in their forecasts,” Gapen said, adding that the Fed doesn’t expect to reach its 2% inflation target by 2027. “If activity slows, inflation falls and labor markets soften, the Fed could shift to a more dovish approach.” *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s price has seen notable fluctuations recently. In the past week, ETH has dropped by 10.38%, indicating a short-term bearish trend. However, over the last month, the cryptocurrency has risen by 7.05%, showing signs of recovery. Looking at the six-month timeframe, ETH has experienced a slight decline of 2.34%, reflecting overall market volatility. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $3,648.43 and $4,137.17. The nearest resistance level is at $4,317.86, while the closest support is at $3,340.38. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 20.60, suggesting that ETH is oversold and may be due for a rebound. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $3,622.00, which is below the 100-day average of $3,869.08, indicating a potential shift in momentum. If Ethereum manages to break above the resistance at $4,317.86, it could aim for the next target at $4,806.60, representing a possible increase of around 16%. On the downside, falling below the support at $3,340.38 might lead to a drop towards $2,851.64, which would be a decrease of approximately 22%. Traders are watching these key levels closely to gauge Ethereum’s next move. Conclusion Ethereum’s climb to $6K is significant, but XYZVerse’s surge positions it as a standout, uniting sports fans in a community-driven memecoin aiming for massive growth.

As prices have corrected, Binance CEO CZ shared a sardonic remark on social media about Bitcoin’s “crash” from $101,000 to $85,000. He later shared a post suggesting Bitcoin could reach another all-time high (ATH) soon, showing his positive outlook despite market fluctuations. Wait for the new headline, #bitcoin ATH again, again, again… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) December 20, 2024 Investors Eye the Bitcoin Dip Social media platforms show a rise in discussions about strategically buying the dip. Santiment reports that mentions of Bitcoin and “buying the dip” across platforms like Reddit, Telegram, and 4Chan are at their highest levels since April 2024.

37917265,https://invezz.com/?p=2398350,1734771300,"HYPE, MOVE, BGB bucked market trend as Bitcoin crashed to low 90s this week","It’s been a volatile week for Bitcoin, with the leading cryptocurrency rallying to a new all-time high of $108,135 before crashing to a low of $92,805 on Friday. Over $400 billion was wiped out from the overall cryptocurrency market capitalisation, with the drop accelerating late last week amidst bearish macroeconomic events. As of December 20, the market cap stood at a little over $3.5 trillion, down from after almost hitting $4 trillion on December 17. The altcoin market lost most of the weekly gains towards the end of the week as Bitcoin slipped below the $100,000 mark as bears took control. The pre-Christmas altseason failed to materialise, with the Altcoin Season Index dwindling to the low 40s from the 65 seen last week. Only three top altcoins managed to retain weekly gains: HYPE, MOVE, and BGB secured the top spots on this week’s gainers list, while most other tokens posted losses. Why is Bitcoin going down? Bitcoin initially rallied to an all-time high this week, driven by optimism over a potential Bitcoin strategic reserve and strong participation from both retail and institutional traders. However, hawkish remarks from the Federal Reserve spooked the market, pushing it below the six-figure mark. On December 18, the Federal Reserve delivered its third rate cut of the year, lowering its key interest rate by a quarter-point. However, revised core PCE inflation projections for 2025, rising from 2.2% to 2.5%, coupled with a more hawkish outlook limiting 2025 rate cuts to just two instead of four, came as bad news for the crypto space, driving the market-wide sell-off. Adding to the bearish sentiment, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the Federal Reserve isn’t allowed to hold Bitcoin and that they were not looking to amend laws that would allow such a provision. The situation was further catapulted by escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, with both countries having launched missile strikes this week. With these bearish catalysts in play, Bitcoin ETFs saw $680 million in outflows on Friday. Over $1.4 billion was wiped out of the crypto market on December 20, and a lot of the sell-side pressure originated on centralised exchanges. However, some metrics suggest Bitcoin’s rally isn’t over, as price corrections are perceived as a common occurrence during an ongoing bull run. For instance, the market value to realized value (MVRV-Z) score, which typically spikes during major corrections, peaked at 2.89 earlier this week. This remains significantly lower than the 5.25 seen during the March 2021 correction, suggesting there could still be room for further upside as the market stabilizes. Additionally, several businesses, led by US-based MicroStrategy and Japan’s Metaplanet, increased their Bitcoin holdings. Meanwhile, data from Into The Block revealed a surge in late-week activity, with significant inflows into whale wallets. Long-term projections for BTC remained well beyond $100,000. Ark Invest CEO said on Friday that BTC could be valued at $1 million within the next five years, citing its fixed supply as the key driver. More predictions put Bitcoin between $120,000 to $180,000 by the end of 2026. Multiple analysts noted that Bitcoin’s current price action mirrors patterns from previous bull runs, where the price corrected after reaching a new high before rallying to even greater levels. Analyst Lark Davis predicts a 10-15% pullback before Bitcoin resumes its upward trajectory, which could push it to a new all-time high. Meanwhile, pseudonymous analyst EtherNasyonal pointed to the 2020-2021 bull run, stating that this is just the start of a new cycle. He projected Bitcoin could exceed $120,000 during the 2024-2025 season if history were to repeat. The crypto fear and greed index is near 75, indicating that the bullish sentiment hasn’t completely faded, with BTC seeing a surge in market dominance to 57.5% from the 55% seen last week. With most altcoins losing gains accumulated over the past week, the top performers were: Hyperliquid Hyperliquid (HYPE) led the highest gains in the last 7 days among the largest 100 crypto assets tracked by CoinGecko. Source: CoinMarketCap The altcoin was exchanging hands at its all-time high of $30.12 at press time, up over 68% in the past week, while its market cap was seated at $10.3 billion. HYPE’s price rally also coincided with an almost 2,550% surge in daily trading volume, which hovered over $600 million. Most of the gains came after news that Bitget Wallet, a web3 non-custodial wallet, added support for the HyperEVM testnet. The integration gives users access to the Hyperliquid platform. With HyperEVM, the HYPE token will now be used for gas fees and can also support lending, staking, and other DeFi activities, thus boosting its utility and demand, which has likely attracted the attention of investors. Movement Over the past week, Movement (MOVE) surged 37%, hitting an intraday high of $0.877 on December 20 while its market cap was standing at $1.85 billion at press time. Source: CoinMarketCap The altcoin’s price rally came with a 47% spike in daily trading volume, surpassing $2 billion. CoinGlass data also showed futures market open interest hit a record $100 million on Dec. 20, nearly double the previous day’s $56.03 million, highlighting growing trader demand. The altcoin’s gains seem largely driven by its collaboration with BitGo, a top digital asset custody and security firm, to integrate WBTC into Movement’s mainnet. The integration is set to expand Movement’s DeFi capabilities, offering users greater opportunities for asset use, liquidity provision, and participation in decentralized financial services. Bitget Token Bitget Token (BGB) rose 28.7% over the past week, exchanging hands at $4.22 at the time of writing and extending its monthly gains to over 200%. The altcoin’s market cap was sitting at $5.7 billion, while its daily trading volume was around $519 million. Source: CoinMarketCap BGB’s weekly surge has pushed its yearly gains to above 500%, making it one of the top-performing altcoins of the year. Although there doesn’t seem to be a clear reason for the token’s rise, much of the momentum appears to stem from the exchange’s strong performance in recent months. More recently, the BGB token gained investor attention after the crypto exchange Bitget announced a partnership with Tron, which includes a $10 million purchase of Tron’s native token, TRX. Through the partnership, Bitget demonstrated its commitment to expanding the BItget ecosystem, boosting investor interest in BGB and driving its price higher.

37916095,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395953,1734770999,U.S. Blacklists China’s Sophgo Amid Huawei AI Chip Scandal,"The post U.S. Blacklists China’s Sophgo Amid Huawei AI Chip Scandal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. government has taken a bold step against Chinese chipmaker Sophgo , now under investigation for its role in a major Huawei AI processor scandal. This action is part of a larger push by the Biden administration to crack down on companies aiding Huawei in bypassing U.S. restrictions. Tensions are heating up between the U.S. and China, and this move isn’t going to go unnoticed. Read on to find out more about the latest twist in this high-stakes battle. The Huawei Connection Sophgo, a Chinese chip designer linked to Bitcoin mining equipment supplier Bitmain, has attracted the U.S. government’s attention. A recent investigation found that a chip made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for Sophgo ended up in Huawei’s Ascend 910B AI processor. This processor is part of Huawei’s advanced AI systems, and the discovery has raised concerns in Washington. U.S. Makes Its Moves In response, the U.S. Department of Commerce is working to add Sophgo to its Entity List, which would block the company from receiving important U.S. technology and components. Although the chip was found in Huawei’s product, Sophgo has denied having any business dealings with the Chinese telecom giant, claiming no connection to Huawei. However, U.S. officials remain skeptical, especially after the chip was discovered in Huawei’s systems. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Tether Invests $775M in Rumble and Targets AI Domination by 2025 , Sophgo’s Work with Chinese Entities Beyond its links to Huawei, Sophgo is involved with Chinese state-owned organizations. The company supplies AI chips to local government agencies, including police stations, where they are used in surveillance technologies. This connection has raised alarms among U.S. officials, who worry these chips could be used in ways that threaten national security. TSMC Cuts Ties with Sophgo After the discovery, TSMC confirmed that the chip found in Huawei’s AI system matched Sophgo’s design. As a result, TSMC announced it would stop shipping to Sophgo. Although TSMC had already halted shipments to Huawei in 2020, this incident shows how companies can still find ways to acquire crucial components despite restrictions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37927453,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106064,1734769959,Market Analyst Predicts Timeline for XRP to Hit $6,"A notable market watcher provides a timeline for XRP to claim a price that is nearly double its 2017/2018 all-time high. For context, XRP has been navigating a volatile market environment amid broader bearish trends triggered by hawkish Federal Reserve commentary. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's recent statements suggested lower-than-expected interest rate cuts in 2025. A Steep DropThis reality, coupled with comments around legislative restrictions barring the Fed from holding Bitcoin, has weighed heavily on the cryptocurrency market. XRP responded with steep losses, plunging 9.91% on Wednesday and another 3.24% the following day. The token dropped to $1.96 on Dec. 20, but bullish momentum emerged, driving a 4.35% rebound to $2.37 at press time this morning.Meanwhile, analysts like CryptoBull believe this correction is a precursor to a major breakout. CryptoBull has shared a chart featuring a symmetrical triangle formation and signaling that XRP may be completing its correction phase. According to the notable market commentator, this structure will resolve within the next week. He expects such a resolution to propel XRP to a new all-time high of $6 within days of the breakout. XRP's Symmetrical Triangle The 1-day chart shows that the symmetrical triangle pattern developed following XRP's sharp drop from $2.9, its seven-year peak, on Dec. 3. This pattern typically represents market indecision, with prices consolidating as bulls and bears compete for dominance. Notably, with XRP now close to the triangle's apex, this position suggests a breakout is imminent. XRP 1D Chart | CryptoBull The structure began with a steep decline (wave A), followed by a recovery (wave B). However, the latest correction has triggered a steeper drop to lower lows, representing wave C. CryptoBull's chart suggests the impending recovery could allow XRP again retest the upper trendline of the triangle, completing wave D. Nonetheless, the chart indicates that this retest will lead to another pullback (wave E), with a recovery from this pullback potentially breaching the triangle's resistance.For context, key price levels in the chart include $2.4 as immediate resistance and $2.0 as a major support. A breakout above $2.4 could see XRP testing its previous high of $2.9 before targeting the $6 milestone . CryptoBull believes $6 could materialize in the next few days.XRP Following 2017 Fractal In a separate analysis, CryptoBull drew parallels between XRP's current trajectory and its historic 2017 rally. Particularly, in March 2017, XRP began a multi-month surge that culminated in an all-time high. https://twitter.com/CryptoBull2020/status/1869726702575964669The analyst suggests XRP is mirroring this pattern, having already achieved a key target of $1.96. If this pattern holds, CryptoBull says XRP could hit $6.28 by the end of December 2024. Furthermore, he predicts a meteoric rise to $40 by the end of January 2025.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/21/market-analyst-predicts-timeline-for-xrp-to-hit-6/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-analyst-predicts-timeline-for-xrp-to-hit-6,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37915819,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52721,1734769858,Cardano Faces a Challenger: Can the OG Outperform This Rising Crypto Capturing Whale Attention?,"Cardano , known for its robust blockchain ecosystem and exceptional smart contract capabilities, has long been a favorite in the crypto world. However, Rollblock , a rising crypto challenger, is giving ADA a run for its money while capturing the attention of whales. This crypto casino is currently on a presale price of $0.043 – a perfect time to get in. While whales evaluate the Cardano price and market corrections, Rollblock’s innovative GambleFi model and strong community backing make it a contender worth watching. Can Cardano outperform this new powerhouse? Let’s find out. How Rollblock’s community and RBLK token drive this rising crypto’s success Rising crypto Rollblock is making waves in the crypto community, and it’s easy to see why whales are paying attention. Security is at the heart of this crypto casino, with advanced encryption and blockchain technology protecting every transaction. Moreover, its scalable architecture ensures smooth performance, even as more users and transactions join the network. The crypto world thrives on community, and this is a feature Rollblock maximizes to the fullest. The platform offers spaces for real-time updates, user interactions, and feedback, fostering a lively ecosystem where everyone’s voice matters. This sense of connection builds trust and keeps users coming back. The RBLK token plays a significant role in Rollblock’s success. It rewards players for their activity, encouraging loyalty while enhancing your gaming experience. These continuous rewards help maintain a vibrant user base and set Rollblock apart from its competitors. Also, it’s worth mentioning the economic stability of the RBLK token as another major draw. A portion of the casino’s revenue is used to buy back tokens, supporting their value and ensuring steady growth. No wonder this rising crypto has captured so much attention. Whale moves and stability: What’s next for the Cardano price? Cardano is starting to bounce back after a recent market dip. Last month, Cardano price dropped from about $1.40 to $0.7972, losing more than 40% of its value. The price struggled to stay above $1.20 and kept falling as more people sold. There was a lot of buying and selling activity at key points, but it wasn’t enough to stop the decline. But ADA’s fortunes are changing. Big investors, known as whales, are buying more again, showing trust in the platform. This could steady the Cardano price and help it grow stronger. Another sign is Cardano’s ADX, now at 21.4, meaning the recent market trends are weakening. This could allow the Cardano price to settle and build a solid base before moving again. With key support levels and whales buying in, Cardano price is set for recovery, proving its strength in a tricky crypto market. Cardano’s legacy or Rollblock’s rising momentum? The choice is yours! Can the OG, Cardano , outperform this rising crypto , Rollblock? It is unlikely. Both offer compelling stories, but your journey depends on what excites you most. If you value innovation and GambleFi’s rewards, Rollblock could be your game-changer. For tried-and-true blockchain prowess, Cardano is a classic. Either way, you’re in for an exciting ride—choose wisely! Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

These autonomous systems are already carving out a niche in the digital economy, building decentralized applications, launching tokens, and interacting with users without human intervention. As their influence grows, they are expected to reshape decentralized communities while facing significant technical and regulatory challenges. J.D. Seraphine, a Web3 AI developer at Raiinmaker, sees agentic AIs playing a pivotal role in the evolution of blockchain ecosystems. Early use cases like cryptocurrency staking and onchain trading have emerged as viable avenues for these systems. Matt Hougan, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, stated that staking is a logical starting point. “We’ll see a lot of experiments, but staking seems like a logical first step for agentic AIs,” he said. Staking and Onchain Trading Take Center Stage Currently, approximately 10,000 AI agents operate within Web3, collectively generating millions of dollars weekly through onchain activities, according to a VanEck report. The asset manager predicts this number will soar to over 1 million by the end of 2025. Projects like ai16z and Virtuals showcase these advancements. Notably, ai16z’s autonomous agent, Eliza, manages a liquidity pool and reportedly achieves annualized returns exceeding 60%. Staking, which involves locking tokens with blockchain validators to secure the network, stands out as an early use case for AI . By automating the process, agentic AIs simplify participation in blockchain security while offering competitive returns. Challenges for AI Integration in Web3 Despite these advancements, hurdles remain. Michael Casey, co-founder of the Decentralized AI Society, highlighted the risks of centralization in AI. “Without decentralization, centralized, misaligned systems will drive us off a cliff, especially with AI,” he warned. Additionally, decentralized AI systems currently lag behind centralized platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT in terms of speed and computational capabilities. Regulatory scrutiny is another significant concern for AI in Web3 sector. As decentralized AI expands, governments are expected to impose stricter oversight. Casey pointed out that major players like OpenAI are advocating for rules that could disadvantage decentralized models. J.D. Seraphine noted the need for decentralized solutions to maintain high-quality training data while protecting user privacy.

37915817,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52790,1734769588,Ripple CEO Pinpoints Aspect Where XRP Is Superior to Bitcoin,"With many altcoins looking to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance, the debate of the efficacy of cryptocurrencies for payments often comes up. Recently, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted key issues with Bitcoin’s functionality as a payment system during a discussion shared by crypto expert Levi (@LeviRietveld) on X. Commenting on XRP’s superiority when used for payments, Garlinghouse noted that Bitcoin transactions often take an hour to confirm and can incur high fees. This makes Bitcoin impractical for everyday transactions, an aspect where XRP shines. XRP’s Superiority Over Bitcoin Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. It’s often called digital gold due to its role as a store of value. However, its limitations as a payment system are frequently criticized. Bitcoin has an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. It can stretch to longer periods during network congestion. This, combined with fluctuating fees renders it suboptimal for microtransactions or real-time payments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In contrast, XRP, the cryptocurrency used within Ripple’s payment ecosystem, offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative. XRP’s transaction confirmation typically occurs within seconds, with fees averaging a few cents or even a fraction of a cent. These features make XRP particularly appealing for cross-border payments and high-volume financial activities. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has previously commented on XRP’s advantages over Bitcoin , and many other experts have openly advocated for XRP’s superiority in payments, citing its scalability and efficiency. A recent Bitcoin transaction with a notably high fee has reignited discussions about Bitcoin’s practical use in payments. As network congestion increases, Bitcoin users may face exorbitant fees, undermining its appeal for everyday transactions. XRP, with its consistent low-cost structure, avoids these pitfalls, offering predictability and affordability to users. Is Bitcoin’s Time At the Top Over? Bitcoin still has its uses. As Garlinghouse noted, Bitcoin has succeeded in many ways as an experiment but the crypto market has to evolve. The use of Bitcoin as an everyday currency is an important part of this evolution. For use cases involving fast, low-cost transactions, XRP demonstrates clear advantages over Bitcoin. Ripple’s partnerships with banks and remittance companies show XRP’s capability as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions and regular payments. This aligns with Ripple’s mission of improving global financial infrastructure and revolutionizing payments through faster, more efficient solutions.

But one token, HYPE from Hyperliquid, has recently grabbed the spotlight in a big way. With a market cap surpassing $10 billion and its price soaring above $30, HYPE is making a splash in the DeFi space. In the midst of a volatile market, its 40% surge in just 24 hours has placed it firmly in the top 20. How? Why is HYPE capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts everywhere? Let’s dive in and uncover the story behind this rising star. HYPE’s Rapid Rise: What’s the Secret? In just 24 hours, HYPE saw an impressive 40% increase, catapulting it to the 19th position in market capitalization. Its trading volume also grew by 53.03%, adding to its appeal. A key factor in HYPE’s rise is its limited supply—only 270.9 million HYPE tokens are currently in circulation, out of a total maximum supply of 1 billion. This scarcity has likely played a major role in driving up its value. source : Dexscreener While much of the crypto market is facing challenges— Bitcoin dropped from $108,000 to $92,000 after a speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell , and many altcoins lost more than 25% before bouncing back—HYPE has managed to rise above the volatility. The Airdrop That Changed Everything HYPE’s success didn’t come out of nowhere. It all began with the largest crypto airdrop in history. Hyperliquid distributed 310 million tokens to over 94,000 eligible addresses . So far, 270 million tokens have been claimed, with a value of around $8.9 billion. This is bigger than Uniswap’s record-breaking 2020 airdrop, which peaked at $6.4 billion. This massive distribution has helped HYPE gain widespread attention and adoption. Source : ASXN Data The platform behind HYPE, Hyperliquid, stands out for its unique approach. With a total value locked (TVL) of $2.62 billion, Hyperliquid reinvests trading fees into buybacks and ecosystem vaults. This strategy keeps trading costs low while ensuring long-term growth for both the platform and its users. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. Blacklists China’s Sophgo Amid Huawei AI Chip Scandal , What’s Next? HyperEVM and More Growth Hyperliquid isn’t stopping here. The platform is about to launch HyperEVM, a new feature that will add Ethereum-compatible smart contracts to its ecosystem. This will make it easier to build cross-chain apps, which could help Hyperliquid expand its influence in the DeFi space even further.

37915085,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112677,1734768756,U.S. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Discusses Potential Shift in Crypto Policy,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce , a prominent advocate for clear and balanced cryptocurrency regulation, has shed light on a possible shift in the agency’s crypto policy. Speaking in a conversation reported by Coinage’s X account, Peirce discussed the evolving regulatory landscape, the transition period following SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s departure, and the prospects for a more pro-innovation SEC. This potential shift signals hope for the crypto industry, which has faced scrutiny and uncertainty under the current regulatory regime. Hester Peirce: A Voice of Reason in Crypto Regulation Known as “Crypto Mom” within the industry, Hester Peirce has consistently advocated for pragmatic and innovation-friendly crypto policies. Her views often contrast with the SEC’s historically cautious approach to digital assets. Peirce’s latest comments underscore the importance of fostering a regulatory environment that balances investor protection with innovation. Peirce’s Advocacy for Clarity Clear Guidelines: Peirce has repeatedly called for clear, transparent regulations to prevent stifling innovation. Innovation-Friendly Stance: She emphasizes the need for policies that encourage growth in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors while addressing risks effectively. Anticipated Changes in SEC Leadership The impending departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler is a pivotal moment for the agency. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC adopted a stringent approach toward cryptocurrencies, targeting major players and enforcing rules on various crypto activities. What to Expect Post-Gensler Shift Toward Pro-Innovation Policies: Peirce’s comments suggest that the new leadership might adopt a more balanced approach, focusing on fostering innovation while ensuring compliance. Regulatory Modernization: The SEC could streamline outdated regulations to address the unique aspects of blockchain and digital assets. Industry Engagement: A more collaborative relationship between regulators and the crypto industry may emerge, paving the way for mutually beneficial policies. Key Topics Discussed by Peirce Peirce touched on several critical issues that could shape the SEC’s crypto policy going forward: 1. The Pace of Change The regulatory landscape for crypto has been evolving rapidly, often leaving market participants uncertain about compliance requirements. Peirce acknowledged the need for the SEC to adapt more quickly to emerging technologies. 2. Transition Challenges With new leadership on the horizon, Peirce highlighted the importance of ensuring a smooth transition period. This includes aligning the SEC’s goals with the broader push for U.S. leadership in blockchain innovation. 3. Balancing Risks and Opportunities Peirce emphasized that while protecting investors remains a priority, excessive regulation could drive innovation overseas. Striking the right balance will be crucial for maintaining the U.S.’s competitive edge. A More Pro-Innovation SEC: What It Means for Crypto A shift toward pro-innovation policies could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market: Boosting Institutional Confidence: Clearer regulations would encourage institutional investors to participate in the crypto market. Encouraging Startups: A supportive regulatory environment could attract blockchain startups, fostering economic growth. Global Leadership: The U.S. could solidify its position as a leader in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency innovation. Challenges Ahead While optimism surrounds the potential policy shift, challenges remain: Legislative Coordination: The SEC’s policies must align with broader legislative efforts to create a cohesive framework. Fraud and Misuse Risks: Regulators must address concerns about fraud and misuse without overburdening legitimate actors. Global Competition: As other nations adopt crypto-friendly policies, the U.S. must act decisively to remain competitive. The Crypto Industry’s Response The crypto community has welcomed Peirce’s comments as a sign of potential relief from the SEC’s stringent stance. Many industry leaders are hopeful that the SEC will engage more collaboratively with blockchain innovators and prioritize clarity in its regulatory agenda. Conclusion Commissioner Hester Peirce’s discussion of a potential shift in the SEC’s crypto policy offers a glimmer of hope for the industry. Her emphasis on pro-innovation strategies and the transition to new leadership could herald a new era for cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. As the regulatory landscape evolves, the crypto industry and policymakers must work together to foster innovation while addressing risks effectively. The potential for a more balanced, innovation-friendly SEC could pave the way for sustainable growth in the blockchain sector.

(Nasdaq: MSTR), the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, is experiencing a sharp decline in pre-market trading. According to TradingView data, the company’s stock fell by 5.64%, trading at $308.04 as of December 20, 2024. This latest drop extends a worrying trend for the tech and Bitcoin-focused firm, marking a staggering 40% decline since its November 21 peak. MicroStrategy’s Relationship with Bitcoin MicroStrategy is widely known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has made it a proxy for Bitcoin’s market performance. The company holds over 150,000 BTC, positioning it as a corporate leader in cryptocurrency adoption.

Several factors contribute to MicroStrategy’s current stock decline: Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price movements directly affect MicroStrategy’s stock. Recent BTC market corrections have likely influenced the sell-off. Market Sentiment: Investor confidence in tech and crypto-focused firms has wavered amid global economic uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny. Profit-Taking After November’s Rally: MicroStrategy’s peak stock price in November attracted profit-taking by investors, contributing to the subsequent decline. Stock Performance Metrics As of the pre-market session on December 20, 2024: Current Price: $308.04 Percentage Drop: 5.64% from the previous day. Peak-to-Current Decline: Nearly 40% since November 21. The steep decline raises questions about MicroStrategy’s strategy and its exposure to Bitcoin’s volatile market. Long-Term Implications for MicroStrategy While short-term volatility is causing concern among investors, the long-term outlook for MicroStrategy depends on several factors: Bitcoin’s Performance: A rebound in Bitcoin’s price could reverse the downward trend in MicroStrategy’s stock. Corporate Strategy: The company’s continued focus on Bitcoin acquisition could either be a boon or a risk, depending on market trends. Investor Sentiment: Rebuilding investor confidence will be key, especially as MicroStrategy remains a high-risk, high-reward investment. Market Analysts Weigh In Experts have varying opinions on MicroStrategy’s stock trajectory: Bullish Perspective: Analysts bullish on Bitcoin believe that MicroStrategy’s stock could recover alongside a broader crypto market rally. Bearish Perspective: Others caution that the company’s heavy reliance on Bitcoin introduces significant risk, particularly in uncertain market conditions. Impact on Cryptocurrency Markets MicroStrategy’s performance also affects perceptions of Bitcoin as a corporate asset: Positive Feedback Loop: When MicroStrategy’s stock rises, it often boosts confidence in Bitcoin adoption by institutions. Negative Sentiment: Conversely, stock declines can lead to skepticism about Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset. What Investors Should Know For investors, MicroStrategy remains a high-risk, high-reward option due to its unique position as a major Bitcoin holder. Here are some key takeaways: Diversification Is Key: MicroStrategy’s stock may not suit risk-averse investors due to its high volatility. Monitor Bitcoin Trends: The company’s fortunes are closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements, making it crucial to stay informed about the crypto market. Long-Term Outlook: Despite recent declines, MicroStrategy’s bullish stance on Bitcoin positions it as a long-term bet on the cryptocurrency’s success. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s 6% pre-market drop reflects its susceptibility to Bitcoin price movements and broader market sentiment. While the company’s innovative strategy has made it a pioneer in cryptocurrency adoption, its reliance on Bitcoin exposes it to significant volatility. Investors should weigh the risks and rewards of holding MicroStrategy stock carefully. With a nearly 40% decline since November, the company faces challenges but remains a compelling player in the intersection of technology and cryptocurrency.

37914989,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112672,1734768645,Japan’s LDP Pushes for Crypto Tax Reform with Proposed 20% Taxation,"The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan is advocating for a significant overhaul of the country’s cryptocurrency tax policy. According to reports by CoinPost and Japanese media outlets, the proposed reform includes a reduced, separate tax rate of 20% on cryptocurrency trading profits and the introduction of a loss carryforward system. This initiative could mark a pivotal shift in how Japan treats cryptocurrency income, potentially making the nation a more attractive hub for digital asset investors and businesses. The Current Tax System for Cryptocurrency in Japan Under Japan’s existing tax framework, cryptocurrency profits are classified as miscellaneous income , subjecting them to progressive tax rates of up to 55%. This classification places a heavy financial burden on individual investors, particularly those in higher income brackets. Key Features of the Current System High Tax Rates: Progressive rates can discourage active trading and investment. No Loss Carryforward: Investors cannot offset crypto losses against future profits, exacerbating financial risks. Limited Clarity: The lack of detailed regulations creates confusion among taxpayers and accountants alike. What the LDP’s Proposed Tax Reform Entails The LDP’s proposal aims to modernize the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies to align with global standards and foster innovation in Japan’s digital economy. Key Features of the Proposed Reform 20% Separate Tax Rate: Profits from cryptocurrency trading would be taxed at a flat 20%, a significant reduction from the current maximum of 55%. Loss Carryforward System: Investors could offset losses incurred in one tax year against future profits, reducing their overall tax burden. Streamlined Classification: A dedicated tax category for cryptocurrency trading would eliminate ambiguity and ensure uniform application of the law. These changes would align cryptocurrency taxation with other investment categories, such as stocks and forex trading, creating a fairer system for investors. Why the Push for Crypto Tax Reform? The LDP’s push for reform is driven by several factors: Boosting Competitiveness: Japan aims to strengthen its position as a leading crypto-friendly nation amid rising global competition. Encouraging Innovation: Lower taxes and clearer rules could attract blockchain startups and crypto-related businesses to set up operations in Japan. Investor Confidence: Simplified and fairer taxation would encourage more retail and institutional participation in the crypto market. The Global Context: How Japan Compares Japan’s current taxation policy is considered one of the most stringent among developed nations. Comparatively: United States: Crypto gains are taxed as capital gains, with rates varying based on income and holding period. Germany: Long-term crypto holdings are tax-free after one year, providing significant incentives for investors. Singapore: No capital gains tax on cryptocurrency transactions, making it a global crypto hub. The proposed reforms could help Japan remain competitive in the global crypto landscape. Potential Impact of the Reform For Individual Investors Reduced Financial Burden: A flat 20% tax would lower the tax liability for most investors, particularly high-income traders. Increased Market Activity: Lower taxes and loss carryforward provisions could encourage more frequent trading and investment. For Businesses and Startups Favorable Ecosystem: A friendlier tax regime would attract blockchain projects and crypto firms, fostering innovation. Talent Retention: Entrepreneurs and developers may find Japan more appealing, reducing the talent drain to countries with better crypto policies. Challenges and Considerations While the proposed reforms are a step in the right direction, they are not without challenges: Implementation Complexity: Transitioning to a new tax system requires clear guidelines and substantial administrative effort. Potential Revenue Loss: The government may face initial revenue shortfalls from reduced tax rates. Regulatory Oversight: Striking a balance between encouraging innovation and preventing misuse of cryptocurrencies remains critical. Japan’s Crypto Legacy and Future Outlook Japan has been a pioneer in cryptocurrency regulation, being one of the first countries to legalize Bitcoin as a payment method in 2017. The proposed tax reforms are part of its broader effort to maintain leadership in the blockchain and crypto space. By addressing investor concerns and creating a more equitable tax structure, Japan could pave the way for sustainable growth in its digital economy. Conclusion Japan’s LDP is making strides toward a more progressive cryptocurrency tax system with its proposal for a 20% separate tax rate and a loss carryforward system. These changes have the potential to transform the nation’s crypto landscape, making it more attractive for investors and businesses alike. While challenges remain, the proposed reforms signal Japan’s commitment to fostering innovation and maintaining its status as a global leader in the crypto space. If implemented effectively, these changes could position Japan as a top destination for digital asset activity in the years to come.

37914988,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112670,1734768609,Cathie Wood Predicts Bitcoin Could Surpass $1 Million by 2030,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been a topic of speculation and debate, but ARK Investment Management LLC founder Cathie Wood has made a bold prediction: the cryptocurrency could exceed $1 million by 2030. Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Wood attributed her forecast to Bitcoin’s unique supply-and-demand dynamics, its capped supply, and the growing institutional interest driven by favorable regulatory developments. Bitcoin’s Supply Cap: A Key Driver of Price Growth At the heart of Cathie Wood’s prediction is Bitcoin’s immutable supply limit of 21 million coins. Unlike traditional commodities like gold, where higher prices incentivize increased production, Bitcoin’s supply is governed by a decentralized protocol that ensures no more coins can be minted beyond the cap. Wood explained, “Bitcoin’s capped supply makes it fundamentally different from other assets. Its scarcity increases as demand grows, driving value.” This Year’s Rally as a Case Study In 2024, Bitcoin surged past $108,000, highlighting the impact of scarcity on its price. The rally has reaffirmed investor confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Bitcoin vs. Gold: The Scarcity Factor Bitcoin has often been likened to digital gold, but Wood emphasized a key difference: Gold’s Supply Growth: Higher gold prices typically lead to increased mining activity, which boosts supply and moderates price increases. Bitcoin’s Fixed Supply: Bitcoin’s supply is finite, creating a “hard ceiling” that ensures scarcity as demand grows. This distinction has made Bitcoin an attractive alternative to gold, particularly among younger, tech-savvy investors. Regulatory Easing Under Trump Administration Wood also cited anticipated regulatory changes as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s growth. With Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency, the crypto industry expects a more favorable regulatory environment. How Regulation Impacts Bitcoin Institutional Adoption: Clearer regulations could pave the way for increased institutional investment, including Bitcoin spot ETFs. Retail Growth: A friendlier regulatory framework may encourage more retail participation in the crypto market. Global Adoption: U.S. policy often influences global crypto regulation, potentially leading to broader acceptance. Supply and Demand Dynamics in Action Cathie Wood’s prediction hinges on the principle that Bitcoin’s fixed supply, combined with rising demand, will create upward price pressure. Here’s why: Institutional Interest: Institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Geopolitical Factors: Economic instability and inflation fears drive investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge. Adoption Trends: Growing adoption for payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications fuels demand. ARK’s Historical Bitcoin Advocacy ARK Investment Management has long been bullish on Bitcoin. The firm has invested heavily in crypto-related assets and has consistently advocated for the digital currency’s potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. Wood’s $1 million prediction aligns with ARK’s broader investment thesis, which sees Bitcoin as a transformative asset with long-term growth potential. Challenges to Bitcoin’s $1 Million Target While the prediction is optimistic, several challenges could impede Bitcoin’s path to $1 million: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite Trump’s expected easing, the global regulatory landscape remains fragmented. Technological Risks: Cybersecurity threats and network vulnerabilities could undermine investor confidence. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which may deter risk-averse investors. Implications for the Broader Crypto Market If Bitcoin reaches $1 million, it could have a ripple effect across the crypto ecosystem: Altcoin Growth: Rising Bitcoin prices often boost the broader crypto market. Increased Innovation: A bullish Bitcoin market may encourage more blockchain innovation and investment. Global Adoption: Bitcoin’s success could accelerate adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology worldwide. What Investors Should Consider Cathie Wood’s prediction underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s fundamentals and market dynamics. Here’s what investors should keep in mind: Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s price movements can be volatile, but its scarcity-driven growth is a long-term play. Diversification: While Bitcoin holds promise, diversification remains a prudent strategy. Stay Updated: Regularly monitor market trends, regulatory developments, and expert analyses to make informed decisions. Conclusion Cathie Wood’s forecast of Bitcoin surpassing $1 million by 2030 is rooted in the cryptocurrency’s fixed supply, rising demand, and anticipated regulatory easing. While challenges remain, the potential for Bitcoin to reshape global finance is undeniable. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, investors must weigh the risks and rewards of participating in this transformative market. With its capped supply and growing institutional interest, Bitcoin’s journey toward $1 million could redefine the future of money and value.

37914929,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112666,1734768551,BTC Dominance Shows Signs of Recovery After 6% Dip: CryptoQuant CEO’s Insights,"Bitcoin (BTC) , the flagship cryptocurrency, remains a focal point in market discussions as it recovers from a recent 6% dip in dominance. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, this fluctuation doesn’t indicate a traditional altcoin season. Instead, the current market dynamics suggest that liquidity flows into select altcoins rather than the broader altcoin market. BTC Dominance Recovery in Focus In the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin dominance refers to BTC’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto market capitalization. Historically, significant changes in BTC dominance have often heralded shifts in the market, including altcoin booms or Bitcoin’s resurgence. Ki Young Ju shared on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin dominance is rebounding after a noticeable dip. He emphasized that the current conditions do not mirror the classic “alt season” narratives that have characterized past cycles. Instead, a handful of altcoins have outperformed, attracting liquidity, while the majority remain unaffected. What Is Driving BTC Dominance Recovery? The recovery of Bitcoin dominance can be attributed to several market factors: Institutional Interest: Recent developments show increased institutional adoption of Bitcoin, such as spot ETF applications and major partnerships. This continued interest fuels Bitcoin’s position as the leading cryptocurrency. Macro Conditions: As traditional markets grapple with economic uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to emerge as a hedge against inflation, reinforcing its dominance. Altcoin Saturation: Many altcoins have struggled to maintain investor interest due to oversaturation in the market, with only a select few showing promise. Why Is It Not a Traditional Altcoin Season? A “traditional altcoin season” typically occurs when Bitcoin’s dominance declines significantly, and the majority of altcoins experience widespread growth. However, this cycle appears different. According to Ki Young Ju, liquidity is flowing selectively to specific altcoins rather than spreading across the board. Some potential reasons include: Regulatory Pressure: Many altcoins face scrutiny from regulators, creating uncertainty for investors. Shift in Market Sentiment: Investors are favoring utility-driven projects over speculative tokens. Market Consolidation: The crypto market is maturing, leading to consolidation around proven assets like Bitcoin and select altcoins with strong fundamentals. Key Altcoins Benefiting From the Current Dynamics While the overall altcoin market is subdued, some tokens have managed to attract significant liquidity. Ju referred to this selective growth as “{your_outperformed_alt} season,” implying that the winners in this cycle are few but impactful. Among the notable performers are: Ethereum (ETH): With its robust DeFi ecosystem, Ethereum continues to draw attention from institutional and retail investors. Solana (SOL): Known for its high-speed transactions and developer-friendly environment, Solana has seen a resurgence in interest. Polygon (MATIC): As a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, Polygon remains a top choice for projects seeking scalability. Market Outlook: Bitcoin’s Next Moves As Bitcoin dominance rebounds, it raises questions about its next trajectory. Analysts suggest the following possibilities: Further Recovery: If Bitcoin continues to attract institutional investment, its dominance could strengthen further. New All-Time Highs: Positive macroeconomic trends and increased adoption might push Bitcoin towards new price milestones. Potential Consolidation: A stable dominance level could signal market consolidation, benefiting both Bitcoin and select altcoins. Implications for Investors For crypto investors, the current market dynamics offer valuable insights: Focus on Fundamentals: Given the selective nature of liquidity flows, investors should prioritize projects with strong use cases and proven track records. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin remains a safe bet, diversification into promising altcoins can provide opportunities for growth. Stay Informed: Regular updates from reliable sources like CryptoQuant can help investors navigate the evolving landscape. Conclusion Bitcoin dominance is making a recovery after a recent dip, signaling resilience in the face of market volatility. However, this recovery does not signify a traditional altcoin season, as highlighted by CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju. Instead, a few select altcoins are leading the charge, reflecting a more targeted flow of liquidity. For investors, understanding these shifts is crucial for making informed decisions. As the crypto market continues to mature, Bitcoin’s role as the cornerstone of the ecosystem remains unshaken, while opportunities in altcoins require careful consideration.

37914898,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375627,1734768460,"Is Crypto the Ultimate Mirror of Emotions Like Greed, Fear, and Hope?","The cryptocurrency community witnessed one of its most volatile and challenging weeks in recent history. Bitcoin, for example, went from $100,000 last Saturday to over $108,000 by Tuesday to reach a new record but then dumped by $16,000 to a multi-week low of $92,000 after the Fed’s hawkish comments for 2025. It has recovered about seven grand since then and is now close to $100,000 once again. Aside from causing billions of dollars worth of liquidations from over-leveraged traders, these enhanced fluctuations played with a lot of people’s emotions, with many speculating whether the bull cycle has ended. The Fear and Greed Index, a metric showing the overall sentiment in the crypto market toward BTC and the altcoins, went from deep ‘extreme greed’ of 87 down to just ‘greed’ – 73 in a couple of days. Such large differences only go to show the emotional part of the ever-volatile crypto market. Zooming out a bit, though, and it’s about perspective. Fear and Greed 7-Day. Source: Alternative.me The Emotional Part It’s obvious that we cannot exclude emotions from anything; otherwise, we wouldn’t be humans. The financial markets are no different, especially crypto, due to its substantial price fluctuations. One cannot just shut down their emotions when they see their portfolio going up and especially down by double-digits within a day or two. Julian Hosp, Bake’s CEO, outlined the importance of emotions but also perspective in a recent X post during the correction. He believes the most vital part of people’s perspective is the direction and not the actual numbers. “Here’s the crazy thing about crypto: It doesn’t matter if Bitcoin is at 30k, 60k, or 100k – it’s all about the direction. Price goes up? Everyone’s euphoric: 90k to 100k? Amazing. 108k to 100k? Disaster. Same price, totally different vibes.” Let’s analyze what happens during those massive green or red candle periods. When BTC’s price surges toward a new all-time high, euphoria kicks in. Remember what happened back in 2021? Bitcoin jumped toward $70,000, and people put laser eyes on X (then Twitter) as they were focused on its price going to $100,000. And what happened next – BTC dumped and went into a year-long bear market. Fear dominated during that dark period, especially when previous industry giants like FTX and Celsius went bust. The landscape changed once again in 2023 when BlackRock filed for a spot in Bitcoin ETF, which essentially guaranteed that the US SEC would finally greenlight such products. The same happened when Donald Trump, who made numerous pro-crypto promises during his campaign, won the elections, and BTC started pumping. The asset indeed went into six-digit territory, and the aforementioned euphoria started to kick in. People celebrated when it hit $100,000, but it then tapped $108,000 and went back to $100,000 – this time, the overall sentiment was not all that bullish, even though it seemed impossible just two years ago to be at this level. Mirror of Emotions Hosp concluded that the crypto market is a “mirror of emotions: greed, feat, hope – it’s all about the feeling of where the market is heading.” He noted that the ultimate utility is the price itself, and rationality goes away when that price and trends “dominate over facts.” He added that large green candles “generate more hype than any actual numbers ever could.” We know it’s impossible to leave emotions at the door when dealing with finances, especially crypto. However, one should zoom out during such violent corrections as the one from this week and look at the bigger picture – is your portfolio better now than it was a few months/years ago? If yes, then keep calm and keep doing what you have been doing. If not, then you need to analyze what went wrong and how you can improve.

In a new thread, Tapiero tells his 123,500 followers on the social media platform X that once the US government tightens up fiscal policy, the top crypto asset by market cap will skyrocket. According to Tapiero, the Federal Reserve is too focused on inflation, and interest rates in the US are still too high. “Danger in China. Do people understand? The second-largest economy in [the] world DEFLATING now. Fed concerns on inflation wrong. Interest rates [are] still too high in [the] US and now fiscal policy will tighten, USD strengthen. Liquidity coming to drive… Bitcoin. $200,000 next year [is] doable.” Tapiero – the founder of crypto venture capital firm 10T Holdings – says that the total market cap of digital assets will make a move toward $10 trillion sometime this cycle. “Back in mid-2019, I thought [the total market cap of crypto] could hit $10 trillion. Hence the fund name. Many Bitcoiners claimed I was too conservative. They have been right. Total market cap of cryptocurrency will challenge $10 trillion this cycle. Unique asset in the history of value and finance.” In a recent post, best-selling finance author Robert Kiyosaki predicts that the crypto king could hit even further heights in 2025 and that its design enables latecomers to make money as well. “The beauty of Bitcoin’s design is [that] it is never too late to start, regardless of how high Bitcoin’s price goes. Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich, even those who start late. Just don’t get greedy… Bitcoin to $350,000 by 2025.” Bitcoin is trading for $97,082 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

XRP Has Been The Top Traded Altcoin On Binance This Month In a new CryptoQuant Quicktake post, community analyst Maartunn has talked about how the altcoins currently compare against each other based on their monthly Binance futures trading volumes. The “trading volume” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of a given asset that’s becoming involved in trading on a centralized exchange. In the context of the current topic, the platform is Binance. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the monthly value of this metric for various top altcoins in the sector. From the graph, it’s apparent that during most months of this year, Solana (SOL) dominated the trading volume on the exchange. A shift has occurred in the market during the past couple of months, however, as SOL has lost its number one spot. Last month, it was Dogecoin (DOGE) that managed to surpass the asset to become the number one altcoin in this metric, while this month, XRP has overtaken both of them. So far, XRP has seen trading volume amounting to $116.6 billion on the exchange. This value is also certain to go even higher, as this month of December still has one-third of the way to go. While Binance doesn’t make up for the entire sector, the exchange is still the largest in terms of volume, so the trend on there can be representative of the wider market. “It’s important to track the top-traded coins on Binance, as they should be your main focus when trading altcoins,” notes Maartunn. During the last couple of days, the entire cryptocurrency sector has witnessed a crash. Based on the monthly Binance volume, though, the analyst says, “XRP seems to be one that could recover quickly.” In some other news, the market plummet in the last 24 hours has meant that the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector has registered a massive amount of liquidations, according to data from CoinGlass. Out of the $1.40 billion liquidations that have occurred inside this window, XRP-related contracts seem to have contributed for around $42 million, as the below heatmap shows. Interestingly, Dogecoin and Solana appear to have seen a larger flush than XRP. This may be down to the fact that both of these assets have also witnessed a deeper price drawdown. XRP Price During the latest crash, XRP briefly slipped under the $2.0 level, but it seems the coin has managed to recover back above the mark for now as its price is trading around $2.1.

XRP (XRP) XRP is a digital currency supported by the XRP Ledger. It’s designed to be fast, low-cost, and open, making transactions across borders quick and easy. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with 100 billion coins. They gifted 80 billion to Ripple, a company aiming to enhance global payments. Ripple, originally called OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to boost network liquidity and support the ecosystem. To manage the coin’s supply, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP in escrow. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” highlighting its goal to make moving money as simple as sending information. In today’s crypto market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency. Transactions are processed in seconds without the need for a bank account, setting it apart from coins like Bitcoin, which can be slower and more expensive to transfer. XRP’s technology focuses on real-world applications, especially in cross-border payments. While the market can be unpredictable, XRP’s features and Ripple’s efforts to build partnerships might make it appealing to investors. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, XRP could be a strong contender in the push toward faster, more efficient digital transactions. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, known as SHIB, is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke but turned into something more. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator called Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many applications in the Ethereum world. SHIB began with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens! To build trust, half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum. Buterin donated a large amount of SHIB to India’s COVID relief fund and then “burned” 40% of the total supply. These actions put SHIB in the spotlight. Unlike other meme coins like Dogecoin, SHIB aims to be more than just a joke. Because it operates on Ethereum, it can do more interesting things. For example, SHIB has its own exchange called ShibaSwap. There are also plans for a platform for NFTs (digital art) and a system where users can vote on changes. This means SHIB could have real uses in the future. In today’s market, where people look for coins with real potential, SHIB might be an attractive choice. Its plans and technology could help it stand out in the crowded crypto space. Conclusion While XRP and SHIB hold promise, XYZVerse—with its unique sports-meme fusion and bold growth goals—could offer even greater returns by 2026.

At the same time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is racing to file its main brief before Chairman Gary Gensler steps down . However, a possible government shutdown could delay the process. Here’s what’s at stake. Key Deadlines for Both Parties The court has ordered Bradley Sostack to submit a Mediation Questionnaire by December 23, mirroring the SEC’s filing timeline. Following this, the court expects the Appeals Transcript Order by December 31, and the full transcript by January 30. These deadlines set the stage for the next steps in the case. Sostack is set to file his opening brief on March 6, 2025, where he will outline his claims against Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. Ripple Labs, XRP II, and Garlinghouse must respond by April 7, 2025. If either side misses these deadlines, the appeal could be dismissed. Ripple’s Legal Wins, but Sostack Presses Forward Despite recent favorable rulings for Ripple, Sostack is determined to move forward with his case. Judge Phyllis Hamilton recently approved a motion to amend the judgment and stay in the case. Both sides agreed there was no need to delay the judgment since the class claims had already been settled. However, the legal fight continues. Ripple vs. SEC drama could shape XRP’s future curious how it affects the price? Read XRP price prediction to stay ahead of the curve! SEC Prepares for Shutdown The SEC, also a key player in the Ripple lawsuit , is facing its own challenges. With a potential U.S. government shutdown on the horizon due to budget issues, the SEC may struggle to file its response on time. Some analysts suggest this could temporarily ease the pressure on Ripple, but any delay could push back a resolution, leaving the regulatory status of XRP unclear for longer. As Ripple fights on and the SEC faces hurdles, the path ahead remains anything but clear, leaving many wondering what the next chapter will bring. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37927451,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106057,1734766964,"Trading Mentor Commends XRP Resilience During Latest Market Crash, Says XRP is ‘Worth Monitoring’","Popular trading mentor Jacob Canfield commends XRP’s resilience during the latest crypto crash. The crypto market has recently witnessed one of its major sell-offs, wreaking havoc on the prices of top assets, especially altcoins. XRP was not spared in the latest downturn, as the asset gave up its third position to Tether (USDT). Canfield Commends XRP Resilience Despite plunging below the $2 mark yesterday, XRP rebounded nicely and currently hovers above $2.3. Interestingly, Canfield took to X to express admiration for the token’s resilience during the latest market bloodbath. “ I am very impressed with how well $XRP has held up ,” Canfield remarked in an X post yesterday. The trading mentor noted that he expected the price of XRP to remain below $2 while showing signs of ‘distribution vibes’, where large holders get to liquidate their position in the asset. However, he was surprised to see XRP trading above $2.3, characterizing this feat as ‘remarkable.’ Given XRP’s resilience in the latest market downturn, Canfield emphasized that XRP is ‘worth monitoring.’ XRP Showcases Strong Resilience Amid DownturnXRP’s recent performance has continued to stun many investors. Last week, CNBC described XRP as the biggest winner in the Donald Trump-led crypto rally, emphasizing that the coin spiked by 370% compared to the 93% gain witnessed across the broader crypto market. Specifically, the price of XRP soared from around $0.5 in early November to $2.86 on December 3. However, this was followed by a significant downturn, which plunged the price to $1.90 on December 10. Interestingly, XRP rebounded from this level, soaring to $2.71 a week later, thanks to the launch of Ripple RLUSD stablecoin. The rally was short-lived as XRP suffered another major plunge due to Bitcoin’s rollercoaster movement. This time, it dipped below the $2 mark yesterday, plunging to an intraday low of $1.97. Like last week, XRP bounced nicely yesterday, soaring above $2.3 a few hours later. XRP to Resume Uptrend Soon Commenting on the development, popular crypto analyst Charting Guy noted that XRP’s latest price movement aligns with a similar pattern from 2017. According to Charting Guy, yesterday’s low might mark the end of the recent downtrend before XRP resumes its uptrend by next weekend, potentially reaching a new all-time high (ATH) by January. https://twitter.com/ChartingGuy/status/1870244503442833829It bears mentioning that the previous all-time of $3.84 was registered on January 4, 2018. Whales Accumulate 80M XRP Amid Dip According to Ali Martinez, crypto whales, especially those holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP, took advantage of the recent dip to increase their XRP holdings. In particular, these investors accumulated 80 million XRP since the correction began on December 17. At the current price of $2.35, these 80 million XRP coins are worth $188 million. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1870215929298346348Currently, XRP is up 2.06% over the past 24 hours but down 5.73% in the past week.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/21/trading-mentor-commends-xrp-resilience-during-latest-market-crash-says-xrp-is-worth-monitoring/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=trading-mentor-commends-xrp-resilience-during-latest-market-crash-says-xrp-is-worth-monitoring,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

He showed that XRP is on the verge of closing a significant 3-day candle above $2.30, a development he described as a strong bullish signal. The analyst further projects that breaking this level could pave the way for XRP to target $2.62, a critical resistance zone. If XRP closes above $2.62, EGRAG CRYPTO believes it would confirm the full bullish formation and signal the start of the next upward run. #XRP – As Expected – Trust The Process: In just 6 hours, #XRP will close the 3-day candle hopefully above $2.3 – this is a strong bullish signal!

Nabiullina said the central bank was considering three options: keeping the interest rate steady, raising it to 22% or increasing it further to 23%. Ultimately, the board decided that keeping the interest rate steady was a stronger signal for the economy. “From a forward-looking policy perspective, the stronger signal was that credit growth was slowing,” Nabiullina said. If this trend is confirmed at the February meeting, it could indicate that the desired level of monetary tightening has been achieved, she added. Addressing concerns about the ruble's performance, Nabiullina reiterated that Russia maintains its floating exchange rate policy and does not aim to keep its currency at a certain level. Related News: The Decline Also Hit Donald Trump: All 6 Altcoins He Bought Suffered Major Decline “Our exchange rate is floating, we do not have a goal of keeping it at a certain level,” he said. However, he explained that currency interventions are made in case financial stability risks that the central bank does not currently foresee arise. Nabiullina reaffirmed the central bank’s cautious approach to cryptocurrencies, distinguishing between domestic and international use cases. “We continue to believe that cryptocurrencies should not be used as a means of domestic payment,” he said. However, while he supports projects involving cryptocurrencies for external payments, he expressed his absolute opposition to their use within Russia’s domestic financial system. Nabiullina also added that they do not plan to invest in cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

37914101,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52719,1734766240,"DOGE’s $1 Hype—Will It Deliver, or Will This New Altcoin Lead the Way?","Dogecoin started from scratch as a joke with no tangible utility. The coin still has zero utility and still represents a joke, but it has grown into a massive crypto project with millions of fans all over the world. Dogecoin has risen to an all-time high above $0.6, which is quite impressive for the kind of origin and utility it has. And for many years, DOGE holders have wondered if the coin would hit the elusive $1 landmark. Will it hit this price level or will a new altcoin like Rollblock do so first? Read on to find out. Positive Dogecoin news indicate better future for DOGE Dogecoin picked up some big fans over the years. One of its prominent proponents is Elon Musk, who has incessantly tweeted about it and even suggested that DOGE would be used as a payment method in his company. Even Dogecoin news from the Financial Times are answering questions on the possibilities of Dogecoin becoming the US currency. What if Donald Trump fires Federal Reserves chair Jay Powell and makes this suggestion a reality? In essence, Dogecoin has a lot of goodwill around it at the moment. That is why there are shouts that it could hit a landmark $1. If this happens, it would fetch DOGE holders really decent profits. But are there other coins that would fetch investors a bigger ROI? New altcoin Rollblock leads the way Rollblock is a crypto pioneer like Dogecoin , but it is leading the way in a different manner. This new altcoin combines blockchain technology with iGaming to create a transparent online casino where honest gambling and fair gaming takes priority. In essence, Rollblock is a place where anyone can play exciting games, have an unforgettable experience, win big and cash out without any hassles. Its dedication to user empowerment and trustworthy practices makes it the go-to platform for most gamblers. As a result, Rollblock is home to thousands of active users and the number will keep growing. This is quite impressive, as Rollblock is still in presale. Having a working product takes it ahead of most presales, and the fact that it is at the forefront of provably fair gaming sets it apart from other platforms in the GambleFi space. Savvy crypto investors acknowledge Rollblock’s potential and that’s why they’re rushing its presale in droves. Over $7.4 million has been raised in its ongoing presale with more than 10 million tokens sold. The token itself is available for $0.043 and based on its precedents, there’s a real possibility of hitting $1. The bottom line Only hype can push Dogecoin above $1 and that is a defect in itself. When that hype dies down or there’s negative market sentiment, Dogecoin tanks. That is why DOGE depreciated by over 20% in the last month after crypto market sentiments turned sour. Rollblock, on the other hand, is a utility token, so it isn’t really affected by hype. Its aim is to dominate the online gaming market, which is worth over half a trillion dollars at the moment. The new altcoin has the capacity to achieve this feat, but realizing just 1% of this ambition will push its price above $1 and fetch early investors enormous gains. This is why no one should miss out on it. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Kiyosaki Urges Investment in THESE 3 Assets appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Robert Kiyosaki, the renowned businessman and author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is sounding the alarm once again. In a recent post on X, he warned about the looming possibility of a global financial crisis and urged people to take action now. His advice? Invest in gold, silver, and Bitcoin to safeguard your wealth . But what has led Kiyosaki to this bold prediction? And why does he believe these assets are the key to financial security? Keep reading for the ‘ultimate blueprint’. Curious about Bitcoin’s latest moves? Read Bitcoin price prediction to stay ahead of the market trends! Save Yourself from the ‘Den of Thieves’ Kiyosaki didn’t hold back in his criticism of the US government, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve . He described the current financial system as a “Den of Thieves.” The 77-year-old businessman has long been critical of the system, but his concerns have become stronger in recent years. Kiyosaki points to key moments in history that led to his loss of trust in the US financial system. One turning point was in 1965 when the US replaced silver coins with cheaper alloys. Another significant moment was in 1971, when President Nixon took the US off the gold standard. Kiyosaki sees these actions as the start of the system’s decline. THANK YOU gold, silver and Bitcoin HODLERS: I do not trust the US Giverment, the US Treasury, or the FED. If you trust these Den of Thieves that is your choice. I stopped trusting my government in 1965, when I noticed our silver coins were now alloys of cooper. In 1971… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 21, 2024 The Case for Real Assets Kiyosaki has long dismissed fiat currency as “fake money” that only harms the public. He believes the government uses it to exploit people and strip away their wealth. His solution? Invest in real, tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. These, he argues, are reliable ways to preserve wealth in uncertain times. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Analysis: Here’s Why ETH Can’t Break the $4,000 Barrier , Key Message for Investors In recent interviews, Kiyosaki has emphasized the importance of financial education.

37913491,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375624,1734765452,Is XRP’s Bottom In? Ripple Explodes 20% From $1.96 Lows,"TL:DR; The entire cryptocurrency market went through a massive crash in the past few days, but Ripple’s cross-border token was among the poorest performers. Since then, though, XRP has gained roughly 20%, leading to the question of whether it has found its bottom. XRP Bounces Off The developments at the start of the business week couldn’t really foresee what would transpire just a few days later. On Monday, Ripple announced that its long-awaited stablecoin will finally see the light of day on the next day (December 17) after it was greenlighted by the NYDFS. XRP’s price reacted positively to both the announcement and the subsequent launch as its price skyrocketed from $2.35 to a multi-day peak of over $2.7 by Tuesday. After a minor retracement to $2.6, things went sour on Wednesday after the latest US FOMC meeting. XRP, alongside the rest of the market, plummeted to under $2.25, losing nearly 20% of its value in 36 hours. Although that was already a painful retracement, the landscape worsened on Thursday and Friday as the asset plunged to below $2 for just the third time since December 1. Thus, Ripple’s token had dumped by 28% from Tuesday to Friday, going from $2.72 to $1.96. The bulls finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow any further declines. Just the opposite, XRP bounced off and has gained about 20% since then, currently sitting at $2.35. According to popular X analyst Dark Defender, XRP “double tap on 4-hour charts for both on RSI and Price,” which, alongside the “tremendous bullish pin” on the daily chart, suggests that the asset has already bottomed and is ahead of more gains. XRP double tap on 4-hour charts for both on RSI and Price. Additionally daily frame has a tremendous bullish pin bar. These are initial signals for momentum to continue. Time will tell pic.twitter.com/85zgnzOhvC — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 20, 2024 It’s About Perspective During the lows, many crypto commentators started to speculate whether the overall bull cycle had ended. After all, the entire crypto market cap lost roughly $500 billion in just days at one point. However, Moon Lambo outlined a different view for those retracements, including XRP’s plunge. The YouTuber talked about having a perspective, as XRP, for instance, stood below $0.5 less than two months ago. Consequently, going from over $2.7 to under $2 is indeed painful, but looking at it on a broader scale, it still shows that the asset is a lot higher than it used to be just weeks ago. As someone who has been holding $XRP for over 7 years, while the price has been well under $1.00 for almost 100% of that time, and having never sold a single $XRP ever, I must say… I find it amusing that people are freaking out that $XRP *dropped* to $2.15. Bitch it was 49… pic.twitter.com/1FoohjdxUv — Moon Lambo (@MoonLamboio) December 20, 2024 The post Is XRP’s Bottom In?

Solana and its role in blockchain technology Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and hosting decentralized applications. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, powers the network by facilitating transactions, running programs, and rewarding contributors. Solana’s design supports fast processing without requiring sharding or extra layers, attracting developers and projects. This architecture makes it suitable for building high-activity solutions and innovative services. SOL has utility within the system, supporting various projects and acting as an incentive for participants. In the current market, SOL’s appeal depends on interest in scalable platforms and decentralized app growth. Its performance potential may draw attention from developers and investors seeking alternatives to other established blockchains. Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Cardano is a blockchain platform known for its focus on sustainability, scalability, and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for value storage, payments, and staking. Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake model called Ouroboros. The platform is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design improves speed and scalability. Cardano supports decentralized finance apps, token creation, and games, making it a competitor to Ethereum. Its unique setup allows secure and low-fee interactions. With high transaction potential and an environmentally friendly approach, ADA remains a strong contender in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Its technological advancements make it an appealing option in the current cycle. XRP: A digital currency for fast and borderless transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency created for quick, low-cost, and worldwide payments. It runs on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized system that ensures secure and irreversible transactions without requiring a bank account. Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz designed XRP with an initial supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple, the organization behind XRP, holds a significant portion and uses it for liquidity and ecosystem support. By operating without central control, XRP aims to simplify currency transfers and enable broader financial access. Its speed and scalability make it stand out in the cryptocurrency market. XRP’s performance in the current market depends on broader adoption and technological advancements driving its use case. BNB: Key cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem BNB is the main cryptocurrency of Binance, launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token. It now operates on the Binance Chain and Smart Chain, supporting smart contracts and various transactions. It is used to pay fees, issue tokens, and transfer assets. Users get discounts on Binance and access to third-party services. Its supply is reduced quarterly through burning, aiming to decrease the original 200 million supply by half. BNB’s integration into Binance’s ecosystem and its utility in multiple areas make it appealing. Its role in smart contracts, staking rewards, and fee discounts adds value. The overall demand for Binance services influences its market appeal. Evaluation depends on market timing and broader cryptocurrency trends. Conclusion SOL, ADA, XRP, and BNB show modest short-term potential but may gain over time. However, DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for those chasing unparalleled success. With an expected 700% presale surge and ties to the success of tokens like BONK, it aims to dominate. DOGEN offers exclusive rewards and builds a community of leaders seeking true market impact.

In a Friday tweet , the exchange boldly stated that XRP will make history in the crypto market by 2025. The tweet from Bitstamp quickly went viral in the crypto community, with the XRP Army cheering in support of the promising outlook.Although Bitstamp did not explicitly specify the achievement it hopes XRP will attain by 2025, the most likely guess is related to its price. Aside from price, other milestones expected in 2025 related to XRP include the conclusion of Ripple's lawsuit and the launch of ETFs .XRP Historic Price by 2025XRP has been trading below its all-time high for seven years. It last reached a peak value of $3.84 in January 2018 before tanking to $0.1151 by March 2020. This represented an astonishing loss of 97%, which occurred even before the XRP lawsuit. Since this low of $0.1151, XRP has soared by 2,420% over the last four years to reach its most recent multi-year high of $2.90 on December 3, 2024. However, the value of XRP has retraced slightly and is now trading at $2.37. At this price, it is trading 38.69% below its all-time high.Meanwhile, popular projections, like the latest one coming from Bitstamp, suggest that XRP will finally make history in 2025. For context, XRP only needs to rise by 62% to reclaim its 2018 all-time high of $3.84. Further gains would mark a new chapter for XRP, an event the XRP Army eagerly awaits.Market commentators have offered multiple views on how high XRP could go by 2025. For some, a realistic all-time high for XRP is between $5 and $8, while for more optimistic analysts, double-digit values between $10 and $20 could be expected.However, some ambitious analysts believe values above $100 are attainable, though such projections have been wisely dismissed as speculative and wishful thinking.Caution for the XRP Army During XRP’s Historic RunCommenting on Bitstamp's projection, analyst JayDee expressed agreement that XRP will make history by 2025. However, he noted that the overwhelming majority of XRP holders may fail to capitalize on the promising market of 2025.Specifically, he believes 95% of holders will get ""rekt,"" suggesting that those expecting overly ambitious prices for XRP by 2025 may be left holding the bag after the dust from the historic run settles.https://twitter.com/jaydee_757/status/1870214062963081642",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/21/bitstamp-says-xrp-will-make-history-next-year/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitstamp-says-xrp-will-make-history-next-year,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Dogecoin has shown strong recovery signs after a substantial correction yesterday. The doggy-themed meme coin bounced from an over six-week low of $0.26216 on Dec. 20, closing above $0.31000.Furthermore, DOGE has continued its bullish momentum today, appreciating over 8% at press time to $0.345. Amid the bounce, a notable analyst, Dima James Potts, has provided his Dogecoin price target for this cycle.Analyst Says $10 is Dogecoin’s Minimum Price TargetPotts acknowledged the crypto market’s cyclical paradigm, noting that Bitcoin and major digital assets tend to trounce their previous cycle’s highs in the fourth year of each bull run. With the analogy, the analyst predicted that Dogecoin would soon surpass its all-time high of $0.73995.Furthermore, Potts stated that Dogecoin has outperformed its third-year performance in the last two bull cycles. For context, Dogecoin surged 72.37% in 2016 and 114.86% in 2020 but has appreciated by an impressive 282.67% this year.Meanwhile, the commentary shows the analyst expects Dogecoin to close at around $0.31 this year before pushing to at least $10 next year. Notably, $10 is Potts’ base case prediction for 2025, as his chart shows the meme coin can reach $80 per coin, an extremely ambitious target. Dogecoin Chart per Potts Timeline for Dogecoin to $10Concurrently, Potts provided a timeline for Dogecoin to reach the $10 target. According to his tweet today, the leading meme coin will attain this price level between February 11 and May 7, 2025.The analyst suggested that Bitcoin might see multiple cycle tops next year. However, Dogecoin will peak on the premier asset’s first top within the date range.Meanwhile, Potts speculated that growing adoption and technological advancement will drive Dogecoin’s rally next year. Notably, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap gained traction in November, as the establishment of the D.O.G.E . (Department of Government Efficiency) spurred attention.Other Dogecoin to $10 PredictionsAdditionally, Potts is not the only analyst speculating a Dogecoin surge to $10; other analysts have made similar calls. For instance, seasoned market analyst Ali Marinez asserted that Dogecoin will hit $10, citing a rally to the tip of its ascending triangle.Meanwhile, Changelly and ChatGPT also predicted that Dogecoin will reach $10.

37913032,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666044,1734764447,Bitcoin Drops Below $98K—Is This the Perfect Buying Opportunity for Investors?,"Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently experienced a significant and sudden price correction, sparking debate among investors. Concerns have surfaced about whether this downturn signals the conclusion of the current bull cycle or merely represents a temporary setback. While short-term holders face losses, long-term metrics provide a broader perspective on Bitcoin’s trajectory, as analyzed by CryptoQuant’s Avocado Onchain in a recent report. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Reclaims $100,000, Warning Signs Emerge from Long-Term Investors Opportunity Or End of The Bull Cycle? According to Avocado Onchain, the realized price for investors who entered the market during Bitcoin’s recent peak at $98,000 places them in a loss-making position. However, for those who invested between one to three months ago, the realized price is significantly lower at $71,000, offering a cushion against the current correction. Avocado pointed out that historical patterns from Bitcoin’s 2021 bull cycle reveal similar alternations between record highs and sharp corrections, suggesting that these dips may not necessarily indicate the end of the cycle. Instead, they have historically been “opportunities” for market rebalancing and subsequent growth. A key indicator analyzed is the 30-day moving average of the short-term SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio). This metric tracks whether recent market participants are selling at a profit or a loss. The current SOPR data reveals that recent short-term inflows into Bitcoin have yet to result in substantial profit-taking. Unlike previous cycle peaks characterized by aggressive selling, the ongoing correction appears subdued, indicating that the market may still have room for upward movement. Bitcoin Short-Term Dips vs. Long-Term Trends Additionally, Avocado Onchain highlights the importance of distinguishing between short-term corrections and broader cycle trends. Bitcoin’s tendency to rebound after corrections in past bull cycles reinforces the notion that the current downturn might not mark the cycle’s end. These insights align with the behaviour of long-term holders, who often use corrections to consolidate their positions, strengthening market resilience. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In For This Cycle? On-Chain Signals You Need To Know Avocado concluded the analysis, noting: For investors who have yet to enter the market, this may be an excellent opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a discount. Instead of succumbing to panic selling during short-term downturns, adopting a long-term perspective and a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy could be a more effective approach. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is seeing a gradual rebound in its price surging by 1.3% in the past 1 hour. Regardless, the asset still appears to be overshadowed by the bears as BTC remains down by 3.5% in the past day and 10.5% from its peak of $108,135 recorded last week.

Sui (SUI) Sui is a groundbreaking blockchain platform designed for global adoption. It offers a secure, powerful, and scalable environment for developers. At its core, Sui uses a novel object-centric data model and the secure Move programming language. This innovative approach addresses inefficiencies found in other blockchain systems. By focusing on user experience, Sui removes common barriers in blockchain interactions. Features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make Web3 applications more accessible and friendly. Sui’s potential lies in its strong technical foundation and commitment to usability. By simplifying blockchain interactions, it stands out in a crowded market. Compared to other platforms, Sui’s focus on the end user could give it an edge. In the current market, there is a demand for user-friendly and scalable solutions. While many coins compete on technology alone, Sui combines this with a dedication to accessibility. This approach may position it well as the blockchain space continues to evolve. Considering market trends, platforms like Sui that prioritize both innovation and user experience may attract more attention. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum that pays tribute to the famous Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. It’s a deflationary memecoin with a catchy theme and a straightforward approach. Unlike other complicated projects, PEPE embraces its meme roots and keeps things pure and simple. There’s no utility promised, and the team is upfront about it. They appeal to the crypto community by having no transaction taxes and focusing purely on being a fun and engaging token. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw an explosive surge that pushed its market cap to a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive gains, turning some into millionaires overnight. This surge sparked what many call a “memecoin season,” with other meme-based tokens experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes plans to get listed on major exchanges and aims for a “meme takeover.” While it’s uncertain if PEPE and other memecoins will reach new highs, many in the crypto community are hopeful, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. In a market where memes can drive value, PEPE stands out as an attractive coin for those looking to ride the next big wave. Conclusion SUI and PEPE are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) leads as a sports-themed memecoin uniting fans, aiming for massive growth and blending meme culture with sports enthusiasm.

37914098,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52785,1734764297,"RLUSD Price Hits $1,200 Per Token: Ripple CTO Explains Why","Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin experienced an unexpected pre-launch valuation of $1,200 per coin, sparking widespread discussion within the XRP community. Ripple CTO David Schwartz addressed the situation, attributing the pricing anomaly to economic factors related to supply and demand. RLUSD’s Launch and Early Impact RLUSD officially debuted on December 17 as a native stablecoin on the XRP Ledger network. Its release generated excitement among XRP holders, briefly sending its price above $2.70. However, in the days leading up to its launch, some wallets reported irregular valuations for the stablecoin, far exceeding its intended $1 peg. Screenshots shared on social media, including X, highlighted RLUSD being priced at 511.20 XRP on the Xaman wallet, equating to approximately $1,200. This abnormal valuation was particularly striking, given RLUSD’s classification as a stablecoin designed to maintain a fixed value. Community Reactions and Speculation The unusual pricing attracted significant attention from the community. Some users speculated that the inflated stablecoin’s value could drive XRP’s market price. Questions were raised about whether this valuation trend would persist until the stablecoin’s official release. One community member confirmed observing the elevated pricing and expressed optimism about its potential impact on XRP. Such sentiments underscored growing anticipation around the stablecoin and its possible role in shaping the broader ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple CTO Explains Price Spike In response to concerns, Ripple CTO David Schwartz provided insights into the price surge, citing basic economic principles. According to Schwartz, the pre-launch valuation spike was primarily driven by the limited supply of the coin combined with high demand. He explained that the XRPL system adjusts valuations based on the highest buy orders. In this case, a buyer willing to pay $1,200 for one RLUSD caused the system to reflect that price. Schwartz emphasized that such discrepancies are expected in the early stages of issuance but assured that market dynamics would stabilize as RLUSD’s supply increases over time. Costly Pre-Launch Trades It’s worth noting that some traders experienced significant losses during the price volatility. A user swapped 10,000 XRP for 100 RLUSD before the stablecoin’s official market debut. The token was trading at approximately $2.71 at the time, meaning the trader effectively paid $271 per RLUSD. Once the stablecoin launched and reverted to its $1 peg, the trader’s $27,100 investment dropped to just $100. Since its launch, RLUSD has settled closer to its intended valuation. As of now, CoinMarketCap reports that the stablecoin is trading at $1, with a total supply of 53.1 million. This stabilization aligns with Schwartz’s prediction, alleviating concerns over the extreme pre-launch fluctuations. The RLUSD rollout has highlighted the complexities of introducing new digital assets, particularly stablecoins, on blockchain networks. While the pre-launch pricing anomaly drew criticism and financial losses for some, the stablecoin appears to have achieved its intended function of maintaining a stable value. Ripple’s focus will likely shift to optimizing the stablecoin’s performance and utility within the ecosystem.

37927448,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106049,1734763868,Here are 7 Events That Could Potentially Lead to Exponential XRP Upsurge,"As market commentators expect further XRP upsurge, seven events are capable of supporting this anticipated price uptick. Notably, XRP has performed exceptionally well over the past seven weeks, soaring 283% in November and sustaining gains in December despite the latest broader market correction that has pushed it to the lower end of the $2 mark. XRP now trades for $2.35, up 3.23% this morning, but down by more than 5% over the past seven days. Amid the ongoing pullback, analysts believe XRP's upward push is still at its infancy. Here are seven key events could further propel XRP's value once the uptrend resumes:Launch of RLUSDRipple introduced RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, on December 17, 2024. Ripple announced exchange partners like Bitso, Uphold, CoinMENA, MoonPay, and Archax, with plans for broader distribution. This stablecoin, fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents, aims to provide stability and liquidity within the market. The launch already positively impacted XRP's price, catalyzing a surge to $2.7.However, XRP has since corrected these gains amid the ongoing broader market pullback. While the RLUSD stablecoin might not directly impact XRP price in the future, Ripple CTO David Schwartz confirmed it could bolster liquidity, supporting price action.Resolution of Ripple's Legal Battle with the SECThe Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has lingered for four years. The most recent development saw District Judge Analisa Torres reduce the penalty against Ripple to $125 million, significantly less than the SEC's initial $2 billion demand. The SEC has filed a notice of appeal, indicating ongoing legal proceedings. However, some believe the forthcoming SEC leadership could throw away the case. A definitive resolution could remove regulatory uncertainties, potentially boosting XRP's market position. Approval of an XRP ETFWhile the SEC has approved multiple Bitcoin ETFs, XRP-focused ETFs remain pending. Firms like Bitwise, Canary Capital, WisdomTree and 21Shares have filed for spot XRP ETFs, awaiting regulatory approval. Notably, the approval of an XRP ETF could attract institutional investment, further enhancing liquidity and market confidence. Onset of Altcoin SeasonAltcoin season refers to a period when altcoins like XRP outperform Bitcoin. Market data suggests that a significant number of top altcoins have recently outperformed Bitcoin, signaling the onset of an altcoin season. During such periods, assets such XRP often experience substantial price increases due to heightened investor interest and capital inflows. Market veteran Michaël van de Poppe has repeatedly teased the forthcoming alt season for this cycle.https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1866162139809140847Departure of SEC Chair Gary GenslerGary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, is set to resign on January 20, 2025. His tenure has been marked by stringent regulatory actions toward cryptocurrencies. His departure could lead to a shift in the SEC's approach to crypto regulation, potentially fostering a more favorable environment for crypto assets like XRP. Trump has picked pro-crypto Paul Atkins as his replacement.Inauguration of President Donald TrumpPresident-elect Donald Trump, who has been a vocal support of the crypto industry, is scheduled to be inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States on January 20, 2025. Ripple plans to contribute $5 million to the inauguration.Industry leaders expect Trump's administration to adopt a more crypto-friendly stance, which could lead to regulatory clarity and policies that support the growth of crypto assets, positively influencing XRP.Establishment of Clearer Global Crypto RegulationsGlobally, efforts are underway to create comprehensive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. In 2024, countries like Australia, the UK, Brazil, and South Korea have announced plans to introduce new regulations to provide clarity and protect investors. Such developments can bolster market stability and encourage institutional participation, potentially benefiting XRP.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/21/here-are-7-events-that-could-potentially-lead-to-exponential-xrp-upsurge/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-7-events-that-could-potentially-lead-to-exponential-xrp-upsurge,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37912774,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395901,1734763859,"Could Bitcoin Make the US $81 Trillion Richer? Saylor Says Yes, Critics Say No","The post Could Bitcoin Make the US $81 Trillion Richer? Saylor Says Yes, Critics Say No appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, has proposed a daring strategy: adopting Bitcoin as a national reserve to potentially generate up to $81 trillion for the U.S. Treasury. He argues this move could secure the U.S.’s position as a leader in the global digital economy. With supporters hailing it as visionary and critics calling it reckless, Saylor’s proposal has reignited the debate over Bitcoin’s role in the future of finance. What makes this plan so polarizing? Let’s break it down. Bitcoin as a National Reserve: Saylor’s Vision Saylor believes that using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve could reshape the U.S. economy. He suggests this approach would: Strengthen the U.S. dollar, Reduce the national debt, and Boost economic growth by unlocking trillions of dollars in value. According to him, Bitcoin’s scarcity and growing global adoption make it a valuable asset. He also predicts that the global digital capital market could grow from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with the U.S. capturing a significant portion of this growth. Trillions in Treasury Revenue? Saylor estimates that adopting a Bitcoin reserve could bring in $16 trillion to $81 trillion for the U.S. Treasury. He even suggests Bitcoin’s price could soar to $500,000 if this policy is implemented, creating major opportunities for U.S. businesses and investors. Wondering where Bitcoin is headed? Read Bitcoin price prediction to stay ahead of the market trends! Critics Push Back While Saylor’s vision has its supporters, it has also faced strong criticism. Economist and long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff called the proposal “complete bullshit, ” claiming it would harm the U.S. economy. This is complete bullshit. The proposal would do the opposite. It would weaken the dollar, exacerbate the national debt, and making America a laughing stock. It would deprive business of power, diminish growth, and destroy value. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2024 Schiff argued that adopting Bitcoin as a national reserve would weaken the dollar, increase national debt, and destabilize the economy. “This would deprive businesses of power, reduce growth, and destroy value.” He has long criticized Bitcoin as too volatile and unreliable for such a role, advocating instead for gold, which he considers a safer and more stable investment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction Today: Bears Target $82,500 After Market Bloodbath , It’s A Bold Idea – Will It Ever Become a Reality?

37912615,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631316,1734763448,SEC hits Jump Trading with $123m fine over TerraUSD scandal and Luna misconduct,"The SEC fined Tai Mo Shan Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Jump Crypto Holdings , $123 million for misleading investors about the stability of Terra USD, an alleged “algorithmic stablecoin” issued by Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. (Terraform). Tai Mo Shan is further charged with trading securities in unregistered transactions. The SEC established that the firm acted as a statutory underwriter on some of its offers and sales of LUNA, which was also issued by Terraform and sold as a security. SEC chair Gary Gensler said: “This case reminds us that, too many times in the crypto markets, we’ve seen significant investor losses due to fraud.” ~ Gary Gensler He stated that Tai Mo Shan’s illegal activities affected the entire crypto market, leading to serious investor losses. Gary stressed the need for market players to comply with security laws and avoid deceiving the public about investors’ security. Tai Mo Shan agreed to settle the fine TerraUSD worked at a constant $1 value through a web of mixed algorithms and trader motivations involving LUNA . However, when the network was strained and seemed to be breaking, Tai Mo Shan made huge purchases that helped to stabilize the coin. According to the SEC, the impression from Tai Mo’s purchase was that the algorithmic mechanism was working, yet it was a deceitful tactic. Tai Mo made the purchases around May 2021, when the value of TerraUSD dropped below the $1 peg. The firm was motivated to purchase more than $20 million from Terraform. Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay $73,452,756 in disgorgement, $12,916,153 in prejudgment interest, and a $36,726,378 civil penalty as part of the settlement. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Tai Mo Shan agreed to cease and desist from violating the registration and fraud provisions it violated. SEC reveals Jump Crypto’s involvement in TerraUSD collapse According to SEC’s court filings, Jump Crypto had an arrangement with Terraform to bolster TerraUSD and earned up to $1 billion in profit. Later, Terraform agreed to pay around $4.5 billion to settle a SEC lawsuit on its collapse. Terra’s collapse shook the crypto world, wiping out $40 billion in investor assets and stock. Luna Foundation established a ring of people as its guard, and among those people was Jump Crypto’s intern-turned-president Kanav Kariya. Luna Foundation Guard was responsible for overseeing TerraUSD’s reserve. The SEC’s case against Jump Trading was initiated during the crypto winter and finally settled.

Investors are also going all-in into Lunex (LNEX) , a new DeFi token handpicked by market pundits as the best crypto investment of 2025. Let’s examine why LNEX is expected to beat Cardano’s price hands down with an incredible presale performance. Analysts praise Lunex (LNEX) as the best crypto investment in DeFi The Lunex Network brings groundbreaking crypto trading solutions into the DeFi market. Featuring an innovative multichain bridge, this new non-custodial decentralized exchange brings together multiple blockchain networks, creating an all-in-one DeFi trading protocol. This cross-chain functionality enables seamless asset transfers across different blockchains, significantly reducing trading costs and transaction times. Traders and investors can now trade, swap, and transfer over 50,000+ crypto pairs across 40+ blockchains using the Lunex DEX. More impressively, a portion of the funds collected on the Lunex DeFi swapping dApp is allocated for investors’ rewards. The platform pays up to 18% APY to LNEX holders engaging in staking, making the asset a top crypto investment for DeFi degens seeking high ROI passive income streams. LNEX is also a solid investment option for growth investors. With the DeFi market tipped to continue growing exponentially, experts believe the Lunex crypto exchange is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising DeFi trading trends. Conservative predictions place LNEX presale returns at 18x, followed by staggering post-launch yields as the Lunex DEX develops into a multi-billion crypto exchange. Whales enter an accumulation spree as Cardano’s price drops Early December, the Cardano price was trading at $1.1, a slight pullback from its recent high of $1.32. Cardano whales have taken advantage of the price decrease to solidify their positions, scooping over 80 million ADA in the past few days. The recent buying spree aligns with broader trends observed over the past weeks, where large-wallet holders poured nearly $300 million into ADA . That indicates investors’ confidence in the smart contracts platform and could fuel further price appreciation. Is ADA a good crypto investment ? Cardano’s price broke out in November and has delivered a nearly 5x return from its $0.27 August dip. Per CoinMarketCap, ADA has delivered a 70% return year to date and was up over 90% monthly. ADA ‘s community sentiment was over 90% bullish, indicating there could still be more progress in store for Cardano in the coming months. The altcoin is expected to trade in the $1-$1.2 zone through December, giving investors enough wiggle to double up before the next leg up. Per CoinCodex data, ADA is expected to trade in a channel between $1.13 and $5.83 in 2025 for a 400% potential ROI, making Cardano a good crypto investment for solid yields. ADA is good, but LNEX is great Crypto shrimps looking for staggering yields have scooped up over 2.28 billion LNEX as the Lunex ICO surpasses $5.3 million. The presale is already past 283%, with only about 1.7 billion tokens left up for grabs. Tokens are selling out fast at $0.0046, so race over to load up your LNEX bag today!

37912418,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52716,1734762605,Litecoin Takes Off with Volume Surge – Can NEAR or This New Crypto Challenge Its Momentum?,"Litecoin ( LTC ) surged into the spotlight with its latest price jump, fueled by a sharp rise in trading volume and miner activity. Meanwhile, NEAR Protocol and innovative new crypto Rollblock challenge its momentum. Both projects have unique strengths that are fascinating investors globally. Rollblock: A New Crypto Poised to Disrupt the Market Rollblock is a game-changing project, having already raised $7.4 million during its ongoing presale. It leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the online gaming industry and presents a unique value proposition that stands out in the crowded DeFi space. The platform offers seamless integration across over 7,000 games, live casino experiences and even sports betting, all secured by Ethereum-backed smart contracts that enhance transparency and security. Its innovative deflationary tokenomics system, which includes regular token buybacks, burns and staking rewards, reduces supply and incentivizes holding in the long term. Targeting the $500 billion global gaming industry, Rollblock provides tangible real-world applications that set it apart from competitors. Analysts highlight its potential to deliver substantial returns on investment (ROI), with some suggesting it could even outperform established projects like Litecoin and NEAR . Litecoin’s Momentum Builds on Miner Activity and ETF Buzz The performance of the Litecoin price has been nothing short of unimpressive. The token dropped 35% within just seven days, hitting a low of $90, buoyed by $18 million worth of LTC purchased by miners. These acquisitions, totaling 140,000 coins, reduced the supply of newly minted tokens entering circulation, driving demand and supporting upward momentum. The anticipation of a Litecoin ETF has only added to the excitement. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas recently identified Litecoin as a strong contender for ETF approval due to its regulatory clarity as a Bitcoin fork. Such an ETF could introduce significant institutional investment and push the Litecoin price toward $150. Technical indicators suggest that breaking resistance at $135 could trigger another rally, setting the stage for the Litecoin price to test new highs. NEAR Protocol Eyes $11 After 95% Price Surge NEAR Protocol has also been making waves, recovering from $3.50 to $6.83 in just three weeks—a staggering 95% gain. This V-shaped rally has been supported by strong buying pressure, resulting in a golden crossover between the 100-day and 200-day EMAs. Despite minor pullbacks, NEAR continues to demonstrate resilience, with its current resistance at $7.26 marking the next critical level to watch. Looking ahead, analysts are targeting $9.59 and $11 as potential price milestones for NEAR . The protocol’s innovative approach to decentralized applications and its robust technical indicators make it a strong candidate for further growth, even amid market volatility. Where to Focus? As Litecoin , NEAR , and Rollblock compete for investor attention, each presents a unique blend of opportunity and risk. Litecoin’s combination of strong miner support and the potential for ETF approval makes it an appealing choice for those seeking immediate market momentum. NEAR’s rapid recovery and robust technical indicators position it as a solid mid-term growth play, particularly for investors looking for consistent upward trends. However, new crypto Rollblock’s innovative approach and unmatched real-world utility firmly establish it as the standout option for long-term investment. It delivers practical applications and addresses tangible needs. It redefines expectations in DeFi and so positions itself as the project most likely to deliver sustained and significant returns.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-pepe-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37927447,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106045,1734761178,Ripple Pledges $5M in XRP to Donald Trump’s Inauguration,"Crypto companies, including Ripple, contribute millions to fund the inauguration celebrations of United States President-Elect Donald Trump. According to a FOX Business report , Ripple pledged to contribute $5 million worth of XRP to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee. This organization is responsible for funding the three-day inaugural celebration of Trump and his Vice JD Vance following their victory in last month’s presidential election. Notably, the activities, including dinners, parades, and galas, will occur before and after Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025. FOX Business claimed the company confirmed its contribution to the fund. Other Crypto Companies Donations Besides Ripple, other notable crypto companies have also donated heavily to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee. In particular, U.S. crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken donated $1 million each. Other crypto companies, such as MoonPay and Robinhood, have also promised to contribute to the fund. However, they did not reveal the exact amount of their upcoming contributions. Despite the contributions made by crypto outfits, their donations represent only a fraction of the $200 million the fund has raised so far. Interestingly, a source close to the fund expressed confidence that the figure could spike to $225 million before January 20. Trump Wins Crypto Support Meanwhile, the contributions from crypto companies demonstrate the industry's growing confidence in Trump. According to FOX Business, the crypto industry has donated over $200 million in support of Trump throughout the election cycle. Ripple was among the major donors from the crypto industry, with its Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty contributing 624,000 XRP, worth $300,000 at the time, to a Super PAC supporting Trump. It should be recalled that Trump promised to provide lighter regulations for the industry compared to Biden’s approach to the sector. Since his reelection, Trump has made significant moves to keep to his campaign promises. This includes his appointment of several pro-crypto officials into his cabinet, including Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and David Sacks as the first White House AI & Crypto Czar. Given Trump’s support for crypto, investors are eager to see how the industry will evolve under his administration.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/21/ripple-pledges-5m-in-xrp-to-donald-trumps-inauguration/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ripple-pledges-5m-in-xrp-to-donald-trumps-inauguration,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37911406,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395857,1734760965,Bitcoin Stuck in Danger Zone: Will It Fall to $90K?,"The post Bitcoin Stuck in Danger Zone: Will It Fall to $90K? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is struggling to recover after a steep drop that saw its price hit $92,000 yesterday, just as predicted in our analysis . Despite a modest 5% rebound, the cryptocurrency remains in a danger zone. Investors and traders are left on the edge. Let’s break down the market metrics to see what’s happening and what could be next. Critical Bitcoin Levels Currently trading at $97,536, Bitcoin is attempting to climb higher but faces stiff resistance at the 200-day Moving Average (MA). While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has exited the oversold zone, the risk of a pullback still looms large. Without enough buying volume, the MA 200 could push the price back down. Previously, Bitcoin found support at $92,000, helped by the MA 50 on the daily chart. However, this time, that support may not be enough if selling pressure builds. Meanwhile, the Fear and Greed Index stands at 73, signaling moderate optimism, but overall sentiment remains bearish. Source : Coinglass Catch the Warning Signs Early The MACD histogram shows selling pressure is easing, but the Average Directional Index (ADX) has dropped to 33.62, which is concerning. Adding to the bearish outlook, the MA 20 has fallen below the MA 50 and MA 100, indicating weakness in the market trend. If Bitcoin consolidates further or drops slightly, the smallest moving average could dip below the highest, sparking panic among traders. This scenario might lead to prices falling to $90,000—or even lower. Liquidation Wave Hits Traders Hard Over the past 24 hours, 296,631 traders were liquidated, wiping $831.74 million from the market, according to Coinglass. Yesterday, this figure exceeded $1 billion. Long traders, in particular, have suffered heavy losses over the past four days as the market continued to decline. Source : Coinglass The liquidation map reveals that many traders are still placing high-leverage long bets on Bitcoin, with some using leverage as high as 100x. In a bearish market, these decisions highlight a lack of understanding of the risks involved. The map also shows high-leverage short trades, which can create sudden price spikes as the market moves to liquidate positions with poor risk management. This volatility is common in periods of uncertainty. Source : Coinglass What Bitcoin Needs to Recover For Bitcoin to regain stability, it must break above the MA 200. Doing so would reduce negative sentiment and encourage new investors to enter the market. However, this requires an increase in buying volume, which is currently lacking. A sudden spike could liquidate reckless short traders, providing temporary support, but a sustained recovery needs broader market participation. If Bitcoin remains stuck in this danger zone, it could drop to $90,000, triggering panic selling and further declines in altcoins. Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. While it shows signs of potential recovery, the risk of a deeper drop remains. Traders and investors should watch key levels like the MA 200 and monitor buying volume closely. For now, caution remains the best strategy.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-fails-to-rise-back-to-100k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37911340,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666138,1734760816,Is This The Bottom? Experts Weigh In On Bitcoin 13% Dip And Potential Recovery,"Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing its first seven-day decline in eight weeks, prompted by hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) that have led traders to sell off the asset, which has more than doubled in value this year. Bitcoin Rebounds To $97,500 After Historic ETF Outflow The market’s leading cryptocurrency saw a drop of as much as 5.3% to $92,149 on Friday, following a record high of just above $108,000 earlier in the week. Since then the Bitcoin price has recovered the $97,500 mark, down approximately 5% since Sunday. This downturn has also affected smaller cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), despite a generally positive performance in US equities. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Loses Momentum: Could A Drop To $75,000 Signal The Final Correction? The shift in sentiment is further highlighted by a significant outflow from US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in Bitcoin. On Thursday, these funds recorded a historic outflow of $680 million, ending a 15-day streak of inflows, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The heightened volatility in the crypto market follows a rally that began after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election on November 5. Analysts from QCP Capital have noted that positioning in the market had become “overly bullish,” leaving digital assets susceptible to fluctuations in the Federal Reserve’s tone regarding inflation control. With the US Federal Reserve signaling a potential slowdown in its easing measures with its chair’s Powell announcement on Wednesday, the focus is shifting to the pace at which traditional financial institutions adopt cryptocurrency. Historical Patterns Suggest Potential Rebound For BTC’s Price Hani Abuagla, a senior market analyst at XTB, stated in a recent note that the interplay of monetary policy, institutional adoption, and political developments suggests that Bitcoin will remain sensitive to both macroeconomic and crypto-specific catalysts through 2025. This sentiment is echoed by Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, who advised caution in the short term. Weston noted that while a collapse in price is not imminent, the momentum behind Bitcoin’s recent rally has diminished, indicating a shift in market control. Related Reading: XRP, Solana Among Altcoins Witnessing TD Buy Signal, Analyst Reveals Market expert Lark Davis on the other hand, weighed in on the current price action, reassuring investors that historical patterns could suggest a rebound in the coming days. The expert referenced December 2020, when Bitcoin experienced a 12% drop following a 77% rally in the preceding months but then surged from $17,000 to $41,000—a 136% increase—in just 23 days. Davis posits that a similar scenario may be unfolding now, with Bitcoin facing a 13% dip after a robust fourth quarter. While he acknowledges the possibility of an additional 10-15% correction, he remains optimistic about the potential for further upward movement in the cryptocurrency market.

37912415,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52783,1734760748,Analyst Shares Top XRP Investment Strategy Amid Market Downturn,"The cryptocurrency market faced significant turbulence following the Federal Reserve’s latest decision to cut interest rates by 0.25%. This announcement triggered sharp declines across major assets. XRP, in particular, saw its value drop by 6.75%, currently trading at $2.19. Federal Reserve’s Rate Cut and Market Reaction The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut the interest rates to stimulate economic growth but rather led to unexpected market volatility. Traditional and crypto markets experienced sharp declines, with the U.S. stock market losing $1.5 trillion. Cryptocurrency markets suffered $310 million in liquidations within a day, with XRP among the most affected assets. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, emphasized the central bank’s current position on cryptocurrency, stating that it has no intention of holding Bitcoin or altering its policies to accommodate such assets. These comments contributed to negative sentiment, raising concerns about regulatory uncertainty in the crypto space. Performance Amid the Market Decline XRP’s price collapse erased gains made after the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. After peaking at $2.72, XRP retraced to $2.23, marking a 17% decline within 24 hours. The asset initially recovered slightly, but is currently in a precarious position, with its trading value hovering around $2.19. Despite the recent downturn, cryptocurrency analyst Oscar Ramos suggested that the dip could present an opportunity for accumulation. In a recent video, Ramos highlighted the recurring nature of price corrections in the crypto market and encouraged investors to adopt long-term strategies rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. Ramos pointed to a similar price drop on December 10, when the token declined following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s interview on 60 Minutes. According to Ramos, the asset eventually rebounded. The analyst disclosed that he increased his XRP holdings during the latest drop, expressing optimism about the asset’s future. He emphasized the benefits of dollar-cost averaging and advised investors to remain focused on the long-term potential of the token rather than making decisions based on market panic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin as a Positive Development Ramos also highlighted the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as a potential driver of XRP’s long-term value. Monica Long, Ripple’s President, described RLUSD as part of Ripple’s commitment to regulatory-compliant stablecoin solutions. She noted the increasing demand for such assets and projected that the market for stablecoins could grow to $3 trillion by 2028. Ripple’s diversification efforts, including its focus on stablecoins, are seen by some analysts as a promising strategy for supporting the asset’s future growth. The token’s struggles are part of a larger downturn across the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin fell from $108,000 to $96,762, while Ethereum faced significant liquidations, including a $4.7 million transaction in ETH perpetual futures on Binance. Ramos urged investors to remain calm in the face of widespread market uncertainty. While fear dominated the market following the Federal Reserve’s announcement, he emphasized the importance of adhering to long-term investment plans rather than making emotionally driven decisions. While the market remains unstable, Ramos and other analysts see opportunities for investors willing to adopt disciplined strategies.

37910784,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112658,1734759507,How to Become a Millionaire in One Simple Step [Large Passive Income],"How to Become a Millionaire in One Simple Step [Large Passive Income] One simple step: start living the millionaire life. Since the advent of the Internet, cloud mining has gradually gained attention as a more convenient way to mine cryptocurrencies. Cloud mining allows users to participate in mining projects of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum by simply renting the computing power of cloud servers without having to purchase expensive mining machines and perform complex technical operations. Such projects have attracted many people who hope to get rich quickly. What is Cloud Mining? First of all, we need to understand what cloud mining is. Cloud mining is a way of mining cryptocurrencies through remote servers. It allows users to participate in cryptocurrency mining activities without owning and maintaining actual mining equipment. Users only need to purchase a certain amount of computing power through cloud mining platforms. These platforms provide corresponding mining machines and computing power. Users only need to monitor and manage their mining income through the interface provided by the platform. Users no longer need to deal with hardware failures, equipment maintenance or power consumption. All of these tasks are taken care of by CrytocoinMiner . How cloud mining works: Renting computing power: Users choose the CrytocoinMiner cloud mining platform and purchase one or more computing power contracts according to their needs. Computing power is usually measured in hash rate (Hash). The higher the hash rate, the more mining benefits. 2.Mining operation: The rented computing power is connected to the mining pool, which is a network that concentrates a large number of miners and improves mining efficiency through division of labor and cooperation. The user’s computing power participates in the calculation of the network to mine cryptocurrency. 3.Obtain income: CrytocoinMiner shares the daily interest rate income according to the computing power contract rented by the user. These income will be distributed to the user’s account regularly. Platform maintenance: CrytocoinMiner will be responsible for providing hardware, operation and maintenance, data center management, and handling electricity costs, etc. Users do not need to buy expensive mining machines, nor do they need to worry about equipment failure or maintenance. https://crytocoinminer.com/xml/index.html#/product What is CrytocoinMiner? This is a cloud mining company founded in 2018. They designed a simple and easy-to-use page so that experienced or inexperienced miners can quickly get started, which also quickly made their global membership exceed 3.7 million. They are an FCA-regulated company (FCA Regulation: Financial Services, Companies and Markets), and CrytocoinMiner treats consumers fairly. According to statistics, the company contributes about 4.5% of the global hash rate. The advantage of CrytocoinMiner is that it is easy to make profits instead of losses. Simplified operation: No technical background or expensive mining machines are required, and anyone can participate. Cost saving: Users do not need to invest in infrastructure such as electricity, mining machines, and cooling equipment. No worries: The platform will be responsible for the operation, management, and update of the mining machines, and users only need to focus on profits. Cryptocurrency fluctuates greatly, and you can earn money when it goes up and lose money when it goes down. Users can mine through crytocoinminer cloud to obtain stable tokens for sale or collection. The following are recommended projects for earning cryptocurrency: Example: Invest $10,000 to purchase $10,000 worth of BTC [Advanced Computing Power], with a contract term of 50 days and a contract daily interest rate of 1.75%. The amount of passive income you can get every day after purchase = $10,000*1.75%=$175. After 50 days, your principal and income = $10,000+$175*50=$10,000+$8,750=$18,750 (Different contract computing power values, different investment amounts and terms, and different incomes, please log in to the CrytocoinMiner official website to view more contracts) To sum up, anyone who participates in the CrytocoinMiner cloud mining project can obtain good passive income. Warm reminder: Since its launch, CrytocoinMiner’s innovative business has been imitated by some companies and even used to create scams. Please be careful to identify it.

In the background, the hot new crypto Rollblock is getting a lot of attention because it could deliver a superior ROI compared to its established competitors. Is RBLK the next big opportunity you shouldn’t miss? Rollblock is the Hot New Crypto with Game-Changing Potential Rollblock is a promising contender in the crypto space. Positioned at the intersection of DeFi and online gaming, Rollblock’s innovative GambleFi model offers a compelling mix of utility and profitability. It already raised over $7 million in its presale. Rollblock’s ecosystem is designed to support over 7,000 games, live casinos, and sports betting, leveraging Ethereum-based smart contracts to ensure transparency and security. What sets Rollblock apart is its deflationary tokenomics, which include regular token buybacks and burns to create scarcity. Investors also benefit from lucrative staking rewards, adding to the token’s appeal. Analysts view Rollblock’s unique approach as a significant advantage, with its projected growth aligned with the $740 billion online gaming market. Early investors in Rollblock’s presale , priced at just $0.043 per token, stand to gain substantial returns as the platform gains traction. Hedera Keeps Gaining Ground Hedera ( HBAR ) has seen a lot of growth, its value soaring over 200% since the start of November. This surge highlights the appeal of its hashgraph technology, which is celebrated for its unmatched speed, energy efficiency, and scalability. Hedera ’s governing council, including industry heavyweights like Google, IBM, and Boeing, further cements its reputation as a trustworthy and forward-thinking blockchain project. Market analysts predict Hedera could climb to $0.566 in the near term. Long-term projections extend even further, with some estimates stating it could reach $2.19 by 2030. Polkadot’s ROI Struggles Because of Persistent Challenges Polkadot was once a favorite in the market, but its price has declined to around $3.98. This is well below its ATH of $55 in 2021. The recent descending triangle pattern in its price chart signals bearish sentiment, with potential support levels at $3.88 and $3.50. Technical indicators suggest that DOT is not done with challenges. Some experts are even concerned it might get back to its launch price of $2.69. Despite these setbacks, Polkadot ’s underlying technology remains robust. Its unique parachain system enables interoperability across blockchains, a feature that could drive future adoption. However, for now, the project struggles to attract the level of investor confidence required for a significant rebound. The Case for High ROI in Emerging Cryptos Hedera ’s bullish momentum demonstrates the potential of innovative technologies to capture market attention. However, Rollblock’s GambleFi protocol offers a fresh angle, blending blockchain transparency with real-world utility in a high-growth industry. Meanwhile, Polkadot faces an uphill battle to reclaim its former glory. For investors seeking strong ROI , the key lies in identifying projects with clear use cases and robust tokenomics. Rollblock, with its presale success and industry-first features, appears well-positioned to outpace established players like Polkadot. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Rollblock’s innovative model may lead the next wave of investor interest. Discover more about Rollblock’s presale and its potential for explosive growth. Don’t miss the opportunity to join one of the hottest new cryptos in the market today. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

37910726,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52781,1734758732,Early Shiba Inu Investor Cashes In $9.5M During Recent SHIB Dip. Here’s how,"An early Shiba Inu investor sold nearly 400 billion tokens during the ongoing market downturn, earning a profit of $9.59 million. The transaction was shared by Lookonchain, a platform that tracks smart money movements. According to Lookonchain , the wallet involved in this transaction belongs to an investor who purchased the digital asset shortly after the project launched. On August 6, 2020, this user acquired 15.28 trillion SHIB for just $3,800, paying an average price of $0.000000000248 per token. By October 2021, when the token reached its all-time high, the value of these holdings surged to $1.22 billion. Since then, the investor has steadily sold portions of their holdings, significantly profiting from the asset’s price appreciation over time. Recent Shiba Inu (SHIB) Sale Details The latest sale, completed in several transactions, involved nearly 400 billion tokens transferred to the Gemini exchange. Data from Lookonchain indicates three initial transactions totaling 250 billion SHIB, broken down into 10 million, 99.98 billion, and 150 billion tokens. Shortly after these transactions, the investor transferred another 150 billion SHIB to the same exchange, bringing the total to approximately 399.99 billion tokens. With the asset trading at around $0.000024 at the time of the sale, the 400 billion tokens were valued at $9.6 million. This represents a staggering profit, as the investor acquired these tokens for just $99.19 in 2020. Etherscan data reveals that this user has also conducted other sales on exchanges like Crypto.com and Gemini in recent weeks. Despite these large sales, the wallet still holds a balance of 2 trillion tokens worth about $48 million. Market Conditions and Broader Trends The investor’s decision to sell comes amid a broader cryptocurrency market downturn, led by Bitcoin’s declining price. The asset has not been immune to the bearish trend, as its value dropped massively during the recent dip. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Amid this market volatility, many investors are converting riskier assets into stablecoins like USDT to protect their capital. In a related move, Lookonchain reported another significant transaction, where an investor moved 150 billion PEPE tokens, valued at $2.72 million, to Binance in response to the market decline. Investor Strategies Amid the Dip The user behind the PEPE transaction had previously purchased 150 billion PEPE tokens for $2.94 million and 60 billion SHIB worth $1.52 million on November 28. However, following the recent market drop, they incurred losses of $219,000 on their PEPE holdings and $136,000 on their SHIB investment. While the PEPE tokens were sold, the investor retained their 60 billion tokens, signaling potential confidence in a recovery for the token. This latest sale highlights the strategic moves of early investors during turbulent market conditions. While some continue to offload their holdings to lock in profits or mitigate losses, others remain confident in the asset’s long-term potential, even during the ongoing market challenges.

In a release on December 20, Metaplanet announced it has leveraged a debt instrument to buy more Bitcoin. It disclosed raising 5 billion yen ($32 million) through a bond offering to expand its holdings of the flagship cryptocurrency.Per the announcement, the latest offering is its 5th ordinary bond issuance. The Japanese firm noted that it offered the financial instrument to EVO FUNDS, who indicated interest following an announcement that it intends to raise another 5 billion yen in its just-concluded 4th ordinary bond issuance.Metaplanet Raises Zero-Interest Loan for Bitcoin PurchaseMeanwhile, the Japanese MicroStrategy disclosed that the $32 million raised today carries no interest rate. This means it will not share retributions from its Bitcoin purchase or pay APYs to EVO FUNDS.Furthermore, the loan repayment is due in six months, specifically June 2025. Metaplanet noted that EVO FUNDS will redeem the bond in full at 100 yen per 100 yen principal amount for each bond.According to the disclosure, the value of each bond is 250 million yen. Hence, the firm will redeem at the rate on the due date or with a written request stating its intention for early recompense.Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Play Yields ResultsSince adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve in May, Metaplanet has incessantly stacked the digital asset. Notably, the firm has raised $61 million through bond sales just this week to buy more Bitcoin.Meanwhile, the strategy fully mirrors MicroStrategy’s playbook.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-solana-memecoin-to-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37909727,https://nulltx.com/?p=136097,1734757307,CURVE DAO PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 21) – CRV Drops To Three-Week Low Following A 40% Correction In A 7 Days,"As altcoins continued to suffer losses amid the ongoing correction, CRV saw another 15% drop overnight to reach its lowest level in three weeks. It may appear weak, but its short-term bullish trajectory is still intact. The first and second weeks of December saw CRV’s price through a consolidation phase after failing to push above $1.34 earlier this month. Breaking down from that phase, it lost the key $1 level on Wednesday and closed with an engulfing bar. This triggered more sell-offs yesterday and the price further fell off the $0.8 level to a low of $0.735 today. There are no signs of recovery yet as supply becomes heavy in intraday trading. The bears are now targeting the $0.7 level. If this price level holds, we can expect a small relief in the selling pressure. If not, it may enter the $0.5 range before bouncing back stronger. Looking at the last three days of trading, which marked CRV’s biggest drops since the crypto started to correct lower, it seemed to have reached an oversold condition in the hourly timeframe, though there’s still room for selling in the daily timeframe. So far, the overall market condition has been horrible following a 40% loss in the past week. Nonetheless, there’s still hope for the long-term bulls. A drop below $0.2 could trigger a serious bearish sentiment. CRV’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The next target support for the bears right now is $0.577. If it breaks, the key support level to watch next would be $0.47. A broader correction could bring us back to $0.367 before initiating a fresh increase. A recovery from the current daily low could bring a retest at the flipped $0.88 and $105 levels. The higher resistance level for a break-up is $1.34. Key Resistance Levels: $0.88, $1.05, $1.34 Key Support Levels: $0.577, $0.47, $0.367 Spot Price: $0.736 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

37910725,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52725,1734757247,Web3Bay’s Presale to Deliver 6430% ROI – Eyes to Outstrip XRP & Tron’s Performance,"XRP, Tron, and Web3Bay are carving new paths in the cryptocurrency sector, each making distinctive strides. XRP’s surge of 20% to $0.83 signals a robust market confidence amid anticipated regulatory changes, including the speculated departure of SEC Chairman Gensler. On the other hand, Tron is solidifying its position with a stellar Q3, achieving revenues of $577 million and broadening its user network. However, Web3Bay steals the spotlight with its revolutionary approach to decentralized e-commerce. By eliminating middlemen and providing users governance rights via 3BAY tokens, Web3Bay is paving the way for the future of Web3 commerce. The presale, promising a massive 6430% ROI for initial backers, positions Web3Bay not just as another player in the crypto arena but as a trailblazer ready to lead. XRP’s Notable Uptick Amid Regulatory Changes Recently, XRP has experienced a significant uptick, gaining about 20% to reach $0.83. This increase is largely attributed to rumors of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s possible resignation, potentially fostering a more crypto-friendly regulatory landscape. This prospect has rejuvenated interest in Ripple’s native token, making it a strong candidate for an upcoming market surge. Furthermore, with platforms like Robinhood broadening their crypto offerings to include XRP, its market presence has strengthened, attracting more retail investors. Ripple’s continuous expansion in cross-border payment applications further supports XRP’s real-world utility. Increased on-chain activities on the XRP Ledger are also boosting investor optimism. Analysts believe that breaking the $0.85 resistance could lead to further gains, possibly reaching the $1 threshold. Tron’s Exceptional Market Performance & Expansion Tron is currently enjoying robust market momentum, recently peaking at $0.1914, buoyed by heightened trading volumes and revitalized investor interest after Bitcoin’s rally. With over 271 million accounts and 50 million transactions weekly, Tron’s growing ecosystem underscores its escalating adoption and influence. Financially, Tron has surpassed other major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, by recording a remarkable $577 million in revenue for Q3 2024. This achievement highlights Tron’s efficacy in generating stable revenue through its DeFi and dApp platforms, attracting both developers and users. Analysts are optimistic about TRX’s prospects, predicting it could soon test the $0.20 mark. 6430% ROI? Web3Bay’s Potential as the Year’s Major Crypto Venture Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape by challenging traditional intermediary-dependent models, shifting control back to users through a decentralized marketplace. This transformation is not only about cost savings but also about influencing the platform’s trajectory with governance rights provided by the 3BAY token. In an exciting offer for early investors, Web3Bay’s presale lists tokens at an initial $0.003. With a structured 28-stage price increase plan, the final stage could see token prices at $0.1959. For early investors, this means an ROI of 6430% at launch, marking it as a highly promising pre-2025 crypto investment. As blockchain technology becomes integral to various industries, Web3Bay is not just participating in the Web3 movement—it’s at the forefront. Imagine being part of a platform with the potential to rival major market players like Amazon, but where you have a stake in its development. Web3Bay represents more than just a project; it’s a community-driven revolution. Summing Up While XRP leverages upcoming regulatory changes and Tron excels through ecosystem expansion and record earnings, Web3Bay is setting new benchmarks in e-commerce by utilizing blockchain to give users complete control over their data and financial transactions, thus removing expensive intermediaries. The 3BAY token extends beyond functionality by offering governance rights, special rewards, and the opportunity for investors to influence the platform’s future. Starting at just $0.003 per token, its presale offers an extraordinary ROI of 6430%, presenting one of the most enticing investment opportunities in the crypto space.

37909637,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665821,1734757205,XRP Whales Loading Up – Data Reveals Buying Activity,"XRP has faced a sharp downturn over the past few days, shedding over 23% of its value since Tuesday. This steep correction has mirrored the broader market’s turbulence, intensifying negative sentiment around XRP. However, notable developments are emerging beneath the surface of this bearish price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals No Significant Panic Selling In The Market – Shakeout Or Trend Shift? Key on-chain data from Santiment reveals that whales are taking advantage of the dip. In the last 24 hours alone, these large holders have accumulated an additional 110 million XRP, demonstrating significant confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects. Historically, whale activity during negative sentiment often signals strategic positioning for future gains. This accumulation trend suggests that whales are undeterred by short-term price fluctuations, focusing instead on XRP’s potential in the coming months. As retail traders grow increasingly cautious amidst the recent drop, the actions of these large holders highlight a different perspective. While the immediate outlook for XRP remains uncertain, the notable whale activity is a bullish indicator for the long run. Whether this signals a bottom or simply positions XRP for a broader recovery remains to be seen, but it is clear that big players are looking beyond the current market turbulence. XRP Holding Key Levels XRP is currently trading 28% below its multi-year high of $2.90, but it has managed to stay above a critical support level at $1.90. This zone, regarded as the bulls’ last line of defense, has proven resilient amid recent market volatility. Holding above this level is essential to maintaining the bullish structure that has characterized XRP’s recent price action. Adding to the optimism, key metrics from Santiment, shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, reveal that XRP whales have accumulated actively during the pullback. Over the last 24 hours, these large holders have purchased an additional 110 million XRP, underscoring their confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Historically, whale activity during price dips often signals preparation for a recovery. The next step for XRP to regain momentum is to push above critical supply levels that have previously stalled upward moves. A breakout above these zones could trigger a swift rally, bringing XRP closer to its multi-year high. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details The strong support at $1.90 and continued whale accumulation suggest a positive outlook for the weeks ahead. However, maintaining current levels and overcoming resistance will be crucial for XRP to capitalize on this potential and reignite its bullish trajectory. Technical Levels To Watch XRP is trading at $2.06, reflecting a loss of momentum after failing to reclaim the crucial $2.60 level. This inability to push higher has left the market uncertain, with XRP holding above the critical $1.90 low. For now, these levels suggest the asset could enter a prolonged period of range-bound trading, oscillating between $1.90 and $2.60 in the coming days. However, market sentiment remains fragile, and this indecision could tilt toward the bearish side if the overall mood doesn’t improve. With XRP trading just above the psychologically significant $2 mark, a continued lack of bullish momentum might lead to a significant selloff. If bears take control, the lack of strong support below $2 could pave the way for a deeper correction, eroding recent gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck Between $99K And $102K – Analyst Explains Macro Situation For XRP to break free from this indecisive phase, a clear reclaim of the $2.60 level is necessary to restore confidence among bulls. Until then, traders and investors are likely to exercise caution, closely monitoring price movements and sentiment shifts to gauge the next directional move. Without a decisive breakout, the price may face mounting pressure, risking a more pronounced downturn if support at $1.90 fails.

37909685,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631310,1734756875,Solana Price Prediction: Lunex Gains Momentum as Solana Sets Ambitious Price Goals,"Recently, Solana entered a pivotal consolidation phase with a potential breakout. Meanwhile, Lunex, a new crypto project, is gaining traction. Lunex is a Web3 multi-chain bridge network that helps you instantly swap your assets between blockchains without having to trust any third party. Solana price predictions have sparked excitement, but understanding what’s driving the market is key. Similarly, Lunex presents the dynamics of how innovation defines the crypto sphere. It can demonstrate the opportunities in the rapidly developing sphere. Let’s break it down. Lunex: The new crypto redefining rewards and convenience Lunex hasn’t taken long to gain traction in the crypto market, and for good reason. As a new crypto project, it combines innovation with practical solutions for everyday users. Among the features, it is necessary to mention the Lunex crypto card, which can perform the conversion process from crypto to fiat instantly. The Lunex black card, which is available only to VIP presale clients, is only valid for 200 users and provides great benefits. This traction has also been driven by the Lunex presale, which has attracted a lot of attention. Hence, with the token price of $0.0046, it had been able to raise over $5.3 million. This strong support shows that people are developing trust in Lunex. For early adopters, it is a possibility to invest in a potentially successful project from scratch. Another reason for Lunex’s success is its tokenomics. All merchant and token listing fees are paid in $LNEX, making it a deflationary asset. This creates natural buying pressure, helping to maintain a stable floor price. It’s a system designed to benefit long-term holders while supporting the overall ecosystem. For those looking to earn passive income, Lunex staking is a game-changer. By holding $LNEX for just 30 days, you can earn up to 18% APY. Better yet, you can grow your staking portfolio without lowering your initial returns. Lunex isn’t just a new crypto—it’s building a comprehensive system that rewards its users. With its deflationary model, innovative card, and attractive staking options, it’s no wonder Lunex is gaining momentum. Solana price prediction: paving the way for a $315 breakout Solana is currently in a pivotal consolidation phase, which has traders and investors eyeing a potential breakout. A bullish flag pattern has emerged, signaling a possible surge in the asset’s value. Analysts suggest this accumulation period could push Solana’s price to $315, fueled by growing market confidence and strategic positioning. Such patterns often precede significant price hikes, aligning with positive Solana price predictions. The outflow of $112.29 million in SOL from exchanges shows rising demand for Solana. This shift to private wallets limits circulating supply, increasing demand and price potential. This investment behavior shows long-term trust in Solana’s ecosystem. Additionally, Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) recently rose by $618.4 million, reflecting increased activity across its protocols. These developments reinforce optimistic Solana price predictions, underscoring its strong momentum in the crypto market. Solana sets big goals, but Lunex is making waves – which will you bet on? When it comes to crypto, there’s room for everyone to shine. While Solana’s ambitious price prediction has its fans excited, Lunex is making waves with its innovative features and growing momentum. Whether you’re cheering for Solana or diving into Lunex, you’re part of a thrilling era for digital assets!

It currently appeared bearish on the day with no sign of halting correction at the time of writing. In the first week, Gala advanced bullish rally but later faced rejection after registering over 100% gain in November. This rejection led to a halt in the rally and the price traded calmly for the rest of that week. Earlier last week, it lost grip above the $0.06 level and nosedived into $0.04. The price recovered briefly from there and later stopped buying at $0.055 due to a rejection. It remains indecisive for three days and broke down steadily until it tested $0.032 today for the first time in a month. The price is approaching the $0.03 level that flipped during last month’s rally. Locating support above this key level could fuel a new buy order capable of bringing the bulls back on track. As of now, the bears are still in charge of the market on the daily scale. While the latest price correction is healthy for the market, we can expect a bounce back anytime soon. A deeper correction from the current price level could reset the market back to the $0.02 level before rising back. It is currently down 36% in the past week of trading. Gala’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As today turns out more volatile, the bears are now approaching $0.031. If they reclaim it, the $0.0263 support would be their next target. Lower supports considered for drops are $0.0216 and $0.017. Pushing back above the $0.0405 level, there’s a minor resistance at the $0.048 level. Reclaiming the $0.055 level could trigger a full recovery to the monthly $0.065 high before exploding to a new high.

This Exchange Token Looks Primed for 1,000% Gains While Ripple & Ethereum Face Challenges","The post Experts Say Don’t Miss the Next Big Thing! This Exchange Token Looks Primed for 1,000% Gains While Ripple & Ethereum Face Challenges appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) are seeing slight price dips at the moment. However, many analysts like Crypto Tony and Ali remain bullish on them. They have made some price predictions that have stunned the community. Meanwhile, experts are paying close attention to DTX Exchange (DTX) , a phase six presale phenomenon that may skyrocket by 1,000% in 2025. Since this altcoin has seen a 500% growth so far, this prediction has some merit. DTX Exchange (DTX) Skyrockets 500%, More Price Gains Ahead DTX Exchange (DTX) aims to revolutionize online trading while Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) experience hardships. This upcoming trading platform will launch in Q1 of 2025, combining the best features of CEX and DEX. On it, people will be able to trade over 120,000 asset classes, including FX and crypto. This will also come with a leverage of up to 1000x. Although people are excited about the DTX Exchange platform, its ecosystem will also include other products that have already been launched: VulcanX Blockchain: The testnet for this blockchain was launched and saw 100K TPS. Phoenix Wallet: A custody solution for crypto coins, stocks and more. CoinMarketCap Listing: The DTX native token, now in its presale, was listed on CoinMarketCap. Speaking of DTX, it will be the native token of this platform. Holding this altcoin will give traders governance voting rights, a portion of the trading fee revenue, and more. Currently, one DTX costs $0.12, which is a 500% growth from its starting price. However, this price will reach $0.14 after phase seven begins. Everybody is excited, as a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.20. With over 300K wallets already owning DTX, it is clear that this altcoin may become a fan favorite for fast returns. Ripple (XRP) Shows Red Price Charts, Analyst Remains Optimistic Ripple (XRP) is among the top 5 cryptocurrencies, but it has seen some price dips. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Ripple fell over 10% on the weekly chart. In that period, its value saw movement between around $2.30 and close to $2. Nevertheless, market analyst Crypto Tony excited traders with his Ripple price prediction. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin looks healthy and that a pullback is good. He set $3.80 for Ripple (XRP) as a price target. Although the Ripple crypto may see a rebound soon, experts think its highest upswings have passed. This altcoin has seen a surge of nearly 250% on the YTD chart. Therefore, many traders are looking at DTX Exchange for noteworthy gains instead. Ethereum (ETH) on a Downtrend, Ali With a Bold Price Prediction Ethereum (ETH) has also seen some red price charts in the past week. On the one-week chart, its value has sunk from around $3,900 to nearly $3,100. This is nearly a 20% drop in just seven days, as per CoinMarketCap. But traders still have faith in the Ethereum coin, and many analysts are making exciting price predictions. For example, prominent market analyst Ali thinks that after Ethereum (ETH) passes the $4,100 resistance level, it may reach $6,000. Although this Ethereum price prediction has made some headlines, it is worth noting that its market cap now sits at $373B. This means the Ethereum price will need a large influx of new money to skyrocket. On the other hand, DTX will not face this issue. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Outshine Ripple (XRP) & Ethereum (ETH)?

In a tweet on X, Steph highlighted that the Bollinger Bands for XRP on the 12-hour chart have started to tighten again. Historically, this technical setup has preceded significant price movements. The most recent example is the explosive 490% rally observed a few weeks ago.The Technical SetupThe popular Bollinger Bands indicator measures market volatility and provides key support and resistance levels. A ""squeeze"" occurs when the bands contract, signaling reduced volatility and often foreshadowing a major price movement.For XRP, the last time this indicator tightened on the 12-hour timeframe triggered a parabolic surge, elevating the token’s price from around $0.49 in the first week of November to $2.90 by the first week of December. XRP tightening Bollinger Bands by Steph XRP tightening Bollinger Bands by Steph Will History Repeat?Now, analyst Steph has noticed another Bollinger Bands squeeze on the 12-hour chart, speculating that another breakout may be imminent.Currently, XRP’s price is hovering around $2.26, consolidating after its recent bullish rally. Yesterday, XRP revisited lows around $2.17, coming close to breaking below the $2 psychological mark. Nevertheless, the observed tightening of the bands amid this price action suggests that market participants are anticipating the next major move.If the breakout follows a similar 490% rally as seen a few weeks ago, market participants could see XRP’s price rise as high as $13.33.However, while the prospect of history repeating itself is enticing, analysts like Steph are adopting a more conservative price outlook for XRP in the short term rather than targeting a lofty $13 . Some believe that $13 could represent the peak for XRP in this cycle.In the near term, market analysts are predicting a price rally to between $4 and $5 before another correction phase.Key Levels to WatchAmid the ongoing correction, analysts emphasize the importance of XRP maintaining support around the $2 level for a continued bull run. Casi Trade suggests two potential scenarios: a correction with support near the trendline or further bearish movement below it. She noted that holding the $1.90–$2.00 range is crucial for XRP's recovery.Market commentators like Chad Steingraber and IncomeSharks also highlight the potential for a rebound, with Steingraber seeing a ""double tap"" at $2 as a potential launch point for new highs. So far, in the latest market downturn, XRP has held above $2.On the other hand, some traders are watching critical resistance at $2.90, which could pave the way for further gains if breached.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/21/xrp-bollinger-bands-tighten-again-on-12h-chart-hinting-at-major-490-rally-to-13/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-bollinger-bands-tighten-again-on-12h-chart-hinting-at-major-490-rally-to-13,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without the need for intermediaries. By employing a system of parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions more efficiently than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The native token, DOT, is used for governance and staking within the network. Holders of DOT can participate in decision-making processes and contribute to transaction validation. Developed by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched on May 26, 2020. The protocol aims to create a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. Its technology addresses key limitations of existing blockchains, such as scalability and interoperability. In the current market cycle, Polkadot continues to develop its technology and expand its ecosystem. Its focus on interoperability and scalability addresses significant challenges in the blockchain industry. As the demand for cross-chain solutions grows, Polkadot’s role may become increasingly significant. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that may orphan blocks created in parallel, GHOSTDAG allows these blocks to coexist and orders them in the consensus. This approach results in a block directed acyclic graph (blockDAG) rather than a single chain. Kaspa aims for secure operation while achieving high block rates—currently one block per second—with goals to increase this to 10 blocks per second and eventually 100 blocks per second. Confirmation times are minimized and are primarily affected by internet latency. Kaspa includes features such as Reachability for querying the DAG’s topology and block data pruning, with plans for block header pruning. It supports Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs and is preparing for future subnetwork support to ease the implementation of layer 2 solutions. These technological advancements focus on enhancing scalability and speed in cryptocurrency transactions. In the current market cycle, Kaspa introduces a unique approach to consensus and blockchain structure that contributes to ongoing discussions about the evolution of blockchain technology. Conclusion DOT and KAS are strong, but XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a unique memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, aspiring to be the G.O.A.T in the current bull run.

37909091,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313644,1734756045,"No Middleman, No Problem? What 2025 Holds for Decentralized Exchanges","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post In 2024, DEXs (decentralized exchanges) snagged a greater portion of the crypto trading pie, demonstrating the future of finance is firmly headed toward decentralization. And Trump’s recent victory has only reinforced this trend, with Bitcoin’s price surging to nearly $91,000 . As monthly DEX trading volume soared above $250 billion in March and June 2024 for the first time since 2021, it’s clear that traders are increasingly opting for the benefits of autonomy and transparency these platforms offer. Over the past 12 months, several DEX platforms have refined their offerings to enhance the trading experience while prioritizing financial inclusivity and trust. This evolution indicates that the market is not just progressing – it has reached a level of maturity that some skeptics never anticipated. But these successes did not come without some hurdles. As 2025 approaches, 2024’s achievements and setbacks serve as a roadmap for where the market is heading. While no crystal ball can predict the future, one can assume that the steady shift from CEXs (centralized exchanges) to DEXs is just the beginning. DEX developments and challenges in 2024 This year, the DeFi (decentralized finance) landscape continued to grow significantly, particularly with the advancements in concentrated liquidity models. While these advancements enhance DeFi by providing greater capital efficiency and enabling users to concentrate liquidity in specific ranges, it’s no secret that this advancement was achieved at the expense of liquidity providers. On the governance front, 2024 saw the emergence of ‘DAO wars,’ where various DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) engaged in strategic maneuvers to assert dominance. These organizational rivalries add another layer of complexity to the DeFi ecosystem with DAOs fighting for control, leading to opportunities and risks for participants. As DAOs compete for influence, they have experimented with novel voting mechanisms, management strategies and community incentives to help attract and retain participants. This competitive environment has led to both innovation and volatility, with some DAOs forming alliances to strengthen their position, while others engage in aggressive tactics to undermine their rivals. In January 2024, a blockchain interoperability project launched a crypto bridge to allow a staked ETH token to move across multiple blockchains but did so without waiting for approval from the token’s governing body. This move sparked controversy, with critics accusing the project of overstepping its bounds and trying to lock in users ahead of its competitors. These challenges are especially significant because they expose the limitations and vulnerabilities of decentralized governance, specifically in areas like accountability and decision-making speed, further exposing cracks in the community. The rise of intent-based trading has also transformed the DeFi experience. These tools have invited users to implement sophisticated cross-chain strategies and facilitate wallet seeding, enhancing the overall multi-chain experience. This has streamlined functionality, allowing users to navigate DEX intricacies more efficiently without managing multiple networks. While we can’t know for sure what next year will bring, the past year can help guide DEX developers and users to anticipate what lies ahead. What to look out for in 2025 The rise of AI in trading strategies will likely enhance market dynamics, helping traders optimize their DEX performance. This integration has already taken off in the TradFi landscape, and as DeFi continues to see sustained growth, the technology’s inevitable integration will address challenges like limited liquidity, slippage and price manipulation. AI’s capabilities are certainly compelling. Its ability to predict price swings, identify arbitrage opportunities and mitigate risks will only improve with more data, making it a critical resource for DeFi and its participants. As DeFi protocols continue to evolve, its focus has shifted towards creating and utilizing aggregated assets to address long-standing liquidity and user experience issues. Aggregating liquidity from various sources similar to CEXs that accept deposits from different channels allows DEXs to offer more efficient trading experiences. For instance, protocols might allow users to deposit different stablecoins such as USDC into a unified liquidity pool, simplifying the user interface and expanding the trading pairs. This aggregation also improves the execution of the trades, reducing slippage and enhancing price discovery. However, as managing these complex assets becomes more difficult, so does the potential risk exposure across different types of assets. When multiple deposit types are integrated into a protocol, a single exploit in one of the bridges or smart contracts can ripple across the entire ecosystem. Ultimately, the vulnerabilities threaten a platform’s financial stability but also expose the ecosystem to larger systemic risks. Securing these aggregated assets will be one of the defining factors of growth and sustainability in 2025 and beyond. In regulation, up until now, the tax structuring for digital assets has been a poorly conceived policy, often resembling the taxation of unrealized gains in traditional markets. Under the Trump administration, the expectation is that taxes will be lowered and more nuanced in the US, leading to better relations between government agencies and decentralized organizations, and creating an environment that breeds opportunity and innovation rather than FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). While many crypto builders and activists believe Trump will ‘make crypto great again,’ only time can tell if that will actually happen. While the future remains uncertain, the challenges of 2024 can serve as a roadmap for the advancement of DEXs as we enter the new year. While DEXs have their imperfections, their advantages far outweigh the drawbacks, positioning DeFi for a promising surge in the market . In the coming year, expect DEX developers to deepen their commitment to crafting a better user experience, focusing on building long-term solutions that support the ongoing goals of DeFi.

37908935,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395836,1734755616,Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH to $20K? Whales Loading Up for a Massive Bull Run,"The post Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH to $20K? Whales Loading Up for a Massive Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is struggling to maintain a level above $4k, even in a bull run, but where can Ethereum go? Coincodex has the Ethereum price prediction at quite bullish, but a $20k mark seems a ways off. This begs the question of whether Ethereum is a good investment or if there are alternatives like Lunex Network to set the market on fire. Ethereum (ETH): The Road To 20k? The market had a red week in the second week of December as investors took a well-deserved profit off the massive November gains. One of the tokens that underperformed was Ethereum. While Solana and Bitcoin – and a host of others – reached their ATHs during the November bull run, Ethereum maxed out at a hair over $4k, still almost $900 short of its ATH. The Ethereum price prediction is relatively bullish, and Coincodex predicts ETH will break the $4k mark by the new year. Is this enough, though? The Ethereum price prediction is said to max out this cycle at just under $7k in November next year before falling to about $4,700. But what about the mythical $20k mark for the Ethereum price prediction? Coincodex says that is a long time off. 2033, to be exact. That will mark a 5x return for Ethereum. The Bitcoin price prediction for the same timeline is over $700k for a 7x return. The Ethereum price prediction says it’s not a great investment. Lunex Network (LNEX): A Rising Star For The Next Bull Run The cryptocurrency market thrives on cycles, and during a bull run, savvy investors seek out opportunities with massive growth potential. While major tokens like Ethereum grab headlines, the real gains often lie with emerging platforms like Lunex Network . Lunex Network is a next-generation Web3 decentralized exchange offering users unparalleled ease of use, security, and scalability. Though utilizing non-custodial wallets, Lunex eliminates the need to keep tokens in exchange, which ensures complete user control over assets. Sporting over 50,000 trading pairs across multiple blockchains, it’s firing a warning shot across the bow of established exchanges like BNB and Uniswap: Lunex is coming! Unlike larger tokens that often plateau during bull runs, Lunex Network offers exponential growth potential. Its innovative technology, which combines on-chain and off-chain elements, ensures lightning-fast transactions while maintaining the decentralized integrity that crypto enthusiasts demand. Leveraging features such as a liquidity aggregator and a robust staking program, Lunex positions itself as the disrupting force in the DeFi and crypto exchange ecosystem. For investors looking to maximize returns, Lunex Network represents an opportunity to participate in a project designed for long-term scalability and user-focused innovation. While giants like Ethereum promise steady progress, Lunex could redefine expectations during the next bull run. Conclusion Investing in crypto can be highly lucrative, and the appeal to established tokens like Ethereum is undeniable. However, these big guns are not necessarily the best tokens to invest in, even in a bull run. The Ethereum price prediction is bullish, but it’s not bullish enough considering the growth potential of tokens like Lunex Network. Smaller undervalued tokens like Lunex Network can return 100x – even more – at the same time it would take Ethereum to make a mere doubling of value. It’s worth adding Lunex Network to a well-balanced crypto portfolio. Lunex Network is now available at $0.0046.

This is why so many investors continue to allocate toward the huge disruption of the Rollblock ($RBLK) GambleFi presale, which experts predict will return 50x this year on the strength of its growing community casino platform. Rollblock ($RBLK) Momentum Already At Fever Pitch During Presale Rollblock ($RBLK) is an opportunity that doesn’t come along very often in crypto, as this blockchain-backed betting platform seeks to disrupt the $450 billion online gambling industry with its focus on trust and transparency. Rollblock offers a fully functioning Web3 casino that includes over 7000 games alongside a sports betting league that opens up the huge world of esports to Rollblock gamers. The Rollblock community is currently rallying around this recent update on the Rollblock Discord server, sharing wins and adding to the massive hype. Everything is fully encrypted onto the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that all transactions can be verified to ensure a transparent gaming experience. This gives players peace of mind and prevents the house from manipulating bets. The $RBLK token runs the entire ecosystem and rewards its holders with exclusive VIP benefits, free spins, and staking rewards with hassle-free yield of up to 30%. Regular buybacks from Rollblock will ensure a deflationary supply, as 60% of these purchases are burned while the remaining 40% is placed back in the hands of community stakers. This lucrative rewards scheme will mean that demand will far outstrip supply in 2025 and boost the price of $RBLK up to 50 times higher than its current level of $0.043. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) Airdrop Meets With Market Apathy The Pudgy Penguins token was recently launched as members of the Pudgy Penguins NFT community were airdropped large numbers of coins, along with crypto OGs from various chains, including Solana and Ethereum. The Pudgy Penguins NFT floor price rose steadily in anticipation of this airdrop but has since fallen by 40% as the Pedgy Penguins token has not rallied as expected. Pudgy Penguins is down by 26% to trade at $0.02. Nonetheless, analysts believe that Pudgy Penguins could take its place as a leading NFT token as it represents one of the most recognizable brands in crypto. Magic Eden ($ME) Quests Fail To Propel Token Price Magic Eden has also failed to follow its early promise, falling from $10 on its initial launch at the start of December to its current level of $2.85. Magic Eden offers NFT and crypto token trading and can be staked for up to 4 years, requiring holders to lock up Magic Eden tokens for a set time frame. Magic Eden holders can perform quests to earn more rewards, a unique feature that should send Magic Eden into the top 100 next year. Rollblock Ready To Rock The Gaming World This Year While Pudgy Penguins and Magic Eden have yet to gain real momentum, Rollblock ($RBLK) remains the best bet for many investors to scale in early to one of the most promising projects in all of crypto gaming. Stage 9 tokens are selling out rapidly, and the price looks set for a further hike to $0.052 as it progresses to the next stage in the coming days.

37907776,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395825,1734753091,SEC Accuses Tai Mo Shan of Misleading Terra Investors,"The post SEC Accuses Tai Mo Shan of Misleading Terra Investors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cryptocurrency can be a road for financial freedom for some however for others crypto scandals can be disruptive. The SEC has charged Tai Mo Shan Limited, a subsidiary of Jump Crypto Holdings LLC for misleading investors about Terra USD stability and selling unregistered securities. The story doesn’t just expose a company but raises questions about the broader crypto ecosystem. How did things go so wrong? Let’s dig in. The Truth Behind Terra Terra USD was supposed to be a stablecoin. As the name suggests, such a token should remain stable as it should be pegged to $1. Tai Mo Shan played a role in assuring investors it was safe, claiming Terraform Labs’ algorithm kept everything in check. But things weren’t as solid as they seemed. When UST lost its $1 peg in May 2021, Tai Mo Shan stepped in. They made $20 million worth of trades to stabilize the price, temporarily. Could they save it? No. Behind the scenes, the company had an agreement with Terraform Labs. They’d stabilize UST in exchange for discounted LUNA tokens. Investors weren’t told the truth. The peg wasn’t held by some magical algorithm but by external interventions. The SEC calls this misleading. Hard to argue with that. SEC Labels LUNA Sales as Securities Here’s where it gets messier. From January 2021 to May 2022, Tai Mo Shan acquired LUNA tokens from Terraform Labs. Then they resold them on U.S. based exchanges. The SEC sees LUNA and most of the crypto tokens as a security, as we all know. So, by acting as a statutory underwriter and failing to register these offerings, the company broke securities laws. Tai Mo Shan agreed to pay over $123 million in fines , prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. They’re also under a cease and desist order now. But an important thing to note here is that they didn’t admit to the charges. They’re not exactly waving a white flag, just agreeing to move on. What to Expect For the crypto world, Terra collapse was a wake up call. And the SEC is tightening the reins on crypto. Gary Gensler, who is stepping down in January as the SEC chair, shared that protecting investors from fraud is a top priority. This case shows how fragile the systems can be and how much investors rely on trust. Though the new administration is focusing on creating a nurturing environment for the digital space, cases like this highlights the need for strict regulations.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/sec-accuses-tai-mo-shan-of-misleading-terra-investors/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-before-first-exchange-listing-as-pepe-and-wif-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Here’s the Significance,"Recent data from IntoTheBlock highlights notable trends in Litecoin (LTC) holder behavior, offering insights into market dynamics and investor sentiment. According to the analysis shared on X, 78% of Litecoin addresses have held their LTC for over a year, demonstrating an accumulation pattern during bear markets and distribution near peak price levels. This provides valuable context for assessing market sentiment and potential future price movements. 78% of Litecoin addresses have held their $LTC for over a year, typically accumulating during bear markets and selling near peak prices. In this cycle, the slight decrease in long-term holdings is less marked than in past cycles, indicating that many holders are expecting… pic.twitter.com/nB7YuoYEKv — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 19, 2024 Litecoin (LTC) Accumulation in 2024 The data illustrates the consistent role of long-term holders in Litecoin’s market. Historically, these holders have exhibited patience, building positions during periods of low market activity. The accumulation during bearish phases aligns with strategic investment approaches, often reflecting confidence in Litecoin’s long-term value. Conversely, as market cycles progress toward price peaks, these same holders have tended to realize gains, contributing to short-term volatility. An intriguing aspect of the current market cycle is the relatively small decline in long-term holdings compared to previous cycles. This suggests a shift in market sentiment, with many long-term investors maintaining their positions despite price fluctuations. IntoTheBlock notes that this trend may indicate “expectations of further price growth,” signaling optimism regarding Litecoin’s future performance. Litecoin (LTC) Holders Beginning to Sell Although the hodlers have risen in 2024, the chart shows sell-offs during notable rallies. LTC experienced this in 2018 and 2021 when it reached new all-time highs. There was also a slight dip in early 2024 when Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high above $67,000, and Litecoin crossed $100 for the first time in almost a year. The end of the chart also shows this intriguing pattern, as the hodlers are beginning to drop. Litecoin recently experienced a massive resurgence, surpassing $120 for the first time since 2022, and it seems some investors are taking profits. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Is Litecoin About to Climb? Despite this dip, LTC hodlers are still the highest in the asset’s history. This fact, combined with the long period they have held the tokens, reinforces the point made by IntoTheBlock that these token holders are anticipating a bigger price surge. The incoming Donald Trump administration is bringing a crypto-friendly SEC Chair and pro-crypto policies and regulations that could help the market climb further. Litecoin has maintained a loyal base of long-term investors. This base has likely contributed to price stability, even during periods of heightened volatility across the broader cryptocurrency market, and it seems they might reap rewards for their loyalty.

A crypto analyst has warned of an impending XRP price crash, urging investors not to get distracted as the RSI is still significantly above 50%. Discussing his predictions through short and long-term XRP price charts, the analyst shows that the cryptocurrency is firmly positioned in a bullish trend despite impending corrections. XRP Price RSI Hints At Potential Crash On the 4-hour XRP chart, a double tap structure is highlighted in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a technical indicator used to measure the momentum of a cryptocurrency. This double tap pattern typically signals further downward movement before a price stabilization. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash 2 Days Ago, Full Prediction Shows A Further 30% Decline According to Dark Defender, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), the RSI’s recurrent dips into oversold territory indicate that XRP could experience a price crash to new lows. The analyst disclosed that the XRP price had previously found strong support at $2.17; however, the cryptocurrency experienced a bounce to the upside. After hitting this support level, the XRP price is now consolidating, a pattern often associated with a potential uptrend after a correction. Despite the slight market recovery, the analyst has warned of another impending price crash in this same support zone as the RSI approaches oversold levels once more. Earlier in December, the RSI had hit oversold territories after dipping below 30%. Now XRP’s RSI is above 50% and signaling a potential to experience a price correction between the support levels at $2.17 and $2.18. Dark Defender has revealed that this price crash could occur soon as XRP is expected to enter oversold territory within a day. Despite this potential price correction, the analyst has acknowledged that the XRP’s broader outlook still looks bullish, with an uptrend continuation expected once the market consolidates following its projected price dip to new lows. Dark Defender has also predicted that XRP’s next price target after this projected correction is likely above $3, marking an almost 40% increase from the $2.17 support area. XRP 3-Month Chart Signals Strong Bullish Set Up Following his predictions that the XRP price could crash as it enters oversold conditions, Dark Defender also shared a 3-month chart analysis, painting a brighter outlook for the cryptocurrency. The chart shows that XRP has recently broken through a multi-year resistance level for the first time in over five years, signaling a strong bullish shift. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Not The End As Analyst Predicts Another 52% Jump The three-month green candle structure between October and December confirms strong buying pressure, setting the stage for a potentially bullish Q1 2025 from January to March. A rounded bottom pattern can also be seen on the XRP 3-month chart. This pattern is a classic bullish reversal structure that indicates a gradual move from a downtrend to an uptrend. Dark Defender has marked several Fibonacci levels as potential price targets for XRP. According to the analyst, XRP could see a 261.80% rise to the 5.8563 Fibonacci level between $5 to $9. After which, the analyst expects a 361.80% surge to the 18.2275 Fibonacci between $16 to $28. Support levels at the 0.6649 Fibonacci at $0.9 have also been highlighted, acting as a safety net for XRP during price corrections.

37906848,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630081,1734750908,Japan’s controversial crypto tax system set for review in 2025,"Japan’s hotly debated crypto tax system may be getting an overhaul in 2025, thanks to the official inclusion of virtual currencies in the government’s recently finalized 2025 tax reform outline. For the Japanese, anything would beat being taxed at 55%, or in the case of inheritance tax, sometimes 110% on crypto gains, and being unable to offset losses. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Japan has finalized an outline for tax reform plans in 2025, in a meeting held on December 20. In a post to X , house member Junichi Kanda summarized the annual meeting of the nation’s tax commission, noting: “The LDP Tax Commission and Tax System Research Council general meeting finalized the outline of tax reform for fiscal year 2025. The report also included future considerations regarding the tax system for crypto assets.” The news is bullish for mainstream crypto investors, who have been suffering under tax rates as high as 55% on gains in the country, or even — in some cases — mind-blowing gouges to the tune of 110% (more than the value of the actual asset) where inheritance tax on crypto comes into play. House of Representatives member Junichi Kanda posted Friday about the development on social media platform X. Industry players and crypto holders alike have been urging politicians, such as Democratic Party for the People (DPP) leader Yuichiro Tamaki , to revamp the prohibitive system. But recently elected prime minister Shigeru Ishiba has been publicly doubtful of the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, ostensibly standing against such reform. Bitcoiners and crypto-heads in Japan are pushing for a separate 20% rate for crypto gains, which will include the ability to offset losses via a carryover system. According to local media , former minister for digital transformation (DX) and house member Takuya Hirai also submitted a proposal via the FSA (Financial Services Agency) to the minister of finance, to “make crypto assets an asset that contributes to the national economy.” The proposal, which included a separate tax scheme for crypto — instead of considering gains “miscellaneous income” as is currently the case — was reportedly well-received by Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato. Concrete movements toward reform are now expected, but as it stands for 2024, the tax law in the nation remains as convoluted as the Tokyo Metro subway, minus the efficiency and usefulness.

37907348,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52774,1734750419,Cardano Creator Dispels Rumors of XRP and HBAR in Trump Crypto Reserve Plan,"Speculation regarding the inclusion of XRP and Hedera (HBAR) in a potential national cryptocurrency reserve under Donald Trump’s incoming administration has been dispelled by Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson. The controversy emerged following unsubstantiated claims by a Hedera community member that sparked intense discussion across digital asset markets. The initial assertions came from Shawn (@oroogle) on X. According to his statements , the president-elect’s team had developed plans to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve incorporating not only Bitcoin but also XRP and Hedera’s HBAR token. These digital assets were supposedly classified as “American Commodities” in a broader strategy to position the United States as a global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. The claims extended beyond reserve status, suggesting comprehensive integration of both Hedera and Ripple technologies into American electoral and financial infrastructure. Perhaps most notably, these statements included an alleged quote from Eric Trump suggesting his father’s intention to implement tax exemptions for domestically developed cryptocurrencies to reinforce American dominance in the digital asset sector. Will HBAR and XRP Join the Strategic Reserve? Donald Trump has shown notable support for cryptocurrencies, recently nominating a pro-crypto successor to Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and well-known anti-crypto figure. However, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson intervened to address what he characterized as misinformation circulating within the cryptocurrency community. According to Hoskinson, any consideration for a strategic reserve would be limited exclusively to Bitcoin, with no plans to include alternative cryptocurrencies. This isn't accurate. The reserve is only for Bitcoin — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 18, 2024 The cryptocurrency community’s response has been notably divided, as some participants commending Hoskinson’s effort to maintain factual accuracy in industry discourse. Others, however, questioned his motivations, suggesting potential bias due to Cardano’s absence from the purported reserve plans. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further skepticism regarding the feasibility of any cryptocurrency reserve has emerged from prominent industry figures. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has published a detailed analysis arguing against the likelihood of such an initiative. Hayes emphasized that existing governmental priorities, particularly those related to social program funding, would likely preclude the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. Hayes’ analysis also addressed potential market implications, warning of increased volatility in cryptocurrency markets. He specifically highlighted concerns about market instability around the anticipated presidential inauguration in January 2025, suggesting that the president-elect’s perceived cryptocurrency-friendly stance might overly influence current market optimism. However, with rumors that Trump wants to eliminate capital gains taxes on U.S.-based cryptocurrencies, the market could end up in a better place even if the Bitcoin reserve is not established as many expect.

37910971,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631315,1734750000,Crypto Traders Move to Lightchain AI as Ripple (XRP) and Toncoin (TON) Fall Behind,"As the crypto market buzzes with speculation, seasoned traders are turning their attention to Lightchain AI (LCAI)—a token priced at just $0.003 in its presale phase . While Ripple (XRP) grapples with regulatory challenges and Toncoin (TON) struggles to find its identity in a saturated market, Lightchain AI is emerging as a powerful contender with its unique approach to AI-powered blockchain technology. Let’s unpack why this token is causing such a stir in the crypto community. Where Ripple and Toncoin Fall Short Even with their set places, both Ripple and Toncoin are up against troubles that make them not so nice to smart investors. Ripple’s XRP stays favored, but its worth is greatly swayed by ongoing law fights with the SEC creating doubt about its long-term chance. On the other side, Toncoin, even with its link to Telegram, has a hard time finding who it is. Aside from its aim on growth, TON misses a clear story which makes it hard to get a loyal g͏roup of builders or gain wide use. On the other hand Lightchain AI shines as a forward-looking plan with its special focus on smart solutions and an open, good roadmap. A Deeper Look Into Lightchain AI’s Vision Lightchain AI is setting itself apart from other blockchain projects by focusing on the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), rather than simply addressing scalability or payment solutions. Its mission is to go beyond decentralization and create an ecosystem where blockchain technology fuels advanced AI capabilities for real-world applications. At its core is the Adaptive AI Framework, powered by the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), which evolves with community input to stay on the cutting edge of AI innovation. Ethical AI development is another cornerstone of Lightchain AI’s vision. By leveraging Proof of Intelligence (PoI), the platform ensures energy-efficient and purposeful computations, addressing pressing concerns around AI ethics and sustainability. Additionally, Lightchain AI has already begun establishing partnerships in industries such as healthcare and finance, ensuring its technology is applied to practical, impactful use cases. Features Driving Lightchain AI’s Popularity Several key features make Lightchain AI a standout project. Its Dynamic AI Ecosystem Expansion emphasizes the creation of an open-source innovation hub, allowing developers from various industries to collaborate on groundbreaking projects. This dynamic approach contrasts with the static nature of other platforms. Data privacy is also a central focus of Lightchain AI. By using privacy-preserving technologies like homomorphic encryption, the platform ensures the security of sensitive AI data computations, which is particularly critical for industries like healthcare and finance. Furthermore, Lightchain AI is building strong global cross-industry partnerships. The platform is actively engaging with enterprises to implement its technology in areas such as logistics optimization, predictive analytics, and climate modeling—markets that remain unexplored by many other projects in the blockchain space. Why Smart Money Is Betting on Lightchain AI Institutional investors and crypto whales have started accumulating LCAI tokens, and for good reason. Lightchain AI addresses inefficiencies in traditional AI models while offering blockchain-backed decentralization. One area of focus is AI-driven decentralized finance (DeFi), where Lightchain AI enhances platforms with predictive models to enable smarter lending and borrowing mechanisms. The platform also provides advanced developer tools, such as APIs and SDKs, to streamline the development of AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps), which in turn attracts top-tier talent to the ecosystem. Sustainability is another major draw for investors, as Proof of Intelligence significantly reduces the platform’s carbon footprint, appealing to those who prioritize environmentally conscious investments. With its innovative approach and real-world applications, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to lead the way in the integration of blockchain and AI. Rare Opportunity for Exponential Growth While Ripple and Toncoin navigate their respective challenges, Lightchain AI is blazing a trail with its innovative blend of AI integration, real-world applications, and deflationary tokenomics. With its low entry price and high growth potential, LCAI offers a chance for investors to participate in the next major shift in the crypto landscape. Smart investors understand the importance of timing. Don’t wait to join the Lightchain AI presale—secure your stake now and prepare for a potential breakout that could redefine the industry.

The timing for the purchase couldn’t be less perfect, as the crypto market plunged after a hawkish Fed meeting on Wednesday where officials voted for the third and final interest rate cut of 2024 by 25 basis points. During the press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also addressed the prospect of the central bank building a strategic reserve of Bitcoin, one of Trump’s boldest campaign promises to the crypto industry. The official said that the central bank is legally not allowed to hold Bitcoin and is not looking for a law change. For context, in July 2024, Republican Senator Cyntia Lummis introduced a Bitcoin Act to create such a reserve, proposing to acquire 5 percent of the BTC supply funded by Fed bank deposits and gold holdings. Powell’s comments poured cold water on expectations that Bitcoin’s price will continue its upward trend fueled by optimism over Trump’s embrace of the crypto industry. Following the Fed meeting, Bitcoin saw a sharp decline, falling by 6% within hours to $98,900 after trading above $100,000 for the past week, during which it reached a new ATH of $108,135. Ethereum and other major altcoins mirrored the downturn, with ETH losing 11% since Wednesday and currently trading at $3,400. Despite backing from the president-elect, World Liberty Financial got off to a rocky start. The October public sale of WLFI tokens only managed to sell a little more than 4% of the coins. Because of lukewarm demand, the project had to slash its presale goal from $300 million to just $30 million. Besides stagnating sales, WLFI faces other behind-the-scenes issues, such as a lack of a well-defined roadmap, barriers to entry antithetical to the tenets of DeFi, and possible conflict of interest. The project, which was launched with the commitment to democratize and depoliticize finance through decentralized lending, directs the sale of WLFI tokens only to accredited investors who meet a certain wealth threshold, a criterion that excludes a broader audience from participating. WLFI scoops up alts and lends a helping hand to Justin Sun Besides Ethereum, World Liberty Financial has been actively shopping for other altcoins, including ETH, WBTC, AAVE, LINK, ENA, and ONDO. Meanwhile, the native token of CoW Protocol (COW) used by WLFI jumped nearly 35% over the last 24 hours due to investors’ speculative interest in the platform. On Thursday, World Liberty Financial swapped $10.4 million of cbBTC for wBTC, taking the side of a controversial crypto mogul Justin Sun in his brawl with Coinbase over wBTC delisting. The popular Bitcoin wrapper issued by BiT Global was delisted by Coinbase without much elaboration except its alleged incompatibility with the exchange’s listing standards. In response, BiT Global filed a lawsuit, claiming that the move was meant to give Coinbase’s own wrapper, cbBTC, an unfair advantage. Coinbase countered with the claim that Justin Sun’s control over BiT Global presented unacceptable risks for customers. While Justin Sun’s connection to BitGo may be less clear, his ties to World Liberty Financial are much more obvious. The $30 million investment in WLFI announced by Sun in November made him at the time the project’s largest investor. The following day, Sun was invited to join the advisory board, cementing the Sun-Trump alliance. Ethereum ETFs with record inflows in December Despite the market’s neurotic reaction to the Fed’s recent rate cut, Ethereum ETFs performed exceptionally well in December, The Block’s data suggests. This month has brought $1.66 billion in new investments to such products, which is 74% of the $2.24 billion total inflows since inception. The market structure of Ethereum ETFs remains highly concentrated, with BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) staying ahead of the competition by a wide margin. On December 5, ETHA recorded a single-day high of $292 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity's FETH as the second most popular choice. Other Ethereum ETF providers have garnered only modest investor interest compared to the broader distribution seen in Bitcoin ETFs.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6672/trump-s-crypto-project-buys-eth-dip-amid-market-downturn,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37905682,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52704,1734747334,$TICS at $0.034: The Best Crypto to Join in December 2024 with Unlimited Potential Amid Render’s Growth and Toncoin’s Whale Surge,"Which digital assets could redefine financial landscapes this December? As we edge closer to 2025, cryptocurrency markets are buzzing with activity, with investors closely monitoring the best cryptos to join in December 2024. From strategic acquisitions by whale investors to groundbreaking blockchain innovations, the latest developments have set the stage for an exhilarating year-end. Toncoin has captured headlines with its surging whale activity, while Render continues to intrigue analysts with its price forecasts for 2025 and beyond. However, the spotlight undoubtedly shines on Qubetics ($TICS), a project revolutionising blockchain technology with its unique presale structure and unmatched use cases. This article delves into the latest updates and opportunities surrounding these three cryptos: Qubetics, Toncoin, and Render. Let’s explore why Qubetics is leading the pack among the best cryptos to join in December 2024. Qubetics: Redefining Cross-Border Payments How do banks and financial institutions stay competitive in an increasingly interconnected world? Qubetics ($TICS) offers a revolutionary solution tailored to modern financial needs. Its cutting-edge blockchain network empowers institutions to perform near-instant cross-border payments and settlements, eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional systems. By forging strategic partnerships with the Qubetics Network, banks can achieve faster, more cost-effective, and transparent transactions. This advancement benefits businesses reliant on swift settlements to maintain operational efficiency and individuals seeking faster international remittances. Could this be the breakthrough that reshapes global finance?\ Adding to its momentum, Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session , engaging its vibrant community with insights and updates about the network’s vision and utility. With these developments, it’s no surprise that Qubetics is emerging as one of the best cryptos to join in December 2024. Toncoin: Whale Investors Fuel a 27% Surge Toncoin (TON), the cryptocurrency of The Open Network, has experienced a dramatic price surge, thanks to the involvement of major investors. By the end of November 2024, whales accumulated nearly $30 million worth of TON in just four days, driving a 27% price increase and pushing the token above $6.20. This bullish activity highlights growing confidence in Toncoin’s potential, amplified by recent regulatory changes such as the resignation of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Its integration with Telegram’s 800-million-strong user base positions Toncoin as a frontrunner for mainstream adoption. With a market capitalisation of $13.96 billion, Toncoin is proving its relevance as a strategic asset in the evolving crypto market. Render: A Rollercoaster Year with Optimistic Projections The price of Render ($RENDER) currently sits at $7.71, reflecting a -3.14% decline this month. Despite this dip, long-term forecasts remain optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential high of $13.20 by the end of 2025 and a staggering $96.94 by 2030. Render has seen significant developments this year, with a 60.28% increase in GPU computing power usage during Q1 2024, leading to a strong rally in March. While its price has cooled since reaching a record high above $13.00, Render’s growing market cap of $3.02 billion underscores its resilience and potential for recovery. A Thrilling Opportunity: The Qubetics Presale What makes the Qubetics presale so compelling? In Phase 13, the presale boasts weekly phases with a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. At just $0.034 per $TICS token, Qubetics has already raised over $7.3 million, attracted 10,900+ holders, and sold an impressive 363 million tokens. This unique structure rewards early participants and fuels anticipation with every phase. For investors seeking the best cryptos to join in December 2024 , Qubetics presents an unmatched opportunity. With its robust community backing and innovative approach, $TICS tokens are more than an investment—they’re a statement of trust in the future of blockchain. Conclusion: Why Qubetics ($TICS) Stands Out As December unfolds, Qubetics ($TICS), Toncoin, and Render each present unique opportunities for investors. While Toncoin benefits from whale activity and Render boasts strong long-term potential, Qubetics is redefining the crypto landscape with its revolutionary technology and presale strategy. For those seeking the best cryptos to join in December 2024, Qubetics offers an exciting chance to be part of a groundbreaking project at an early stage. With its momentum building and presale nearing completion, now is the time to secure your stake in $TICS tokens and position yourself at the forefront of blockchain innovation.

Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE Revolutionizes Blockchain Development,"As December 2024 unfolds, the crypto market is buzzing with activity. Recent reports highlight a significant influx of capital, with Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana collectively attracting $130 billion, signaling renewed investor confidence. Amidst this financial whirlwind, Qubetics ($TICS) is making waves by addressing real-world challenges that have hindered blockchain adoption. Its innovative QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is set to simplify blockchain development, making it more accessible to developers of all skill levels. Qubetics ($TICS): Simplifying Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is currently in its 13th presale stage, offering $TICS tokens at $0.0342. The project has already raised over $7 million, attracting more than 10,600 holders and selling over 355 million tokens. The QubeQode IDE is a game-changer in the blockchain space. It provides a user-friendly platform with drag-and-drop components and a code snippet library, simplifying the development of blockchain applications. This approach not only accelerates development but also lowers the entry threshold for new developers, fostering a more inclusive blockchain ecosystem. By addressing real-world challenges such as complex user interfaces and limited transaction scalability, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the blockchain space. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, representing a significant return on investment. To learn more about Qubetics, you can check this out: Watch the Video . Solana (SOL): Riding the Wave of Market Momentum Solana has been making headlines with its rapid growth and increasing market momentum. Recent reports indicate that traders are betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut, leading to a surge in investments in cryptocurrencies like Solana. This influx of capital has contributed to Solana’s rising prominence in the crypto market. Investing in Solana offers exposure to a high-performance blockchain known for its fast transaction speeds and low fees. However, potential investors should be aware of the volatility associated with the crypto market and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Cardano (ADA): Steady Growth Amid Market Fluctuations Cardano continues to demonstrate steady growth, even amid market fluctuations. While Bitcoin recently dipped below $98,000, affecting the broader crypto market, Cardano has maintained its position, reflecting its resilience and the confidence of its community. Cardano’s focus on scalability, security, and sustainability makes it a compelling option for investors seeking long-term growth in the crypto space. Its commitment to peer-reviewed research and a robust development roadmap further solidify its standing as a reliable blockchain platform. Conclusion: Qubetics Leading the Charge In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, Qubetics stands out with its innovative approach to simplifying blockchain development through the QubeQode IDE . By addressing real-world challenges and making blockchain technology more accessible, Qubetics is poised to make a significant impact in the crypto space. With its presale in the 13th stage and tokens priced at $0.0342, now is an opportune time to consider investing in Qubetics. Analysts predict substantial growth, with potential returns that could make a meaningful difference for early investors.

After retesting levels below $2, the price is now maintaining bullish momentum. Bitcoin and other coins are also down right now, and some traders are taking advantage of the dip by buying more. The price of XRP has been consolidating around the $2 range, and this is where it could stay for a while, which is a good sign for holders. Overall, the market is seeing a lot of liquidations, with $680 million wiped out in the last 12 hours alone. Short-Term Price Range and Potential Movements Currently, XRP is trading between $1.96 and its all-time high of $3.30. The price remains squeezed within this range, and a potential upside movement could still emerge. A short-term bullish scenario could see one or two additional highs as part of a larger wave structure, similar to what is expected in other major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SEC Accuses Tai Mo Shan of Misleading Terra Investors , Possible Elliott Wave Count and Structure There are two possible Elliott Wave counts on the XRP chart. The first suggests the top may already be in place, with the current price action forming a fourth wave triangle. If this count plays out, a final fifth wave could complete the current bullish cycle. The second wave count proposes that an additional 4-5% upside movement may occur before the cycle concludes. The focus remains on the current structure and its potential implications. XRP’s price is on a rollercoaster ride curious about where it’s headed? Read our long-term XRP price prediction for the full outlook! Validation and Invalidations: Key Price Levels To keep the triangle scenario alive, XRP must stay above $1.90. If the price breaks below this level, it would invalidate the triangle count, suggesting a more direct ABC correction. This scenario would likely see XRP move lower before any potential recovery. For now, it’s important to remain flexible regarding the exact microstructure of the market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37905636,https://nulltx.com/?p=136071,1734746457,Miami Student Gains $1M with LTC; Is BlockDAG Next?,"How a Student Turned $5,600 into $1M with Litecoin—BlockDAG Prepares for Even Greater Returns in Presale! Success often finds those who recognize potential early. Consider the remarkable journey of a Miami college student who, in 2013, used $5,600 to buy Litecoin (LTC) at $2 per coin. By 2017, Litecoin’s rise to $360 per coin transformed his initial stake into an astonishing $1 million, illustrating the impact of strategic early moves in the crypto world. Now, BlockDAG (BDAG) presents a similar prospect, poised to match or even surpass Litecoin’s success. How a Miami Student’s $5,600 Bet on Litecoin Became $1M Back in 2013, the crypto market was still emerging, but Bitcoin’s dramatic rise caught many eyes. A Miami student saw the potential in this space and, with a bold step and $5,600 in hand, he invested in Litecoin (LTC) at $2 per coin. Over four years, as Litecoin’s value increased, his patience and strategic thinking were rewarded. By 2017, his investment soared to $1 million as Litecoin reached $360 per coin. This story highlights how early, well-thought-out risks can lead to substantial rewards. For those who missed Litecoin’s impressive climb, BlockDAG, a pioneering layer-1 blockchain, offers a new opportunity for significant returns. BlockDAG: The DAG Pioneer with Unprecedented Growth Potential BlockDAG merges the robust security of blockchain with the flexibility of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, effectively addressing scalability, security, and decentralization issues faced by traditional blockchains. Its dual Blockchain + DAG architecture enhances transaction speeds, scalability, and reliability, establishing it as a leading Layer 1 project. BlockDAG’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model upholds network integrity while promoting decentralized management, making it an appealing choice for those seeking long-term growth. The platform’s technological strength has attracted significant market interest, accumulating over $170 million through 26 presale rounds. Prices have escalated from $0.001 in the initial batch to $0.0234 in the latest, marking a substantial 2,240% increase. Experts now anticipate a potential 30,000x ROI for early participants. The continued momentum of BlockDAG’s presale indicates it is on course to reach its $600 million goal, reinforcing its status as a premier crypto acquisition. How BlockDAG May Surpass Litecoin in Future Gains While Litecoin has shown the benefits of early adoption, BlockDAG presents an even more promising opportunity. Its sophisticated technology offers unmatched scalability and security, essential for future blockchain demands. With a 2,240% increase in its value already, projections suggest a potential rise to $30 per coin by 2030. At the current presale price of $0.0234, these forecasts suggest growth that could far surpass that of Litecoin. BlockDAG is also tailored to modern needs with its low-code/no-code smart contract functionality, allowing users to develop and implement smart contracts with minimal technical expertise. This simplifies the application of blockchain technology for businesses, developers, and non-technical users, fostering wider adoption and enhancing the value of BDAG coins. The Next Wave of Millionaires Crypto success often arises from seizing opportunities before they become mainstream. While Litecoin has previously minted millionaires, BlockDAG stands as the top crypto presale with its state-of-the-art Layer 1 technology and potential for massive financial returns. For those considering this emerging leader, now is an ideal time to engage. BDAG coins are currently priced at just $0.0234, but as the sale of batch 26 nears completion, the shift to batch 27 could mean significant price increases. Immediate action is crucial to avoid missing out on what could be a transformative wealth-building opportunity.

This AI altcoin has the potential to grow 70x in the first quarter of 2025. Investors are putting funds into WallitIQ (WLTQ) in whale-like motion, confident in its ability to deliver solid exponential returns. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin and XRP prices have recently shown signs of nearing the $5 mark. Despite this, many prominent investors are more interested in WallitIQ (WLTQ) as it is currently priced at an affordable $0.0243 in its ongoing presale. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Returns Dwarfs Potential Gains From Dogecoin And XRP Prices Hitting $5 Following a significant yearly peak of $0.47 last month, many analysts predict that Dogecoin, currently trading at $0.4063 , might hit the $5 mark soon as analysts are on the lookout for this increase in 2025. On Monday, the XRP price rallied further to test the resistance level at $2.58 after bouncing off the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. The maximum profit target from the pole’s length indicates that the XRP price could hit a new all-time high of $5. A high-volume move above the resistance levels at $2.58 and $2.92 could accelerate the rally to $5. With the XRP price currently at $2.69 , hitting $5 seems more plausible for Ripple (XRP) than ever. Yet, even if Dogecoin and XRP prices reach the $5 milestone, the returns are still very modest compared to what the new AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), offers. Currently priced at just $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides an opportunity for investors seeking exponential growth. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 70x potential dwarfs the gains from Dogecoin and Ripple (XRP). Unlike Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin, which are already mature assets with slower growth rates, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a new project, and its ability to grow from its current presale price of $0.0243 by 70x in 2025 gives it an edge over Dogecoin and the XRP price. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Smart Choice for Forward-Thinking Investors Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin offer significant returns. However, AI altcoin WallitIQ (WLTQ) could soon outshine Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin. The project’s appealing features are driving fast adoption. WallitIQ (WLTQ) prioritizes security and user experience. It uses AI-powered anomaly detection to monitor transactions, offering enhanced protection by detecting potential threats in real-time. A thorough audit conducted by SolidProof verifies the reliability of its smart contract. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI altcoin provides significant benefits to its users, including staking rewards of up to 180% APY, premium features, unlimited referral bonuses, and transaction fee coverage within its ecosystem. Priced at an accessible $0.0243 during its presale, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents an attractive investment opportunity with the potential to deliver returns that rival or surpass those of Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making a name in the AI market, valued at over $136 billion in 2023. Its integration of AI and blockchain ensures relevance in two of the fastest-growing industries, driving more rapid adoption. Its ongoing presale is drawing significant attention from retail and institutional investors, thanks to its low entry price of $0.0243 and sky-high upside potential. Dogecoin and Ripple (XRP) offer mere peanuts compared to this AI altcoin. Act Now or Regret Later While Dogecoin and XRP prices continue their journey toward the $5 milestone, their potential returns are limited compared to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 70x promise. The opportunity will not remain open forever. The AI altcoin is currently in its second presale stage, meaning the window for maximizing returns is rapidly closing. Early investors in projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum reaped life-changing rewards not because of luck, but because they acted decisively when the prices were low. Imagine seeing headlines about WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) price increase months from now, knowing you had the chance to buy in early but hesitated. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Buy the WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI altcoin at its presale price of $0.0243 and set yourself up for exponential profits soon.

37906711,https://nulltx.com/?p=136085,1734746413,"Web3Bay, Solana & Tron: Are These Utility Coins Leading the Crypto Revolution?","Looking Past Bitcoin: Strategic Crypto Investments in Web3Bay, Solana, & Tron for the Next 5 Years Cryptocurrencies and Web3 technologies have transformed from industry jargon into critical components shaping the future of finance, privacy, and digital interactions. The surge in global cryptocurrency adoption is fueled significantly by heavyweight investors like Fidelity and BlackRock, who are actively enhancing the sector’s credibility. Remarkably, about 6.8% of the global population, over 560 million people, now engage with cryptocurrency. Amidst this explosive growth, utility coins like Solana and Tron are gaining traction, but the real game-changer could be Web3Bay, poised to command a larger ecosystem. Don’t Miss Out on Web3Bay’s Rise in Crypto E-Commerce As the pace of cryptocurrency adoption quickens, Web3Bay is rapidly becoming a dominant force in the e-commerce landscape, moving from theoretical utility to tangible, real-world impact. Supported by giants such as Fidelity and BlackRock, the crypto sphere is gaining unprecedented legitimacy. While platforms like Solana and Tron push the envelope with sophisticated blockchain solutions, Web3Bay distinguishes itself by focusing on decentralizing e-commerce. Operating on a robust Layer-1 blockchain, Web3Bay guarantees the privacy, control, and transparency demanded by today’s crypto users, empowering them to manage their data securely. The 3BAY token, central to Web3Bay’s operations, goes beyond mere transactions by offering governance rights, exclusive rewards, and discounts, thus directly involving users in shaping the platform’s future. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale introduces the 3BAY token at just $0.003, with prices set to climb 15% through 28 stages. By the final stage, the token price is projected to hit $0.1959, translating to a potential ROI of over 6000% for early participants. As cryptocurrencies become integral to finance and digital experiences, Web3Bay is establishing itself as a powerhouse, seamlessly integrating Web2 and Web3 to create a revolutionary decentralized shopping experience. Solana’s Impressive Growth & Future Outlook Recently, Solana has shown remarkable progress, trading around $221 and nearing its all-time high of $263.83 as of December 2024. Known for its ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, Solana stands out in the blockchain community, particularly for decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications due to its high speed and low fees. Market analysts predict that Solana could reach new peaks, potentially climbing to $300 in 2025 and possibly surpassing $900 by 2030. Tron’s Steady Market Performance Tron remains a strong player in a volatile market, with network activity showing that 97% of TRX investors were profitable as of December 2024—an indicator of robust market confidence. In October 2024, Tron’s blockchain processed a record-breaking 10 million transactions in a single day, with a user base that now exceeds 296 million accounts, indicating strong ongoing demand. Time to Invest in These Utility Altcoins While Solana and Tron continue to impress with their advanced transaction capabilities and active networks, Web3Bay is carving out a niche with its innovative approach to decentralized e-commerce. With a presale designed to generously reward early backers and a commitment to bridging conventional and crypto payments, Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping. As the need for more privacy, greater control, and enhanced utility in cryptocurrencies grows, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leader, ready to define the future of Web3-driven commerce.

37904745,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665722,1734746405,Bitcoin Realized Losses Spike 3 Times The Weekly Average – Healthy Correction Or Downturn?,"Bitcoin has faced its first major correction since early November, dropping 13% from its all-time high of $108,364. This sudden pullback has sent shockwaves across the crypto market, shifting sentiment from extreme bullishness to uncertainty and even fear. The sell-off has been particularly brutal for altcoins, many of which are bleeding hard as Bitcoin struggles to regain momentum. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Cardano Whales Are ‘Buying The Dip’ – Details Key metrics from CryptoQuant highlight the gravity of the situation, with realized losses totaling $28.9 million—an alarming 3.2 times higher than the weekly average. This spike in realized losses suggests that some investors exit positions as the market recalibrates after weeks of aggressive upward movement. The big question now is whether this is simply a healthy correction in an otherwise bullish trend or the start of a larger downtrend. Traders are closely watching Bitcoin’s ability to hold critical support levels and the behavior of altcoins, which often amplify Bitcoin’s price movements. For now, the market remains at a crossroads, with the coming days likely to reveal whether Bitcoin can recover and resume its uptrend—or if this correction signals a more prolonged period of weakness. Bitcoin Facing Selling Pressure Bitcoin is under significant selling pressure after two days of aggressive bearish activity, marking a pivotal moment for the market. The sudden sentiment shift has caused many analysts and investors to turn cautious, with some flipping bearish as Bitcoin’s recent trend begins to lose momentum. This correction has left the market questioning whether the current price movement is a natural pause or a precursor to deeper losses. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insights on X, supported by compelling on-chain data, highlighting that realized losses have surged to $28.9 million. This figure is 3.2 times higher than the weekly average, indicating heightened selling activity. Adler’s analysis underscores that while the sell-off might seem alarming, it’s consistent with a healthy market correction, especially following Bitcoin’s remarkable rally to $108,300. Adler notes that the current dip should not trigger panic but instead serve as a moment of patience for long-term holders. He emphasized that now is a time to HODL unless additional bearish signals emerge to suggest a more prolonged downtrend. Corrections like this often provide the market with the necessary fuel for the next leg up, as weaker hands exit and strong hands position themselves strategically. Related Reading: Solana Holds Monthly Support As Network Activity Grows – Time For A Breakout? Price action remains critical, with investors watching closely to determine whether this correction solidifies a strong foundation for future growth or signals further downside. BTC Holding Bullish Structure (For Now) Bitcoin is trading at $94,400 following three consecutive days of aggressive selling pressure. Despite the apparent bearish sentiment gripping the market, BTC has managed to maintain its footing above the key support level of $92,000. This support is crucial as it clearly defines the ongoing uptrend. Holding above this level suggests resilience and sets the stage for a potential strong bounce if buyers regain control in the coming sessions. While the recent price action reflects uncertainty, the decline has not been as severe as the market sentiment indicates. Negative emotions have driven many traders to adopt a cautious stance, but BTC’s ability to stay above $92,000 shows underlying strength in the market structure. Related Reading: ONDO Exchange Inflows Grow – Volatility Ahead? However, sentiment remains a critical market driver. Restoring confidence will be essential for Bitcoin to reclaim higher levels and resume its bullish momentum. If sentiment does not improve and prices continue to drop, the risk of a deeper correction becomes more likely. Losing the $92,000 support could pave the way for a retest of lower levels, potentially causing additional volatility.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

The research firm Cerulli Associates says $105 trillion will be passed on to heirs by 2048, while charities will receive $18 trillion over the same period. Baby Boomers, the Silent Generation and other older generations will be the major benefactors. “Nearly $100 trillion will be transferred from Baby Boomers and older generations, representing 81% of all transfers. More than 50% of the overall total volume of transfers ($62 trillion) is expected to come from those who are currently high-net-worth (HNW) and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW), which together make up only 2% of all households.” Over the short term, generation X will benefit more than Millennials from the Great Wealth Transfer. “Millennials will be inheriting the most of any generation over the course of the next 25 years ($46 trillion). However, Gen X stands to inherit the greatest portion of assets in the next 10 years, totaling $14 trillion to Millennials’ $8 trillion.” Widows in the Baby Boomer and the Silent Generation as well as other older generations are set to receive about 38% of the wealth before it can get to heirs and charities, according to the report. “Projections of horizontal, or intra-generational, transfers show that $54 trillion will be passed on to spouses before eventually transferring intergenerationally to heirs and to charities.

37902993,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631285,1734742598,Israeli National charged by the US DOJ for collaborating with LockBit hackers,"The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has charged a 51-year-old Russian-Israeli dual citizen, Rostislav Panev, over his alleged involvement with LockBit, the notorious ransomware group. The DOJ is currently seeking his extradition from Israel, where he was arrested. Panev was arrested in August following two guilty pleas in July from two Russian members of the group; Ruslan Astamirov and Mikhail Vasiliev. The LockBit gang , according to the US Department of Justice, has hit over 2500 victims in 120 countries around the world. These include small businesses, large multinationals, hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, and government and law enforcement agencies. Notable victims of LockBit include Boeing Co., The Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, and the UK’s Royal Mail. The group has been connected to a string of ransomware attacks, with victims’ data locked up or their systems rendered inoperable until they extort a fee from them. LockBit developer arrested Rostilav Panev worked as a developer and coder for LockBit for approximately five years starting from its inception in 2019 to February 2024. The now-detained developer received approximately $230,000 in cryptocurrency transfers as payment for his work, according to the charges filed by the Department of Justice. LockBit and its affiliates extorted at least $500M in payments from victims and also caused significant losses in revenue. According to Panev’s lawyer, defense attorney Sharon Nahari, he developed tools for the group without any knowledge of the intended use of the software. The superseding complaint received by the DOJ alleges that Panev exchanged direct messages through a cybercriminal forum with LockBit’s primary administrator. His attorney, Sharon Nahari, maintains that Panev corresponded with the group solely through Telegram messages and had no idea about their identity. “The arrest of Mr. Panev reflects the Department’s commitment to using all its tools to combat the ransomware threat,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland also stated that three individuals allegedly responsible for the cyber attacks against thousands of victims are in custody and that the Justice Department will continue to hold all those who enable ransomware attacks accountable. Law enforcement crackdown The LockBit group emerged in 2019. The group was discovered in 2020 when its malicious software was discovered on a Russian cybercrimes forum. In February, law enforcement in the UK and the US seized websites and servers used by LockBit members and associates. The police also obtained victim data and thousands of decryption keys urging victims to reach out to the group for help in recovering their stolen data. LockBit quickly resurfaced after the seizure, stating threateningly, “I cannot be stopped.” Despite their bold stance, the efforts of law enforcement have significantly weakened the group’s ability.

37918577,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321684,1734742313,Christmas Sale or Crypto Crash? XRP Plunges as Market Bleeds Red – Can XRP Fall Below $1?,"Crypto prices are crashing this week following the Federal Reserve’s hawkish comments about its monetary policy actions for 2025 and inflation. XRP has been swept into the whirlwind as is experiencing an 8.4% loss in the past 24 hours. However, the market’s early panic has been tampering as the U.S. session starts and the price XRP has temporarily bounced off an important horizontal support. The performance of this cryptocurrency in 2024 has been remarkable, producing gains of 252.6% since the year started. A positive court ruling in its case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been one of the most relevant tailwinds that has contributed to lifting its price. Moreover, Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election also helped propel the value of Ripple (XRP) to new heights, primarily as the new administration has a supportive view of the blockchain space. Being a U.S.-based blockchain company, Ripple stands to benefit from pro-crypto policies pushed forward not just by Trump but also by a large group of supportive lawmakers. They will soon make their way to Congressional seats and can expedite the approval of a widely awaited legal framework for the sector. This just in…we have final approval from @NYDFS for $RLUSD ! Exchange and partner listings will be live soon – and reminder: when RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from @Ripple first. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 10, 2024 On December 10, the Chief Executive Officer of XRP announced that the company got approval to commercialize its new stablecoin RLUSD by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Once this new asset hits all major exchanges, it could result in a dramatic increase in network activity for Ripple and could mark the beginning of a new era for the blockchain. XRP Recovers From Early Losses During American Session Today’s price action was particularly interesting as the price bottomed at a key area of support at $1.95 per coin and then buyers showed up to scoop up the bargain. As a result, the American session erased all of these early losses and ended up pushing the price above the $2 mark once again. That said, the trend line support has been broken now, which means that the price will likely follow a new path. For now, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has stepped off overbought territory and it is now nearing the 50 area – a middle ground that typically signals the direction of the trend. As long as the oscillator stays above that threshold, momentum is still on the positive side. However, another significant push downwards like the one seen earlier today could result in a break of this key support and would send XRP to the $1.5 zone where the next horizontal support is found. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst XRP whale predicted yesterday on his X account that the price of the asset will hit $3 within the next 72 hours. He attributed his enthusiastic forecast to the approval of RLUSD – which is considered by most XRP maximalists as a major milestone for this blockchain project. $XRP WILL HIT $3 IN THE NEXT 72HRS! #XRP — XRP whale (@realXRPwhale) December 20, 2024 Similar to XRP, other assets have recovered some of the territory they lost during the Asian session. Solana (SOL) is currently exhibiting a mild 1.9% loss after experiencing a sharp 18% decline earlier in the day while Dogecoin (DOGE) is also down just 0.9% just hours after posting a decline of around 20%. This Meme Coin Keeps Raising Millions Despite the Market’s Heightened Volatility Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has attracted over $33 million in capital from investors during its presale despite the latest weakness that tokens in this segment of the crypto market have been experiencing. The success of its predecessor Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) appears to have paved the way for this new Pepe-the-frog-themed asset to attract this much money in addition to the bargain price of $0.0003651 at which the token is being offered. Welcome to the fam. pic.twitter.com/uSoEfKvt7I — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 20, 2024 $WEPE is a parody character of the ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ with a mission to change the status quo in the crypto world by taking power off the hands of deep-pocketed market whales. To achieve this, he is building an army of loyal fans – the WEPE army – who will HODL their tokens as if their lives depend on it. The presale ends in just 17 hours and crypto gurus are sure that the success that this initial offering has already seen will spill over to the next stage of this project – which is its listing on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Early buyers of $PEPU managed to take home triple-digit returns from their presale investment and $WEPE has positioned itself favorably to deliver similar gains. You can buy $WEPE before the presale ends by visiting the official website of Wall Street Pepe . You can either connect your wallet to convert ETH or USDT into $WEPE or use a bank card. In addition, if you don’t have a wallet now, Best Wallet offers the best features to keep track of the hottest offerings in the market right now. The post Christmas Sale or Crypto Crash?

According to some market watchers, the flagship crypto’s recent performance resembles its December 2023 trajectory, suggesting that BTC might see a massive breakout soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Peak Between $160,000 And $290,000 If These Historical Patterns Repeat – Report Bitcoin Price Mirrors December 2023’s Performance On Wednesday, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market saw a massive correction after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced a 25-basis-point rate cut and signaled fewer cuts than expected in 2025. The flagship cryptocurrency dropped 9.2% from its $108,135 all-time high (ATH), briefly falling below the $99,000 on support before recovering. BTC quickly climbed back to $100,000, surging 2% on Thursday morning to the $102,000 resistance. After the dump, crypto trader Follis suggested that this month’s price action mirrored BTC’s 2023 trajectory. The trader stated that Bitcoin was “repeating the December playbook from last year,” forecasting that a pump to a new high is coming soon. Per the chart, BTC moved within the $40,000-$45,000 price range before breaking out in January 2024. The breakout was followed by a significant 20% correction to the previous consolidation zone, briefly dipping below this range. However, Bitcoin reclaimed the breakout levels in the following weeks and surged another 47% to its March ATH of $73,000. If the largest crypto by market cap continues to follow this “playbook,” then its price could see a correction below $88,000 by year-end before resuming its bullish run to new highs. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that BTC’s performance in Q4 resembles its Q4 2023 price action. The analyst stated that Bitcoin will likely continue the “slow hoppy grind up before the actual breakout” happens. He recommended “zooming out” as the short-term chart “doesn’t look pretty” but noted that BTC’s price is still “trending up slowly.” Analyst Warns Of BTC’s Daily Close Other analysts suggested that the coming hours will be decisive for BTC’s short-term performance. Rekt Capital asserted that holding the $100,000 support was crucial, as failing to maintain this level could send Bitcoin below the previous key resistance of $98,000. Moreover, a daily close above the $101,000 mark would be necessary to prevent this range from turning into resistance again. The analyst emphasized that “doing so could kickstart a chain of events where BTC starts to lose support level by level.” Related Reading: Sentiment For Ethereum Hits 1-year Low, Analyst Says A Massive Run Is Coming He added that a close above this level would invalidate the short-term bearish outlook. Previously, the analyst explained that Bitcoin is amid the first “Price Discovery Correction,” which tends to happen between the 6thand 8th week of BTC’s post-halving “Parabolic Upside Phase”: As a result, over the next 3 weeks or so, I am going to be increasingly cautious about retest attempts, and given BTC’s history at this point in the cycle, I wouldn’t be surprised to see key levels get invalidated. However, he emphasized that the “Second Price Discovery Uptrend” will follow the big correction. As of this writing, Bitcoin has dipped below the $100,000 support level, registering a 5.1% 24-hour drop to the $98,900 mark.

Crypto All-Stars is nearing the end of its presale today, having raised an incredible $25M, making it one of the most successful meme coin presales of 2024. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to push boundaries by integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), expanding its tokens to 12 blockchains. But the coin everyone’s talking about is BTFD Coin, a fresh new entrant that’s creating a storm with its $4.2M presale and innovative features like 90% APY staking and a beta play-to-earn (P2E) game. With over 57 billion tokens sold to more than 6,100 holders, BTFD Coin is quickly gaining traction as the meme coin to watch. Let’s dive deeper into why Crypto All-Stars, Shiba Inu, and BTFD Coin are the best meme coins to buy this week and how each is reshaping the crypto landscape. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Are Running Wild First, let’s talk about BTFD Coin , the meme coin that’s quickly becoming the talk of the town. BTFD Coin’s presale, now in its 12th stage, has already raised $4.2M, selling over 57 billion tokens to more than 6,100 investors. With only 16 presale stages in total, time is running out to grab this coin at its current price of $0.00013. But why is everyone so excited about BTFD Coin? For starters, it’s not just a meme coin—it’s a community-powered movement. The coin’s branding, focused on helping investors “own the dip,” has struck a chord with those looking for smart investment opportunities. Its features, including a play-to-earn game in beta testing and 90% APY staking rewards , make it more than just another crypto. It’s a utility-packed asset with the potential for massive growth. Here’s a scenario to consider: If you invest $20,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013, you’d receive approximately 153.8 million $BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits its post-presale price of $0.0006, your investment could be worth $92,307. That’s a jaw-dropping 361% return on investment! But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin’s growing community of over 6,100 “bulls” is a testament to its appeal. The coin has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, and its presale success shows no signs of slowing down, making it one of the best meme coins to buy this week. Crypto All-Stars: Presale Hits $25M and Ends Today If you’ve been following meme coins this year, you’ve probably heard about Crypto All-Stars. This project has captured the market’s attention with its MemeVault Protocol, a revolutionary staking platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins like Dogecoin, PEPE, and Floki. It’s the first of its kind—a multi-token, multi-chain staking platform that rewards users for holding $STARS, the platform’s native token. At a presale price of $0.0016782 per token, investors have had the chance to secure $STARS and start earning staking rewards, with APYs as high as 141%. As the presale wraps up today, Crypto All-Stars has already raised a staggering $25M, cementing its place as one of the biggest successes of 2024. Now, as the presale concludes, many Crypto All-Stars investors are looking to reinvest their gains, and BTFD Coin is emerging as a natural next step. With its promising presale performance and bullish community, BTFD Coin is proving to be the perfect dip for Crypto All-Stars holders to own. Shiba Inu: Expanding Across Blockchains Shiba Inu is no stranger to making waves in the crypto world. Its recent partnership with Chainlink has taken things to a whole new level by integrating the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) into Shibarium, its layer-2 solution. This move allows Shiba Inu tokens—BONE, LEASH, and TREAT—to function seamlessly across 12 blockchains, vastly increasing their utility and appeal. This kind of technological innovation isn’t just impressive—it’s essential. By expanding its ecosystem, Shiba Inu is positioning itself as a leader in cross-chain functionality, which is a major step forward for the entire meme coin space. Despite recent price fluctuations, Shiba Inu’s commitment to innovation and its global community make it a strong contender for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio with meme coins that have real-world use cases. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, Crypto All-Stars, Shiba Inu, and BTFD Coin are the top picks for investors this week. Crypto All-Stars’ presale is ending today, and its innovative platform will undoubtedly shape the future of meme coins. Shiba Inu’s cross-chain capabilities demonstrate its staying power in a competitive market. And BTFD Coin’s presale success, combined with its community-driven approach, makes it a standout choice among the best meme coins to buy this week to secure massive returns. If you’re ready to join the bulls and seize this opportunity, join the BTFD Coin meme coin presale now. With only a few stages left and the price set to climb, there’s no better time to invest in one of the most promising meme coins of 2024.

37901852,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321714,1734739944,Crypto Crash Hits Cardano Hard – Can ADA Hold $1 and Start 2025 Strong?,"The latest crypto market crash has hit Cardano (ADA) hard, but the worst might already be over, and bulls will be hoping that the cryptocurrency is still headed for a positive start to 2025. Cardano (ADA) cratered as low as $0.76 on Friday, taking its pullback from recent highs to more than 40% at the time. The Fed triggered a major stock and crypto market sell-off when they issued more-hawkish-than-expected guidance for only two additional rate cuts in 2025 on Wednesday. What just happened? The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points which is exactly what 97% of market participants wanted. But, the S&P 500 just posted its largest post-Fed drop since March 2020, erasing $1.8 TRILLION of market cap. Why? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 Since the Fed’s bearish meeting, ADA futures positions worth nearly $20 million have been liquidated, per coin glass.com . However, Cardano’s strong recovery from intra-day lows in the $0.76 area to around $0.95, which has seen ADA also reclaim its 50DMA, suggests the worst might be over. ADA is currently on course to close out a bullish hammer candlestick for this session. And with macro set to take a back seat into the year’s end, with no further major US economic data releases or Fed events, focus is likely to return to bullish “adoption” talking points. And Cardano has a few highly bullish narratives running in its favor right now. Here is why the price is likely to reclaim $1.0 and start 2025 on the front foot. Cardano Is Likely to Retake $1 and Start 2025 Strong, Here’s Why Trump’s election victory last month sparked a major rally in crypto, but Cardano was one of the strongest performers. That’s because Cardano has been one of the most beaten down cryptocurrencies by the current SEC, who classified it as an unregistered security in 2023 in lawsuits versus Binance and Coinbase. The Trump administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history – the treasury secretary is pro-crypto, there is a new Crypto/AI czar and the incoming SEC chair is also a friend to the industry. Moreover, Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hopkinson may also end up advising the incoming administration. This is a game changer for Cardano, which has until now struggled to garner substantial adoption for its blockchain when compared to rivals like Ethereum and Solana . Cardano proponents are urging the Cardano Foundation to match Ripple’s massive donation to Trump’s inauguration to ensure their spot as a key player in future policy discussions. Cardano should absolutely be donating to Donald Trump’s inaugural fund Match Ripple Cardano needs to do everything possible to be a key player in all of the policy discussions about the future of finance This could encourage even more dialogue & cooperation with policymakers https://t.co/bt6sZJgQ5m — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 20, 2024 Meanwhile, Cardano hopes to accelerate the adoption of its blockchain by transforming itself into the go to BTC DeFi chain by mid-2025. BREAKING NEWS: BITCOIN IS COMING TO CARDANO MAY 2025 – CHARLES ""We're going to get Bitcoin on cardano at most likely may 2025"" Are you not excited? pic.twitter.com/i0SxJdpMhp — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) December 19, 2024 A lot of traders have lined up to short Cardano around $1, per a Tweet from Deezy.eth. That raises the risk of a short-squeeze that could see ADA quickly retake years highs in the $1.30 area should the current recovery accelerate. Looking into 2025, assuming the incoming pro-crypto administration and Congressional session delivers on all the talk, the arrival of a new golden age for crypto could send ADA skyrocketing. A retest of record highs above $3 is certainly a possibility. Cardano Alternative to Consider While Cardano could be setting up for 3x gains in 2025, investors looking to secure larger gains might instead want to consider getting involved in meme coin markets. Well-known meme coins like Dogecoin , Pepe and dogwifhat could all offer between 5-10x upside potential. Alternatively, newer and lesser-known meme coins , whilst riskier, could offer substantially greater upside potential. One meme coin that the team at cryptonews.com is a big fan of is a fun new gamified cat token called Catslap (SLAP) . This highly promising meme coin has already been able to reach a market cap of over $14 million per DEXTools . The meme coin is running a massive $1,000,000 giveaway to users who accumulate the most slap points. With a new meme season likely to hit as markets recover into the year’s end, SLAP could be one of the best-performing memes.

On the other hand, Shiba Inu’s technical analysis shows a decline in momentum as its burn rate plummeted by 99.84%, signaling reduced demand and wavering confidence. BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with superior mining efficiency, having sold over 14,919 mining rigs and accruing over $6 million from these sales. The network’s X1 Miner, combined with the efficient X10 Miner, boosts rewards by 10x, presenting an exceptional chance for users to enhance their earnings effortlessly. This interesting pairing positions BlockDAG among the best crypto miners. Stacks Crypto Prediction: Will It Hit $3.80 by 2025? Stacks (STX) is progressing slowly but surely, consolidating around pivotal levels. Recent support at $2.06 demonstrates resilience, with Stacks crypto’s prediction foreseeing a rise to $3.80 by 2025. Its gradual ascent might not attract those seeking faster results. While the Stacks crypto prediction suggests the potential for sustained gains, its dependence on cautious, low-risk development may not captivate those drawn to swift innovation. Moreover, the current resistance at $2.31 acts as an impediment, stalling further advances. Shiba Inu Technical Analysis: Burn Rate Plummets by 99.84% Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces challenges as its burn rate has sharply fallen by 99.84%, with only 112,182 tokens recently burned. This significant drop indicates a slump in demand, as seen in its daily volume dwindling to $604 million, trailing behind its meme coin rivals. Recent Shiba Inu technical analysis points to possible recovery patterns, supported by an ascending channel and crucial moving averages. Although a rebound could occur, the diminishing demand and declining confidence question whether SHIB still stands as the best crypto to buy now. Combine BlockDAG’s X1 & X10 Miners for 10X Rewards!
