The exchange – which lost nearly 440 bitcoins in mid-April in an incident that has been publicly blamed on a ""rogue"" employee – announced on April 29 that while it previously hoped to begin returning customer funds by this point, it remains unable to do so because of a police investigation.  The statement continued:  ""When investigations are underway, we don't have much of a say and do need permissions from the authorities to start the compensation process, which we are yet to receive. We will update you when we have definite dates around the start of the process.""  New contracts will be issued to all customers for both Indian rupees and bitcoin, Coinsecure went on to write, without elaborating.  Coinsecure previously blamed chief security officer Amitabh Saxena for allegedly exposing the exchange's private keys while trying to distribute bitcoin gold, a cryptocurrency offshoot of bitcoin, to customers, as previously reported. At the time, chief executive Mohit Kalra said ""our customers will be indemnified from our company's funds,"" but cautioned it might take time to recover the stolen coins.  The company later announced that if all of the stolen bitcoins were recovered, customers would be repaid fully in the cryptocurrency, but otherwise, they would be paid in a mix of bitcoins and rupees. In particular, Coinsecure announced that 90 percent of the funds would be repaid in rupees according to the price on April 9. At the time, the token was trading at under $7,000, but has rallied to just under $9,000 as of press time.  ""Please do bear with us as we are working on multiple fronts to resolve the issues at hand at the earliest for our users,"" this weekend's statement explained.

As of press time, the post has yet to be taken down by Twitter staff. According to data from Blockchain, no transactions were found for the address listed by the compromised account.  Other accounts have been targeted by would-be scammers hoping to use publicly notable accounts in order to dupe crypto-holders.

42380635,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yVrH,1525201240,Up 33%: Bitcoin's Price Just Had Its Best Month of 2018,"Bitcoin's price rose 33 percent against the U.S. dollar in April, making it the best month of 2018 for the world's largest cryptocurrency.  Data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) shows that May began with bitcoin's price at the $9,244.32 mark – a 33 percent jump from its April 1 start of $6,926.02. This marks the greatest rise in bitcoin's price this year, and one of only two months where it rose at all within the period.  Bitcoin's price fell overall in January and March, and only rose 1.4 percent in February, according to BPI data.  Indeed, bitcoin fell by nearly a third in each of the negative months, dropping from $13,860 on January 1 to $10,166 on February 1, and even more drastically – from $10,309 to just below $7,000 – in March. While bitcoin has rallied this past month, it has yet to recover to the $10,000 mark, which it last fell below in mid-March.  That being said, these numbers hide the fact that bitcoin actually rose to past $17,000 in January before falling by nearly half to its February 1 level.  Similarly, bitcoin reached a low below $6,000 before recovering, as shown by the BPI. In other words, while it may have begun spending periods of time trading sideways, it remains volatile year-to-date.  Notably, bitcoin's transaction volume jumped by 93 percent month-over-month, while the number of off-chain transactions through exchanges jumped by a similar 95 percent. However, fees saw a similar jump, rising 90 percent in April, according to data collected by CoinDesk.  Bitcoin derivatives had a similarly positive month. Both the CBOE and CME saw their futures contracts trading volume spike this month, with CBOE in particular seeing more than 18,000 contracts traded in a single day on April 25, as previously reported.  Similarly, CME saw more than 11,000 contracts traded that day, roughly double its daily average.

Tweeting that  ""sharding is coming,"" Buterin shared a new code repository that documents a partial proof-of-concept for what is called the ""fork choice rule,"" the code for how ethereum shards interact with the main blockchain.  As detailed by CoinDesk, the sharding approach aims to split ethereum into several concurrent networks, allowing the network as a whole to scale more efficiently. This would help ease the congestion the network faces, thereby increasing transaction speeds and lowering costs.  The tweet was accompanied by an image of a simulation of 12 shards in action.  Speaking on Reddit, Buterin said that a sharded ethereum will likely contain around 100 shards, each with as much capacity, ""and likely more,"" the developer wrote, than the main ethereum blockchain.  Buterin also noted that the new sharding code will be fused with ethereum once its upcoming switch to proof-of-stake, Casper, is in its final stage.  The news comes at a time when the platform is faced with increasing pressure to scale to keep up with increasing demand. Speaking at Deconomy conference in Seoul, South Korea last month, Buterin said that ethereum applications are ""screwed"" by current scaling challenges.  Buterin continued to tweet several further documents, including an early stage sharding specification, that forms an early picture of the new protocol.

Brin wrote Saturday that several factors have led to a surge in computing power that has seen search giant Google's own processors speed up by a factor of 200,000 over a period of 20 years. The first factor is the ""steady hum of Moore's Law,"" referring to the observation that computing power per square inch of a chip tends to double every other year.  The second factor is increased demand for processing heft, partly from gamers and their graphics-hungry rigs but also ""surprisingly, from the GPU-friendly proof-of-work algorithms found in some of today's leading cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum.""  GPUs, or graphics processing units, are used to ""mine"" ether: to update the cryptocurrency's blockchain through a process known as proof of work, which involves rapidly crunching through cryptographic functions. (Ethereum miners may not use GPUs for much longer, however, given that a specialized piece of hardware has been developed by Bitmain)  Brin did not feel either of these factors was the biggest contributor to the computing ""boom,"" however. That factor, he wrote, is machine learning, a data-intensive technique used to develop artificial intelligence systems that can drive cars, recognize faces or translate texts without human input.  Google has explored uses for blockchain technology, the cryptographic structures that underpin cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum, but has made very little mention of cryptocurrencies themselves - except to ban browser extensions for mining and ads for initial coin offerings.

Unveiled Tuesday, the deal will see the two firms collaborate on a public network based on Hashgraph, a kind of distributed ledger technology (DLT) created by the software company Swirlds. CULedger had previously said that it would work with the private version of Hashgraph as a way to connect the group of credit unions backing the blockchain effort.  Indeed, the latest development signifies that CULedger, which has been a focal point for work around the tech within the U.S. credit union industry, is looking to expand the kinds of services it seeks to offer. The Hedera Hashgraph will be paired with a new global identity solution, MyCUID, in an effort to build what CULedger calls ""a comprehensive system"" for identity and global payments.  Rick Cranston, COO of CULedger, explained that the current system for facilitating cross-border payments is a ""painful"" process for parties involved, due to its high costs, limited visibility into transactions and the time involved in actually getting money from one point to another.  He went on to say:  ""Hashgraph is fast and it provides visibility between the two parties at a significantly lower cost. It also eliminates concerns regarding fraud and default, since transactions are recorded immutably on the public ledger, and manual processes, since transactions are automated via smart contracts.""

Announced Monday, BankDhofar, an Oman-based financial investment management company, has joined RippleNet, a move the bank says enables it to provide global cross-border payments using Ripple's blockchain technology, a press release states.  As such, the move is the latest that finds BankDhofar among an early set of blockchain movers in the Middle East. Earlier this year, BankDhofar joined Bankchain, a consortium of over 27 banks that was launched in February 2017 to explore blockchain solutions for the banking sector.  Dr. Tariq Taha, chief information officer at BankDhofar, commented:  ""With this, we can provide instant, frictionless and secure cross border money transfers within seconds, with end-to-end visibility over the journey of the payment.""  BankDhofar notably did not say which Ripple products it is seeking to use to tap those benefits, nor if it was open to using XRP Ledger, the open-source codebase that utilizes the XRP cryptocurrency.  Still, the recent entrance into RippleNet blockchain network is a part of BankDhofar’s larger effort ""Together 2020,"" which aims in positioning the bank in the lead in the Gulf region.  ""This initiative is part of BankDhofar’s continuous transformation plan, which is putting digital technology and innovation at the core of its strategy to improve the experience of its customers,"" the release concluded.

(It’s possible that we may even be blockchains). And certainly there's no better place that blockchains can solve a real-world problem than here at CoinDesk.  Let's face it, today's reporters struggle to cover the cryptocurrency space. From not using every article to highlight the benefits of HODLing to letting some nocoiners just show up and yap FUD, we know our reporters have really held the industry (at least the price) back.  In fact, we’re so open to the idea of change, we’d like to take on a suggestion from ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, who kindly told CoinDesk of our coverage last week:  ""This is why pundits need to be replaced by prediction markets, ASAP.""  After all, who really needs people asking questions about the industry's totally-not-broken governance model, its definitely-not-hypocritical private token sales or its absolutely-not-redundant-or-esoteric debates?  As such, we're happy to announce our token DeskCoin.*  Where's the white paper? We've got a trendier plan. What the people really want, even before basic facts about the project, is highfalutin booze, drugs and an immersive experience that will cause severe sensory overload!  We’re talking about a coin launch party, bros.  Because what good is having immutable record-keeping and shared digital trust if you can’t kick it off with a rip-roaring banger? Amirite?  Think machine-learning robots in a fully autonomous yogurt shop. Look, we know you've thought about that before, so we turned it up a notch - pairing the technology with actual pseudoscience. We'll have palm readers and Reiki and lots of lots of crystals (mostly amethyst because it's an all-purpose healing stone and let's be clear, we have no idea what our purpose is).  Even better, all we have to do is look to what the state-of-the-art projects are really, actually, already, we’re-totally-not-making-this-up doing for ideas.  So before you make millions on DeskCoin (name not final - we might change it to something ""dope""), we've lined up an event that's sure to leave you mesmerized and also slightly hungover.    ***      NOTE: THE GUEST LIST IS CLOSED  (JK, you can totally invest in the coin at the door.)      ***      The best ways to escape the lingering feeling of dread after watching the price charts...      ***      Healing EDM      WHAT: Tracklist includes all the crypto hits – ""(Airdrop) it Like it's Hot,"" ""Get Your Fork On"" and ""All About That Basecoin""  WHO: A DJ whose name has exactly two letters.

In a statement published May 1, the agency said that it is ""issuing inquiries to ICO issuers and their advisers where we identify conduct or statements that may be misleading or deceptive."" Additionally, the securities watchdog suggested that it was moving to halt unlicensed activity as well.  ""As a result of our inquiries, some issuers have halted their ICO or have indicated the ICO structure will be modified,"" ASIC disclosed, though it didn't say how many token sales have been canceled or changed in light of the agency's actions.  ASIC commissioner John Price explained:  ""If you are acting with someone else’s money, or selling something to someone, you have obligations. Regardless of the structure of the ICO, there is one law that will always apply: you cannot make misleading or deceptive statements about the product. This is going to be a key focus for us as this sector develops.""  As CoinDesk previously reported, the move was perhaps expected. Price spoke about token sales on April 27, declaring the agency's intention to focus on overseas-based ICOs that target would-be Australian investors.  ""I cannot stress enough that if you are doing business here and selling something to Australians - including issuing securities or tokens to Australian consumers - our laws here can apply,"" Price said at the time.  In Tuesday's statement, ASIC indicated that it would be scrutinizing a popular aspect of ICO marketing – the white paper – as it looks into whether those behind such sales are in compliance with Australian law.  ""In one recent example, ASIC took action to protect investors where we identified fundamental concerns with the structure of an ICO, the status of the offeror and the disclosure in its white paper,"" the agency explained.

42380622,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yVeh,1525163697,UNDP Partners With Crypto Startup on Solar Power Pilot,"Blockchain startup Sun Exchange has partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on a pilot program that seeks to bring solar power to a university in Moldova.  The solar cells will be owned by individuals around the world and leased to the recipient university, which allows the school to save on the costs of building the equipment, according to a blog post. Notably, the cells' owners will be paid exclusively in cryptocurrency.  Sun Exchange chief executive Abe Cambridge said the university would lease the cells for 20 years, during which time whoever owns them would receive some amounts of bitcoin, solarcoin and the startup's own crypto token as compensation. The ""buy-to-lease"" platform allows these individuals to pay for the cost of building and the installation of the solar cells, which sell for under $10 apiece.  While the UN blog post mentions the Technical University of Moldova as a likely recipient for the pilot program, the actual school has not yet been determined, Cambridge told CoinDesk. However, the panels are scheduled to begin generating power within the next three months.  While right now the startup helps people purchase and lease the cells, Cambridge ultimately wants the cells to be directly tradeable on exchanges through a representative token, he said, adding:  ""Our goal is to tokenize the solar cell so they can be traded on exchanges. That's going to be a non-fungible token and for the moment we can’t see that working under the current state of blockchain development [but] we want the solar cells to be accessed and referenced by digital transfers.""  The startup is helping people become familiar with trading cryptocurrencies he said, noting that ""a lot of our customers are using bitcoin for the very first time,"" but that ""about three quarters ... ask to be paid back in bitcoin rather than their [fiat] currency.""  If the project is successful, it could be expanded into more nations, he added.  UNDP project manager Dumitru Vasilescu, who is overseeing the pilot program, told CoinDesk that the ""decision to partner with Sun Exchange is based on our understanding of the replicability of their model.""  He said that if the project is successful, ""we will search for replication in countries where UNDP operates.""

42380632,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yVq1,1525161606,Crypto Needs More Than Code to Beat the ASIC Mining Threat,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Cryptocurrency advocates are constantly trying to convince non-experts of the advantages of permissionless blockchains, typically by explaining how a decentralized system of consensus-based record-keeping produces an immutable, censorship-resistant ledger.  But this doesn’t exactly square with reality.  There’s a strong argument that first bitcoin, and now other permissionless cryptocurrencies, have become less decentralized over time, even as their value has grown.  The culprits, many believe, are application-specific integrated circuits – the expensive, super-fast hashing chips known as ASICs, the engines driving the rigs in giant mining farms. They have so affected the market structure of blockchain networks that they are now the source of much division within their communities, stirring debates over potential forks in the code and exposing the need for blockchains to resolve one of their other core challenges: governance.  The reason many crypto purists have a problem with ASICs is that individuals like you and I, using comparatively sluggish PCs or even more powerful graphics cards, can’t compete with the ruthless efficiency with which the ASIC mining farms carry out the proof–of-work consensus test and win bitcoin rewards. If the little guy can’t participate, they argue, the result is re-centralization.  What’s more, there’s a dependency on a dominant chip manufacturer, Bitmain, creating a kind of vulnerable, trusted third-party relationship.  Not everyone sees ASICs as a negative. There’s a security argument, for example, that all that expensive, efficient hashing power makes for a more formidable expenditure barrier for a potential “51-percent attacker” to overcome.  But the sense that ASICs are a danger to the decentralized dream of cryptocurrencies is widespread, which is why creators of different altcoins have made various engineering efforts to stave off the perceived threat.  Short-lived fixes  They’ve designed “ASIC-resistant” proof-of-work algorithms, altering them to require extra memory-based computing tasks beyond the basic hashing function. The idea is that this more complicated, multi-faceted workload depletes the singular advantage of ASICs – which are really just very fast one-trick ponies – and renders it worthless for chipmakers to expend capital developing them.  But in many cases, this is now looking like a temporary fix, as chipmakers seem to be increasingly designing ASICs that can carry out all the tasks assigned by these “memory-hard” algorithms.  These developments are sowing divisions within blockchain communities. Miners working with pre-ASIC devices – mostly graphic processing units, or GPUs – are supporting hard fork measures that would make new ASICs worthless again. But anyone who has invested in the new products is opposed to these anti-ASIC measures. Developers seem split between those who hold an ideological aversion to ASICs and others who support an expansion in network hashing power and efficiency.  This brings us to governance.  It would seem the ideal time for a particular cryptocurrency community to set up its plans for dealing with ASICs – which almost certainly means planning for a hard fork – occurs well before even the prospect of one of the fast chips being created for their particular coin.  In bitcoin’s case, it’s far too late to do anything with the Core code. Even though one part of the community is so obsessed with decentralization that they fought a block-size increase on those grounds, there are such entrenched stakes in ASIC mining that it would be impossible to launch an ASIC-resistant code upgrade.  But even with less-established communities, such as zcash and ethereum, the mere prospect of forthcoming ASICs is prompting divided views, as Rachel Rose O'Leary’s reporting in CoinDesk shows.  Vertcoin's model  What may be needed is something along the lines of what vertcoin has achieved.  Not content to simply build a proof-of-work algorithm that includes tasks favoring GPUs over ASICs, the vertcoin community has also informally agreed upon a kind of pact to fork the code if and when a vertcoin ASIC appears.  So far, the system has worked, perhaps because the mere threat of action by the vertcoin miners is enough to scare off would-be ASIC developers. That threat is backed by the fact that vertcoin has already smoothly forked twice to address issues separate from the ASIC threat.  What I like about the vertcoin solution is that it recognizes effective governance is not just technical. It’s not something you just embed in lines of code. You need that human component.  Until now, this has kept the vertcoin mining community more or less solely using GPUs, which as lead developer James Lovejoy explained during a debate about ASICs at MIT with sia lead developer David Vorick, is a great equalizer.  This is due to the fact that GPUs are relatively inexpensive and have uses beyond monolithic cryptocurrency mining. Whether to run a gaming solution or to mine a different coin, GPUs have a life after crypto, and that mitigates the cost of capital expenditure for all.  But Vorick countered that this solution is far from perfect. Eventually, he argued, the economics of GPU mining could become so profitable that it would attract a dominant player, reintroducing third-party risks.  Social compact  What’s needed is what Lovejoy terms “generalized commodity hardware,” a greater degree of availability for a form of GPU mining equipment anyone can use.  But how does one achieve that goal if the tendency is toward monopoly powers and dependence on a single company, whether it’s a GPU producer like Nvidia or an ASIC maker like Bitmain?  This, too, is where human governance matters.  At the extreme end would be government intervention, such as anti-trust regulations. But that kind of defeats the purpose of cryptocurrencies. A better approach would be for communities to develop self-organized models of internal regulation and market structuring.  Drawing again from the vertcoin example, miners and users could, say, agree to steer funds into mining equipment built on open-source standards or committed to commodity-like status.  Whatever the solution to achieving decentralized mining, it appears to lie in combining on-chain software rules with another set of rules based in off-chain agreements.  In other words, combining the protocol layer with the human layer.  Bitcoin mining farm image via Shutterstock.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | FORKS,Michael J.

Indeed, a series of proposals targeted at controversial topics – lost fund recovery, the ether supply rate and the emergence of new mining hardware – have sparked questions within its developer ranks of late about how to coordinate messaging and find consensus among the often conflicting attitudes about the protocol's roadmap.  Most recently, several developers even went so far as to worry such divisions could have broader repercussions after a new proposal, EIP 999, was introduced that some feared could lead to the creation of two incompatible blockchains.  And while many prominent developers, including software creator Vitalik Buterin, are pushing back on the idea that a split is probable, it remains a technical possibility, both because of the extent of the disagreement and the fact that anyone who runs the code is capable of choosing to fork off the network to take advantage of it at any time.  What's more, understanding just how probable such an event could be is becoming a technical challenge of its own.  Not only are developers divided, but the wider community also seemed splintered on the subject, with a ""coin-voting"" websitehttps://www.etherchain.org/coinvote – a web page that enables ethereum users to vote on topics based on the number of ether coins they have – showing a nearly even distribution of those for and against.  Infighting on social media displays much the same sentiment.  ""Right now, we are all working off signaling, which is a really imperfect way to determine the needs of the community,"" Ashley Tyson of the Web3 Foundation, which lost $210 million in the Parity fund freeze, told CoinDesk. ""You can monitor Reddit or Twitter, [but that doesn’t] necessarily provide an accurate reflection of the community,"" she said.  However, the problem isn't unique to ethereum.  Indeed, bitcoin developers, miners, startups and users have aired competing views at various times in the cryptocurrency's history, most notably during the scaling debate (which in August last year, came to a head with some members of the community breaking off the main chain to form a competing cryptocurrency).  The issue seems to stem from developer conversations often occurring on platforms like GitHub and within channels and meetings where technical discussions take place. As such, it can be challenging for a non-technical audience to keep up, prompting concerns more novice users haven't yet been properly represented.  And while not all software changes have a direct impact on the average user - they're often just simple optimizations to improve the platform in discrete ways - some notable voices believe it's important for a variety of stakeholders to have a say when it comes to more contentious changes, generally those that could have an impact on the core values of the system.  “You can't create a governance process without actively involving all participants,” Péter Szilágyi, an ethereum core developer, told CoinDesk.  And speaking to the process of architecting systems in a way that everyone's happy, he continued:  “As long as people feel something is being forced on them, they will fight it. Build something together that's beneficial to both sides, and everyone will consider it an upgrade.”  Imperfect signals  If it's not obvious from the fierce debates and vitriol spewed throughout the crypto community over the past few years, that's easier said than done.  And currently, the only way to measure community sentiment to get that done is through social media channels and coin-voting sites.  While the chatter on social media can serve as a useful metric for gauging how the community feels about a particular topic, there are issues with this method as well. Trolls run rampant and fake accounts spam and manipulate, each spurred by possible financial gain or a simple willingness to escalate controversy.  Because of this, at a developer meeting last week, Jutta Steiner, CEO of Parity Technologies, which supports the proposal that last week so divided users, warned that social media could give the wrong impression of how deep the controversy over these topics actually runs, potentially adding fire to sensitive issues.  Speaking on EIP 999, Steiner said, “I’m not convinced that [EIP 999] is as contentious as it sometimes seems on social media.”  She added:  “I think it’s a pretty important point actually because often at the moment conclusions are drawn based on social media and it’s not the only space.”  While the mob mentality that proliferates on social media can be an effective way of getting your voice heard, it tends to silence subtler arguments and it's unclear whether these mobs are even ethereum users, much less real people.  “Who knows how many multiple usernames one party is using,” Tyson told CoinDesk, asking, “and does that person even represent an ethereum community member?”  Used to try and clear some of the opaqueness up, coin-voting has become another way of measuring ethereum community sentiment. This method was first used heavily after The DAO hack, in an effort to get consensus on whether users wanted to hard fork the blockchain to get victims ether back.  At that time, many criticized the mechanism, saying that the poll was poorly communicated and wasn’t open long enough for ether holders to properly respond. Plus, because the weighting of a particular vote is relative to how much stake - or quantity of ether - a user holds, some argue it puts too much control in the hands of the ether rich.  Coin-voting mechanisms deal with the same criticisms today.  “Minority voices, no matter how valid they may be, are never heard,” Afri Schoedon, a communication officer at Parity, told CoinDesk, adding:  “The more money you have the more you can control the result.”  Finding solutions?  And there’s no easy solution at hand, although several developers and groups are trying.  For instance, as detailed by CoinDesk, several developers have started a working group named the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians that relies both on a dedicated forum and in-person meetups to coordinate changes to the platform. Yet while the group strikes a median between the core developer community and other interested parties, it still doesn't fully encompass the broader community.  That said, several ethereum members are knuckling down.  For one, core developer Nick Johnson has migrated the ethereum GitHub repository onto a dedicated webpage that highlights the various code proposals in a more accessible manner.  Member of the ethereum magicians Lane Rettig has also expressed his commitment to better communicating the processes of ethereum governance in a blog post, stating that his vision of ethereum is as ruled by “rational, constructive, well-intentioned, economically incentivized human beings brought together by selfish and selfless inclinations alike.”  As such, at the ethereum educational conference EDCON this week, Rettig has organized a workshop where he hopes to break down the network's governance basics and the philosophical assumptions behind these mechanisms.  And still, there might be even more creative solutions on the horizon.  For instance, core developer Alex Van de Sande proposed a code change that he believes might solve all the contentious topics - fund recovery, ether issuance and ASIC mining - that are being debated right now.  Because ethereum developers are looking to change the consensus mechanism of the protocol to proof-of-stake, eliminating proof-of-work mining, Van de Sande suggests sending all future ether issuance to a smart contract, which acts as a kind of insurance policy for the community. In the event of lost ether, the pool can be used to make users that lost whole again.  About the proposal, Van de Sande writes, “It should be seen as a platform to settle disputes to avoid the implementation of contentious hard forks, not as a means to remove the power of users and developers to execute them.”  Still, the proposal has not been broadly accepted.  As such, Web3's Tyson concluded:  “We don't have the answers to these questions. But I hope that as a community we can begin to understand the questions and define the answers.”  Broken phone image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/01/why-ethereum-cant-tell-what-its-users-want,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e26b9df00dee574657b16c135c45178ff358de8d-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
