The popular altcoin has also been usurped by Tron (TRX), marking a significant shift in the crypto market. Cardano’s Fall From Grace According to reports from CoinMarketCap, Cardano has dropped out of the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The popular altcoin lost its long-standing position following significant price declines over the past week, which reduced its market capitalization to around $12.3 billion. Bill Morgan, a popular crypto enthusiast and analyst has also commented on the cryptocurrency’s recent fall from grace. Related Reading: Cardano Down 50% In 4 Months: Sellers Unrelenting, Best Time To Buy ADA? Cardano, once ranked top three amongst all cryptocurrencies during the bull run in 2021 has been experiencing drastic price declines due to widespread market correction. Over the past few months, Cardano’s price has consolidated around the $0.3 mark, witnessing only slight upticks during stable market conditions. Generally, Cardano’s price fundamentals have been somewhat weak, dropping by a whopping 58.6% from its March 2024 price high. Atomic Wallet analysts have also noted that ADA has been on a major downward trend, plummeting by over 90% since around September 2021. The analysts also suggest that ADA’s downward spiral began following the launch of its smart contracts. Responding to Atomic Wallet analysts, Dave, a Cardano development and DEX enthusiast, has highlighted that the altcoin is significantly undervalued. Despite the ongoing developments in its network and the upcoming Chang hard fork, Cardano continues to experience price and adoption stagnation. Although the cryptocurrency’s drop from the top 10 cryptocurrencies may be disheartening for many in its community, various members still remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s future outlook. One Cardano supporter pointed out that the cryptocurrency had previously fallen as low as 17th in market capitalization on March 27, 2020. Yet, within a year, it rebounded dramatically to the top four during the bull cycle in 2021, demonstrating its potential for recovery and growth. Tron Replaces Cardano In Top 10 Additionally, crypto analyst, KingCryptoAryan on X has shared a rather ambitious forecast for Cardano, expecting the cryptocurrency to surge as high as $75 soon. At the time of writing, the price of Cardano is trading at $0.34, recording a slight 3.10% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Cardano Analyst: ADA To 2X After Breakout, Chang Hard Fork As Tailwinds? Cardano’s fall from the top 10 cryptocurrencies has effectively pushed the rankings of Tron (TRX) upwards. Presently, Tron has replaced Cardano to become the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Tron’s market capitalization is now estimated at approximately $12.7 billion, exceeding Cardano’s by about $400 million. At the time of writing, TRX is trading at $0.146, marking a 6.84% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

32642144,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636638,1724189425,"Bitcoin Recovers To $61,000, Here Are The Possible Reasons","Bitcoin has made a recovery back towards the $61,000 level during the past day. Here are the factors that could be behind this surge. Bitcoin Has Made Some Recovery During The Last 24 Hours After showing lackluster price action under $60,000 during the past few days, Bitcoin has finally shown some momentum in the last 24 hours, with its price surging by more than 4%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Now Doing Loss-Taking: Sign That A Turnaround Is Near? The chart below shows how the cryptocurrency’s recent trajectory has looked like. At the peak of this rally, BTC had broken above $61,400, but the asset has since seen a pullback. Nonetheless, even after the drawdown, BTC is still trading around $60,800, which is a notable improvement over yesterday. As for what could be behind this surge, perhaps on-chain data can provide some hints. BTC Has Seen Multiple Positive On-Chain Developments Recently There are a couple of developments that have occurred in the cryptocurrency space recently that could be positive for Bitcoin. First, according to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, BTC investors carrying between 100 and 1,000 BTC have made a considerable buying push during the last six weeks. At the time Santiment had shared the chart (which was yesterday), the Bitcoin investors with 100 to 1,000 BTC had held a combined 3.97 million tokens. Out of this, 94,700 coins were bought by them within the past six weeks. The cohort with wallets in this range is popularly known as the “sharks.” Along with the whales, the sharks are considered the key investors in the market, due to the considerable scale of coins that they hold. Thus, the fact that these large investors were accumulating while BTC had been struggling earlier shows that big money was confident that the cryptocurrency would turn itself around. The other positive development has been the uptrend that the supply of Tether (USDT) has been showing recently, as analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out in an X post. Investors generally use stablecoins like Tether whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin. Such investors who store their capital like this, however, eventually plan to venture back into the volatile coins, so the supply of the stablecoins may act as a store of dry powder available for deploying into BTC and others. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Still In A Bull Market,” Quant Says—Here’s Why Naturally, when investors do swap their stables for these assets, their prices observe a bullish boost. With Tether’s supply having seen a sharp jump recently, the investors’ potential purchasing power could be considered to have gone up. This could have happened through two processes: a rotation of capital from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and fresh capital inflows. The former would imply investors have sold their volatile coins for now, but as mentioned before, these investors may buy back into the market in the future. The latter would be entirely bullish, as it would mean there is fresh interest entering into the space. In reality, both of these likely occurred to some degree and as Bitcoin has managed to find a rebound, it’s possible new capital inflows have made up for more of the increase.

Ansari ultimately took the seat by only 39 votes from a candidate who had been backed by staunch crypto critic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.  Another crypto fan is likely to arrive in Congress next year, with Yassamin Ansari winning her Democratic primary race in Arizona by a scant 39 votes, a result confirmed Tuesday after an automatic recount. Ansari, a former vice mayor of Phoenix, will move on to the general election in a district that strongly favors Democrats, so her chances are good to join the growing list of members of Congress who favor friendly regulations for the U.S. digital assets sector.  In the days after the July 30 primary in that state, her lead over her Democratic opponent – Raquel Terán, who was backed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) – slid from a 67-vote advantage to 42 and finally came in at 39 after the tally was checked again under court supervision.

Fairshake and its affiliated super PACs have now turned to the November general election, committing money in as many as 21 congressional races so far.

32639164,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636671,1724184038,Bitcoin On Brink Of Massive Breakout Like Gold In 2008: Hedge Fund CEO,"In the latest edition of the Capriole Investments newsletter dated August 20, 2024, Charles Edwards, founder and CEO, draws striking parallels between the current market behavior of Bitcoin and the historical performance of Gold, particularly during its 2008 rally. Bitcoin Mirrors 2008 Gold Rush Edwards points out that Bitcoin has been consolidating around $60K, echoing the pattern Gold followed before its significant rally. “Bitcoin is under pressure, mirroring the longest period of consolidation at any ATH in its history,” Edwards notes, suggesting that this could be a precursor to a significant breakout. According to him, this pattern closely mirrors that of Gold in the late 2000s, when it consolidated for nine months around its 1980 ATH before launching a significant two-year rally in 2008. Edwards elaborates on the technical similarities, noting, “Gold’s first significant consolidation post-ETF launch preceded a rally that saw its value climb by 180% in just over two years. Today, Bitcoin exhibits similar market behavior in the aftermath of its own ETF launches and consolidations.” Related Reading: Over 80% of Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Underwater — What This Means For BTC Edwards notes that during Gold’s consolidation phase in 2008, the asset underwent a -33% drawdown, eventually marking what many investors consider a generational bottom. Bitcoin’s recent dip to $48,000—a -33% crash—strikingly aligns with this aspect of Gold’s historical price action. “The July 2024 Bitcoin dip saw a -28% drop to $53K, and the more recent August 2024 dip mirrored Gold’s final plunge, falling a mere half a percent short,” Edwards states, highlighting the precision of these parallels. Based on these historical parallels, Edwards predicts that Bitcoin price could be “ripping straight to $140K with no dips by around May 2025.” While he acknowledges that a single datapoint does not mean that gold’s history has to repeat for Bitcoin, he believes that it is “the most comparable asset at the most comparable time in its history.” Related Reading: Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin Bull Run Top With Historically Proven Indicator Despite the bullish signal from the historical and technical analysis, Edwards remains only cautiously optimistic. He acknowledges ongoing discrepancies in fundamental data signals and suggests a conservative stance until further bullish confirmations can be observed. “We are still awaiting the Monthly close; the conservative position would be to await further bullish confirmations (and potentially Q4) to fully clear what is typically the most bearish period of each calendar year for Bitcoin and risk assets,” Edwards notes. If Bitcoin can close above the monthly support, Edwards sees a “very attractive technical setup.” He concludes, “I believe this period of market consolidation is coming to a close as we exit summer, and I maintain strong conviction that the next 12 months will be the best time out of the last 3 years to be allocated to this asset class.” At press time, BTC traded at $60,712.

42417396,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYIVJ,1724180987,Faster Computers and Better Algorithms Will Fully Decentralize Blockchains,"Computers are getting much faster and our mathematics skills are getting better too. This combination is starting to reshape blockchains like Ethereum. This will fuel additional scalability as well as leading to much more genuinely decentralized blockchain ecosystems and more powerful smart contracts.  Blockchains today already consume enormous compute resources, but they are still much more centralized and fragile than many of us would like. Advanced protocols depend on large servers, nearly all of which reside in a few powerful cloud ecosystems, and we’re still in the very early stages of developing truly advanced smart contracts.  Ethereum smart contracts today are typically around 24-25kb and many DeFi ecosystem depend on a web of multiple contracts. There’s no reason to think that we can’t see a future where smart contracts are in the megabyte size, including capabilities like embedded machine-learning models or complex decision trees.  The idea that we should have a 25kb limit on smart contracts will, in time, seem as antiquated as the 640kb main memory limit on early PCs.  To understand how these scientific improvements will change the world of blockchains, it’s worth looking at how we got here in the first place: blockchains use lots of computing power in a way that many would have, once upon a time, considered very wasteful. Again, if you go back to the early days of computing, memory and compute resources were so scarce that people left off the half the year number (The “19” in “1985”) to save space. A proof of work system with thousands of parallel processes would have been considered impossibly wasteful. The problem with blockchains is that they get their security and value from re-doing stuff repeatedly. Everyone is checking balances and calculations and verifying them and trying to reach consensus. If you could just pick one trustworthy party to manage the whole process, we could do this all with 99% less effort. The problem is that we are, currently, rather depressingly short of trustworthy central authorities.  Getting everyone to check each other’s results is something we just couldn’t do in the past because there wasn’t enough compute power to go around. I grew up in a home where computer punch-cards used by my parents in computers were always lying around and my parents had to book computer time the way some of us fight for a table at French Laundry. Fortunately, those days are long gone, and while I cannot assemble a program using punch cards, I do know how to make high performance paper airplanes with them.  Moore’s Law, the observation that computing power seems to double every 18 months or so, rescued us from punch cards. The result is that, as times goes, performance goes up at levels that are hard to comprehend. In 1970, you could get about 1,500 circuits on a chip and, by 2020, it was close to 50 billion.  When it comes to blockchains, this means we can trade something that has become very cheap – computing power – for something very valuable, which is trustworthy data and results. The rise of Ethereum has turned this clever trick into an ecosystem full of practical applications, and that transformation is not yet over, because Moore’s law, though slowing down, refuses to die.  It was long expected that Moore’s Law – which says that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years with a little cost increase – would run out of steam sometime this decade. There’s only so small you can make a circuit before the strange effects of quantum mechanics start to make the results unreliable. But that hasn’t happened, yet. The smallest chips use four nanometer-wide circuits today, and the semiconductor industry now has a roadmap to chips with circuits as small as 0.7nm, taking us well into the next decade. (For reference, a silicon atom is 0.2nm wide, which might finally be close to our limit.)  In addition to making faster chips with more logic on them, we’re also getting better at doing mathematics. We’ve become vastly better at a very specific kind of complex mathematical proof that’s critical for blockchains: zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Zero-knowledge proofs are mathematical tools that allow you to prove information is true without revealing the underlying data. This makes it possible to summarize lots of transactions without attaching all the necessary data or to keep the information about those transactions a secret.  ZKPs are essential both to making blockchains handle more transactions as well as enabling privacy for users. The problem with ZKPs is that they are hard to do and need lots of computing power.  In the space of just a few years, ZKPs have gone from proof-of-concept demonstrations to core technologies in the world of blockchain. Part of the credit goes to faster, better, cheaper computers, but it turns out our math skills in this space are improving enormously as well. While nobody has defined a kind of Moore’s Law for ZKPs, our own experience at EY has been very good: the performance of Nightfall, the privacy technology we developed, has improved by a factor of over 10,000 since we unveiled the prototype in 2018.  When we combine improved chip performance with better mathematics, the result should be profound changes to how blockchains operate. The earliest parts of this are already visible: zero-knowledge roll-ups and zero-Knowledge-based virtual machines use advanced math and a lot of computing power to compress and run blockchain transactions on Ethereum. Where we used to need to buy significant server time to run tests of Nightfall, we can now run the latest version on top-of-line laptops.  At the rate things are moving, just about any device, including your phone, should be able to act as a blockchain node and to process transactions on-the-device and not merely sending them into the cloud. You can already do basic ZKP transactions in your browser for chains like Z-Cash. As these capabilities spread, the result could be a much more genuinely decentralized blockchain ecosystem with significantly less centralization of compute-intensive services.  Another significant change may be to increase the allowed size of the largest smart contracts. Today they are limited to 24kb on Ethereum and many of the largest DeFi services need to string together multiple contracts. Allowing bigger smart contracts could simplify services, reduce costs and reduce the opportunities for hackers as well.  For years, we have talked about re-decentralizing the internet. Blockchains have shown us a path forward, but the reality hasn’t always lived up to the hype. Many parts of the Web3 world remain highly centralized. The next iteration of blockchain improvements may give us a new opportunity to achieve extreme levels of genuine decentralization, giving us resilient networks with innovative services. The blockchain evolution is far from over.

32636568,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636827,1724179357,Shiba Iun’s Trading Volume Up 82% Investors Seek More Profit From New Gambling Crypto,"The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to volatility, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently demonstrated its ability to capture investor attention with a significant surge in trading volume. With an 82% increase in trading activity, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has reasserted itself as a major player in the meme coin space. However, as investors become more profit-driven, many are exploring new opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in the emerging sector of gambling-focused tokens like Mpeppe (MPEPE). Shiba Inu’s Impressive Trading Volume Increase Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a remarkable 82% increase in trading volume, signaling renewed interest from investors. This surge is likely driven by a combination of factors, including recent developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem and broader market trends favoring meme coins. The spike in trading volume has propelled Shiba Inu (SHIB) back into the spotlight, reminding the market of its strong community and the potential for significant price movements. This uptick in trading activity is not only a testament to Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) staying power but also highlights the ongoing interest in meme coins. However, while the increased volume suggests that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is far from losing its appeal, it also indicates that investors are actively seeking profits in a rapidly evolving market. The Search for Greater Profit: Why Investors Are Turning to Gambling Cryptos Despite the impressive surge in Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) trading volume, many investors are looking beyond traditional meme coins for greater profit opportunities. This shift in focus is leading to increased interest in gambling-related cryptocurrencies, which offer a unique combination of entertainment and financial gain. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new gambling-focused crypto, is gaining traction as investors seek to diversify their portfolios and tap into the lucrative world of online gambling. Unlike Shiba Inu (SHIB), which has primarily relied on its community and meme appeal, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers direct utility in the gambling sector, providing its holders with access to a booming industry that is projected to exceed $100 billion in the coming years. Mpeppe: A Promising Alternative for Profit-Driven Investors As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to capture headlines with its trading volume surge, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quietly positioning itself as a promising alternative for investors seeking both entertainment and financial returns. Here are three reasons why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is becoming an attractive option for those looking to maximize their profits: Utility in the Gambling Sector: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin; it’s a token with real-world applications in the online gambling industry. This utility provides a more stable foundation for growth, as it is tied to the success of a high-demand sector. Potential for High Returns: While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has already seen significant price increases, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its early stages, offering investors the potential for substantial returns as it gains traction in the market. Diversification Benefits: For investors holding Shiba Inu (SHIB), adding Mpeppe to their portfolio provides diversification into a different sector of the cryptocurrency market, reducing risk while enhancing potential rewards. The Future of Shiba Inu and the Rise of Gambling Cryptos As Shiba Inu (SHIB) enjoys its surge in trading volume, it remains a strong contender in the meme coin space. However, the cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and investors are increasingly drawn to tokens that offer more than just community appeal. The rise of gambling cryptos like Mpeppe (MPEPE) reflects a broader trend where utility and profit potential are becoming key factors in investment decisions. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) ability to maintain its relevance will depend on its capacity to innovate and adapt to changing market dynamics. Meanwhile, Mpeppe is capitalizing on the growing interest in gambling-related cryptocurrencies, offering a new avenue for investors who are eager to explore the intersection of entertainment and finance. Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Investment The surge in Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) trading volume underscores the enduring appeal of meme coins, but it also highlights a market shift toward utility-driven tokens. As investors seek more than just speculative gains, gambling cryptos like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are emerging as attractive alternatives. By combining the excitement of the online gambling industry with the potential for significant financial returns, Mpeppe offers a unique proposition for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolios and capitalize on the next big trend in the market. In this rapidly changing landscape, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) represent two sides of the same coin one rooted in community and meme culture, the other in utility and profit potential. Investors would do well to consider both as they navigate the opportunities and challenges of the cryptocurrency market.

32636439,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636824,1724179181,Shiba Inu Struggles To Compete With Rival Memecoin Mpeppe (MPEPE) As It Offers More Its Holders,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where the market is continuously evolving, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has long been a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts. However, the recent emergence of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is starting to challenge Shiba Inu’s dominance. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) grapples with internal changes and the broader market’s demands, Mpeppe is offering its holders more value and utility, making it a compelling alternative. Shiba Inu’s Internal Shift Towards Decentralization Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been a pioneer in the meme coin space, largely due to its strong community and the leadership of its lead developers, Shytoshi Kusama and Kaal Dhairya. However, recent news suggests a significant shift in the project’s leadership. Kusama and Dhairya have announced plans to step down by the end of the year, transferring control of the network to its community. This move is intended to achieve “true decentralization,” aligning with the original vision of Shiba Inu’s founder, Ryoshi. Shytoshi Kusama emphasized the importance of the community in Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) success, stating, “The genius of Shib is the power of the community.” This transition aims to deepen community-driven governance, allowing the Shiba Inu community to guide the project’s future. While this move is seen as a positive step towards decentralization, it also raises questions about the project’s future direction and the ability of the community to manage the complex challenges of the cryptocurrency market. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Rising Star in the Meme Coin Universe As Shiba Inu (SHIB) undergoes this significant internal transition, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is capitalizing on the opportunity to attract investors looking for more than just community-driven projects. Mpeppe has quickly gained traction in the market by offering its holders unique value propositions that extend beyond the typical meme coin narrative. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned within the online gambling sector, a market that is expected to exceed $100 billion by 2026. This strategic focus gives Mpeppe a clear use case, providing its holders with potential profits that are not solely dependent on market speculation. The token’s integration into the online gambling industry also introduces an element of utility that many meme coins, including Shiba Inu (SHIB), currently lack. The Competitive Edge of Mpeppe Over Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to focus on its community and the upcoming transition to a decentralized model, Mpeppe is offering its holders tangible benefits. Here are three key reasons why Mpeppe is becoming a serious contender in the meme coin space: Utility in Online Gambling: Unlike Shiba Inu (SHIB), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is embedded in the online gambling industry, providing a direct application for its token. This utility is attracting investors who are looking for more than just hype and community-driven projects. Strategic Market Positioning: As Shiba Inu (SHIB) prepares for a major leadership transition, Mpeppe is positioning itself as a meme coin with real-world applications. This strategic focus on a high-growth industry sets Mpeppe apart from other meme coins that rely heavily on community support. Growing Investor Interest: With Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trading at $0.00001387 and undergoing significant internal changes, investors are beginning to explore alternatives like Mpeppe. The latter’s presale has already garnered significant attention, indicating strong market confidence in its potential. The Road Ahead for Shiba Inu and Mpeppe As Shiba Inu (SHIB) moves towards a decentralized future, the project’s success will largely depend on the community’s ability to manage and innovate. The departure of key developers like Shytoshi Kusama and Kaal Dhairya marks a new chapter for Shiba Inu, one that could either strengthen its community-driven model or expose vulnerabilities in its decentralized governance. Meanwhile, Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to build momentum, offering its holders more than just speculative gains. Its integration into the online gambling industry provides a level of utility that sets it apart from other meme coins, including Shiba Inu (SHIB). As investors seek out projects with real-world applications and growth potential, Mpeppe is emerging as a strong competitor in the meme coin market. Conclusion: A New Contender in the Meme Coin Space In conclusion, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a significant player in the meme coin market, its focus on decentralization and community-driven governance may not be enough to keep up with emerging rivals like Mpeppe (MPEPE). As Mpeppe continues to attract investors with its utility and strategic market positioning, it could very well become a dominant force in the meme coin space, offering its holders substantial returns and a more diversified investment opportunity.

Floki Eyes A 46% Price Surge — Analyst,"Floki, the joke coin that used to be very popular, has been going up and down since June. It dropped from a high point of $0.00034 to a low point of $0.00011, a huge 65% loss. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Nears Key Level As Analyst Eyes Over 100% Upside – Details But an 18% rise in the last 24 hours has given experts new hope. They are now speculating on a possible price surge, with some predicting a remarkable 165% growth over the next year. Floki Breakout Looms? “Floki’s price action has received strong support from a descending trend line,” said ZAYK Charts, a popular crypto analyst. The technical pattern is bearish and shows steady selling interest, which has generally kept prices low, but ZAYK has begun to feel the breakout is near. $FLOKI When a breakout happens, we anticipate Massive Bullish wave📈#FLOKI #FLOKIUSDT #Crypto pic.twitter.com/PaLd0rmY1l — ZAYK Charts (@ZAYKCharts) August 19, 2024 In the event that Floki can shatter the resistance zone that has been keeping pressure on its value, it is likely to start a massive bull cycle, which could easily drive the asset’s price by over 46% from its current value, the analyst said. Volatility Indicator Suggests A Likely Change The recent price activity of Floki didn’t go unnoticed by traders. A peak through the Bollinger Bands uncovers a popular volatility indicator on the verge of an interesting period of low volatility, with the bands contracting. Under these circumstances, either upside or downside price movements have sprung. From the current position at the middle band, Floki is likely to consolidate and wait for a cleaner signal of development from market participants. To add to the pressure, its RSI hit the 46.32 figure, meaning it’s sitting in neutral territory—just with a very slight lean towards the oversold camp. Any RSI reading under 50 is a sign of weak market momentum but, considering it still isn’t under 30, Floki might just spend weeks consolidating unless something changes the market dynamics. What Lies Ahead For Floki? The market analysts watch whether or not Floki can hold up this surge. From a price that trades far below the value projected for the next month, of which it’s 230% off the estimate, this highly poses an undervalue situation, and for some market analysts, it may be a cause of an uptrend anytime soon. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Skyrocketing Potential: Could SHIB Surge 500%? The short-term still looks quite lucrative for Floki: a 245% gain is expected to be accrued in the coming three months, which should open the way for a more robust recovery. This could be easily drawn by many traders, with the intention of making profits at low prices. Looking beyond short-term calculations, the price of Floki will continue to move upward. In one year, the investment would be worth 180% more, an absolutely stunning move. Looking one year out, the goal is a target of 167% to the upside.

The company signed a deal with cloud gaming provider Boosteroid that will bring in $2.6 million annually, potentially scaling to $700 million over 5 years. Bit Digital has a strong balance sheet with $315.5 million in total assets, and very little liabilities by comparison. When I last covered Bit Digital ( BTBT ) for Seeking Alpha in early-June, I made the case for why I felt the company was an underappreciated buyout candidate. Since then, the market has received another quarter of performance to assess in addition to a new HPC customer announcement from Bit Digital. In this update, we'll look at the last quarter and highlight some of the key takeaways from a recent partner announcement. Q2-24 Revenue Breakout Q2-24 Highlights (Bit Digital) Bit Digital reported a topline revenue number of $29 million in Q2-24. This was a 220% increase from the same quarter last year in spite of a 23% reduction in the number of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) that the company has mined. Hash rate has grown by 44% over that same period of time - meaning, the company is clearly feeling the impact of Bitcoin's block reward halving. What has been the company's saving grace is HPC service revenue: Q2-24 Earnings (Bit Digital) The HPC segment represented no meaningful revenue in Q2-23 and accounted for about a quarter of the company's revenue in Q1-24. Revenue from that segment is now up to 43% of total revenue as of Q2-24. HPC is clearly the growth driver of the business at this point in time and we've even seen a new client announcement in this category subsequent to the quarter ended June that we'll dig into in a moment. As we've seen with other Bitcoin miners-turned HPC businesses already, the FASB accounting rules are skewing the quarterly net income numbers due to the revaluation of the company's digital assets every three months. If we take away the $11.5 million unrealized loss on digital assets during the month, Bit Digital's quarterly net income would have been negative by about $400k. For a growth company, this is quite impressive in my opinion. Boosteroid Deal In addition to Q2 earnings on August 19th, Bit Digital also announced the signing of a master service agreement with a cloud gaming company called Boosteroid. The initial deal is expected to bring in $2.6 million annually over the course of 5 years. This deal with Boosteroid could potentially scale to $700 million over those same 5 years according to Bit Digital; which represents $140 million in annualized revenue from this single client alone. Boosteroid Game Sampling (Cloudbase) In my opinion, Boosteroid is actually a pretty good fit for a company like Bit Digital and cloud gaming is an exciting area. Boosteroid has an agreement with Microsoft ( MSFT ) for X-box titles on the platform and has plenty of recognizable names according to Cloudbase. However as exciting as the prospect of $700 million over 5 years might be, I don't think it's prudent to assume the max on this agreement. Boosteroid is competing with companies like NVIDIA ( NVDA ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) that have their own cloud gaming services GeForce Now and Luna. Furthermore, Google's ( GOOG ) offering in the space was discontinued in early 2023. The point is, it's a difficult industry, there are of plenty of significantly larger peers, and we're already seeing weakness in NVIDIA's gaming revenue growth story - which might be a signal that shareholder expectations on this Boosteroid deal should probably be managed. Balance Sheet Assets (Bit Digital) Bit Digital continues to have one of the better balance sheets in the public mining equity space. Against just $20.2 million in total liabilities, the company has $315.5 million in total assets. It should be mentioned that at $130.2 million, a large portion of the company's total assets are cryptocurrencies and could swing wildly with the market from quarter to quarter. Including 'Digital assets held in fund,' the total coin treasury for Bit Digital at the end of June was just under $140 million: BTBT Coin Treasury (Bit Digital, Author's Chart) Interestingly, over 70% of this coin treasury was made up of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) as Bit Digital converted some of its BTC to ETH. On the call, CEO Sam Tabar mentioned ETH's setup given spot ETF approvals in the US. He also noted the ETFs lack staking. Given the company's ETH-staking strategy, Bit Digital is theoretically an alternative to spot ETH ETFs for investors who want the asset to generate yield. Regardless of the crypto swaps, Bit Digital has enough cash and digital asset liquidity to pay off liabilities and still have plenty left over to scale HPC solutions should the market demand justify such expense. I need to also note that at 137.4 million shares outstanding as of quarter end, shares have grown by about 28% year to date. Like most miners, the company is clearly opting for share issuance over debt. While this is dilutive to existing shareholders, in my view the HPC revenue growth makes that dilution more palatable than if it were for mining capacity growth due to the diminishing returns from BTC mining over time. Conference Call Considerations Rather than providing full quotes from CEO Sam Tabar, I'll instead share my bullet points from the commentary during the company's Q2 earnings call: Mining at 6.0 EH/s by the end of the year is now unlikely as the company views HPC as the more appropriate path to growth Full-time HPC employees have been hired and will be announced shortly Bit Digital's anchor customer has paused H100 expansion plans This client is assessing its hardware strategy and may opt for the Blackwell B200 chips, which are currently experiencing delays If the client upgrades the contract to the B200s, recognized revenue will be pushed into 2025 but would be greater than the revenue from the H100 contract A $30 million non-refundable pre-payment has been received from this client by Bit Digital earlier this month Management is still forecasting $100 million in annualized HPC revenue by the end of 2024 Investor Takeaways I still like what Bit Digital is doing quite a bit. It seems very clear from where I sit that the company is gravitating more toward an HPC business than a Bitcoin-mining business. While this certainly has disadvantages as the company now has to find and close customers - which is not something it had to do to mine Bitcoin - the long term revenue growth story is much better in my view. I'm intrigued by the company's somewhat contrarian bet on Ethereum. Many, myself included, no longer believe ETH will flip BTC as the top asset in the cryptocurrency market any time soon. In that regard, the large swap from BTC to ETH in treasury is quite a wager. If we take a step back though and just look at BTBT stock based purely on its revenue growth projections, we see a stock that really isn't all that expensive for a growth-stage company. If we annualize the revenue from BTC mining and staking in Q2, assume the company hits its $100 million annualized forecast for HPC revenue, we get $165.5 million in annualized sales. So at a share price of $3.60 with $137.4 million shares outstanding, even after the large rally following Q2 earnings, the stock is trading at just 3x forward sales. Which is very much in-line with the info-tech sector median and well below almost everything in the ""Magnificent Seven."" It's certainly possible growth stalls out or the company misses on forecasts, but I still think BTBT is a buy.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4715954-q2-24-earnings-bit-digital-is-still-a-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32635315.jpeg

42417401,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYIeb,1724174985,About That 'Gary Gensler for Treasury Secretary' Story,"Yesterday, a publication called the Washington Reporter released a bombshell story saying that Kamala Harris was “likely to nominate Gary Gensler as Treasury Secretary if elected.”  Based on unnamed sources, the lede confidently ran: “While publicly, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler hasn’t expressed desire to leave his current role, multiple senior Senate staffers are telling the Washington Reporter that if Vice President Kamala Harris wins in November, she plans to nominate Gensler as her Treasury Secretary.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  If true, this would certainly be a big deal for the crypto industry and beyond.  Gary Gensler is (let’s just say it) universally disliked in crypto for the SEC’s frequent aggressive “enforcement actions” and for his unwillingness to be clear about what is and what isn’t legally permissible when it comes to digital assets.  But is the story true? Let’s take a look at the evidence, and how this “story” may have come about.  It may be true that “multiple senior Senate staffers” believe Gensler could be Treasury Secretary in a Harris administration. Gensler is long believed to have coveted that job and he would certainly be well-qualified: he worked on Wall Street (Goldman Sachs), he’s led both of the country's primary markets regulators (the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission), and he was a professor at MIT. He’s a well-rounded, experienced economic public servant; why wouldn’t he be considered as a Treasury Secretary candidate? Putting aside that Harris needs to win the presidency, a Senate majority and persuade both Democratic and Republican Senators to support his nomination … it’s certainly possible Gensler could get the job next year, though, according to most experts, that is unlikely.  But the story is filled with red flags that any decent editor would immediately mark up with red ink. For example: “Those rumors corroborate what top Republicans have also told the Reporter on the record.” Rumors don’t corroborate anything. And there’s nothing close to a quote from someone close to the Harris camp; the “likely” in the headline all comes from those Senate staffers.  CoinDesk ignored the “story” because it didn’t meet our standards. It contained no on-the-record reporting and nothing from the people who were said to be doing the thing it said they were doing (nominating Gensler).  Moreover, many well-placed folks were immediately suspicious and dismissive:  So, what is this Washington Reporter? It looks and appears like a venerable publication. But read the website a little and you find that it was started by Republican political operatives and its stated objective is this: “We cover stories pushed by interested parties – including lobbyists or operatives with clients – as long as the content is true, fair, and insightful,” the site says. Whatever that means in plain English, it’s clear that the Washington Reporter isn’t journalism. (Axios described its origins here.)  The Gensler-for-Treasury story was certainly compelling, though. And the thing about compelling stories is that they have a way of becoming true even when there’s no truth to them. For instance, The Block, which does solid work daily, picked up the thread and ran a straight “Gensler is being considered for Treasury Secretary” headline. Other well-known reporters tweeted about it (including Unchained’s Laura Shin). Whatever the merits, the story was rapidly becoming true in the retelling.  So, who benefits from all this?  Well, last week, crypto-friendly Democrats made a concerted push to say they could be trusted on crypto policy. Senate leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) promised to pass a crypto bill through the Senate before the end of the year. It looked like Democrats who support crypto might have a home in November.  But what’s the one thing that might stop these crypto people from voting Democrat? Nominating Gary Gensler as Treasury Secretary – just the sort of rumor a political operative might want to spread.

32626172,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636761,1724174377,Crypto Experts Say XRP Will Struggle To Reach $1 and That Investors Should Buy Mpeppe,"As Ripple (XRP) continues to experience fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, many experts are expressing doubts about its ability to reach the much-anticipated $1 mark. Despite a recent uptick in its price, the consensus among analysts is that XRP may face significant challenges in sustaining its upward momentum. In light of these concerns, some investors are turning their attention to alternative opportunities, such as the emerging token Mpeppe (MPEPE), which is gaining traction for its potential to deliver substantial returns. Ripple (XRP) Faces Uncertain Future Despite Recent Gains Ripple (XRP) has recently seen a resurgence in its price, climbing to $0.60 for the first time in ten days and posting a 7.74% increase within 24 hours. This rally aligns with a broader market recovery, making XRP one of the top performers among the leading cryptocurrencies. However, the question remains: can Ripple maintain this momentum and continue its upward trajectory? One positive sign for Ripple (XRP) is the significant decrease in whale-to-exchange transactions. Since August 18, these transactions have dropped tenfold, indicating that large holders of XRP are not in a rush to sell their coins. This reduction in selling pressure has been a crucial factor in XRP’s recent price recovery. However, while the current trend is bullish, the sustainability of this uptrend is uncertain. The increase in on-chain demand for Ripple (XRP) is another encouraging sign. The volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) has surged by 28% in the last 24 hours, suggesting that interest in XRP is growing. Despite these positive indicators, the broader market sentiment remains cautious, with many analysts skeptical about XRP’s ability to reach the $1 milestone. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Is a More Promising Investment Given the uncertainties surrounding Ripple (XRP), many investors are exploring other opportunities that offer the potential for higher returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is one such token that is quickly gaining attention. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently in its presale phase, with a price of $0.001777 USDT. The presale has already raised over $1 million, with more than 70% of the tokens sold. Here’s why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a more attractive investment: High-Growth Market Focus: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to capitalize on the growing online gambling market, which is expected to reach over $100 billion by 2026. This niche focus provides Mpeppe (MPEPE) with a clear use case, setting it apart from other meme coins that rely purely on hype. By targeting a specific, high-growth industry, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers investors the potential for significant returns as the token gains adoption. Strategic Entry Point: With Ripple (XRP) struggling to sustain its recent gains, Mpeppe presents a timely opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. The current presale price of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is highly attractive, and as the token continues to gain traction, early investors stand to benefit significantly from price appreciation. Community and Developer Support: Mpeppe (MPEPE) has already garnered a strong following, with a growing community of supporters and a dedicated development team. This support is crucial for the long-term success of any cryptocurrency, and Mpeppe’s early success in its presale phase is a testament to the confidence that investors have in the project. Ripple (XRP) Struggles Amid Market Uncertainty Despite its recent price increase, Ripple (XRP) still faces significant challenges. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and the factors driving XRP’s recent gains may not be sustainable in the long term. For example, while the reduction in whale-to-exchange transactions is a positive sign, it also indicates that large holders may be waiting for a better opportunity to sell, which could lead to a sudden drop in price if they decide to liquidate their holdings. Furthermore, while the increase in DEX volume suggests growing on-chain demand for Ripple (XRP), this alone may not be enough to push the price to the $1 mark. The broader market sentiment is still cautious, and any negative news or regulatory developments could quickly reverse the current trend. Conclusion: Mpeppe Offers a Better Risk-Reward Profile In light of the challenges facing Ripple (XRP), Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling alternative for investors seeking high potential returns. With its strategic focus on the gambling industry, attractive presale price, and strong community support, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing interest in niche cryptocurrencies. Investors interested in participating in the Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale can do so using the smart contract address 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B.

32626037,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636758,1724174374,An Ethereum Whale Has Joined The Memecoin World With Pepe Unchained and Mpeppe,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to dramatic shifts, with investors constantly seeking new opportunities to maximize their gains.

Pepe Unchained: A Beacon of Resilience in a Volatile Market Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has been making headlines for its impressive performance amidst a challenging market environment.

Projects like Dogwifhat and Brett saw their values drop by 21% and 19% respectively, while others like Pepe and Bonk also experienced downward pressure. Yet, amidst this turmoil, Pepe Unchained has continued to grow, recently achieving a price of $0.0009163 per token, an encouraging sign for both current and potential investors.

Mpeppe stands out for its strategic focus on the gambling sector, a market that is both large and rapidly expanding.

Market Influence: The whale’s entry into these tokens is likely to attract additional attention from other investors. As more people follow the whale’s lead, both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) could see increased buying pressure, further driving up their prices. What’s Next for Pepe Unchained and Mpeppe? As Pepe Unchained (PEPU) continues to close in on its $10 million fundraising goal, the excitement surrounding its upcoming launch is palpable. The project’s unique Layer-2 blockchain, which allows for faster and cheaper transactions, positions it well for long-term success. With nearly 15,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram, the community backing for Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is strong, and the token’s future looks bright. For Mpeppe, the ongoing presale is an opportunity for early investors to get in on the ground floor.

32625971,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636753,1724174365,Mpeppe (MPEPE) Presale Gains Traction as PEPU Holders Rush To Purchase MPEPE Tokens,"As the cryptocurrency market begins to stir from its summer slumber, savvy investors are on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Pepe Unchained (PEPU), with its innovative approach and strong presale performance, has already captured significant attention. However, as the market starts to show signs of life, many Pepe Unchained (PEPU) holders are now shifting their focus to another promising venture: Mpeppe (MPEPE). With its presale gaining momentum, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a must-have token, attracting a growing number of investors eager to secure their positions before the next price hike. The Rising Star: Pepe Unchained’s Path to Success Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has been making waves in the crypto community, positioning itself as a potential leader in the next bull run. Despite the broader market’s lackluster performance during the summer months, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has continued to build momentum, raising nearly $9.5 million in its ongoing ICO. This impressive figure is a testament to the confidence investors have in PEPU’s unique offering. What makes Pepe Unchained particularly compelling is its Layer-2 solution, which is built on its own blockchain. This technology allows for transactions that are 100 times faster and significantly cheaper than those conducted on Ethereum’s mainnet. The potential for PEPU to become the foundation of an entire ecosystem of meme coins is significant, and this has not gone unnoticed by early investors. Moreover, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) offers a staking pool with an exceptionally high annual percentage yield (APY) of 209%. This has further incentivized investors to stake their tokens, reducing the available supply and potentially driving up the price when PEPU hits the open market. With its combination of cutting-edge technology and attractive financial incentives, Pepe Unchained is well on its way to becoming a standout success in the meme coin space. The Shift to Mpeppe: Diversification for Maximum Gains While Pepe Unchained continues to attract interest, many of its investors are now turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a complementary investment. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) presale has already raised over $1,088,621, with more than 70.41% of the tokens sold. Priced at $0.001777 USDT, Mpeppe offers a unique opportunity for those looking to diversify their portfolios and maximize their potential gains. Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out not only for its presale success but also for its strategic positioning within the cryptocurrency market. As a gambling-focused meme coin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) taps into a niche sector that is both highly lucrative and growing rapidly. This focus on the gambling industry provides Mpeppe (MPEPE) with a clear use case, distinguishing it from other meme coins that rely purely on community-driven hype. Why PEPU Holders Are Flocking to Mpeppe Several key factors are driving PEPU holders to invest in Mpeppe: Early Entry Advantage: Like Pepe Unchained (PEPU), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its presale phase, offering early investors the chance to buy in at a low price before the token’s value increases. This early entry point is particularly appealing to those who missed out on the initial gains from Pepe Unchained (PEPU). Complementary Investment: By investing in both PEPU and Mpeppe, investors can diversify their portfolios across two promising meme coins, each with its own unique value proposition. This strategy allows for risk mitigation while increasing the potential for substantial returns. Growing Market Appeal: Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) focus on the gambling sector provides it with a clear use case that appeals to a broad range of investors. As the presale continues to gain traction, the token’s potential for significant growth becomes increasingly apparent. What’s Next for Mpeppe and PEPU Investors? As the presale for Mpeppe (MPEPE) progresses, investors who have already secured their positions in Pepe Unchained (PEPU) are strategically adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios. This dual investment strategy not only increases their exposure to the lucrative meme coin market but also positions them to benefit from the unique strengths of both tokens. With the next price increase for Mpeppe just around the corner, now is the time for PEPU holders to act. The current price of $0.001777 USDT is set to rise to $0.0021 USDT in the next stage, offering those who invest now the chance to lock in gains before the token’s value appreciates further. Key Considerations for Potential Investors For those looking to capitalize on the current momentum, here are a few key points to consider: Diversification: Investing in both PEPU and Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides a balanced approach to capturing the growth potential in the meme coin sector. Early Investment: Securing tokens during the presale phase allows investors to benefit from lower prices and greater potential for upside. Market Timing: As the broader crypto market begins to show signs of recovery, the strategic timing of these investments could result in significant returns. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Future Gains The growing interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) from Pepe Unchained (PEPU) holders is a clear indication of the token’s potential to deliver substantial returns. As Mpeppe’s presale continues to gain traction, it presents a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the strengths of both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE).

32625904,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636748,1724174358,Pepecoin Investors Love The Utility Of Rival Token Mpeppe Positioned to 340x,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where timing and strategic investments are crucial, Pepecoin (PEPE) has emerged as a significant player, captivating the attention of meme coin enthusiasts. As the market continues to mature, investors are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities that offer substantial returns and real-world utility. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rising star in the meme coin universe that has not only attracted the attention of Pepecoin (PEPE) holders but also positioned itself as a potential 340x investment. Here’s why Pepecoin (PEPE) investors are making the switch to Mpeppe (MPEPE). Pepecoin (PEPE): A Rollercoaster of Highs and Lows Pepecoin (PEPE) has been a prominent name in the meme coin market, known for its rapid price movements and the potential for high returns. As of today, Pepecoin (PEPE) is trading at $0.000008 with a market capitalization of $3.41 billion, reflecting a 12.51% increase in the last 24 hours. With a circulating supply of 420,689.90 billion tokens and a 24-hour trading volume of $714 million, Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to be a significant force in the market. However, Pepecoin (PEPE) has recently faced bearish pressure, leading to price consolidation near the support trendline of a bullish technical pattern known as the “falling wedge.” This pattern suggests that Pepecoin (PEPE) may be primed for an upward reversal, potentially triggering a short squeeze that could drive prices up by as much as 178%. While this setup is promising, the volatility and uncertainty surrounding Pepecoin (PEPE) have led some investors to seek alternative investments that offer both stability and potential for growth. The Rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Utility-Driven Meme Coin While Pepecoin (PEPE) has captured the market’s attention with its speculative potential, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a meme coin that offers more than just hype—it provides real utility. Currently priced at $0.001777 during its presale, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining traction among Pepecoin (PEPE) investors who are eager to diversify their portfolios with a token that has the potential to 340x. One of the key reasons for this shift is Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s strategic focus on combining the viral appeal of meme coins with practical applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on community-driven hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is building a comprehensive ecosystem that includes staking rewards, NFT marketplaces, and DeFi lending platforms. This multi-faceted approach not only enhances the token’s value proposition but also provides investors with tangible use cases that can drive sustained growth. Why Pepecoin (PEPE) Investors Are Embracing Mpeppe (MPEPE) There are several compelling reasons why Pepecoin (PEPE) investors are gravitating towards Mpeppe (MPEPE): Enhanced Utility: While Pepecoin (PEPE) has thrived on its meme culture and speculative potential, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers real utility through its integration into DeFi and NFT ecosystems. This utility-driven approach makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) more than just a speculative asset, providing a strong foundation for long-term growth. Potential for Exponential Gains: With Pepecoin (PEPE), investors have experienced both the highs and lows of the meme coin market. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioned as the next big opportunity, with the potential to deliver 340x returns. This level of growth is highly attractive to Pepecoin (PEPE) holders who are looking for the next big win in the meme coin space. Timing and Early Entry: Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its presale phase, offering investors an opportunity to get in early before the token’s price increases. For Pepecoin (PEPE) investors who may have missed the early gains in PEPE, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a chance to capture significant upside potential from the ground floor. The Future of Meme Coins: Utility Meets Speculation The success of Pepecoin (PEPE) has shown that meme coins can capture massive market attention and deliver substantial returns. However, the rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) indicates a new trend in the meme coin market—one where utility and real-world applications play a crucial role in driving value. By combining the viral nature of meme coins with tangible use cases, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is setting a new standard for what meme coins can achieve. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain momentum, it is likely to attract even more attention from Pepecoin (PEPE)investors and the broader crypto community. With its unique blend of utility and speculative potential, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is well-positioned to become a major player in the meme coin market, offering investors a chance to participate in a token that has both short-term and long-term growth prospects. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Savvy Investors For Pepecoin (PEPE) investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the next big opportunity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling proposition. With its current presale price of $0.001777 and the potential to 340x, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting attention from those who understand the importance of timing and utility in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. As the market continues to evolve, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out as a meme coin that is not only poised for explosive growth but also provides real value to its holders. For those who believe in the power of meme coins but are looking for more than just hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is the next logical step a token that combines the best of both worlds.

32626321,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636764,1724174341,XRP Whale Now Holds Mpeppe (MPEPE) Why The Move?,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, major investors commonly known as “whales” are constantly on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Recently, a notable XRP whale made headlines by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolio. This move has sparked curiosity and speculation within the crypto community. Why would a seasoned XRP investor, deeply entrenched in the Ripple (XRP) ecosystem, shift their focus to Mpeppe? Let’s dive into the reasons behind this strategic decision. Ripple (XRP) Continues Upward Momentum Ripple (XRP) has been experiencing a resurgence, with its price recently climbing back to $0.60, marking a 7.74% gain within 24 hours. This rally aligns with a broader market recovery, making XRP one of the top gainers among leading cryptocurrencies. Analysts are optimistic that XRP’s price could reach $0.65 if this uptrend persists. This positive outlook is supported by a significant drop in whale-to-exchange transactions, which have fallen tenfold since August 18. This decrease in large-scale transactions suggests that Ripple (XRP) whales are holding onto their assets, a bullish sign that could support further price increases. However, the world of cryptocurrency is notorious for its volatility. While Ripple’s (XRP) current trend is encouraging, it’s essential to acknowledge that the market can change rapidly. This uncertainty might be one reason why Ripple (XRP) whales are diversifying their portfolios, seeking out new opportunities that offer high growth potential—such as Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Contender in the Meme Coin Space Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly gaining attention as a promising new meme coin, particularly within the online gambling sector. Currently in its presale phase, Mpeppe is priced at $0.001777 USDT, and over 70% of the tokens have already been sold. The smart contract address for Mpeppe is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B, which allows interested investors to join the presale easily. But what makes Mpeppe stand out in a crowded meme coin market? For one, Mpeppe isn’t just about riding the meme coin wave it’s strategically positioned within the booming online gambling industry. This focus gives Mpeppe a clear use case, setting it apart from other meme coins that rely solely on community hype. The online gambling market is projected to reach over $100 billion by 2026, making Mpeppe an attractive investment for those looking to capitalize on this rapidly growing sector. Why the XRP Whale Diversified with Mpeppe So, why did an XRP whale decide to invest in Mpeppe? The reasons are multifaceted and strategic: Portfolio Diversification: While Ripple (XRP) remains a stronghold in the whale’s portfolio, the inherent volatility of the crypto market makes diversification a prudent strategy. By investing in Mpeppe, the whale is spreading risk and tapping into a different sector—online gambling—that offers significant growth potential. High Growth Potential: Mpeppe is in its early stages, and the presale has already shown strong investor interest. Early investments in successful projects can lead to exponential returns, a prospect that likely attracted the whale to Mpeppe. Market Sentiment: The current sentiment around Ripple (XRP) is cautiously optimistic. While the price could reach $0.65, there’s also the risk of a downturn if market demand falters. By investing in Mpeppe, the whale is hedging against potential XRP volatility while positioning themselves for high returns in a different market segment. The Future of Ripple (XRP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) As Ripple (XRP) continues its upward trend, bolstered by a reduction in whale-to-exchange transactions and increased on-chain demand, it remains a formidable player in the crypto space. However, the market’s unpredictability makes it essential for investors to explore new opportunities. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its strategic focus on the online gambling industry, offers a fresh and potentially lucrative avenue for investment. The decision by an Ripple (XRP) whale to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the importance of diversification in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency. While Ripple (XRP) may continue to perform well, Mpeppe presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on a burgeoning market. For investors, holding both Ripple (XRP) and Mpeppe could be a wise strategy to maximize returns while navigating the complexities of the crypto market. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Future Gains In conclusion, the move by an XRP whale to acquire Mpeppe (MPEPE) reflects a calculated strategy to diversify and secure future gains. Ripple (XRP) continues to show promise, but the potential of Mpeppe in the online gambling market provides an additional layer of opportunity. As the crypto market evolves, the combination of XRP’s established presence and Mpeppe’s growth potential could prove to be a winning formula for forward-thinking investors.

This follows a massive surge in DOGE’s stock-to-flow ratio, which is expected to impact its price positively. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Headed For A 40% Slide? This Analyst Thinks So How Supply Squeeze Could Lead To Price Surge For Dogecoin Data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment shows that Dogecoin faces a supply squeeze, with the meme coin’s stock-to-flow ratio rising. Between August 18 and 19, this stock-to-flow ratio surged to an all-time high (ATH) of 69.25. This metric measures a commodity’s scarcity and indicates a massive demand for Dogecoin. This development could lead to a supply squeeze for Dogecoin as the demand for the meme coin continues to outpace its supply. Such a supply squeeze ultimately drives up prices, meaning that a significant price rally is currently on the cards for Dogecoin. Other on-chain metrics confirm that demand for Dogecoin is rising and that a price surge could happen anytime soon. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin’s large transactions have surged these past few days and hit a 7-day high of 7.37 billion DOGE on August 19. This indicates increased whale activity and suggests that these investors are heavily accumulating Dogecoin ahead of its next leg up, which looks imminent. Furthermore, this shift to accumulation among Dogecoin whales is also evident in the large holders’ netflow, which has spiked by over 3,200% in the last seven days. During this period, this category of investors has recorded more inflows than outflows, indicating that they are adding to their positions and moving them off exchanges. This massive demand for DOGE isn’t only among the whales, as the meme coin’s trading volume over the last 24 hours suggests that retail investors are also accumulating the foremost meme coin. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Dogecoin’s transaction volume has surged by over 51%, with $625.3 million traded during this period. What To Expect From Dogecoin’s Price Crypto analyst Javon Marks has provided insights into how high Dogecoin could rise on its next leg up. The analyst remarked that the meme coin could enjoy a 513% rally to reach the $0.6533 price target. Interestingly, the analyst added that this price surge could happen at “high speeds,” indicating that it could happen faster than some might imagine. This bullish prediction followed his analysis of Dogecoin’s relative strength index (RSI), which he noted is nearing a breakout point and diverging with prices. With such bullish signals and prices still broken, Marks is confident that a “major bull move” is underway, which would send Dogecoin to this price target.

32629512,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636660,1724167841,XRP Spikes 6%: Can It Overcome $0.66 For Further Upside?,"XRP has captured market attention with a 6% surge, raising speculation about potential gains should it break through the key $0.60 resistance level. As the cryptocurrency climbs closer to this crucial resistance level, traders are eager to see if it can maintain its upward momentum and surpass this barrier or encounter another pullback at this critical juncture. This article analyzes XRP’s recent rally, examines the technical and market indicators, and assesses the likelihood of a sustained breakout. It will provide readers with insights into the altcoin’s current market dynamics, the significance of the $0.60 resistance level, and the potential scenarios that could unfold if XRP successfully surpasses this critical threshold. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has risen by 7.01%, bringing its price to around $0.6056. The token’s market capitalization has exceeded $33 billion, while its trading volume has surpassed $1.6 billion. During this period, the market cap and trading volume have grown by 7.10% and 132.52%, respectively. XRP Performance: A Closer Look At The 6% Spike XRP’s price exhibits active bullish behavior, trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the 4-hour timeframe. This sustained price action above this key indicator suggests that bullish momentum is firmly in control. As a result, the upward trend could likely extend further, especially if the price continues to hold above the $0.57 critical resistance level. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that XRP could continue its surge toward the $0.66 resistance level. The signal line has risen above 50% and is trending around 69%, suggesting that bullish pressure remains strong in the market. On the 1-day, XRP’s price is actively bullish, trading above the 100-day SMA after a successful break above the $0.57 resistance level. It can be observed that the crypto asset is attempting a bullish move toward the $0.66 resistance level. With this recent move, the bulls could maintain control and drive higher prices. Lastly, the formation of the 1-day RSI suggests that XRP has a good chance of extending its bullish move. The signal line is trending at around 58% after failing to break below 50%, suggesting an additional upside for the cryptocurrency. Conclusion: XRP’s Path Forward—Can The Rally Sustain? If XRP maintains its current positive sentiment, it could reach the $0.66 resistance level. A breach of this level could further amplify market sentiment, potentially driving the price higher to the next critical resistance range at $0.73. Should the upward pressure persist, it could lead to an additional surge beyond this level. However, if the digital asset encounters resistance at $0.66 and fails to break above, it could trigger a potential downside move, reaching the $0.57 support mark. More losses could occur when the price drops below this level, targeting the $0.52 support mark and beyond.

The West African nation also plans to introduce a bill by September enabling it to tax crypto.

The SEC wants to issue its first licenses for digital service and tokenized assets as early as this month, Director-General Emomotimi Agama told Bloomberg.  The Abuja-based regulator is responding to the surge in demand for crypto, Agama said. ""The market size is huge and it is growing,” Agama said.  Nigeria is following nations across the world who have decided to license crypto companies. South Africa, the largest economy on the continent, recently started a crypto licensing regime. France introduced a new regime earlier this month, and the U.K. has been registering companies under its anti-money laundering rules since 2020 while it waits for more specific rules.  Nigeria also plans to introduce a bill by September that would enable it to tax crypto. In the meantime, the country is suing crypto exchange Binance for tax evasion and money laundering and is holding one of its executives in prison on money laundering charges.

32626181,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636661,1724162411,"Shiba Inu Secures Community Support To Rally To $1, Here’s How","The possibility of Shiba Inu rising to $1 is one crypto community members look to support. This follows a recent poll by the crypto exchange CoinW, which showed that others besides the SHIB community believe such a price target may be attainable. Related Reading: Ethereum Transaction Costs Hit Historic Lows: What Does This Mean For ETH? Shiba Inu Rising To $1 Gains Community Support In an X (formerly Twitter) post, CoinW made a poll asking community members which prediction for the top-ranked crypto tokens is likely to happen first. This included the prediction of Shiba Inu rising to $1, which showed that the meme coin eventually rising to this price level has been considered and supported by notable figures in the crypto community. Shiba Inu rallying to $1 will undoubtedly be massive, representing over a 7 million percent price gain for the meme coin. However, such a price gain isn’t new to Shiba Inu, considering that it recorded an unprecedented price gain of 150 million percent in the 2021 bull run. However, it remains uncertain whether or not reaching this price level can happen in this market cycle. Based on the most bullish predictions given for SHIB, the rally to $1 will unlikely happen in this bull run. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who has offered the most bullish price prediction for Shiba Inu, stated that the meme coin could rise to as high as $0.011 in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja has predicted that Shiba Inu will rise to $0.001 in this bull run. While there is a consensus that Shiba Inu can eventually reach $1, some crypto analysts, like Oscar Ramos, have reservations about this happening. This came following his statement that Shiba Inu can’t even reach $0.01 in this cycle due to its current supply of over 580 trillion. Shiba Inu’s burn tracker previously noted that the meme coin will need to have a circulating supply of just over 85 billion to reach $0.01, meaning that Shiba Inu’s supply will still need to be much less if it is to reach $1 eventually. Shiba Inu’s Next Move While the crypto community contemplates when Shiba Inu’s rise to $1 will happen, crypto analyst Javon Marks has provided insights into the meme coin’s next move. Marks has predicted that the meme coin could enjoy a price rally to $0.000081, with Shiba Inu already holding a larger breakout. A rise to this price level represents an almost 500% price gain for the meme coin from its current price. However, Marks is confident that SHIB can make such a run, noting how certain bullish signals on the chart point to a bullish breakout for the meme coin.

42390579,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd3nxT,1724158800,Dark Pools Dominate Ethereum as Private Transactions Surge – at Least by One Measure,"A growing number of sophisticated Ethereum users are choosing to transact privately on the blockchain – relying on so-called dark pools to avoid trading bots set up to front-run transactions, but potentially obscuring the openness and transparency that are supposed to be hallmarks of decentralized public networks.  That's according to new research compiled by Blocknative, a company that specializes in preventing or minimizing the impact of MEV, which stands for ""maximal extractable value"" – the profits that can be siphoned off by fast-moving software bots that can quickly enter into trades to skim margin off of transactions that are sitting in the network's public queue, waiting to be processed.  Private transactions, which are sent directly to validators or block proposers, instead of public mempools, now account for about half of the total on Ethereum, in terms of the total gas usage – reflecting the computational power required to process transactions. The percentage was about 7% in September 2022 when Ethereum transitioned into a proof-of-stake network, but it's taken off this year, jumping from about 15% since the start of 2024.  A consequence of the trend is that ""private transaction order flow is only accessible to permission network participants,"" which can be a centralizing force if a smaller number of sophisticated players reap more of the rewards, Blocknative wrote in a blog post discussing the findings.  ""You have a small number of actors who can see the private flow,"" Blocknative CEO Matt Cutler said in an interview. ""Certain people can see stuff, and certain people can't, and that creates opportunity and advantage.""  The data might look off to pros who have observed such statistics before. The more typical way of measuring the prevalence of private activity is with transaction count, and that's currently around 30%. As recently as 2022, that share was closer to 4.5%.  But private transactions tend to be more complex, and thus more ""gas intensive,"" according to Blocknative.  ""By shifting focus to the amount of gas used by private transactions, we gain a more accurate understanding of network dynamics,"" Blocknative wrote in the post.  Among the disadvantages for users transacting publicly is that fee rates, which fluctuate based on network demand, can be more volatile, and highly unpredictable, Cutler said.  ""Only certain actors like the block builders can see what's going on in the network,"" Cutler said. They have ""exclusive access to certain information. That gives you an edge. It's a big fact of life.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/08/20/dark-pools-dominate-ethereum-as-private-transactions-surge-at-least-by-one-measure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1bcc9d2c24a22f71a0680754e1509c90771b7532-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Supporting this probability is Mobilum’s recent tweet that placed the spotlight on Tron’s robust network as it supported transactions worldwide. Tron Users Contribute Massively On Mobilum Crypto banking platform Mobilum released some statistics featuring Tron users using the platform for real world transactions. According to the X post, Tron users contributed massively to Mobilum’s operations worldwide. Global reach, local ease with @trondao 🌍 In August 2024, #TRON users made transactions in the Mobilum ecosystem worldwide: • Asia: 39% • North America: 25.5% • Europe: 20.5% • South America: 5% • Africa: 5% • Australia: 5% Proud to power seamless crypto payments across… pic.twitter.com/IpyiScqmks — Mobilum (@mobilumofficial) August 19, 2024 The biggest figure came from Asia with over 39% of transactions attributed to Tron users followed by the United States and Europe. This signals a huge turning point for Tron as it continues to find itself in real-world use cases. Tron Hits New Annual Transactions High Tron’s network has also continued to flex its muscles as Into The Block recently posted how it hit almost 8 million transactions per day, with an average of 7 million transactions per day. This high throughput on the platform helped TRX’s growth in the long term. With over 7 million daily transactions, the #TRON network is becoming a vital part of everyday life for millions around the world. 🌎 https://t.co/Br1DLllzae — TRON DAO (@trondao) August 19, 2024 The platform’s focus on stablecoins is one of the factors that contribute to its growth. As of writing, there are four stablecoins used on Tron namely USDT, USDJ, TUSD, and USDC. Ceiling Hit But Not Broken By TRX The token’s current trajectory might be upward, but it seems the next couple of days might be tough for investors and traders. At its best, TRX might retract to more sustainable levels with a possible rebound right after. As of writing, breaking through the current ceiling of $0.1472 is too big of a hurdle for TRX bulls in the short term. Given some time, however, we might see the token gain enough momentum to have a breakthrough on this level. TRX is overpriced after nearly a couple of days’ worth of bullish momentum pushing gains to investor portfolios. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Skyrocketing Potential: Could SHIB Surge 500%? With the relative strength index (RSI) being at its peak, this signals a possible loss in momentum will occur in the coming days, pushing the token back to $0.14. If this happens, $0.14 will give way to the bears, pushing the token to $0.13. However, $0.13 is the lowest the token will go. TRX’s low correlation with Bitcoin will gradually pick up as the days go by, helping TRX retake lost ground once the friction of the bullrun wears out. For now, holding the token might be the best decision for investors and traders as they continue to monitor the broader market for swings in price.

Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $61 million in net inflows, the highest since $192 million on Aug. 8, data from SoSoValue shows. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $92 million of inflows, while Bitwise’s BITB recorded $25 million of outflows. Japan’s Metaplanet said it completed a BTC purchase worth $3.4 million, bringing its total holdings to 360.368 BTC. At the time of writing, bitcoin is priced just below $60,800, an increase of 4.6% in the last 24 hours, outperforming the broader crypto market, which has risen 4%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index.  Traders speculating on how the U.S. election might affect the digital assets industry have locked up millions in bitcoin options tied to the event. The election expiry options began trading on Deribit a month ago. The notional open interest, or the dollar value, of the number of active options contracts was $345.83 million, according to Amberdata. Call options, which offer an unlimited upside payoff potential at the expense of limited loss, accounted for 67% of the total open interest. The rest came from put options, amounting to a put-call ratio of less than 0.50. In other words, twice as many calls were open as puts, reflecting bullish expectations from the outcome of the elections.  State Street is partnering with digital asset custodian Taurus for its tokenization plans with the intention of extending to crypto custody once the U.S. regulatory environment improves. State Street, which has $44.3 trillion in assets under management, plans to go live with tokenized versions of traditional assets. The bank has been “very vocal” about the need to change SAB 121, which could force banks seeking to hold crypto to maintain an onerous amount of capital to compensate for the risk, Donna Milrod, chief product officer and head of Digital Asset Solutions, said in an interview. “While we're starting with tokenization, that's not where we're ending. As soon as the U.S. regulations help us out, we will be providing digital custody services as well.""  Chart of the Day  The chart shows open interest-weighted funding rates in bitcoin.  Funding rates flipped negative over the weekend, signaling a bias against holding long bets or bullish positions in the perpetual futures market.  BTC, however, has crossed above $60,000 in the past 24 hours. The positive price action may see shorts throw in the towel, adding to the bullish momentum.

32620739,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636618,1724151636,XRP Price Chart Signals Major Breakout: Top 5 Reasons To Watch,"XRP is one of the top performers within the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in the past 24 hours. With a price increase of 7%, the XRP price is showing significant bullish momentum, which could continue to expand according to various crypto analysts. Dark Defender (@DefendDark) released a new technical analysis of the XRP/USD pair today that shows a strong bullish trend. According to his latest post on X, “XRP touched the fibonacci zone of 61.80% at $0.6044 & trying to break here. Heikin Ashi candles are bullish & Green. RSI has golden cross & Green. Ichimoku Clouds are Green. Shortly we expect to touch $0.6649 then $0.9327!” This statement is loaded with technical insights and predictions. #1 XRP About To Break Key Fibonacci Levels Starting with the Fibonacci retracement levels, a popular tool among traders for identifying potential reversal levels, the price of XRP touching and attempting to breach the 61.80% retracement level at $0.6044 is significant. This level often acts as a major resistance or support level, depending on the direction of the approach. Related Reading: Monday’s Crypto Leaderboard: BNB And XRP Surge Past Market Leaders For XRP, this level is crucial as the price has rebounded from recent lows and is testing this crucial threshold that could confirm the continuation of the upward trend. If XRP closes above $0.6044 on the daily chart, $0.6649 (70.20%) and then $0.9327 (100%) could be next targets, according to Dark Defender. #2 Bullish Heikin Ashi Candles The mention of “Heikin Ashi candles are bullish & Green” indicates that the recent price action has been dominantly bullish, characterized by green Heikin Ashi candlesticks. These candlesticks differ from traditional ones as they are derived from average price movements, thus they help traders identify trends more clearly and make decisions based on less noisy data. #3 RSI Golden Cross Another important aspect Dark Defender highlights is the “RSI has golden cross & Green.” The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale of zero to 100. Typically, an RSI reading above 70 indicates a market in overbought conditions, while below 30 suggests oversold conditions. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Spike To $26 In This Bull Run As Base Case The RSI line has crossed above its moving average, creating what is known as a ‘golden cross.’ This is typically a bullish signal, suggesting that the momentum is shifting towards the buying side. The RSI is currently trending upwards, staying within the neutral territory, indicating there is room for upward movement before the asset becomes technically ‘overbought.’ #4 XRP Trades Above The Ichimoku Cloud Furthermore, the analyst points to the fact that the “Ichimoku Clouds are Green.” This is another popular technical analysis tool that provides insights into the future price action. A green cloud typically indicates a bullish future price movement and acts as a support area for the price. This aligns with the other indicators suggesting a strong bullish momentum. #5 Chaikin Money Flow Makes New High The fifth bullish reason comes from NewsBTCs head of research Tony “The Bull” Severino. Via X, he remarked: “XRP monthly Chaikin Money Flow looks promising with a higher high.” The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator plays a crucial role in underscoring the bullish sentiment. The recent observation by Severino that the CMF has formed a higher high indicates a significant increase in buying pressure. The CMF, by measuring the volume-weighted accumulation of trades over the past month, shows that more traders are buying XRP near the closing prices of its trading sessions, a pattern generally associated with increasing market confidence. The move of the CMF into positive territory is a shift that suggests a strong inflow of money into XRP, contrasting with periods when the CMF lingered around or below zero, reflecting a balance or dominance of selling pressure. At press time, XRP traded at $0.6070.

32621306,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24033,1724151250,Bitfinex Alpha 118 | Vì Sao ETH Lại Hụt Hơi?,"tải toàn bộ report Đăng ký đọc Bitfinex Alpha Các ETF Ethereum vẫn đang chật vật so với ETF Bitcoin, với dòng tiền chảy ra đáng kể góp phần vào việc Ether “đuối sức” hơn Bitcoin. Mặc dù có một số dòng tiền vào các ETF Ethereum mới hơn như iShares Ethereum Trust của BlackRock, nhưng các sản phẩm cũ hơn như Ethereum Trust (ETHE) của Grayscale lại đối mặt với dòng tiền chảy ra đáng kể, càng trầm trọng hơn bởi việc bán mạnh từ các nhà tạo lập thị trường lớn như Jump Trading. Điều này đã dẫn đến việc giá Ether giảm 40% tính đến đầu tháng 8, với tỷ lệ ETH/BTC chạm mức thấp nhất trong hơn 1.200 ngày. Ngược lại, các ETF Bitcoin lại cho thấy khả năng phục hồi , với dòng tiền vào ổn định và hiệu suất giá ổn định hơn. Sự tin tưởng của thị trường vào Bitcoin vẫn mạnh mẽ, bất chấp những thách thức như nguồn cung dư thừa. Bitcoin vẫn đang đi đúng hướng để theo quỹ đạo tăng trưởng sau halving trước đó và chúng tôi dự đoán một quý 4 cực kỳ tăng giá . Dựa trên dữ liệu lịch sử, có thể đáy quý 3 đã xuất hiện hoặc chúng ta còn một nhịp giảm cuối cùng để tìm đáy cho Bitcoin. Khi các ETF Ethereum vật lộn với hiệu suất hỗn hợp và dòng tiền chảy ra cao, những tháng tới sẽ rất quan trọng trong việc xác định khả năng phục hồi và thu hút sự quan tâm đầu tư bền vững của chúng. Các yếu tố chính như môi trường kinh tế vĩ mô rộng lớn hơn và khả năng cắt giảm lãi suất của Cục Dự trữ Liên bang sẽ ảnh hưởng đáng kể đến dòng chảy ETF trong tương lai và động lực thị trường đối với cả Ethereum và Bitcoin. Dữ liệu kinh tế vĩ mô từ tuần trước cho thấy vào tháng 7, bối cảnh kinh tế Mỹ cho thấy dấu hiệu lạm phát đang hạ nhiệt, khi giá tiêu dùng tăng với tốc độ chậm lại hơn, cho thấy áp lực lạm phát đang dần giảm bớt . Lần đầu tiên sau gần ba năm rưỡi, tỷ lệ lạm phát hàng năm giảm xuống dưới 3%, làm tăng kỳ vọng rằng Cục Dự trữ Liên bang có thể xem xét giảm lãi suất trong tương lai gần. Bổ sung cho xu hướng này, Chỉ số giá sản xuất (PPI) cho tháng 7 chỉ tăng 0,1%, giảm so với mức 0,2% trong tháng 6, cho thấy chi phí sản xuất thấp hơn đang góp phần vào việc hạ nhiệt lạm phát nói chung. Bất chấp những diễn biến tích cực này, doanh số bán lẻ của Mỹ đã tăng vọt vào tháng 7, đánh dấu mức tăng nhanh nhất kể từ đầu năm 2023. Điều này phản ánh khả năng phục hồi của chi tiêu tiêu dùng, vốn vẫn mạnh mẽ ngay cả khi đối mặt với những thách thức dai dẳng như giá cả và chi phí đi vay cao. Tuy nhiên, không phải tất cả các lĩnh vực của nền kinh tế đều hoạt động tốt. Thị trường nhà ở Mỹ tiếp tục gặp khó khăn , với việc xây dựng nhà ở cho một gia đình giảm xuống mức thấp nhất trong 16 tháng vào tháng 7. Sự sụt giảm này có thể là do các yếu tố như tác động của cơn bão Beryl, sự gia tăng nguồn cung nhà mới và gánh nặng của lãi suất thế chấp cao và giá bất động sản tăng. Bất chấp những thất bại này, tâm lý người tiêu dùng đã có dấu hiệu cải thiện , với Khảo sát Người tiêu dùng của Đại học Michigan ghi nhận mức tăng đầu tiên sau 5 tháng. Sự gia tăng niềm tin này phần lớn được thúc đẩy bởi những kỳ vọng lạc quan hơn về tương lai, ngay cả khi những lo ngại về tình trạng hiện tại của nền kinh tế vẫn còn tồn tại. Trong tin tức về tiền điện tử tuần trước, chính phủ Hoa Kỳ đã chuyển 10.000 BTC bị tịch thu , trị giá khoảng 600 triệu đô la, từ vụ án Silk Road sang Coinbase Prime, có thể cho mục đích lưu ký. Động thái này phù hợp với quan hệ đối tác của Bộ Tư pháp với Coinbase Prime để quản lý tài sản kỹ thuật số lớn. Các ví của chính phủ Hoa Kỳ hiện nắm giữ khoảng 12 tỷ đô la Bitcoin. Về mặt doanh nghiệp, Tether đã tận dụng lợi nhuận ngày càng tăng của mình để thách thức những gã khổng lồ công nghệ bằng cách đầu tư vào AI và các công ty khởi nghiệp công nghệ thông qua công ty liên doanh mới của mình, Tether Evo . Với 118,5 tỷ đô la Tether token dự trữ, lợi nhuận của Tether đã tăng vọt, cho phép công ty đa dạng hóa ngoài stablecoin USDt của mình, sang các lĩnh vực tiên tiến như công nghệ cấy ghép thần kinh và cơ sở hạ tầng AI. Trong khi đó, tại UAE, một quyết định mang tính bước ngoặt của Tòa án sơ thẩm Dubai đã công nhận thanh toán bằng tiền điện tử cho tiền lương theo hợp đồng lao động. Phán quyết này đại diện cho một sự thay đổi đáng kể trong lập trường pháp lý của UAE về tiền tệ kỹ thuật số và tiếp tục hỗ trợ tham vọng của Dubai trong việc củng cố vị thế của mình như một trung tâm tiền điện tử toàn cầu.

42390584,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd3oN7,1724150185,"U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Continue to Fall, No Longer Signal Recession","The Conference Board's leading indicators no longer signal recession.  The U.S. recession fears were partly responsible for the early August slide in stocks and cryptocurrencies.  The leading U.S. economic indicators are still pointing to a slowdown, but no longer signal a recession, data from the Conference Board, a nonpartisan and non-profit research organization, showed Tuesday. That's a positive sign for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The organization's Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) declined 0.6% in July to 100.4 following June's 0.2% drop. The measure peaked in the second quarter of 2022 and has been falling ever since, according to data source MacroMicro.  The LEI comprises several forward-looking indicators such as average weekly hours in manufacturing, average weekly initial claims for jobless insurance, ISM new orders index, stock prices and leading credit index. It helps identify shifts in economic trends and turning points in financial markets and is considered one of the most reliable signals of a recession – defined as consecutive quarterly contractions in the growth rate.  The continued decline in the LEI indicates impending headwinds for the economy. However, the annualized six-month change narrowed to -2.1% in July from -3.1% in June, a sign the risk of recession is lessening.  “The LEI continues to fall on a month-over-month basis, but the six-month annual growth rate no longer signals recession ahead,” Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, senior manager of business cycle indicators at the board, said in a statement.  The latest reading is likely reassuring to risk asset bulls. Perhaps the pain trade in stocks and cryptocurrencies is now on the higher side, given the backdrop of the recent market slide and the resulting dour sentiment.  Recession fears gripped the market early this month after U.S. nonfarm payrolls data revealed a sharp slowdown in job creation in July. The Treasury yield curve witnessed bull steepening to signal recession alongside a similar warning by the so-called Sahm's Rule. The mass unwinding of yen carry trades added fuel to the fire.  As a result, stocks dropped hard and bitcoin tumbled to $50,000 from $70,000. Since then, the leading cryptocurrency has climbed back to over $60,000, CoinDesk data show.  The chart shows that while the Conference Board's leading index is trending south, the coincident indicators, which indicate the economy's current state, are rising along with the lagging indicators.

42390573,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd3nSh,1724149800,"State Street Selects Taurus for Crypto Custody, Tokenization","Due to U.S. regulatory hurdles, State Street will initially focus on tokenization rather than crypto custody, with the first tokenization client to be named soon after going live.  State Street has been “very vocal” about the need to change the SEC's SAB 121, which could force banks seeking to hold crypto to maintain an onerous amount of capital to compensate for the risk.  State Street, the global custody bank with $44.3 trillion in assets under its watch, chose cryptocurrency custody and tokenization specialist Taurus to provide digital assets services in anticipation of a more congenial regulatory climate in the U.S.  The bank's initial focus is to go live with tokenized versions of traditional assets, with the first client named shortly afterward, State Street said.  A natural role for a custody specialist like State Street would be to look after digital assets, but banks in the U.S. have been faced with a major hurdle in the form of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which imposes restrictions on companies that want to hold their customer's crypto assets.  State Street has been “very vocal” about the need to change SAB 121, which could force banks seeking to hold crypto to maintain an onerous amount of capital to compensate for the risk, said Donna Milrod, State Street’s chief product officer and head of Digital Asset Solutions.  “While we're starting with tokenization, that's not where we're ending,” Milrod said in an interview. “As soon as the U.S. regulations help us out, we will be providing digital custody services as well. We know how to be a custodian. We don't do that on our balance sheet. We do that off-balance sheet. They're not our assets.”  Lamine Brahimi, co-founder and managing partner of Switzerland-based Taurus, pointed to the benefits of tokenization, such as 24/7 trading and the ability to optimize collateral management, while echoing the need for a better regulatory climate in the U.S.  “I'm quite sure this partnership with State Street will be a positive signal for the U.S. financial markets in general, which, because of SAB 121, have been lagging those in Europe,” Brahimi said in an interview.  State Street has a long history in blockchain technology and digital assets, most recently working with crypto custody firm Copper before the startup pivoted away from custody to focus on its ClearLoop settlement system.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/20/state-street-selects-taurus-for-crypto-custody-tokenization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c858c0bc20cb3b45571d51b93c2291f63a68d83-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bernstein said it sees the large publicly traded U.S. bitcoin miners as consolidators in the sector.  Leading miners should focus on growing market share and increasing their hashrates, the report said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} miners listed in the U.S. have a large advantage over their unlisted peers because their easier access to funding offers them more financial options than privately held firms or those that trade elsewhere, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday.  ""Being able to raise debt/equity in the world's deepest capital markets, presents a natural advantage versus non-U.S. miners, particularly in a capital intensive industry, poised for market consolidation,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  Last week's fundraising showcases the argument. Marathon Digital (MARA) said it planned a private placement of convertibles to buy bitcoin as a treasury asset. Riot Platforms (RIOT) announced a $750 million equity offering. Core Scientific (CORZ) and Bitdeer (BTDR) also announced that they planned to issue convertible debt.  Bernstein said this supports its long bias towards publicly listed U.S. bitcoin miners being consolidators in the sector.  The broker noted that the mining industry is split between companies focused on bitcoin mining and those pivoting to artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. Both are viable opportunities, the report said, and the common theme is consolidation because scale matters.  Still, ""bitcoin mining and AI data centers, while adjacent due to power capacity and high density power specs, are completely different businesses,"" the report noted.  The leading miners should remain focused on bitcoin mining market share and growing their hashrates, Bernstein said, and not selling the crypto they have mined at a loss.  Bernstein reiterated its view that BTC will hit new highs of around $200,000 in 2025 on the back of increased institutional adoption and the uptake of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the report added.

32618353,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636610,1724146228,Grayscale Exec Predicts Bitcoin Surge No Matter Who Wins US Election,"Zach Pandl, Grayscale Investments’ managing director, has boldly predicted that the price of Bitcoin will surge regardless of who wins in the upcoming US presidential election. He said this potential increase is because of macroeconomic trends, most especially pertaining to the assumed depreciation of the US dollar. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Nears Key Level As Analyst Eyes Over 100% Upside – Details According to Pandl, the fact that Bitcoin has a supply capped makes it an excellent hedge against inflation and monetary debasement as the US government continues to sustain more debt, now approaching a staggering $33.2 trillion. He expects the dollar to depreciate over the next 10 to 20 years, suggesting this could result in increased investment in BTC as a safe asset. Factors Driving Bitcoin’s Potential Surge One of the major reasons that might fuel a surge in the price of Bitcoin could be its limited supply. It has a restricted supply of 21 million coins in circulation, unlike central bank-issued, unlimited-supply fiat money. It is this very scarcity that makes it an especially ideal means of investment for people hedging against inflation and depreciation of currencies. Grayscale bets Bitcoin price will hit new records — at the expense of the US economyhttps://t.co/0HG3CPzo9O — DL News (@DLNewsInfo) August 19, 2024 Randl pointed out that the rise of Bitcoin to a trillion-dollar market capitalization actually occurred when the dollar was strong, so it should do much better in a depreciating dollar environment. The event could pull more and more investors into Bitcoin, thus continuing to raise its price. Skepticism Remains Despite Optimistic Outlook Though Pandl is optimistic, the financial community still has its dose of skepticism as to whether Bitcoin can indeed play a role in your portfolio as a store of value. Many analysts have cast doubt on whether runaway inflation can be expected or even if Bitcoin might stand equivalent to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. This continues to underline the intriguing status of Bitcoin among all cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Skyrocketing Potential: Could SHIB Surge 500%? The key thing here is that investments in Bitcoin face too many risks, and investors should be wary of these risks before they make any investment decision. Cryptocurrencies are known to be very volatile, meaning that their prices fluctuate based on several factors. Cautious Optimism For Bitcoin In the wake of the US election, the Grayscale executive has made a strong case for the surging value of Bitcoin regardless of the outcome of the US election. Of course, as far as investment consideration is concerned, an investor should be extremely careful about his or her risk tolerance. With debate about whether Bitcoin can be classified as a store of value never far away, it’s anyone’s conjecture if Pandl’s predictions come true.

The Ease-of-Movement indicator for Coinbase and other Big Tech stocks is showing a bearish reversal, signaling the potential for significant price declines the rest of 2024. With a stretched boom valuation, COIN is quite susceptible to the switch in supply/demand dynamics, as buying interest wanes. I have suggested Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) as a Strong Sell several times over the previous nine months, with my latest article posted in March here . Not only has the cryptocurrency world been in a downturn since the spring, but technically speaking, selling volumes in Coinbase have started to overwhelm buying interest over the past month. Seeking Alpha - Paul Franke, Coinbase Global Sell Article, March 13th, 2024 Believe it or not, Coinbase is yet another stock witnessing a big dump in the 14-day Ease of Movement indicator. I have talked about similar bearish reversals in momentum at other names since the spring, including Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) here , Meta Platforms ( META ) here , NVIDIA ( NVDA ) here , Microsoft ( MSFT ) here , Amazon ( AMZN ) here , Apple ( AAPL ) here , and Tesla ( TSLA ) here . It is honestly a little scary for the market's current condition, with many trading patterns looking like kissing cousins of the late 2021 to January 2022 top trades in Big Tech, before the -30% stumble in NASDAQ 100 equities into the first week of 2023. Effectively, huge drops to 52-week lows or even all-time lows in the EMV calculation can pinpoint a vacuum of buyers, in terms of supply/demand dynamics. The tell from this momentum indicator is very minor sell volumes are able to create outsized price declines for the stock. So, what happens if the absence of buying continues, while sell volumes pick up? Price is forced to decline to find supply for transactions. My view is the wicked reversals and deeply red readings for the EMV are screaming at smart investors to sell and/or avoid buying the Big Tech names, including crypto-related businesses until lower quotes appear. For Coinbase specifically, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) have been outlining very ugly charts since April. If a monster selloff in cryptos is next, Coinbase's position as a leading exchange will come under greater scrutiny as sales and profits move backwards. Sitting in a position of clear overvaluation at a major market peak will also not play out well for shareholders. Weakening Charts The focus of this story is tracking movements in the 14-day Ease of Movement creation, especially large negative numbers. In early August, COIN's EMV number hit a 52-week low (and its worst overall reading since December 2021). Below I have circled in gold this occurrence and the previous EMV 52-week low reached during the middle of April (also circled in gold). This bearish setup is in addition to other momentum indicators turning over or moving into sell territory since March. For example, the On Balance Volume indicator peaked in early March, and the 20-day Chaikin Money Flow reading has been red for three weeks running. StockCharts.com - Coinbase Global, 12 Months of Daily Price & Volume Changes, Author Reference Points In terms of crypto chart zigzags, Bitcoin's chart appears to be primed for a drop below US$50,000 in coming months. The equivalent EMV momentum setup is equally (if not more) bearish than Coinbase's pattern. Bitcoin has hit four new 52-week lows in the standard Ease of Movement calculation since March (circled in gold again). Plus, the reversal from a new EMV 52-week high to low in July-August is quite worrisome. On top of this situation, Bitcoin's price is staying below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. If you are bullish on Bitcoin, you have to be praying for a rally over $65,000 into September to right the ship. StockCharts.com - US$ Bitcoin, 12 Months of Daily Price & Volume Changes, Author Reference Points The last gigantic drop in the EMV indicator for Coinbase was during December 2021 (circled in gold below). The EMV sharply reversed from an all-time high in November to a record low four weeks later. This action can be very bearish in a bubble stock or one that has experienced a sizable runup beforehand. You can review how COIN was hit by high-volume selling during 2022, with price falling another -85% into December of that year from the EMV sell signal 12 months prior. StockCharts.com - Coinbase Global, Daily Price & Volume, April 2021 to Dec 2023, Author Reference Points Final Thoughts Current Wall Street analyst forecasts are calling for flat to rising cryptos with only minor improvement in Coinbase operating results in future years. For sure if the tide turns bearish for cryptocurrencies, COIN selling for 40x peak earnings (mostly generated by the rise in company-held cryptos) and 9x sales is not for conservative accounts or the faint of heart. Seeking Alpha Table - Coinbase Global, Analyst Estimates for 2024-26, Made August 16th, 2024 My view: if cryptos are about to be hit by major selling, Coinbase's business prospects will implode. The current Seeking Alpha Quant Valuation Grade of ""D-"" may prove overly optimistic, given operating results slide in 2025-26. Seeking Alpha Table - Coinbase Global, Quant Valuation Grade, August 19th, 2024 I remain in the Strong Sell camp for a Coinbase Global rating, using a 12-month outlook. Transitioning from purely a boom overvaluation story early in 2024, the chart momentum setup is now screaming loudly to get out of the way before the next cryptocurrency bust arrives. Shareholders must understand a return trip to $100 or even $50 is not impossible, similar to early 2023's price. It's too much risk for me. I cannot afford to take a -50% or -75% hit on my money, especially when the technicals are this bad as a red-flag warning. Thanks for reading.

42390574,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd3ncx,1724143701,Floki Scores Major Deals With English Premier League Teams,"Floki has signed deals with various English Premier League teams to feature its FLOKI token and upcoming game, Valhalla.  FLOKI will be the cryptocurrency partner for Nottingham Forest, Valhalla will appear on Sunderland AFC jerseys and on-screen ads during all league games.  Floki's approach to sponsorships bypasses traditional bidding processes through direct contacts, aiming to increase brand visibility and community engagement at a lower cost compared to other major crypto projects.  Meme coin Floki's FLOKI token and Valhalla game will feature on various English Premier League (EPL) properties as part of an initial one-year contract to help boost visibility for the $1.2 billion capitalization token.  The English Premier League sit on the top tier of England's football pyramid, and features twenty local teams. It is the most-valued football league as per sports data site Transfermarkt.  Floki has been steadily trying to move away from its meme status, building the metaverse game Valhalla, real-world asset tokenization platform TokenFi, and introducing staking and banking features to boost appeal for the FLOKI token.  FLOKI tokens will be the cryptocurrency partner for Nottingham Forest. Their upcoming game Valhalla will feature on the back of the Sunderland AFC jersey, and will additionally be displayed as on-screen ads throughout all league games.  FLOKI jumped as much as 10% after CoinDesk's report on the EPL deals. At the time of writing, the token was up 7% at $0.0001264.  “It is a potential multi-year agreement and a minimum one-year/season deal,” a Floki team member told CoinDesk in an interview. “Regarding the benefits to Floki holders, there are many such as increased brand awareness & recognition as well as the exposure to our ecosystem and community.”  The team did not reveal specific costs for the various sponsorships, citing deal confidentiality. However, head of marketing Sabre told CoinDesk that there was no bidding process as the team had “direct contacts” – circumventing a key step in such deals.  Crypto teams often sponsor sporting events and notable stadiums to boost the visibility of their projects. In 2021, exchange Crypto.com paid $700 million to gain naming rights for the Staples Centre in Los Angeles. Defunct exchange FTX signed multiple hundred million deals to place its brand on sports centers and avenues worldwide, and crypto project Terra signed a five-year contract worth $40 million, with the Washington Nationals in 2022.  It is unclear, however, how much these partnerships eventually help the brands and influence token prices. But Floki's Sabre remains upbeat on the prospects.  “Unlike many exchanges and large projects that invest heavily in securing partnerships, we achieve exceptional value by spending a fraction of the cost. Our direct relationships with well-established and highly respected organizations enable us to maximize our impact in the blockchain space.”  “As we've seen with similar timing and partnerships from top exchanges, we expect this exposure to capture retail interest as we approach and enter 2025,” they added.

Recent reports revealed the Solana-based investment products were among the largest losers last week after registering over $30 million in outflows. The token continued its sideways trajectory despite the negative net flows and memecoin’s trading activity decline over the week. As a result, SOL’s recent performance was praised by some crypto analysts who deem the cryptocurrency a safe bet. Related Reading: MATIC Price (Polygon) Sets Sights Higher: Can It Gain Bullish Momentum? Solana ETPs See Record Outflows CoinShares’ recent report revealed that last week’s Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) net flows registered a positive but “low” $30 million. The data showed that crypto-based investment products saw minor inflows in the past 7 days, with mixed flows among the providers. Per the report, the established ETP issuers continued to lose market share to providers of the newer investment products. The crypto funds’ weekly trading volume also fell to $7.6 billion, dropping nearly 50% from the $19 billion registered the week prior. Throughout the week, Bitcoin (BTC) saw the largest inflows among the crypto assets, with a $42 million positive net flow. Short-Bitcoin ETFs registered $1 million in outflows on its second consecutive negative week. Ethereum-based products only registered 10% of the flagship cryptocurrency’s inflows, recording $4.2 million since August 12. The positive $104 million net flows from new providers were overshadowed by Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE)’s $118 million in outflows. Nonetheless, Solana investment products had the largest outflow by cryptocurrency after Solana ETPs saw $39 million in negative week flows. 21Shares Solana ETP’s -$37 million ranked third as the largest outflow by investment product last week, only behind ETHE and GBTC. SOL Continue Sideways Trajectory CoinShare’s report highlighted that Solana ETPs’ negative performance occurred alongside the “sharp decline in trading volume of memecoins, on which it heavily relies.” Data from CoinGecko revealed that Solana-based memecoins saw a 3.7% decline in the last 24 hours, registering a $3.59 billion market cap. Its market activity also displayed a similar 3% decline since Sunday, falling to a daily trading volume of $1.1 billion. Despite this, the Solana ecosystem has moved sideways over the weekend, hovering between the $243 billion to $245 billion market cap since August 15. SOL’s price also moved between $140 and $155 over the weekend, a range it has maintained since August 12. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggested that the token will see “more chop and consolidation” in the coming weeks. However, he asserted that the $125-$150 price range is a “great place to accumulate SOL.” The analyst also considers the token “is still 1 you can comfortably hold for a while.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trims Gains: Is The Recovery Losing Steam? Similarly, Crypto Jelle noted SOL’s recent performance, stating that it is “still in the same sideways range, while the rest of the market made lower lows.” To the analyst, SOL will take off hard “as soon as Bitcoin finds a bid,” and a new all-time high (ATH) is “very much on the menu.” As of this writing, SOL is trading at $144, a 1.4% drop in the last 24 hours.

Traders are looking to Jerome Powell's remarks at the end of the week for indications of where prices may go.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} moved past $61,000 early Tuesday as U.S.-spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding the asset recorded their second-highest inflow activity this month.  Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $61 million in net inflows, the highest since $192 million on August 8, data from SoSoValue shows. BlackRock’s IBIT led inflows at $92 million, while Bitwise’s BITB recorded outflows at $25 million.  Japan’s Metaplanet also announced that it had completed another BTC purchase worth $3.4 million (500 million Japanese yen), bringing its total holdings of bitcoin to 360.368 BTC.  Major tokens followed suite, with XRP and BNB Chain’s BNB jumping over 7%, and Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA gaining 4%. Toncoin (TON) declined 0.8% in the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the performance of the largest and most liquid digital assets, is up 4.25%.  Polymarket bettors are predicting some price stability, with the market giving a 66% chance that BTC will remain above $60K by the end of the week.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}} jumped 5% amid technology entrepreneur Elon Musk posting an AI-generated image referring to the token on X. DOGE historically tends to move when Musk posts about the token. However, any price spikes are usually short lived.  PoliFi tokens were also flat, as traders seemed to have lost interest in them. The Trump-themed MAGA token is down 0.3%, according to CoinGecko data, with trading value of $2.5 million. Meanwhile, on Polymarket, Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump 50%-49% as the Presidential election betting contract nears $650 million.  While market catalysts remain far and few as of Tuesday, some traders are expecting market movements nearer to Friday when Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the Jackson Hole symposium.  “This week’s market expectations are built around the Jackson Hole symposium where Monetary Policy is to be discussed,” Abra Prime said in a market note via email. “The narrative focuses on BTC ETFs and their correlation with the stock market.  “We can expect horizontal price action this week before Jackson Hole, with BTC ranging between $56K - $62K with most volume around $58K - $60K,” Abra said.  Powell is expected to confirm a pivot to lower borrowing costs next month, per Bloomberg, a step that has historically buoyed bullish sentiment among traders as cheap access to money spurts growth in riskier sectors. Short-term bearish sentiment remains among some, however, on the decision to pull back on proposed options for BTC ETFs.  “We have seen both NYSE and NASDAQ withdraw their applications to list BTC ETF options over the past 72 hours, adding more headwinds to wider mainstream adoption at least in the short term,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA.org, said in a Telegram message. “TradFi continues to be cautious with ETF ETH buying on the lack of clarity over staking legalities,” Fan added, referring to ether’s (ETH) underperformance compared to bitcoin in the past week.",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC | XRP,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/20/bitcoin-pops-over-61k-xrp-leads-gains-among-majors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1d3d947ca670bbc5272866ca51c0696109b5321-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32613440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636473,1724135420,"Bitcoin Price Could Surge 200% To Cross $100,000 If This Happens","A crypto analyst has predicted that Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency could see its price surging as high as $100,000, representing a 200% increase from its current value. However, the analyst noted that this bullish projection would occur only when certain conditions are met. Bitcoin Could Rise To $100,000 In an X (formerly Twitter) post on August 15, Jamie Coutts, the Chief crypto analyst at Real Vision shared his bullish expectations for Bitcoin in 2024. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin could experience a 200% surge, potentially reaching $100,000 before the end of the year. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin (BTC) Trade Back Above $70,000 By September? Analysts Weigh In Coutts argues that Bitcoin could see significant gains in the near future based on global financial conditions, specifically the actions of Central Banks. The crypto analyst noted that central banks are “capitulating,” and the “liquidity spigots are opening,” signaling that Bitcoin’s price is about to go much higher. Capitulating here means that Central Banks are easing monetary policies, most likely due to economic pressures. Additionally, opening the liquidity spigots suggests that Central Banks are increasing the money supply through various measures. Coutts revealed in his post that the Global Liquidity Momentum Model (MSI) has provided a bullish regime signal for the first time since November 2023. He recalled that after witnessing this signal in 2023, Bitcoin rallied as high as 75% from November 2023 to April 2024, before the regime flipped bearish. The analyst also revealed that over the past month, The Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) have injected substantial capital into the system, amounting to $400 billion and $97 billion, respectively. Globally, the money base (credit) has also expanded by $1.2 trillion, facilitated by the weakening United States Dollar (USD). This decrease also indicates a possible coordination with the US Federal Reserve (FED). Drawing comparisons from previous cycles where Bitcoin rose 19X in 2017 and 6X in 2024, Coutts projects that Bitcoin could witness a 2X to 3X surge in 2024 if the US Dollar Index (DXY) drops below 101. According to TradingView, the US Dollar Index is currently 102.175. A decrease below 101 would likely be a result of continued Central Bank injections that could potentially increase the global money supply (M2) above $120 trillion this cycle. Coutts concluded his Bitcoin bull forecast by noting that in a credit-based fractional reserve banking system, the money supply must continually flow and expand to support the outstanding debt. If it does not, the entire financial system could collapse. Massive BTC Rally Incoming In a more recent X post, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Milkybull Crypto,” shared his highly optimistic projections for Bitcoin. Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin’s movement from 2016 to 2025, the analyst forecasted that Bitcoin is preparing for a “face-melting parabolic that could potentially see its price surging as high as $190,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Facing A Persistent Net Sell-Side Bias, Glassnode Reveals The analyst predicts that this massive surge could occur in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024. He suggests that this potential rally is consistent with historical market patterns, highlighting that “history has indeed prevailed. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $58,548, marking a slight decrease of 1.71% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

Distribution of open interest shows bullish sentiment, according to Wintermute.  Crypto traders speculating on how the impending U.S. elections might affect the digital assets industry have locked millions in bitcoin {{BTC}} options tied to the event.  The so-called election expiry options, due for settlement four days after the Nov. 4 elections, began trading on Deribit a month ago. As of writing, the notional open interest or the dollar value of the number of active options contracts was $345.83 million, according to data source Amberdata.  Call options, which offer an unlimited upside payoff potential at the expense of limited loss, accounted for 67% of the total open interest. The rest came from put options, which offer protection against price drops, amounting to a put-call ratio of less than 0.50.  In other words, twice as many calls were open as puts, reflecting bullish expectations from the outcome of the elections.  ""These election-dedicated contracts allow investors to capitalize on the increased interest by speculating on how the election might affect the crypto markets in a targeted way. The current put-call ratio of 0.50 indicates a bullish sentiment, with twice as many calls traded as puts,"" algorithmic trading firm Wintermute said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  The call option at the strike price of $80,000 is the most popular, boasting an open interest of over $39 million. Broadly speaking, open interest is mainly concentrated in higher strike calls, starting from $70,000 to $140,000. That's a sign of traders positioning for new record highs around the election time.  Meanwhile, $39 million is locked in the $45,000 put option.  ""The concentration of call options' open interest at strikes around $80K and $100K suggests that market participants are positioning for potential upside in bitcoin, while the presence of puts at lower strike price of $45,000 indicates some level of hedging or downside protection,"" Wintermute noted.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/20/us-elections-linked-bitcoin-options-draw-nearly-350m-in-open-interest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5592476820232b842afa085c40e9385984c1a23c-1412x1040.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32611014,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636557,1724130023,Ethereum Transaction Costs Hit Historic Lows: What Does This Mean For ETH?,"According to recent insights from a CryptoQuant analyst, Ethereum’s daily mean gas price has reached an all-time low, falling to roughly 2.9 Gwei. This decline in gas prices correlates with a significant drop in daily transaction fees, which now average merely $0.85, marking a multi-year low for the network. The analyst reported that this cost reduction comes amid a stable or slightly increasing daily transaction volume compared to the past two years, suggesting that lower fees haven’t deterred user activity on the network. Despite drastically reduced costs, a sustained number of transactions indicates strong network health and continued user engagement, even as financial barriers lessen. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Poised for Inflation? Supply Reaches New High as Staking Takes Off Reason Behind The Plunge In Transaction Costs Discussing the reason behind the historic lows in the Ethereum fee structure, the CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym ‘EgyHash’ attributed it to the Dencun upgrade implemented on March 13 this year. This update introduced ‘Blobs’—a novel transaction type designed to economize data publishing for Layer 2 networks on Ethereum. Networks such as Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism can post their data on Ethereum at substantially reduced fees, potentially eliminating costs by up to 100%. This enhancement has directly contributed to the lowered gas prices and has made Ethereum a more accessible platform for a broader user base, the analyst disclosed. #Ethereum Gas Price Hits New All-Time Low “Despite the approval of Ethereum ETFs, the price of $ETH has been struggling since the Dencun upgrade. ETH supply has increased by more than 197,000 ETH, and its price has fallen by 35%.” – By @EgyHashX Link 👇https://t.co/GZ1Dt0NStv pic.twitter.com/PtbjWGyUzc — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) August 19, 2024 However, EgyHash also highlighted that although lower transaction costs benefit users by making the network more affordable for various applications, they pose a nuanced challenge for investors. EgyHash noted in the post: While low fees are beneficial for users, they might not be advantageous for investors, especially given the substantial portion of Ethereum’s usage that is being offloaded to its Layer 2 networks, and the potential problems this could cause, such as user and liquidity fragmentation. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Reach Over $3,000 In September? Analyst Bets On 80% Odds Ethereum Market Performance So far, ETH has been unable to maintain its price above notable price marks. Over the past week, ETH has plunged by 4.2%–this bearish performance has brought the asset to currently trade for $2,591 at the time of writing. As highlighted by EgyHash, this struggle for the ETH’s price to hit new heights has been around since the Dencun upgrade and has continued despite the recent approval of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Bitcoin Daily Realized Profit Loss Ratio Has Dipped Below 1 Recently As explained by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, realized losses have started to exceed profits recently. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “Daily Realized Profit Loss Ratio,” which, as its name suggests, tells us about how the Bitcoin investors’ profits compare against the losses. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin sold to see what price it was moved at before this. If this previous selling price for any coin was less than the current spot price, then that particular coin is being moved at a profit. Related Reading: When To Be Bearish On Bitcoin? On-Chain Analyst Answers Similarly, sales of coins of the opposite type lead to loss realization. The indicator adds these profits and losses for the entire market and takes their ratio to produce its value. When the indicator is above 1, the investors realize more profits than losses with their selling. On the other hand, this threshold implies the dominance of loss-taking in the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Daily Realized Profit Loss Ratio over the past few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Daily Realized Profit Loss Ratio has mostly been above 1 for the past year. Not just that, the indicator has been significantly above the mark for a lot of this time, which suggests profit realization has been quite notable. The reason behind this is the appreciation the BTC price has enjoyed during this period. From the chart, it’s visible that peak profit-taking coincided with the all-time high (ATH) in March, as would be expected. Interestingly, profit-taking still massively outweighed the loss-taking in the months that followed the ATH, where BTC price consolidated inside a range. It would appear that this appetite for taking profits has run out recently, a potential result of the sideways trajectory showing no signs of ending. The ratio has now started to flip the other way, with losses taking center stage. The analyst has noted that such a shift towards loss-taking generally occurs at the end of consolidation periods. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Still In A Bull Market,” Quant Says—Here’s Why So far, the lowest the ratio has gone is 0.66, which is not too low compared to past loss-taking events. Thus, the capitulation may deepen before Bitcoin can start a fresh rally. BTC Price Bitcoin has recently continued to be locked in a sideways trajectory as its price still trades around $58,400.

Onchain data expert James Check highlighted this in a recent post on X, disclosing that over 80% of Bitcoin’s short-term holders, those holding their BTC for less than 155 days, have bought their tokens at prices higher than the current market rate. Underwater Investors, Implication For Bitcoin This situation of the majority of short-term holders being in the red (at a loss), as pointed out by Check, is quite similar to the scenario that took place in “2018, 2019, and mid-2021, which signaled many investors were at risk of panicking and precipitating a bearish trend.” Right now, over 80% of #Bitcoin Short-Term Holders are underwater, meaning their coin was acquired at a price above the current spot price. This is similar to 2018, 2019, and mid-2021 which signalled many investors were at risk of panicking, and precipitating a bearish trend. pic.twitter.com/8jM7PBqh5z — _Checkmate 🟠🔑⚡☢️🛢️ (@_Checkmatey_) August 19, 2024 Despite the bleak outlook suggested by the high percentage of underwater short-term holders, the implications for the market are nuanced. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Momentum In Hashrate Despite Failure To Beat $60,000 Resistance Check highlighted that the psychological impact on holders varies greatly depending on the extent of their losses. He elaborates that a minor unrealized loss, such as 1%, has a significantly different psychological effect on an investor than a more substantial loss of 20%. Despite the high percentage of holders facing losses, the total unrealized loss across the market equates to only 4% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. This indicates that while the sentiment may be bearish, the financial impact might not be as severe as expected. BTC Market Performance And Outlook Bitcoin has continued to gradually plunge towards the downsides, breaking multiple supports. Over the past week, the asset has declined by 1.7% and further down by 2.7% in the past day. This bearish performance has brought the asset to trade as low as $57,918 earlier today before now, retracing slightly to trade at $58,339 at the time of writing. Interestingly, despite the decline, BTC’s daily trading volume has seen quite the opposite performance. According to data from CoinGecko, this metric has increased from below $17 billion at the start of today to roughly $22.6 billion.

32605411,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636606,1724117425,Monday’s Crypto Leaderboard: BNB And XRP Surge Past Market Leaders,"In a significant development, two of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on the market, Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP, have emerged as the outperformers this Monday, overshadowing the gains of industry leaders Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). XRP Price Analysis XRP, the token associated with the blockchain company Ripple, has taken the lead among the top 10 cryptocurrencies surging nearly 6%. The token’s price reached a near two-week high of $0.6080 earlier on Monday, coupled with a 197% increase in trading volume over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. Despite the XRP price later retracing to the $0.590 mark, the token’s ability to briefly consolidate above the critical $0.600 resistance level has raised hopes among investors. To sustain the current price recovery, bulls will need to keep a close eye on the next hurdles at $0.6169 and $0.6288. A daily close above these levels could signal a breakout from the token’s one-month downtrend. Related Reading: MATIC Price (Polygon) Sets Sights Higher: Can It Gain Bullish Momentum? Notably, XRP is currently trading above its 200-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) at $0.5516 and $0.5716, marked by the yellow and blue lines, respectively, on the XRP/USDT daily chart below. As seen in the past uptrends of this year, these key technical indicators can provide support for the price in case of a broader market correction that could trigger additional selling pressure. Binance Coin Surges To Two-Week High Binance Coin on the other hand, the native token of the leading Binance exchange, has also seen a surge, jumping 3% in the last 24 hours to reach a two-week high of $554. This comes after the token dipped as low as $399 on August 5, during the market’s “Black Monday” event. Similar to XRP, Binance Coin has also recorded a notable spike in trading volume, with a 30% increase in the same time frame, amounting to $800 million as CoinGecko data shows. While the BNB price currently stands 22.68% below its all-time high of $717 recorded on June 6, the potential breach of the upper resistance on its daily chart could pave the way for a retest of this milestone. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Turns Lower: Can ETH Bounce Back From $2,550? In the near term, the key for the Binance Coin price is to consolidate above its 200-day EMA placed at $547, which would then open the door to retest the $574 resistance level, the most notable one on this time frame, before a potential surge toward $600. Conversely, the previous range low of $502 experienced at the beginning of the month has acted as a major support for the Binance Coin token after the August 5 crash, serving as a key support level in the shorter term for the BNB price. Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether this surge in altcoins can be sustained in the face of broader market uncertainties and a lack of fresh capital flowing into the crypto space.

42390576,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd3ni5,1724115932,Solana's Former Top Decentralized Crypto Exchange Faces SEC Securities Violations,"Mango Markets, Solana's once-mighty decentralized crypto exchange that was gutted by convicted fraudster Avraham Eisenberg, is preparing to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission over allegations that it violated a litany of securities laws.  The governing entity that manages Mango Markets, Mango DAO, on Monday opened voting on a ""SEC settlement offer proposal"" that would see the group pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines, destroy its holdings of MNGO tokens and seek its delisting from other trading venues.  The SEC hasn't yet accepted the proposal. But if this vote passes (it already has enough votes to sail through), and the agency does accept it, Mango Markets' future could become highly uncertain.  It was not immediately clear how Mango Markets' day-to-day functions would survive if the MNGO governance token that investors use to vote on everything from token listings and buybacks to debt repayments – not to mention SEC settlements – becomes obsolete.  Mango Markets has struggled to recover from opportunist trader Avraham Eisenberg's debilitating ""highly profitable trading strategy"" that in October 2022 drained the protocol of $110 million and led to Eisenberg's groundbreaking criminal fraud and manipulation trial of misdeeds in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Shortly before that trial, CoinDesk reported that Mango Markets faced a ""regulatory inquiry."" The proposal aired Monday revealed some of the contours of that probe. In addition to the SEC, Mango Markets is being investigated by the Department of Justice and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission.  Only the SEC's investigation is at issue in Monday's proposed settlement offer. According to the proposal, Mango DAO is facing allegations it sold an unregistered security. Mango Labs, the developer of Mango Markets, is facing charges it acted as an unlicensed broker. A related entity, Blockworks Foundation (not the media group), also is staring at similar claims from regulators.  The proposed settlement would see Mango DAO neither admit nor deny wrongdoing. It proposes paying a fine of $223,228. The DAO's treasury currently holds nearly $2 million in USDC and a variety of other assets whose practical value was not immediately clear.  The SEC did not respond to a request for comment.  During Solana's 2021 summer bull run, Mango Markets made headlines by selling $70 million of MNGO tokens to the public.  As CoinDesk reported at the time: ""The sale was closed to U.S. investors, likely in an attempt to stave off the regulatory scrutiny that can hamstring similar projects – sometimes years down the line.""",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/20/solanas-former-top-decentralized-crypto-exchange-faces-sec-securities-violations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05713e5a33d1af625c75f6c4661ee27b6d406527-5760x3240.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Interestingly, developers activated smart contracts around the top of this cycle after completing the Alonzo hard fork, ushering in the Goguen phase. Did Alonzo And Smart Contracts Kill ADA? However, as Atomic Wallet analysts note, ADA has been on a downtrend since then, crumbling by over 90% over the years at the time of writing. ADA is changing hands at $0.32 when writing, finding immediate support at around $0.30, a psychological number. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Momentum In Hashrate Despite Failure To Beat $60,000 Resistance Though traders are optimistic about what lies ahead, the turn of events over the last three years could suggest that the activation of smart contracts on Cardano did “kill” the coin’s valuation. The plummeting prices, made worse by the 2022 crypto winter, mean those who bought in August 2021 are holding mud. Whether ADA will recover in the coming weeks and rewind losses of 2022 remains to be seen. What’s clear is that the activation of the Alonzo hard fork and the start of the Goguen era was a key milestone for Cardano. The transition was crucial considering that before September 2021, developers couldn’t deploy dApps and take on Ethereum and competing properties supporting smart contracts. For years, since the genesis block, Cardano developers have been accused of delaying the process while using billions for development. After Alonzo, users can, even now, create complex smart contracts using Plutus scripts and run dApps. Like other blockchains, all fees are payable in ADA, the native token. Over the years, Cardano has grown its ecosystem, looking at the total value locked (TVL). According to DeFiLlama, DeFi protocols on Cardano, active after Alonzo, now manage over $177 million in assets. Though relatively low compared to those in Ethereum and the BNB Chain, developers took advantage of smart contracts and built solutions on the network. Cardano Transitioning To Voltaire: Will Things Change? The current disconnect between ADA valuation and the expectation of coin holders post-Goguen is a concern. It is so especially as Cardano completes the Basho stage, moving to Voltaire, the final phase of the platform’s development. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Reach Over $3,000 In September? Analyst Bets On 80% Odds Voltaire focuses on making Cardano governance decentralized. Here, ADA will have more utility, allowing holders to vote on proposals and directly helping improve the network. Additionally, there will be a treasury for funding projects deploying on Cardano. So far, the Chang hard fork is in progress, with roughly 33% of all stake pool operators (SPOs) ready. Meanwhile, ADA remains under immense selling pressure and could plunge to 2023 lows of around $0.22 if buyers don’t step in. If prices rise above $0.50, bulls will likely push ADA toward March 2024 highs.
